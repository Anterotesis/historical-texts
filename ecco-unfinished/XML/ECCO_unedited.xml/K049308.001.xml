<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE purchasers of D. Hume's History of
England having been long desirous of a continu∣ation;
the proprietor of Dr. Smollet's History
(being in possession of a copy with the author's
last corrections) has been induced to reprint
that work, from the Revolution, where Hume's
History ends, to the death of George II. in the
year 1760.</P>
<P>To make this work more acceptable, the Sec∣tions,
and other divisions, are given in a manner
correspondent with those observed by Hume; so
that any gentleman, possessed of the latter, may
take up his History at the Revolution, where Hume
breaks off, and find a regular connexion in this
complete History given by Smollet.</P>
<P>In the latter part only of this work has the present
Editor found it necessary to make any alterations.
The war before the last had its source in America,
and thereby drew forth our settlements there into
consequence. This with the loss of most of those
settlements since to Great-Britain, had brought
<PB REF="4"/>
with it so many changes, that what was sound
politicks and good sense then, is now totally de∣ranged;
even facts themselves are become changed,
and the very state of the two countries has under∣gone
a metamorphosis which was impossible to be
foreseen by the shrewdest politician. To assist the
views of so eminent a writer as Smollet, as well
as to gratify the expectations of the judicious
reader, a few, very few, alterations have been
made on those heads. To have proceeded farther
would have been a kind of sacrilege, and no less a
fraud upon the original author, than upon the
publick.</P>

§ I. THE constitution of England had now as∣sumed
a new aspect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1689.</NOTE> The maxim of here∣ditary,
indefeasible right was at length renounced
by a free parliament. The power of the crown was
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
acknowledged to flow from no other fountain than
that of a contract with the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1689.</NOTE> Allegiance and pro∣tection
were declared reciprocal ties depending upon each
other. The representatives of the nation made a regular
claim of rights in behalf of their constituents; and Wil∣liam
III. ascended the throne in consequence of an express
capitulation with the people. Yet, on this occasion, the
zeal of the parliament towards their deliverer seems to
have overshot their attachment to their own liberty and
privileges: or at least they neglected the fairest oppor∣tunity
that ever occurred, to retrench those prerogatives
of the crown to which they imputed all the late and former
calamities of the kingdom. Their new monarch retained
the old regal power over parliaments in its full extent.
He was left at liberty to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and
dissolve them at his pleasure. He was enabled to influence
elections, and oppress corporations. He possessed the right
of choosing his own council; of nominating all the great
officers of the state, and of the household, of the army, the
navy, and the church. He reserved the absolute com∣mand
of the militia: so that he remained master of all
the instruments and engines of corruption and violence,
without any other restraint than his own moderation, and
prudent regard to the claim of rights, and principle of
resistance, on which the Revolution was founded. In a
word, the settlement was finished with some precipitation,
before the plan had been properly digested and matured;
and this will be the case in every establishment formed
upon a sudden emergency in the face of opposition. It
was observed, that the King, who was made by the people,
had it in his power to rule without them; to govern <HI>jure
divino,</HI> though he was created <HI>jure humano;</HI> and that,
though the change proceeded from a republican spirit, the
settlement was built upon Tory maxims; for the execution
of his government continued still independent of his com∣mission,
while his own person remained sacred and in∣violable.
The Prince of Orange had been invited to
England by a coalition of parties, united by a common
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
sense of danger: but this tie was no sooner broken than
they flew asunder, and each resumed its original biass.
Their mutual jealousy and rancour revived, and was
heated by dispute into intemperate zeal and enthusiasm.
Those who at first acted from principles of patriotism
were insensibly warmed into partisans; and King William
soon found himself at the head of a faction. As he had
been bred a Calvinist, and always expressed an abhorrence
of spiritual persecution, the presbyterians, and other pro∣testant
dissenters, considered him as their peculiar pro∣tector,
and entered into his interests with the most zealous
fervour and assiduity. For the same reasons, the friends
of the church became jealous of his proceedings, and em∣ployed
all their influence, first in opposing his elevation to
the throne, and afterwards in thwarting his measures.
Their party was espoused by all the friends of the lineal
succession; by the roman catholics; by those who were
personally attached to the late King; and by such as were
disgusted by the conduct and personal deportment of Wil∣liam
since his arrival in England. They observed, That,
contrary to his declaration, he had plainly aspired to the
crown; and treated his father-in-law with insolence and
rigour: That his army contained a number of foreign
papists, almost equal to that of the English roman catho∣lics
whom James had employed: That the reports so in∣dustriously
circulated about the birth of the Prince of
Wales, the treaty with France for enslaving England,
and the murder of the Earl of Essex, reports countenanced
by the Prince of Orange, now appeared to be without
foundation: That the Dutch troops remained in London,
while the English forces were distributed in remote quar∣ters:
That the Prince declared the first should be kept
about his person, and the latter sent to Ireland: That the
two Houses, out of complaisance to William, had denied
their late sovereign the justice of being heard in his own
defence; and, That the Dutch had lately interfered with
the trade of London, which was already sensibly dimi∣nished.
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
These were the sources of discontent, swelled up by
the resentment of some noblemen, and other individuals,
disappointed in their hopes of profit and preferment.</P>
<P>§ II. William began his reign with a proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somers's Collection. Reresby. Burnet.</NOTE>
for confirming all protestants in the offices which they
enjoyed on the first day of December: then he chose the
members of his council, who were generally staunch to
his interest, except the archbishop of Canterbury and the
Earl of Nottingham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The council consisted of the Prince of Denmark, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Norfolk, the Marquisses of Hallifax and Winchester, the Earls of Danby, Lindsey, Devonshire, Dorset, Middlesex, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Bedford, B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, Maccl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>field, and Nottingham; the Viscounts Fauconberg, Mordaunt, Newport, Lumley; the Lords Wharton, Monta∣gue, Delamere, Churchill; Mr. Bentinck, Mr. Sidney, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Henry Capel, Mr. Powle, Mr. Russel, Mr. Hambden, and Mr. Boseawen.</NOTE>; and these were admitted in com∣plaisance
to the church-party, which it was not thought
adviseable to provoke. Nottingham and Shrewsbury were
appointed secretaries of state: the privy-seal was bestowed
upon the Marquis of Hallifax: the Earl of Danby was
created president of the council. These two noblemen
enjoyed a good share of the King's confidence, and Not∣tingham
was considerable, as head of the church-party:
but the chief favourite was Bentinck, first commoner on
the list of privy-counsellors, as well as groom of the stole
and privy purse. D'Auverquerque was made master of
the horse, Zuylestein of the robes, and Schomberg of the
ordnance: the Treasury, Admiralty, and Chancery were
put in commission: twelve able judges were chosen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir John Holt was appointed Lord-Chief-Justice of the King's-Bench, and Sir Henry Pollexsen of the Common-Pleas: the Earl of Devonshire was made lord-steward of the household, and the Earl of Dorset lord-chamber∣lain.—Ralph.</NOTE>;
and the diocese of Salisbury being vacated by the death of
Dr. Ward, the King, of his own free motion, filled it
with Burnet, who had been a zealous stickler for his
interest; and, in a particular manner, instrumental in
effecting the Revolution. Sancroft, Archbishop of Can∣terbury,
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
refused to consecrate this ecclesiastic, though
the reasons of his refusal are not specified; but, being
afraid of incurring the penalties of a premunire, he granted
a commission to the Bishop of London, and three other
suffragans, to perform that ceremony. Burnet was a
prelate of some parts, and great industry; moderate in his
notions of church-discipline, inquisitive, medling, vain,
and credulous. In consequence of having incurred the
displeasure of the late King, he had retired to the conti∣nent,
and fixed his residence in Holland, where he was
naturalized, and attached himself to the interest of the
Prince of Orange, who consulted him about the affairs of
England. He assisted in drawing up the Prince's manifesto,
and wrote some other papers and pamphlets in defence of
his design. He was demanded of the States, by the
English ambassador, as a British fugitive, outlawed by
King James, and excepted in the act of indemnity: never∣theless,
he come over with William, in quality of his
chaplain; and, by his intrigues, contributed in some
measure to the success of that expedition. The principal
individuals that composed this ministry have been cha∣racterised
in the history of the preceding reigns. We
have had occasion to mention the fine talents, the vivacity,
the flexibility of Hallifax; the plausibility, the enter∣prising
genius, the obstinacy of Danby; the pompous
eloquence, the warmth, and ostentation of Notingham;
the probity and popularity of Shrewsbury. Godolphin,
now brought into the Treasury, was modest, silent, saga∣cious,
and upright. Mordaunt, appointed first com∣missioner
of that board, and afterwards created Earl of
Monmouth, was open, generous, and a republican in
his principles. Delamere, chancellor of the exchequer,
promoted in the sequel to the rank of Earl of Warrington,
was close and mercenary. Obsequiousness, fidelity, and
attachment to his master, composed the character of
Bentinck, whom the king raised to the dignity of Earl of
Portland. The English favourite, Sidney, was a man of
wit and pleasure, possessed of the most engaging talents for
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
conversation and private friendship, but rendered unfit
for public business by indolence and inattention. He
was ennobled and afterwards created Earl of Romney;
a title which he enjoyed with several successive posts of
profit and importance. The stream of honour and
preferment ran strong in favour of the Whigs, and this
appearance of partiality confirmed the suspicion and re∣sentment
of the opposite party.</P>
<P>§ III. The first resolution taken in the new council
was to convert the convention into a parliament, that the
new settlement might be strengthened by a legal sanction,
which was now supposed to be wanting, as the assembly
had not been convoked by the King's writ of summons.
The experiment of a new election was deemed too hazar∣dous;
therefore, the council determined that the King
should, by virtue of his own authority, change the con∣vention
into a parliament, by going to the House of Peers
with the usual state of a sovereign, and pronouncing a
speech from the throne to both Houses. This expedient
was accordingly practised<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This expedient was attended with an insurmountable absurdity. If the majority of the convention could not grant a legal sanction to the establish∣ment they had made, they could never invest the Prince of Orange with a just right to ascend the throne; for they could not give what they had no right to bestow, and if he ascended the throne without a just title, he could have no right to sanctify that assembly to which he owed his elevation. When the people are obliged by tyranny, or other accidents, to have recourse to the first principles of society, namely their own preservation, in electing a new sovereign, it will deserve consideration, whether that choice is to be effected by the majority of a parliament which has been dissolved, indeed by any par∣liament whatsoever, or by the body of the nation assembled in communi∣ties, corporations, by tribes or centuries, to signify their assent or dissent with respect to the person proposed as their sovereign This kind of election might be attended with great inconvenience and difficulty, but these can∣not possibly be avoided when the constitution is dissolved by setting a side the lineal succession to the throne. The constitution of England is founded on a parliament consisting of King, Lords, and Commons; But when there is no longer a King, the parliament is defective, and the constitution impaired: the members of the Lower House are the representatives of the people, ex∣pressly chosen to maintain the constitution in church and state, and sworn to support the rights of the crown, as well as the liberties of the nation; but though they are elected to maintain, they have no power to alter the constitution. When the King forfeits the allegiance of his subjects, and it becomes necessary to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrone him, the power of so doing cannot possibly reside in the representatives who are chosen, under certain limitations, for the purposes of a legislature which no longer exists; their power is of course at an end, and they are reduced to a level with other individuals that constitute the community. The right of altering the constitution, therefore, or of deviating from the established practice of inheritance in regard to the succession of the crown, is inherent in the body of the people, and every individual has an equal right to his share in the general determination, whether his opinion be signified <HI>viva voce,</HI> or by a representative whom he appoints and instructs for the purpose. It may be suggested that the Prince of Orange was raised to the throne without any convulsion, or any such difficulties and inconveniencies as we have affirmed to be the necessary con∣sequences of a measure of that nature. To this remark we answer, that since the Revolution these kingdoms have been divided and barrassed by vio∣lent and implacable factions, that eagerly seek the destruction of each other; that they have been exposed to plots, conspiracies, insurrections, civil wars, and successive rebellions, which have not been defeated and quelled with∣out vast effusion of blood, infinite mischief, calamity, and expence to the nation; that they are still subjected to all those alarms and dangers which are engendered by a disputed title to the throne, and the efforts of an artful Pretender; that they are necessarily wedded to the affairs of the continent, and their interest sacrificed to foreign connexions, of which they can never be disengaged. Perhaps all these calamities might have been prevented by the interposition of the Prince of Orange. King James, without forfeit∣ing the crown, might have been laid under such restrictions that it would not have been in his power to tyrannize over his subjects either in spirituals or temporals. The power of the militia might have been vested in the two Houses of parliament, as well as the nomination of persons to fill the great offices of the church and state, and superintend the oeconomy of the admi∣nistration, in the application of the publick money: a law might have passed for annual parliaments, and the King might have been deprived of his power to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and dissolve them at his pleasure. Had these measures been taken, the King must have been absolutely disabled from employing either force or corruption in the prosecution of arbitrary designs, and the people must have been fairly represented in a rotation of parlia∣ments whose power and influence would have been but of one year's du∣ration.</NOTE>. He assured them he should
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
never take any step that would diminish the good opinion
they had conceived of his integrity. He told them that
Holland was in such a situation as required their imme∣diate
attention and assistance: that the posture of affairs
at home likewise demanded their serious consideration:
that a good settlement was necessary, not only for the
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
establishment of domestic peace, but also for the support
of the protestant interest abroad: that the affairs of Ireland
were too critically situated to admit of the least delay in
their deliberations: he, therefore, begged they would be
speedy and effectual in concerting such measures as should
be judged indispensably necessary for the welfare of the
nation. The Commons returning to their house, imme∣diately
passed a vote of thanks to his Majesty, and made
an order that his speech should be taken into considera∣tion.
After the throne had been declared vacant by a
small majority of the peers, those who opposed that mea∣sure
had gradually withdrawn themselves from the House;
so that very few remained but such as were devoted to the
new monarch. These, therefore, brought in a bill for
preventing all disputes concerning the present parliament.
In the mean time, Mr. Hambden in the Lower House put
the question, Whether a king elected by the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and the Commons assembled at Westmin∣ster,
coming to and consulting with the said Lords and
Commons, did not make as complete a parliament, and
legislative power and authority, as if the said king should
cause new elections to be made by writ? Many members
affirmed, that the King's writ was as necessary as his pre∣sence
to the being of a legal parliament, and, as the
convention was defective in this particular, it could not
be vested with a parliamentary authority by any manage∣ment
whatsoever. The Whigs replied, That the essence
of a parliament consisted in the meeting and co-operation
of the King, Lords, and Commons; and that it was not
material whether they were convoked by writ or by letter:
they proved this assertion by examples deduced from the
history of England: they observed, that a new election
would be attended with great trouble, expence, and loss
of time; and that such delay might prove fatal to the
protestant interest in Ireland, as well as to the allies on
the continent. In the midst of this debate, the bill was
brought down from the Lords, and being read, a committee
was appointed to make some amendments. These were
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
no sooner made than the Commons sent it back to the
Upper House, and it immediately received the royal assent.
By this act the Lords and Commons assembled at West∣minster
were declared the two Houses of parliament to
all intents and purposes: it likewise ordained, That the
present act, and all other acts to which the royal assent
should be given before the next prorogation, should be
understood and adjudged in law to begin on the thirteenth
day of February: That the members, instead of the old
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, should take the new
oath incorporated in this act under the ancient penalty;
and, That the present parliament should be dissolved in
the usual manner. Immediately after this transaction, a
warm debate arose in the House of Commons about the
revenue which the courtiers alledged had devolved with
the crown upon William, at least, during the life of
James; for which term the greater part of it had been
granted. The members in the opposition affirmed that
these grants were vacated with the throne; and at length
it was voted, That the revenue had expired. Then a
motion was made, That a revenue should be settled on
the King and Queen; and the House resolved it should be
taken into consideration. While they deliberated on this
affair, they received a message from his Majesty, im∣porting,
that the late King had set sail from Brest with an
armament to invade Ireland. They forthwith resolved to
assist his Majesty with their lives and fortunes: they voted
a temporary aid of four hundred and twenty thousand
pounds, to be levied by monthly assessment; and both
Houses waited on the King to signify this resolution. But
this unanimity did not take place till several Lords
spiritual as well as temporal had, rather than take the
oaths, absented themselves from parliament. The non∣juring
prelates were Sancro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Archbishop of Canterbury,
Turner, Bishop of Ely, Lake, of Chichester, Ken, of
Bath and Wells, White, of Peterborough, Lloyd, of
Norwich, Thomas, of Worcester, and Frampton, of
Gloucester. The temporal peers who refused the oath,
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
were the Duke of Newcastle, the Earls of Clarendon,
Litchfield, Exeter, Yarmouth, and Stafford; the Lords
Griffin and Stawel. Five of the bishops withdrew them∣selves
from the House at one time: but, before they re∣tired,
one of the number moved for a bill of toleration,
and another of comprehension, by which moderate
dissenters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted
into ecclesiastical benefices. Such bills were actually pre∣pared
and presented by the Earl of Nottingham, who
received the thanks of the House for the pains he had taken.
From this period, the party averse to the government of
William were distinguished by the appellation of Non∣jurors.
They rejected the notion of a king <HI>de facto,</HI> as
well as all other distinctions and limitations; and declared
for the absolute power, and divine hereditary indefeasible
right of sovereigns.</P>
<P>§ IV. This faction had already begun to practise against
the new government. The King having received some
intimation of their designs from intercepted letters,
ordered the Earl of Arran, Sir Robert Hamilton, and
some other gentlemen of the Scottish nation, to be appre∣hended,
and sent prisoners to the Tower. Then he in∣formed
the two Houses of the step he had taken, and even
craved their advice with regard to his conduct in such a
delicate affair, which had compelled him to trespass upon
the law of England. The Lords thanked him for the care
he took of their liberties, and desired he would secure all
disturbers of the peace: but the Commons empowered
him by a bill to dispense with the Habeas Corpus act till
the seventeenth day of April next ensuing. This was a
stretch of confidence in the crown which had not been
made in favour of the late King, even while Argyle and
Monmouth were in open rebellion. A spirit of discontent
had by this time diffused itself through the army, and
become so formidable to the court, that the King resolved
to retain the Dutch troops in England, and send over to
Holland in their room such regiments as were most
tinctured with disaffection. Of these the Scottish regiment
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
of Dumbarton, commanded by Mareschal Schomberg,
mutinied on its march to Ipswich, seised the military
chest, disarmed the officers who opposed their design,
declared for King James, and with four pieces of cannon
began their march for Scotland. William being informed
of this revolt, ordered General Ginckel to pursue them
with three regiments of Dutch dragoons, and the muti∣neers
surrendered at discretion. As the delinquents were
natives of Scotland, which had not yet submitted in form
to the new government, the King did not think proper to
punish them as rebels, but ordered them to proceed for
Holland, according to his first intention. Though this
attempt proved abortive, it made a strong impression upon
the ministry, who were divided among themselves, and
wavered in their principles. However, they seised this
opportunity to bring in a bill for punishing mutiny and
desertion, which in a little time passed both Houses, and
received the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ V. The coronation-oath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The new form of the coronation-oath consisted in the following questions and answers. “Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto be∣longing, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same?”</P>
<P>“I solemnly promise so to do.”</P>
<P>“Will you, to your power, cause law and justice in mercy to be executed in all your judgments?” “I will.”—“Will you, to the utmost of your power, maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the gospel, and the protestant reformed religion as by law established? and will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges as, by law, do, or shall appertain unto them or any of them?”</P>
<P>“All this I promise to do.”</P>
<P>Then the King or Queen, laying his or her hand upon the gospels, shall say, “The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep. So help me God.”</P></NOTE> being altered and explained,
that ceremony was performed on the eleventh day of April,
the Bishop of London officiating, at the king's desire, in
the room of the metropolitan, who was a malcontent; and
next day the Commons, in a body, waited on the King
and Queen at Whitehall, with an address of congratula∣tion.
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
William, with a view to conciliate the affection
of his new subjects, and check the progress of clamour
and discontent, signified, in a solemn message to the
House of Commons, his readiness to acquiesce in any
measure they should think proper to take for a new regu∣lation
or total suppression of the hearth-money, which he
understood was a grievous imposition on the subjects; and
this tax was afterwards abolished. He was gratified with
an address of thanks, couched in the warmest expressions
of duty, gratitude, and affection, declaring they would
take such measures in support of his crown, as would
convince the world that he reigned in the hearts of his
people.</P>
<P>§ VI. He had, in his answer to their former address,
assured them of his constant regard to the rights and
prosperity of the nation: he had explained the exhausted
state of the Dutch; expatiated upon the zeal of that re∣public
for the interests of Britain, as well as the mainte∣nance
of the protestant religion; and expressed his hope
that the English parliament would not only repay the
sums they had expended in his expedition, but likewise
further support them to the utmost of their ability
against the common enemies of their liberties and religion.
He had observed that a considerable army and fleet would
be necessary for the reduction of Ireland, and the pro∣tection
of Britain; and he desired they would settle the
revenue in such a manner, that it might be collected with∣out
difficulty and dispute. The sum total of the money
expended by the States-General in William's expedition,
amounted to seven millions of guilders, and the Commons
granted six hundred thousand pounds for the discharge of
this debt, incurred for the preservation of their rights and
religion. They voted funds for raising and maintaining
an army of two and twenty thousand men, as well as for
equipping a numerous fleet: but, they provided for no
more than half a year's subsistence of the troops, hoping
the reduction of Ireland might be finished in that term;
and this instance of frugality the King considered as a
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
mark of their diffidence of his administration. The
Whigs were resolved to supply him gradually, that he
might be the more dependent upon their zeal and attach∣ment:
but he was not at all pleased with their precaution.</P>
<P>§ VII. William was naturally biassed to Calvinism,
and averse to persecution. Whatever promises he had
made, and whatever sentiments of respect he entertained
for the church of England, he seemed now in a great
measure alienated from it, by the opposition he had met
with from its members, particularly from the bishops, who
had thwarted his measures. By absenting themselves
from parliament, and refusing the oath, they had plainly
disowned his title, and renounced his government. He
therefore resolved to mortify the church, and gratify his
own friends at the same time, by removing the obstacles
affixed to nonconformity, that all protestant dissenters
should be rendered capable of enjoying and exercising civil
employments. When he gave his assent to the bill for
suspending the Habeas Corpus act, he recommended the
establishment of a new oath in lieu of those of allegiance
and supremacy: he expressed his hope that they would
leave room for the admission of all his protestant subjects
who should be found qualified for the service: he said,
such a conjunction would unite them the more firmly
among themselves, and strengthen them against their com∣mon
adversaries. In consequence of this hint, a clause
was inserted in the bill for abrogating the old and ap∣pointing
the new oaths, by which the sacramental test was
declared unnecessary in rendering any person capable of
enjoying any office or employment. It was, however,
rejected by a great majority in the House of Lords. Ano∣ther
clause for the same purpose, though in different terms,
was proposed by the King's direction, and met with the
same fate, though in both cases several noblemen entered
a protest against the resolution of the House. These fruit∣less
efforts in favour of dissenters augmented the prejudice
of the churchmen against King William, who would have
willingly compromised the difference, by excusing the
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
clergy from the oaths, provided the dissenters might be
exempted from the sacramental test: but this was deemed
the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the pro∣posal
was rejected. The church-party in the House of
Lords moved, that instead of inserting a clause, obliging
the clergy to take the oaths, the king should be empowered
to tender them; and, in case of their refusal, they should
incur the penalty, because deprivation, or the appre∣hensions
of it, might make them desperate, and excite
them to form designs against the government. This
argument had no weight with the Commons, who thought
it was indispensably necessary to exact the oaths of the
clergy, as their example influenced the kingdom in
general, and the youth of the nation were formed under
their instructions. After a long and warm debate, all
the mitigation that could be obtained, was a clause em∣powering
the king to indulge any twelve clergymen, de∣prived
by virtue of this act, with a third part of their
benefices during pleasure. Thus the ancient oaths of
allegiance and supremacy were abrogated: the declaration
of non-resistance in the act of uniformity was repealed:
the new oath of allegiance was reduced to its primitive
simplicity, and the coronation-oath rendered more explicit.
The clergy were enjoined to take the new oaths before
the first day of August, on pain of being suspended from
their office for six months, and of entire deprivation, in
case they should not take them before the expiration of
this term. They generally complied, though with such
reservations and distinctions as were not much for the
honour of their sincerity.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The King, though baffled in his design against
the sacramental test, resolved to indulge the dissenters
with a toleration; and a bill for this purpose being pre∣pared
by the Earl of Nottingham, was, after some debate,
passed into a law, under the title of, An act for exempt∣ing
their Majesties protestant subjects dissenting from the
church of England from the penalties of certain laws.
It enacted, That none of the penal laws should be con∣strued
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
to extend to those dissenters who should take the
oaths to the present government, and subscribe the decla∣ration
of the thirtieth year of the reign of Charles II.
provided that they should hold no private assemblies or
conventicles with the doors shut; that nothing should be
construed to exempt them from the payment of tithes, or
other parochial duties: That, in case of being chosen into
the offices of constable, church-warden, overseer, &amp;c. and
of scrupling to take the oaths annexed to such offices,
they should be allowed to execute the employment by
deputy: That the preachers and teachers in congregations
of dissenting protestants, who should take the oaths,
subscribe the declaration, together with all the articles of
religion, except the thirty-fourth and the two succeeding
articles, and part of the twentieth, should be exempted
from the penalties decreed against nonconformists, as well
as from serving upon juries, or acting in parish-offices:
yet all justices of the peace were empowered to require
such dissenters to subscribe the declaration, and take the
oaths; and, in case of refusal, to commit them to prison,
without bail or mainprize. The same indulgence was
extended to anabaptists, and even to quakers, on their
solemn promise, before God, to be faithful to the King
and Queen, and their assenting by profession and assevera∣tion
to those articles which the others ratified upon oath:
they were likewise required to profess their belief in the
Trinity and the Holy Scriptures. Even the papists felt
the benign influence of William's moderation in spiritual
matters: he rejected the proposals of some zealots, who
exhorted him to enact severe laws against popish recusants.
Such a measure, he observed, would alienate all the
papists of Europe from the interests of England, and
might produce a new catholic league, which would render
the war a religious quarrel: besides, he could not pre∣tend
to screen the protestants of Germany and Hungary,
while he himself should persecute the catholics of Eng∣land.
He therefore resolved to treat them with lenity; and
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
though they were not comprehended in the act, they
enjoyed the benefit of the toleration.</P>
<P>§ IX. We have observed, that, in consequence of the
motion made by the bishops when they withdrew from
parliament, a bill was brought into the House of Lords for
uniting their Majesties protestant subjects. This was ex∣tremely
agreeable to the King, who had the scheme of
comprehension very much at heart. In the progress of
the bill a warm debate arose about the posture of kneel∣ing
at the sacrament, which was given up in favour of
the dissenters. Another, no less violent, ensued upon
the subsequent question, “Whether there should be an
addition of laity in the commission to be given by the
King to the bishops and others of the clergy, for pre∣paring
such a reformation of ecclesiastical affairs as
might be the means of healing divisions, and correcting
whatever might be erroneous or defective in the consti∣tution?”
A great number of the temporal lords insisted
warmly on this addition, and when it was rejected, four
peers entered a formal protest. Bishop Burnet was a warm
stickler for the exclusion of the laity; and, in all proba∣bility,
manifested this warmth in hopes of ingratiating
himself with his brethren, among whom his character was
very far from being popular. But the merit of this sacri∣fice
was destroyed by the arguments he had used for
dispensing with the posture of kneeling at the sacrament;
and by his proposing in another proviso of the bill, that
the subscribers, instead of expressing assent and consent,
should only submit, with a promise of conformity.</P>
<P>§ X. The bill was with difficulty passed in the House of
Lords: but the Commons treated it with neglect. By this
time, a great number of malcontent members, who had
retired from parliament, were returned, with a view to
thwart the administration, though they could not pre∣vent
the settlement. Instead of proceeding with the bill,
they presented an address to the King, thanking him for
his gracious declaration, and repeated assurances, that he
would maintain the church of England as by law esta∣blished;
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
a church whose doctrine and practice had evinced
its loyalty beyond all contradiction. They likewise
humbly besought his Majesty to issue writs for calling a
convocation of the clergy, to be consulted in ecclesiastical
matters, according to the ancient usage of parliaments;
and they declared they would forthwith take into consi∣deration
proper methods for giving ease to protestant
dissenters. Though the King was displeased at this ad∣dress,
in which the Lords also had concurred, he returned
a civil answer, by the mouth of the Earl of Nottingham,
professing his regard for the church of England, which
should always be his peculiar care, recommending the
dissenters to their protection, and promising to summon a
convocation as soon as such a measure should be conve∣nient.
This method produced no effect in favour of the
bill, which lay neglected on the table. Those who moved
for it had no other view than that of displaying their mo∣deration;
and now they excited their friends to oppose it
with all their interest. Others were afraid of espousing it,
lest they should be stigmatized as enemies to the church;
and a great number of the most eminent presbyterians
were averse to a scheme of comprehension, which di∣minished
their strength, and weakened the importance of
the party. Being, therefore, violently opposed on one
hand, and but faintly supported on the other, no wonder
it miscarried. The King, however, was so bent upon
the execution of his design, that it was next session re∣vived
in another form, though with no better success.</P>
<P>§ XI. The next object that engrossed the attention of
the parliament, was the settlement of a revenue for the
support of the government. Hitherto there had been no
distinction of what was allotted for the King's use, and
what was assigned for the service of the publick; so that
the Sovereign was entirely master of the whole supply. As
the revenue in the late reigns had been often embezzled
and misapplied, it was now resolved that a certain sum
should be set apart for the maintenance of the King's
household, and the support of his dignity; and that the rest
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
of the publick money should be employed under the in∣spection
of parliament. Accordingly, since this period,
the Commons have appropriated yearly supplies to cer∣tain
specified services; and an account of the application
has been constantly submitted to both Houses, at the next
session. At this juncture<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the prevailing party, or the
Whigs, determined that the revenue should be granted
from year to year, or at least for a small term of years,
that the King might find himself dependent upon the par∣liament,
and merit a renewal of the grant by a just and
popular administration. In pursuance of this maxim,
when the revenue fell under consideration, they, on pre∣tence
of charges and anticipations which they had not
time to examine, granted it by a provisional act for one
year only. The civil list was settled at six hundred
thousand pounds, chargeable with the appointments of the
Queen Dowager, the Prince and Princess of Denmark, the
judges, and Mareschal Schomberg, to whom the parliament
had already granted one hundred thousand pounds, in con∣sideration
of his important services to the nation. The
Commons also voted, that a constant revenue of twelve
hundred thousand pounds should be established for the
support of the crown in time of peace.</P>
<P>§ XII. The King took umbrage at these restraints laid
upon the application of the publick money, which were
the most salutary fruits of the Revolution. He considered
them as marks of diffidence, by which he was distinguish∣ed
from his predessors; and thought them an ungrateful
return for the services he had done the nation. The
Tories perceived his disgust, and did not fail to foment his
jealousy against their adversaries, which was confirmed by
a fresh effort of the Whigs, in relation to a militia. A
bill was brought into the House, for regulating it in such a
manner as would have rendered it in a great measure inde∣pendent
both of the King and the lords lieutenants of
counties. These being generally peers, the bill was suf∣fered
to lie neglected on the table: but the attempt con∣firmed
the suspicion of the King, who began to think him∣self
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
in danger of being enslaved by a republican party.
The Tories had, by the canal of Nottingham, made
proffers of service to his Majesty: but complained, at the
same time, that as they were in danger of being prosecuted
for their lives and fortunes, they could not, without an
act of indemnity, exert themselves in favour of the crown,
lest they should incur a persecution from their implacable
enemies.</P>
<P>§ XIII. These remonstrances made such impression on
the King, that he sent a message to the House by Mr.
Hambden, recommending a bill of indemnity as the most
effectual means for putting an end to all controversies,
distinctions, and occasions of discord. He desired it might
be prepared with all convenient expedition, and with such
exceptions only as should seem necessary for the vindi∣cation
of publick justice, the safety of him and his con∣sort,
and the settlement and welfare of the nation. An
address of thanks to his Majesty was unanimously voted.
Nevertheless, his design was frustrated by the backward∣ness
of the Whigs, who proceeded so slowly in the bill,
that it could not be brought to maturity before the end of
the session. They wanted to keep the scourge over the
heads of their enemies, until they should find a proper
opportunity for revenge; and, in the mean time, restrain
them from opposition, by the terror of impending ven∣geance.
They affected to insinuate that the King's design
was to raise the prerogative as high as it had been in the
preceding reigns; and that he for this purpose pressed an
act of indemnity, by virtue of which he might legally use
the instruments of the late tyranny. The Earls of Mon∣mouth
and Warrington industriously infused these jealou∣sies
into the minds of their party: on the other hand, the
Earl of Nottingham inflamed William's distrust of his old
friends: both sides succeeded in kindling an animosity,
which had like to have produced confusion, notwith∣standing
the endeavours used by the Earls of Shrewsbury
and Devonshire to allay those heats, and remove the sus∣picion
that mutually prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25"/>
§ XIV. It was now judged expedient to pass an act for
settling the succession of the crown, according to the
former resolution of the convention. A bill for this pur∣pose
was brought into the Lower House, with a clause dis∣abling
papists from succeeding to the throne: to this the
Lords added, “Or such as should marry papists,” absolv∣ing
the subject in that case from allegiance. The Bishop
of Salisbury, by the King's direction, proposed that the
Princess Sophia, Duchess of Hanover, and her posterity,
should be nominated in the act of succession, as the next
protestant heirs, failing issue of the King, and Anne Prin∣cess
of Denmark. These amendments gave rise to warm
debates in the Lower House, where they were vigorously
opposed, not only by those who wished well in secret to
the late King and the lineal succession; but likewise by
the republican party, who hoped to see monarchy alto∣gether
extinguished in England, by the death of the three
persons already named in the bill of succession. The
Lords insisted upon their amendments, and several fruitless
conferences were held between the two Houses. At length
the bill was dropped for the present, in consequence of an
event which in a great measure dissipated the fears of a
popish successor. This was the delivery of the Princess
Anne, who, on the twenty-seventh day of July, brought
forth a son, christened by the name of William, and after∣wards
created Duke of Gloucester.</P>
<P>§ XV. In the midst of these domestick disputes, William
did not neglect the affairs of the continent. He retained
all his former influence in Holland, as his countrymen
had reason to conside in his repeated assurances of invio∣lable
affection. The great scheme which he had pro∣jected
of a confederacy against France began at this
period to take effect. The Princes of the empire as∣sembled
in the diet solemnly exhorted the Emperor to
declare war against the French King, who had committed
numberless infractions of the treatises of Munster, Osna∣bruck,
Nimeguen, and the truce, invaded their country
without provocation, and evinced himself an inveterate
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
enemy of the holy Roman empire. They, therefore, be∣sought
his Imperial Majesty to conclude a treaty of peace
with the Turks, who had offered advantageous terms, and
proceed to an open rupture with Louis; in which case, they
would consider it as a war of the empire, and support their
head in the most effectual manner. The States-General
published a declaration against the common enemy, taxing
him with manifold infractions of the treaty of commerce;
with having involved the subjects of the Republick in the
persecution which he had raised against the protestants;
with having cajoled and insulted them with deceitful pro∣mises
and insolent threats; with having plundered and
oppressed the Dutch merchants and traders in France;
and, finally, with having declared war against the States,
without any plausible reason assigned. The Elector of
Brandenbourg denounced war against France, as a power
whose perfidy, cruelty, and ambition it was the duty of
every prince to oppose. The Marquis de Castanaga, go∣vernor
of the Spanish Netherlands, issued a counter decla∣ration
to that of Louis, who had declared against his
master. He accused the French King of having laid waste
the empire, without any regard to the obligations of re∣ligion
and humanity, or even to the laws of war; of
having countenanced the most barbarous acts of cruelty
and oppression; and of having intrigued with the enemies
of Christ for the destruction of the empire. The Emperor
negociated an alliance offensive and defensive with the
States-General, binding the contracting parties to co∣operate
with their whole power against France and her
allies. It was stipulated, that neither side should engage
in a separate treaty, on any pretence whatsoever: that no
peace should be admitted, until the treaties of Westphalia,
Osnabruck, Munster, and the Pyrenecs, should have been
vindicated: that, in case of a negociation for a peace or
truce, the transactions on both sides should be communi∣cated
<HI>bona fide;</HI> and that Spain and England should be
invited to accede to the treaty. In a separate article, the
contracting powers agreed, that, in case of the Spanish
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
King's dying without issue, the States-General should
assist the Emperor with all their forces to take possession
of that monarchy: That they should use their friendly
endeavours with the Princes Electors, their allies, towards
elevating his son Joseph to the dignity of King of the Ro∣mans;
and employ their utmost force against France,
should she attempt to oppose his elevation.</P>
<P>§ XVI. William, who was the soul of this confede∣racy,
found no difficulty in persuading the English to un∣dertake
a war against their old enemies and rivals. On
the sixteenth day of April Mr. Hambden made a motion
for taking into consideration the state of the kingdom with
respect to France, and foreign alliances; and the Com∣mons
unanimously resolved, that, in case his Majesty
should think fit to engage in a war with France, they
would, in a parliamentary way, enable him to carry it on
with vigour. An address was immediately drawn up, and
presented to the King, desiring he would seriously consider
the destructive methods taken of late years by the French
King against the trade, quiet, and interest of the nation,
particularly his present invasion of Ireland, and support∣ing
the rebels in that kingdom. They did not doubt but
the alliances already made, and those that might hereafter
be concluded by his Majesty, would be sufficient to reduce
the French King to such a condition, that it should not
be in his power to violate the peace of Christendom; nor
prejudice the trade and prosperity of England: in the
mean time they assured his Majesty he might depend upon
the assistance of his Parliament, according to the vote
which had passed in the House of Commons. This was a
welcome address to King William. He assured them that
no part of the supplies which they might grant for the pro∣secution
of the war should be misapplied; and, on the
seventh day of May, he declared war against the French
Monarch. On this occasion Louis was charged with
having ambitiously invaded the territories of the Emperor,
and denounced war against the allies of England, in vio∣lation
of the treaties confirmed under the guaranty of
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
the English crown; with having encroached upon the
fishery of Newfoundland, invaded the Caribbee islands,
taken forcible possession of New-York and Hudson's-bay,
made depredations on the English at sea, prohibited the
importation of English manufactures, disputed the right
of the flag, persecuted many English subjects on account
of religion, contrary to express treaties and the law of
nations, and sent an armament to Ireland, in support of
the rebels of that kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XVII. Having thus described the progress of the Re∣volution
in England, we shall now briefly explain the
measures that were prosecuted in Scotland, towards the
establishment of William on the throne of that kingdom.
The meeting of the Scottish convention was fixed for the
fourteenth day of March; and both parties employed all
their interest to influence the election of members. The
Duke of Hamilton, and all the presbyterians, declared for
William. The Duke of Gordon maintained the castle of
Edinburgh for his old master: but, as he had neglected
to lay in a store of provisions, he depended entirely upon
the citizens for subsistence. The partisans of James were
headed by the Earl of Balcarras, and Graham Viscount
Dundee, who employed their endeavours to preserve union
among the individuals of their party; to confirm the Duke
of Gordon, who began to waver in his attachment to their
sovereign; and to manage their intrigues in such a man∣ner
as to derive some advantage to their cause from the
transactions of the ensuing session. When the Lords and
Commons assembled at Edinburgh, the Bishop of that dio∣cese,
who officiated as chaplain to the convention, prayed
for the restoration of King James. The first dispute
turned upon the choice of a president. The friends of the
late King set up the Marquis of Athol in opposition to the
Duke of Hamilton; but this last was elected by a conside∣rable
majority; and a good number of the other party,
finding their cause the weakest, deserted it from that mo∣ment.
The Earls of Lothian and Tweedale were sent as
deputies, to require the Duke of Gordon, in the name of
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
the estates, to quit the castle in four and twenty hours,
and leave the charge of it to the protestant officer next in
command. The Duke, though in himself irresolute, was
animated by Dundee to demand such conditions as the
convention would not grant. The negociation proving
ineffectual, the States ordered the heralds, in all their for∣malities,
to summon him to surrender the castle immedi∣ately,
on pain of incurring the penalties of high treason;
and he refusing to obey their mandate, was proclaimed a
traitor. All persons were forbid, under the same penalties,
to aid, succour, or correspond with him; and the castle
was blocked up by the troops of the city.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Next day an express arrived from London,
with a letter from King William to the estates; and, at
the same time, another from James was presented by one
Crane, an English domestick of the abdicated Queen.
William observed that he had called a meeting of their
estates, at the desire of the nobility and gentry of Scotland
assembled at London, who requested that he would take
upon himself the administration of their affairs. He ex∣horted
them to concert measures for settling the peace of
the kingdom upon a solid foundation; and to lay aside
animosities and factions, which served only to impede that
salutary settlement. He professed himself sensible of the
good effects that would arise from an union of the two
kingdoms; and assured them he would use his best en∣deavours
to promote such a coalition. A committee being
appointed to draw up a respectful answer to these assur∣ances,
a debate ensued about the letter from the late King
James. This they resolved to favour with a reading,
after the members should have subscribed an act, declaring,
that notwithstanding any thing that might be con∣tained
in the letter for dissolving the convention, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpeding their procedure, they were a free and law∣ful
meeting of the states; and would continue undissolved,
until they should have settled and secured the protestant
religion, the government, laws, and liberties of the king∣dom.
Having taken this precaution, they proceeded to
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
examine the letter of their late Sovereign, who conjured▪
them to support his interest as faithful subjects, and eter∣nize
their names by a loyalty suitable to their former pro∣fessions.
He said he would not fail to give them such
speedy and powerful assistance as would enable them to
defend themselves from any foreign attempt; and even to
assert his right against those enemies who had depressed it
by the blackest usurpations and unnatural attempts, which
the Almighty God would not allow to pass unpunished.
He offered pardon to all those who should return to their
duty before the last day of the month; and threatened to
punish rigorously such as should stand out in rebellion
against him and his authority.</P>
<P>XIX. This address produced very little effect i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
favour of the unfortunate exile, whose friends were greatly
outnumbered in this assembly. His messenger was ordered
into custody, and afterwards dismissed with a pass instead
of an answer. James, foreseeing this contempt, had, by
an instrument dated in Ireland, authorised the Archbishop
of Glasgow, the Earl of Balcarras, and the Viscount Dun∣dee,
to call a convention of the estates at Stirling. These
three depended on the interest of the Marquis of Atho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and the Earl of Mar, who professed the warmest affection<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the late King; and they hoped a secession of their
friends would embarrass the convention, so as to retard the
settlement of King William. Their expectations, how∣ever,
were disappointed. Athol deserted their cause; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mar suffered himself to be intercepted in his retreat. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
rest of their party were, by the vigilance of the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hamilton, prevented from leaving the convention, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Viscount Dundee, who retreated to the mountains
with about fifty horse, and was pursued by order of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
estates. This design being frustrated, the convention ap∣proved
and recognised, by a solemn act, the conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the nobility and gentlemen who had intreated the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
England to take upon him the administration. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
acknowledged their obligation to the Prince of Orange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who had prevented the destruction of their laws, religion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
and fundamental constitution: they besought his Highness
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o assume the reins of government for that kingdom: they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssued a proclamation, requiring all persons, from sixteen
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sixty, to be in readiness to take arms when called upon
for that purpose: they conferred the command of their
horse-militia upon Sir Patrick Hume, who was formerly
attainted for having been concerned in Argyle's insur∣rection:
they levied eight hundred men for a guard to the
city of Edinburgh, and constituted the Earl of Leven their
commander: they put the militia all over the kingdom
into the hands of those on whom they could rely: they
created the Earl of Mar governor of Stirling castle: they
received a re-enforcement of five regiments from England,
under the command of Mackay, whom they appointed
their general; and they issued orders for securing all dis∣affected
persons. Then they dispatched Lord Ross, with
an answer to King William's letter, professing their
gratitude to their deliverer, and congratulating him upon
his success. They thanked him for assuming the admi∣nistration
of their affairs, and assembling a convention of
their estates. They declared they would take effectual
and speedy measures for securing the protestant religion, as
well as for establishing the government, laws, and liberties
of the kingdom. They assured him they would, as much
as lay in their power, avoid disputes and animosities; and
desired the continuance of his Majesty's care and pro∣tection.</P>
<P>§ XX. After the departure of Lord Ross, they ap∣pointed
a committee, consisting of eight lords, eight
knights, and as many burgesses, to prepare the plan of a
new settlement: but this resolution was not taken with∣out
a vigorous opposition from some remaining adherents
of the late King, headed by the Archbishop of Glasgow,
all the other prelates, except he of Edinburgh, having
already deserted the convention. After warm debates,
the committee agreed in the following vote: “The
estates of the kingdom of Scotland find and declare,
That King James VII. being a professed papist, did
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
assume the royal power, and act as a king, without
ever taking the oath required by law; and had, by the
advice of evil and wicked counsellors, invaded the
fundamental constitution of this kingdom, and altered
it from a legal and limited monarchy to an arbitrary
despotick power, and had governed the same to the
subversion of the protestant religion, and violation o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the laws and liberties of the nation, inverting all the
ends of government; whereby he had forfeited the right
of the crown, and the throne was become vacant.”
When this vote was reported, the Bishop of Edinburgh
argued strenuously against it, as containing a charge of
which the King was innocent; and he proposed that his
Majesty should be invited to return to his Scottish domi∣nions.
All his arguments were defeated or over-ruled,
and the House confirmed the vote, which was immediately
enacted into a law by a great majority. The Lord Presi∣dent
declared the throne vacant, and proposed that it
might be filled with William and Mary, King and Queen
of England. The committee was ordered to prepare an
act for settling the crown upon their Majesties, together
with an instrument of government for securing the subjects
from the grievances under which they laboured.</P>
<P>§ XXI. On the eleventh day of April, this act, with
the conditions of inheritance, and the instrument, were
reported, considered, unanimously approved, and solemnly
proclaimed at the market-cross of Edinburgh, in presence
of the Lord President, assisted by the Lord Provost and
magistracy of the city, the Duke of Queensberry, the
Marquisses of Athol and Douglas, together with a great
number of the nobility and gentry. At the same time they
published another proclamation, forbidding all persons to
acknowledge, obey, assist, or correspond with the late▪
King James; or, by word, writing, or sermon, to dispute
or disown the royal authority of King William and Queen
Mary; or to misconstrue the proceedings of the estates,
or create jealousies or misapprehensions with regard to the
transactions of the government, on pain of incurring the
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
most severe penalties. Then, having settled the corona∣tion-oath,
they granted a commission to the Earl of
Argyle for the Lords, to Sir James Montgomery for the
Knights, and to Sir John Dalrymple for the Boroughs,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpowering them to repair to London, and invest their
Majesties with the government. This affair being dis∣cussed,
the convention appointed a committee to take care
of the publick peace, and adjourned to the twenty-first
day of May. On the eleventh day of that month, the
Scottish commissioners being introduced to their Majesties
at Whitehall, presented first a preparatory letter from the
estates, then the instrument of government, with a paper
containing a recital of the grievances of the nation; and
an address, desiring his Majesty to convert the convention
into a parliament. The King having graciously promised
to concur with them in all just measures for the interest of
the kingdom, the coronation-oath was tendered to their
Majesties by the Earl of Argyle. As it contained a
clause, importing, that they should root out heresy, the
King declared, that he did not mean by these words, that
he should be under an obligation to act as a persecutor:
the commissioners replying, that such was not the mean∣ing
or import of the oath, he desired them, and others
present, to bear witness to the exception he had made.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In the mean time, Lord Dundee exerted him∣self
with uncommon activity in behalf of his master. He
had been summoned by a trumpet to return to the conven∣tion,
but refused to obey the citation, on pretence that
the Whigs had made an attempt upon his life; and that
the deliberations of the estates were influenced by the
neighbourhood of English troops, under the command of
Mackay. He was forthwith declared a fugitive, outlaw,
and rebel. He was rancorously hated by the presbyterians,
on whom he had exercised some cruelties, as an officer
under the former government; and for this reason the
States resolved to inflict upon him exemplary punishment.
Parties were detached in pursuit of him and Balcarras.
This last fell into their hands, and was committed to a
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
common prison; but Dundee fought his way through the
troops that surrounded him, and escaped to the Highlands,
where he determined to take arms in favour of James,
though that prince had forbid him to make any attempt of
this nature, until he should receive a re-enforcement from
Ireland. While this officer was employed in assembling
the clans of this party, King William appointed the Duke
of Hamilton commissioner to the convention parliament.
The post of secretary for Scotland was bestowed upon
Lord Melvil, a weak and servile nobleman, who had taken
refuge in Holland from the violences of the late reigns:
but the King depended chiefly for advice upon Dalrymple,
Lord Stair, President of the College of Justice, an old
crafty fanatick, who for fifty years had complied in all
things with all governments. Though these were rigid
presbyterians, the King, to humour the opposite party, ad∣mitted
some individuals of the episcopal nobility to the
Council-Board; and this intermixture, instead of allaying
animosities, served only to sow the seeds of discord and confu∣sion.
The Scottish convention, in their detail of grievances,
enumerated the lords of the articles; the act of parliament
in the reign of Charles II. by which the King's supremacy
was raised so high that he could prescribe any mode of reli∣gion
according to his pleasure; and the superiority of any
office in the church above that of presbyters. The King,
in his instructions to the Lord Commissioner, consented
to a regulation of the lords of the articles, though he
would not allow the institution to be abrogated; he was
contented that the act relating to the King's supremacy
should be rescinded, and that the church-government
should be established in such a manner as would be most
agreeable to the inclination of the people.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. On the seventeenth day of June Duke Ha∣milton
opened the Scottish parliament, after the conven∣tion
had assumed this name, in consequence of an act
passed by his Majesty's direction; but the members in
general were extremely chagrined when they found the
commissioners so much restricted in the affair of the lords
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
of the articles, which they considered as their chief
grievance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lords of the articles, by the gradual usurpartion of the crown, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ually constituted a grievance intolerable in a free nation. The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> powered the commissioner to choose eight bishops, whom he authorised <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nominate eight noblemen: these together chose eight barons, and eight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rgesses; and this whole number, in conjunction with the officers of state <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supernumeraries, constituted the lords of the articles. This committee <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssessed the sole exclusive right and liberty of bringing in motions, making <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertures for redressing wrongs, and proposing means and expedients for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> relief, safety, and benefit of the subjects.—<HI>Proceedings of the Scots Parlia∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt vindicated.</HI></NOTE>. The King permitted that the Estates should
choose the lords by their own suffrages; and that they
should be at liberty to reconsider any subject which the
said lords might reject. He afterwards indulged the three
estates with the choice of eleven delegates each, for this
committee, to be elected monthly, or oftener, if they
should think fit: but even these concessions proved unsa∣tisfactory,
while the institution itself remained. Their
discontents were not even appeased by the passing of an
act, abolishing prelacy. Indeed their resentment was in∣flamed
by another consideration; namely, that of the
King's having given seats in the council to some indivi∣duals
attached to the hierarchy. They manifested their
sentiments on this subject by bringing in a bill, excluding
from any public trust, place, or employment under their
Majesties all such as had been concerned in the encroach∣ments
of the late reign, or had discovered disaffection to
the late happy change, or in any way retarded or ob∣structed
the designs of the convention. This measure
was prosecuted with great warmth; and the bill passed
through all the forms of the House, but proved ineffec∣tual,
for want of the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. Nor were they less obstinate in the affair of
the judges, whom the King had ventured to appoint by
virtue of his own prerogative. The malcontents brought
in a bill declaring the bench vacant, as it was at the
restoration; asserting their own right to examine and ap∣prove
those who should be appointed to fill it; providing
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
that if in the time to come any such total vacancy shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
occur, the nomination should be in the King or Queen
or regent for the time being, and the parliament retai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the right of approbation; and that all the clauses in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several acts relating to the admission of the ordinary lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of session, and their qualifications for that office, shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be ratified and confirmed for perpetual observation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was the interest of this party, that the bill was carried by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
great majority, notwithstanding the opposition of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ministers, who resolved to maintain the King's nomina∣tion,
even in defianceof a parliamentary resolution. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
majority, exasperated at this open violation of their pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vileges,
forbad the judges whom the King had appointe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to open their commissions or hold a session until his Ma∣jesty's
further pleasure should be known: on the other han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they were compelled to act by the menaces of the privy
council. The dispute was carried on with great acrimon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on both sides, and produced such a ferment, that before th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
session opened the ministry thought proper to draw a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
number of forces into the neighbourhood of Edinburg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to support the judges in the exercise of their functions.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The Lord Commissioner, alarmed at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
scene of tumult and confusion, adjourned the house <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the eighth day of October; a step which, added to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
other unpopular measures of the court, incensed the oppo∣sition
to a violent degree. They drew up a remonstranc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the King, complaining of this adjournment while th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nation was yet unsettled, recapitulating the several in∣stances
in which they had expressed their zeal and affectio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for his Majesty; explaining their reasons for dissentin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from the Ministry in some articles; beseeching him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
consider what they had represented, to give his royal asse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to the acts of parliament which they had prepared, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
take measures for redressing all the other grievances of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nation. This address was presented to the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Hampton-court. William was so touched with the re∣proaches
it implied, as if he had not fulfilled the condition
on which he accepted the crown of Scotland, that he, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
his own vindication, published his instructions to the
commissioner; and by these it appeared, that the Duke
might have proceeded to greater lengths in obliging his
countrymen. Before the adjournment, however, the
parliament had granted the revenue for life; and raised
money for maintaining a body of forces, as well as for
supporting the incidental expense of the government for
some months: yet part of the troops in that kingdom
were supplied and subsisted by the administration of Eng∣land.
In consequence of these disputes in the Scottish
parliament, their church was left without any settled form
of government; for, though the hierarchy was abolished,
the presbyterian discipline was not yet established, and
ecclesiastical affairs were occasionally regulated by the
privy-council, deriving its authority from that very act of
supremacy, which, according to the claim of rights,
ought to have been repealed.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The session was no sooner adjourned than
Sir John Lanier converted the blockade of Edinburgh∣castle
into a regular siege, which was prosecuted with
such vigour, that in a little time the fortifications were
ruined, and the works advanced to the foot of the walls,
in which the besiegers had made several large breaches.
The Duke of Gordon, finding his ammunition expended,
his defenses destroyed, his intelligence entirely cut off,
and despairing of relief from the adherents of his master,
desired to capitulate, and obtained very favourable terms
for his garrison; but he would not stipulate any conditions
for himself, declaring, that he had so much respect for
all the princes descended from King James VI. that he
would not affront any of them so far as to insist upon
terms for his own particular: he, therefore, on the
thirteenth day of June, surrendered the castle and himself
at discretion. All the hopes of James and his party were
now concentred in the Viscount Dundee, who had
assembled a body of Highlanders, and resolved to attack
Mackay, on an assurance he had received by message,
that the regiment of Scottish dragoons would desert that
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
officer, and join him in the action. Mackay, having re∣ceived
intimation of this design, decamped immediately,
and by long marches retired before Dundee, until he was
re-enforced by Ramsey's dragoons, and another regiment
of English insantry: then he faced about, and Dundee in
his turn retreated into Lochabar. Lord Murray, son of
the Marquis of Athol, assembled his vassals to the number
of twelve hundred men for the service of the regency;
but he was betrayed by one of his own dependants, who
seised the castle of Blair for Dundee, and prevailed upon
the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hol men to disperse, rather than fight against James
their lawful sovereign.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The Viscount was by this time reduced to
great difficulty and distress. His men had not for many
weeks tasted bread or salt, or any drink but water: instead
of five hundred infantry, three hundred horse, with a
supply of arms, ammunition, and provision, which James
had promised to send from Ireland, he received a re∣enforcement
of three hundred naked recruits; but the
transports with the stores fell into the hands of the English.
Though this was a mortifying disappointment he bore it
without repining; and, far from abandoning himself to
despair, began his march to the castle of Blair, which was
threatened with a siege by General Mackay. When he
reached this fortress, he received intelligence that the
enemy had entered the pass of Killycrankie, and he re∣solved
to give them battle without delay. He accord∣ingly
advanced against them, and a furious engagement
ensued, though it was not of long duration. The High∣landers
having received and returned the fire of the
English, fell in among them sword in hand with such im∣petuosity,
that the foot were utterly broke in seven minutes.
The dragoons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led at the first charge in the utmost con∣sternation:
Dundee's horse, not exceeding one hundred,
broke through Mackay's own regiment: the Earl of
Dumbarton, at the head of a few volunteers made him∣self
master of the artillery: twelve hundred of Mackay's
forces were killed on the spot, five hundred taken pri∣soners,
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
and the rest fled with great precipitation for some
hours, until they were rallied by their general, who was
an officer of approved courage, conduct, and experience.
Nothing could be more complete or decisive than the
victory which the Highlanders obtained; yet it was dearly
purchased with the death of their beloved chieftain the
Viscount Dundee, who fell by a random-shot in the
engagement, and his fate produced such confusion in his
army as prevented all pursuit. He possessed an enterprising
spirit, undaunted courage, inviolable fidelity, and was
peculiarly qualified to command the people who fought
under his banner. He was the life and soul of that cause
which he espoused, and after his death it daily declined
into ruin and disgrace. He was succeeded in command by
Colonel Cannon, who landed the re-enforcement from
Ireland; but all his designs miscarried: so that the clans,
wearied with repeated misfortunes, laid down their arms
by degrees, and took the benefit of a pardon, which King
William offered to those who should submit within the
time specified in his proclamation.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. After this sketch of Scottish affairs, it will
be necessary to take a retrospective view of James, and
relate the particulars of his expedition to Ireland. That
unfortunate Prince and his Queen were received with the
most cordial hospitality by the French monarch, who
assigned the castle of St. Germain for the place of their
residence, supported their household with great magnifi∣cence,
enriched them with presents, and undertook to
re-establish them on the throne of England. James,
however, conducted himself in such a manner as con∣veyed
no favourable idea of his spirit and understanding.
He seems to have been emasculated by religion: he was
deserted by that courage and magnanimity for which his
youth had been distinguished. He did not discover great
sensibility at the loss of his kingdom. All his faculties
were swallowed up in bigotry. Instead of contriving
plans for retrieving his crown, he held conferences with
the jesuits on topicks of religion. The pity which his
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
misfortunes excited in Louis was mingled with contempt.
The Pope supplied him with indulgences, while the
Romans laughed at him in pasquinades; “There is a pious
man (said the Archbishop of Rheims ironically)
who has sacrificed three crowns for a mass.” In a word,
he subjected himself to the ridicule and raillery of the
French nation.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. All the hope of reascending the British throne
depended upon his friends in Scotland and Ireland.
Tyrconnel, who commanded in this last kingdom, was
confirmed in his attachment to James, by the persuasions
of Hamilton, who had undertaken for his submission to
the Prince of Orange. Nevertheless, he disguised his
sentiments, and temporised with William, until James
should be able to supply him with re-enforcements from
France, which he earnestly sollicited by private messages.
In the mean time, with a view to cajole the protestants of
Ireland, and amuse King William with hope of his sub∣mission,
he persuaded the Lord Mountjoy, in whom the
protestants chiefly consided, and Baron Rice, to go in
person with a commission to James, representing the
necessity of yielding to the times, and of waiting a fitter
opportunity to make use of his Irish subjects. Mountjoy,
on his arrival at Paris, instead of being favoured with an
audience by James, to explain the reasons which Tyr∣connel
had suggested touching the inability of Ireland to
restore his Majesty, was committed prisoner to the Bastile,
on account of the zeal with which he had espoused the
protestant interest. Although Louis was sincerely dis∣posed
to assist James effectually, his intentions were
obstructed by the disputes of his ministry. Louvois
possessed the chief credit in council; but, Seignelai en∣joyed
a greater share of personal favour, both with the
King and Madame de Maintenon, the favourite concubine.
To this nobleman, as secretary for marine affairs, James
made his chief application; and he had promised the com∣mand
of the troops destined for his service to Lausun,
whom Louvois hated. For these reasons this minister
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
thwarted his measures, and retarded the assistance which
Louis had promised towards his restoration.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Yet, notwithstanding all his opposition, the
succours were prepared, and the fleet ready to put to sea
by the latter end of February. The French King is said
to have offered an army of fifteen thousand natives of
France to serve in this expedition: but James replied,
that he would succeed by the help of his own subjects, or
perish in the attempt. Accordingly, he contented himself
with about twelve hundred British subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James in this expedition was attended by the Duke of Berwick, and by his brother, Mr. Fitzjames grand prior, the Duke of Powis, the Earls of Dover, Melfort, Abercorn, and Seaforth; the Lords Henry and Thomas Howard, the Lords Drummond, Dungan, Trendraught, Buchan, Hunsdon, and Brittas; the Bishops of Chester and Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way, the late Lord-Chief-Justice Herbert; the Marquis D'Estrades, M. de Rosene, mareschal de camp; Mamoe, Pu∣signan, and Lori Lieutenant-Generals, Prontee Engineer-General; the Marquis d'Albeville, Sir John Sparrow, Sir Roger Strickland, Sir William Jennings, Sir Henry Bond, Sir Charles Carney, Sir Edward Vaudrey, Sir Charles Murray, Sir Robert Parker, Sir Alphonso Maiolo, Sir Samuel Foxon, and Sir William Wallis; by the Colonels Porter, Sarsfield, Anthony and John Hamilton, Simon and Henry Luttrel, Ramsay, Dorrington, Sutherland, Clifford, Parker, Purcel, Cannon, and Fielding, with about two-and-twenty other officers of inferior rank.</NOTE>, and a good
number of French officers, who were embarked in the
fleet at Brest, consisting of fourteen ships of the line,
seven frigates, three fireships, with a good number of
transports. The French King also supplied him with a
considerable quantity of arms for the use of his adherents
in Ireland; accommodated him with a large sum of money,
superb equipages, store of plate, and necessaries of all
kinds for the camp and the household. At parting, he
presented him with his own cuirass, and embracing him
affectionately, “The best thing I can wish you (said he)
is that I may never see you again.” On the seventh
day of March James embarked at Brest, together with the
Count D'Avaux, who accompanied him in quality of
ambassador, and his principal officers. He was detained
in the harbour by contrary winds till the seventeenth day
of the month, when he set sail, and on the twenty-second
landed at Kinsale in Ireland. By this time, King William,
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
perceiving himself amused by Tyrconnel, had published a
declaration, requiring the Irish to lay down their arms,
and submit to the new government. On the twenty-second
day of February, thirty ships of war had been put
in commission, and the command of them conferred upon
Admiral Herbert; but, the armament was retarded in
such a manner by the disputes of the council, and the
King's attention to the affairs of the continent, that the
Admiral was not in a condition to sail till the beginning
of April, and then with part of his fleet only. James
was received with open arms at Kinsale, and the whole
country seemed to be at his devotion; for, although the
protestants in the North had declared for the new govern∣ment,
their strength and number was deemed inconsi∣derable
when compared with the power of Tyrconnel.
This minister had disarmed all the other protestant subjects
in one day, and assembled an army of thirty thousand
foot, and eight thousand cavalry, for the service of his
master.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. In the latter end of March, James made his
publick entry into Dublin, amidst the acclamations of
the inhabitants. He was met at the castle-gate by a pro∣cession
of popish bishops and priests in their pontificals,
bearing the host, which he publickly adored. He dismissed
from the Council-Board the Lord Granard, Judge Keat∣ing,
and other protestants, who had exhorted the Lord
Lieutenant to an accommodation with the new govern∣ment.
In their room he admitted the French Ambassador,
the Bishop of Chester, Colonel Dorrington, and, by
degrees, the principal noblemen who accompanied him in
the expedition. On the second day after his arrival in
Dublin, he issued five proclamations: the first recalled all
the subjects of Ireland who had abandoned the kingdom,
by a certain time, on pain of outlawry and confiscation,
and requiring all persons to join him against the Prince of
Orange. The second contained expressions of acknow∣ledgement
to his catholic subjects for their vigilance and
fidelity, and an injunction to such as were not actually in
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
his service, to retain and lay up their arms until it should
be found necessary to use them for his advantage. By the
third he invited the subjects to supply his army with pro∣visions;
and prohibited the soldiers to take any thing
without payment. By the fourth he raised the value of
the current coin; and in the fifth he summoned a parlia∣ment
to meet on the seventh day of May at Dublin.
Finally, he created Tyrconnel a duke, in consideration
of his eminent services.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The adherents of James in England pressed
him to settle the affairs of Ireland immediately, and bring
over his army either to the north of England, or the west
of Scotland, where it might be joined by his party, and
act without delay against the usurper; but his council
dissuaded him from complying with their sollicitations,
until Ireland should be totally reduced to obedience. On
the first alarm of an intended massacre, the protestants of
Londonderry had shut their gates against the regiment
commanded by the Earl of Antrim, and resolved to defend
themselves against the Lord-Lieutenant. They trans∣mitted
this resolution to the government of England,
together with an account of the danger they incurred by
such a vigorous measure, and implored immediate assist∣ance.
They were accordingly supplied with some arms
and ammunition, but did not receive any considerable
re-enforcement till the middle of April, when two regi∣ments
arrived in Loughfoyl, under the command of Cun∣ningham
and Richards. By this time, King James had
taken Coleraine, invested Killmore, and was almost in
sight of Londonderry. George Walker, Rector of
Donaghmore, who had raised a regiment for the defence
of the protestants, conveyed this intelligence to Lundy,
the governor. This officer directed him to join Colonel
Crafton, and take post at the Long-causey, which he
maintained a whole night against the advanced guard of
the enemy, until being overpowered by numbers, he re∣treated
to Londonderry, and exhorted the governor to
take the field, as the army of King James was not yet
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
completely formed. Lundy assembling a council of war,
at which Cunningham and Richards assisted, they agreed,
that as the place was not tenable, it would be imprudent
to land the two regiments; and that the principal officers
should withdraw themselves from Londonderry, the inha∣bitants
of which would obtain the more favourable capitu∣lation
in consequence of their retreat. An officer was
immediately dispatched to King James, with proposals of
a negociation; and Lieutenant-General Hamilton agreed
that the army should halt at the distance of four miles
from the town. Notwithstanding this preliminary, James
advanced at the head of his troops; but met with such a
warm reception from the besieged, that he was fain to
retire to St. John's town in some disorder. The inhabi∣tants
and soldiers in garrison at Londonderry were so in∣censed
at the members in the council of war, who had
resolved to abandon the place, that they threatened imme∣diate
vengeance. Cunningham and Richards retired to
their ships, and Lundy locked himself in his chamber.
In vain did Walker and Major Baker exhort him to main∣tain
his government. Such was his cowardice or trea∣chery,
that he absolutely refused to be concerned in the
defence of the place, and he was suffered to escape in
disguise, with a load of match upon his back; but he was
afterwards apprehended in Scotland, from whence he was
sent to London to answer for his perfidy or misconduct.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. After his retreat, the townsmen chose Mr.
Walker and Major Baker for their governors, with joint
authority; but this office they would not undertake, until
it had been offered to Colonel Cunningham, as the officer
next in command to Lundy. He rejected the proposal,
and with Richards returned to England, where they were
immediately cashiered. The two new governors, thus
abandoned to their fate, began to prepare for a vigorous
defence: indeed, their courage seems to have transcended
the bounds of discretion, for the place was very ill forti∣fied:
their cannon, which did not exceed twenty pieces,
were wretchedly mounted: they had not one engineer to
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
direct their operations: they had a very small number of
horse: the garrison consisted of people unacquainted with
military discipline: they were destitute of provisions:
they were besieged by a King in person, at the head of a
formidable army, directed by good officers, and supplied
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th all the necessary implements for a siege or battle.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his town was invested on the twentieth day of April:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> batteries were soon opened, and several attacks were
made with great impetuosity; but the besiegers were
always repulsed with considerable loss. The townsmen
gained divers advantages in repeated sallies, and would
have held their enemies in the utmost contempt, had not
they been afflicted with a contiguous distemper, as well as
reduced to extremity by want of provision. They were
even tantalized in their distress; for they had the mortifi∣cation
to see some ships which had arrived with supplies
from England prevented from sailing up the river by the
batteries the enemy had raised on both sides, and a boom
with which they had blocked up the channel. At length,
a re-enforcement arrived in the Lough, under the command
of General Kirke, who had deserted his master, and
been employed in the service of King William. He found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans to convey intelligence to Walker, that he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roops and provisions on board for their relief, but found it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpracticable to sail up the river: he promised, however,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he would land a body of forces at the Inch, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavour to make a diversion in their favour, when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined by the troops at Inniskillin, which amounted to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive thousand men, including two thousand cavalry. He
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid he expected six thousand men from England, where
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were embarked before he set sail. He exhorted them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persevere in their courage and loyalty, and assured
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem he would come to their relief at all hazards. These
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssurances enabled them to bear their miseries a little
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onger, though their numbers daily diminished. Major
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aker dying, his place was filled with Colonel Michel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn,
who now acted as colleague to Mr. Walker.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46"/>
§ XXXIV. King James having returned to Dublin, to
be present at the parliament, the command of his army
devolved to the French General Rosene, who was exas∣perated
at such an obstinate opposition by a handful of
half-starved militia. He threatened to raze the town to
its foundations, and destroy the inhabitants, without
distinction of age or sex, unless they would immediately
submit themselves to their lawful sovereign. The governors
treated his menaces with contempt, and published an
order, that no person, on pain of death, should talk of
surrendering. They had now consumed the last remains
of their provision, and supported life by eating the flesh of
horses, dogs, cats, rats, mice, tallow, starch, and salted
hides; and even this loathsome food began to fail. Rosene,
finding them deaf to all his proposals, threatened to wreak
his vengeance on all the protestants of that country, and
drive them under the walls of Londonderry, where they
should be suffered to perish by famine. The Bishop of
Meath, being informed of this design, complained to
King James of the barbarous intention, entreating his
Majesty to prevent its being put in execution. That
prince assured him that he had already ordered Rosene to
desist from such proceedings. Nevertheless, the Frenchman
executed his threats with the utmost rigour. Parties of
dragoons were detached on this cruel service: after having
stripped all the protestants for thirty miles round, they
drove those unhappy people before them like cattle, with∣out
even sparing the enfeebled old men, nurses with
infants at their breasts, tender children, women just de∣livered,
and some even in the pangs of labour. Above
four thousand of these miserable objects were driven under
the walls of Londonderry. This expedient, far from
answering the purpose of Rosene, produced a quite con∣trary
effect. The besieged were so exasperated at this act
of inhumanity, that they resolved to perish rather than
submit to such a barbarian. They erected a gibbet in
sight of the enemy, and sent a message to the French
general, importing, That they would hang all the pri∣soners
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
they had taken during the siege, unless the pro∣testants
whom they had driven under the walls should be
immediately dismissed. This threat produced a negocia∣tion,
in consequence of which the protestants were re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed,
after they had been detained three days without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting food. Some hundreds died of famine or fatigue;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those who lived to return to their own habitations
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und them plundered and sacked by the papists, so that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater number perished for want, or were murdered
by the straggling parties of the enemy: yet these very
people had for the most part obtained protections from
King James, to which no respect was paid by his
general.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The garrison of Londonderry was now
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educed from seven to five thousand seven hundred men,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd these were driven to such extremity of distress, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey began to talk of killing the popish inhabitants, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding on their bodies. In this emergency, Kirke, who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad hitherto lain inactive, ordered two ships laden with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovision to sail up the river, under convoy of the Dart∣mouth
frigate. One of these, called the Mountjoy, broke
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he enemy's boom; and all the three, after having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustained a very hot fire from both sides of the river,
arrived in safety at the town, to the inexpressible joy of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he inhabitants. The army of James were so dispirited
by the success of this enterprise, that they abandoned the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iege in the night, and retired with precipitation, after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving lost about nine thousand men before the place.
Kirke no sooner took possession of the town, than Walker
was prevailed upon to embark for England, with an ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress
of thanks from the inhabitants to their Majesties for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he seasonable relief they had received.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The Inniskilliners were no less remarkable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han the people of Londonderry for the valour and perse∣verance
with which they opposed the papists. They
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aised twelve companies, which they regimented under
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he command of Gustavus Hamilton, whom they chose
for their governor. They proclaimed William and Mary
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
on the eleventh day of March; and resolved in a general
council to maintain their title against all opposition. The
Lord Gilmoy invested the castle of Crom belonging to
the protestants in the neighbourhood of Inniskillin, the
inhabitants of which threw succours into the place, and
compelled Gilmoy to retire to Belturbet. A detachment
of the garrison, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd,
took and demolished the Castle of Aughor, and they
gained the advantage in several skirmishes with the enemy.
On the day that preceded the relief of Londonderry, they
defeated six thousand Irish papists at a place called New∣ton-Butler,
and took their Commander Maccarty, com∣monly
called Lord Moncashel.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The Irish parliament being assembled at
Dublin, according to the proclamation of King James,
he, in a speech from the throne, thanked them for the
zeal, courage, and loyalty they had manifested; extolled
the generosity of the French King, who had enabled him
to visit them in person; insisted upon executing his
design of establishing liberty of conscience as a step
equally agreeable to the dictates of humanity and discre∣tion,
and promised to concur with them in enacting such
laws as would contribute to the peace, affluence, and
security of his subjects. Sir Richard Neagle, being chosen
Speaker of the Commons, moved for an address of thanks
to his Majesty, and that the Count D'Avaux should be
desired to make their acknowledgements to the Most
Christian King, for the generous assistance he had given
to their Sovereign. These addresses being drawn up,
with the concurrence of both Houses, a bill was brought
in to recognize the King's title, to express their abhor∣rence
of the usurpation by the Prince of Orange, as well
as of the defection of the English. Next day James pub∣lished
a declaration, complaining of the calumnies which
his enemies had spread to his prejudice; expatiating upon
his own impartiality in preferring his protestant subjects;
his care in protecting them from their enemies, in re∣dressing
their grievances, and in granting liberty of con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence;
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
promising that he would take no step but with
the approbation of parliament; offering a free pardon to
all persons who should desert his enemies, and join with
him in four-and-twenty days after his landing in Ireland,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> charging all the blood that might be shed upon those
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should continue in rebellion.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. His conduct, however, very ill agreed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th this declaration; nor can it be excused on any other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pposition, but that of his being governed in some cases,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst his own inclination, by the Count D'Avaux, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Irish catholicks, on whom his whole dependence was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced. As both Houses were chiefly filled with members
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that persuasion, we ought not to wonder at their bring∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g
in a bill for repealing the act of settlement, by which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> protestants of the kingdom had been secured in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossession of their estates. These were by this law divested
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their lands, which reverted to the heirs of those catho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cks
to whom they belonged before the rebellion. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iquitous bill was framed in such a manner, that no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egard was paid to such protestant owners as had pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hased
estates for valuable considerations: no allowance
was made for improvements, nor any provision for pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estant
widows: the possessor and tenants were not even
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llowed to remove their stock and corn. When the bill
was sent up to the Lords, Dr. Dopping, Bishop of Meath,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pposed it with equal courage and ability; and an address
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> behalf of the purchasers under the act of settlement was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resented to the King by the Earl of Granard: but, not∣withstanding
these remonstrances, it received the royal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssent; and the protestants of Ireland were mostly ruined.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. Yet, in order to complete their destruction,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> act of attainder was passed against all protestants,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hether male or female, whether of high or low degree,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho were absent from the kingdom, as well as against all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who retired into any part of the three kingdoms,
which did not own the authority of King James, or corre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ponded
with rebels, or were any ways aiding, abetting, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssisting to them from the first day of August in the pre∣ceding
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
year. The number of protestants attainted by
name in this act amounted to about three thousand, in∣cluding
two Archbishops, one Duke, seventeen Earls,
seven Countesses, as many Bishops, eighteen Barons, three-and-thirty
Baronets, one-and-fifty knights, eighty-three
clergymen, who were declared traitors, and adjudged to
suffer the pains of death and forfeiture. The individuals
subjected to this dreadful proscription were even cut off
from all hope of pardon, and all benefit of appeal: for, by
a clause in the act, the King's pardon was deemed null,
unless enrolled before the first day of December. A sub∣sequent
law was enacted, declaring Ireland independent of
the English parliament. This assembly passed another
act, granting twenty thousand pounds per annum, out of
the forfeited estates, to Tyrconnel, in acknowledgement of
his signal services: they imposed a tax of twenty thousand
pounds per month for the service of the King: the royal
assent was given to an act for liberty of conscience: they
enacted that the tithes payable by papists should be de∣livered
to priests of that communion: the maintenance of
the protestant clergy in cities and corporations was taken
away; and all dissenters were exempted from ecclesiasti∣cal
jurisdictions. So that the established church was
deprived of all power and prerogative; notwithstanding
the express promise of James, who had declared, immedi∣ately
after his landing, that he would maintain the clergy
in their rights and privileges.</P>
<P>§ XL. Nor was the King less arbitrary in the executive
part of his government, if we suppose that he counte∣nanced
the grievous acts of opposition that were daily
committed upon the protestant subjects of Ireland: but
the tyranny of his proceedings may be justly imputed to
the temper of his ministry, consisting of men abandoned
to all sense of justice and humanity, who acted from the
dictates of rapacity and revenge, inflamed with all the
acrimony of religious rancour. Soldiers were permitted
to live upon free quarter: the people were robbed and
plundered: licenses and protections were abused, in order
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extort money from the trading part of the nation. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing's old stores were ransacked: the shops of tradesmen,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the kitchens of burghers, were pillaged to supply the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int with a quantity of brass, which was converted into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrent coin for his Majesty's occasions: an arbitrary
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lue was set upon it, and all persons were required and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmanded to take it in payment, under the severest
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nalties, though the proportion between its intrinsick
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth and currency was nearly as one to three hundred.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vast sum of this counterfeit coin was issued in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse of one year, and forced upon the protestants in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayment of merchandise, provision, and necessaries for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing's service. James, not content with the supply
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranted by parliament, imposed by his own authority a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of twenty thousand pounds per month on chattels, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> former was laid upon lands. This seems to have been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>temporary expedient during the adjournment of the two
Houses, as the term of the assessment was limited to three
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onths: it was, however, levied by virtue of a commission
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the seals; and seems to have been a stretch of pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogative,
the less excusable, as he might have obtained
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> money in a parliamentary way. Understanding that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> protestants had laid out all their brass money, in pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hasing
great quantities of hides, tallow, wool, and corn,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assumed the despotick power of fixing the prices of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese commodities and then bought them for his own
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se. One may see his ministers were bent upon the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter destruction of those unhappy people.</P>
<P>§ XLI. All vacancies in publick schools were supplied
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith popish teachers. The pension allowed from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xchequer to the university of Dublin was cut off: the
Vice-provost, Fellows, and scholars were expelled: their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rniture, plate, and publick library, were seised, without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least shadow of pretence, and in direct violation of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romise the King had made to preserve their privileges and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmunities. His officers converted the college into a gar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison,
the chapel into a magazine, and the apartments into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risons: a popish priest was appointed provost: one Mac
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
carty of the same persuasion was made library-keeper; and
the whole foundation was changed into a catholick semi∣nary.
When bishopricks and benefices in the gift of the
crown became vacant, the King ordered the profits to be
lodged in the Exchequer, and suffered the cures to be
totally neglected. The revenues were chiefly employed
in the maintenance of Romish bishops and priests, who
grew so insolent under this indulgence, that in several
places they forcibly seised the protestant churches. When
complaint was made of this outrage, the King promised to
do justice to the injured; and in some places actually
ordered the churches to be restored: but the popish clergy
refused to comply with this order, alledging, that in spiri∣tuals
they owed obedience to no earthly power but the
holy see; and James found himself unable to protect his
protestant subjects against a powerful body which he durst
not disoblige. Some ships appearing in the bay of Dublin,
a proclamation was issued, forbidding the protestants to
assemble in any place of worship, or elsewhere, on pain of
death. By a second, they were commanded to bring in
their arms, on pain of being treated as rebels and traitors.
Luttrel, governor of Dublin, published an ordinance by
beat of drum, requiring the farmers to bring in their corn
for his Majesty's horses within a certain day, otherwise
he would order them to be hanged before their own doors.
Brigadier Sarsfield commanded all protestants of a certain
district to retire to the distance of ten miles from their
habitations, on pain of death; and, in order to keep up
the credit of the brass money, the same penalty was de∣nounced,
in a proclamation, against any person who should
give more than one pound eighteen shillings for a guinea.</P>
<P>§ XLII. All the revenues of Ireland, and all the
schemes contrived to bolster up the credit of this base coin,
would have proved insufficient to support the expenses of
the war, had not James received occasional supplies from
the French monarch. After the return of the fleet which
had conveyed him to Ireland, Louis sent another strong
squadron, commanded by Chateau Renault, as a convoy
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
to some transports laden with arms, ammunition, and a
large sum of money for the use of King James. Before
they sailed from Brest, King William being informed of
their destination, detached Adm. Herbert from Spithead,
with twelve ships of the line, one fireship, and four
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enders, in order to intercept the enemy. He was driven
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stress of weather into Milford-haven, from whence he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eered his course to Kinsale, on the supposition that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench fleet had sailed from Brest; and that in all pro∣bability
he should fall in with them on the coast of Ireland.
On the first day of May he discovered them at anchor in
Bantry-bay, and stood in to engage them, though they
were greatly superior to him in number. They no sooner
perceived him at day-break, than they weighed, stood
out to windward, formed their line, bore down, and be∣gan
the action, which was maintained for two hours with
equal valour on both sides, though the English fleet sus∣tained
considerable damage from the superior fire of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy. Herbert tacked several times, in hope of gaining
the weather-gage: but the French Admiral kept his wind
with uncommon skill and perseverance. At length the
English squadron stood off to sea, and maintained a run∣ning
fight till five in the afternoon, when Chateau Re∣nault
tacked about, and returned into the bay, content
with the honour he had gained. The loss of men was in∣considerable
on both sides; and where the odds were so
great, the victor could not reap much glory. Herbert re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired
to the isles of Scilly, where he expected a re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nforcement:
but being disappointed in this expectation,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> returned to Portsmouth, in very ill humour, with
which his officers and men were infected. The common
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilors still retained some attachment to James, who had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmerly been a favourite among them; and the officers
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omplained that they had been sent upon this service
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith a force so much inferior to that of the enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Reresby. King. Belcarres. De la Fay∣ette. Voltaire.</NOTE> King
William, in order to appease their discontent, made an
excursion to Portsmouth, where he dined with the Ad∣miral
on board the ship Elizabeth, declared his intention
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
of creating him an earl, in consideration of his good con∣duct
and services, conferred the honour of knighthood
on the captains Ashby and Shovel, and bestowed a dona∣tion
of ten shillings on every private sailor.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The parliament of England thought it in∣cumbent
upon them, not only to raise supplies for the
maintenance of the war in which the nation was involved,
but also to do justice with respect to those who had been
injured by illegal or oppressive sentences in the late reigns.
The attainders of Lord Russel, Algernon Sidney, Alder∣man
Cornish, and Lady Lisle, were now reversed. A
committee of privileges was appointed by the Lords, to
examine the case of the Earl of Devonshire, who in the
late reign had been fined in thirty thousand pounds, for
assaulting Colonel Culpepper in the presence-chamber.
They reported that the court of King's-bench, in over∣ruling
the Earl's plea of privilege of parliament, had com∣mitted
a manifest breach of privilege: that the fine was
excessive and exorbitant, against the great charter, the
common right of the subject, and the law of the realm.
The sentence pronounced upon Samuel Johnson, chaplain
to Lord Russel, in consequence of which he had been de∣graded,
fined, scourged, and set in the pillory, was now
annulled, and the commons recommended him to his
Majesty for some ecclesiastical preferment. He received
one thousand pounds in money, with a pension of three
hundred pounds for his own life and that of his son, who
was moreover gratified with a place of one hundred a
pounds a year: but the father never obtained any ecclesi∣astical
benefice. Titus Oates seized this opportunity of
petitioning the House of Lords for a reversal of the judg∣ment
given against him on his being convicted of perjury.
The opinions of all the judges and council at the bar were
heard on this subject, and a bill of reversal passed the
Commons: but the peers having inserted some amend∣ments
and a proviso, a conference was demanded, and
violent heats ensued. Oates, however, was released from
consinement; and the Lords, with the consent of the
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
Commons, recommended him to his Majesty for a par∣don,
which he obtained, together with a comfortable
pension. The committee appointed to enquire into the
cases of the state-prisoners, found Sir Robert Wright,
late Lord Chief Justice, to have been concerned in the
cruelties committed in the West after the insurrection of
Monmouth; as also one of the ecclesiastical commission∣ers,
and guilty of manifold enormities. Death had by this
time delivered Jeffries from the resentment of the nation.
Graham and Burton had acted as solicitors in the illegal
prosecutions carried on against those who opposed the
court in the reign of Charles II. these were now reported
guilty of having been instrumental in taking away the
lives and estates of those who had suffered the loss of ei∣ther
under colour of law, for eight years last past; of ha∣ving,
by malicious indictments, informations, and prose∣cutions
of <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> endeavoured the subversion of
the protestant religion, and the government of the realm;
and of having wasted many thousand pounds of the pub∣lic
revenue in the course of their infamous practices.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. Nor did the misconduct of the present minis∣try
escape the animadversion of the parliament. The
Lords having addressed the King to put the Isle of Wight,
Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, Dover-castle, and the other for∣tresses
of the kingdom, in a posture of defence, and to
disarm the papists, empowered a committee to enquire
into the miscarriages in Ireland, which were generally
imputed to the neglect of the marquisses of Caermarthen
and Hallifax. They presented an address to the King,
desiring the minute-book of the committee for Irish af∣fairs
might be put into their hands: but his Majesty de∣clined
gratifying them in this particular: then the Com∣mons
voted, that those persons who had advised the King
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delay this satisfaction were enemies to the kingdom.
William, alarmed at this resolution, allowed them to in∣spect
the book, in which they found very little for their
purpose. The House resolved that an address should be
presented to his Majesty, declaring that the succour of
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
Ireland had been retarded by unnecessary delays; that the
transports prepared were not sufficient to convey the for∣ces
to that kingdom; and that several ships had been ta∣ken
by the enemy, for want of proper convoy. At the
same time the question was put, Whether or not they
should address the King against the marquis of Hallifax?
but it was carried in the negative by a small majority.
Before this period, Howe, vice-chamberlain to the Queen,
had moved for an address against such counsellors as had
been impeached in parliament, and betrayed the liberties
of the nation. This motion was levelled at Caermarthen
and Hallifax, the first of whom had been formerly im∣peached
of high treason, under the title of Earl of Dan∣by;
and the other was charged with all the misconduct of
the present administration. Warm debates ensued, and
in all probability the motion would have been carried in
the affirmative, had not those who spoke warmly in
behalf of it suddenly cooled in the course of the dispute.
Some letters from King James to his partisans being in∣tercepted,
and containing some hints of an intended inva∣sion,
Mr. Hambden, chairman of the committee of the
whole House, enlarged upon the imminent danger to
which the kingdom was exposed, and moved for a further
supply to his Majesty. In this unexpected motion, he was
not seconded by one member. The House, however,
having taken the letters into consideration, resolved to
draw up an address to the King, desiring him to secure
and disarm all papists of note; and they brought in a bill
for attainting several persons in rebellion against their
Majesties; but it was not finished during this session.</P>
<P>§ XLV. Another bill being prepared in the House of
Lords, enjoining the subjects to wear the woollen manu∣facture
at certain seasons of the year, a petition was pre∣sented
against it by the silk-weavers of London and Can∣terbury,
assembled in a tumultuous manner at West∣minster.
The Lords refused their petition, because this
was an unusual manner of application. They were per∣suaded
to return to their respective places of abode: pre∣cautions
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
were taken against a second riot; and the bill was
unanimously rejected in the Upper House. This parlia∣ment
passed an act, vesting in the two universities the pre∣sentations
belonging to papists: those of the southern
counties being given to Oxford; and those of the nor∣thern
to Cambridge, on certain specified conditions.
Courts of conscience were erected at Bristol, Gloucester,
and Newcastle; and that of the marshes of Wales was
abolished, as an intolerable oppression. The protestant
clergymen, who had been forced to leave their benefices in
Ireland, were rendered capable of holding any living in
England, without forfeiting their title to their former pre∣ferment,
with the proviso that they should resign their
English benesices when restored to those they had been
obliged to relinquish. The statute of Henry IV. against
multiplying gold and silver was now repealed: the subjects
were allowed to melt and refine metals and ores, and ex∣tract
gold and silver from them, on condition that it
should be brought to the Mint, and converted into mo∣ney,
the owners receiving its full value in current coin.
These, and several other bills of smaller importance being
passed, the two houses adjourned to the twentieth day of
September, and afterwards to the nineteenth day of
October.</P>

<P><PB N="55" REF="59"/>
§ I. THOUGH the affairs of Ireland were extremely
pressing, and the protestants of that country had
made repeated application for relief, the succours were
retarded either by the disputes among the ministers, or
the neglect of those who had the management of the ex∣pedition,
in such a manner, that King James had been
six months in Ireland before the army was embarked for
that kingdom. At length, eighteen regiments of infantry,
and five of dragoons being raised for that service, a train
of artillery provided, and transports prepared, the Duke
of Schomberg, on whom King William had conferred
the chief command of this armament, set out for Chester,
after he had in person thanked the Commons for the un∣common
regard they had paid to his services, and received
assurances from the House, that they would pay particular
attention to him and his army. On the thirteenth day of
August he landed in the neighbourhood of Carrickfergus
with about ten thousand foot and dragoons, and took
possession of Belfast, from whence the enemy retired at his
approach to Carrickfergus, where they resolved to make
a stand. The Duke having refreshed his men, marched
thither, and invested the place: the siege was carried on
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
till the twenty-sixth day of the month, when the breaches
being practicable, the besieged capitulated, on condition
of marching out with their arms, and as much baggage
as they could carry on their backs; and of their being
conducted to the next Irish garrison, which was at Newry.
During this siege the Duke was joined by the rest of his
army from England: but, he had left orders for con∣veying
the greater part of the artillery and stores from
Chester directly to Carlingford. He now began his
march through Lisburne and Hillsborough, and encamped
at Drummore, where the protestants of the North had
been lately routed by Hamilton: thence he proceeded to
Loughbrillane, where he was joined by the horse and
dragoons of Inniskillin. Then the enemy abandoned
Newry and Dundalk, in the neighbourhood of which
Schomberg encamped on a low, damp ground, having
the town and river on the south, and surrounded on every
other part by hills, bogs, and mountains.</P>
<P>§ II. His army, consisting chiefly of new-raised men
little inured to hardship, began to flag under the fatigue
of marching, the inclemency of the weather, and scar∣city
of provision. Here he was re-enforced by the regi∣ments
of Kirke, Hanmer, and Stuart; and would have
continued his march to Drogheda, where he understood
Rosene lay with about twenty thousand men, had he not
been obliged to wait for the artillery, which was not yet
arrived at Carlingford. King James, having assembled all
his forces, advanced towards Schomberg, and appeared
before his entrenchments in order of battle: but, the
Duke, knowing they were greatly superior in number of
horse, and that his own army was undisciplined, and
weakened by death and sickness, restrained his men
within the lines, and in a little time the enemy retreated.
Immediately after their departure, a conspiracy was dis∣covered
in the English camp, hatched by some French
papists, who had insinuated themselves into the protestant
regiments. One of these, whose name was Du Plessis,
had written a letter to the Ambassador D'Avaux, pro∣mising
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
to desert with all the papists of the three French
regiments in Schomberg's army. This letter being found,
Du Plessis and five accomplices were tried by a court∣martial,
and executed. About two hundred and fifty
papists being discovered in the French regiments, they
were sent over to England, and from thence to Holland.
While Schomberg remained in this situation, the Inniskil∣liners
made excursions in the neighbourhood, under the
command of Colonel Lloyd; and on the twenty-seventh
day of September they obtained a complete victory over
five times their number of the Irish. They killed seven
hundred on the spot, and took O'Kelly their commander,
with about fifty officers, and a considerable booty of cattle.
The Duke was so pleased with their behaviour on this
occasion, that they received a very honorable testimony
of his approbation.</P>
<P>§ III. Mean while, the enemy took possession of James-Town,
and reduced Sligo, one of the forts of which was
gallantly defended by St. Sauveur, a French captain, and
his company of grenadiers, until he was obliged to capi∣tulate,
for want of water and provision. A contagious
distemper still continued to rage in Schomberg's camp,
and swept off a great number of officers and soldiers; so
that in the beginning of next spring, not above half the
number of those who went over with the General re∣mained
alive. He was censured for his inactivity, and
the King, in repeated letters, desired him to hazard an
engagement, provided any opportunity should occur;
but he did not think proper to run the risque of a battle,
against an enemy that was above thrice his number, well∣disciplined,
healthy, and conducted by able officers.
Nevertheless, he was certainly blameable for having
chosen such an unwholesome situation. At the approach
of winter he retired into quarters, in hopes of being re∣enforced
with seven thousand Danes, who had already
arrived in Britain. These auxiliaries were stipulated in a
treaty which William had just concluded with the King
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
of Denmark. The English were not more successful at
sea than they had proved in their operations by land.
Admiral Herbert, now created Earl of Torrington, having
failed to Ireland with the combined squadrons of England
and Holland, made a fruitless attempt upon Cork, and lost
a great number of seamen by sickness, which was imputed
to bad provision. The Dartmouth ship of war fell into
the hands of the enemy, who infested the channel with
such a number of armed ships and privateers, that the
trade of England sustained incredible damage.</P>
<P>§ IV. The affairs of France wore but a gloomy aspect
on the continent, where all the powers of Europe seemed
to have conspired her construction. King William had en∣gaged
in a new league with the States-General, in which
former treaties of peace and commerce were confirmed.
It was stipulated, that, in case the King of Great-Britain
should be attacked, the Dutch should assist him with six
thousand infantry and twenty ships of the line; and that,
provided hostilities should be committed against the States-General,
England should supply them with ten thousand
infantry and twenty ships of war. This treaty was no
sooner ratified than King William dispatched the Lord
Churchill, whom he had by this time created Earl of
Marlborough, to Holland, in order to command the
British auxiliaries in that service, to the number of eleven
thousand, the greater part of which had been in the army
of King James when the Prince of Orange landed in Eng∣land.
The Earl forthwith joined the Dutch army, under
the command of Prince Waldeck, who had fixed his ren∣dezvous
in the county of Liege, with a view to act against
the French army, commanded by the Mareschal D'Hu∣mieres;
while the Prince of Vaudemont headed a little
army of observation, consisting of Spaniards, Dutch, and
Germans, to watch the motions of Calvo in another part
of the Low-Countries. The city of Liege was compelled
to renounce the neutrality, and declare for the allies.
Mareschal D'Humieres attacked the foragers belonging to
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
the army of the States at Walcourt, in the month of Au∣gust;
an obstinate engagement ensued, and the French
were obliged to retreat in confusion, with the loss of two
thousand men, and some pieces of artillery. The army of
observation levelled part of the French lines on the side of
Courtray, and raised contributions on the territories of the
enemy.</P>
<P>§ V. The French were almost entire masters of the
three ecclesiastical electorates of Germany. They pos∣sessed
Mentz, Triers, Bonne, Keiserswaert, Philipsburgh,
and Landau. They had blown up the castle of Heidel∣berg
in the Palatinate, and destroyed Manheim. They
had reduced Worms and Spires to ashes; and demolished
Frankendahl, together with several other fortresses. These
conquests, the fruits of sudden invasion, were covered with
anumerous army, commanded by the Mareschal de Duras;
and all his inferior generals were officers of distinguished
courage and ability. Nevertheless, he found it difficult
to maintain his ground against the different princes of the
empire. The Duke of Lorraine, who commanded the
Imperial troops, invested Mentz, and took it by capitu∣lation:
the Elector of Brandenburgh, having reduced
Keiserswaert, undertook the siege of Bonne, which the gar∣rison
surrendered, after having made a long and vigorous
defence. Nothing contributed more to the union of the
German Princes than their resentment of the shocking
barbarity with which the French had plundered, wasted,
and depopulated their country. Louis having, by his
intrigues in Poland, and at Constantinople, prevented a
pacification between the Emperor and the Ottoman-porte,
the campaign was opened in Croatia, where five thousand
Turks were defeated by a body of Croats between Vihitz
and Novi. The Prince of Baden, who commanded the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mperialists on that side, having thrown a bridge over the
Morava at Passarowitz, crossed that river, and marched in
quest of the Turkish army, amounting to fifty thousand
men, headed by a Seraskier. On the thirtieth day of
August he attacked the enemy in their entrenchments near
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
Patochin, forced their lines, routed them with grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
slaughter, and took possession of their camp, baggage, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
artillery. They retreated to Nissa, where the Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
finding them still more numerous than the Imperialists
resolved to make a stand; and encamped in a situatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that was inaccessible in every part except the rear, which
he left open for the convenience of a retreat. Through
this avenue, he was, on the twenty-fourth day of Sep∣tember,
attacked by the Prince of Baden, who, after a
desperate resistance, obtained another complete victory,
enriched his troops with the spoils of the enemy; and
entered Nissa without opposition. There he found above
three thousand horses and a vast quantity of provision.
Having reposed his army for a few days in this place, he
resumed his march against the Turks, who had chosen an
advantageous post at Widin, and seemed ambitious of re∣trieving
the honour they had lost in the two former en∣gagements.
The Germans attacked their lines without
hesitation; and though the Mussulmen fought with
incredible fury, they were a third time defeated with great
slaughter. This defeat was attended with the loss of
Widin, which being surrendered to the victor, he distri∣buted
his troops in winter-quarters, and returned to
Vienna, covered with laurels.</P>
<P>§ VI. The French were likewise baffled in their at∣tempt
upon Catalonia, where the Duke de Noailles had
taken Campredon, in the month of May. Leaving a
garrison in this place, he retreated to the frontiers of
France, while the Duke de Villa Hermosa, at the head of
a Spanish army, blocked up the place, and laid Rousillon
under contribution. He afterwards undertook the siege in
form, and Noailles marched to its relief: but, he was so
hard pressed by the Spaniards, that he withdrew the gar∣rison,
dismantled the place, and retreated with great pre∣cipitation.
The French King hoped to derive some con∣siderable
advantage from the death of Pope Innocent XL
which happened on the twel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of August. That
Pontiff had been an inveterate enemy to Louis ever since
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he affair of the franchises, and the seisure of Avignon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The franchises were privileges of asylum, annexed not only to the houses of Ambassadors at Rome, but even to the whole district in which any ambassador chanced to live. This privilege was become a terrible nuisance, in as much as it afforded protection to the most atrocious crimi∣nals, who filled the city with rapine and murther. Innocent XI. resolving to remove this evil, published a bull, abolishing the franchises, and almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the catholick powers of Europe acquiesced in what he had done, upon being duely informed of the grievance. Louis XIV. however, from a spirit of pride and insolence, refused to part with any thing that looked like a prerogative of his crown. He said the King of France was not the imi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator, but a pattern and example for other princes. He rejected with dis∣dain the mild representations of the Pope: he sent the Marquis de Lavar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain as his ambassador to Rome, with a formidable train, to insult Inno∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent even in his own city. That nobleman swaggered through the streets of Rome like a bravo, taking all opportunities to affront the Pope, who excommunicated him in revenge. On the other hand, the parliament of Paris appealed from the Pope's bull to a future council. Louis caused the Pope's Nuncio to be put under arrest, took possession of Avignon which belonged to the See of Rome, and fet the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>
Cabals were immediately formed at Rome by the French
faction against the Spanish and Imperial interest. The
French Cardinals de Bouillon and Bonzi, accompanied
by Furstemberg, repaired to Rome with a large sum of
money. Peter Ottoboni, a Venetian, was elected Pope,
and assumed the name of Alexander VIII. The Duke
de Chaulnes, ambassador from France, immediately signi∣fied,
in the name of his master, that Avignon should be
restored to the patrimony of the church; and Louis
renounced the franchises, in a letter written by his own
hand to the new Pontiff. Alexander received these marks
of respect with the warmest acknowledgements; but, when
the Ambassador and Furstemberg besought him to re∣examine
the election of the Bishop of Cologn, which had
been the source of so much calamity to the empire, he
lent a deaf ear to their sollicitations. He even confirmed
the dispensations granted by his predecessor to the Prince
of Bavaria, who was thus empowered to take possession of
the electorate, though he had not yet attained the age re∣quired
by the canons. Furstemberg retired in disgust to
Paris, where Louis immediately gratified him with the
Abbey of St. Germains.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66"/>
§ VII. King William found it an easier task to unite
the councils of Europe against the common enemy, than
to conciliate and preserve the affections of his own sub∣jects,
among whom he began visibly to decline in point of
popularity. Many were dissatisfied with his measures;
and a great number even of those who exerted themselves
for his elevation, had conceived a disgust from his per∣sonal
deportment, which was very unsuitable to the man∣ners
and disposition of the English people. Instead of
mingling with his nobility in social amusements and fa∣miliar
conversation, he maintained a disagreeable reserve,
which had all the air of sullen pride: he seldom or never
spoke to his courtiers or attendants: he spent his time
chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the closet, retired from all communication; or
among his troops, in a camp he had formed at Hounslow;
or in the exercise of hunting, to which he was immode∣rately
addicted. This had been prescribed to him by phy∣sicians,
as necessary to improve his constitution, which
was naturally weak, and by practice had become so habi∣tual,
that he could not lay it aside. His ill health, co∣operating
with his natural aversion to society, produced
a peevishness which could not fail of being displeasing to
those who were near his person: this was increased by the
disputes in his cabinet, and the opposition of those who
were professed enemies to his government, as well as by
the alienation of his former friends. As he could not
breathe without difficulty in the air of London, he resided
chiefly at Hampton-Court, and expended considerable sums
in beautifying and enlarging that palace: he likewise pur∣chased
the house at Kensington of the Earl of Notting∣ham;
and such profusion, in the beginning of an expensive
war, gave umbrage to the nation in general. Whether he
was advised by his counsellors, or his own sagacity pointed
out the expediency of conforming with the English
humour, he now seemed to change his disposition, and in
some measure adopt the manners of his predecessors. In
imitation of Charles II. he resorted to the races at New∣market:
he accepted an invitation to visit Cambridge,
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
where he behaved with remarkable affability to the mem∣bers
of the University: he afterwards dined with the
Lord-Mayor of London, accepted the freedom of the city,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> condescended so far as to become sovereign-master of
and company of grocers.</P>
<P>§ VIII. While William thus endeavoured to remove
the prejudices which had been conceived against his per∣son,
the period arrived which the parliament had prescribed
for taking the oaths to the new government. Some indi∣viduals
of the clergy sacrificed their benefices to their
scruples of conscience; and absolutely refused to take
oaths that were contrary to those they had already sworn
in favour of their late sovereign. These were distinguished
by the epithet of Nonjurors: but their number bore a
very small proportion to that of others, who took them
with such reservations and distinctions as redounded very
little to the honour of their integrity. Many of those
who had been the warmest advocates for non-resistance
and passive obedience made no scruple of renouncing their
allegiance to King James, and complying with the present
act, after having declared that they took the oaths in no
other sense than that of a peaceable submission to the
powers that were. They even affirmed that the legisla∣ture
itself had allowed the distinction between a King <HI>de
facto</HI> and a King <HI>de jure,</HI> as they had dropped the word
“rightful” when the form was under debate. They
alledged that as prudence obliged them to conform to the
letter of the oath, so conscience required them to give it
their own interpretation. Nothing could be more infa∣mous,
and of worse tendency, than this practice of equivo∣cating
in the most sacred of all obligations. It introduced
a general disregard of oaths, which had been the source
of universal perjury and corruption. Though this set of
temporisers were bitterly upbraided both by the nonjurors
and the papists, they all concurred in representing Wil∣liam
as an enemy to the church; as a Prince educated in
the doctrine of Calvin, which he plainly espoused, by
limiting his favour and preferment to such as were latitu∣dinarians
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
in religion, and by his abolishing episcopacy in
Scotland. The presbyterians of that kingdom now tyran∣nised
in their turn. They were headed by the Earl of
Crawford, a nobleman of a violent temper and strong
prejudices. He was chosen president of the parliament
by the interest of Melvil, and oppressed the episcopalians
in such a manner, that the greater part of them, from re∣sentment,
became well-wishers to King James. Every
circumstance of the hardships they underwent was re∣ported
in England; and the Earl of Clarendon, as well as
the suspended Bishops, circulated these particulars with
great assiduity. The oaths being rejected by the Arch∣bishop
of Canterbury, the Bishops of Ely, Chicester, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, and Gloucester, they were
suspended from their functions, and threatened with de∣privation.
Lake of Chicester being seised with a dange∣rous
distemper, signed a solemn declaration, in which he
professed his adherence to the doctrine of non-resistance
and passive obedience, which he believed to be the distin∣guishing
characteristick of the Church of England. After
his death this paper was published, industriously circulated,
and extolled by the party, as an inspired oracle pronounced
by a martyr to religious truth and sincerity.</P>
<P>§ IX. All the clamour that was raised against the King
could not divert him from prosecuting the scheme of com∣prehension.
He granted a commission under the great
seal to ten bishops, and twenty dignitaries of the church,
authorising them to meet from time to time in the Jeru∣salem-chamber,
to prepare such alteration of the liturgy
and the canons, and such proposals for the reformation of
ecclesiastical courts as might most conduce to the good
order, edification, and uniting of the church, and tend
to reconcile all religious differences among the protestant
subjects of the kingdom. A cry was immediately raised
against this commission, as an ecclesiastical court illegal
and dangerous. At their first meeting, the authority of
the commission was questioned by Sprat, Bishop of Ro∣chester,
who retired in disgust, and was followed by Mew
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
of Winchester, and the Doctors Jane and Aldrich. These
were averse to any alteration of the forms and constitution
of the church, in favour of an insolent and obstinate party,
which ought to have been satisfied with the toleration they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njoyed. They observed, that an attempt to make such
alteration would divide the clergy, and bring the liturgy
into disesteem with the people, as it would be a plain
acknowledgement that it wanted correction. They
thought they should violate the dignity of the church, by
condescending to make offers which the dissenters were at
liberty to refuse; and they suspected some of their col∣leagues
of a design to give up episcopal ordination—a step
inconsistent with their honour, duty, oaths, and sub∣scriptions.</P>
<P>§ X. The commissioners, notwithstanding the secession,
proceeded to debate with moderation on the abuses of
which the dissenters had complained, and corrected every
article that seemed liable to any just objection; but the
opposite party employed all their art and industry to in∣flame
the minds of the people. The two universities
declared against all alterations, and those who promoted
them. The King himself was branded as an enemy to
the hierarchy; and they bestirred themselves so success∣fully
in the election of members for the convocation, that
they procured a very considerable majority. At their first
meeting, the friends of the comprehension scheme pro∣posed
Dr. Tillotson, clerk of the closet to his Majesty,
as prolocutor; but the other party carried it in favour of
Dr. Jane, who was counted the most violent churchman
in the whole assembly. In a Latin speech to the Bishop of
London as president, he, in the name of the Lower House,
asserted that the liturgy of England needed no amendment,
and concluded with the old declaration of the barons,
“<HI>Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.</HI> We will not suffer the
laws of England to be changed.” The Bishop, in his reply,
exhorted them to moderation, charity, and indulgence
towards their brethren, the dissenters, and to make such
abatements in things indifferent as might serve to open a
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
door of salvation to multitudes of straying christians. His
injunctions, however, produced no favourable effect. The
Lower House seemed to be animated by a spirit of opposi∣tion.
Next day the president prorogued them, on pretence
that the royal commission, by which they were to act,
was defective for want of being sealed, and that a proro∣gation
was necessary until that sanction should be ob∣tained.
In this interval means were used to mollify their
noncompliant tempers, but all endeavours proved inef∣fectual.
When they met again, the Earl of Nottingham
delivered the King's commission to both Houses, with a
speech of his own, and a message from his Majesty, im∣porting,
that he had summoned them out of a pious zeal
to do every thing that might tend to the best establishment
of the Church of England, which should always enjoy
his favour and protection. He exhorted them to lay aside
all prejudice, and consider calmly and impartially what∣ever
should be proposed: he assured them he would offer
nothing but what should be for the honour, peace, and
advantage, of the protestant religion in general, and par∣ticularly
of the Church of England.</P>
<P>§ XI. The bishops, adjourning to the Jerusalem-chamber,
prepared a zealous address of thanks to his
Majesty, which, being sent to the Lower House for their
concurrence, met with violent opposition. Amendments
were proposed; a conference ensued, and, after warm
debates, they agreed upon a cold address, which was ac∣cordingly
presented. The majority of the Lower House,
far from taking any measures in savour of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enters, con∣verted
all their attention to the relief of their nonjuring
brethren. Zealous speeches were made in behalf of the
suspended bishops; and Dr. Jane proposed that some∣thing
might be done to qualify them to sit in the convo∣cation.
This, however, was such a dangerous point as
they would not venture to discuss; yet, rather than pro∣ceed
upon the business for which they had been assembled,
they began to take cognizance of some pamphlets lately
published, which they conceived to be of dangerous
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
consequence to the christian religion. The President and
his party, perceiving the disposition of the House, did
not think proper to communicate any proposal touching
the intended reformation, and the King suffered the
session to be discontinued by repeated prorogations.</P>
<P>§ XII. The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day
of October, the King, in a speech of his own composing,
explained the necessity of a present supply to carry on the
war. He desired that they might be speedy in their de∣terminations
on this subject, for these would in a great
measure influence the deliberations of the princes and
states concerned in the war against France, as a general
meeting of them was appointed to be held next month at
the Hague, to settle the operations of the ensuing cam∣paign.
He concluded with recommending the dispatch of
a bill of indemnity, that the minds of his subjects might
be quieted, and that they might unanimously concur in
promoting the honour and welfare of the kingdom. As
several inflammatory bills and disputes, which had pro∣duced
heats and animosities in the last session, were still de∣pending,
the King, after having consulted both Houses,
resolved to put an end to those disputes by a prorogation.
He accordingly went to the House of Lords, and pro∣rogued
the parliament till the twenty-first day of October,
by the mouth of the new Speaker, Sir Robert Atkins, the
Marquis of Hallifax having resigned that office. When
they re-assembled, the King referred them to his former
speech: then the Commons unanimously resolved to assist his
Majesty in reducing Ireland, and in joining with his allies
abroad for a vigorous prosecution of the war against France:
for these purposes they voted a supply of two millions.</P>
<P>§ XIII. During this session the Whigs employed all
their influence and intrigues in obstructing the bill of
indemnity, which they knew would open a door for
favour and preferment to the opposite party, which began
to gain ground in the King's good graces. With this
view they revived the prosecution of the state prisoners.
A committee was appointed to prepare a charge against
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
Burton and Graham. The Commons resolved to im∣peach
the Earls of Peterborough, Salisbury, and Castle∣main,
Sir Edward Hales, and Obadiah Walker, of high
treason, for having been reconciled to the church of Rome,
contrary to the laws of the realm. A bill was ordered to
be brought in, to declare the estate of the late Lord Chan∣cellor
Jeffries forfeited to the crown, and attaint his
blood; but it met with such opposition that the measure
was dropped: the House however agreed, that the pecu∣niary
penalties incurred by those persons who had exer∣cised
offices contrary to the laws against popish recusants
should be speedily levied, and applied to the publick ser∣vice.
The Lord Griffin being detected in maintaining a
correspondence with King James, and his partisans, was
committed to the Tower: but, as no other evidence ap∣peared
against him than written letters, found in the false
bottom of a pewter bottle, they could not help consenting
to his being released upon bail, as they had lately resolved
that Algernon Sidney was unjustly condemned in the
reign of Charles II. because nothing but writings had been
produced against him at his trial. The two Houses con∣curred
in appointing a committee to enquire who were
the advisers and prosecutors in taking away the lives of
Lord Russel, Colonel Sidney, Sir Thomas Armstrong.
Alderman Cornish, and others; and who were chiefly
concerned in the arbitrary practices touching the writs of
<HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and the surrender of charters. This en∣quiry
was levelled at the Marquis of Hallifax, who had
concurred with the ministry of Charles in all these seve∣rities.
Though no proof appeared, upon which votes or
addresses could be founded, that nobleman saw it was ne∣cessary
for him to withdraw himself from the administra∣tion;
he, therefore, resigned the privy-seal, which was
put in commission, and reconciled himself to the Tories,
of whom he became the patron and protector.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The Commons likewise resumed the examina∣tion
of the miscarriages in Ireland, and desired the King
would appoint commissioners, to go over and enquire into
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
the condition of the army in that kingdom. Schomberg
understanding that he had been blamed in the House of
Commons for his inactivity, transmitted to the King a
satisfactory vindication of his own conduct; and it ap∣peared
that the miscarriages in Ireland were wholly ow∣ing
to John Shales, purveyor-general to the army. The
Commons immediately presented an address to his Ma∣jesty,
praying that Shales might be taken into custody;
that all his papers, accounts, and stores, should be secured;
and that Duke Schomberg might be empowered to fill
his place with a more able purveyor. The King gave
them to understand, that he had already sent orders to
the General for that purpose. Nevertheless, they in
another petition requested his Majesty to name those who
had recommended Shales to his service, as he had exer∣cised
the same office under King James, and was suspected
of treasonable practices against the government. William
declined gratifying their request; but he afterwards sent
a message to the House, desiring them to recommend a
certain number of commissioners to superinted such pro∣visions
and preparations as might be necessary for that
service, as well as to nominate certain persons to go over
and examine the state of the army in Ireland. The
Commons were so mollified by this instance of his con∣descension,
that they left the whole affair to his own di∣rection,
and proceeded to examine other branches of mis∣conduct.
Instances of mismanagement appeared so nu∣merous
and so flagrant, that they resolved upon a subse∣quent
address, to explain the ill conduct and success of
his army and navy; to desire he would find out the au∣thors
of these miscarriages, and for the future entrust
unsuspected persons with the management of affairs. They
ordered the victuallers of the fleet to be taken into custo∣dy,
on suspicion of their having furnished the navy with
unwholsome provisions, and new commissioners were ap∣pointed.
Bitter reproaches were thrown out against the
ministry. Mr. Hambden expressed his surprise that the
administration should consist of those very persons whom
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
King James had employed, when his affairs were despe∣rate,
to treat with the Prince of Orange, and moved that
the King should be petitioned in an address to remove
such persons from his presence and councils. This was a
stroke aimed at the Earl of Nottingham, whose office of
secretary Hambden desired to possess; but his motion
was not seconded, the court-members observing that
James did not depute those lords to the Prince of Orange
because they were attached to his own interest, but for a
very different reason, namely, that they were well known
to disapprove of his measures, and therefore would be
the more agreeable to his Highness. The House, howe∣ver,
voted an address to the King, desiring that the au∣thors
of the miscarriages might be brought to condign
punishment.</P>
<P>§ XV. In the sequel, the question was proposed, Whe∣ther
a placeman ought to have a seat in the House? and
a very warm debate ensued; but it was carried in the af∣firmative,
on the supposition that by such exclusion the
common-wealth would be deprived of some of the ablest
senators of the kingdom. But what chiefly irritated
William against the Whigs was their backwardness in
promoting the public service, and their disregard of the
earnest desire he expressed to see his revenue settled for
life. He said his title was no more than a pageant, and
the worst of all governments was that of a king without
treasure. Nevertheless they would not grant the civil
list for a longer term than one year. They began to
think there was something arbitrary in his disposition.
His sullen behaviour, in all probability, first infused this
opinion, which was strengthened and confirmed by the
insinuations of his enemies. The Scots, who had come
up to London to give an account of the proceedings in
their parliament, were infected with the same notion.
One Simpson, a presbyterian of that country, whom the
Earl of Portland employed as a spy, had insinuated him∣self
into the confidence of Nevil Payne, an active and
intelligent partisan and agent of King James; by which
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
means he supplied the earl with such intelligence as raised
him to some degree of credit with that minister. This he
used in prepossessing the Earl against the King's best
friends, and infusing jealousies which were soon kindled
into mutual distrust and animosity.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Sir James Montgomery, who had been a warm
advocate for the Revolution, received advice that the
court suspected him and others of disaffection, and was
employed in seeking evidence by which they might be
prosecuted. They were equally alarmed and incensed at
this intimation, and Payne seised the opportunity of sedu∣cing
them into a correspondence with the exiled King.
They demanded the settlement of presbytery in Scotland,
and actually engaged in a treaty for his restoration. They
reconciled themselves to the Duke of Queensberry, and
the other noblemen of the episcopal party: they wrote
to James for a supply of money, arms, and ammunition,
together with a re-enforcement of three thousand men
from Dunkirk. Montgomery had acquired great interest
among the Whigs of England, and this he employed in
animating them against the King and the ministry. He
represented them as a set of wicked men, who employed
infamous spies to ensnare and ruin the fast friends of the
government, and found means to alienate them so much
from William, that they began to think in earnest of re∣calling
their banished prince. The Duke of Bolton, and
the earl of Monmouth, were almost persuaded into a con∣spiracy
for this purpose; they seemed to think James
was now so well convinced of his former errors, that they
might trust him without scruple. Montgomery and
Payne were the chief managers of the scheme, and they
admitted Ferguson into their councils, as a veteran in the
arts of treason. In order to blast William's credit in the
city, they circulated a report that James would grant a
full indemnity, separate himself entirely from the French
interest, and be contented with a secret connivance in fa∣vour
of the roman catholics. Montgomery's brother as∣sured
the Bishop of Salisbury, that a treaty with King
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
James was absolutely concluded, and an invitation sub∣scribed
by the whole cabal. He said this paper would be
sent to Ireland by the way of France, as the direct com∣munication
was difficult; and he proposed a method for
seizing it before it should be conveyed out of the kingdom.
Williamson, the supposed bearer of it, had obtained a pass
for Flanders, and a messenger being sent in pursuit of him,
secured his clothes and pormanteau; but, after a very
very strict examination, nothing appeared to justify the
intelligence. Williamson had previously delivered the pa∣pers
to Simpson, who hired a boat at Deal, and arrived in
safety at France. He returned with large assurances, and
twelve thousand pounds were remitted to the Scottish un∣dertakers.
Montgomery, the informer, seeing his intelli∣gence
falsified, lost his credit with the Bishop, and dread∣ing
the resentment of the other party, retired to the conti∣nent.
The conspirators loudly complained of the false im∣putations
they had incurred. The pretended discoveries
were looked upon as fictions of the ministry, and the king
on this occasion suffered greatly in the opinion of his sub∣jects.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The Tories still continued to carry on a secret
negociation with the court. They took advantage of the
ill-humour subsisting between the King and the Whigs;
and promised large supplies of money, provided this par∣liament
should be dissolved, and another immediately con∣voked.
The opposite party, being apprised of their inten∣tion,
brought a bill into the House of Commons for resto∣ring
corporations to their antient rights and privileges.
They knew their own strength at elections consisted in
these corporations; and they inserted two additional se∣vere
clauses against those who were in any shape con∣cerned
in surrendering charters. The whole power of
the Tories was exerted against this clause; and now the
Whigs vied with them in making court to his Majesty,
promising to manifest the most submissive obedience should
this bill be enacted into a law. The strength of the To∣ries
was now become so formidable in the House, that they
outvoted the other party, and the clauses were rejected;
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bill passed in its original form. The Lords de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated
upon the point, Whether a corporation could be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rfeited or surrendered? Lord Chief Justice Holt and
two other Judges declared their opinion in the affirmative:
the rest thought otherwise, as no precedents could be pro∣duced
farther back than the reign of Henry VIII. when
the Abbies were surrendered; and this instance seemed too
violent to authorise such a measure in a regular course of
administration. The bill, however, passed by one voice
only. Then both parties quickened their applications to
the King, who found himself so perplexed and distracted
between two factions which he equally feared, that he
resolved to leave the government in the Queen's hands,
and retire to Holland. He communicated this design to
the Marquis of Caermarthen, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and
some other noblemen, who pressed him to lay aside his
resolution, and even mingled tears in their remonstrances.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. He at length complied with their request,
and determined to finish the Irish war in person. This
design was far from being agreeable to the parliament.
His friends dreaded the climate of that country, which
might prove fatal to his weak constitution. The well∣wishers
of James were afraid of that prince's being hard
pressed, should William take the field against him in per∣son:
both Houses, therefore, began to prepare an address
against this expedition. In order to prevent this remon∣strance,
the King went to the parliament, and formally
signified his resolution. After his speech they were pro∣rogued
to the second day of April. On the sixth day of
February they were dissolved by proclamation, and a new
parliament was summoned to meet on the twentieth day
of March. During this session, the Commons, in an
address to the King, desired that a revenue of fifty thou∣sand
pounds might be settled upon the Prince and Princess
of Denmark, out of the civil list; and his Majesty grati∣fied
them in this particular: yet, the warmth and in∣dustry
with which the friends of the Princess exerted
themselves in promoting the settlement produced a cold∣ness
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
and misunderstanding between the two sisters; and
the subsequent disgrace of the Earl of Marlborough was
imputed to the part which his wife acted on the occasion.
She was lady of the bed-chamber, and chief confident to
the Princess, whom she strenously advised to insist upon
the settlement, rather than depend upon the generosity of
the King and Queen.</P>
<P>§ XIX. About this period, General Ludlow, who at
the Restoration had been excepted from the act of indem∣nity,
as one of those who sat in judgment upon Charles I.
arrived in England, and offered his service in reducing
Ireland, where he had formerly commanded. Though a
rigid republican, he was reputed a conscientious man, and
a good officer. He had received some encouragement to
come over, and probably would have been employed, had
not the Commons interposed. Sir Edward Seymour,
who enjoyed by grant an estate in Wiltshire, which had
formerly belonged to Ludlow, began to be in pain for his
possession. He observed in the House, that the nation
would be disgraced, should one of the parricides be suf∣fered
to live in the kingdom. An address was immedi∣ately
presented to the King, desiring a proclamation might
be issued, promising a reward for apprehending General
Ludlow. This was accordingly published; but not before
he had landed in Holland, from whence he returned to
Vevay in Swisserland, where he wrote the memoirs of his
life, and died after an exile of thirty years.</P>
<P>§ XX. While King William fluctuated between two
parties in England, his interest in Scotland had well nigh
given way to a coalition between the original Jacobite<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Montgomery's party of discontented presbyterians
Colonel Cannon, who succeeded the Viscount Dundee i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
command, after having made several unsuccessful effort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in favour of the late King's interest, retired into Ireland
and the Higlanders chose Sir Hugh Cameron for their
leader. Under him they renewed their incursions wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the better prospect of success, as several regiments of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
regular troops had been sent to re-enforce the army o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
Schomberg. James assisted them with clothes, arms, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmunition, together with some officers, amongst whom
was Colonel Buchan, appointed to act as their chief com∣mander.
This officer, at the head of fifteen hundred men,
advanced into the shire of Murray, in hope of being joined
by other malcontents: but he was surprised and routed
by Sir Thomas Livingstone, while Major Ferguson de∣stroyed
the places they possessed in the Isle of Mull; so
that the Highlanders were obliged to retire, and conceal
themselves among their hills and fastnesses. The friends
of James, despairing of doing any thing effectual for his
service in the field, converted all their attention to the
proceedings in parliament, where they imagined their in∣terest
was much stronger than it appeared to be upon trial.
They took the oaths without hesitation, and hoped by the
assistance of their new allies, to embroil the government in
such a manner that the majority of the people would de∣clare
for a restoration. But the views of these new
cemented parties were altogether incompatible; and their
principles diametrically opposite. Notwithstanding their
concurrence in parliament, the Earl of Melvil procured a
small majority. The opposition was immediately dis∣couraged:
some individuals retracted, rather than fall
with a sinking cause; and mutual jealousies began to
prevail. The leaders of the coalition treated separately
with King James; made inconsistent demands; recipro∣cally
concealed their negociations: in a word, they
distrusted, and hated one another with the most impla∣cable
resentment.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The Earls of Argyle, Annandale, and Braidal∣bin
withdrew from their councils, and repaired to Eng∣land.
Montgomery, terrified at their defection, went
privately to London, after he had hinted something of the
plot to Melvil, and sollicited a pass from the Queen,
which was refused. Annandale, having received infor∣mation
that Montgomery had disclosed all the particulars
of the negociation, threw himself upon the Queen's mercy,
and discovered all he knew of the conspiracy. As he had
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
not treated with any of the malcontents in England
they remained secure from his evidence; but, he informe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
against Nevil Payne, who had been sent down as thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
agent to Scotland, where he now resided. He was imme¦diately
apprehended by the council of that kingdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
consequence of a letter from the Earl of Nottingham
and twice put to the torture, which he resolutely bor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
without discovering his employers. Montgomery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
absconded in London, solliciting a pardon; but, findin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he could not obtain it, except on condition of making
full discovery, he abandoned his country, and chose to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in exile, rather than betray his confederates. This di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
union of the conspirators, and discovery of the plot, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Earl of Melvil in possession of a greater majority
though even this he was fain to secure by overstrainin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his instructions in the articles of patronage, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>premacy of the crown, which he yielded up to the fury <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the fanatick presbyterians, contrary to the intention <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
King William. In lieu of these, however, they indulge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him with the tax of chimney or hearth-money; as we
as with a test to be imposed upon all persons in office an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
parliament, declaring William and Mary their law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
sovereigns, and renouncing the pretended title of Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
James. All the laws in favour of episcopacy were r∣pealed.
Threescore of the presbyterian ministers, wl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had been ejected at the Restoration, were still alive; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these the parliament declared the only sound part of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
church. The government of it was lodged in the
hands; and they were empowered to admit such as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
should think proper, to their assistance. A few furio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fanaticks being thus associated, proceeded with ungover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
able violence to persecute the episcopal party, exercisu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the very same tyranny against which they themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
so loudly exclaimed.</P>
<P>§ XXII. While the presbyterian interest thus
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>umphed in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1690.</NOTE> the two parties that divided En<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land
employed their whole influence and attention
managing the elections for a new parliament; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
Tories obtained the victory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1690.</NOTE> The King seemed gradually
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling into the arms of this party. They complained of
their having been totally excluded from the Lieutenancy
of London at the King's accession to the crown; and now
a considerable number of the most violent Tories in the
city were admitted into the commission by the interest and
address of the Bishop of London, the Marquis of Caer∣marthen,
and the Earl of Nottingham. To gratify that
party, the Earls of Monmouth and Warrington were dis∣missed
from their employments: nay, when the parliament
met on the twentieth day of March, the Commons chose
for their Speaker Sir John Trevor, a violent partisan of
that faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Belcarres. Kennet. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> who had been created Master of the Rolls by
the late King. He was a bold, artful man, and under∣took
to procure a majority to be at the devotion of the
court, provided he should be supplied with the necessary
sums for the purposes of corruption. William, finding
there was no other way of maintaining his administration
in peace, thought proper to countenance the practice of
purchasing votes, and appointed Trevor first commissioner
of the great seal. In his speech to the new parliament, he
gave them to understand, that he still persisted in his reso∣lution
of going in person to Ireland. He desired they
would make a settlement of the revenue, or establish it for
the present, as a fund of credit, upon which the neces∣sary
sums for the service of the government might be
immediately advanced: he signified his intention of send∣ing
to them an act of grace, with a few exceptions, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he might manifest his readiness to extend his protection to
all his subjects, and leave no colour of excuse for raising
disturbances in his absence, as he knew how busy some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll-affected men were in their endeavours to alter the esta∣blished
government: he recommended an union with
Scotland, the parliament of which had appointed com∣missioners
for that purpose: he told them he should leave
the administration in the hands of the Queen, and desired
they would prepare an act to confirm her authority: he
exhorted them to dispatch the business for which they
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
were assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1690.</NOTE> to avoid debates, and expressed his hope
that they should soon meet again, to finish what might be
now left imperfect.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The Commons, in compliance with his re∣quest,
voted a supply of twelve hundred thousand pounds,
one million of that sum to be raised by a clause of credit
in the revenue-bills; but he could not prevail upon them
to settle the revenue for life. They granted, however,
the hereditary excise for that term, but the customs for
four years only. They considered this short term as the
best security the kingdom could have for frequent parlia∣ments;
though this precaution was not at all agreeable to
their sovereign. A poll-bill was likewise passed; other
supplies were granted, and both parties seemed to court
his Majesty, by advancing money on those funds of credit.
The Whigs, however, had another battery in reserve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
They produced, in the Upper House, a bill for recog∣nizing
their Majesties as the rightful and lawful sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of these realms, and for declaring all the acts of the last
parliament to be good and valid. The Tories were now
reduced to a very perplexed situation. They could no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
oppose the bill without hazarding the interest they had s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lately acquired, nor assent to it without solemnly re∣nouncing
their former arguments and distinctions. They
made no great objections to the first part, and even pro¦posed
to enact, That those should be deemed good law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the time to come: but they refused to declare the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
valid for that which was past. After a long debate, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bill was committed; yet the Whigs lost their majority o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the report: nevertheless, the bill was recovered, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
passed with some alteration in the words, in consequenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a nervous, spirited protest, signed Bolton, Maccles field
Stamford, Newport, Bedford, Herbert, Suffolk, Mon
mouth, Delamere, and Oxford. The whole interest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the court was thrown into the scale with this bill, befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it would preponderate against the Tories, the chiefs o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whom, with the Earl of Nottingham at their head, pro¦tested
in their turn. The same party in the House o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
Commons were determined upon a vigorous opposition;
and in the mean time some trifling objections were made,
that it might be committed for amendment; but their
design was prematurely discovered by one of their faction,
who chanced to question the legality of the convention, as
it was not summoned by the King's writ. This insinua∣tion
was answered by Somers, the Solicitor-General, who
observed, that if it was not a legal parliament, they who
were then met, and who had taken the oaths enacted by
that parliament, were guilty of high-treason: the laws
repealed by it were still in force: it was their duty, there∣fore,
to return to King James; and all concerned in
collecting and paying the money levied by the acts of that
parliament were highly criminal. The Tories were so
struck with these arguments, that the bill passed without
further opposition, and immediately received the royal
assent. Thus the settlement was confirmed by those very
people who had so loudly exclaimed against it as illegal:
but the Whigs, with all their management, would not
have gained their point, had not the court been interested
in the dispute.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. There was another violent contest between
the two parties, on the import of a bill requiring all sub∣jects
in office to abjure King James, on pain of imprison∣ment.
Though the clergy were at first exempted from
this test, the main body of the Tories opposed it with
great vehemence; while the Whigs, under countenance
of the ministry, supported it with equal vigour. It pro∣duced
long and violent debates; and the two factions
seemed pretty equally balanced. At length, the Tories
represented to the King, that a great deal of precious
time would be lost in fruitless altercation: that those who
declared against the bill would grow sullen and intracta∣ble,
so as to oppose every other motion that might be
made for the King's service: that, in case of its being
carried, his Majesty must fall again into the hands of the
Whigs, who would renew their former practices against
the prerogative; and many individuals, who were now
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
either well affected to him, or at least neutral, would be∣come
Jacobites from resentment. These suggestions had
such weight with King William, that he sent an inti∣mation
to the Commons, desiring they would drop the
debate, and proceed to matters that were more pressing.
The Whigs in general were disgusted at this interposition;
and the Earl of Shrewsbury, who had interested himself
warmly in behalf of the bill, resented it so deeply, that he
insisted on resigning his office of Secretary of State. The
King, who revered his talents and integrity, employed
Dr. Tillotson and others, who were supposed to have
credit with the Earl, to dissuade him from quitting his
employment: but, he continued deaf to all their re∣monstrances,
and would not even comply with the request
of his Majesty, who pressed him to keep the seals until he
should return from Ireland. Long debates were likewise
managed in the House of Lords, upon the bill of abju∣ration,
or rather an oath of special fidelity to William, in
opposition to James. The Tories professed themselves
willing to enter into a negative engagement against the
late King and his adherents: but they opposed the oath
of abjuration with all their might; and the House was so
equally divided that neither side was willing to hazard a
decision: so that all the fruit of their debates was a pro∣longation
of the session.</P>
<P>§ XXV. An act was prepared for investing the Queen
with the administration during the King's absence; ano∣ther
for reversing the judgment on a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> against
the city of London, and restoring it to its ancient rights
and privileges; and at length, the bill of indemnity so cor∣dially
recommended by the King passed both Houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following person a were excepted from the benefit of this act.

On the twenty-first day of May, the King closed the
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
session with a short speech, in which he thanked them
for the supplies they had granted; and recommended to
them a punctual discharge of their duties in their respec∣tive
counties, that the peace of the nation might not be
interrupted in his absence. The Houses were adjourned
to the seventh day of July; when the parliament was pro∣rogued
and adjourned successively. As a further security
for the peace of the kingdom, the deputy-lieutenants were
authorised to raise the militia in case of necessity. All
papists were prohibited to stir above five miles from their
respective places of abode: a proclamation was published
for apprehending certain disaffected persons: Sir John
Cochran and Ferguson were actually arrested, on suspicion
of treasonable practices. On the fourth day of June the
King set out for Ireland, attended by Prince George of
Denmark, the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Oxford,
Scarborough, Manchester, and many other persons of
distinction: on the fourteenth day of the month he landed
at Carrickfergus, from whence he immediately proceeded
to Belfast, where he was met by the Duke of Schomberg,
the Prince of Wirtemberg, Major-General Kirke, and
other officers. By this time, Col. Wolsey, at the head
of a thousand men, had defeated a strong detachment of
the enemy near Belturbat: Sir John Lanier had taken
Bedloe-castle; and that of Charlemont, a strong post of
great importance, together with Balingargy, near Cavan,
had been reduced. King William having reposed himself
for two or three days at Belfast, visited the Duke's head∣quarters
at Lisburne: then advancing to Hillsborough,
published an order against pressing horses, and commit∣ting
violence on the country people. When some of his
general officers proposed cautious measures, he declared
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he did not come to Ireland to let the grass grow under his
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
feet. He ordered the army to encamp and be reviewed
at Loughbrilland, where he found it amount to six-and-thirty
thousand effective men well appointed. Then he
marched to Dundalk; and afterwards advanced to Ar∣dee,
which the enemy had just abandoned.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. King James trusted so much to the disputes
in the English parliament, that he did not believe his son-in-law
would be able to quit that kingdom; and William
had been six days in Ireland before he received intimation
of his arrival. This was no sooner known, than he left
Dublin under the guard of the militia commanded by
Luttrell, and with a re-enforcement of six-thousand in∣fantry,
which he had lately received from France, joined
the rest of his forces, which now almost equalled Wil∣liam's
army in number, exclusive of about fifteen thou∣sand
men who remained in different garrisons. He occu∣pied
a very advantageous post on the bank of the Boyne,
and, contrary to the advice of his general officers, resolved
to stand battle. They proposed to strengthen their garri∣sons,
and retire to the Shannon, to wait the effect of the
operations at sea. Louis had promised to equip a powerful
armament against the English fleet, and send over a great
number of small frigates to destroy William's transports,
as soon as their convoy should be returned to England.
The execution of this scheme was not at all difficult, and
must have proved fatal to the English army; for their
stores and ammunition were still on board; the ships
sailed along the coast as the troops advanced in their
march; and there was not one secure harbour into which
they could retire on any emergency. James, however,
was bent upon hazarding an engagement; and expressed
uncommon confidence and alacrity. Besides the river,
which was deep, his front was secured by a morass and
a rising ground: so that the English army could not at∣tack
him without manifest disadvantage.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. King William marched up to the opposite
bank of the river, and, as he reconnoitred their situation,
was exposed to the sire of some field-pieces, which the
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
enemy purposely planted against his person. They killed
a man and two horses close by him; and the second bul∣let
rebounding from the earth, grazed upon his right
shoulder, so as to carry off part of his clothes and skin,
and produce a considerable contusion. This accident,
which he bore without the least emotion, created some
confusion among his attendants, which the enemy per∣ceiving,
concluded he was killed, and shouted aloud in
token of their joy. Their whole camp resounded with
acclamation; and several squadrons of their horse were
drawn down towards the river, as if they had intended to
pass it immediately, and attack the English army. The
report was instantly communicated from place to place,
until it reached Dublin; from thence it was conveyed to
Paris, where, contrary to the custom of the French court,
the people were encouraged to celebrate the event with
bonfires and illuminations. William rode along the line
to shew himself to the army after this narrow escape. At
night he called a council of war; and declared his reso∣lution
to attack the enemy in the morning. Schomberg
at first opposed this design: but finding the King deter∣mined,
he advised that a strong detachment of horse and
foot should that night pass the Boyne at Slane-bridge, and
take post between the enemy and the pass of Duleck, that
the action might be the more decisive. This counsel
being rejected, the King determined, that, early in the
morning, Lieutenant-General Douglas, with the right
wing of infantry, and young Schomberg, with the horse,
should pass at Slane-bridge, while the main body of foot
should force their passage at Old-bridge, and the left at
certain fords between the enemy's camp and Drogheda.
The Duke, perceiving his advice was not relished by the
Dutch Generals, retired to his tent, where the order of
battle being brought to him, he received it with an air of
discontent, saying, it was the first that had ever been sent
him in that manner. The proper dispositions being made,
William rode quite thro' the army by torch-light, and then
retired to his tent, after having given orders for the soldiers
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
to distinguish themselves from the enemy by wearing
green boughs in their hats during the action.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. At six o'clock in the morning, General
Douglas, with young Schomberg, the Earl of Portland, and
Auverquerque, marched towards Slane-bridge, and passed
the river with very little opposition. When they reached
the farther bank, they perceived the enemy drawn up in
two lines, to a considerable number of horse and foot,
with a morass in their front; so that Douglas was obliged
to wait for a re-enforcement. This being arrived, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
infantry were led on to the charge through the morass
while Count Schomberg rode round it with his cavalry
to attack the enemy in flank. The Irish, instead of wait¦ing
the assault, faced about, and retreated towards Dulec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with some precipitation; yet not so fast, but that Schom¦berg
fell in among their rear, and did considerable exe¦cution.
King James, however, soon re-enforced his le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
wing from the centre; and the Count was in his tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
obliged to send for assistance. At this juncture, Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
William's main-body, consisting of the Dutch-guards, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
French regiments, and some battalions of English, passe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the river, which was waist high, under a general discharg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of artillery. King James had imprudently removed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cannon from the other side; but he had posted a stron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
body of musqueteers along the bank, behind hedge
houses, and some works raised for the occasion. The
poured in a close fire upon the English troops before th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
reached the shore; but it produced very little effect: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Irish gave way; and some battalions landed witho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
further opposition. Yet, before they could form, they we
charged with great impetuosity by a squadron of the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my's
horse; and a considerable body of their cavalry <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
foot, commanded by General Hamilton, advanced fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
behind some little hillocks, to attack those that we
landed, as well as to prevent the rest from reaching <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
shore. His infantry turned their backs and sled
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mediately; but, the horse charged with incredible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
both upon the bank and in the river, so as to put <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
unformed regiments in confusion. Then the Duke of
Schomberg passing the river in person, put himself at the
head of the French protestants, and pointing to the enemy,
“Gentlemen (said he) those are your persecutors;” with
these words he advanced to the attack, where he himself
sustained a violent onset from a party of the Irish horse,
which had broke through one of the regiments, and were
now on their return. They were mistaken for English,
and allowed to gallop up to the Duke, who received two
severe wounds in the head: but the French regiments
being now sensible of their mistake, rashly threw in their
fire upon the Irish while they were engaged with the
Duke; and, instead of saving, shot him dead upon the spot.
The fate of this general had well nigh proved fatal to the
English army, which was immediately involved in tumult
and disorder; while the infantry of King James rallied,
and returned to their posts with the face of resolution.
They were just ready to fall upon the centre, when King
William having passed with the left wing, composed of
the Danish, Dutch, and Inniskillin horse, advanced to
attack them on the right. They were struck with such a
panick at his appearance, that they made a sudden halt,
and then facing about, retreated to the village of Dunore.
There they made such a vigorous stand, that the Dutch
and Danish horse, though headed by the King in person,
recoiled; even the Inniskilliners gave way; and the whole
wing would have been routed, had not a detachment of
dragoons, belonging to the regiments of Cunningham and
Levison, dismounted, and lined the hedges on each side of
the defile through which the fugitives were driven. There
they did such execution upon the pursuers, as soon
checked their ardour. The horse, which were broken,
had now time to rally, and, returning to the charge, drove
the enemy before them in their turn. In this action Gene∣ral
Hamilton, who had been the life and soul of the Irish
during the whole engagement, was wounded and taken;
an incident which discouraged them to such a degree, that
they made no further efforts to retrieve the advantage they
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
had lost. He was immediately brought to the King, who
asked him if he thought the Irish would make any further
resistance? and he replied, “Upon my honour, I believe
they will; for they have still a good body of horse entire.”
William, eying him with a look of disdain, repeated
“Your honour! your honour!” but took no other
notice of his having acted contrary to his engagement,
when he was permitted to go to Ireland, on promise of
persuading Tyrconnel to submit to the new government.
The Irish now abandoned the field with precipitation;
but the French and Swiss troops, that acted as their
auxiliaries, under Lauzun, retreated in good order, after
having maintained the battle for some time with intre∣pidity
and perseverance.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. As King William did not think proper to
pursue the enemy the carnage was not great. The Irish
lost fifteen hundred men, and the English about one third
of that number; though the victory was dearly purchased,
considering the death of the gallant Duke of Schomberg,
who fell in the eighty-second year of his age, after having
rivalled the best generals of the time in military reputation.
He was descended of a noble family in the Palatinate, and
his mother was an English woman, daughter of Lord
Dudley. Being obliged to leave his country on account
of the troubles by which it was agitated, he commenced a
soldier of fortune, and served successively in the armies of
Holland, England, France, Portugal, and Brandenburgh.
He attained to the dignities of mareschal in France,
grandee in Portugal, generalissimo in Prussia, and duke
in England. He professed the protestant religion; was
courteous and humble in his deportment; cool, pene∣trating,
resolute, and sagacious; nor was his probity
inferior to his courage. This battle likewise proved fatal
to the brave Caillemote, who had followed the Duke's
fortunes, and commanded one of the protestant regiments.
After having received a mortal wound, he was carried
back through the river by four soldiers, and though almost
in the agonies of death, he with a chearful countenance
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
encouraged those who were crossing to do their duty,
exclaiming, “<HI>A la gloire, mes enfans; à la gloire!</HI> To
glory, my lads; to glory!” The third remarkable person
who lost his life on this occasion, was Walker the clergy∣man,
who had so valiantly defended Londonderry against
the whole army of King James. He had been very gra∣ciously
received by King William, who gratified him with
a reward of five thousand pounds, and a promise of further
favour; but, his military genius still predominating, he
attended his royal patron in this battle, and, being shot
in the belly, died in a few minutes. The persons of
distinction who fell on the other side were the Lords
Dongan and Carlingford, Sir Neile O Neile, and the
Marquis of Hocquincourt. James himself stood aloof
during the action, on the hill of Dunmore, surrounded
with some squadrons of horse; and seeing victory declare
against him, retired to Dublin, without having made the
least effort to re-assemble his broken forces. Had he
possessed either spirit or conduct, his army might have
been rallied, and re-enforced from his garrisons, so as to
be in a condition to keep the field, and even act upon the
offensive; for his loss was inconsiderable, and the victor
did not attempt to molest his troops in their retreat—an
omission which has been charged upon him as a flagrant
instance of misconduct. Indeed, through the whole of
this engagement, William's personal courage was much
more conspicuous than his military skill.</P>
<P>§ XXX. King James no sooner arrived at Dublin,
than he assembled the magistrates and council of the city,
and in a short speech resigned them to the fortune of the
victor. He complained of the cowardice of the Irish;
signified his resolution of leaving the kingdom imme∣diately;
forbad them, on their allegiance, to burn or
plunder the city after his departure; and assured them,
that, though he was obliged to yield to force, he would
never cease to labour for their deliverance. Next day he
set out for Waterford, attended by the Duke of Berwick,
Tyrconnel, and the Marquis of Powis. He ordered all
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
the bridges to be broken down behind him, and embarked
in a vessel which had been prepared for his reception. At
sea he fell in with the French squadron, commanded by
the Sieur de Foran, who persuaded him to go on board
one of his frigates, which was a prime sailor. In this he
was safely conveyed to France, and returned to the place
of his former residence at St. Germain's. He had no
sooner quitted Dublin, than it was also abandoned by
all the papists. The protestants immediately took pos∣session
of the arms belonging to the militia, under the
conduct of the Bishops of Meath and Limerick. A com∣mittee
was formed to take charge of the administration;
and an account of these transactions was transmitted to
King William, together with a petition, that he would
honour the city with his presence.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. On the morning after the battle of the Boyne,
William sent a detachment of horse and foot, under the
command of M. Mellionere, to Drogheda, the governor
of which surrendered the place without opposition. The
King, at the head of the army, began his march for
Dublin, and halted the first night at Bally-Breghan,
where, having received advice of the enemy's retreat from
the capital, he sent the Duke of Ormond, with a body
of horse, to take possession. These were immediately
followed by the Dutch guards, who secured the castle. In
a few days the King encamped at Finglas, in the neigh∣bourhood
of Dublin, where he was visited by the Bishops
of Meath and Limerick, at the head of the protestant
clergy, whom he assured of his favour and protection.
Then he published a declaration of pardon to all the
common people who had served against him, provided they
should return to their dwellings, and surrender their arms
by the first day of August. Those that rented lands of
popish proprietors who had been concerned in the rebel∣lion
were required to retain their rents in their own hands,
until they should have notice from the commissioners of
the revenue to whom they should be paid. The desperate
leaders of the rebellion, who had violated the laws of the
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
kingdom, called in the French, authorised the depreda∣tions
which had been committed upon protestants, and
rejected the pardon offered to them on the King's first pro∣clamation,
were left to the event of war, unless by evident
demonstrations of repentance they should deserve mercy,
which would never be refused to those who were truely
penitent. The next step taken by King William was to
issue a proclamation, reducing the brass money to nearly
its intrinsick value. In the mean time, the principal
officers in the army of James, after having seen him em∣bark
at Waterford, returned to their troops, determined
to prosecute the war as long as they could be supplied with
means to support their operations.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. During these transactions, the Queen, as
regent, found herself surrounded with numberless cares
and perplexities. Her council was pretty equally divided
into Whigs and Tories, who did not always act with una∣nimity.
She was distracted between her apprehensions
for her father's safety and her husband's life: she was
threatened with an invasion by the French from abroad,
and with an insurrection by the Jacobites at home. Never∣theless,
she disguised her fears, and behaved with equal
prudence and fortitude. Advice being received that a fleet
was ready to sail from Brest, Lord Torrington hoisted his
flag in the Downs, and sailed round to St. Helen's, in
order to assemble such a number of ships as would enable
him to give them battle. The enemy being discovered
off Plymouth, on the twentieth day of June, the English
Admiral, re-enforced with a Dutch squadron, stood out
to sea, with a view to intercept them at the back of the
Isle of Wight, should they presume to sail up the channel:
not that he thought himself strong enough to cope with
them in battle. Their fleet consisted of seventy-eight ships
of war, and two-and-twenty fireships; whereas, the com∣bined
squadrons of England and Holland did not exceed
six-and-fifty; but he had received orders to hazard an
engagement, if he thought it might be done with any
prospect of success. After the hostile fleets had continued
five days in sight of each other, Lord Torrington bore
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
down upon the enemy off Beachy-head, on the thirtieth
day of June, at day-break. The Dutch squadron, which
composed the van, began the engagement about nine in
the morning: in about half an hour the blue division of
the English were close engaged with the rear of the French;
but the red, which formed the centre, under the command
of Torrington in person, did not fill the line till ten
o'clock, so that the Dutch were almost surrounded by the
enemy, and, though they fought with great valour, su∣stained
considerable damage. At length, the Admiral's
division drove between them and the French, and in that
situation the fleet anchored about five in the afternoon,
when the action was interrupted by a calm. The Dutch
had suffered so severely, that Torrington thought it would
be imprudent to renew the battle; he, therefore, weighed
anchor in the night, and with the tide of flood retired to
the eastward. The next day the disabled ships were de∣stroyed,
that they might not be retarded in their retreat.
They were pursued as far as Rye: an English ship of
seventy guns being stranded near Winchelsea, was set on
fire, and deserted, by the captain's command. A Dutch
ship of sixty-four guns met with the same accident, and
some French frigates attempted to burn her; but the
captain defended her so vigorously that they were obliged
to desist, and he afterwards found means to carry her safe
to Holland. In this engagement the English lost two
ships, two sea-captains, and about four hundred men;
but the Dutch were more unfortunate. Six of their great
ships were destroyed; Dick and Brackel, rear admirals,
were slain, together with a great number of inferior officers
and seamen. Torrington retreated without further inter∣ruption
into the mouth of the Thames, and, having taker
precautions against any attempts of the enemy in that
quarter, returned to London, the inhabitants of whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were overwhelmed with consternation.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The government was infected with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
same panick. The ministry pretended to believe that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
French acted in concert with the malcontents of the nation
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
that insurrections in different parts of the kingdom had
been projected by the Jacobites; and that there would be
general revolt in Scotland. These insinuations were
circulated by the court-agents, in order to justify, in the
opinion of the publick, the measures that were deemed
necessary at this juncture; and they produced the desired
effect. The apprehensions thus artfully raised among the
people inflamed their aversion to nonjurors and Jacobites.
Addresses were presented to the Queen by the Cornish
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inners, by the lieutenancy of Middlesex, and by the
Mayor, Aldermen, and Lieutenancy of London, filled
with professions of loyalty, and promises of supporting
their Majesties, as their lawful sovereigns, against all
opposition. The Queen, at this crisis, exhibited remark∣able
proofs of courage, activity, and discretion. She issued
out proper orders and directions for putting the nation in a
posture of defence, as well as for refitting and augmenting
the fleet: she took measures for appeasing the resent∣ment
of the States-General, who exclaimed against the
Earl of Torrington for his behaviour in the late action.
He was deprived of his command, and sent prisoner to the
Tower: and commissioners were appointed, to examine
the particular circumstances of his conduct. A camp was
formed in the neighbourhood of Torbay, where the French
seemed to threaten a descent. Their fleet, which lay at
anchor in the bay, cannonaded a small village called
Tingmouth. About a thousand of their men landed
without opposition, set fire to the place, and burned a few
coasting vessels: then they re-embarked, and returned to
Brest, so vain of this atchievement, that they printed a
pompous account of their invasion. Some of the Whig
partisans published pamphlets, and diffused reports, im∣plying,
that the suspended bishops were concerned in the
conspiracy against the government; and these arts proved
so inflammatory among the common people, that the pre∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes
thought it necessary to print a paper, in which they
asserted their innocence in the most solemn protestations.
The court seems to have harboured no suspicion against
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
them, otherwise they would not have escaped imprison∣ment.
The Queen issued a proclamation for apprehend∣ing
the Earls of Lichfield, Aylesbury, and Castlemain;
Viscount Preston; the Lords Montgomery and Bellasis;
Sir Edward Hales, Sir Robert Tharold, Sir Robert Ha∣milton,
Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, Colonel Edward
Sackville, and some other officers. These were accused
of having conspired with other disaffected persons to disturb
and destroy the government, and of a design to concur
with her Majesty's enemies in the intended invasion. The
Earl of Torrington continued a prisoner in the Tower till
next session, when he was brought into the House of
Commons, and made a speech in his own defence. His
case produced long debates in the Upper House, where
the form of his commitment was judged illegal: at length
he was tried by a court-martial, appointed by the com∣missioners
of the Admiralty, though not before an act had
passed, declaring the power of a lord high-admiral vested
in those commissioners. The president of the court was
Sir Ralph Delaval, who had acted as vice-admiral of the
blue in the engagement. The Earl was acquitted, but
the King dismissed him from the service; and the Dutch
exclaimed against the partiality of his judges.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. William is said to have intercepted all the
papers of his father-in-law and Tyrconnel, and to have
learned from them, not only the design projected by the
French to burn the English transports, but likewise the
undertaking of one Jones, who engaged to assassinate King
William. No such attempt, however, was made, and,
in all probabilty, the whole report was a fiction, calcu∣lated
to throw an odium on James's character. On the
ninth day of July William detached General Douglas
with a considerable body of horse and foot towards
Athlone, while he himself, having left Trelawny to com∣mand
at Dublin, advanced with the rest of his army to
Inchiquin, in his way to Kilkenny. Colonel Grace, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
governor of Athlone for King James, being summoned to
surrender, fired a pistol at the trumpeter, saying, “Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
are my terms.” Then Douglas resolved to undertake
the siege of the place, which was naturally very strong,
and defended by a resolute garrison. An inconsiderable
breach was made, when Douglas, receiving intelligence
that Sarsfield was on his march to the relief of the be∣sieged,
abandoned the enterprise, after having lost above
four hundred men in the attempt. The King continued
his march to the westward; and, by dint of severe exam∣ples,
established such order and discipline in his army,
that the peasants were secure from the least violence. At
Carlow he detached the Duke of Ormond to take posses∣sion
of Kilkenny, where that nobleman regaled him in
his own castle, which the enemy had left undamaged.
While the army encamped at Carrick, Major-General
Kirke was sent to Waterford, the garrison of which,
consisting of two regiments, capitulated, upon condition
of marching out with their arms and baggage, and being
conducted to Mallow. The fort of Duncannon was
surrendered on the same terms. Here the Lord Dover and
the Lord George Howard were admitted to the benefit of
the King's mercy and protection.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. On the first day of August, William being
at Chapel-Izard, published a second declaration of mercy,
confirming the former, and even extending it to persons of
superior rank and station, whether natives or foreigners,
provided they would, by the twenty-fifth day of the
month, lay down their arms, and submit to certain con∣ditions.
This offer of indemnity produced very little
effect; for the Irish were generally governed by their
priests, and the news of the victory which the French
fleet had obtained over the English and Dutch was
circulated with such exaggerations as elevated their spirits,
and effaced all thoughts of submission. The King had
returned to Dublin, with a view to embark for England;
but receiving notice that the designs of his domestick ene∣mies
were discovered and frustrated; that the fleet was
repaired, and the French navy retired to Brest, he post∣poned
his voyage, and resolved to reduce Limerick, in
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
which Monsieur Boisseleau commanded as governor, and
the Duke of Berwick and Colonel Sarsfield acted as in∣ferior
officers. On the ninth day of August, the King
having called in his detachments, and advanced into the
neighbourhood of the place, summoned the commander
to deliver the town; and Boisseleau answered, that he
imagined the best way to gain the good opinion of the
Prince of Orange would be a vigorous defence of the
town which his Majesty had committed to his charge.
Before the place was fully invested, Colonel Sarsfield,
with a body of horse and dragoons, passed the Shannon
in the night, intercepted the King's train of artillery on
its way to the camp, routed the troops that guarded it,
disabled the cannon, destroyed the carriages, waggons,
and ammunition, and returned in safety to Limerick.
Notwithstanding this disaster, the trenches were opened
on the seventeenth day of the month, and a battery was
raised with some cannon brought from Waterford. The
siege was carried on with vigour, and the place defended
with great resolution. At length, the King ordered his
troops to make a lodgement in the covered way or coun∣terscarp,
which was accordingly assaulted with great fury:
but the assailants met with such a warm reception from
the besieged, that they were repulsed with the loss of
twelve hundred men, either killed on the spot or mortally
wounded. This disappointment concurring with the
badness of the weather, which became rainy and unwhole∣some,
induced the King to renounce his undertaking.
The heavy baggage and cannon being sent away, the
army decamped, and marched towards Clonmel. William
having constituted the Lord Sidney and Thomas Co∣ningsby
lords justices of Ireland, and left the command
of the army with Count Solmes, embarked at Duncannon
with Prince George of Denmark, on the fifth of Septem∣ber,
and next day arrived in King-Road, near Bristol,
from whence he repaired to Windsor.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. About the latter end of this month the
Earl of Marlborough arrived in Ireland, with five thousand
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
English troops, to attack Cork and Kinsale, in conjunc∣tion
with a detachment from the great army, according
to a scheme he had proposed to King William. Having
landed his soldiers without much opposition in the neigh∣bourhood
of Cork, he was joined by five thousand men,
under the Prince of Wirtemberg, between whom and the
Earl a dispute arose about the command; but this was
compromised by the interposition of La Mellionere. The
place being invested, and the batteries raised, the be∣siegers
proceeded with such rapidity that a breach was
soon effected. Colonel Mackillicut, the governor, de∣manded
a parley, and hostages were exchanged; but he
rejected the conditions that were offered, and hostilities
recommenced with redoubled vigour. The Duke of
Grafton, who served on this occasion as a volunteer, was
mortally wounded in one of the attacks, and died regretted
as a youth of promising talents. Preparations being made
for a general assault, the besieged thought proper to capi∣tulate,
and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Be∣sides
the Governor and Colonel Ricaut, the victor found
the Earls of Clancarty and Tyrone among the individuals
of the garrison. Marlborough having taken possession of
Cork, detached Brigadier Villiers with a body of horse
and dragoons to summon the town and forts of Kinsale,
and next day advanced with the rest of the forces. The
old fort was immediately taken by assault; but Sir Edward
Scot, who commanded the other, sustained a regular
siege, until the breach was practicable, and then obtained
an honourable capitulation. These maritime places being
reduced, all communication between France and the
enemy, on this side of the island, was cut off, and the
Irish were confined to Ulster, where they could not subsist
without great difficulty. The Earl of Marlborough hav∣ing
finished this expedition in thirty days, returned with
his prisoners to England, where the fame of this exploit
added greatly to his reputation.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. During these transactions, Count de
Lauzun, commander of the French auxiliaries in Ireland,
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
lay inactive in the neighbourhood of Galway, and trans∣mitted
such a lamentable account of his situation to the
court of France, that transports were sent over, to bring
home the French forces. In these he embarked with his
troops, and the command of the Irish forces devolved to
the Duke of Berwick, though it was afterwards trans∣ferred
to M. St. Ruth. Lauzun was disgraced at Ver∣sailles
for having deserted the cause before it was desperate:
Tyrconnel, who accompanied him in his voyage, solli∣cited
the French court for a further supply of officers,
arms, clothes, and ammunition for the Irish army, which
he said would continue firm to the interest of King James,
if thus supported. Mean while, they formed themselves
into separate bodies of freebooters, and plundered the
country, under the appellation of Rapparies; while the
troops of King William either enjoyed their ease in
quarters, or imitated the rapine of the enemy; so that,
between both, the poor people were miserably harrassed.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The affairs of the continent had not yet
undergone any change of importance, except in the
conduct of the Duke of Savoy, who renounced his neu∣trality,
engaged in an alliance with the emperor and
King of Spain; and, in a word, acceded to the grand
confederacy. He had no sooner declared himself than
Catinat, the French general, entered his territories, at
the head of eighteen thousand men, and defeated him in a
pitched battle near Saluces, which immediately surren∣dered
to the conqueror. Then he reduced Savillana
Villa Franca, with several other places, pursued the
Duke to Carignan, surprised Suza, and distributed his
forces in winter-quarters, partly in Provence, and partly
in the duchy of Savoy, which St. Ruth had lately re∣duced
under the dominion of France. The Duke finding
himself disappointed in the succours he expected from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Emperor and King of Spain, demanded assistance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
States-General and King William; to this last he sent a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ambassador, to congratulate him upon his accession to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
throne of England. The confederates, in their genera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
congress at the Hague, had agreed that the army of the
states under Prince Waldeck should oppose the forces of
France, commanded by the Duke of Luxembourg in
Flanders; while the elector of Brandenburgh should ob∣serve
the Marquis de Boufflers on the Moselle: but, be∣fore
the troops of Brandenburgh could be assembled,
Boufflers encamped between the Sambre and the Meuse,
and maintained a free communication with Luxembourg.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. Prince Waldeck understanding that this
general intended to cross the Sambre between Namur and
Charleroy, in order to lay the Spanish territories under
contribution, decamped from the river Pieton, and de∣tached
the Count of Berlo, with a great body of horse,
to observe the motions of the enemy. He was encountered
by the French army near Fleurus, and slain; and his
troops, though supported by two other detachments, were
hardly able to rejoin the main body, which continued all
night in order of battle. Next day they were attacked by
the French, who were greatly superior to them in num∣ber:
after a very obstinate engagement the allies gave way,
leaving about five thousand men dead upon the field of
battle. The enemy took about four thousand prisoners,
and the greatest part of their artillery; but the victory was
dearly bought. The Dutch infantry fought with surprising
resolution and success. The Duke of Luxembourg owned,
with surprise, that they had surpassed the Spanish foot at
the battle of Rocroy. “Prince Waldeck (said he) ought
always to remember the French horse; and I shall ne∣ver
forget the Dutch infantry.” The Dutch general
exerted himself with such activity, that the French de∣rived
very little advantage from their victory. The Prince
being re-enforced with the five English regiments, nine
thousand Hanoverians, ten thousand from the bishoprick
of Leige and Holland, joined the Elector of Branden∣burgh:
so that the confederate army amounted to five-and-fifty
thousand men, and they marched by the way of
Genap to Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. They were now superior
to Luxembourg, who thought proper to fortify his camp,
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
that he might not be obliged to fight, except with consi∣derable
advantage. Nevertheless, Prince Waldeck would
have attacked him in his entrenchments, had not he been
prohibited from hazarding another engagement, by an
express order of the States-General; and, when this re∣striction
was removed, the Elector would not venture a
battle.</P>
<P>§ XL. By this time the Emperor's son Joseph was by
the electoral college chosen King of the Romans; but his
interest sustained a rude shock in the death of the gallant
Duke of Lorraine, who was suddenly seised with a quinsey,
at a small village near Lintz, and expired, not without
suspicion of having fallen a sacrifice to the fears of the
French King, against whom he had formerly declared
war, as a sovereign prince unjustly expelled from his ter∣ritories.
He possessed great military talents, and had
threatened to enter Lorraine, at the head of forty thou∣sand
men, in the course of the ensuing summer. The
court of France, alarmed at this declaration, is said to have
had recourse to poison, for preventing the execution
of the Duke's design. At his death the command of the
Imperial army was conferred upon the Elector of Bavaria.
This prince, having joined the Elector of Saxony, ad∣vanced
against the Dauphin, who had passed the Rhine
at Fort Louis, with a considerable army, and intended to
penetrate into Wirtemberg; but the Duke of Bavaria
checked his progress, and he acted on the defensive du∣ring
the remaining part of the campaign. The Emperor
was less fortunate in his effors against the Turks, who
rejected the conditions of peace he had offered, and took
the field, under a new Visir. In the month of August
Count Tekeli defeated a body of Imperialists near Cronstadt,
in Transylvania; then convoking the states of that province
at Albajulia, he compelled them to elect him their sove∣reign;
but his reign was of short duration. Prince Louis,
of Baden, having taken the command of the Austrian
army, detached four regiments into Belgrade, and ad∣vanced
against Tekeli, who retired into Valachia at his
approach. Meanwhile, the Grand Visir invested Belgrade,
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
and carried on his attacks with surprising resolution. At
length, a bomb falling upon a great tower, in which the
powder magazine of the besieged was contained, the place
blew up with a dreadful explosion. Seventeen hundred
soldiers of the garrison were destroyed; the walls and
ramparts were overthrown; the ditch was filled up, and
so large a breach was opened, that the Turks entered by
squadrons and battalions, cutting in pieces all that fell in
their way. The fire spread from magazine to magazine
until eleven were destroyed; and, in the confusion, the
remaining part of the garrison escaped to Peterwaradin.
By this time the Imperialists were in possession of Tran∣sylvania,
and cantoned at Cronstadt and Clausinburgh.
Tekeli undertook to attack the province on one side,
while a body of Turks should invade it on the other:
these last were totally dispersed by Prince Louis, of Ba∣den;
but Prince Augustus, of Hanover, whom he had de∣tached
against the Count, was slain in a narrow defile, and
his troops were obliged to retreat with precipitation. Te∣keli,
however, did not improve this advantage. Being
apprised of the fate of his allies, and afraid of seeing his
retreat cut off by the snow, that frequently choaks up
the passes of the mountains, he retreated again to Vala∣chia,
and Prince Louis returned to Vienna.</P>
<P>§ XLI. King William having published a proclamation,
requiring the attendance of the members on the second
day of October, both Houses met accordingly, and he
opened the session with a speech to the usual purport.
He mentioned what he had done towards the reduction
of Ireland; commended the behaviour of the troops;
told them the supplies were not equal to the necessary
expense; represented the danger to which the nation
would be exposed, unless the war should be prosecuted
with vigour; conjured them to clear his revenue, which
was mortgaged for the payment of some debts, and ena∣ble
him to pay off the arrears of the army; assured them
that the success of the confederacy abroad would depend
upon the vigour and dispatch of their proceedings; ex∣pressed
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>
his resentment against those who had been guilty
of misconduct in the management of the fleet; recom∣mended
unanimity and expedition; and declared, that
whoever should attempt to divert their attention from
those subjects of importance which he had proposed, could
neither be a friend to him, nor a well-wisher to his coun∣try.
The late attempt upon the French upon the coast
of England, the rumours of a conspiracy by the Jacobites,
the personal valour which William had displayed in Ire∣land,
and the pusillanimous behaviour of James, con∣curred
in warming the resentment of the nation against
the adherents of the late King, and in raising a tide of
loyalty in favour of the new government. Both Hou∣ses
presented separate addresses of congratulation to the
King and Queen, upon his courage and conduct in the
field, and her fortitude and sagacity at the helm, in times
of danger and disquiet. The Commons, pursuant to
an estimate laid before them of the next year's ex∣penses,
voted a supply of four millions for the mainte∣nance
of the army and navy, and settled the funds for that
purpose.</P>
<P>§ XLII. They proposed to raise one million by the sale
of forfeited estates in Ireland: they resolved, that a bill
should be brought in for confiscating those estates, with
a clause, empowering the King to bestow a third part of
them on those who had served in the war, as well as to
grant such articles and capitulations to those who were in
arms, as he should think proper. This clause was reject∣ed;
and a great number of petitions were offered against
the bill, by creditors and heirs, who had continued
faithful to the government. These were supposed to have
been suggested by the court, in order to retard the pro∣gress
of the bill; for the estates had been already promised
to the King's favourites: nevertheless the bill passed the
Lower House, and was sent up to the Lords, among
whom it was purposely delayed by the influence of the
ministry. It was at this juncture that Lord Torrington
was tried and acquitted, very much to the dissatisfaction
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
of the King, who not only dismissed him from the service,
but even forbade him to appear in his presence. When
William came to the House of Lords, to give the royal
assent to a bill for doubling the Excise, he told the parlia∣ment,
that the posture of affairs required his presence at
the Hague; that, therefore, they ought to lose no time
in perfecting such other supplies as were still necessary for
the maintenance of the army and navy; and he reminded
them of making some provision for the expense of the
civil government. Two bills were accordingly passed for
granting to their Majesties the duties on goods imported,
for five years; and these, together with the mutiny-bill,
received the royal assent: upon which occasion the King
observed, that if some annual provision could be made for
augmenting the navy, it would greatly conduce to the
honour and safety of the nation. In consequence of this
hint, they voted a considerable supply for building addi∣tional
ships of war<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This supply was raised by the additional duties on beer, ale, and other liquors. They also provided in the bill, that the impositions on wines, vine∣gar, and tobacco, should be made a fund of credit: That the surplus of the grants they had made, after the current service was provided for, should be applicable to the payment of the debts contracted by the war; and, That it should be lawful for their Majesties to make use of five hundred thousand pounds, out of the said grants, on condition of that sum's being repaid from the revenue.—Ralph.</NOTE>, and proceeded with such alacrity
and expedition, as even seemed to anticipate the King's
desires. This liberality and dispatch were in a great mea∣sure
owing to the management of the Lord Godolphin,
who was now placed at the head of the Treasury, and Sir
John Somers, the Solicitor-General. The place of secre∣tary
of state, which had remained vacant since the resig∣nation
of the Earl of Shrewsbury, was now filled with
Lord Sidney; and Sir Charles Porter was appointed one
of the justices of Ireland, in the room of this nobleman.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Notwithstanding the act for reversing the
proceedings against the city-charter, the Whigs had made
shift to keep possession of the magistracy: Pilkington con∣tinued
Mayor, and Robinson retained the office of Cham∣berlain.
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
The Tories of the city, presuming upon their
late services, presented a petition to the House of Com∣mons,
complaining, That the intent of the late act of
parliament, for reversing the judgment on the <HI>Quo War∣ranto,</HI>
was frustrated by some doubtful expression: so that
the old Aldermen elected by commissions under the late
King's great seal still acted by virtue of that authority:
That Sir Thomas Pilkington was not duly returned as
Mayor by the common-hall: and, That he and the
Aldermen had imposed Mr. Leonard Robinson upon them
as Chamberlain, though another person was duly elected
into that office: That divers members of the common-council
were illegally excluded, and others, duly elected,
were refused admittance. They specified other grievances,
and petitioned for relief. Piikington and his associates
undertook to prove that those allegations were either false
or frivolous; and represented the petition as a contri∣vance
of the Jacobites, to disturb the peace of the city,
that the supply might be retarded, and the government
distressed. In the late panick which overspread the na∣tion,
the Whigs had appeared to be the monied men,
and subscribed largely for the security of the settlement
they had made, while the Tories kept aloof with a sus∣picious
caution. For this reason, the court now inter∣posed
its influence in such a manner, that little or no re∣gard
was paid to their remonstrance.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The Marquis of Caermarthen, Lord-Presi∣dent,
who was at the head of the Tory interest in the
ministry, and had acquired great credit with the King
and Queen, now fell under the displeasure of the oppo∣site
faction; and they resolved (if possible) to revive his
old impeachment. The Earl of Shrewsbury, and thirteen
other leading men, had engaged in this design. A com∣mittee
of Lords was appointed to examine precedents,
and enquire whether impeachments continued <HI>in slatu quo</HI>
from parliament to parliament. Several such precedents
were reported; and violent debates ensued: but, the
Marquis eluded the vengeance of his enemies, in conse∣quence
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
of the following question, “Whether the Earls
of Salisbury and Peterborough, who had been impeached
in the former parliament, for being reconciled to the
church of Rome, shall be discharged from their bail?”
The House resolved in the affirmative, and several lords
entered a protest. The Commons having finished a bill
for appointing commissioners to take and state the publick
accounts; and having chosen the commissioners from
among their own members, sent it up to the House of
Lords. There the Earl of Rochester moved, that they
should add some of their number to those of the Com∣mons:
they accordingly chose an equal number by ballot;
but Rochester himself being elected, refused to act: the
others followed his example, and the bill passed without
alteration. On the fifth day of January, the King put
an end to the session with a speech, in which he thanked
them for the repeated instances they had exhibited of their
affection to his person and government. He told them it
was high time for him to embark for Holland; recom∣mended
unanimity; and assured them of his particular
favour and protection. Then Lord Chief Baron Atkins
signified his Majesty's pleasure, that the two Houses
should adjourn themselves to the thirty-first day of
March<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this year the English planters repossessed themselves of part of the island of St. Christopher's, from which they had been driven by the French.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XLV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1691.</NOTE> William, having settled the affairs of the
nation, set out for Margate on the sixth day of January;
but, the ship in which he proposed to embark being de∣tained
by an easterly wind and hard frost, he returned to
Kensington. On the sixteenth, however, he embarked at
Gravesend with a numerous retinue, and set sail for Hol∣land,
under convoy of twelve ships of war, commanded by
Admiral Rooke. Next day, being informed by a fisher∣man,
that he was within a league and a half of Goree,
he quitted the yatch, and went into an open boat, attended
by the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Devonshire, Dorset,
Portland, and Monmouth, with Auverquerque, and Zuy∣lestein.
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
Instead of landing immediately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1691.</NOTE> they lost sight
of the fleet, and night coming on, were exposed in very
severe weather to the danger of the enemy and the sea,
which ran very high for eighteen hours, during which,
the King and all his attendants were drenched with sea-water.
When the sailors expressed their apprehensions of
perishing, the King asked if they were afraid to die in his
company? At day-break, he landed on the Isle of Goree,
where he took some refreshment in a fisherman's hut;
then he committed himself to the boat again, and was
conveyed to the shore in the neighbourhood of Maesland∣sluys.
A deputation of the States received him at
Hounslardyke: about six in the evening he arrived at the
Hague, where he was immediately complimented by the
States-General, the states of Holland, the council of state,
the other colleges, and the foreign ministers. He after∣wards,
at the request of the magistrates, made his publick
entry with surprising magnificence; and the Dutch cele∣brated
his arrival with bonfires, illuminations, and other
marks of tumultuous joy. He assisted at their different
assemblies; informed them of his successes in England
and Ireland; and assured them of his constant zeal and
affection for his native country.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. At a solemn congress of the confederate
princes, he represented, in a set speech, the dangers to
which they were exposed from the power and ambition of
France; and the necessity of acting with vigour and
dispatch. He declared he would spare neither his credit,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces, nor person, in concurring with their measures;
and that in the spring he would come at the head of his
troops to fulfil his engagements. They forthwith resolved
to employ two hundred and twenty-two thousand men
against France in the ensuing campaign. The proportions
of the different princes and states were regulated; and
the King of England agreed to furnish twenty thousand.
He supplied the Duke of Savoy so liberally, that his af∣fairs
soon assumed a more promising aspect. The plan of
operations was settled; and they transacted their affairs
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
with such harmony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1691.</NOTE> that no dispute interrupted their de∣liberations.
In the beginning of March, immediately
after the congress broke up, the siege of Mons was under∣taken
by the French King in person, accompanied by the
Dauphin, the Dukes of Orleans and Chartres. The
garrison consisted of about six thousand men, commanded
bythe Prince of Bergue: but the besiegers carried on
their works with such rapidity as they could not with∣stand.
King William no sooner understood that the
place was invested, than he ordered Prince Waldeck to
assemble the army, determined to march against the enemy
in person. Fifty thousand men were soon collected at
Halle, near Brussels: but, when he went thither, he found
the Spaniards had neglected to provide carriages, and other
necessaries for the expedition. Mean while, the burghers
of Mons, seeing their town in danger of being utterly de∣stroyed
by the bombs and cannon of the enemy, pressed
the governor to capitulate, and even threatened to intro∣duce
the besiegers: so that he was forced to comply, and
obtained very honourable conditions. William, being
apprised of this event, returned to the Hague, embarked
for England, and arrived at Whitehall on the thirteenth
day of April<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few days before his arrival, great part of the palace of Whitehall was consumed by fire, through the negligence of a female servant.</NOTE>.</P>

§ I. A Conspiracy against the government had been
lately discovered. In the latter end of De∣cember,
the master of a vessel who lived at Barking, in
Essex, informed the Marquis of Caermarthen, that his wife
had let out one of his boats to carry over some persons to
France; and that they would embark on the thirtieth day
of the month. This intelligence being communicated to
the King and council, an order was sent to Captain Bil∣lop,
to watch the motion of the vessel, and secure the
passengers. He accordingly boarded her at Gravesend,
and found in the hold Lord Preston, Mr. Ashton, a ser∣vant
of the late Queen, and one Elliot. He likewise seised
a bundle of papers, some of which were scarce intelligible;
among the rest, two letters, supposed to be written by
Turner, Bishop of Ely, to King James and his Queen,
under fictitious names. The whole amounted to an invi∣tation
to the French King, to assist King James in re∣ascending
the throne, upon certain conditions, while
William should be absent from the kingdom: but, the
scheme was ill laid, and countenanced but by a very
few persons of consideration, among whom the chiefs were
the Earl of Clarendon, the Bishop of Ely, Lord Preston,
his brother, Mr. Graham, and Penn, the famous quaker.
Notwithstanding the outcries which had been made against
the severities of the late government, Preston, and his
accomplice Ashton, were tried at the Old Bailey for com∣passing
the death of their Majesties King William and
Queen Mary; and their tryals were hurried on, without
any regard to their petitions for delay. Lord Preston
alledged, in his defence, that the treasons charged upon
him were not committed in the county of Middlesex, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid in the indictment; that none of the witnesses declared
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had any concern in hiring the vessel; that the papers
were not found upon him; that there ought to be two
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>
credible witnesses to every fact, whereas, the whole proof
against him rested on similitude of hands, and mere suppo∣sition.
He was, nevertheless, found guilty. Ashton
behaved with great intrepidity and composure. He owned
his purpose of going to France, in pursuance of a promise
he had made to General Worden, who, on his death-bed,
conjured him to go thither, and finish some affairs of con∣sequence
which he had left there depending; as well as with
a view to recover a considerable sum of money due to him∣self.
He denied that he was privy to the contents of the
papers found upon him: he complained of his having been
denied time to prepare for his trial; and called several
persons to prove him a protestant of exemplary piety and
irreproachable morals. These circumstances had no
weight with the court. He was brow-beaten by the
bench, and found guilty by the jury, as he had the papers
in his custody: yet, there was no privity proved; and
the Whig party themselves had often expressly declared▪
that of all sorts of evidence, that of finding papers in a
person's possession is the weakest, because no man can
secure himself from such danger. Ashton suffered with
equal courage and decorum. In a paper which he de∣livered
to the Sheriff, he owned his attachment to King
James: he witnessed to the birth of the Prince of Wales;
denied his knowledge of the contents of the papers that
were committed to his charge; complained of the hard
measure he had met with from the judges and the jury
but forgave them in the sight of heaven. This man was
celebrated by the Nonjurors as a martyr to loyalty; and
they boldly affirmed, that his chief crime in the eyes of
the government, was his having among his baggage, an
account of such evidence as would have been convincing
to all the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. State tracts. Burchet. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> concerning the birth of the Prince of
Wales, which by a great number of people was believed
suppositious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To one of the pamphlets published on this occasion, is annexed a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition to the present government, in the name of King James's adherent importing, that some grave and learned person should be authorised to com∣pile a treatise, showing the grounds of William's title; and declaring, that in case the performance should carry conviction along with it, they would submit to that title, as they had hither to opposed it from a principle of con∣science. The best answer that could be made to this summons, was Locke's book upon government, which appeared at this period. Ralph.</NOTE>. Lord Preston obtained a pardon: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>
was not tried, because no evidence appeared against him:
the Earl of Clarendon was sent to the Tower, where he
remained some months, and he was afterwards confined
to his own house in the country: an indulgence, which
he owed to his consanguinity with the Queen, who was
his first cousin. The Bishop of Ely, Graham, and Penn
absconded; and a proclamation was issued for appre∣hending
them as traitors.</P>
<P>§ II. This prelate's being concerned in a conspiracy
furnished the King with a plausible pretence for filling up
the vacant bishopricks. The deprived bishops had been
given to understand, that an act of parliament might be
obtained to excuse them from taking the oaths, provided
they would perform their episcopal functions: but, as
they declined this expedient, the King resolved to fill up
their places at his return from Holland. Accordingly,
the Archbishoprick of Canterbury was conferred upon Dr.
Tillotson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beveridge was promoted to the see of Bath and Wells, Fowler to that of Gloucester, Cumberland to Peterborough, Moore to Norwich, Grove to Chichester, and Patrick to Ely.</NOTE>, one of the most learned, moderate, and vir∣tuous
ecclesiasticks of the age, who did not accept of this
promotion without great reluctance, because he foresaw
that he should be exposed to the slander and malevolence
of that party which espoused the cause of his predecessor.
The other vacant sees were given to divines of un∣blemished
character; and the publick in general seemed
very well satisfied with this exertion of the King's su∣premacy.
The deprived bishops at first affected all the
meekness of resignation. They remembered those shouts
of popular approbation, by which they had been ani∣mated
in the persecution they suffered under the late
government; and they hoped the same cordial would sup∣port
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
them in their present affliction: but, finding the
nation cold in their concern, they determined to warm it
by argument and declamation. The press groaned with
the efforts of their learning and resentment; and every
essay was answered by their opponents. The Nonjurors
affirmed, that Christianity was a doctrine of the cross;
that no pretence whatever could justify an insurrection
against the Sovereign; that the primitive christians
thought it their indispensible duty to be passive under
every invasion of their rights; and, that non-resistance
was the doctrine of the English church, confirmed by all
the sanctions that could be derived from the laws of God
and man. The other party, not only supported the
natural rights of mankind, and explained the use that
might be made of the doctrine of non-resistance, in
exciting fresh commotions; but they also argued, that if
passive obedience was right in any instance, it was con∣clusively
so with regard to the present government; for
the obedience required by scripture was indiscriminate,
“the powers that be, are ordained of God—let every
soul be subject to the higher powers.” From these
texts they inferred, that the new oaths ought to be taken
without scruple; and that those who refused them, con∣cealed
party under the cloak of conscience. On the other
hand, the fallacy and treachery of this argument were de∣monstrated.
They said, it levelled all distinctions of ju∣stice
and duty; that those who taught such doctrines,
attached themselves solely to possession, however unjustly
acquired; that if twenty different usurpers should succeed
one another, they would recognise the last, notwithstand∣ing
the allegiance they had so solemnly sworn to his pre∣decessor,
like the fawning spaniel that followed the thief
who mounted his master's horse, after having murthered
the right owner. They also denied the justice of a lay-deprivation,
and with respect to church-government
started the same distinctions “<HI>De jure</HI> and <HI>De facto,</HI>”
which they had formerly made in the civil administration.
They had even recourse to all the bitterness of invective
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
against Tillotson and the new bishops, whom they reviled
as intruders and usurpers: their acrimony was chiefly
directed against Dr. Sherlock, who had been one of the
most violent sticklers against the revolution, but thought
proper to take the oaths upon the retreat of King James
from Ireland. They branded him as an apostate, who had
betrayed his cause, and published a review of his whole
conduct, which proved a severe satire upon his character.
Their attacks upon individuals were mingled with their
vengeance against the government: and indeed the great
aim of their divines, as well as of their politicians, was to
sap the foundation of the new settlement. In order to
alienate the minds of the people from the interests of the
reigning prince, they ridiculed his character: inveighed
against his measures: they accused him of sacrificing the
concerns of England to the advantage of his native
country; and drew invidious comparisons between the
wealth, the trade, the taxes of the last, and of the present
reign. To frustrate these efforts of the malcontents, the
court employed their engines to answer and recriminate:
all sorts of informers were encouraged and caressed: in a
proclamation issued against papists and other disaffected
persons, all magistrates were enjoined to make search, and
apprehend those who should, by seditious discourses and
libels, presume to defame the government. Thus the
Revolutioners commenced the professed enemies of those
very arts and practices which had enabled them to bring
their scheme to perfection.</P>
<P>§ III. The presbyterians in Scotland acted with such
folly, violence, and tyranny, as rendered them equally
odious and contemptible. The transactions in their
general assembly were carried on with such peevishness,
partiality, and injustice, that the King dissolved it by an
act of state, and convoked another for the month of No∣vember
in the following year. The episcopal party pro∣mised
to enter heartily into the interests of the new govern∣ment,
to keep the Highlanders quiet, and induce the
clergy to acknowledge and serve King William, provided
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
he would balance the power of Melvill and his partisans
in such a manner, as would secure them from violence and
oppression; provided the episcopal ministers should be per∣mitted
to perform their functions among those people by
whom they were beloved; and that such of them as were
willing to mix with the presbyterians in their judicatories,
should be admitted without any severe imposition in point
of opinion. The King, who was extremely disgusted at
the presbyterians, relished the proposal; and young Dal∣rymple,
son of Lord Stair, was appointed joint secretary
of state with Melvill. He undertook to bring over the
majority of the Jacobites, and a great number of them
took the oaths: but at the same time they maintained a
correspondence with the court of St. Germains, by the
connivance of which they submitted to William, that
they might be in a condition to serve James the more
effectually. The Scottish parliament was adjourned by
proclamation to the sixteenth day of September. Pre∣cautions
were taken to prevent any dangerous communi∣cation
with the continent: a committee was appointed to
put the kingdom in a posture of defence; to exercise the
powers of the regency, in securing the enemies of the
government; and the Earl of Home, with Sir Peter
Fraser and Sir Aeneas Macpherson were apprehended
and imprisoned.</P>
<P>§ IV. The King having settled the operations of the
ensuing campaign in Ireland, where General Gincke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
exercised the supreme command, manned his fleet by din<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of pressing sailors, to the incredible annoyance of com∣merce:
then, leaving the Queen as before at the helm o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
government in England, he returned to Holland, accom∣panied
by Lord Sidney, secretary of state, the Earls o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Marlborough and Portland, and began to make prepa∣rations
for taking the field in person. On the thirtieth
day of May, the Duke of Luxembourg having passed th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Scheld at the head of a large army, took possession o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Halle, and gave it up to plunder, in sight of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
who were obliged to throw up entrenchments so
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
their preservation. At the same time the Marquis de
Boufflers, with a considerable body of forces, entrenched
himself before Liege, with a view to bombard that city.
In the beginning of June, King William took upon him∣self
the command of the allied army, by this time re∣enforced
in such a manner as to be superior to the enemy.
He forthwith detached the County de Tilly, with ten thou∣sand
men, to the relief of Liege, which was already re∣duced
to ruins and desolation by the bombs, bullets, and
repeated attacks of Boufflers, who now thought proper to
retreat to Dinant. Tilly, having thus raised the siege,
and thrown a body of troops into Huy, rejoined the con∣federate
army, which had been augmented even since his
departure with six thousand men from Brandenburgh, and
ten thousand Hessians, commanded by the Landgrave in
person. Such was the vigilance of Luxembourg, that
William could not avail himself of his superiority. In
vain he exhausted his invention in marches, counter-marches,
and stratagems, to bring on a general engage∣ment:
the French marshal avoided it with such dexterity,
as baffled all his endeavours. In the course of this cam∣paign,
the two armies twice confronted each other: but
they were situated in such a manner that neither could
begin the attack without a manifest disadvantage. While
the King lay encamped at Court-sur-heure, a soldier,
corrupted by the enemy, set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to the fusees of several
bombs, the explosion of which might have blown up the
whole magazine, and produced infinite confusion in the
army, had not the mischief been prevented by the courage
of the men who guarded the artillery: even while the
fusees were burning they disengaged the waggons from
the line, and overturned them down the side of a hill;
so that the communication of the fire was intercepted.
The person who made this treacherous attempt being dis∣covered,
owned he had been employed for this purpose by
the Duke of Luxembourg. He was tried by a court∣martial,
and suffered the death of a traitor. Such per∣fidious
practices not only six an indelible share of infamy
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
on the French General, but prove how much the capacity
of William was dreaded by his enemies. King William,
quiting Court-sur-heure, encamped upon the plain of
St. Girard, where he remained till the fourth day of Sep∣tember,
consuming the forage, and exhausting the country.
Then he passed the Sambre near Jemeppe, while the
French crossed it at La Busiere, and both armies marched
towards Enghien. The enemy, perceiving the confede∣rates
were at their heels, proceeded to Gramont, passed the
Dender, and took possession of a strong camp between
Aeth and Oudenarde: William followed the same route,
and encamped between Aeth and Leuse. While he con∣tinued
in this post, the Hessian forces and those of Liege,
amounting to about eighteen thousand men, separated
from the army, and passed the Meuse at Namur: then the
King returned to the Hague, leaving the command to
Prince Waldeck, who forthwith removed to Leuse, and
on the twentieth day of the month began his march to
Cambron. Luxembourg, who watched his motions with
a curious eye, found means to attack him in his retreat so
suddenly, that his rear was surprised and defeated, though
the French were at last obliged to retire: the Prince con∣tinued
his route to Cambron, and in a little time both
armies retired into winter-quarters. In the mean time,
the Duke de Noailles besieged and took Urgel in Cata∣lonia,
while a French squadron, commanded by the Count
D'Etrees, bombarded Barcelona and Alicant.</P>
<P>§ V. The confederates had proposed to act vigorously
in Italy against the French; but the season was far ad∣vanced
before they were in a condition to take the field.
The Emperor and Spain had undertaken to furnish troops
to join the Duke of Savoy; and the maritime powers
contributed their proportion in money. The Elector of
Bavaria was nominated to the supreme command of the
Imperial forces in that country: the Marquis de Leganez,
governor of the Milanese, acted as trustee for the Spanish
monarch: Duke Schomberg, son of that great general
who lost his life at the Boyne, lately created Duke of
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
Leinster, managed the interest of William, as King of
England and Stadtholder, and commanded a body of the
Vaudois paid by Great-Britain. Before the German auxi∣liaries
arrived, the French had made great progress in
their conquests. Catinat besieged and took Villa-Franca,
Nice, and some other fortifications; then he reduced
Villana and Carmagnola, and detached the Marquis de
Feuquieres to invest Coni, a strong fortress garrisoned by
the Vaudois and French refugees. The Duke of Savoy
was now reduced to the brink of ruin. He saw almost all
his places of strength in the possession of the enemy: Coni
was besieged: and La Hoguette, another French general,
had forced the passes of the valley of Aoste, so that he had
free admission into the Verceillois, and the frontiers of the
Milanese. Turin was threatened with a bombardment;
the people were dispirited and clamorous, and their sove∣reign
lay with his little army encamped on the hill of
Montcallier, from whence he beheld his towns taken, and
his place of Rivoli destroyed. Duke Schomberg exhorted
him to act on the offensive, and give battle to Catinat,
while that officer's army was weakened by detachments,
and Prince Eugene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince Eugene, of Savoy, who in the sequel rivalled the same of the greatest warriors of antiquity, was descended on the father's side from the House of Savoy, and on the mother's from the family of Soissons, a branch of the House of Bourbon. His father was Eugene Maurice, of Savoy, Count of Soissons, Colonel of the Switzers, and Governor of Champagne and Brie: his mother was the celebrated Olympia de Mancini, niece of Cardinal Mazarine. Prince Eugene, finding himself neglected at the court of France, engaged as a soldier of fortune in the service of the Emperor, and soon distinguished himself by his great military talents: he was, moreover, an ac∣complished gentleman, learned, liberal, mild, and courteous; an unshaken friend; a generous enemy; an invincible captain; a con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmate politician.</NOTE> supported his remonstrance: but this
proposal was vehemently opposed by the Marquis de Lega∣nez,
who foresaw that, if the Duke should be defeated, the
French would penetrate into the territories of Milan. The
relief of Coni, however, was undertaken by Prince
Eugene, who began his march for that place with a convoy
guarded by two-and-twenty hundred horse: at Magliano
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>
he was re-enforced by five thousand militia: Bulonde,
who commanded at the siege, no sooner heard of his ap∣proach
than he retired with the utmost precipitation,
leaving behind some pieces of cannon, mortars, bombs,
arms, ammunition, tents, provisions, utensils, with all
his sick and wounded. When he joined Catinat, he was
immediately put under arrest, and afterwards cashiered
with disgrace. Hoguette abandoned the valley of Aoste:
Feuquieres was sent with a detachment to change the
garrison of Casal; and Catinat retired with his army to∣wards
Villa Nova d'Aste.</P>
<P>§ VI. The miscarriage of the French before Coni
affected Louvois, the minister of Louis, so deeply, that
he could not help shedding tears when he communicated
the event to his master, who told him, with great compo∣sure,
that he was spoiled by good fortune. But the re∣treat
of the French from Piedmont had a still greater in∣fluence
over the resolutions of the conclave at Rome, then
sitting for the election of a new pope, in the room of Alex∣ander
VIII. who died in the beginning of February. Not∣withstanding
the power and intrigues of the French
faction, headed by Cardinal D'Etrees, the affairs of
Piedmont had no sooner taken this turn, than the Italians
joined the Spanish and Imperial interest, and Cardinal
Pignatelli, a Neapolitan, was elected pontiff. He as∣sumed
the name of Innocent, in honour of the last pope
known by that appellation, and adopted all his maxims
against the French Monarch. When the German auxi∣liaries
arrived, under the command of the Elector of
Bavaria, the confederates resolved to give battle to Catinat;
but he repassed the Po, and sent couriers to Versailles, to
solicit a re-enforcement. Then Prince Eugene invested
Carmagnola, and carried on the siege with such vigour,
that in eleven days the garrison capitulated. Mean while
the Marquis de Hocquincourt undertook the conquest of
Montmelian, and reduced the town without much resist∣ance.
The castle, however, made such a vigorous de∣fence,
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>
that Catinat marched thither in person; and not∣withstanding
all his efforts, the place held out till the
second day of December, when it surrendered on honour∣able
conditions.</P>
<P>§ VII. This summer produced nothing of importance on
the Rhine. The French endeavoured to surprise Mentz,
by maintaining a correspondence with one of the Emperor's
commissioners: but this being discovered, their design
was frustrated. The Imperial army, under the Elector
of Saxony, passed the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Man∣heim;
and the French crossing the same river at Philips∣burgh,
reduced the town of Portzheim in the marquisate of
Baden-Dourlach. The execution of the scheme, pro∣jected
by the Emperor for this campaign, was prevented
by the death of his general, the Elector of Saxony, which
happened on the second day of September. His affairs
wore a more favourable aspect in Hungary, where the
Turks were totally defeated by Prince Louis of Baden on
the banks of the Danube. The Imperialists afterwards
undertook the siege of Great Waradin in Transylvania;
but this was turned into a blockade, and the place was
not surrendered till the following spring. The Turks
were so dispirited by the defeat by which they had lost
the Grand Visir, that the Emperor might have made
peace upon very advantageous terms; but his pride and
ambition overshot his success. He was weak, vain, and
superstitious; he imagined that now the war of Ireland
was almost extinguished, King William, with the rest of
the allies, would be able to humble the French power,
though he himself should not co-operate with hereticks,
whom he abhorred; and that, in the mean time, he
should not only make an entire conquest of Transylvania,
but also carry his victorious arms to the Gates of Constan∣tinople,
according to some ridiculous prophecy by which
his vanity had been slattered. The Spanish government
was become so feeble, that the ministry, rather than be at
the expence of defending the Netherlands, offered to deli∣ver
the whole country to King William, either as Mo∣narch
<PB N="118" REF="122"/>
of England, or Stadtholder of the United Provinces.
He declined this offer, because he knew the people would
never be reconciled to a protestant government; but he
proposed that the Spaniards should confer the administra∣tion
of Flanders upon the Elector of Bavaria, who was
ambitious of signalising his courage, and able to defend
the country with his own troops and treasure. This pro∣posal
was relished by the court of Spain: the Emperor
imparted it to the Elector, who accepted the office with∣out
hesitation; and he was immediately declared Governor
of the Low-Countries by the council of state at Madrid.
King William, after his return from the army, continued
some time at the Hague, settling the operations of the
ensuing campaign. That affair being discussed, he em∣barked
in the Maese, and landed in England on the
nineteenth day of October.</P>
<P>§ VIII. Before we explain the proceedings in parlia∣ment,
it will be necessary to give a detail of the late
transactions in Ireland. In the beginning of the season
the French King had sent a large supply of provision,
clothes, and ammunition, for the use of the Irish at
Limerick, under the conduct of Monsieur St. Ruth,
accompanied by a great number of French officers, fur∣nished
with commissions from King James, though St.
Ruth issued all his orders in the name of Louis. Tyrconnel
had arrived in January, with three frigates and nine
vessels, laden with succours of the same nature: other∣wise
the Irish could not have been so long kept together.
Nor, indeed, could these supplies prevent them from
forming separate and independent bands of Rapparees, who
plundered the country, and committed the most shocking
barbarities. The Lords Justices, in conjunction with
General Ginckel, had taken every step their prudence
could suggest, to quiet the disturbances of the country,
and prevent such violence and rapine, of which the
soldiers in King William's army were not entirely inno∣cent.
The justices had issued proclamations, denouncing
severe penalties against those who should countenance or
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
conceal such acts of cruelty and oppression: they promised
to protect all papists who should live quietly within a cer∣tain
frontier line; and Ginckel gave the catholick rebels to
understand, that he was authorised to treat with them, if
they were inclined to return to their duty. Before the
armies took the field several skirmishes had been fought
between parties; and these had always turned out so un∣fortunate
to the enemy, that their spirits were quite
depressed, while the confidence of the English rose in the
same proportion.</P>
<P>§ IX. St. Ruth and Tyrconnel were joined by the Rap∣parces,
and General Ginckel was re-enforced by Mackay,
with those troops which had reduced the Highlanders in
Scotland. Thus strengthened, he, in the beginning of
June, marched from Mullingar to Ballymore, which was
garrisoned by a thousand men under Colonel Bourke,
who, when summoned to surrender, returned an evasive
answer. But, when a breach was made in the place, and
the besiegers began to make preparations for a general
assault, his men laid down their arms and submitted at
discretion. The fortifications of this place being repaired
and augmented, the general left a garrison for its defence,
and advanced to Athlone, situated on the other side of the
Shannon, and supported by the Irish army encamped almost
under its walls. The English town, on the hither side of
the river, was taken sword in hand, and the enemy broke
down an arch of the bridge in their retreat. Batteries
were raised against the Irish town, and several unsuccessful
attempts were made to force the passage of the bridge,
which was defended with great vigour. At length, it was
resolved, in a council of war, that a detachment should
pass at a ford a little to the left of the bridge, though the
river was deep and rapid, the bottom foul and stony, and
the pass guarded by ravelin, erected for that purpose.
The forlorn hope consisted of sixty grenadiers in armour,
headed by Captain Sandys, and two lientenants. They
were seconded by another detachment, and this was sup∣ported
by six battalions of infantry. Never was a more
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
desperate service, nor was ever exploit performed with
more valour and intrepidity. They passed twenty a-breast,
in the face of the enemy, through an incessant shower of
balls, bullets, and grenades. Those who followed them
took possession of the bridge, and laid planks over the
broken arch. Pontoons were fixed at the same time, that
the troops might pass in different places. The Irish were
amazed, confounded, and abandoned the town in the
utmost consternation; so that, in half an hour, it was
wholly secured by the English, who did not lose above
fifty men in this attack. Mackay, Tetteau, and Ptole∣mache,
exhibited proofs of the most undaunted courage in
passing the river, and General Ginckel, for his conduct,
intrepidity, and success, on this occasion, was created Earl
of Athlone. When St. Ruth was informed by express,
that the English had entered the river, he said it was
impossible they should pretend to take a town which he
covered with his army, and that he would give a thou∣sand
pistoles they would attempt to force a passage.
Sarsfield insisted upon the truth of the intelligence, and
pressed him to send succours to the town: he ridiculed this
officer's fears, and some warm expostulation passed be∣tween
them. Being at length convinced that the English
were in possession of the place, he ordered some detach∣ments
to drive them out again; but, the cannon of their
own works being turned against them, they found the task
impracticable; and that very night their army decamped.
St. Ruth, after a march of ten miles, took post at
Aghrim, and having, by drafts from garrisons, aug∣mented
his army to five-and-twenty thousand men, resolv∣ed
to hazard a decisive engagement.</P>
<P>§ X. Ginckel having put Athlone in a posture of de∣fence,
passed the Shannon, and marched up to the enemy,
determined to give them battle, though his forces did not
exceed eighteen thousand, and the Irish were posted in a
very advantageous situation. St. Ruth had made an ad∣mirable
disposition, and taken every precaution that mili∣tary
skill could suggest. His centre extended along a
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>
rising ground, uneven in many places, intersected with
banks and ditches, joined by lines of communication, and
fronted by a large bog almost impassable. His right was
fortified with entrenchments, and his left secured by the
castle of Aghrim. He harangued his army in the most
pathetick strain, conjuring them to exert their courage in
defence of their holy religion, in the extirpation of heresy,
in recovering their ancient honours and estates, and in
restoring a pious king to the throne, from whence he had
been expelled by an unnatural usurper. He employed the
priests to enforce his exhortations; to assure the men that
they might depend upon the prayers of the church; and
that, in case they should fall in battle, the saints and
angels would convey their souls to heaven. They are said
to have sworn upon the sacrament, that they would not
desert their colours, and to have received an order that no
quarter should be given to the French hereticks in the
army of the Prince of Orange. Ginckel had encamped
on the Roscommon side of the river Suc, within three
miles of the enemy: after having reconnoitred their
posture, he resolved, with the advice of a council of war,
to attack them on Sunday the twelfth day of July. The
necessary orders being given, the army passed the river at
two fords and a stone bridge, and, advancing to the edge
of the great bog, began about twelve o'clock to force the
two passages, in order to possess the ground on the other
side. The enemy fought with surprising fury, and the
horse were several times repulsed; but, at length, the
troops upon the right carried their point by means of some
field pieces. The day was now so far advanced, that the
General determined to postpone the battle till next morn∣ing;
but, perceiving some disorder among the enemy, and
fearing they would decamp in the night, he altered his
resolution, and ordered the attack to be renewed. At six
o'clock in the evening the left wing of the English ad∣vanced
to the right of the Irish, from whom they met
with such a warm and obstinate reception, that it was not
without the most surprising efforts of courage and perse∣verance
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
that they at length obliged them to give ground;
and even then they lost it by inches. St. Ruth, seeing
them in danger of being overpowered, immediately de∣tached
succours to them from his centre and left wing.
Mackay no sooner perceived them weakened by these de∣tachments,
than he ordered three battalions to skirt the
bog, and attack them on the left, while the centre ad∣vanced
through the middle of the morass, the men wading
up to the waist in mud and water. After they had reached
the other side, they found themselves obliged to ascend a
rugged hill, fenced with hedges and ditches; and these
were lined with musqueteers, supported at proper inter∣vals
with squadrons of cavalry. They made such a despe∣rate
resistance, and fought with such impetuosity, that
the assailants were repulsed into the middle of the bog with
great loss, and St. Ruth exclaimed—“Now will I drive
the English to the gates of Dublin.” In this critical
conjuncture Ptolemache came up with a fresh body to
sustain them, rallied the broken troops, and renewed the
charge with such vigour, that the Irish gave way in their
turn, and the English recovered the ground they had lost,
though they found it impossible to improve their advantage.
Mackay brought a body of horse and dragoons to the
assistance of the left wing, and first turned the tide of battle
in favour of the English. Major-General Rouvigny, who
had behaved with great gallantry during the whole action,
advanced with five regiments of cavalry to support the
centre, when St. Ruth perceiving his design, resolved to
fall upon him in a dangerous hollow way, which he was
obliged to pass. For this purpose, he began to descend
Kircommodon-hill with his whole reserve of horse: but
in his way was killed by a cannon-ball. His troops imme∣diately
halted, and his guards retreated with his body.
His fate dispirited the troops, and produced such confusion
as Sarsfield could not remedy; for though he was next i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
command, he had been at variance with St. Ruth sinc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the affair at Athlone, and was ignorant of the plan he
had concerted. Rouvigny, having passed the hollow wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
without opposition, charged the enemy in flank, and bore
down all before him with surprising impetuosity: the
centre redoubled their efforts, and pushed the Irish to the
top of the hill, and then the whole line giving way at
once from right to left, threw down their arms. The foot
fled towards a bog in their rear, and their horse took the
route by the highway to Loughneagh: both were pursued
by the English cavalry, who for four miles made a terrible
slaughter. In the battle, which lasted two hours, and in
the pursuit, above four thousand of the enemy were slain,
and six hundred taken, together with all their baggage,
tents, provision, ammunition, and artillery, nine-and-twenty
pair of colours, twelve standards, and almost all
the arms of the infantry. In a word, the victory was
decisive, and not above eight hundred of the English were
killed upon the field of battle. The vanquished retreated
in great confusion to Limerick, where they resolved to
make a final stand, in hope of receiving such succours
from France as would either enable them to retrieve their
affairs, or obtain good terms from the court of England.
There Tyrconnel died of a broken heart, after having
survived his authority and reputation. He had incurred
the contempt of the French, as well as the hatred of the
Irish, whom he had advised to submit to the new govern∣ment,
rather than totally ruin themselves and their fa∣milies.</P>
<P>§ XI. Immediately after the battle, detachments were
sent to reduce Portumny, Bonnachar, and Moor-castle,
considerable passes on the Shannon, which were accord∣ingly
secured. Then Ginckel advanced to Galway, which
he summoned to surrender; but he received a defiance from
Lord Dillon and General D'Ussone, who commanded the
garrison. The trenches were immediately opened; a
fort which commanded the approaches to the town was
taken by assault; six regiments of foot, and four squa∣drons
of horse, passed the river on pontoons; and the
place being wholly invested, the governor thought proper
to capitulate. The garrison marched out with the honours
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>
of war, and was allowed safe-conduct to Limerick.
Ginckel directed his march to the same town, which was
the only post of consequence that now held out for King
James. Within four miles of the place he halted, until
the heavy cannon could be brought from Athlone. Hear∣ing
that Luttrel had been seised by the French general
D'Ussone, and sentenced to be shot for having proposed
to surrender, he sent a trumpet, to tell the commander,
that if any person should be put to death for such a pro∣posal,
he would make retaliation on the Irish prisoners.
On the twenty-fifth day of August the enemy were driven
from all their advanced posts: Captain Cole, with a squa∣dron
of ships, sailed up the Shannon, and his frigates an∣chored
in sight of the town. On the twenty-sixth day of
the month the batteries were opened, and a line of con∣travallation
was formed: the Irish army lay encamped on
the other side of the river, on the road to Killalow, and
the fords were guarded with four regiments of their dra∣goons.
On the fifth day of September, after the town had
been almost laid in ruins by the bombs, and large breaches
made in the walls by the battering cannon, the guns were
dismounted, the out forts evacuated, and such other
motions made as indicated a resolution to abandon the
siege. The enemy expressed their joy in loud acclama∣tions;
but this was of short continuance. In the night
the besiegers began to throw a bridge of pontoons over the
river, about a mile higher up than the camp; and this
work was finished before morning. A considerable body
of horse and foot had passed when the alarm was given
to the enemy, who were seised with such consternation,
that they threw down their arms, and betook themselves to
flight, leaving behind them their tents, baggage, two
pieces of cannon, and one standard. The bridge was
immediately removed nearer the town, and forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied: all
the fords and passes were secured, and the batteries con∣tinued
firing incessantly till the twenty-second day of the
month, when Ginckel passed over with a division of the
army, and fourteen pieces of cannon. About four in the
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
afternoon, the grenadiers attacked the forts that com∣manded
Thomond-bridge, and carried them sword in
hand, after an obstinate resistance. The garrison had
made a sally from the town to support them; and this
detachment was driven back with such precipitation, that
the French officer on command in that quarter, fearing
the English would enter pell-mell with the fugitives,
ordered the bridge to be drawn up, leaving his own men
to the fury of a victorious enemy. Six hundred were
killed, two hundred taken prisoners, including many of∣ficers,
and a great number were drowned in the Shannon.</P>
<P>§ XII. Then the English made a lodgment within ten
paces of the bridge-foot; and the Irish, seeing themselves
surrounded on all sides, determined to capitulate. General
Sarsfield and Colonel Wahop signified their resolution to
Scravenmore and Rouvigny: hostages were exchanged;
à negociation was immediately begun, and hostilities
ceased on both sides of the river. The Lords Justices
arrived in the camp on the first day of October, and on
the fourth the capitulation was executed, extending to all
all the places in the kingdom that were still in the hands
of the Irish. The Roman catholics were restored to the
enjoyment of such liberty in the exercise of religion as was
consistent with the laws of Ireland, and conformable
with that which they possessed in the reign of Charles II.
All persons whatever were entitled to the protection of
these laws, and restored to the possession of their estates,
privileges, and immunities, upon their submitting to the
present government, and taking the oath of allegiance to
their Majesties King William and Queen Mary, except∣ing,
however, certain persons who were forfeited or exiled.
This article even extended to all merchants of Limerick,
or any other garrison possessed by the Irish, who happened
to be abroad, and had not born arms since the declara∣tion
in the first year of the present reign, provided they
should return within the term of eight months. All the
persons comprised in this and the foregoing article were
indulged with a general pardon of all attainders, out∣lawries,
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>
treasons, misprisions of treason, premunires, fel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nies,
trespasses, and other crimes and misdemeanors what<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soever,
committed since the beginning of the reign of Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
II. and the Lords Justices promised to use their best e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>deavours
towards the reversal of such attainders and out∣lawries
as had passed against any of them in parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
In order to allay the violence of party, and extinguis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
private animosities, it was agreed, that no person shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be sued or impleaded on either side, for any trespass, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made accountable for the rents, tenements, lands, or houses
he had received or enjoyed since the beginning of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
war. Every nobleman and gentleman comprised in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
articles was authorised to keep a sword, a case of pistol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and a gun for his defence or amusement. The inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Limerick and other garrisons, were permitted to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>move
their goods and chattels, without search, visitation
or payment of duty. The Lords Justices promised to us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their best endeavours, that all persons comprehended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
this capitulation should for eight months be protecte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from all arrests and executions for debt or damage: the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
undertook, that their Majesties should ratify these article<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
within the space of eight months, and use their endeavour
that they might be ratified and confirmed in parliament
The subsequent article was calculated to indemnify Col<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
John Brown, whose estate and effects had been seised fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the use of the Irish army by Tyrconnel and Sarsfield
which last had been created Lord Lucan by King James
and was now mentioned by that title. All persons wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
indulged with free leave to remove with their families an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
effects to any other country, except England and Scotland▪
All officers and soldiers in the service of King James
comprehending even the Rapparees, willing to go beyon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sea, were at liberty to march in bodies to the places o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
embarkation, to be conveyed to the continent with the
French officers and troops. They were furnished with
passports, convoys, and carriages by land and water; and
General Ginckel engaged to provide seventy ships, if ne∣cessary,
for their transportation, with two men of war for
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
the accommodation of their officers, and to serve as a
convoy to the fleet. It was stipulated, That the provisions
and forage for their assistance should be paid for on their
arrival in France: That hostages should be given for this
indemnification, as well as for the return of their ships:
That all the garrisons should march out of their respective
towns and fortresses with the honours of war: That the
Irish should have liberty to transport nine hundred horses:
That those who should choose to stay behind, might dis∣pose
of themselves according to their own fancy, after
having surrendered their arms to such commissioners as
the General should appoint: That all prisoners of war
should be set at liberty on both sides: That the General
should provide two vessels to carry over two different
persons to France, with intimation of this treaty; and
that none of those who were willing to quit the kingdom
should be detained on account of debt, or any other pre∣tence.—
This is the substance of the famous treaty of
Limerick, which the Irish Roman catholics consider as
the great charter of their civil and religious liberties. The
town of Limerick was surrendered to Ginckel; but both
sides agreed, that the two armies should entrench them∣selves,
till the Irish could embark, that no disorders
might arise from a communication.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The protestant subjects of Ireland were ex∣tremely
disgusted at these concessions made in favour of
vanquished rebels, who had exercised such acts of cruelty
and rapine. They complained, that they themselves,
who had suffered for their loyalty to King William, were
neglected, and obliged to sit down with their losses, while
their enemies, who had shed so much blood in opposing
his government, were indemnified by the articles of the
capitulation, and even favoured with particular indulgen∣cies.
They were dismissed with the honours of war:
they were transported at the government's expence, to
fight against the English in foreign countries: an honour∣able
provision was made for the Rapparees, who were
professed banditti; the Roman catholic interest in Ireland
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
obtained the sanction of regal authority: attainders were
overlooked, forfeitures annulled, pardons extended, and
laws set aside, in order to effect a pacification. Ginckel
had received orders to put an end to the war at any rate,
that William might convert his whole influence and at∣tention
to the affairs of the continent. When the arti∣cles
of capitulation were ratified, and hostages exchanged
for their being duly executed, about two thousand Irish
foot, and three hundred horse, began their march for
Cork, where they proposed to take shipping for France,
under the conduct of Sarsfield: but, three regiments re∣fusing
to quit the kingdom, delivered up their arms, and
dispersed to their former habitations. Those who remained
at Limerick embarked on the seventh day of November,
in French transports; and sailed immediately to France,
under convoy of a French squadron which had arrived in
the bay of Dingle immediately after the capitulation
was signed. Twelve thousand men chose to under∣go
exile from their native country, rather than submit to
the government of King William. When they arrived
in France, they were welcomed by a letter from James,
who thanked them for their loyalty; assured them they
should still serve under his commission and command;
and that the King of France had already given orders for
their being new clothed, and put into quarters of refresh∣ment.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The reduction of Ireland being thus completed,
Baron Ginckel returned to England, where he was so∣lemnly
thanked by the House of Commons for his great
services, after he had been created Earl of Athlone by his
Majesty. When the parliament met on the twenty-second
day of October, the King in his speech, insisted
upon the necessity of sending a strong fleet to sea, early
iu the season, and of maintaining a considerable army, to
annoy the enemy abroad, as well as to protect the king∣dom
from insult and invasion; for which purposes, he
said, sixty-five thousand men would be barely sufficient.
Each house presented an address of congratulation upon
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>
his Majesty's safe return to England, and on the reduction
of Ireland: they promised to assist him to the utmost of
their power, in prosecuting the war with France; and, at
the same time, drew up addresses to the Queen, acknow∣ledging
her prudent administration during his Majesty's
absence. Notwithstanding this appearance of cordiality
and complaisance, a spirit of discontent had insinuated
itself into both Houses of Parliament, and even infected
great part of the nation.</P>
<P>§ XV. A great number of individuals, who wished
well to their country, could not, without anxiety and
resentment, behold the interest of the nation sacrificed to
foreign connections, and the King's favour so partially
bestowed upon Dutchmen, in prejudice to his English
subjects. They observed, that the number of forces he
demanded was considerably greater than that of any army
which had ever been paid by the publick, even when the
nation was in the most imminent danger: that, instead of
contributing as allies to the maintenance of the war upon
the continent, they had embarked as principals, and bore
the greatest part of the burthen, though they had the least
share of the profit. They even insinuated, that such a
standing army was more calculated to make the King
absolute at home, than to render him formidable abroad;
and the secret friends of the late King did not fail to en∣force
these insinuations. They renewed their animad∣versions
upon the disagreeable part of his character: they
dwelt upon his proud reserve, his sullen silence, his im∣perious
disposition, and his base ingratitude, particularly
to the Earl of Marlborough, whom he had dismissed from
all his employments, immediately after the signal exploits
he had performed in Ireland. The disgrace of this noble∣man
was partly ascribed to the freedom with which he
had complained of the King's undervaluing his services,
and partly to the intrigues of his wife, who had gained an
ascendency over the Princess Anne of Denmark, and is
said to have employed her influence in fomenting a jealousy
between the two sisters. The malcontents of the whiggish
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
faction, enraged to find their credit declining at court,
joined in the cry which the Jacobites had raised against
the government. They scrupled not to say, that the arts
of corruption were shamefully practised, to secure a ma∣jority
in parliament: that the King was as tender of the
prerogative as any of his predecessors had ever been; and,
that he even ventured to admit Jacobites into his council,
because they were the known tools of arbitrary power.
These reflections alluded to the Earls of Rochester and
Ranelagh, who, with Sir Edward Seymour, had been
lately created privy-counsellors. Rochester entertained
very high notions of regal authority: he proposed severity
as one of the best supports of government; was clear in his
understanding, violent in his temper, and incorrupt in his
principles. Ranelagh was a man of parts and pleasure,
who possessed the most plausible and winning address;
and was capable of transacting the most important and
intricate affairs, in the midst of riot and debauchery. He
had managed the revenue of Ireland in the reign of
Charles II. He enjoyed the office of pay-master in the
army of King James; and now maintained the same
footing under the government of William and Mary.
Sir Edward Seymour was the proudest commoner in
England, and the boldest orator that ever filled the
Speaker's chair. He was intimately acquainted with the
business of the House, and knew every individual mem∣ber
so exactly, that with one glance of his eye he could
prognosticate the fate of every motion. He had opposed
the court with great acrimony, questioned the King's
title, censured his conduct, and reflected upon his cha∣racter.
Nevertheless, he now became a proselyte, and
was brought into the Treasury.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The Commons voted three millions, four
hundred and eleven thousand, six hundred and seventy-five
pounds for the use of the ensuing year: but, the
establishment of funds for raising these supplies was re∣tarded,
partly by the ill-humour of the opposition, and
partly by intervening affairs that diverted the attention of
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
the Commons. Several eminent merchants presented a
petition to the House against the East-India Company,
charging them with manifold abuses; at the same time, a
counter-petition was delivered by the Company, and the
affair referred to the examination of a committee appointed
for that purpose. After a minute enquiry into the nature
of the complaints, the Commons voted certain regulations
with respect to the stock and the traffick; and resolved to
petition his Majesty, that, according to the said regula∣tions,
the East-India Company should be incorporated by
charter. The committee was ordered to bring in a bill
for this establishment: but divers petitions being presented
against it, and the Company's answers proving unsatis∣factory,
the House addressed the King to dissolve it, and
grant a charter to a new company. He said, it was an
affair of great importance to the trade of the kingdom;
therefore, he would consider the subject, and in a little
time return a positive answer. The parliament was like∣wise
amused by a pretended conspiracy of the papists in
Lancashire, to raise a rebellion, and restore James to the
throne. Several persons were seised, and some witnesses
examined: but nothing appeared to justify the infor∣mation.
At length, one Fuller, a prisoner in the King's
Bench, offered his evidence, and was brought to the bar
of the House of Commons, where he produced some
papers. He obtained a blank pass from the King for two
persons, who, he said, would come from the continent to
give evidence. He was afterwards examined at his own
lodgings, where he affirmed, that Colonel Thomas Dela∣val,
and James Hayes, were the witnesses for whom he
had procured the pass and the protection. Search was
made for them, according to his direction: but no such
persons were found. Then the House declared Fuller a
notorious impostor, cheat, and false accuser. He was, at
the request of the Commons, prosecuted by the Attorney-General,
and sentenced to stand in the pillory; a dis∣grace,
which he accordingly underwent.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136"/>
§ XVII. A bill for regulating trials in cases of high-treason
having been laid aside by the Lords in the pre∣ceding
session, was now again brought upon the carpet,
and passed the Lower House. The design of this bill
was to secure the subject from the rigours to which he
had been exposed in the late reigns. It provided, That
the prisoner should be furnished with a copy of his in∣dictment,
as also of the pannel, ten days before his trial;
and, That his witnesses should be examined upon oath,
as well as those of the crown. The Lords, in their own
behalf, added a clause, enacting, That upon the trial of
any peer or peeress, for treason or misprision of treason,
all the peers who have a right to sit and vote in parlia∣ment
should be duely summoned to assist at the trial:
That this notice should be given twenty days before the
trial: and, That every peer so summoned, and appear∣ing,
should vote upon the occasion. The Commons re∣jected
this amendment; and a free conference ensued.
The point was argued with great vivacity on both sides,
which served only to inflame the dispute, and render each
party the more tenacious of their own opinion. After
three conferences that produced nothing but animosity,
the bill was dropped; for the Commons resolved to bear
the hardships of which they complained, rather than be
relieved at the expence of purchasing a new privilege to
the Lords: and without this advantage, the peers would
not contribute to their relief.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The next object that engrossed the attention
of the Lower House, was the miscarriage of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet
during the summer's expedition. Admiral Russel, who
commanded at sea, having been joined by a Dutch squa∣dron,
sailed in quest of the enemy: but, as the French
King had received undoubted intelligence, that the com∣bined
squadrons were superior to his navy in number of
ships and weight of metal, he ordered Tourville to avoid
an engagement. This officer acted with such vigilance,
caution, and dexterity, as baffled all the endeavours of
Russel, who was, moreover, perplexed with obscure and
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
contradictory orders. Nevertheless, he cruised all summer,
either in the channel or in soundings, for the protection
of the trade, and, in particular, secured the homeward-bound
Smyrna fleet, in which the English and Dutch had
a joint concern, amounting to four millions sterling.
Having scoured the channel, and sailed along great part of the
French coast, he returned to Torbay in the beginning
of August, and received fresh orders to put to sea again,
notwithstanding his repeated remonstrances against ex∣posing
large ships to the storms that always blow about
the time of the equinox. He, therefore, sailed back to
soundings, where he continued cruising till the second day
of September, when he was overtaken by a violent tempest,
which drove him into the channel, and obliged him to
make for the port of Plymouth. The weather being
hazy, he reached the Sound with great difficulty: the
Coronation, a second-rate, foundered at anchor off the
Ram-Head: the Harwich, a third-rate, bulged upon the
rocks, and perished: two others ran ashore, but were got
off with little damage: but the whole fleet was scattered
and distressed. The nation murmured at the supposed
misconduct of the Admiral, and the Commons subjected
him to an enquiry: but, when they examined his papers,
orders, and instructions, they perceived he had adhered to
them with great punctuality, and thought proper to drop
the prosecution, out of tenderness to the ministry. Then
the House took into consideration some letters which had
been intercepted in a French ship taken by Sir Ralph
Delaval. Three of these are said to have been written by
King James, and the rest sealed with his seal. They re∣lated
to the plan of an insurrection in Scotland, and in the
northern parts of England: Legge Lord Dartmouth, with
one Crew, being mentioned in them as agents and abettors
in the design, warrants were immediately issued against
them. Crew absconded, but Lord Dartmouth was com∣mitted
to the Tower. Lord Preston was examined touch∣ing
some cyphers which they could not explain, and, pre∣tending
ignorance, was imprisoned in Newgate, from
<PB N="134" REF="138"/>
whence, however, he soon obtained his release. The
funds for the supplies of the ensuing year being established,
and several acts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The laws enacted in this session were these:—an act for abrogating the oath of supremacy in Ireland, and appointing other oaths—an act for taking away clergy from some offenders, and bringing others to punishment—an act against deer-stealing—an act for repairing the high ways, and settling the rates of carriage of goods—an act for the relief of creditors against fraud∣ulent devises—an act for explaining and supplying the defects of former <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws for the settlement of the poor—an act for the encouragement of the breeding and feeding of cattle—and an act for ascertaining the tithes of hemp and flax.</NOTE> passed relating to domestick regulations,
the King, on the twenty-fourth day of February, closed
the session with a short speech, thanking the parliament
for their demonstrations of affection in the liberal supplies
they had granted, and communicating his intention of
repairing speedily to the continent. Then the two
Houses, at his desire, adjourned themselves to the twelfth
day of April, and the parliament was afterwards prorogued
to the twenty-ninth day of May, by proclamation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the course of this session, Dr. Welwood, a Scottish physician, was taken into custody, and reprimanded at the bar of the House of Commons, for having reflected upon that House in a weekly paper entitled Mercurius Reformatus; but, as it was written in defence of the government, the King appointed him one of his physicians in ordinary. At this period, Charles Montagu, afterwards Earl of Hallifax, distinguished himself in the House of Commons by his fine talents and eloquence. The privy-seal was com∣mitted to the Earl of Pembroke; Lord Viscount Sidney was created Lord Lieutenant of Ireland: Sir John Sommers appointed Attorney-General▪ and the see of Lincoln, vacant by the death of Barlow, conferred upon Dr. Thomas Tonnison, who had been recommended to the King, as a divine remarkable for his piety and moderation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The King had suffered so much in his repu∣tation
by his complaisance to the presbyterians of Scot∣land,
and was so displeased with the conduct of that stub∣born
sect of religionists, that he thought proper to admit
some prelatists into the administration. Johnston, who
had been sent envoy to the Elector of Brandenburgh, was
recalled, and with the Master of Stair, made joint secre∣tary
of Scotland; Melvill, who had declined in his im∣portance,
was made Lord Privy-Seal of that kingdom:
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
Tweedale was constituted Lord Chancellor: Crawfurd
retained the office of president of the council; and Lo∣thian
was appointed high commissioner to the general
assembly. The parliament was adjourned to the fifteenth
day of April, because it was not yet compliant enough to
be assembled with safety; and the episcopal clergy were
admitted to a share of the church-government. These
measures, instead of healing the divisions, served only to
enflame the animosity of the two parties. The epis∣copalians
triumphed in the King's favour, and began to
treat their antagonists with insolence and scorn: the pre∣sbyterians
were incensed to see their friends disgraced, and
their enemies distinguished by the royal indulgence. They
insisted upon the authority of the law, which happened
to be upon their side: they became more than ever sour,
surly, and implacable: they refused to concur with the
prelatists, or abate in the least circumstance of discipline;
and the assembly was dissolved, without any time or place
assigned for the next meeting. The presbyterians pre∣tended
an independent right of assembling annually, even
without a call from his Majesty; they therefore adjourned
themselves, after having protested against the dissolution.
The King resented this measure, as an insolent invasion of
the prerogative, and conceived an aversion to the whole
sect, who in their turn began to lose all respect for his
person and government.</P>
<P>§ XX. As the Highlanders were not yet totally reduced,
the Earl of Breadalbane undertook to bring them over,
by distributing sums of money among their chiefs; and
fifteen thousand pounds were remitted from England for
this purpose. The clans being informed of this remit∣tance,
suspected that the Earl's design was to appropriate
to himself the best part of the money, and when he began
to treat with them made such extravagant demands, that
he found his scheme impracticable. He was, therefore,
obliged to refund the sum he had received; and he re∣solved
to wreak his vengeance with the first opportunity, on
those who had frustrated his intention. He who chiefly
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
thwarted his negociation, was Macdonald of Glencoe
whose opposition rose from a private circumstance, which
ought to have had no effect upon a treaty that regarded
the publick weal. Macdonald had plundered the lands of
Breadalbane during the course of hostilities; and this
nobleman insisted upon being indemnified for his losses,
from the other's share of the money which he was em∣ployed
to distribute. The Highlander not only refused to
acquiesce in these terms, but, by his influence among the
clans, defeated the whole scheme, and the Earl in revenge
devoted him to destruction. King William had by pro∣clamation
offered an indemnity to all those who had been
in arms against him, provided they would submit, and
take the oaths, by a certain day; and this was prolonged
to the close of the present year, with a denunciation of
military execution against those who should hold out after
the end of December. Macdonald, intimidated by this
declaration, repaired on the very last day of the month to
Fort-William, and desired that the oaths might be tender∣ed
to him by Colonel Hill, governor of that fortress. As
this officer was not vested with the power of a civil magi∣strate,
he refused to administer them; and Macdonald
set out immediately for Inverary, the county-town of
Argyle. Though the ground was covered with snow,
and the weather intensely cold, he travelled with such
diligence, that the term prescribed by the proclamation
was but one day elapsed when he reached the place, and
addressed himself to Sir John Campbell, sheriff of the
county, who, in consideration of his disappointment at
Fort-William, was prevailed upon to administer the oaths
to him and his adherents. Then they returned to their
own habitations in the valley of Glencoe, in full confi∣dence
of being protected by the government, to which
they had so solemnly submitted.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Breadalbane had represented Macdonald at court
as an incorrigible rebel, as a ruffian inured to bloodshed
and rapine, who would never be obedient to the laws of
his country, nor live peaceably under any sovereign. He
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
observed that he had paid no regard to the proclamation,
and proposed that the government should sacrifice him to
the quiet of the kingdom, in extirpating him, with his
family and dependents, by military execution. His ad∣vice
was supported by the suggestions of the other Scottish
ministers; and the King, whose chief virtue was not hu∣manity,
signed a warrant for the destruction of those un∣happy
people, though it does not appear that he knew of
Macdonald's submission. An order for this barbarous
execution, signed and counter-signed by his Majesty's
own hand, being transmitted to the Master of Stair, secre∣tary
for Scotland, this minister sent particular directions
to Livingstone, who commanded the troops in that king∣dom,
to put the inhabitants of Glencoe to the sword,
charging him to take no prisoners, that the scene might
be more terrible. In the month of February, Captain
Campbell, of Glenlyon, by virtue of an order from
Major Duncanson, marched into the valley of Glencoe,
with a company of soldiers belonging to Argyle's regiment,
on pretence of levying the arrears of the land-tax and
hearth-money. When Macdonald demanded whether
they came as friends or enemies, he answered as friends,
and promised, upon his honour, that neither he nor his
people should sustain the least injury. In consequence of
this declaration, he and his men were received with the
most cordial hospitality, and lived fifteen days with the
men of the valley, in all the appearance of the most unre∣served
friendship. At length the fatal period approached.
Macdonald and Campbell having passed the day together,
parted about seven in the evening, with mutual professions
of the warmest affection. The younger Macdonald, per∣ceiving
the guards doubled, began to suspect some
treachery, and communicated his suspicion to his brother;
but neither he nor the father would harbour the least
doubt of Campbell's sincerity: nevertheless, the two
young men went forth privately, to make further observa∣tions.
They overheard the common soldiers say they
liked not the work; that though they would have wil∣lingly
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
sought the Macdonalds of the Glen fairly in the
field, they held it base to murther them in cool blood,
but that their officers were answerable for the treachery.
When the youths hasted back to apprise their father of
the impending danger, they saw the house already sur∣rounded:
they heard the discharge of muskets, the shrieks
of women and children, and, being destitute of arms,
secured their own lives by immediate flight. The savage
ministers of vengeance had entered the old man's chamber,
and shot him through the head. He fell down dead in
the arms of his wife, who died next day, distracted by
the horror of her husband's fate. The Laird of Auchin∣trincken,
Macdonald's guest, who had three months before
this period submitted to the government, and at this very
time had a protection in his pocket, was put to death
without question. A boy of eight years, who fell at
Campbell's feet, imploring mercy, and offering to serve
him for life, was stabbed to the heart by one Drummond,
a subaltern officer. Eight-and-thirty persons suffered in
this manner, the greater part of whom were surprised in
their beds, and hurried into eternity before they had time
to implore the divine mercy. The design was to butche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the males under seventy that lived in the valley, the
number of whom amounted to two hundred; but some of
the detachments did not arrive soon enough to secure the
passes; so that one hundred and sixty escaped. Campbell
having perpetrated this brutal massacre; ordered all the
houses to be burned, made a prey of all the cattle and
effects that were found in the valley, and left the helpless
women and children, whose fathers and husbands he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
murthered, naked and forlorn, without covering, food
or shelter, in the midst of the snow that covered th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whole face of the country, at the distance of six long
miles from any inhabited place. Distracted with grie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and horror, surrounded with the shades of night, shivering
with cold, and appalled with the apprehension of imme∣diate
death from the swords of those who had sacrifice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their friends and kinsmen, they could not endure such
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
complication of calamities, but generally perished in the
waste, before they could receive the least comfort or assist∣ance.
This barbarous massacre, performed under the
sanction of King William's authority, answered the imme∣diate
purpose of the court, by striking terrour into the
hearts of the Jacobite Highlanders: but, at the same
time, excited the horrour of all those who had not re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounced
every sentiment of humanity, and produced such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n aversion to the government, as all the arts of a mi∣nistry
could never totally surmount. A detail of the par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>culars
was published at Paris, with many exaggerations,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Jacobites did not fail to expatiate upon every
circumstance, in domestic libels and private conversation.
The King alarmed at the outcry which was raised upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his occasion, ordered an enquiry to be set on foot, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ismissed the Master of Stair from his employment of

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho had made his authority subservient to their own cruel
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evenge, the imputation stuck fast to his character, and

were inspired with the most implacable resent∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent

<P>§ XXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1692.</NOTE> A great number in both kingdoms waited im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atiently
for an opportunity to declare in behalf of their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xiled monarch, who was punctually informed of all these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ansactions, and endeavoured to make his advantage of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e growing discontent. King William having settled
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e domestick affairs of the nation, and exerted uncom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on

assiduity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1692.</NOTE> in preparing the nation for his return.
One Lant, who was imprisoned on suspicion of distri∣buting
his commissions, had the good fortune to be re∣leased,
and the papists of Lancashire dispatched him to
the court of St. Germain's, with an assurance that they
were in a condition to receive their old sovereign. He
returned with advice that King James would certainly land
in the spring; and that Colonel Parker and other officers
should be sent over with full instructions, touching their
conduct at and before the King's arrival. Parker accord∣ingly
repaired to England, and made the Jacobites ac∣quainted
with the whole scheme of a descent, which Louis
had actually concerted with the late King. He assured
them, that their lawful sovereign would once more visit
his British dominions, at the head of thirty thousand
effective men, to be embarked at La Hogue; that the
transports were already prepared, and a strong squadron
equipped for their convoy; he, therefore, exhorted them
to be speedy and secret in their preparations, that they
might be in readiness to take arms, and co-operate in ef∣fecting
his restoration. This officer, and one Johnson, a
priest, are said to have undertaken the assassination o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King William; but, before they could execute their de∣sign,
his Majesty set sail for Holland.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Mean while James addressed a letter to several
lords, who had been formerly members of his council, as
well as to divers ladies of quality and distinction, intimating
the pregnancy of his Queen, and requiring them to attend
as witnesses at the labour. He took notice of the injury
his family and honour had sustained, from the crue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
aspersions of his enemies concerning the birth of his son
and as providence had now favoured him with an oppor∣tunity

This invitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1692.</NOTE> however, no person would venture
to accept. He afterwards employed his emissaries in circu∣lating
a printed declaration, importing that the King of
France had enabled him to make another effort to re∣trieve
his crown; that, although he was furnished with a
number of troops sufficient to untie the hands of his sub∣jects,
he did not intend to deprive them of their share
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the glory of restoring their lawful king and their an∣tient
government. He exhorted the people to join his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andard. He assured them that the foreign auxiliaries
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould behave with the most regular discipline, and be sent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack immediately after his re-establishment. He observed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat when such a number of his subjects were so infatuated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to concur with the unnatural design of the Prince of
Orange, he had chosen to rely upon the fidelity of his
English army, and refused considerable succours that were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered to him by his Most Christian Majesty; that when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was ready to oppose force with force, he nevertheless
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered to give all reasonable satisfaction to his subjects
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho had been misled, and endeavoured to open their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes with respect to the vain pretences of his adversary,
whose aim was not the reformation but the subversion of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he government; that when he saw himself deserted by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is army, betrayed by his ministers, abandoned by his fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourites,
and even his own children, and at last rudely
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riven from his own palace by a guard of insolent foreign∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,
he had, for his personal safety, taken refuge in France:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat his retreat from the malice and cruel designs of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surper had been construed into an abdication, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole constitution of the monarchy destroyed by a set of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enillegally assembled, who, in fact, had no power to alter
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
the property of the meanest subject. He expressed his hope
that by this time the nation had fairly examined the ac∣count,
and, from the losses and enormous expense of the
three last years, were convinced that the remedy was
worse than the disease: that the beginning, like the first
years of Nero's reign, would, in all probability, be found
the mildest part of the usurpation, and the instruments
of the new establishment live to suffer severely by the ty∣ranny
they had raised; that even, though the usurpation
should continue during his life, an indisputable title would
survive in his issue, and expose the kingdom to all the mi∣series
of a civil war. He not only solicited, but command∣ed
his good subjects to join him, according to their duty
and the oaths they had taken. He forbade them to pay
taxes or any part of the revenue to the usurper. He pro∣mised
pardon, and even rewards to all those who should
return to their duty, and to procure in his first parlia∣ment
an act of indemnity, with an exception of certain
persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those excepted were the Duke of Ormond, the Marquis of Winchester, the Earls of Sunderland, Bath, Danby, and Nottingham, the Lords New∣port, Delamer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Wiltshire, Colchester, Cornbury, Dunblain, and Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bishops of London and St. Asaph, Sir Robert Howard, Sir John Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den, Sir Samuel Grimstone, Sir Stephen Fox, Sir George Treby, Sir Basil Dix∣well, Sir James Oxenden, Dr. John Tillo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, Dr. Gilbert Burnet; Franci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Russel, Richard Levison, John Trenchard, Charles Duncomb, citizen of London; Edwards, Stapleton, and Hunt, fishermen, and all others who had offered personal indignities to him at Feversham; or had been concerned i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the barbarous murder of John Ashton, Cross, or any others who had suffered death for their loyalty, and all spies, or such as had betrayed his councils du∣ring his absence from England.</NOTE> whom he now enumerated. He declared, that all
soldiers who should quit the service of the usurper, and
inlist under his banners, might depend upon receiving their
pardon and arrears; and that the foreign troops, upon
laying down their arms, should be paid and transported
to their respective countries. He solemnly protested that
he would protect and maintain the church of England,
as by law established, in all her rights, privileges, and
possessions: he signified his resolution to use his influence
with the parliament for allowing liberty of conscience to
all his subjects, as an indulgence agreeable to the spirit of
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
the christian religion and conducive to the wealth and
prosperity of the nation. He said his principal care should
be to heal the wounds of the late distractions; to restore
trade, by observing the act of navigation, which had been
lately so much violated in favour of strangers; to put the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avy in a flourishing condition: and to take every step
that might contribute to the greatness of the monarchy
and the happiness of the people. He concluded with pro∣fessions
of resignation to the divine will, declaring, that
all who should reject his offers of mercy, and appear in
arms against him, would be answerable to Almighty God,
for all the blood that should be spilt, and all the miseries
in which these kingdoms might be involved by their des∣perate
and unreasonable opposition.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. While this declaration operated variously on
the minds of the people, Colonel Parker, with some other
officers, inlisted men privately for the service of James, in
the counties of York, Lancaster, and in the bishoprick of
Durham: at the same time, Fountaine and Holman were
employed in raising two regiments of horse at London,
that they might join their master immediately after his
landing. His partisans sent Captain Lloyd with an ex∣press
to Lord Melfort, containing a detail of these parti∣culars,
with an assurance that they had brought over
Rear-Admiral Carter to the interest of his Majesty. They
likewise transmitted a list of the ships that composed the
English fleet, and exhorted James to use his influence
with the French King, that the Count de Tourville might
be ordered to attack them before they should be joined
by the Dutch squadron. It was in consequence of this advice,
that Louis commanded Tourville to fall upon the English
fleet, even without waiting for the Toulon squadron,
commanded by the Marquis D'Etrees. By this time James
had repaired to La Hogue, and was ready to embark with
his army, consisting of a body of French troops, together
with some English and Scotch refugees, and the regi∣ments
which had been transported from Ireland by vir∣tue
of the capitulation of Limerick.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The ministry of England was informed of all
<PB N="144" REF="148"/>
these particulars, partly by some agents of James, who
betrayed his cause, and partly by Admiral Carter, who
gave the Queen to understand he had been tampered with:
and was instructed to amuse the Jacobites with a negocia∣tion.
King William no sooner arrived in Holland, than
he hastened the naval preparations of the Dutch, so that
their fleet was ready for sea sooner than was expected;
and when he received the first intimation of the projected
descent, he detached General Ptolemache with three of
the English regiments from Holland. These, re-enforced
with other troops remaining in England, were ordered to
encamp in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth. The Queen
issued a proclamation, commanding all papists to depart
from London and Westminster: the members of both
Houses of parliament were required to meet on the twenty-fourth
of May, that she might avail herself of their ad∣vice
in such a perilous conjuncture. Warrants were ex∣pedited
for apprehending divers disaffected persons; and
they withdrawing themselves from their respective places
of abode, a proclamation was published for discovering
and bringing them to justice. The Earls of Scarsdale,
Lichfield, and Newburgh; the Lords Griffin, Forbes,
Sir John Fenwick, Sir Theoph. Oglethorpe, and others,
found means to elude the search. The Earls of Hunting∣don
and Marlborough were sent to the Tower: Edward
Ridley, Knevitt, Hastings, and Robert Ferguson, were
imprisoned in Newgate. The Bishop of Rochester was
confined to his own house: the Lords Brudenell and
Fanshaw were secured: the Earls of Dunmore, Middle∣ton,
and Sir Andrew Forrester were discovered in a qua∣ker's
house, and committed to prison, with several other
persons of distinction. The train-bands of London and
Westminster were armed by the Queen's direction, and
she reviewed them in person: Adm. Russel was ordered
to put to sea with all possible expedition; and Carter, with
a squadron of eighteen sail, continued to cruise along th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
French coast, to observe the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. On the eleventh day of May, Russel saile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from Rye to St. Helen's, where he was joined by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
squadrons under Delaval and Carter. There he received
a letter from the Earl of Nottingham, intimating, that a
report having spread of the Queen's suspecting the fidelity
of the sea-officers, her Majesty had ordered him to decare
in her name, that she reposed the most entire confidence
in their attachment; and believed the report was raised
by the enemies of the government. The flag-officers
and captains forthwith drew up a very loyal and dutiful
address, which was graciously received by the Queen, and
published for the satisfaction of the nation. Russel, being
re-enforced by the Dutch squadrons, commanded by
Allemonde, Callembergh, and Vandergoes, set sail for the
coast of France on the eighteenth day of May, with a
fleet of ninety-nine ships of the line, besides frigates and
fire-ships. Next day, about three o'clock in the morn∣ing,
he discovered the enemy, under the Count de Tour∣ville,
and threw out the signal for the line of battle, which
by eight o'clock was formed in good order, the Dutch in
the van, the blue division in the rear, and the red in the
centre. The French fleet did not exceed sixty-three ships
of the line, and, as they were to windward, Tourville
might have avoided an engagement: but, he had received
a positive order to fight, on the supposition that the Dutch
and English squadrons had not joined. Louis, indeed,
was apprised of their junction before they were descried by
his admiral, to whom he dispatched a countermanding
order by two several vessels: but, one of them was taken
by the English, and the other did not arrive till the day
after the engagement.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. Tourville, therefore, in obedience to the
first mandate, bore down along side of Russel's own ship,
which he engaged at a very small distance. He fought
with great fury till one o'clock, when his rigging and sails
being considerably damaged, his ship, the Rising-Sun,
which carried one hundred and four cannon, was towed
out of the line in great disorder. Nevertheless, the en∣gagement
continued till three, when the fleets were parted
by a thick fog. When this abated, the enemy were
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
descried flying to the northward; and Russel made the
signal for chasing. Part of the blue squadron came up
with the enemy about eight in the evening, and engaged
them half an hour, during which Admiral Carter was
mortally wounded. Finding himself in extremity, he
exhorted his captain to fight as long as the ship could
swim; and expired with great composure. At length,
the French bore away for Conquet-Road, having lost four
ships in this day's action. Next day, about eight in the
morning, they were discovered crowding away to the west∣ward,
and the combined fleets chased with all the sail
they could carry, until Russel's foretop-mast came by the
board. Though he was retarded by this accident, the
fleet still continued the pursuit, and anchored near Cape
La Hogue. On the twenty-second of the month, about
seven in the morning, part of the French fleet was per∣ceived
near the Race of Alderney, some at anchor, and
some driving to the eastward with the tide of flood. Rus∣sel,
and the ships nearest him, immediately slipped their
cables and chased. The Royal-Sun, having lost her
masts, ran ashore near Cherbourg, where she was burned
by Sir Ralph Delaval, together with the Admirable,
another first-rate, and the Conquerant of eighty guns.
Eighteen other ships of their fleet ran into La Hogue,
where they were attacked by Sir George Rooke, who de∣stroyed
them, and a great number of transports laden
with ammunition, in the midst of a terrible fire from the
enemy, and in fight of the Irish camp. Sir John Ashby,
with his own squadron and some Dutch ships, pursued
the rest of the French fleet, which escaped through the
Race of Alderney, by such a dangerous passage as the
English could not attempt, without exposing their ships to
the most imminent hazard. This was a very mortifying
defeat to the French King, who had been so long
flattered with an uninterrupted series of victories: it re∣duced
James to the lowest ebb of despondence, as it
frustrated the whole scheme of his embarkation, and over∣whelmed
his friends in England with grief and despair.
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>
Some historians alledge, that Russel did not improve his
victory with all advantages that might have been obtained,
before the enemy recovered of their consternation. They
say, his affection to the service was in a good measure
cooled by the disgrace of his friend, the Earl of Marlbo∣rough:
that he hated the Earl of Nottingham, by whose
canal he received his orders; and, that he adhered to the
letter, rather than to the spirit of his instructions. But
this is a malicious imputation; and a very ungrateful re∣turn
for his manifold services to the nation. He acted in
this whole expedition with the genuine spirit of a British
admiral. He plyed from the Nore to the Downs with a
very scanty wind, through the dangerous sands, contrary
to the advice of all his pilots; and by this bold passage
effected a junction of the different squadrons, which other∣wise
the French would have attacked singly and perhaps
defeated. He behaved with great gallantry during the
engagement; and destroyed about fifteen of the enemy's
capital ships: in a word, he obtained such a decisive
victory, that during the remaining part of the war, the
French would not hazard another battle by sea with the
English.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Russel having ordered Sir John Ashby
and the Dutch Admiral Callembergh, to steer towards
Havre de Grace, and endeavour to destroy the remainder
of the French fleet, sailed back to St. Helen's, that the
damaged ships might be resitted, and the fleet furnished
with fresh supplies of provision and ammunition: but his
principal motive was, to take on board a number of troops
provided for a descent upon France, which had been projected
by England and Holland, with a view to alarm and distract
the enemy in their own dominions. The Queen was so
pleased with the victory, that she ordered thirty thousand
pounds to be distributed among the sailors. She caused
medals to be struck in honour of the action; and the
bodies of Admiral Carter and Captain Hastings, who had
been killed in the battle, to be interred with great funeral
pomp. In the latter end of July, seven thousand men,
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>
commanded by the Duke of Leinster, embarked on board
transports, to be landed at St. Maloes, Brest, or Roche∣fort;
and the nation conceived the most sanguine hopes
of this expedition. A council of war, consisting of land
and sea-officers, being held on board the Breda, to delibe∣rate
upon the scheme of the ministry, the members unani∣mously
agreed, that the season was too far advanced to put
it in execution. Nevertheless, the Admiral having detached
Sir John Ashby with a squadron, to intercept the remains
of the French fleet, in their passage from St. Maloes to
Brest, set sail for La Hogue with the rest of the fleet and
transports: but, in a few days, the wind shifting, he was
obliged to return to St. Helen's.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The Queen immediately dispatched the Mar∣quis
of Caermarthen, the Earls of Devonshire, Dorset,
Nottingham, and Rochester, together with the Lords
Sidney and Cornwallis, to consult with the Admiral, who
demonstrated the impracticability of making an effectual
descent upon the coast of France at that season of the year.
The design was, therefore, laid aside; and the forces were
transported to Flanders. The higher the hopes of the
nation had been raised by this armament, the deeper they
felt their disappointment. A loud clamour was raised
against the ministry, as the authors of this miscarriage.
The people complained, that they were plundered and
abused: that immense sums were extorted from them by
the most grievous impositions: that by the infamous ex∣pedient
of borrowing upon established funds, their taxes
were perpetuated: that their burthens would daily in∣crease:
that their treasure was either squandered away in
chimerical projects, or expended in foreign connexions,
of which England was naturally independent. They were
the more excusable for exclaming in this manner, as their
trade had suff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red grievously by the French privateers,
which swarmed in the channel. In vain the merchants
had recourse to the Admiralty, which could not spare par∣ticular
convoys, while large fleets were required for the
defence of the nation. The French King, having nothing
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>
further to apprehend from the English armament, with∣drew
his troops from the coast of Normandy; and James
returned in despair to St. Germain's, where his Queen
had been in his absence delivered of a daughter, who was
born in presence of the Archbishop of Paris, the
Keeper of the Seals, and other persons of distinction.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Louis had taken the field in the latter end of
May. On the twentieth day of that month he arrived at
his camp in Flanders, with all the effeminate pomp of an
Asiatick emperor, attended by his women and parasites,
his band of musick, his dancers, his opera, and, in a word,
by all the ministers of luxury and sensual pleasure. Hav∣ing
reviewed his army, which amounted to about one
hundred and twenty thousand men, he undertook the siege
of Namur, which he invested on both sides of the Sambre,
with about one half of his army, while the other covered
the siege, under the command of Luxembourg. Namur
is situated on the conflux of the Meuse and the Sambre.
The citadel was deemed one of the strongest sorts in
Flanders, strengthened with a new work contrived by the
famous engineer Coehorn, who now defended it in person.
The Prince de Barbason commanded the garrison, con∣sisting
of nine thousand men. The place was well sup∣plied;
and the governor knew that King William would
make strong efforts for its relief: so that the besieged
were animated with many concurring considerations.
Notwithstanding these advantages, the assailants carried on
their attacks with such vigour, that in seven days after
the trenches were opened the town capitulated, and the
garrison retired into the citadel. King William, being
joined by the troops of Brandenburgh and Liege, advanced
to the Mehaigne, at the head of one hundred thousand ef∣fective
men, and encamped within cannon-shot of Lux∣embourg's
army, which lay on the other side of the river.
That general, however, had taken such precautions, that
the King of England could not interrupt the siege, nor
attack the French lines without great disadvantage. The
besiegers, encouraged by the presence of their monarch,
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>
and assisted by the superior abilities of Vauban their engi∣neer,
repeated their attacks with such impetuosity, that
the fort of Coehorn was surrendered, after a very obstinate
defence, in which he himself had been dangerously
wounded. The citadel being thus left exposed to the
approaches of the enemy, could not long withstand the
violence of their operations. The two covered-ways were
taken by assault: on the twentieth of May the governor
capitulated, to the unspeakable mortification of King Wil∣liam,
who saw himself obliged to lie inactive at the head
of a powerful army, and be an eye witness of the loss of
the most important fortress in the Netherlands. Louis,
having taken possession of the place, returned in triumph
to Versailles, where he was flattered with all the arts of
adulation; while William's reputation suffered a little
from his miscarriage, and the Prince of Barbason incurred
the suspicion of treachery or misconduct.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Luxembourg having placed a strong garrison
in Namur, detached Boufflers with a body of troops to
La Bussiere, and with the rest of his army encamped at
Soignies. The King of England sent off detachments
towards Liege and Ghent; and on the sixth day of July
posted himself at Genap, resolved to seize the first oppor∣tunity
of retrieving his honour, by attacking the enemy.
Having received intelligence that the French general was
in motion, and intended to take post between Steenkerke
and Enghien, he passed the river Senne, in order to antici∣pate
his purpose: but, in spite of all his diligence, Lux∣embourg
gained his point; and William encamped at
Lembecq, within six miles of the French army. Here he
resolved, in a council of war, to attack the enemy; and
every disposition was made for that purpose. The heavy
baggage he ordered to be conveyed to the other side of the
Senne; and one Millevoix, a detected spy, was compelled
by menaces to mislead Luxembourg with false intelligence,
importing, that he need not be alarmed at the motions of
the allies, who intended next day to make a general forage.
On the twenty-fourth day of July, the army began to
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
move from the left, in two columns, as the ground would
not admit of their marching in an extended front. The
Prince of Wirtemberg began the attack on the right of
the enemy, at the head of ten battalions of English, Da∣nish,
and Dutch infantry: he was supported by a con∣siderable
body of British horse and foot, commanded by
Lieutenant-General Mackay. Though the ground was
intersected by hedges, ditches, and narrow defiles, the
Prince marched with such diligence, that he was in a
condition to begin the battle about two in the after∣noon,
when he charged the French with such impetu∣osity,
that they were driven from their posts, and their
whole camp became a scene of tumult and confusion.
Luxembourg, trusting to the intelligence he had received,
allowed himself to be surprised; and it required the full
exertion of his superior talents, to remedy the consequences
of his neglect. He forthwith forgot a severe indisposition
under which he then laboured; he rallied his broken
battalions: he drew up his forces in order of battle, and
led them to the charge in person. The Duke de Chartres,
who was then in the fifteenth year of his age, the Dukes
of Bourbon and Vendome, the Prince of Conti, and a
great number of volunteers of the first quality, put them∣selves
at the head of the household troops, and fell with
great fury upon the English, who were very ill supported
by Count Solmes, the officer who commanded the centre
of the allies. The Prince of Wirtemberg had taken one
of the enemy's batteries, and actually penetrated into their
lines: but finding himself in danger of being overpowered
by numbers, he sent an aide-du-camp twice, to demand
succours from Solmes, who derided his distress, saying,
“Let us see what sport these English bull-dogs will
make.” At length, when the King sent an express
order, commanding him to sustain the left wing, he made
a motion with his horse, which could not act while his
infantry kept their ground; and the British troops, with
a few Dutch and Danes, bore the whole brunt of the en∣gagement.
They fought with surprising courage and
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>
perseverance against dreadful odds; and the event of the
battle continued doubtful, until Boufflers joined the
French army with a great body of dragoons. The allies
could not sustain the additional weight of this re-enforce∣ment,
before which they gave way, though the retreat
was made in tolerable order; and the enemy did not
think proper to prosecute the advantage they had gained.
In this action the confederates lost the Earl of Angus,
General Mackay, Sir John Lanier, Sir Robert Douglas,
and many other gallant officers, together with about three
thousand men left dead on the spot, the same number
wounded or taken, a great many colours and standards,
and several pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The French, however, reaped no solid ad∣vantage
from this victory, which cost them about three
thousand men, including the Prince of Turenne, the
Marquis de Bellefonds, Tilladet, and Fermaçon, with
many officers of distinction: as for Millevoix the spy, he
was hanged on a tree, on the right wing of the allied
army. King William retired unmolested to his own
camp; and, notwithstanding all his overthrows, continued
a respectable enemy, by dint of invincible fortitude, and
a genius fruitful in resources. That he was formidable to
the French nation, even in the midst of his ill success,
appears from divers undeniable testimonies, and from none
more than from the extravagance of joy expressed by the
people of France, on occasion of this unimportant victory.
When the princes who served in the battle returned to
Paris, the roads through which they passed were almost
blocked up with multitudes; and the whole air resounded
with acclamation. All the ornaments of the fashion pe∣culiar
to both sexes adopted the name of Steenkerke:
every individual who had been personally engaged in the
action was revered as a being of a superior species; and the
transports of the women rose almost to a degree of frenzy.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The French ministry did not entirely de∣pend
upon the fortune of the war for the execution of
their revenge against King William. They likewise em∣ployed
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>
assassins to deprive him of life, in the most trea∣cherous
manner. When Louvois died, his son, the Marquis
de Barbesieux, who succeeded him in his office of secre∣tary,
found, among his papers, the draft of a scheme for
this purpose, and immediately revived the design, by means
of the Chevalier de Grandval, a captain of dragoons in
the service. He and Colonel Parker engaged one Du∣mont,
who undertook to assassinate King William. Ma∣dame
de Maintenon, and Paparel, paymaster to the French
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy, were privy to the scheme, which they encouraged:
the conspirators are said to have obtained an audience of
King James, who approved of their undertaking, and as∣sured
them of his protection; but that unfortunate mo∣narch
was unjustly charged with the guilt of countenan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
the intended murder, as they communicated nothing
to him but an attempt to seize the person of the Prince of
Orange. Dumont actually enlisted in the confederate ar∣my,
that he might have the better opportunity to shoot
the King of England when he should ride out to visit the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines, while Grandval and Parker repaired to the French
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amp, with orders to Luxembourg, to furnish them with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> party of horse for the rescue of Dumont, after the blow
should be struck. Whether this man's heart failed him,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he could not find the opportunity he desired, after ha∣ving
resided some weeks in the camp of the allies, he re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired
to Hanover; but still corresponded with Grandval
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Barbesieux. This last admitted one Leefdale, a Dutch
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aron, into the secret, and likewise imparted it to Mon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur
Chanlais, quarter master-general of the French army,
who animated Grandval and Leefdale with the promise of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> considerable reward, and promised to co-operate with
Parker for bringing off Dumont, for this assassin still per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isted
in his undertaking. Leefdale had been sent from
Holland, on purpose to dive to the bottom of this con∣spiracy,
in consequence of advice given by the British en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy
at Hanover, where Dumont had dropped some hints
that alarmed his suspicion. The Dutchman not only in∣sinuated
himself into the considence of the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirators,
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
but likewise inveigled Grandval to Eyndhoven, where he
was apprehended. Understanding that Dumont had al∣ready
discovered the design to the Duke of Zell, and that
he himself had been betrayed by Leefdale, he freely con∣fessed
all the particulars, without enduring the torture;
and, being found guilty by a court-martial, was executed
as a traitor.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. About this period the Duke of Leinster arrived
at Ostend, with the troops which had been embarked at St.
Helen's. He was furnished with cannon sent down the
Meuse from Maestricht; and re-enforced by a large de∣tachment
from the King's camp at Gramont, under the
command of General Ptolemache. He took possession of
Furnes, was joined by the Earl of Portland and M. D' Au∣verquerque,
and a disposition was made for investing
Dunkirk; but, on further deliberation, the enterprize
was thought very dangerous, and therefore laid aside.
Furnes and Dixmuyde, lately reduced by Brigadier Ram∣say,
were strengthened with new works, and secured by
strong garrisons. The cannon were sent back, and the
troops returning to Ostend, re-embarked for England.
This fruitless expedition, added to the inglorious issue of
the campaign, increased the ill humour of the British
nation. They taxed William with having lain inactive
at Gramont with an army of one hundred thousand men,
while Luxembourg was posted at Courtray with half that
number. They said, if he had found the French lines too
strong to be forced, he might have passed the Scheld
higher up, and not only laid the enemy's conquests under
contribution, but even marched into the bowels of France;
and they complained that Furnes and Dixmuyde were not
worth the sums expended in maintaining their garrisons.
On the twenty-sixth day of September King William left
the army under the command of the Elector of Bavaria,
and repaired to his house at Loo; in two days after his
departure the camp at Gramont was broke up; the infan∣try
marched to Marienkirke, and the horse to Gaure. On
the sixteenth day of October, the King receiving intelli∣gence,
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
that Boufflers had invested Charleroy, and Luxem∣bourg
taken post in the neighbourhood of Conde, ordered
the troops to be instanty reassembled between the village
of Ixells and Halle, with design to raise the siege, and
repaired to Brussels, where he held a council of war, in
which the proper measures were concerted. He then re∣turned
to Holland, leaving the command with the Elector
of Bavaria, who forthwith began his march to Charleroy.
At his approach Boufflers abandoned the siege, and moved
towards Philipville. The Elector having re-enforced the
place, and thrown supplies into Aeth, distributed his for∣ces
into winter-quarters. Then Luxembourg, who had
cantoned his army between Conde, Leuze, and Tournay,
returned to Paris, leaving Boufflers to command in his
absence.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The allies had been unsuccessful in Flanders,
and they were not fortunate in Germany. The Land∣grave
of Hesse-Cassel undertook the siege of Eberemburgh,
which, however, he was obliged to abandon. The Duke
de Lorges, who commanded the French forces on the
Rhine, surprised, defeated, and took the Duke of Wir∣temberg,
who had posted himself with four thousand horse
near Eidelsheim, to check the progress of the enemy.
Count Tallard having invested Rhinefeld, the Landgrave
marched to its relief with such expedition, that the French
were obliged to desist, and retreat with considerable da∣mage.
The Elector of Saxony had engaged to bring an
army into the field; but, he complained that the Emperor
left the burthen of the war with France upon the princes,
and converted his chief power and attention to the cam∣paign
in Hungary. A jealousy and misunderstanding en∣sued:
Schoening, the Saxon general, in his way to the
hot-baths at Dablitz in Bohemia, was seized by the Em∣peror's
order, on suspicion of having maintained a private
correspondence with the enemy, and very warm expostu∣lations
on this subject passed between the courts of Vienna
and Dresden. Schoening was detained two years in
custody; and at length released, on condition that he
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>
should never be employed again in the empire. The wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in Hungary produced no event of importance. The mi∣nistry
of the Ottoman Porte was distracted by factions, and
the seraglio threatened with tumults. The people were
tired of maintaining an unsuccessful war: the Visir wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
deposed; and, in the midst of this confusion, the garri∣son
of great Waradin, which had been blocked up by the
Imperialists during the whole winter, surrendered on capitu∣lation.
Lord Paget, the English ambassador at Vienna, was
sent to Constantinople, with powers to mediate a peace
but the terms offered by the Emperor were rejected a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Porte: the Turkish army lay upon the defensive▪
and the season was spent in a fruitless negociation.</P>
<P>XXXVI. The prospect of affairs in Piedmont was fa∣vourable
for the allies; but the court of France had
brought the Pope to an accommodation, and began to
tamper with the Duke of Savoy. M. Chanlais was sent
to Turin, with advantageous proposals, which, however,
the Duke would not accept, because he thought himself
entitled to better terms, considering that the allied army
in Piedmont amounted to fifty thousand effective men,
while Catinat's forces were not sufficient to defend his
conquests in that country. In the month of July the
Duke marched into Dauphine, where he plundered a
number of villages, and reduced the fortress of Guillestre;
then passing the river Darance, he invested Ambrun,
which, after a siege of nine days, surrendered on capitu∣lation:
He afterwards laid all the neighbouring towns un∣der
contribution. Here Duke Schomberg, who com∣manded
the auxiliaries in the English pay, published a de∣claration,
in the name of King William, inviting the peo∣ple
to join his standard, assuring them that his master had
no other design in ordering his troops to invade France,
but that of restoring the noblesse to their ancient splen∣dour,
their parliaments to their former authority, and the
people to their just privileges. He even offered his pro∣tection
to the clergy, and promised to use his endeavours
for reviving the edict of Nantes, which had been guaranteed
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
by the Kings of England. These offers, however, pro∣duced
little effect; and the Germans ravaged the whole
country, in revenge for the cruelties which the French
had committed in the Palatinate. The allied army ad∣vanced
from Ambrun to Gap, on the frontiers of Pro∣vence,
and this place submitted without opposition. The
inhabitants of Grenoble, the capital of Dauphine, and
even of Lyons, were overwhelmed with consternation;
and a fairer opportunity of humbling France could never
occur, as that part of the kingdom had been left almost
quite defenceless: but this was fatally neglected, either
from the spirit of dissention which began to prevail in the
allied army, or from the indisposition of the Duke of
Savoy, who was seised with the small-pox in the midst of
this expedition; or, lastly, to his want of sincerity, which
was shrewdly suspected. He is said to have maintained a
constant correspondence with the court of Versailles, in
complaisance to which he retarded the operations of the
confederates. Certain it is, he evacuated all his conquests,
and about the middle of September quitted the French ter∣ritories,
after having pillaged and laid waste the country
through which he had penetrated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this period Queen Mary, understanding that the protestant Vaudo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere destitute of ministers to preach or teach the gospel, established a fund from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er own privy purse, to maintain ten preachers, and as many schoolmasters, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the vallies of Piedmont.</NOTE>. In Catalonia the
French attempted nothing of importance during this
campaign, and the Spaniards were wholly inactive in that
province.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The protestant interest in Germany ac∣quired
an accession of strength, by the creation of a ninth
electorate in favour of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Hanover.
He had, by this time, renounced all his connexions with
France, and engaged to enter heartily into the interest of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he allies, in consideration of his obtaining the electoral

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is behalf at the court of Vienna, that the Emperor agreed

<PB N="158" REF="162"/>
could be procured. This assent, however, was extorted
by the importunities of the King of England, whom he
durst not disoblige. Leopold was blindly bigotted to the
religion of Rome, and consequently averse to a new crea∣tion,
that would weaken the catholick interest in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
electoral college. He, therefore, employed his emissarie
to thwart the Duke's measures. Some protestant prince
opposed him from motives of jealousy, and the French
King used all his artifices and influence, to prevent th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
elevation of the House of Hanover. When the Duke ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
surmounted all his opposition, so far as to gain over

<P><PB N="160" REF="164"/>
§I WHILE King William seemed wholly engrossed
by the affairs of the continent, England was
distracted by domestick dissention, and overspread with
vice, corruption, and profanity. Over and above the
Jacobites, there was a set of malcontents, whose number
daily increased. They not only murmured at the griev∣ances
of the nation, but composed and published elabo∣rate
dissertations upon the same subject. These made such
impressions upon the people, already irritated by heavy
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>
burthens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1692.</NOTE> distressed in their trade, and disappointed in
their sanguine expectations, that the Queen thought it
necessary to check the progress of those writers, by issuing
out a proclamation, offering a reward to such as would
discover seditious libellers. The Earl of Marlborough
had been committed to the Tower, on the information of
one Robert Young, a prisoner in Newgate, who had
forged that nobleman's hand-writing, and contrived the
scheme of an association in favour of King James, to
which he affixed the names of the Earls of Marlborough
and Salisbury, Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, the Lord
Cornbury, and Sir Basil Firebrace. One of his emissa∣ries
had found means to conceal this paper in a certain
part of the Bishop's house at Bromley in Kent, where it
was found by the King's messengers, who secured the
prelate in consequence of Young's information. But he
vindicated himself to the satisfaction of the whole council,
and the forgery of the informer was detected by the con∣fession
of his accomplice. The Bishop obtained his re∣lease
immediately, and the Earl of Marlborough was ad∣mitted
to bail in the court of King's-Bench.</P>
<P>§ II. So many persons of character and distinction had
been imprisoned during this reign, upon the slightest sus∣picion,
that the discontented part of the nation had some
reason to insinuate, they had only exchanged one tyrant
for another. They affirmed, that the Habeas Corpus act
was either insufficient to protect the subject from false
imprisonment, or had been shamefully misused. They
expatiated upon the loss of ships, which had lately fallen
a prey to the enemy; the consumption of seamen; the
neglect of the fisheries; the interruption of commerce, in
which the nation was supplanted by her allies, as well as
invaded by her enemies; the low ebb of the kingdom's
treasure exhausted in hiring foreign bottoms, and paying
foreign troops to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight foreign quarrels; and the slaughter
of the best and bravest of their countrymen, whose blood
had been lavishly spilt in support of connexions with which
they ought to have had no concern. They demonstrated
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
the mischiefs that necessarily arose from the unsettled state
of the nation. They observed that the government could
not be duely established, until a solemn declaration should
confirm the legality of that tenure by which their Majesties
possessed the throne; that the structure of parliaments was
deficient in point of solidity, as they existed entirely at the
pleasure of the crown, which would use them no longer
than they should be found necessary in raising supplies for
the use of the government. They exclaimed against the
practice of quartering soldiers in private houses, contrary
to the ancient laws of the land, the petition of rights, and
the subsequent act on that subject passed in the reign of
the second Charles. They enumerated among their
grievances the violation of property, by pressing transport
ships into the service, without settling any fund of pay∣ment
for the owners; the condition of the militia, which
was equally burthensome and useless; the flagrant partia∣lity
in favour of allies, who carried on an open commerce
with France, and supplied the enemy with necessaries,
while the English laboured under the severest prohibitions
and were in effect the dupes of those very powers whom
they protected. They dwelt upon the ministry's want of
conduct, foresight, and intelligence, and inveighed against
their ignorance, insolence, and neglect, which were as
pernicious to the nation as if they had formed a design of
reducing it to the lowest ebb of disgrace and destruction.
By this time, indeed, publick virtue was become the
object of ridicule, and the whole kingdom was overspread
with immorality and corruption; towards the increase of
which many concurring circumstances happened to con∣tribute.
The people were divided into three parties,
namely, the Williamites, the Jacobites, and the discon∣tented
Revolutioners: these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actions took all opportu∣nities
to thwart, to expose, and to ridicule the measures
and principles of each other; so that patriotism was laughed
out of doors, as an hypocritical pretence. This conten∣tion
established a belief, that every man consulted his own
private interest at the expense of the publick: a belief that
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
soon grew into a maxim almost universally adopted. The
practice of bribing a majority in parliament had a perni∣cious
influence upon the morals of all ranks of people,
from the candidate to the lowest borough-elector. The
expedient of establishing funds of credit for raising supplies
to defray the expenses of government, threw large pre∣miums
and sums of money into the hands of low, sordid
usurers, brokers, and jobbers, who distinguished them∣selves
by the name of the Monied-interest. Intoxicated by
this flow of wealth, they affected to rival the luxury and
magnificence of their superiors; but, being destitute of
sentiment and taste, to conduct them in their new career,
they ran into the most absurd and illiberal extravagancies.
They laid aside all decorum; became lewd, insolent,
intemperate, and riotous. Their example was caught by
the vulgar. All principle, and even decency, was gra∣dually
banished; talent lay uncultivated, and the land
was deluged with a tide of ignorance and profligacy.</P>
<P>§ III. King William having ascertained the winter-quarters
of the army, and concerted the operations of the
ensuing campaign with the States-General, and the mi∣nisters
of the allies, set sail for England on the fifteenth
day of October; on the eighteenth landed at Yarmouth,
was met by the Queen at Newhall, and passed through
the city of London to Kensington, amidst the acclama∣tions
of the populace. He received a congratulatory ad∣dress
from the Lord-Mayor and Aldermen, with whom he
dined in publick by invitation. A day of thanksgiving
was appointed for the victory obtained at sea. The lute∣string
company was established by patent, and the parlia∣ment
met on the fourth day of November. The House of
Lords was deeply infected with discontent, which in some
measure proceeded from the dissention between the Queen
and her sister the Princess of Denmark, which last under∣went
every mortification that the court could inflict. Her
guards were taken away; all honours which had been
paid to her rank by the magistrates of Bath, where she
sometimes resided, and even by the ministers of the church
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
where she attended at divine service, were discontinued,
by the express order of his Majesty. Her cause was natu∣rally
espoused by those noblemen who had adhered to her
in her former contest with the King, about an inde∣pendent
settlement; and these were now re-enforced by
all the friends of the Earl of Marlborough, united by a
double tie; for they resented the disgrace and confine∣ment
of that lord, and thought it their duty to support the
Princess Anne under a persecution incurred by an attach∣ment
to his countess. The Earl of Shrewsbury lived in
friendship with Marlborough, and thought he had been
ungratefully treated by the King: the Marquis of Hallifax
befriended him, from opposition to the ministry: the Earl
of Mulgrave, for an opportunity to display his talents, and
acquire that consideration which he thought due to his
merit. Devonshire, Montague, and Bradford, joined in
the same cause from principle: the same pretence was
used by the Earls of Stamford, Monmouth, War∣rington,
and other Whigs; though in effect they were
actuated by jealousy and resentment against those by whom
they had been supplanted. As for the Jacobites, they
gladly contributed their assistance to promote any scheme
that had a tendency to embroil the administration.</P>
<P>§ IV. The King, in his speech to parliament, thanked
them for their last supplies, congratulated them upon the
victory obtained at sea, condoled them on the bad success
of the campaign by land, magnified the power of France,
represented the necessity of maintaining a great force to
oppose it, and demanded subsidies equal to the occasion.
He expressed his reluctance to load them with additional
burthens, which, he said, could not be avoided, without
exposing his kingdom to inevitable destruction. He desired
their advice towards lessening the inconvenience of ex∣porting
money for the payment of the forces. He inti∣mated
a design of making a descent upon France; declared
he had no aim but to make his subjects a happy people;
and that he would again chearfully expose his life for the
welfare of the nation. The Lords, after an adjournment
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>
of three days, began, with great warmth, to assert their
privileges, which they conceived had been violated in the
cases of the Earl of Marlborough, and the other noble∣men,
who had been apprehended, committed to prison,
and afterwards admitted to bail by the court of King's-Bench.
These circumstances being fully discussed in a
violent debate, the House ordered Lord Lucas, Constable
of the Tower, to produce the warrants of commitment,
and the clerk of the King's-Bench to deliver the affidavit
of Aaron Smith, the court-sollicitor, upon which the
lords had been remanded to prison. At the same time,
the whole affair was referred to a committee, empowered
to send for persons, papers, and records. The judges
were ordered to attend: Aaron Smith was examined,
touching the evidence against the committed lords. The
committee reported their general resolution, which pro∣duced
a vehement dispute. The opinion of the judges was
unsatisfactory to both parties: the debate was referred to
a committee of the whole house, in which it was resolved,
and declared, as the sense of that assembly, that in pursu∣ance
of the Habeas-Corpus act, it was the duty of the
judges and jail-delivery to discharge the prisoner on bail,
if committed for high-treason, unless it be made appear,
upon oath, that there are two witnesses against the said
prisoner, who cannot be produced in that term, session,
or general jail-delivery. They likewise resolved it was
the intention of the said statute, that in case there should
be more than one prisoner to be bailed or remanded, there
must be oath made that there are two witnesses against
each prisoner, otherwise he cannot be remanded to prison.
These resolutions were entered in the books, as standing
directions to all future judges, yet not without great oppo∣sition
from the court-members. The next debate turned
upon the manner in which the imprisoned lords should be
set at liberty. The contest became so warm, that the
courtiers began to be afraid, and proposed an expedient,
which was put in practice. The House adjourned to the
seventeenth day of the month, and at its next meeting
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
was given to understand, that the King had discharged
the imprisoned noblemen. After another warm debate, a
formal entry was made in the journals, importing, That
the House being informed of his Majesty's having given
directions for discharging the lords under bail in the King's
Bench, the debate about that matter ceased. The resent∣ment
of the peers being thus allayed, they proceeded to
take his Majesty's speech into consideration.</P>
<P>§ V. The Commons having voted an address of thanks,
and another, praying that his Majesty's foreign alliances
should be laid before them, determined on a bill for regu∣lating
tryals in cases of high treason. They passed a vote
of thanks to Admiral Russel, his officers and seamen, for
the victory they had obtained, and then proceeded to an
enquiry, Why that victory had not been pursued? Why
the descent had not been made? And why the trade had
not been better protected from the enemy's cruisers? The
Admiral having justified his own conduct, they commanded
the Lords of the Admiralty to produce copies of all the
letters and orders which had been sent to the Admiral:
they ordered Russel to lay before them his answers; and
the commissioners of the transports, victuallers, and Office
of Ordnance, to deliver in an account of their proceedings.
Then they presented addresses to the King and Queen,
acknowledging the favour of God in restoring him to his
people; congratulating him upon his deliverance from the
snares of his open and secret enemies; and assuring him
they would, according to his Majesty's desire in his most
gracious speech, be always ready to advise and assist him
in the support of his government. The Queen was
thanked for her gracious and prudent administration during
his Majesty's absence: they congratulated her on their
signal deliverance from a bold and cruel design formed for
their destruction, as well as on the glorious victory which
her sleet had gained; and they assured her that the grate∣ful
sense they had of their happiness under her govern∣ment,
should always be manifested in constant returns of
duty and obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171"/>
§ VI. After this formal compliment, the House, instead
of proceeding to the supplies, insisted upon perusing the
treaties, publick accounts, and estimates, that they
might be in a condition to advise, as well as to assist his
Majesty. Being indulged with those papers, they passed
a previous vote, that a supply should be given: then they
began to concert their articles of advice. Some of the
members loudly complained of partiality to foreign generals,
and particularly reflected upon the insolence of Count
Solmes, and his misconduct at Steenkerke. After some
warm altercation, the House resolved one article of their
advice should be, That his Majesty would be pleased to fill
up the vacancies that should happen among the general
officers, with such only as were natives of his dominions,
and that the commander in chief of the English should be
an Englishman. Their next resolution implied, That
many of the great affairs of the government having been
for some time past unsuccessfully managed, the House
should advise his Majesty to prevent such mischiefs for the
future, by employing men of knowledge, ability, and
integrity. Individual members inveighed bitterly against
cabinet councils, as a novelty in the British system of
government, by which the privy-council was jostled out
of its province. They complained that all the grievances
of the nation proceeded from the vicious principles of the
ministry: they observed, that he who opposed the esta∣blishment
could not be expected to support it with zeal.
The Earl of Nottingham was mentioned by name, and
the House resolved that his Majesty should be advised to
employ in his councils such persons only whose principles
obliged them to support his rights against the late King,
and all other pretenders. Marlborough's interest still pre∣dominated
among the Commons. His friend Russel ac∣quitted
himself to the satisfaction of the House, and shifted
the blame of the miscarriage upon his enemy the Earl of
Nottingham, by declaring that twenty days elapsed be∣tween
his first letter to that nobleman and his lordship's
answer. The Earl's friends, of whom there was a great
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>
number in the House, espoused his cause with great vi∣gour,
and even recriminated upon Russel; so that a very
violent debate ensued. Both parties agreed that there had
been mismanagement in the scheme of a descent. It was
moved, that one cause of the miscarriage was the want of
giving timely and necessary orders, by those to whom the
management of the affair was committed. The House
divided, and it was carried in the affirmative by one voice
only. At the next sitting of the committee, Sir Richard
Temple proposed they should consider how to pay the
forces abroad, by means of English manufactures, with∣out
exporting money. They resolved that the House
should be moved to appoint a committee to take this expe∣dient
into consideration. Sir Francis Winnington was
immediately called upon to leave the chair, and the
Speaker resumed his place. All that had been done was
now void, as no report had been made; and the com∣mittee
was dissolved. The House, however, revived it,
and appointed a day for its sitting; but, before it could
resume its deliberations, Admiral Russel moved for its
being adjourned, and all its purposes were defeated.</P>
<P>§ VII. The court agents had by this time interposed,
and secured a majority by the infamous arts of corruption.
The Commons no longer insisted upon their points of ad∣vice.
Their whole attention was now centered in the
article of assistance. They granted about two millions
for the maintenance of three-and-thirty thousand seamen,
the building of some additional ships of war, and the
finishing of Plymouth-dock; and seven hundred and fifty
thousand pounds to supply the deficiency of the quarterly
poll. The estimates of the land-service were not discussed
without tedious debates, and warm disputes. The ministry
demanded fifty-four thousand men, twenty thousand of
whom should be kept at home for the defence of the na∣tion,
while the rest should serve abroad in the allied army.
Many members declared their aversion to a foreign war,
in which the nation had no immediate concern, and so
little prospect of success. Others agreed that the allies
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>
should be assisted on the continent with a proportion of
British forces; but that the nation should act as auxiliary,
not as a principal, and pay no more than what the people
would chearfully contribute to the general expense. These
reflexions, however, produced no other effect than that
of prolonging the debate. Ministerial influence had sur∣mounted
all opposition. The House voted the number of
men demanded. Such was their servile complaisance,
that when they examined the treaties by which the English
and Dutch contracted equally with the German princes,
and found that, notwithstanding these treaties, Britain
bore two thirds of the expense, they overlooked this flagrant
instance of partiality, and enabled the King to pay the
proportion. Nay, their maxims were so much altered,
that, instead of prosecuting their resentment against fo∣reign
generals, they assented to a motion that the Prince
of Wirtemberg, the Major-Generals, Tetteau and La
Forest, who commanded the Danish troops in the pay of
the States-General, should be indulged with such an addi∣tion
to their appointments as would make up the diffe∣rence
between the pay of England and that of Holland.
Finally, they voted above two millions for the subsistence
of the land-forces, and for defraying extraordinary ex∣penses
attending the war upon the continent, including
subsidies to the Electors of Saxony and Hanover.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The House of Lords, mean while, was not free
from animosity and contention. The Marlborough faction
exerted themselves with great vivacity. They affirmed, it
was the province of their House to advise the sovereign:
like the Commons, they insisted upon the King's having
asked their advice, because he had mentioned that word in
his speech, though he never dreamed they would catch at
it with such eagerness. They moved, that the task of
digesting the articles of advice should be undertaken by a
joint committee of both Houses; but all the dependents
of the court, including the whole bench of bishops, ex∣cept
Watson of St. David's, were marshalled to oppose
this motion, which was rejected by a majority of twelve;
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>
and this victory was followed with a protest of the van∣quished.
Notwithstanding this defeat, they prosecuted
their scheme of giving advice; and, after much wrangling
and declamation, the House agreed in an address or re∣monstrance,
advising and beseeching his Majesty, That
the commanding officer of the British forces should be an
Englishman: That English officers might take rank of
those in the confederate armies, who did not belong to
crowned heads: That the twenty thousand men to be left
for the defence of the kingdom should be all English, and
commanded by an English general: That the practice of
pressing men for the fleet should be remedied: that such
officers as were guilty of this practice should be cashiered
and punished; and, lastly, That no foreigners should sit
at the board of Ordnance. This address was presented to
the King, who received it coldly, and said he would take
it into consideration.</P>
<P>§ IX. Then the Lords resolved to enquire into the mis∣carriage
of the purposed descent, and called for all the
papers relating to that affair: but the aim of the majority
was not so much to rectify the errors of the government,
as to screen Nottingham, and censure Russel. That noble∣man
produced his own book of entries, together with the
whole correspondence between him and the Admiral, whom
he verbally charged with having contributed to the mis∣carriage
of the expedition. This affair was referred to a
committee. Sir John Ashby was examined. The House
directed the Earl to draw up the substance of his charge;
and these papers were afterwards delivered to a committee
of the Commons, at a conference, by the Lord President,
and the rest of the committee above. They were offered
for the inspection of the Commons, as they concerned
some members of that House, by whom they might be
informed more fully of the particulars they contained. At
another conference, which the Commons demanded,
their committee declared, in the name of the House, That
they had read and well considered the papers which their
lordships had sent them, and which they now returned:
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
That, finding Mr. Russel, one of their members, often
mentioned in the said papers, they had unanimously re∣solved,
That Admiral Russel, in his command of the
fleets, during the last summer's expedition, had behaved
with fidelity, courage, and conduct. The Lords, irritated
at this declaration, and disappointed in their resentment
against Russel, desired a free conference between the com∣mittees
of both Houses. The Earl of Rochester told the
Commons, he was commanded by the House of Lords to
inform them, that their lordships looked upon the late
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote and proceedings of the Lower House, in returning
their papers, to be irregular and unparliamentary, as they
had not communicated to their lordships the lights they
had received, and the reasons upon which their vote was
founded. A paper to the same purport was delivered to
Colonel Granville, who promised to present it to the
Commons, and make a faithful report of what his lord∣ship
had said. Thus the conference ended, and the en∣quiry
was discontinued.</P>
<P>§ X. The Lower House seemed to be as much exaspe∣rated
against the Earl of Nottingham as the Lords were
incensed at Russel. A motion was made, that his Majesty
should be advised to appoint such commissioners of the
board of Admiralty as were of known experience in mari∣time
affairs. Although this was over-ruled, they voted
an address to the King, praying, that, for the future, all
orders for the management of the fleet might pass through
the hands of the said commissioners; a protest by impli∣cation
against the conduct of the secretary. The conside∣ration
of ways and means was the next object that en∣grossed
the attention of the Lower House. They resolved
that a rate of four-shillings in the pound, for one year,
should be charged upon all lands, according to their
yearly value; as also upon all personal estates, and upon
all offices and employments of profit, other than military
offices in the army or navy. The act founded on this
resolution empowered the King to borrow money on the
credit of it, at seven per cent. They further enabled him
<PB N="172" REF="176"/>
to raise one million on the general credit of the Exchequer,
by granting annuities. They laid several new duties on a
variety of imports. They renewed the last quarterly poll,
providing, that in case it should not produce three hundred
thousand pounds, the deficiencies might be made up by
borrowing on the general credit of the Exchequer. They
continued the impositions on wine, vinegar, tobacco, and
sugar, for five years; and those on East-India goods for
four years. They laid a new imposition of eight per cent.
on the capital stock of the East-India company, estimated
at seven hundred and forty-four thousand pounds: of one
per cent. on the African; of five pounds on every share of
the stock belonging to the Hudson's-Bay company; and
they empowered his Majesty to borrow five hundred thou∣sand
pounds on these funds, which were expressly esta∣blished
for maintaining the war with vigour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French King, hearing how liberally William was supplied, ex∣claimed with some emotion, “My little cousin the Prince of Orange is fixed in the saddle—but, no matter, the last Louis d'or must carry it.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XI. The money-bills were retarded in the Upper-House,
by the arts of Hallifax, Mulgrave, and other
malcontents. They grafted a clause on the land-tax bill,
importing, that the Lords should tax themselves. It was
adopted by the majority, and the bill sent with this amend∣ment
to the Commons, by whom it was unanimously re∣jected,
as a flagrant attempt upon their privileges. They
demanded a conference, in which they declared that the
clause in question was a notorious encroachment upon the
right the Commons possessed, of regulating all matters
relating to supplies granted by parliament. When this
report was debated in the House of Lords, the Earl of
Mulgrave displayed uncommon powers of eloquence and
argument, in persuading the House, that, by yielding to
this claim of the Commons, they would divest them∣selves
of their true greatness, and nothing would remain
but the name and shadow of a peer, which was but a
pageant. Notwithstanding all his oratory, the Lords re∣linquished
their clause, declaring, at the same time, that
<PB N="173" REF="177"/>
they had agreed to pass the bill without alteration, merely
in regard to the present urgent state of affairs, as being
otherwise of opinion, that they had a right to insist upon
their clause. A formal complaint being made in the
House of Commons, against the pamphlet intitled, King
William and Queen Mary Conquerors, as containing as∣sertions
of dangerous consequence to their Majesties, to
the liberty of the subject, and the peace of the kingdom,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he licenser and printer were taken into custody. The
book being examined, they resolved that it should be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned by the hands of the common hangman; and, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he King should be moved to dismiss the licenser from his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mployment. The same sentence they pronounced upon a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astoral letter of Bishop Burnet, in which the notion of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onquest had been at first asserted. The Lords, in order
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o manifest their sentiments on the same subject, resolved,
That such an assertion was highly injurious to their Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esties,
inconsistent with the principles on which the go∣vernment
was founded, and tending to the subversion of
the rights of the people. Bohun, the licenser, was brought
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the bar of the House, and discharged upon his own
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etition, after having been reprimanded on his knees by
the Speaker.</P>
<P>§ XII. Several members having complained that their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervants had been kidnapped, and sent to serve as soldiers
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Flanders, the House appointed a committee to enquire
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the abuses committed by press-masters; and a suita∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
remonstrance was presented to the King, who expressed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is indignation at this practice, and assured the House that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he delinquents should be brought to exemplary punish∣ment.
Understanding, however, in the sequel, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethods taken by his Majesty for preventing this abuse
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad not proved effectual, they resumed their enquiry,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd proceeded with uncommon vigour on the informa∣tion
they received. A great number of persons who had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een pressed were discharged by order of the House; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apt. Winter, the chief undertaker for this method of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecruiting the army, was carried by the Serjeant before the
<PB N="174" REF="178"/>
Lord Chief Justice, that he might be prosecuted accord∣ing
to law.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Before the heats occasioned by this unpopular
expedient were allayed, the discontent of the nation was
further inflamed by complaints from Ireland, where Lord
Sidney was said to rule with despotick authority. These
complaints were exhibited by Sir Francis Brewster, Sir
William Gore, Sir John Macgill, Lieutenant Stafford,
Mr. Stone, and Mr. Kerne. They were examined at the
bar of the House, and delivered an account of their grie∣vances
in writing. Both Houses concurred in this enquiry,
which being finished, they severally presented addresses to
the King. The Lords observed, That there had been
great abuses in disposing of the forfeited estates: That
protections had been granted to the Irish not included in
the articles of Limerick: so that protestants were deprived
of the benefit of the law against them: That the quarters of
the army had not been paid according to the provision
made by parliament: That a mayor had been imposed
upon the city of Dublin for two years successively, con∣trary
to the ancient privileges and charter: That severa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
persons accused of murder had been executed without
proof; and one Sweetman, the most guilty, discharged
without prosecution. The Commons spoke more freely
in their address: they roundly explained the abuses and
mismanagement of that government, by exposing the pro∣testant
subjects to the free quarter and violence of a licen∣tious
army; by recruiting the troops with Irish papists
who had been in open rebellion against his Majesty; by
granting protections to Irish Roman catholics, whereby
the course of the law was stopped: by reversing outlaw
ries for high treason, not comprehended in the articles o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Limerick; by letting the forfeited estates at under value
to the prejudice of his Majesty's revenue; by embezzling
the stores left in the towns and garrisons by the late King
James, as well as the effects belonging to forfeited estates
which might have been employed for the better preserva∣tion
of the kingdom; and, finally, by making addition
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
to the articles of Limerick, after the capitulation was
signed, and the place surrendered. They most humbly
besought his Majesty to redress these abuses, which had
greatly encouraged the papists, and weakened the pro∣testant
interest in Ireland. The King graciously received
both addresses, and promised to pay a particular regard to
all remonstrances that should come from either House of
parliament: but no material step was taken against the
Lords Sidney, Athlone, and Coningsby, who appeared to
have engrossed great part of the forfeitures by grants from
the crown; and even Commissioner Culliford, who had
been guilty of the most grievous acts of oppression, es∣caped
with impunity.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The old Whig principle was not yet wholly
expelled from the Lower-House. The undue influence of
the court was exerted in such an open, scandalous man∣ner,
as gave offence to the majority of the Commons. In
the midst of their condescension, Sir Edward Hussey,
member for Lincoln, brought in a bill touching free and
impartial proceedings in parliament. It was intended to
disable all members of parliament from enjoying places of
trust and profit, and particularly levelled against the offi∣cers
of the army and navy, who had insinuated them∣selves
into the House in such numbers, that this was com∣monly
called the officers parliament. The bill passed the
House of Commons, and was sent up to the Lords, by
whom it was read a second time, and committed: but the
ministry employing their whole strength against it, on the
report it was thrown out by a majority of two voices. The
Earl of Mulgrave again distinguished himself by his elo∣cution,
in a speech that was held in great veneration by
the people; and, among those who entered a protest in
the journals of the House, when the majority rejected the
bill, was Prince George of Denmark, Duke of Cumberland.
The court had not recollected themselves from the con∣sternation
produced by such a vigorous opposition, when
the Earl of Shrewsbury produced another bill for triennial
parliaments, providing that there should be an annual session;
<PB N="176" REF="180"/>
that if, at the expiration of the three years, the crown
should not order the writs to be issued, the Lord Chan∣cellor,
or keeper, or commissioner of the great seal,
should issue them <HI>ex officio,</HI> and by authority of this act,
under severe penalties. The immediate object of this bill
was the dissolution of the present parliament, which had
already sat three sessions, and began to be formidable to
the people, from its concessions to the ministry. The
benefits that would accrue to the constitution from the
establishment of triennial parliaments were very well un∣derstood,
as these points had been frequently discussed in
former reigns. The courtiers now objected, that fre∣quent
elections would render the freeholders proud and
insolent, encourage faction among the electors, and entail
a continual expense upon the member, as he would find
himself obliged, during the whole time of his sitting, to
behave like a candidate, conscious how soon the time of
election would revolve. In spite of the ministerial interest
in the Upper-House, the bill passed, and contained a pro∣viso,
that the present parliament should not continue any
longer than the month of January next ensuing. The
court renewed its efforts against it in the House of Com∣mons,
where, nevertheless, it was carried, with some lit∣tle
alterations, which the Lords approved. But all these
endeavours were frustrated by the prerogative of the
King, who, by refusing his assent, prevented its being en∣acted
into a law.</P>
<P>§ XV. It was at the instigation of the ministry, that the
Commons brought in a bill for continuing and explaining
certain temporary laws then expiring or expired. Among
these was an act for restraining the liberty of the press▪
which owed its origin to the reign of Charles II. and had
been revived in the first year of the succeeding reign▪
The bill passed the Lower-House without difficulty, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
met with warm opposition in the House of Lords, a good
number of whom protested against it, as a law that sub∣jected
all learning and true information to the arbitrary
will of a mercenary, and perhaps ignorant licenser, de∣stroyed
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>
the properties of authors, and extended the evil
of monopolies. The bill for regulating trials was dropped,
and, in lieu of it, another produced for the preservation
of their Majesties sacred persons and government: but this
too was rejected by the majority, in consequence of the
ministry's secret management.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1693.</NOTE> The East-India com∣pany
narrowly escaped dissolution. Petitions and counter-petitions
were delivered into the House of Commons: the
pretensions on both sides were carefully examined: a
committee of the whole House resolved, that there should
be a new subscription of a joint-stock, not exceeding two
millions five hundred thousand pounds, to continue for
one-and-twenty years. The report was made and received,
and the publick expected to see the affair brought to a
speedy issue: but the company had recourse to the same
expedients, which had lately proved so successful in the
hands of the ministry. Those who had been the most
warm in detecting their abuses suddenly cooled; and the
prosecution of the affair began to languish. Not but that
the House presented an address to his Majesty, praying
that he would dissolve the company upon three years
warning, according to the condition of their charter. He
told them he would consider their address; and they did
not further urge their remonstrance. The bill for ascer∣taining
the commissions and salaries of the judges, to which
the King had refused the royal assent in the last session,
was revived, twice read, and rejected; and another, for
preventing the exportation and melting of the coin, they
suffered to lie neglected on the table. On the fourteenth
day of March, the King put an end to the session, after
having thanked the parliament for so great testimonies
of their affection, and promised the supplies should not
be misapplied. He observed, that the posture of affairs
called him abroad; but that he would leave a sufficient
number of troops for the security o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the kingdom: he
assured them he would expose his person upon all occa∣sions
for the advantage of these kingdoms; and use his
<PB N="178" REF="182"/>
utmost endeavours to make them a flourishing nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The other laws made in this s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion were these that follow:—An act for preventing suit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against such as had acted for their Majesti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s service in defence of this kingdom—An act for raising the militia in the year 1693—An act, authorising the judges to empower such persons, other than common attornies and solicitors, as they should think sit, to take special bail, except in London, Westminster, and ten miles round—An act to encourage the ap∣prehending of highwaymen—An act to prevent clandestine marriages—An act for the regaining, encouraging, and settling the Greenland trade—An act to prevent malicious informations in the court of King's-Bench, and for the more easy reversal of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lawries in that court—An act for the better discover∣ry of judgments in the courts of law—An act for delivering declarations to prisoner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for debt—An act for regulating proceedings in the Crown-office—An act for the more easy discovery and conviction of such as should destroy the game of this kingdom—An act for continuing the acts for prohibiting all trade and commerce with France, and for the encouragement of priva∣teers.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1693.</NOTE></P>
<P>§ XVI. During the course of this session, Lord Mohun
was indicted and tried by his peers, in Westminster-hall,
as an accomplice in the murder of one Montford, a cele∣brated
comedian, the Marquis of Caermarthen acting as
lord-steward upon this occasion. The judges having been
consulted, the peers proceeded to give their judgements
<HI>seriatim,</HI> and Mohun was acquitted by a great majority.
The King, who, from his first accession to the throne,
had endeavoured to trim the balance between the Whigs
and Tories, by mingling them together in his ministry,
made some alterations at this period, that savoured of
the same policy. The great-seal, with the title of Lord
Keeper, was bestowed upon Sir John Somers, who was
well skilled in the law, as in many other branches of po∣lite
and useful literature. He possessed a remarkable ta∣lent
for business, in which he exerted great patience and
assiduity; was gentle, candid, and equitable; a Whig in
principles, yet moderate, pacifick, and conciliating. Of
the same temper was Sir John Trenchard, now appointed
secretary of state. He had been concerned with the Duke
of Monmouth, and escaped to the continent, where he
lived some years; was calm, sedate, well acquainted with
foreign affairs, and considered as a leading man in his
<PB N="179" REF="183"/>
party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1693.</NOTE> These two are said to have been promoted at the
recommendation of the Earl of Sunderland, who had
by this time insinuated himself into the King's favour and
confidence; though his success confirmed the opinion
which many entertained, of his having betrayed his old
master. The leaders of the opposition were Sir Edward
Seymour, again become a malcontent, and Sir Christopher
Musgrave, a gentleman of Cumberland, who, though an
extravagant Tory from principle, had refused to concur
with all the designs of the late King. He was a person of
a grave and regular deportment, who had rejected many
offers of the ministry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Hist. of K. W. Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Slone's Nar. Feuquieres. Voltaire. Ralph. Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndal. State tracts.</NOTE> which he opposed with great vio∣lence:
yet on some critical occasions, his patriotism gave
way to his avarice, and he yielded upon some important
points, in consideration of large sums which he received
from the court in secret. Others declared war against
the administration, because they thought their own talents
were not sufficiently considered. Of these, the chiefs
were Paul Foley and Robert Harley. The first was a
lawyer of good capacity, extensive learning, and virtuous
principles; but peevish, obstinate, and morose. He enter∣tained
a very despicable opinion of the court; and this he
propagated with equal assiduity and success. Harley pos∣sessed
a good fund of learning; was capable of uncommon
application, particularly turned to politicks. He knew the
forms of parliament, had a peculiar dexterity at protract∣ing
and perplexing debates; and cherished the most a∣spiring
ambition. Admiral Russel was created treasurer of
the household; but the command of the fleet was vested
in the hands of Killigrew, Delaval, and Shovel. Sir Geo.
Rooke was declared vice-admiral of the red, and John
Lord Berkeley, of the blue division; their rear-admirals
were Matthew Aylmer and David Mitchel.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The King having visited the fleet and fortifi∣cations
at Portsmouth, given instructions for annoying the
enemy by sea, and left the administration in the hands
of the Queen, embarked on the last day of March, near
Gravesend, and arrived in Holland on the third of April.
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>
The troops of the confederates were forthwith ordered to
assemble: but while he was employed in making prepara∣tions
for the campaign, the French King actually took
the field, attended by Madame de Maintenon, and all the
court ladies. His design was supposed to be upon some
town in Brabant: his army amounted to one hundred
and twenty thousand men, completely armed, and abun∣dantly
supplied with all necessaries for every sort of mili∣tary
operation. King William immediately took possession
of the strong camp at Parke near Louvain, a situation
which enabled him to cover the places that were most ex∣posed.
Understanding that the French emissaries had sown
the seeds of dissention between the Bishop and chapter of
Liege, he sent the Duke of Wirtemberg thither, to re∣concile
the different parties, and concert measures for the
further security of the place. He re-enforced the garri∣son
with nine battalions; and the Elector Palatine lay
with his troops in readiness to march to its relief. Wil∣liam
likewise threw re-enforcements into Maestricht,
Huy, and Charleroy; and he himself resolved to remain
on the defensive, at the head of sixty thousand men, with
a numerous train of artillery.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Louis having reviewed his army at Gem∣blours,
and seen his designs upon Brabant defeated by the
diligence of his antagonist, detached Boufflers with twenty
thousand men to the Upper Rhine, to join the Dauphin,
who commanded in that quarter; then leaving the con∣duct
of his forces in the Netherlands to the Duke de
Luxembourg, he returned with his court to Versailles.
Immediately after his departure, Luxembourg fixed his
head quarters at Mildert; and King William strengthened
his camp on that side with ten battalions, and eight-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. The enemy's convoys were
frequently surprised by detachments from the garrison of
Charleroy; and a large body of horse, foot, and dragoons,
being drafted out of Liege and Maestricht, took post at
Huy, under the command of the Count de Tilly, so as to
straiten the French in their quarters. These, however,
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>
were dislodged by Luxembourg in person, who obliged
the Count to pass the Jaar with precipitation, leaving be∣hind
three squadrons and all his baggage, which fell into
the hands of the enemy. This check, however, was ba∣lanced
by the success of the Duke of Wirtemberg, who,
at the head of thirteen battalions of infantry, and twenty
squadrons of horse, forced the French lines between the
Schelde and the Lys: and laid the whole country as far
as Lisle under contribution. On that very day, which was
the eighteenth of July, Luxembourg marched towards
Huy, which was next morning invested by M. de Villeroy.
The other covered the siege, and secured himself from the
allies by lines of contravallation. Before their batteries
began to play, the town capitulated. On the twenty-third
day of the month, the garrison mutinied; the castles
were surrendered; the governor remained a prisoner; and
his men were conducted to Liege. The confederate army
advanced in order to relieve the town: but the King be∣ing
apprised of its fate, detached ten battalions to re-enforce
the garrison of Liege, and next day returned to
Neer-Hespen.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Luxembourg made a motion towards Liege, as
if he had intended to besiege the place; and encamped at
Hellecheim, about seven leagues from the confederates.
Knowing how much they were weakened by the different
detachments which had been made from their army, he
resolved to attack them in their camp, or at least fall up∣on
their rear, should they retreat at his approach. On the
twenty-eighth day of July, he began his march in four
columns, and passed the Jaar near its source, with an ar∣my
superior to the allies by five-and-thirty thousand men.
The King of England at first looked upon this motion as
a feint to cover the design upon Liege: but receiving in∣telligence
that their whole army was in full march to at∣tack
him in his camp, he resolved to keep his ground; and
immediately drew up his forces in order of battle. His
general-officers advised him to repass the Geete: but he
chose to risque a battle, rather than expose the rear of his
<PB N="182" REF="186"/>
army in repassing that river. His right wing extended as
far as Neer-Winden, along the Geete, covered with
hedges, hollow-ways, and a small rivulet: the left reached
to Neer-Landen; and these two villages were joined by
a slight entrenchment, which the King ordered to be
thrown up in the evening. Brigadier Ramsey, with the
regiments of Ofarrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven, and Mon∣roe,
were ordered to the right of the whole army, to line
some hedges and hollow-ways, on the farther side of the
village of Lare. Six battalions of Brandenburgh were
posted to the left of this village; and General Dumont,
with the Hanoverian infantry, possessed the village of Neer-Winden,
which covered part of the camp, between the
main body and the right wing of the cavalry. Neer-Lan∣den
on the left, was secured by six battalions of English,
Danes, and Dutch. The remaining infantry was drawn up
in one line behind the entrenchment. The dragoons up∣on
the left guarded the village of Dormal upon the brook
of Beck; and from thence the left wing of horse extend∣ed
to Neer-Landen, where it was covered by this rivulet.</P>
<P>§ XX. The King having visited all the posts on horse∣back,
and given the necessary orders, reposed himself
about two hours in his coach; and early in the morning
sent for his chaplain, whom he joined in prayer with great
devotion. At sun-rising the enemy appeared drawn up in
order of battle: and the allies began to play their cannon
with good success. About eight in the morning they at∣tacked
the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden with great
fury; and twice made themselves masters of these posts,
from whence they were as often repulsed. The allies still
kept their ground; and, the Duke of Berwick was taken
by his uncle Brigadier Churchill. Then the French made
an attack upon the left wing of the confederates at Neer-Landen;
and, after a very obstinate dispute, were obliged
to give way, though they still kept possession of the ave∣nues.
The Prince of Conti, however, renewed the charge
with the slower of the French infantry; and the confe∣derates
being overpowered, retreated from the village,
<PB N="183" REF="187"/>
leaving the camp in that part exposed. Villeroy marching
this way with a body of horse, was encountered and re∣pulsed
by the Count D'Arco, general of the Bavarian
cuirassiers; and the Duke de Chartres narrowly escaped
being taken. Meanwhile, Luxembourg, the Prince of
Conti, the Count de Marsin, and the Mareschal de Joy∣euse,
charged on the right, and in different parts of the
line, with such impetuosity as surmounted all resistance.
The camp of the confederates was immediately filled with
French troops: the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden
were taken, after a long and desperate dispute. The Ha∣noverian
and Dutch horse being broken, the King in per∣son
brought the English cavalry to their assistance. They
fought with great gallantry; and for some time retarded
the fate of the day. The infantry was rallied, and stood
firm until all their ammunition was expended. In a word,
they were scarce able to sustain the weight of such a supe∣riority
in point of number, when the Marquis D'Har∣court
joined the enemy from Huy, with two-and-twenty
fresh squadrons, which immediately turned the scale in
their favour. The Elector of Bavaria, after having made
extraordinary efforts, retreated with great difficulty over
the bridge to the other side of the river, where he rallied
the troops, in order to favour the retreat of those who had
not passed. The King seeing the battle lost, and the
whole army in confusion, retired with the infantry to
Dormal on the brook of Beck, where the dragoons of
the left wing were posted, and then ordered the regiments
of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, to cover his retreat
over the bridge at Neer-Hespen, which he effected with
great difficulty. Now all was tumult, route, and conster∣nation;
and a great number of the fugitives threw them∣selves
into the river, where they were drowned. This had
like to have been the fate of the brave Earl of Athlone:
the Duke of Ormond was wounded in several places, and
taken prisoner by the enemy; and the Count de Solmes
was mortally wounded. Ptolemache brought off the
greater part of the English infantry with great gallantry
<PB N="184" REF="188"/>
and conduct: as for the baggage, it had been sent to
Liege before the engagement: but, the confederates lost
sixty pieces of cannon, and nine mortars, a great number
of standards and colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Luxembourg sent such a number of standards and ensigns to Paris, during the course of this war, that the Prince of Conti called him the Upholsterer of Notre-Dame, a church in which those trophies were dis∣played.</NOTE>, with about seven thousand men
killed and wounded in the action. It must be owned that
the allies fought with great valour and perseverance; and
that King William made prodigious efforts of courage
and activity to retrieve the fortune of the day. He was
present in all parts of the battle: he charged in person
both on horseback and on foot, where the danger was most
imminent. His peruke, the sleeve of his coat, and the
knot of his scarf were penetrated by three different mus∣ket-bullets;
and he saw a great number of soldiers fall on
every side of him. The enemy bore witness to his ex∣traordinary
valour. The Prince of Conti, in a letter to
his Princess, which was intercepted, declared, that he
saw the Prince of Orange exposing himself to the greatest
dangers: and that such valour richly deserved the peace∣able
possession of the crown he wore. Yet here, as in
every other battle he fought, his conduct and disposition
were severely censured. Luxembourg having observed the
nature of his situation immediately before the engagement,
is said to have exclaimed, “Now, I believe Waldeck is
really dead;” alluding to that general's known sagacity
in choosing ground for an encampment. Be that as it
will, he paid dear for his victory. His loss in officers
and men exceeded that of the allies; and he reaped no
solid advantage from the battle. He remained fifteen
days inactive at Waren, while King William, recalling
the Duke of Wirtemberg, and drafting troops from
Liege and other garrisons, was in a few days able to ha∣zard
another engagement.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Nothing remarkable happened during the re∣maining
part of the campaign, until Luxembourg, being
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>
rejoined by Boufflers with a strong re-enforcement from
the Rhine, invested Charleroy. He had taken his mea∣sures
with such caution and dexterity, that the allies
could not frustrate his operations, without attacking his
lines at a great disadvantage. The King detached the
Elector of Bavaria and the Duke of Wirtemberg, with
thirty battalions and forty squadrons, to make a diversion
in Flanders: but, they returned in a few days, without
having attempted any thing of consequence. The garrison
of Charleroy defended the place with surprising valour,
from the tenth of September to the eleventh of October,
during which period they had repulsed the assailants in
several attacks: but, at length, despairing of relief, the
governor capitulated on the most honourable conditions:
the reduction of the place was celebrated with a <HI>Te Deum,</HI>
and other rejoicings at Paris. Louis, however, in the
midst of all his glory, was extremely mortified when he
reflected upon the little advantage he had reaped from all
his late victories. The allies had been defeated succes∣sively
at Flerus, Steenkerke and Landen: yet in a fort∣night
after each of those battles, William was always in
a condition to risque another engagement. Formerly
Louis had conquered half of Holland, Flanders, and
Franche-Comté, without a battle; whereas, now he
could not with his utmost efforts, and after the most
signal victories, pass the frontiers of the United Provinces.
The conquest of Charleroy concluded the campaign in
the Netherlands, and both armies went into winter-quarters.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The French army on the Rhine, under De
Lorges, passed that river in the month of May at Philips∣burgh,
and invested the city of Heidelberg, which they
took, plundered, and reduced to ashes. This general
committed numberless barbarities in the Palatinate, which
he ravaged without even sparing the tombs of the dead.
The French soldiers, on this occasion, seem to have been
actuated by the most brutal inhumanity. They butchered
the inhabitants, violated the women, plundered the
<PB N="186" REF="190"/>
houses, rifled the churches, and murthered priests at the
altar. They broke open the electoral vault, and scattered
the ashes of that illustrious family about the streets. They
set fire to different quarters of the city: they stripped
about fifteen thousand of the inhabitants, without di∣stinction
of age or sex, and drove them naked into the
castle, that the garrison might be the sooner induced to
capitulate. There they remained like cattle in the open
air, without food or covering, tortured between the
horrours of their fate and the terrours of a bombardment.
When they were set at liberty, in consequence of the
fort's being surrendered, a great number of them died
along the banks of the Neckar, from cold, hunger, an∣guish,
and despair. These enormous cruelties, which
would have disgraced the arms of a Tartarian freebooter,
were acted by the express command of Louis XIV. of
France, who has been celebrated by so many venal pens,
not only as the greatest monarch, but also as the most
polished prince of Christendom. De Lorges advanced
towards the Neckar against the Prince of Baden, who lay
encamped on the other side of that river: but in attempt∣ing
to pass, he was twice repulsed with considerable da∣mage.
The Dauphin joining the army, which now
amounted to seventy thousand men, crossed without oppo∣sition;
but, found the Germans so advantageously posted,
that he would not hazard an attack: having, therefore,
repassed the river, he secured Stutgard with a garrison,
sent detachments into Flanders and Piedmont, and re∣turned
in August to Versailles. In Piedmont the allies
were still more unfortunate. The Duke of Savoy and his
confederates seemed bent upon driving the French from
Casal and Pignerol. The first of these places was blocked
up, and the other actually invested. The fort of St.
Bridget, that covered the place, was taken, and the town
bombarded. Mean while Catinat being re-enforced▪
descended into the plains. The Duke was so apprehen∣sive
of Turin, that he abandoned the siege of Pignerol
after having blown up the fort, and marched in quest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="187" REF="191"/>
the enemy to the plain of Marsaglia, in the neighbourhood
of his capital. On the fourth day of October, the French
advanced upon them from the hills, between Orbasson
and Prosasque; and a desperate engagement ensued. The
enemy charged the left wing of the confederates sword in
hand with incredible fury: though they were once re∣pulsed,
they renewed the attack with such impetuosity,
that the Neapolitan and Milanese horse were obliged to
give way, and disordered the German cavalry. These
falling upon the foot, threw the whole wing into con∣fusion.
Meanwhile, the main body and the other wing
sustained the charge without flinching, until they were
exposed in flank by the defeat of the cavalry: then the
whole front gave way. In vain the second line was brought
up to sustain them: the horse turned their backs, and the
infantry was totally routed. In a word, the confederates
were obliged to retire with precipitation, leaving their
cannon, and about eight thousand men killed or wounded
on the field of battle. The Duke of Schomberg having
been denied the post which was his due, insisted upon
fighting at the head of the troops maintained by the
King of Great-Britain, who were posted in the centre,
and behaved with great gallantry under the eye of their
commander. When the left wing was defeated, the
Count de los Torres desired he would take upon him the
command, and retreat with the infantry and right wing:
but, he refused to act without the order of his highness,
and said, things were come to such a pass, that they must
either conquer or die▪ He continued to animate his men
with his voice and example, until he received a shot in
the thigh. His valet seeing him fall, ran to his assistance,
and called for quarter, but was killed by the enemy be∣fore
he could be understood. The Duke being taken at
the same instant, was afterwards dismissed upon his
parole, and in a few days died at Turin, universally la∣mented
on account of his great and amiable qualities.
The Earl of Warwick and Holland, who accompanied
him as a volunteer, shared his fate in being wounded and
<PB N="188" REF="192"/>
taken prisoner: but he soon recovered his health and
liberty. This victory was as unsubstantial as that of
Landen, and almost as dear in the purchase; for, the
confederates made an obstinate defence, and yielded solely
to superior number. The Duke of Savoy retreated to
Moncalier, and threw a re-enforcement into Conti, which
Catinat would not venture to besiege, so severely had he
been handled in the battle. He, therefore, contented
himself with laying the country under contribution, re-enforcing
the garrisons of Casal, Pignerol, and Susa, and
making preparations for repassing the mountains. The
news of the victory no sooner reached Paris, than Louis
dispatched M. de Chanlais to Turin, with proposals for
detaching the Duke of Savoy from the interest of the
allies; and the Pope, who was now become a partisan of
France, supported the negociation with his whole in∣fluence:
but the French King had not yet touched upon
the right string. The Duke continued deaf to all his ad∣dresses.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. France had been alike successful in her in∣trigues
at the courts of Rome and Constantinople. The
Visir at the Porte had been converted into a pensionary
and creature of Louis; but, the war in which the Turks
had been so long and unsuccessfully engaged rendered
him so odious to the people, that the Grand Signor deposed
him, in order to appease their clamours. The English
and Dutch ambassadors at Constantinople forthwith re∣newed
their mediation for a peace with the Emperor; but
the terms they proposed were still rejected with disdain.
In the mean time General Heusler, who commanded the
Imperialists in Transylvania, reduced the fortresses of Jeno
and Villaguswar. In the beginning of July the Duke de
Croy assumed the chief command of the German army,
passed the Danube and the Saave, and invested Belgrade.
The siege was carried on for some time with great vigour:
but, at length, abandoned at the approach of the Visir,
who obliged the Imperialists to repass the Saave, and sent
out parties which made incursions into Upper-Hungary.
<PB N="189" REF="193"/>
The power of France had never been so conspicuous as at
this juncture, when she maintained a formidable navy at
sea, and four great armies in different parts of Europe.
Exclusive of the operations in Flanders, Germany, and
Piedmont, the Count de Noailles invested Roses in Cata∣lonia,
about the latter end of May, while at the same
time it was blocked up by the French fleet, under the
command of the Count D'Etrees. In a few days the place
was surrendered by capitulation, and the castle of Ampu∣rias
met with the same fate. The Spanish power was
reduced to such a degree, that Noailles might have pro∣ceeded
in his conquests without interruption, had not he
been obliged to detach part of his army to re-enforce
Catinat in Piedmont.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. Nothing could be more inglorious for the
English than their operations by sea in the course of this
summer. The King had ordered the admirals to use all
possible dispatch in equipping the fleets, that they might
block up the enemy in their own ports, and protect the
commerce, which had suffered severely from the French
privateers. They were, however, so dilatory in their
proceedings, that the squadrons of the enemy sailed from
their harbours before the English fleet could put to sea.
About the middle of May it was assembled at St. Helen's,
and took on board sive regiments, intended for a descent
on Brest; but this enterprise was never attempted. When
the English and Dutch squadrons joined, so as to form a
very numerous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet, the publick expected they would
undertake some expedition of importance: but the ad∣mirals
were divided in opinion, nor did their orders
warrant their executing any scheme of consequence.
Killigrew and Delaval did not escape the suspicion of being
disaffected to the service; and France was said to have
maintained a secret correspondence with the malcontents
in England. Louis had made surprising efforts to repair
the damage which his navy had sustained. He had pur∣chased
several large vessels, and converted them into ships
of war: he had laid an embargo on all the shipping of his
<PB N="190" REF="194"/>
kingdom, until his squadrons were manned: he had made
a grand naval promotion, to encourage the officers and
seamen; and this expedient produced a wonderful spirit
of activity and emulation. In the month of May his fleet
sailed to the Mediterranean, in three squadrons, consisting
of seventy-one capital ships, besides bomb-ketches, fire∣ships,
and tenders.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In the beginning of June, the English and
Dutch fleets sailed down the channel. On the sixth, Sir
George Rooke was detached to the Straits with a squadron
of three-and-twenty ships, as convoy to the Mediterranean
trade. The great fleet returned to Torbay, while he
pursued his voyage, having under his protection about
four hundred merchant ships belonging to England, Hol∣land,
Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, and Flanders.
On the sixteenth, his scouts discovered part of the French
fleet under Cape St. Vincent: next day their whole navy
appeared, to the amount of eighty sail. Sixteen of these
plied up to the English squadron, while the vice-admiral
of the white stood off to sea, to intercept the ships under
convoy. Sir George Rooke, by the advice of the Dutch
vice-admiral Vandergoes, resolved, if possible, to avoi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an engagement, which could only tend to their absolut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ruin. He forthwith sent orders to the small ships tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were near the land, to put into the neighbouring ports o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Faro, St. Lucar, and Cadix, while he himself stood of
with an easy sail for the protection of the rest. About <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in the evening, ten sail of the enemy came up with tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Dutch ships of war, commanded by the Captains Schrijve
and Vander-Poel, who seeing no possibility of escaping
tacked in shore; and, thus drawing the French afte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them, helped to save the rest of the sleet. When attacke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they made a most desperate defence, but at last were over
powered by numbers, and taken. An English ship <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
war and a rich pinnace were burned; nine and twent
merchant-vessels were taken, and about fifty destroyed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Counts de Tourville and D'Etrees. Seven of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
largest Smyrna ships fell into the hands of M. de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="191" REF="195"/>
and four he sunk in the bay of Gibraltar. The
value of the loss sustained on this occasion amounted to
one million sterling. Mean while Rooke stood off with a
fresh gale, and on the nineteenth sent home the Lark ship
of war with the news of his misfortune; then he bore
away for the Madeiras, where having taken in wood and
water, he set sail for Ireland, and on the third day of
August arrived at Cork, with fifty sail, including ships of
war and trading vessels. He detached Captain Fairborne
to Kinsale, with all his squadron, except six ships of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line, with which, in pursuance of orders, he joined the
great fleet then cruising in the chops of the channel. On
the twenty-fifth day of August, they returned to St.
Helen's, and the four regiments were landed. On the
nineteenth day of September, fifteen Dutch ships of the
line, and two frigates, set sail for Holland; and twenty-six
sail, with seven fireships, were assigned as guard-ships
during the winter.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The French admirals, instead of pursuing
Rooke to Madeira, made an unsuccessful attempt upon
Cadix, and bombarded Gibraltar, where the merchants
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unk their ships, that they might not fall into the hands of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he enemy. Then they sailed along the coast of Spain,
destroyed some English and Dutch vessels at Malaga, Ali∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant,
and other places; and returned in triumph to Tou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.
About this period, Sir Francis Wheeler returned to
England with his squadron, from an unfortunate expe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition
in the West-Indies. In conjunction with Colonel
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odrington, governor of the Leeward islands, he made
unsuccessful attempts upon the islands of Martinique and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ominique. Then he sailed to Boston in New-England,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith a view to concert an expedition against Quebec,
which was judged impracticable. He afterwards steered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Placentia in Newfoundland, which he would have at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cked
without hesitation; but the design was rejected by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> majority of voices in the council of war. Thus disap∣pointed,
he set sail for England; and arrived at Ports∣mouth
<PB N="192" REF="196"/>
in a very shattered condition, the greater part of
his men having died in the course of this voyage.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In November another effort was made to
annoy the enemy. Commodore Benbow sailed with a
squadron of twelve capital ships, four bomb-ketches, and
ten brigantines, to the coast of St. Maloes, and anchoring
within half a mile of the town, cannonaded and bombarded
it for three days successively. Then his men landed on
an island, where they burned a convent. On the nine∣teenth,
they took the advantage of a dark night, a fresh
gale, and a strong tide, to send in a fireship of a particular
contrivance, stiled the Infernal, in order to burn the town:
but, she struck upon a rock before she arrived at the place,
and the engineer was obliged to set her on fire, and retreat.
She continued burning for some time, and at last blew
up, with such an explosion as shook the whole town like
an earthquake, unroofed three hundred houses, and broke
all the glass and earthen ware for three leagues around.
A capstan that weighed two hundred pounds was trans∣ported
into the place, and falling upon a house, levelled it
to the ground: the greatest part of the wall towards the
sea tumbled down; and the inhabitants were overwhelmed
with consternation: so that a small number of troops
might have taken possession without resistance; but there
was not a soldier on board. Nevertheless, the sailors took
and demolished Quince-fort, and did considerable damage
to the town of St. Maloes, which had been a nest of pri∣vateers
that insested the English commerce. Though this
attempt was executed with great spirit, and some success,
the clamours of the people became louder and louder.
They scrupled not to say, that the councils of the nation
were betrayed; and their suspicions rose even to the secre∣tary's
office. They observed, that the French were pre∣viously
acquainted with all the motions of the English, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
took their measures accordingly for their destruction
They collected and compared a good number of particu∣lars,
that seemed to justify their suspicion of treachery
But the misfortunes of the nation, in all probability, aros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="193" REF="197"/>
from a motley ministry, divided among themselves, who,
instead of acting in concert for the publick good, em∣ployed
all their influence to thwart the views, and blacken
the reputations of each other. The people in general ex∣claimed
against the Marquis of Caermarthen, the Earls
of Nottingham and Rochester, who had acquired great
credit with the Queen, and, from their hatred to the
Whigs, betrayed the interests of the nation.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. But if the English were discontented, the
French were miserable, in spite of all their victories. That
kingdom laboured under a dreadful famine, occasioned
partly from unfavourable seasons, and partly from the war,
which had not left hands sufficient to cultivate the ground.
Notwithstanding all the diligence and providence of their
ministry, in bringing supplies of corn from Sweden and
Denmark, their care in regulating the price, and furnish∣ing
the markets, their liberal contributions for the relief
of the indigent; multitudes perished of want, and the
whole kingdom was reduced to poverty and distress.
Louis pined in the midst of his success. He saw his sub∣jects
exhausted by a ruinous war, in which they had been
involved by his ambition. He tampered with the allies
apart, in hopes of dividing and detaching them from the
grand confederacy: he sollicited the northern crowns to
engage as mediators for a general peace. A memorial
was actually presented by the Danish minister to King
William, by which it appears, that the French King
would have been contented to purchase a peace with some
considerable concessions: but the terms were rejected by
the King of England, whose ambition and revenge were
not yet gratified; and whose subjects, though heavy
laden, could still bear additional burthens.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The Jacobites had been very attentive to the
progress of dissatisfaction in England, which they fomented
with their usual assiduity. The late declaration of King
James had been couched in such imperious terms as gave
offence even to some of those who favoured his interest.
The Earl of Middleton, therefore, in the beginning of the
<PB N="194" REF="198"/>
year repaired to St. Germain's, and obtained another,
which contained the promise of a general pardon without
exceptions, and every other concession that a British sub∣ject
could demand of his sovereign. About the latter end
of May, two men, named Canning and Dormer, were ap∣prehended
for dispersing copies of this paper, tried at the
Old-Bailey, found guilty of not only dispersing, but also
of composing a false and seditious libel, sentenced to pay
five hundred marks a-piece, to stand three times in the
pillory, and find sureties for their good behaviour. But
no circumstance reflected more disgrace on this reign, than
the fate of Anderton, the supposed printer of some tracts
against the government. He was brought to tryal for high-treason:
he made a vigorous defence, in spite of the insults
and discouragements he sustained from a partial bench. As
nothing but presumptions appeared against him, the jury
scrupled to bring in a verdict that would affect his life,
until they were reviled and reprimanded by Judge Treby;
then they found him guilty. In vain recourse was had to
the Queen's mercy: he suffered death at Tyburn; and
left a paper, protesting solemnly against the proceedings of
the court, which he affirmed was appointed, not to try,
but to convict him; and petitioning heaven to forgive his
penitent jury. The severity of the government was like∣wise
exemplified in the case of some adventurers, who
having equipped privateers to cruise upon the English,
under joint commissions from the late King James and
Louis XIV. happened to be taken by the English ships of
war. Dr. Oldys, the King's advocate, being commanded
to proceed against them as guilty of treason and piracy,
refused to commence the prosecution; and gave his opi∣nion
in writing, that they were neither traitors nor pirates.
He supported this opinion by arguments before the council:
these were answered by Dr. Littleton, who succeeded him
in the office from which he was dismissed; and the pri∣soners
were executed as traitors. The Jacobites did not
fail to retort those arts upon the government, which their
adversaries had so successfully practised in the late reign.
<PB N="195" REF="199"/>
They inveighed against the vindictive spirit of the admi∣nistration,
and taxed it with encouraging informers and
false witnesses; a charge for which there was too much
foundation.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The friends of James in Scotland still conti∣nued
to concert designs in his favour: but their corre∣spondence
was detected, and their aims defeated, by the
vigilance of the ministry in that kingdom. Secretary
Johnston not only kept a watchful eye over all their
transactions, but, by a dexterous management of court
liberality and favour, appeased the discontents of the pres∣byterians
so effectually, that the King ran no risque in
assembling the parliament. Some offices were bestowed
upon the leaders of the kirk-party; and the Duke of Ha∣milton
being reconciled to the government, was appointed
commissioner. On the eighteenth day of April, the session
was opened, and the King's letter, replete with the most
cajoling expressions, being read, the parliament proceeded
to exhibit undeniable specimens of their good-humour.
They drew up a very affectionate answer to his Majesty's
letter: They voted an addition of six new regiments to
the standing forces of the kingdom: They granted a sup∣ply
of above one hundred and fifty thousand pounds ster∣ling
to his Majesty: They enacted a law for levying men
to serve on board the royal navy: They fined all ab∣sentees,
whether Lords or Commons; and vacated the
seats of all those commissioners who refused to take the
oath of assurance, which was equivalent to an abjuration
of King James: They set on foot an enquiry about an in∣tended
invasion: They published some intercepted letters,
supposed to be written to King James by Nevil Payne,
whom they committed to prison, and threatened with a
tryal for high treason; but he eluded the danger, by
threatening in his turn to impeach those who had made
their peace with the government: They passed an act for
the comprehension of such of the episcopal clergy as should
condescend to take the oaths by the tenth day of July.
All that the general assembly required of them, was, an
<PB N="196" REF="200"/>
offer to subscribe the confession of faith, and to acknow∣ledge
presbytery as the only government of the Scottish
church: but they neither submitted to these terms, nor
took the oaths within the limited time; so that they for∣feited
all legal right to their benefices. Nevertheless, they
continued in possession, and even received private assur∣ances
of the King's protection. It was one of William's
political maxims, to court his domestick enemies; but it
was never attended with any good effect. This indul∣gence
gave offence to the presbyterians, and former di∣stractions
began to revive.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The King having prevailed upon the States-General
to augment their land-forces and navy for the ser∣vice
of the ensuing campaign, embarked for England, and
arrived at Kensington on the thirtieth day of October.
Finding the people clamorous and discontented, the trade
of the nation decayed, the affairs of state mismanaged, and
the ministers recriminating upon one another, he per∣ceived
the necessity of changing hands, and resolved to
take his measures accordingly. Sunderland, his chief
counsellor, represented, that the Tories were averse to the
continuance of a war, which had been productive of no∣thing
but damage and disgrace; whereas, the Whigs were
much more practicable, and would bleed freely, partly
from the terrours of invasion and popery, partly from the
ambition of being courted by the crown, and partly from
the prospect of advantage, in advancing money to the
government on the funds established by parliament: for
that sort of traffick which obtained the appellation of the
monied-interest was altogether a whiggish institution.
The King revolved these observations in his own mind;
and, in the mean time, the parliament met on the seventh
day of November, pursuant to the last prorogation. In
his speech, he expressed his resentment against those who
were the authors of the miscarriages at sea; represente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the necessity of increasing the land-forces and the navy
and demanded a suitable supply for these purposes. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
order to pave the way to their condescension, he had already
<PB N="197" REF="201"/>
dismissed from his council the Earl of Nottingham, who,
of all his ministers, was the most odious to the people.
His place would have been immediately filled with the
Earl of Shrewsbury: but that nobleman, suspecting this
was a change of men rather than of measures, stood aloof
for some time, until he received such assurances from the
King as quieted his scruples, and then he accepted the
office of secretary. The lieutenancy for the city of Lon∣don,
and all other commissions over England, were altered
with a view to favour the Whig interest; and the indi∣viduals
of that party were indulged with many places of
trust and profit: but the Tories were too powerful in the
House of Commons to be exasperated, and therefore a
good number of them were retained in office.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. On the sixth day of the session, the Com∣mons
unanimously resolved to support their Majesties and
their government; to enquire into miscarriages; and to
consider means for preserving the trade of the nation.
The Turkey company were summoned to produce the pe∣titions
they had delivered to the commissioners of the Ad∣miralty
for convoy: Lord Falkland, who sat at the head
of that board, gave in copies of all the orders and di∣rections
sent to Sir George Rooke concerning the Straits
fleet, together with a list of all the ships at that time in
commission. It appeared, in the course of this enquiry,
that the miscarriage of Rooke's fleet was in a great measure
owing to the misconduct of the Admirals, and neglect of
the Victualling-Office: but they were skreened by a ma∣jority.
Mr. Harley, one of the commissioners for taking
and stating the publick accounts, delivered a report, which
contained a charge of peculation against Lord Falkland.
Rainsford, receiver of the rights and perquisites of the
navy, confessed that he had received and paid more money
than that which was charged in the accounts; and, in
particular, that he had paid four thousand pounds to
Lord Falkland, by his Majesty's order. This lord had
acknowledged before the commissioners, that he had paid
one half of the sum, by the King's order, to a person who
<PB N="198" REF="202"/>
was not a member of either House; and that the remainder
was still in his hands. Rainsford owned he had the
original letter which he received from Falkland, demand∣ing
the money; and this nobleman desiring to see it, de∣tained
the voucher; a circumstance that incensed the Com∣mons
to such a degree, that a motion was made for com∣mitting
him to the Tower, and debated with great warmth,
but at last over-ruled by the majority. Nevertheless,
they agreed to make him sensible of their displeasure, and
he was reprimanded in his place. The House of Lords
having also enquired into the causes of the miscarriage at
sea, very violent debates arose, and at length the majority
resolved, that the admirals had done well in the execution
of the orders they had received. This was a triumph
over the Whig lords, who had so eagerly prosecuted the
affair, and now protested against the resolution, not with∣out
great appearance of reason. The next step of the
Lords, was to exculpate the Earl of Nottingham, as the
blame seemed to lie with him, on the supposition that the
admirals were innocent. With a view, therefore, to trans∣fer
this blame to Trenchard, the whiggish secretary, the
Earl gave the House to understand, that he had received
intelligence from Paris in the beginning of June, con∣taining
a list of the enemy's fleet, and the time of their
sailing; that this was communicated to a committee of the
council, and particularly imparted to Secretary Trenchard,
whose province it was to transmit instructions to the ad∣mirals.
Two conferences passed on this subject between
the Lords and Commons. Trenchard delivered in his
defence in writing; and was in his turn skreened by the
whole efforts of the ministry, in which the Whig influ∣ence
now predominated. Thus, an enquiry of such na∣tional
consequence, which took its rise from the King's
own expression of resentment against the delinquents, was
stifled by the arts of the court, because it was likely to af∣fect
one of its creatures: for, though there was no pre∣meditated
treachery in the case, the interest of the publick
was certainly sacrificed to the mutual animosity of the
<PB N="199" REF="203"/>
ministers. The charge of Lord Falkland being resumed
in the House of Commons, he appeared to have begged
and received of the King the remaining two thousand
pounds of the money which had been paid by Rainsford:
he was, therefore, declared guilty of a high misdemeanor
and breach of trust, and committed to the Tower; from
whence, however, he was in two days discharged upon
his petition.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. Harley, Foley, and Harcourt, presented
to the House a state of the receipts and issues of the re∣venue,
together with two reports from the commissioners
of accounts, concerning sums issued for secret-services,
and to members of parliament. This was a discovery of
the most scandalous practices in the mystery of corruption,
equally exercised on the individuals of both parties, in
occasional bounties, grants, places, pensions, equivalents,
and additional salaries. The malcontents, therefore,
justly observed, the House of Commons was so managed
that the King could baffle any bill, quash all grievances,
stifle accounts, and rectify the articles of Limerick.
When the Commons took into consideration the estimates
and supplies of the ensuing year, the King demanded
forty thousand men for the navy, and above one hundred
thousand for the purposes of the land-service. Before the
House considered these enormous demands, they granted
four hundred thousand pounds by way of advance, to
quiet the clamours of the seamen, who were become mu∣tinous
and desperate for want of pay, upwards of one
million being due to them for wages. Then the Com∣mons
voted the number of men required for the navy:
but they were so ashamed of that for the army, that they
thought it necessary to act in such a manner as should
imply that they still retained some regard for their country.
They called for all the treaties subsisting between the
King and his allies: they examined the different pro∣portions
of the troops furnished by the respective powers:
they considered the intended augmentations, and fixed
the establishment of the year at fourscore and three thou∣sand,
<PB N="200" REF="204"/>
one hundred, and twenty-one men, including
officers. For the maintenance of these they allotted the
sum of two millions, five hundred and thirty-thousand, five
hundred, and ninety pounds. They granted two millions
for the navy, and about five hundred thousand pounds to
make good the deficiencies of the annuity and poll-bills;
so that the supplies for the year amounted to about five-millions
and a half, raised by a land-tax of four shillings
in the pound, by two more lives in the annuities, a fur∣ther
excise on beer, a new duty on salt, and a lottery.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. Though the malcontents in parliament
could not withstand this torrent of profusion, they endea∣voured
to distress the court-interest, by reviving the popular
bills of the preceding session; such as that for regulating
trials in cases of high-treason, the other for the more fre∣quent
calling and meeting of parliaments, and that con∣cerning
free and impartial proceedings in parliament. The
first was neglected in the House of Lords; the second was
rejected; the third was passed by the Commons, on the
supposition that it would be defeated in the other House.
The Lords returned it with certain amendments, to which
the Commons would not agree: a conference ensued;
the peers receded from their corrections, and passed the
bill, to which the King, however, refused his assent.
Nothing could be more unpopular and dangerous than
such a step at this juncture. The Commons, in order
to recover some credit with the people, determined to dis∣approve
of his Majesty's conduct. The House formed
itself into a committee, to take the state of the kingdom
into consideration. They resolved, that whoever advised
the King to refuse the royal assent to that bill, was an
enemy to their Majesties and the kingdom. They like∣wise
presented an address, expressing their concern that
he had not given his consent to the bill, and beseeching
his Majesty to hearken for the future to the advice of his
parliament, rather than to the councils of particular per∣sons,
who might have private interests of their own,
separate from those of his Majesty and his people. The
<PB N="201" REF="205"/>
King thanked them for their zeal, professed a warm re∣gard
for their constitution, and assured them he would
look upon all parties as enemies, who should endeavour
to lessen the confidence subsisting between the sovereign
and people. The members in the opposition were not at
all satisfied with this general reply. A day being ap∣pointed
to take it into consideration, a warm debate was
maintained with equal eloquence and acrimony. At length,
the question being put, that an address should be made for
a more explicit answer, it passed in the negative by a
great majority.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The city of London petitioned that a par∣liamentary
provision might be made for the orphans, whose
fortunes they had scandalously squandered away. Such
an application had been made in the preceding session,
and rejected with disdain, as an imposition on the publick:
but now those scruples were removed, and the House
passed a bill for this purpose, consisting of many clauses,
extending to different charges on the city lands, aqueducts,
and personal estates; imposing duties on binding appren∣tices,
constituting freemen, as also upon wines and coals
imported into London. On the twenty-third day of
March these bills received the royal assent; and the King
took that opportunity of recommending dispatch, as the
season of the year was far advanced, and the enemy dili∣gently
employed in making preparations for an early cam∣paign.
The scheme of a national bank, like those of
Amsterdam and Genoa, had been recommended to the
ministry, as an excellent institution, as well for the credit
and security of the government, as for the increase of trade
and circulation. One project was invented by Dr. Hugh
Chamberlain, proposing the circulation of tickets on land-security:
but William Paterson was author of that which
was carried into execution by the interest of Michael
Godfrey, and other active projectors. The scheme was
founded on the notion of a transferable fund, and a circu∣lation
by bill on the credit of a large capital. Forty mer∣chants
subscribed to the amount of five hundred thousand
<PB N="202" REF="206"/>
pounds, as a fund of ready money, to circulate one million
at eight per cent. to be lent to the government; and even
this fund of ready money bore the same interest. When
it was properly digested in the cabinet, and a majority in
parliament secured for its reception, the undertakers for
the court introduced it into the House of Commons, and
expatiated upon the national advantages that would accrue
from such a measure. They said it would rescue the
nation out of the hands of extortioners and usurers, lower
interest, raise the value of land, revive and establish pub∣lick
credit, extend circulation, consequently improve
commerce, facilitate the annual supplies, and connect the
people the more closely with the government. The
project was violently opposed by a strong party, who af∣firmed
that it would become a monopoly, and engross the
whole money of the kingdom: that, as it must infallibly
be subservient to government-views, it might be employed
to the worst purposes of arbitrary power: that, instead of
assisting, it would weaken commerce, by tempting people
to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in
stock-jobbing: that it would produce a swarm of brokers
and jobbers to prey upon their fellow-creatures, encourage
fraud and gaming, and further corrupt the morals of the
nation. Notwithstanding these objections, the bill made
its way through the two Houses, establishing the funds
for the security and advantage of the subscribers; empow∣ering
their Majesties to incorporate them by the name of
The Governor and Company of the Bank of England,
under a proviso, that at any time after the first day of
August, in the year one thousand seven hundred and five,
upon a year's notice, and the repayment of the twelve
hundred thousand pounds, the said corporation should
cease and determine. The bill likewise contained clauses
of appropriation for the services of the publick. The
whole subscription was filled in ten days after its being
opened; and the court of directors completed the pay∣ment
before the expiration of the time prescribed by the
act, although they did not call in more than seven hun∣dred
<PB N="203" REF="207"/>
and twenty thousand pounds of the money sub∣scribed.
All these funds proving inadequate to the
estimates, the Commons brought in a bill to impose
stamp duties upon all vellum, parchment, and paper,
used in almost every kind of intercourse between man and
man; and they crowned the oppressions of the year with
another grievous tax upon carriages, under the name of a
bill for licensing and regulating hackney and stage-coaches.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The Commons, in a clause of the bill for
taxing several joint-stocks, provided, that in case of a
default in the payment of that tax, within the time li∣mitted
by the act, the charter of the company so faling
should be deemed void and forfeited. The East-India
company actually neglected their payment, and the pub∣lick
imagined the ministry would seise this opportunity
of dissolving a monopoly against which so many complaints
had been made: but the directors understood their own
strength, and, instead of being broke, obtained the pro∣mise
of a new charter. This was no sooner known, than
the controversy between them and their adversaries was
revived with such animosity, that the council thought
proper to indulge both parties with a hearing. As this
produced no resolution, the merchants who opposed the
company petitioned, that, in the mean while, the new
charter might be suspended. Addresses of the same kind
were presented by a great number of clothiers, linen∣drapers,
and other dealers. To these a written answer
was published by the company: the merchants printed a
reply, in which they undertook to prove, that the com∣pany
had been guilty of unjust and unwarrantable actions,
tending to the scandal of religion, the dishonour of the
nation, the reproach of our laws, the oppression of the
people, and the ruin of the trade. They observed, that
two private ships had exported in one year three times as
many cloths as the company had exported in three years.
They offered to send more cloth and English merchandise
to the Indies in one year, than the company had exported
<PB N="204" REF="208"/>
in five; to furnish the government with five hundred tons
of salt-petre for less than one half of the usual price; and
they represented, that the company could neither load the
ships they petitioned for in England, nor reload them in
the East-Indies. In spite of all these remonstrances, the
new charter passed the great seal; though the grants con∣tained
in it were limited in such a manner, that they did
not amount to an exclusive privilege, and subjected the
company to such alterations, restrictions, and qualifica∣tions,
as the King should direct before the twenty-ninth
day of September. This indulgence, and other favours
granted to the company, were privately purchased of the
ministry, and became productive of a loud outcry against
the government. The merchants published a journal of
the whole transaction, and petitioned the House of Com∣mons
that their liberty of trading to the East-Indies might
be confirmed by parliament. Another petition was pre∣sented
by the company, praying that their charter might
receive a parliamentary sanction. Both parties employed
all their address in making private application to the
members. The House having examined the differen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
charters, the book of their new subscriptions, and every
particular relating to the company, resolved that all the
subjects of England had an equal right to trade to the East-Indies,
unless prohibited by act of parliament.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. But nothing engrossed the attention of the
publick more than a bill which was brought into the
House for a general naturalization of all foreign protestants▪
The advocates for this measure alledged, That great par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the lands of England lay uncultivated: That the
strength of a nation consisted in the number of inhabi∣tants:
That the people were thinned by the war and
foreign voyages, and required an extraordinary supply▪
That great number of protestants, persecuted in France
and other countries, would gladly remove to a land o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
freedom, and bring along with them their wealth and ma∣nufactures:
That the community had been largely re¦paid
for the protection granted to those refugees who had
<PB N="205" REF="209"/>
already settled in the kingdom. They had introduced
several new branches of manufacture, promoted industry,
and lowered the price of labour; a circumstance of the
utmost importance to trade, oppressed as it was with taxes,
and exposed to uncommon hazard from the enemy. The
opponents of the bill urged with great vehemence, That
it would cheapen the birthright of Englishmen: That
the want of culture was owing to the oppression of the
times: That foreigners being admitted into the privileges
of the British trade, would grow wealthy at the expense of
their benefactors, and transfer the fortunes they had
gained into their native country: That the reduction in
the price of labour would be a national grievance, while
many thousands of English manufacturers were starving
for want of employment, and the price of provisions con∣tinued
so high, that even those who were employed could
scarce supply their families with bread: That the real
design of the bill was to make such an accession to the
dissenters as would render them an equal match in the
body-politic for those of the church of England; to create
a greater dependence on the crown, and, in a word, to
supply a foreign head with foreign members. Sir John
Knight, a member of the House, in a speech upon this
subject, exaggerated the bad consequences that would
attend such a bill, with all the wit and virulence of satire:
it was printed and dispersed through the kingdom, and
raised such a flame among the people as had not appeared
since the Revolution. They exclaimed, that all offices
would be conferred upon Dutchmen, who would become
Lord-danes, and prescribe the modes of religion and
government; and they extolled Sir John Knight as the
saviour of the nation. The courtiers, incensed at the
progress of this clamour, complained in the House of the
speech which had been printed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Feuquieres. Life of King William. Tindal. State Tracts. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> and Sir John was
threatened with expulsion and imprisonment. He, there∣fore,
thought proper to disown the paper, which was
burned by the hands of the common hangman. This
sacrifice served only to increase the popular disturbance,
<PB N="206" REF="210"/>
which rose to such a height of violence, that the court-party
began to tremble; and the bill was dropped for the
present.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. Lord Coningsby and Mr. Porter had com∣mitted
the most flagrant acts of oppression in Ireland.
These had been explained during the last session, by the
gentlemen who appealed against the administration of
Lord Sidney: but they were screened by the ministry;
and, therefore, the Earl of Bellamont now impeached
them in the House of Commons, of which he and they
were members. After an examination of the articles ex∣hibited
against them, the Commons, who were by this
time at the devotion of the court, declared, that, consi∣dering
the state of affairs in Ireland, they did not think
them fit grounds for an impeachment.—In the course of
this session, the nation sustained another misfortune in the
fate of Sir Francis Wheeler, who had been appointed
commander in chief of the Mediterranean squadron. He
received instructions to take under his convoy the merchant¦ships
bound to Turkey, Spain, and Italy; to cruise
thirty days in a certain latitude, for the protection of the
Spanish plate-fleet homeward bound; to leave part of his
squadron at Cadix, as convoy to the trade for England
to proceed with the rest to the Mediterranean; to join the
Spanish fleet in his return, and to act in concert with
them, until he should be joined by the fleet from Turkey
and the Straits, and accompany them back to England▪
About the latter end of October he set sail from St▪
Helen's, and in January arrived at Cadix with the ship
under his convoy. There leaving Rear-Admiral Hopsor
he proceeded for the Mediterranean. In the bay of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>braltar
he was overtaken by a dreadful tempest, under
lee-shore, which he could not possibly weather, and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the ground was so foul that no anchor would hold. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
expedient, however, was tried. A great number of ship
were driven ashore, and many perished. The Admiral¦ship
foundered at sea, and he and all his crew were burit
in the deep, except two Moors, who were miraculous
<PB N="207" REF="211"/>
preserved. Two other ships of the line, three ketches,
and six merchant ships, were lost. The remains of the
fleet were so much shattered, that, instead of prosecuting
their voyage, they returned to Cadix, in order to be re∣fitted,
and sheltered from the attempts of the French
squadrons, which were still at sea, under the command
of Chateau-Renaud and Gabaret. On the twenty-fifth
day of April the King closed the session with a speech in
the usual stile, and the parliament was prorogued to the
eighteenth day of September<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Besides the bills already mentioned, the parliament in this session passed an act for taking and stating the publick accounts—another to encourage ship building—a third for the better disciplining the navy—the usual militia act—and an act enabling his Majesty to make grants and leases in the duchy of Cornwall. One was also passed for renewing a clause in an old statute, limiting the number of justices of the peace in the principality of Wales. The Duke of Norfolk brought an action into the court of King's-Bench against Mr. Germaine, for criminal conversation with his Duchess. The cause was tried, and the jury brought in their verdict for one hundred marks, and costs of suit, in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Before the King embarked, he gratified a good number of his friends with promotions. Lord Charles Butler, brother to the Duke of Ormond, was created Lord Butler, of Weston in England, and Earl of Arran in Ire∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and. The Earl of Shrewsbury was honoured with the title of duke. The Earl of Mulgrave, being reconciled to the court-measures, was gratified with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pension of three thousand pounds, and the title of Marquis of Normanby. Henry Herbert was e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nobled by the title of Baron Herbert, of Cherbury. The Earls of Bedford, Devonshire, and Clare were promoted to the rank of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ukes. The Marquis of Caermarthen was made Duke of Leeds, Lord Viscount Sidney, created Earl of Romney, and Viscount Newport, Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edford. Russel was advanced to the head of the Admiralty-board. Sir George Rooke and Sir John Houblon were appointed joint commissioners, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he room of Killegrew and Delaval. Charles Montagu was made Chan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellor of the Exchequer; and Sir William Trumbal and John Smith com∣missioners of the Treasury, in the room of Sir Edward Seymour and Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ambden.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. Louis of France being tired of the war,
which had impoverished his country, continued to tamper
with the Duke of Savoy, and, by the canal of the Pope,
made some offers to the King of Spain, which were re∣jected.
Mean while he resolved to stand upon the de∣fensive
during the ensuing campaign, in every part but
Catalonia, where his whole naval force might co-operate
<PB N="208" REF="212"/>
with the Count de Noailles, who commanded the land-army.
King William having received intelligence of the
design upon Barcelona, endeavoured to prevent the
junction of the Brest and Toulon squadrons, by sending
Russel to sea as early as the fleet could be in a condition
to sail: but, before he arrived at Portsmouth, the Brest
squadron had quitted that harbour. On the third day of
May the Admiral sailed from St. Helen's, with the com∣bined
squadrons of England and Holland, amounting to
ninety ships of the line, besides frigates, fire-ships, and
tenders. He detached Captain Pritchard of the Mon∣mouth
with two fire-ships, to destroy a fleet of French
merchant-ships near Conquet-bay; and this service being
performed, he returned to St. Helen's, where he had left
Sir Cloudessey Shovel with a squadron, to take on board
a body of land-forces, intended for a descent upon the
coast of France. These being embarked, under the com∣mand
of General Ptolemache, the whole fleet sailed again
on the twenty-ninth of May. The land and sea-officers,
in a council of war, agreed that part of the fleet designed
for this expedition, should separate from the rest, and pro∣ceed
to Camaret bay, where the forces should be landed.
On the fifth day of June, Lord Berkeley, who com∣manded
this squadron, parted with the grand fleet, and on
the seventh anchored between the bays of Camaret and
Bertaume. Next day the Marquis of Caermarthen, after∣wards
Duke of Leeds, who served under Berkeley, as rear-admiral
of the blue, entered Camaret bay with two large
ships and six frigates, to cover the troops in landing. The
French had received intelligence of the design, and taken
such precautions, under the conduct of the celebrated
engineer, Vauban, that the English were exposed to a
terrible fire from new-erected batteries, as well as from
a strong body of troops; and though the ships canno∣naded
them with great vigour, the soldiers could not main∣tain
any regularity in landing. A good number were
killed in the open boats before they reached the shore; and
those who landed were soon repulsed, in spite of all the
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
endeavours of General Ptolemache,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1694.</NOTE> who received a wound
in the thigh, which proved mortal. Seven hundred sol∣diers
are said to have been lost on this occasion, besides
those who were killed on board of the ships. The Monk
ship of war was towed off with great difficulty: but a
Dutch frigate of thirty guns fell into the hands of the
enemy.</P>
<P>§ XL. After this unfortunate attempt, Lord Berkeley,
with the advice of a council of war, sailed back for Eng∣land,
and at St. Helen's received orders from the Queen
to call a council, and deliberate in what manner the ships
and forces might be best employed. They agreed to
make some attempt upon the coast of Normandy. With
this view they set sail on the fifth day of July. They
bombarded Dieppe, and reduced the greatest part of the
town to ashes. Thence they steered to Havre-de-Grace,
which met with the same fate. They harrassed the French
troops, who marched after them along-shore. They alarm∣ed
the whole coast, and filled every town with such con∣sternation,
that they would have been abandoned by the
inhabitants, had not they been detained by military force.
On the twenty-sixth day of July, Lord Berkeley returned
to St. Helen's, where he quitted the fleet, and the com∣mand
devolved upon Sir Cloudesley Shovel. This officer
having received instructions to make an attempt upon
Dunkirk, sailed round to the Downs, where he was joined
by M. Meesters, with six-and-twenty Dutch pilots. On
the twelfth of September he appeared before Dunkirk;
and next day sent in the Charles galley, with two bomb-ketches,
and as many of the machines called Infernals.
These were set on sire without effect; and the design mis∣carried:
then Shovel steered for Calais, which having
bombarded with little success, he returned to the coast of
England; and the bomb-ketches and machinee were sent
into the river Thames.</P>
<P>§ XLI. During these transactions, Admiral Russel, with
the grand fleet, sailed for the Mediterranean; and being
joined by Rear-Admiral Neville from Cadiz, together
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>
with Callembergh and Evertzen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1694.</NOTE> he steered towards Bar∣celona,
which was besieged by the French fleet and army.
At his approach Tourville retired with precipitation into
the harbour of Toulon; and Noailles abandoned his en∣terprise.
The Spanish affairs were in such a deplorable
condition, that without this timely assistance the kingdom
must have been undone. While he continued in the Me∣diterranean,
the French Admiral durst not venture to
appear at sea; and all his projects were disconcerted. Af∣ter
having asserted the honour of the British flag in those
seas during the whole summer, he sailed in the beginning
of November to Cadix, where, by an express order of the
King, he passed the winter, during which, he took such
precautions for preventing Tourville from passing the
Straits, that he did not think proper to risque the passage.</P>
<P>§ XLII. It will now be necessary to describe the ope∣rations
on the continent. In the middle of May King
William arrived in Holland, where he consulted with the
States-General. On the third day of June he repaired to
Bethlem-abbey near Louvain, the place appointed for
the rendezvous of the army: and there he was met by
the Electors of Bavaria and Cologn. In a few days, a
numerous army was assembled; and every thing seemed
to promise an active campaign. On the third day of June
the Dauphin assumed the command of the French for∣ces,
with which Luxembourg had taken post between
Mons and Maubeuge; and passing the Sambre, encamped
at Fleurus: but, on the eighteenth, he removed from
thence, and took up his quarters between St. Tron and
Wanheim; while the confederates lay at Roosbeck. On
the eleventh of July, the Dauphin marched in four co∣lumns
to Oerle upon the Jarr, where he pitched his
camp. On the twenty-second, the confederates marched
to Bomale: then the Dauphin took the route to Vigna∣mont,
where he secured his army by entrenchments, as
his forces were inferior in number to those of the allies;
and he had been directed by his father to avoid an engage∣ment.
In this situation both armies remained till the
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
fifteenth day of August, when King William sent the
heavy baggage to Louvain; and on the eighteenth made
a motion to Sombref. This was no sooner known to the
enemy, than they decamped; and having marched all
night, posted themselves between Temploux and Masy,
within a mile and a half of the confederates. The King of
England resolved to pass the Scheld; and with this view
marched, by the way of Nivelle and Soignies, to Chievres:
from thence he detached the Duke of Wirtemberg,
with a strong body of horse and foot, to pass the river at
Oudenarde, while the Elector of Bavaria advanced with
another detachment, to pass it at Pont d'Espieres. Not∣withstanding
all the expedition they could make, their
purpose was anticipated by Luxembourg, who being ap∣prised
of their route, had detached four thousand horse,
with each a foot soldier behind the trooper, to re-enforce
M. de Valette, who commanded that part of the French
line. These were sustained by a choice body of men, who
travelled with great expedition, without observing the for∣malities
of a march. Mareschal de Villeroy followed the
same route, with all the cavalry of the right wing, the
houshold troops, and twenty field-pieces; and the rest
of the army was brought up by the Dauphin in person.
They marched with such incredible diligence, that the
Elector of Bavaria could scarce believe his own eyes,
when he arrived in sight of the Scheld, and saw them en∣trenching
themselves on the other side of the river. King
William having reconnoitered their disposition, thought it
impracticable to pass at that place, and therefore marched
down the river to Oudenarde, where a passage had been
already effected by the Duke of Wirtemberg. Here the
confederates passed the Scheld on the twenty-seventh day
of the month; and the King fixed his head-quarters at
Wanneghem. His intention was to have taken possession of
Courtray, and establish winter-quarters for a conside∣rable
part of his army in that district: but, Luxembourg
having posted himself between that place and Menin, ex∣tended
his lines in such a manner, that the confederates
<PB N="212" REF="216"/>
could not attempt to force them, nor even hinder him
from subsisting his army at the expense of the Castellany
of Courtray, during the remainder of the campaign. This
surprising march was of such importance to the French
King, that he wrote with his own hand a letter of thanks
to his army; and ordered that it should be read to every
particular squadron and battalion.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The King of England, though disappointed
in his scheme upon Courtray, found means to make some
advantage of his superiority in number. He drafted troops
from the garrisons of Liege and Maestricht; and on the
third day of September re-enforced this body with a large
detachment from his own camp, conferring the command
upon the Duke of Holstein-Ploen, with orders to under∣take
the siege of Huy. Next day, the whole confederate
forces passed the Lys, and encamped at Wouterghen.
From thence the King, with part of the army, marched
to Roselaer: this division obliged the Dauphin to make
considerable detachments, for the security of Ypres
and Menin on one side, and to cover Furnes and Dunkirk
on the other. At this juncture, a Frenchman being seized
in the very act of setting sire to one of the ammunition-waggons
in the allied army, confessed he had been em∣ployed
for this purpose by some of the French generals,
and suffered death as a traitor. On the sixteenth day of
the month, the Duke of Holstein-Ploen invested Huy,
and carried on the siege with such vigour, that in ten days
the garrison capitulated. The King ordered Dixmuyde,
Deynse, Ninove, and Tirlemont, to be secured for winter∣quarters
to part of the army: the Dauphin returned to
Versailles; William quitted the camp on the last day of
September; and both armies broke up about the middle
of October.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The operations on the Rhine were precon∣certed
between King William and the Prince of Baden,
who had visited London in the winter. The dispute be∣tween
the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony was com∣promised;
and this young prince dying during the negoci∣ation,
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
the treaty was perfected by his brother and suc∣cessor,
who engaged to furnish twelve thousand men yearly,
in consideration of a subsidy from the court of Vienna.
In the beginning of June, Mareschal de Lorges passed the
Rhine at Philipsburgh, in order to give battle to the Im∣perialists,
encamped at Hailbron. The Prince of Baden,
who was not yet joined by the Saxons, Hessians, nor by
the troops of Munster and Paderborn, dispatched couriers
to quicken the march of these auxiliaries, and advanced to
Eppingen, where he proposed to wait till they should come
up: but, on the fifteenth, receiving undoubted intelli∣gence,
that the enemy were in motion towards him, he
advanced to meet them in order of battle. De Lorges
concluded that this was a desperate effort, and immedi∣ately
halted, to make the necessary preparations for an en∣gagement.
This pause enabled Prince Louis to take pos∣session
of a strong pass near Sintzheim, from which he
could not easily be dislodged. Then the Mareschal pro∣ceeded
to Viseloch, and ravaged the adjacent country, in
hopes of drawing the Imperialists from their entrench∣ments.
The Prince being joined by the Hessians, resolved
to beat up the quarters of the enemy; and the French
general being apprised of his design, retreated at midnight
with the utmost precipitation. Having posted himself at
Ruth, he sent his heavy baggage to Philipsburgh: then he
moved to Gonsbergh, in the neighbourhood of Manheim,
repassed the Rhine, and encamped between Spires and
Worms. The Prince of Baden being joined by the
allies, passed the river by a bridge of boats near Hagen∣bach,
in the middle of September; and laid the country
of Alsace under contribution. Considering the advanced
season of the year, this was a rash undertaking; and the
French general resolved to profit by his enemy's temerity.
He forthwith advanced against the Imperialists, foreseeing
that should they be worsted in battle, their whole army
would be ruined. Prince Louis, informed of his intention,
immediately repassed the Rhine; and this retreat was no
sooner effected, than the river swelled to such a degree,
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
that the island in the middle, and great part of the camp
he had occupied, was overflowed. Soon after this inci∣dent,
both armies retired into winter-quarters. The cam∣paign
in Hungary produced no event of importance. It
was opened by the new Visir, who arrived at Belgrade in
the middle of August: and about the same time Caprara
assembled the Imperial army in the neighbourhood of
Peterwaradin. The Turks passed the Saave, in order to
attack their camp, and carried on their approaches with
five hundred pieces of cannon; but made very little pro∣gress.
The Imperialists received re-enforcements; the
season wasted away; a feud arose between the Visir and
the Cham of the Tartars; and the Danube being swelled
by heavy rains, so as to interrupt the operations of the
Turks, their general decamped in the night of the first of
October. They afterwards made an unsuccessful attempt
upon Titul, while the Imperial general made himself
master of Giula. In the course of this summer, the Ve∣netians,
who were also at war with the Turks, reduced
Cyclut, a place of importance on the river Naranta, and
made a conquest of the island of Scio in the Archipelago.</P>
<P>§ XLV. We have already observed, that the French
King had determined to act vigorously in Catalonia. In
the beginning of May, the Duke de Noailles advanced at
the head of eight-and-twenty thousand men to the river
Ter, on the opposite bank of which the viceroy of Cata∣lonia
was encamped with sixteen thousand Spaniards. The
French general passed the river in the face of this army,
and attacked their entrenchments with such impetuosity,
that in less than an hour they were totally defeated.
Then he marched to Palamos, and undertook the siege of
that place, while at the same time it was blocked up by
the combined squadrons of Brest and Toulon. Though
the besieged made an obstinate defence, the town was
taken by storm, the houses were pillaged, and the people
put to the sword, without distinction of age, sex, or con∣dition.
Then he invested Gironne, which in a few days
capitulated. Ostalric met with the same fate, and Noailles
<PB N="215" REF="219"/>
was created viceroy of Catalonia by the French King. In
the beginning of August he distributed his forces into
quarters of refreshment, along the river Terdore, resolv∣ing
to undertake the siege of Barcelona, which was saved
by the arrival of Admiral Russel. The war languished in
Piedmont, on account of a secret negociation between the
King of France and the Duke of Savoy: notwithstand∣ing
the remonstrances of Rouvigny, Earl of Galway, who
had succeeded the Duke of Schomberg in the command of
the British forces in that country. Casal was closely
blocked up by the reduction of Fort St. George, and the
Vaudois gained the advantage in some skirmishes in the
valley of Ragelas: but no design of importance was exe∣cuted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this year, M. du Casse, governor of St. Domingo, made an unsuccessful attempt upon the island of Jamaica; and M. St. Clair, with four men of war, formed a design against St. John's, Newfound∣land; but he was repulsed with loss, by the valour of the inhabitants.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. England had continued very quiet under the
Queen's administration, if we except some little commo∣tions
occasioned by the practices, or pretended practices,
of the Jacobites. Prosecutions were revived against cer∣tain
gentlemen of Lancashire and Cheshire, for having
been concerned in the conspiracy formed in favour of the
late King's projected invasion from Normandy. These
steps were owing to the suggestions of infamous informers,
whom the ministry countenanced. Colonel Parker and
one Crosby were imprisoned, and bills of treason found
against them: but Parker made his escape from the
Tower, and was never retaken, though a reward of four
hundred pounds was set upon his head. The King,
having settled the affairs of the confederacy at the Hague,
embarked for England on the eighth of November, and
next day landed at Margate. On the twelfth he opened
the session of parliament, with a speech, in which he ob∣served
that the posture of affairs was improved both by
sea and land since they last parted; in particular, that a
stop was put to the progress of the French arms. He
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
desired they would continue the act of tonnage and
poundage, which would expire at Christmas: he re∣minded
them of the debt for the transport ships employed
in the reduction of Ireland; and exhorted them to prepare
some good bill for the encouragement of seamen. A ma∣jority
in both Houses was already secured; and in all pro∣bability,
he bargained for their condescension, by agreeing
to the bill for triennial parliaments. This Mr. Harley
brought in, by order of the Lower House, immediately
after their first adjournment; and it kept pace with the
consideration of the supplies. The Commons having
examined the estimates and accounts, voted four millions,
seven hundred sixty-four thousand, seven hundred and
twelve pounds for the service of the army and navy. In
order to raise this sum, they continued the land-tax; they
renewed the subsidy of tonnage and poundage for five
years, and imposed new duties on different commodities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They imposed certain rates and duties upon marriages, births, and burials, bachelors, and widows. They passed an act for laying additional duties upon coffee, tea, and chocolate, towards paying the debt due for the transport ships; and another, imposing duties on glass-wares, stone, and earthen bottles, coal, and culm.</NOTE>.
The triennial bill enacted, That a parliament should be
held once in three years at least: That within three years
at farthest after the dissolution of the parliament then
subsisting, and so from time to time, for ever after, legal
writs under the great seal should be issued, by the direction
of the crown, for calling, assembling, and holding
another new parliament: That no parliament should
continue longer than three years at farthest, to be ac∣counted
from the first day of the first session: and, That
the parliament then subsisting should cease and determine
on the first day of November next following, unless their
Majesties should think fit to dissolve it sooner. The Duke
of Devonshire, the Marquis of Hallifax, the Earls of
Weymouth and Aylesbury, protested against this bill,
because it tended to the continuance of the present parlia∣ment
longer than, as they apprehended, was agreeable to
the constitution of England.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221"/>
§ XLVII. While this bill was depending, Dr. John
Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury, was seised with a
fit of the dead palsy, in the chapel of Whitehall, and
died on the twenty-second day of November, deeply re∣gretted
by the King and Queen, who shed tears of sorrow
at his decease; and sincerely lamented by the publick, as a
pattern of elegance, ingenuity, meekness, charity, and
moderation. These qualities he must be allowed to have
possessed, notwithstanding the invectives of his enemies,
who accused him of puritanism, flattery, and ambition;
and charged him with having conduced to a dangerous
schism in the church, by accepting the Archbishoprick
during the life of the deprived Sancroft. He was suc∣ceeded
in the metropolitan see by Dr. Tenison, Bishop of
Lincoln, recommended by the Whig-party, which now
predominated in the cabinet. The Queen did not long
survive her favourite prelate. In about a month after his
decease, she was taken ill of the small-pox, and the
symptoms proving dangerous, she prepared herself for
death with great composure. She spent some time in exer∣cises
of devotion, and private conversation with the new
Archbishop: she received the sacrament with all the
Bishops who were in attendance; and expired on the
twenty-eighth day of December, in the thirty-third year
of her age, and in the sixth of her reign, to the inex∣pressible
grief of the King, who for some weeks after her
death could neither see company, nor attend to the busi∣ness
of state. Mary was in her person tall and well-pro∣portioned,
with an oval visage, lively eyes, agreeable
features, a mild aspect, and an air of dignity. Her ap∣prehension
was clear, her memory tenacious, and her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgement solid. She was a zealous protestant, scrupu∣lously
exact in all the duties of devotion, of an even
temper, and of a calm and mild conversation. She was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussled by no passion, and seems to have been a stranger
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the emotions of natural affection; for she ascended,
without compunction, the throne from which her father
had been deposed, and treated her sister as an alien to her
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>
blood. In a word, Mary seems to have imbibed the cold
disposition and apathy of her husband; and to have cen∣tered
all her ambition in deserving the epithet of an hum∣ble
and obedient wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her obsequies were performed with great magnificence. The body was attended from Whitehall to Westminster-abbey by all the Judges, Ser∣jeants at Law, the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of the city of London, and both Houses of Parliament; and the funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury. Dr. Kenn, the deprived Bishop of Bath and Wells, reproached him in a letter, for not having called upon her Majesty on her death-bed to repent of the share she had in the Revo∣lution. This was answered by another pamphlet. One of the Jacobite clergy insulted the Queen's memory, by preaching on the following text, “Go, now, see this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a King's daughter.” On the other hand, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Com∣mon Council of London came to a resolution to erect her statue, with that of the King, in the Royal-Exchange.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. The Princess Anne being informed of the
Queen's dangerous indisposition, sent a lady of her bed∣chamber,
to desire she might be admitted to her Majesty;
but this request was not granted. She was thanked for
her expression of concern; and given to understand, that
the physicians had directed that the queen should be kept
as quiet as possible. Before her death, however she sent
a forgiving message to her sister; and after her decease,
the Earl of Sunderland effected a reconciliation between
the King and the Princess, who visited him at Kensington,
where she was received with uncommon civility. He ap∣pointed
the palace of St. James's for her residence, and
presented her with the greater part of the Queen's jewels.
But a mutual jealousy and disgust subsisted under these
exteriors of friendship and esteem. The two Houses of
parliament waited on the King at Kensington, with con∣solatory
addresses on the death of his consort: their exam∣ple
was followed by the regency of Scotland, the city and
clergy of London, the dissenting ministers, and almost all
the great corporations in England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Earls of Rochester and Nottingham are said to have started a doubt, Whether the parliament was not dissolved by the Queen's death? but this dangerous motion met with no countenance.</NOTE>.</P>

§ I. THE kingdom now resounded with the com∣plaints
of the papists and malcontents, who
taxed the ministry with subornation of perjury, in the
case of the Lancashire gentlemen who had been prosecuted
for the conspiracy. One Lunt, an Irishman, had informed
Sir John Trenchard, secretary of state, that he had been
sent from Ireland, with commissions from King James to
divers gentlemen in Lancashire and Cheshire: that he had
assisted in buying arms, and enlisting men to serve that king
in his projected invasion of England: that he had been
twice dispatched by those gentlemen to the court of St.
Germain's, assisted many Jacobites in repairing to France,
helped to conceal others that came from that kingdom;
and that all those persons told him they were furnished
with money by Sir John Friend to defray the expense
<PB N="221" REF="225"/>
of their expedition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1694.</NOTE> His testimony was confirmed by
other infamous emissaries, who received but too much
countenance from the government. Blank warrants were
issued, and filled up occasionally with such names as the
informers suggested. These were delivered to Aaron
Smith, sollicitor to the Treasury, who, with messengers,
accompanied Lunt and his associates to Lancashire, under
the protection of a party of Dutch horse guards, com∣manded
by one Captain Baker. They were empowered
to break open houses, seise papers, and apprehend persons,
according to their pleasure; and they committed many
acts of violence and oppression. The persons against
whom these measures were taken, being apprised of the
impending danger, generally retired from their own habi∣tations.
Some, however, were taken and imprisoned: a
few arms were secured; and, in the House of Mr. Standish,
at Standish-hall, they found the draft of a declaration to
be published by King James at his landing. As this pro∣secution
seemed calculated to revive the honour of a stale
conspiracy, and the evidences were persons of abandoned
characters, the friends of those who were persecuted, found
no great difficulty in rendering the scheme odious to the
nation. They even employed the pen of Ferguson, who
had been concerned in every plot that was hatched since
the Rye-house conspiracy. This veteran, though appoint∣ed
house-keeper to the Excise-office, thought himself
poorly recompensed for the part he had acted in the Revo∣lution,
became dissatisfied, and, upon this occasion, pub∣lished
a letter to Sir John Trenchard, on the abuse of
power. It was replete with the most bitter invectives
against the ministry, and contained a great number of
flagrant instances, in which the court had countenanced
the vilest corruption, perfidy, and oppression. This pro∣duction
was in every body's hand, and had such an effect
upon the people, that when the prisoners were brought to
tryal at Manchester, the populace would have put the
witnesses to death, had not they been prevented by the inter∣position
of those who were friends to the accused persons,
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>
and had already taken effectual measures for their safety.
Lunt's chief associate in the mystery of information was one
Taaffe, a wretch of the most profligate principles, who,
finding himself disappointed in his hope of reward from the
ministry, was privately gained over by the agents for the
prisoners. Lunt, when desired in court to point out the
persons whom he had accused, committed such a mistake
as greatly invalidated his testimony; and Taaffe declared
before the bench, that the pretended plot was no other than
a contrivance between himself and Lunt, in order to pro∣cure
money from the government. The prisoners were
immediately acquitted, and the ministry incurred a heavy
load of popular odium, as the authors or abettors of kna∣vish
contrivances to ensnare the innocent. The govern∣ment,
with a view to evince their abhorrence of such
practices, ordered the witnesses to be prosecuted for a con∣spiracy
against the lives and estates of the gentlemen who
had been accused; and at last the affair was brought into
the House of Commons. The Jacobites triumphed in their
victory. They even turned the battery of corruption upon
the evidence for the crown, not without making a con∣siderable
impression. But the cause was now debated be∣fore
judges who were not all propitious to their views.
The Commons having set on foot an enquiry, and exami∣ned
all the papers and circumstances relating to the pre∣tended
plot, resolved, That there was sufficient ground
for the prosecution and tryals of the gentlemen at Man∣chester;
and that there was a dangerous conspiracy against
the King and government. They issued an order for
taking Mr. Standish into custody; and the messenger re∣porting
that he was not to be found, they presented an ad∣dress
to the King, desiring a proclamation might be pub∣lished,
offering a reward for apprehending his person. The
Peers concurred with the Commons in their sentiment<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
this affair; for complaints having been laid before their
House also, by the persons who thought themselves aggriev∣ed,
the question was put, Whether the government had
cause to prosecute them? and carried in the affirmative;
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
though a protest was entered against this vote by the Earls
of Rochester and Nottingham. Notwithstanding these
decisions, the accused gentlemen prosecuted Lunt and two
of his accomplices for perjury, at the Lancaster assises; and
all three were found guilty. They were immediately in∣dicted
by the crown, for a conspiracy against the lives and
liberties of the persons they had accused. The intention
of the ministry, in laying this indictment, was to seise the
opportunity of punishing some of the witnesses for the
gentlemen, who had prevaricated in giving their testi∣mony:
but the design being discovered, the Lancashire∣men
refused to produce their evidence against the infor∣mers:
the prosecution dropped of consequence; and
the prisoners were discharged.</P>
<P>§ II. When the Commons were employed in examining
the state of the revenue, and taking measures for raising the
necessary supplies, the inhabitants of Royston presented a
petition, complaining, that the officers and soldiers of the
regiment belonging to Colonel Hastings, which was quar∣tered
upon them, exacted subsistence money, even on pain
of military execution. The House was immediately kind∣led
into a flame by this information. The officers, and
Pauncefort, agent for the regiment, were examined: then
it was unanimously resolved, That such a practice was ar∣bitrary,
illegal, and a violation of the rights and liberties
of the subject. Upon further enquiry, Pauncefort and
some other agents were committed to the custody of the
Serjeant, for having neglected to pay the subsistence-mo∣ney
they had received for the officers and soldiers. He was
afterwards sent to the Tower, together with Henry Guy,
a member of the House, and secretary to the Treasury,
the one for giving, and the other for receiving, a bribe to
obtain the King's bounty. Pauncefort's brother was like∣wise
committed, for being concerned in the same com∣merce.
Guy had been employed, together with Trevor
the Speaker, as the court-agent for securing a majority in
the House of Commons: for that reason, he was obnoxious
to the members in the opposition, who took this oppor∣tunity
<PB N="224" REF="228"/>
to brand him; and the courtiers could not with any
decency skreen him from their vengeance. The House
having proceeded in this enquiry, drew up an address to the
King, enumerating the abuses which had crept into the
army, and demanding immediate redress. He promised to
consider the remonstrance, and redress the grievances of
which they complained. Accordingly he cashiered Co∣lonel
Hastings; appointed a council of officers to sit week∣ly
and examine all complaints against any officer and sol∣dier;
and published a declaration for the maintenance
of strict discipline, and the due payment of quarters.
Notwithstanding these concessions, the Commons prose∣cuted
their examinations: they committed Mr. James
Craggs, one of the contractors for clothing the army,
because he refused to answer upon oath such questions
as might be put to him by the commissioners of accounts.
They brought in a bill for obliging him and Mr. Rich∣ard
Harnage the other contractor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Boyer. Oldmixon. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph. Lives of the Admirals. Daniel. Voltaire.</NOTE> together with the
two Paunceforts, to discover how they had disposed of
the sums paid into their hands on account of the army;
and for punishing them, in case they should persist in
their refusal. At this period, they received a petition
against the commissioners for licensing hackney-coaches.
Three of them, by means of an address to the King,
were removed with disgrace, for having acted arbitrarily,
corruptly, and contrary to the trust reposed in them by
act of parliament.</P>
<P>§ III. Those who encouraged this spirit of reformation
introduced another enquiry about the orphans bill, which
was said to have passed into an act, by virtue of undue
influence. A committee being appointed to inspect the
Chamberlain's books, discovered that bribes had been
given to Sir John Trevor, Speaker of the House, and Mr.
Hungerford, chairman of the grand committee. The first
being voted guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour,
abdicated the chair, and Paul Foley was appointed Speaker
in his room. Then Sir John and Hungerford were ex∣pelled
the House: one Nois, a sollicitor for the hill, was
taken into custody, because he had scandalised the Com∣mons,
<PB N="225" REF="229"/>
in pretending he was engaged to give great sums to
several members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1695.</NOTE> and denying this circumstance on his ex∣amination.
The reformers in the House naturally con∣cluded
that the same arts had been practised in obtaining
the new charter of the East-India company, which had
been granted so much against the sense of the nation. Their
books were subjected to the same committee that carried on
the former enquiry, and a surprising scene of venality and
corruption was soon disclosed. It appeared that the com∣pany,
in the course of the preceding year, had paid near
ninety thousand pounds in secret-services; and that Sir
Thomas Cooke, one of the directors, and a member of
the House, had been the chief manager of this infamous
commerce. Cooke refusing to answer, was committed to
the Tower, and a bill of pains and penalties brought in,
obliging him to discover how the sum mentioned in the
report of the committee had been distributed. The bill
was violently opposed in the Upper House by the Duke of
Leeds, as being contrary to law and equity, and furnishing
a precedent of a dangerous nature. Cooke being, agree∣ably
to his own petition, brought to the bar of the House of
Lords, declared that he was ready and willing to make a full
discovery, in case he might be favoured with an indemni∣fying
vote, to secure him against all actions and suits,
except those of the East-India company, which he had
never injured. The Lords complied with his request,
and passed a bill for this purpose, to which the Commons
added a penal clause; and the former was laid aside.</P>
<P>§ IV. When the King went to the House, to give the
royal assent to the money-bills, he endeavoured to discou∣rage
this enquiry, by telling the parliament that the
season of the year was far advanced and the circumstances
of affairs extremely pressing: he, therefore, desired they
would dispatch such business as they should think of most
importance to the publick, as he should put an end to the
session in a few days. Notwithstanding this shameful in∣terposition,
both Houses appointed a joint committee to
lay open the complicated scheme of fraud and iniquity.
<PB N="226" REF="230"/>
Cooke, on his first examination, confessed, that he had
delivered tallies for ten thousand pounds to Francis Tyssen,
deputy-governour, for the special service of the company;
an equal sum to Richard Acton, for employing his interest
in preventing a new settlement, and endeavouring to esta∣blish
the old company; besides two thousand pounds by
way of interest, and as a further gratuity; a thousand
guineas to Colonel Fitzpatrick, five hundred to Charles
Bates, and three hundred and ten to Mr. Molineux, a
merchant, for the same purposes; and he owned that Sir
Basil Firebrace had received forty thousand pounds on
various pretences. He said, he believed the ten thousand
pounds paid to Tyssen had been delivered to the King by
Sir Josiah Child, as a customary present which former
kings had received; and that the sums paid to Acton were
distributed among some members of parliament. Firebrace
being examined, affirmed that he had received the whole
forty thousand pounds for his own use and benefit; but
that Bates had received sums of money, which he under∣stood
were offered to some persons of the first quality.
Acton declared, that ten thousand pounds of the sum
which he had received was distributed among persons who
had interest with members of parliament; and that great
part of the money passed through the hands of Craggs,
who was acquainted with some colonels in the House and
northern members. Bates owned he had received the
money, in consideration of using his interest with the Duke
of Leeds in favour of the company: that this nobleman
knew of the gratuity; and that the sum was reckoned by
his grace's domestick, one Robart, a foreigner, who kept
it in his possession until this enquiry was talked of, and
then it was returned. In a word, it appeared by this man's
testimony, as well as by that of Firebrace on his second
examination, that the Duke of Leeds was not free from
corruption, and that Sir John Trevor was a hireling
prostitute.</P>
<P>§ V. The report of the committee produced violent al∣tercation,
and the most severe strictures upon the conduct
<PB N="227" REF="231"/>
of the Lord President. At length, the House resolved,
That there was sufficient matter to impeach Thomas Duke
of Leeds of high crimes and misdemeanours; and that he
should be impeached thereupon. Then it was ordered,
That, Mr. Comptroller Wharton should impeach him
before the Lords, in the name of the House, and of all the
Commons in England. The Duke was actually in the
middle of a speech for his own justification, in which he
assured the House, upon his honour, that he was not guilty
of the corruptions laid to his charge, when one of his friends
gave him intimation of the votes which had passed in the
Commons. He concluded his speech abruptly, and re∣pairing
to the Lower-House, desired he might be indulged
with a hearing. He was accordingly admitted, with the
compliment of a chair, and leave to be covered. After
having sat a few minutes, he took off his hat, and addressed
himself to the Commons in very extraordinary terms.
Having thanked them for the favour of indulging him with
a hearing, he said that House would not have been then
sitting but for him. He protested his own innocence, with
respect to the crime laid to his charge. He complained that
this was the effect of a design which had been long formed
against him. He expressed a deep sense of his being under
the displeasure of the parliament and nation, and demanded
speedy justice. They forthwith drew up the articles of
impeachment, which being exhibited at the bar of the
Upper House, he pleaded not guilty, and the Commons
promised to make good their charge: but, by this time,
such arts had been used, as all at once checked the violence
of the prosecution. Such a number of considerable per∣sons
were involved in this mystery of corruption, that a
full discovery was dreaded by both parties. The Duke
sent his domestick, Robart, out of the kingdom, and his
absence furnished a pretence for postponing the tryal. In
a word, the enquiry was dropped; but the scandal stuck
fast to the Duke's character.</P>
<P>§ VI. In the midst of these deliberations, the King went
to the House on the third day of May, when he thanked
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
parliament for the supplies they had granted; signifying his
intention of going abroad; assured them he would place the
administration of affairs in persons of known care and fide∣lity;
and desired that the members of both Houses would
be more than ordinarily vigilant in preserving the publick
peace. The parliament was then prorogued to the eigh∣teenth
of June.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the course of this session, the Lords had enquired into the particulars of the Mediterranean expedition, and presented an address to the King, de∣claring, that the fleet in those seas had conduced to the honour and advantage of the nation. On the other hand, the Commons, in an address, besought his Majesty to take care that the kingdom might be put on an equal footing and proportion with the allies, in defraying the expense of the war.</P>
<P>The coin of the kingdom being greatly diminished and adulterated, the Earls of Rochester and Nottingham expatiated upon this national evil in the House of Lords; and an act was passed, containing severer penalties against clippers: but this produced no good effect. The value of money sunk in the exchange to such a degree, that a guinea was reckoned adequate to thirty shillings; and this publick disgrace lowered the credit of the funds and of the government. The nation was alarmed by the circulation of fictitious wealth, instead of gold and silver, such as bank-bills, Exchequer tallies, and govern∣ment securities. The malcontents took this opportunity to exclaim against the Bank, and even attempted to shake the credit of it in parliament: but their endeavours proved abortive: the monied-interest preponderated in both Houses.</P></NOTE>. The King immediately appointed a re∣gency
to govern the kingdom in his absence: but neither
the Princess of Denmark nor her husband were entrusted
with any share in the administration; a circumstance
that evinced the King's jealousy, and gave offense to a
great part of the nation.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The regency was composed of the Archbishop of Canterbury; Somers, lord-keeper of the great seal; the Earl of Pembroke, lord-privy-seal; the Duke of Devonshire, lord-sleward of the household; the Duke of Shrews∣bury, secretary of state; the Earl of Dorset, lord chamberlain; and the Lord Godolphin, first commissioner of the Treasury. Sir John Trenchard dying, his place of secretary was filled with Sir William Trumb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, an eminent civil∣ian, learned, diligent, and virtuous, who had been envoy at Paris and Con∣stantinople. William Nassau de Zuylestein, son of the King's natural uncle, was created Baron of Enfield, Viscount Tunbridge, and Earl of Rochford. Ford, Lord Grey of Worke, was made Viscount Glendale, and Earl of Tan∣kerville. The month of April of this year was distinguished by the death of the famous George Saville, Marquis of Hallisax, who had survived in a good measure his talents and reputation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="233"/>
§ VII. A session of parliament was deemed necessary in
Scotland, to provide new subsidies for the maintenance of
the troops of that kingdom, which had been so serviceable
in the prosecution of the war. But, as a great outcry
had been raised against the government, on account of the
massacre of Glencoe, and the Scots were tired of contri∣buting
towards the expense of a war from which they
could derive no advantage, the ministry thought proper to
cajole them with the promise of some national indulgence.
In the mean time, a commission passed the great seal, for
taking a precognition of the massacre, as a previous step
to the tryal of the persons concerned in that perfidious
transaction. On the ninth of May, the session was opened
by the Marquis of Tweedale, appointed commissioner,
who, after the King's letter had been read, expatiated on
his Majesty's care and concern for their safety and wel∣fare;
and his firm purpose to maintain the presbyterian
discipline in the church of Scotland. Then he promised,
in the King's name, that if they would pass an act for
establishing a colony in Africa, America, or any other part
of the world where a colony might be lawfully planted,
his Majesty would indulge them with such rights and
privileges as he had granted in like cases to the subjects of
his other dominions. Finally, he exhorted them to con∣sider
ways and means to raise the necessary supplies for
maintaining their land forces, and for providing a compe∣tent
number of ships of war to protect their commerce.
The parliament immediately voted an address of condo∣lance
to his Majesty on the death of the Queen; and
they granted one hundred and twenty thousand pounds
sterling for the services of the ensuing year, to be raised
by a general poll-tax, a land-tax, and an additional
excise.</P>
<P>§ VIII. Their next step was to desire the commissioner
would transmit their humble thanks to the King, for his
care to vindicate the honour of the government and the
justice of the nation, in ordering a precognition to be
taken with respect to the slaughter of Glencoe. A motion
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
was afterwards made, that the commissioners should ex∣hibit
an account of their proceedings in this affair: ac∣cordingly,
a report, consisting of the King's instructions,
Dalrymple's letters, the depositions of witnesses, and the
opinion of the committee, was laid before the parliament.
The motion is said to have been privately influenced by
Secretary Johnston, for the disgrace of Dalrymple, who
was his rival in power and interest. The written opinion
of the commissioners, who were creatures of the court,
imported, That Macdonald of Glencoe had been perfi∣diously
murthered; that the King's intentions contained
nothing to warrant the massacre; and that Secretary Dal∣rymple
had exceeded his orders. The parliament con∣curred
with this report. They resolved, That Livingston
was not to blame, for having given the orders contained
in his letters to Lieut. Col. Hamilton: that this last was
liable to prosecution: that the King should be addressed
to give orders, either for examining Major Duncanson in
Flanders, touching his concern in this affair, or for send∣ing
him home to be tried in Scotland; as also, that Camp∣bel
of Glenlyon, Captain Drummond, Lieutenant Lind∣sey,
Ensign Lundy, and Serjeant Barber, should be sent
to Scotland, and prosecuted according to law, for the parts
they had acted in that execution. In consequence of
these resolutions, the parliament drew up an address to
the King, in which they laid the whole blame of the massa∣cre
upon the excess in the Master of Stair's letters con∣cerning
that transaction. They begged that his Majesty
would give such orders about him, as he should think sit
for the vindication of his government; that the actors in
that barbarous slaughter might be prosecuted by the King's
advocate, according to law; and that some reparation
might be made to the men of Glencoe who escaped the
massacre, for the losses they had sustained in their effects
upon that occasion, as their habitations had been plundered
and burned, their lands wasted, and their cattle driven
away; so that they were reduced to extreme poverty.
Notwithstanding this address of the Scottish parliament, by
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
which the King was so solemnly exculpated, his memory
is still loaded with the suspicion of having concerted, coun∣tenanced,
and enforced this barbarous execution, especially
as the Master of Stair escaped with impunity, and the
other actors of the tragedy, far from being punished, were
preferred in the service. While the commissioners were
employed in the enquiry, they made such discoveries con∣cerning
the conduct of the Earl of Breadalbane, as
amounted to a charge of high-treason; and he was com∣mitted
prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh: but it seems
he had dissembled with the Highlanders, by the King's
permission, and now sheltered himself under the shadow of
a royal pardon.</P>
<P>§ IX. The committee of trade, in pursuance of the
powers granted by the King to his commissioner, prepared
an act for establishing a company trading to Africa and
the Indies, empowering them to plant colonies, hold cities,
towns, or forts, in places uninhabited, or in others, with
the consent of the natives; vesting them with an exclusive
right, and an exemption for one-and-twenty years from all
duties or impositions. This act was likewise confirmed
by letters-patent under the great seal, directed by the par∣liament,
without any further warrant from the crown.
Paterson, the projector, had contrived the scheme of a
settlement upon the Isthmus of Darien, in such a manner
as to carry on a trade in the South-Sea, as well as in the
Atlantick; nay, even to extend it as far as the East-Indies:
a great number of London merchants, allured
by the prospect of gain, were eager to engage in such a
company, exempted from all manner of imposition and re∣striction.
The Scottish parliament likewise passed an act
in favour of the episcopal clergy, decreeing, That those
who should enter into such engagements to the King, as
were by law required, might continue in their benefices
under his Majesty's protection, without being subject to
the power of presbytery. Seventy of the most noted
ministers of that persuasion took the benefit of this indul∣gence.
Another law was enacted, for raising nine thousand
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
men yearly, to recruit the Scottish regiments abroad; and
an act for erecting a publick bank: then the parliament
was adjourned to the seventh day of November.</P>
<P>§ X. Ireland began to be infected with the same factions
which had broke out in England since the Revolution.
Lord Capel, the lord-deputy, governed in a very partial
manner, oppressing the Irish papists, without any re∣gard
to equity or decorum. He undertook to model a
parliament in such a manner, that they should comply
with all the demands of the ministry; and he succeeded in
his endeavours, by making such arbitrary changes in offices
as best suited his purpose. These precautions being taken,
he convoked a parliament for the twenty-seventh day of
August, when he opened the session with a speech, expa∣tiating
upon their obligations to King William, and ex∣horting
them to make suitable returns to such a gracious
sovereign. He observed, that the revenue had sallen short
of the establishment; so that both the civil and military
lists were greatly in debt: that his Majesty had sent over
a bill for an additional excise, and expected they would
find ways and means to answer the demands of the service.
They forthwith voted an address of thanks, and resolved
to assist his Majesty to the utmost of their power, against
all his enemies foreign and domestick. They passed the
bill for an additional excise, together with an act for laking
away the writs “<HI>De heretico comburendo;</HI>” another an∣nulling
all attainders and acts passed in the late pretended
parliament of King James: a third to prevent foreign
education: a fourth for disarming papists: and a fifth for
settling the estates of intestates. Then they resolved,
That a sum not exceeding one hundred and sixty-three
thousand, three hundred and twenty-five pounds, should
be granted to his Majesty, to be raised by a poll-bill, ad∣ditional
customs, and a continuation of the additional ex∣cise.
Sir Charles Porter, the Chancellor, finding his im∣portance
diminished, if not entirely destroyed, by the
assuming disposition and power of the Lord-Deputy, began
to court popularity, by espousing the cause of the Irish,
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
against the severity of the administration; and actually
formed a kind of Tory-interest, which thwarted Lord
Capel in all his measures. A motion was made in parlia∣ment
to impeach the Chancellor, for sowing discord and
division among his Majesty's subjects: but, being in∣dulged
with a hearing by the House of Commons, he
justified himself so much to their satisfaction, that he was
voted clear of all imputation, by a great majority. Never∣theless,
they, at the end of the session, sent over an ad∣dress,
in which they bore testimony to the mild and just
administration of their Lord Deputy.</P>
<P>§ XI. King William having taken such steps as were
deemed necessary for preserving the peace of England in
his absence, crossed the sea to Holland in the middle of
May, fully determined to make some great effort in the
Netherlands, that might aggrandise his military character,
and humble the power of France, which was already in
the decline. That kingdom was actually exhausted in
such a manner, that the haughty Louis found himself
obliged to stand upon the defensive against enemies over
whom he had been used to triumph with uninterrupted
success. He heard the clamours of his people, which he
could not quiet: he saw his advances to peace rejected;
and to crown his misfortunes, he sustained an irreparable
loss in the death of Francis de Montmorency, Duke of
Luxembourg, to whose military talents he owed the great∣est
part of his glory and success. That great officer died in
January at Versailles, in the sixty-seventh year of his age;
and Louis lamented his death the more deeply, as he had
not another general left, in whose understanding he could
conside. The conduct of the army in Flanders was en∣trusted
to Mareschal Villeroy; and Boufflers commanded
a separate army, though subject to the other's orders. As
the French King took it for granted, that the confederates
would have a superiority of numbers in the field, and was
well acquainted with the enterprising genius of their chief,
he ordered a new line to be drawn between the Lys and
the Scheld: he caused a disposition to be made for covering
<PB N="234" REF="238"/>
Dunkirk, Ypres, Tournay, and Namur; and laid in∣junctions
on his general to act solely on the defensive.
Mean while, the confederates formed two armies in the
Netherlands. The first consisted of seventy battalions of
infantry, and eighty-two squadrons of horse and dragoons,
chiefly English and Scots, encamped at Aerseele, Ca∣neghem,
and Wouterghem, between Thield and Deynse,
to be commanded by the King in person, assisted by the
old Prince of Vaudemont. The other army, composed
of sixteen battalions of foot, and one hundred and thirty
squadrons of horse, encamped at Zellich and Hamme, on
the road from Brussels to Dendermonde, under the com∣mand
of the Elector of Bavaria, seconded by the Duke of
Holstein-Ploen. Major-General Ellemberg was posted
near Dixmuyde with twenty battalions and ten squadrons;
and another body of Brandenburgh and Dutch troops,
with a re-enforcement from Liege, lay encamped on the
Mehaigne, under the conduct of the Baron de Heyden,
lieutenant-general of Brandenburgh, and the Count de
Berlo, general of the Liege cavalry. King William ar∣rived
in the camp on the fifth day of July; and remained
eight days at Aerseele. Then he marched to Bekelar,
while Villeroy retired behind his lines between Menin and
Ypres, after having detached ten thousand men to re-en∣force
Boufflers, who had advanced to Pont d'Espieres:
but he too retreating within his lines, the Elector of Ba∣varia
passed the Scheld, and took post at Kirkhoven: at
the same time the body under Heyden advanced towards
Namur.</P>
<P>§ XII. The King of England, having by his motions
drawn the forces of the enemy on the side of Flanders,
directed the Baron de Heyden and the Earl of Athlone,
who commanded forty squadrons from the camp of the
Elector of Bavaria, to invest Namur; and this service was
performed on the third day of July: but, as the place was
not entirely surrounded, Mareschal Bousslers threw him∣self
into it, with such a re-enforcement of dragoons as
augmented the garrison to the number of fifteen thousand
<PB N="235" REF="239"/>
cho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en men. King William and the Elector brought up
the rest of the forces, which encamped on both sides of
the Sambre and the Maese; and the lines of circumvalla∣tion
were begun on the sixth day of July, under the di∣rection
of the celebrated engineer, General Coehorn. The
place was formerly very strong, both by situation and art;
but the French, since its last reduction, had made such
additional works, that both the town and citadel seemed
impregnable. Considering the number of the garrison,
and the quality of the troops, commanded by a mareschal
of France, distinguished by his valour and conduct, the
enterprise was deemed an undeniable proof of William's
temerity. On the eleventh the trenches were opened, and
next day the batteries began to play with incredible fury.
The King receiving intelligence of a motion made by a
body of French troops, with a view to intercept the con∣voys,
detached twenty squadrons of horse and dragoons
to observe the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Prince Vaudemont, who was left at Roselaer
with fifty battalions, and the like number of squadrons,
understanding that Villeroy had passed the Lys, in order
to attack him, took post with his left near Grammen, his
right by Aerseele and Caneghem, and began to fortify his
camp, with a view to expect the enemy. Their vanguard
appearing on the evening of the thirteenth at Dentreghem,
he changed the disposition of his camp, and entrenched
himself on both sides. Next day, however, perceiving
Villeroy's design was to surround him, by means of ano∣ther
body of troops commanded by M. Montal, who had
already passed the Thieldt for that purpose, he resolved to
avoid an engagement, and effected a retreat to Ghent,
which is celebrated as one of the most capital efforts of
military conduct. He forthwith detached twelve batta∣lions
and twelve pieces of cannon, to secure Newport,
which Villeroy had intended to invest: but that general
now changed his resolution, and undertook the siege of
Dixmuyde, garrisoned by eight battalions of foot, and a
regiment of dragoons, commanded by Major-General
<PB N="236" REF="240"/>
Ellemberg, who, in six and thirty hours after the trenches
were opened, surrendered himself and his soldiers pri∣soners
of war. This scandalous example was followed by
Colonel Ofarrel, who yielded up Deynse on the same
shameful conditions, even before a battery was opened by
the besiegers. In the sequel they were both tried for their
misbehaviour: Ellemberg suffered death, and Osarrel
was broke with infamy. The Prince of Vaudemont sent
a message to the French general, demanding the garrisons
of those two places, according to a cartel which had
been settled between the powers at war; but no regard
was paid to this remonstrance. Villeroy, after several
marches and countermarches, appeared before Brussels, on
the thirteenth day of August, and sent a letter to the
Prince of Berghem, governor of that city, importing,
that the King his master had ordered him to bombard
the town, by way of making reprisals for the damage done
by the English <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet to the maritime towns of France: he
likewised desired to know in what part the Electress of
Bavaria resided, that he might not sire into that quarter.
After this declaration, which was no more than an un∣meaning
compliment, he began to bombard and cannonade
the place with red hot bullets, which produced conflagra∣tions
in many different parts of the city, and frightened
the Electress into a miscarriage. On the fifteenth, the
French discontinued their firing, and retired to Enghein.</P>
<P>§ XIV. During these transactions, the siege of Namur
was prosecuted with great ardour, under the eye of the
King of England; while the garrison defended the place
with equal spirit and perseverance. On the eighteenth day
of July, Major-General Ramsay and Lord Cutts, at the
head of five battalions, English, Scots, and Dutch, at∣tacked
the enemy's advanced works, on the right of the
counterscarp. They were sustained by six English bat∣talions,
commanded by Brigadier-General Fitzpatrick;
while eight foreign regiments, with nine thousand pio∣neers,
advanced on the lest, under Major-General Salisch.
The assault was desperate and bloody, the enemy main∣taining
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
their ground for two hours with undaunted cou∣rage:
but at last, they were obliged to give way, and
were pursued to the very gates of the town, though not
before they had killed or wounded twelve hundred men
of the confederate army. The King was so well pleased
with the behaviour of the British troops, that during the
action he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the Elector
of Bavaria, and exclaimed with emotion, “See my brave
English!” On the twenty-seventh, the English and
Scots, under Ramsay and Hamilton, assaulted the coun∣terscarp,
where they met with prodigious opposition from
the fire of the besieged. Nevertheless, being sustained by
the Dutch, they made a lodgment on the foremost co∣vered
way before the gates of St. Nicholas, as also upon
part of the counterguard. The valour of the assailants
on this occasion was altogether unprecedented, and almost
incredible, while, on the other hand, the courage of the
besieged was worthy of praise and admiration. Several
persons were killed in the trenches at the side of the King,
and among these Mr. Godfrey, deputy-governor of the
Bank of England, who had come to the camp, to confer
with his Majesty about remitting money for the payment
of the army. On the thirtieth day of July the Elector
of Bavaria attacked Vauban's line that surrounded the
works of the castle. General Coehorn was present in this
action, which was performed with equal valour and suc∣cess.
They not only broke through the line, but even
took possession of Coehorn's fort, in which, however,
they found it impossible to effect a lodgment. On the se∣cond
day of August, Lord Cutts, with four hundred
English, and Dutch grenadiers, attacked the saillant∣angle
of a demi-bastion, and lodged himself on the second
counterscarp. The breaches being now practicable, and
preparations made for a general assault, Count Guiscard,
the governor, capitulated for the town on the fourth of
August; and the French retired into the citadel, against
which twelve batteries played, upon the thirteenth. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renches, meanwhile, were carried on with great expe∣dition,
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
notwithstanding all the efforts of the besieged,
who fired without ceasing, and exerted amazing diligence
and intrepidity in defending and repairing the damage
they sustained. At length, the annoyance became so dread∣ful
from the unintermitting showers of bombs and red
hot bullets, that Boufflers, after having made divers fu∣rious
sallies, formed a scheme for breaking through the
confederate camp with his cavalry. This, however, was pre∣vented
by the extreme vigilance of King William.</P>
<P>§ XV. After the bombardment of Brussels, Villeroy be∣ing
re-enforced with all the troops that could be drafted
from garrisons, advanced towards Namur, with an army
of ninety thousand men: and Prince Vaudemont being
joined by the Prince of Hesse, with a strong body of for∣ces
from the Rhine, took possession of the strong camp
at Masy, within five English miles of the besieging army.
The King, understanding that the enemy had reached
Fleurus, where they discharged ninety pieces of cannon,
as a signal to inform the garrison of their approach, left
the conduct of the siege to the Elector of Bavaria, and
took upon himself the command of the covering-army,
in order to oppose Villeroy, who being further re-enforced
by a detachment from Germany, declared, that he would
hazard a battle for the relief of Namur. But, when he
viewed the posture of the allies near Masy, he changed
his resolution, and retired in the night without noise. On
the thirtieth day of August, the besieged were summoned
to surrender, by Count Horn, who, in a parley with the
Count de Lamont, general of the French infantry, gave
him to understand, that Mareschal Villeroy had retired
towards the Mehaigne; so that the garrison could not ex∣pect
to be relieved. No immediate answer being returned
to this message, the parley was broke off, and the King
resolved to proceed without delay to a general assault,
which he had already planned with the Elector and his
other generals. Between one and two in the afternoon,
Lord Cutts, who desired the command, though it was
not his turn of duty, rushed out of the trenches of the
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>
second line, at the head of three hundred grenadiers, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake a lodgment in the breach of Terra-nova, supported
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the regiments of Coulthorp, Buchan, Hamilton, and
Mackay; while Colonel Marselly, with a body of Dutch,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Bavarians, and Brandenburghers, attacked at two
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther places. The assailants met with such a warm recep∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,
that the English grenadiers were repulsed, even af∣ter
they had mounted the breach, Lord Cutts being for
some time disabled by a shot in the head. Marselly was
defeated, taken, and afterwards killed by a cannon-ball
from the batteries of the besiegers. The Bavarians, by mis∣taking
their way, were exposed to a terrible fire, by which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir general, Count Rivera, and a great number of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir officers were slain: nevertheless, they fixed them∣selves
on the outward entrenchment, on the point of the
Coehorn next to the Sambre, and maintained their ground
with amazing fortitude. Lord Cutts, when his wound
was dressed, returned to the scene of action, and ordered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo hundred chosen men of Mackay's regiment, com∣manded
by Lieutenant Cockle, to attack the face of the
saillant-angle next to the breach, sword in hand, while
the ensigns of the same regiment should advance, and plant
their colours on the pallisadoes. Cockle and his detach∣ment
executed the command he had received with admi∣rable
intrepidity. They broke through the pallisadoes,
drove the French from the covered-way, made a lodg∣ment
in one of the batteries, and turned the cannon
against the enemy. The Bavarians being thus sustained,
made their post good. The Major-generals La Cave and
Schwerin lodged themselves at the same time on the co∣vered
way; and though the general assault did not succeed
in its full extent, the confederates remained masters of
a very considerable lodgment, nearly an English mile in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength. Yet this was dearly purchased with the lives of
two thousand men, including many officers of great rank
and reputation. During the action the Elector of Bavaria
signalized his courage in a very remarkable manner, riding
from place to place through the hottest of the fire, giving
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
his directions with notable presence of mind, according
to the emergency of circumstances, animating the officers
with praise and promise of preferment, and distributing
handfuls of gold among the private soldiers.</P>
<P>§ XVI. On the first day of September, the besieged
having obtained a cessation of arms, that their dead might
be buried, the Count de Guiscard appearing on the breach
desired to speak with the Elector of Bavaria. His High∣ness
immediately mounting the breach, the French go∣vernor
offered to surrender the fort of Coehorn; but was
given to understand, that if he intended to capitulate, he
must treat for the whole. This reply being communicated
to Boufflers, he agreed to the proposal: the cessation was
prolonged, and that very evening the capitulation was
finished. Villeroy, who lay encamped at Gemblours,
was no sooner apprised of this event, by a triple discharge
of all the artillery, and a running fire along the lines of
the confederate army, than he passed the Sambre near
Charleroy, with great precipitation; and having re-en∣forced
the garrison of Dinant, retreated towards the lines
iu the neighbourhood of Mons. On the fifth day of Sep∣tember,
the French garrison, which was now reduced
from fifteen to five thousand five hundred men, evacua∣ated
the city of Namur. Boufflers, in marching out, was
arrested in the name of his Britannick Majesty, by way
of reprisal for the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse,
which the French King had detained, contrary to the
cartel subsisting between the two nations. The Mareschal
was not a little discomposed at this unexpected incident,
and expostulated warmly with Mr. Dyckvelt, who assured
him the King of Great Britain entertained a profound
respect for his person and character. William even offered
to set him at liberty, provided he would pass his word,
that the garrison of Dixmuyde and Deynse should be
sent back, or that he himself would return in a fortnight.
He said, that he could not enter into any such engagement,
as he did not know his master's reasons for detaining the
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>
garrisons in question. He was, therefore, re-conveyed to
Namur; from thence removed to Maestricht, and treated
with great reverence and respect, till the return of an offi∣cer
whom he had dispatched to Versailles with an ac∣count
of his captivity. Then he engaged his word, that
the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse should be sent
back to the allied army. He was immediately released,
and conducted in safety to Dinant. When he repaired to
Versailles, Louis received him with very extraordinary
marks of esteem and affection. He embraced him in pub∣lick
with the warmest expressions of regard; declared
himself perfectly well satisfied with his conduct; created
him a Duke and peer of France; and presented him with
a very large sum, in acknowledgement of his signal ser∣vices.</P>
<P>§ XVII. After the reduction of Namur, which greatly
enhanced the military character of King William, he re∣tired
to his house at Loo, which was his favourite place
of residence, leaving the command to the Elector of Ba∣varia;
and about the latter end of September both armies
began to separate. The French forces retired within their
lines. A good number of the allied troops were distributed
in different garrisons; and a strong detachment marched
towards Newport, under the command of the Prince of
Wirtemberg, for the security of that place. Thus ended
the campaign in the Netherlands. On the Rhine, nothing
of moment was attempted by either army. The Mareschal
de Lorges, in the beginning of June, passed the Rhine at
Philipsburgh; and posting himself at Brucksal, sent out
parties to ravage the country. On the eleventh of the same
month the Prince of Baden joined the German army at
Steppach, and on the eighth of July was re-enforced by the
troops of the other German confederates, in the neigh∣bourhood
of Wiselock. On the nineteenth, the French
retired without noise, in the night, towards Manheim,
where they repassed the river, without any interruption
from the Imperial General; then he sent off a large de∣tachment
to Flanders. The same step was taken by the
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>
Prince of Baden; and each army lay inactive in their
quarters for the remaining part of the campaign. The
command of the Germans in Hungary was conferred upon
the Elector of Saxony: but the court of Vienna was so
dilatory in their preparations, that he was not in a con∣dition
to act till the middle of August. Lord Paget had
been sent ambassador from England to the Ottoman
Porte, with instructions relating to a pacification: but,
before he could obtain an audience, the Sultan died, and
was succeeded by his nephew, Mustapha, who resolved to
prosecute the war in person. The warlike genius of this
new emperor afforded but an uncomfortable prospect to
his people, considering that Peter, the Czar of Muscovy,
had taken the opportunity of the War in Hungary, to in∣vade
the Crimea, and besiege Azoph: so that the Tar∣tars
were too much employed at home to spare the suc∣cours
which the Sultan demanded. Nevertheless, Musta∣pha
and his visir took the field before the Imperialists could
commence the operations of the campaign, passed the
Danube, took Lippa and Titul by assault, stormed the
camp of General Veterani, who was posted at Lugos with
seven thousand men, and who lost his life in the action.
The infantry were cut to pieces, after having made a des∣perate
defence: but the horse retreated to Carousebes,
under the conduct of General Trusches. The Turks, after
this exploit, retired to Orsowa. Their navy, meanwhile,
surprised the Venetian fleet at Scio, where several ships
of the republick were destroyed, and they recovered
that island, which the Venetians thought proper to aban∣don:
but, in order to balance this misfortune, these last
obtained a complete victory over the Bashaw of Negropont
in the Morea.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The French King still maintained a secret
negociation with the Duke of Savoy, whose conduct had
been for some time mysterious and equivocal. Contrary
to the opinion of his allies, he undertook the siege of Casal,
which was counted one of the strongest fortifications in
Europe, defended by a numerous garrison, abundantly
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>
supplied with ammunition and provision. The siege was
begun about the middle of May; and the place was sur∣rendered
by capitulation in about fourteen days, to the
astonishment of the confederates, who did not know that
this was a sacrifice by which the French court obtained
the Duke's forbearance during the remaining part of the
campaign. The capitulation imported, That the place
should be restored to the Duke of Mantua, who was the
rightful proprietor: That the fortifications should be de∣molished
at the expense of the allies: that the garrison
should remain in the fort till that work should be com∣pleted:
and hostages were exchanged for the performance
of these conditions. The Duke understood the art of
procrastination so well, that September was far advanced
before the place was wholly dismantled; and then he was
seised with an ague, which obliged him to quit the army.</P>
<P>§ XIX. In Catalonia the French could hardly maintain
the footing they had gained. Admiral Russel, who win∣tered
at Cadix, was created admiral, chief commander,
and captain-general of all his Majesty's ships employed,
or to be employed in the Narrow-Seas, and in the Medi∣terranean.
He was re-enforced by four thousand five hun∣dred
soldiers, under the command of Brigadier-General
Stewart; and seven thousand men, Imperialists as well as
Spaniards, were drafted from Italy, for the defence of
Catalonia. These forces were transported to Barcelona,
under the convoy of Admiral Nevil, detached by Russel
for that purpose. The affairs of Catalonia had already
changed their aspect. Several French parties had been de∣feated.
The Spaniards had blocked up Ostalric and Castel-Follit:
Noailles had been recalled, and the command de∣volved
to the Duke de Vendome, who no sooner under∣stood
that the forces from Italy were landed, than he dis∣mantled
Ostalric and Castel-Follit, and retired to Palamos.
The viceroy of Catalonia, and the English Admiral hav∣ing
resolved to give battle to the enemy, and reduce Pa∣lamos,
the English troops were landed on the ninth day
of August, and the allied army advanced to Palamos.
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>
The French appeared in order of battle: but the viceroy
declined an engagement. Far from attacking the enemy,
he withdrew his forces, and the town was bombarded by
the admiral. The miscarriage of this expedition was in a
great measure owing to a misunderstanding between Russel
and the court of Spain. The Admiral complained that his
Catholic Majesty had made no preparations for the cam∣paign;
that he had neglected to fulfil his engagements
with respect to the Spanish squadron, which ought to have
joined the fleets of England and Holland: that he had
taken no care to provide tents and provision for the Bri∣tish
forces. On the the twenty-seventh day of August he
failed for the coast of Provence, where his fleet was en∣dangered
by a terrible tempest; then he steered down
the Straits, and towards the latter end of September ar∣rived
in the bay of Cadix. There he left a number of ships
under the command of Sir David Mitchel, until he
should be joined by Sir George Rooke, who was expected
from England, and returned home with the rest of the
combined squadrons.</P>
<P>§ XX. While Admiral Russel asserted the British do∣minion
in the Mediterranean, the French coasts were again
insulted in the channel by a separate fleet, under the com∣mand
of Lord Berkeley of Stratton, assisted by the Dutch
Admiral Allemonde. On the fourth day of July they an∣chored
before St. Maloes, which they bombarded from
nine ketches covered by some frigates, which sustained
more damage than was done to the enemy. On the sixth
Granville underwent the same fate; and then the sleet
returned to Portsmouth. The bomb-vessels being refitted,
the sleet sailed round to the Downs, where four hundred
soldiers were embarked for an attempt upon Dunkirk,
under the direction of Meesters, the famous Dutch engi∣gineer,
who had prepared his infernals, and other machines
for the service. On the first day of August the experi∣ment
was tried without success. The bombs did some ex∣ecution:
but two smoak ships miscarried. The French
had secured the Risbank and wooden forts, with piles,
bombs, chains, and sloating batteries, in such a manner,
<PB N="245" REF="249"/>
that the machine-vessels could not approach near enough
to produce any effect. Besides, the councils of the assail∣ants
were distracted by violent animosities. The English
officers hated Meesters, because he was a Dutchman, and
had acquired some credit with the King: he, on the other
hand, treated them with disrespect. He retired with his
machines in the night, and refused to co-operate with
Lord Berkeley in his design upon Calais, which was now
put in execution. On the sixteenth he brought his batte∣ries
to bear upon this place, and set fire to it in different
quarters: but the enemy had taken such precautions as
rendered his scheme abortive.</P>
<P>§ XXI. A squadron had been sent to the West Indies
under the joint-command of Captain Robert Wilmot
and Colonel Lilingston, with twelve hundred land-forces.
They had instructions to co-operate with the Spaniards
in Hispaniola, against the French settlements on that is∣land,
and to destroy their fisheries on the banks of New∣foundland,
in their return. They were accordingly joined
by seventeen hundred Spaniards raised by the president
of St. Domingo: but, instead of proceeding against Petit-Guavas,
according to the directions they had received,
Wilmot took possession of Fort Francois, and plundered
the country for his own private advantage, notwithstand∣ing
the remonstrances of Lilingston, who protested a∣gainst
his conduct. In a word, the sea and land officers
lived in a state of perpetual dissention; and both became
extremely disagreeable to the Spaniards, who soon re∣nounced
all connexion with them and their designs. In
the beginning of September the Commodore set sail for
England, and lost one of his ships in the gulph of Florida.
He himself died in the passage; and the greater part of
the men being swept off by an epidemical distemper, the
squadron returned to Britain in a most miserable condi∣tion.
Notwithstanding the great efforts the nation had
made to maintain such a number of different squadrons
for the protection of commerce, as well as to annoy the
enemy, the trade suffered severely from the French priva∣teers,
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>
which swarmed in both channels, and made prize of
many rich vessels. The Marquis of Caermarthen, being
stationed with a squadron off the Scilly islands, mistook
a fleet of merchant ships for the Brest fleet, and retired
with precipation to Milford-Haven. In consequenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
this retreat, the privateers took a good number of ships
from Barbardoes, and five from the East-Indies, valued
at a million sterling. The merchants renewed their cla∣mour
against the commissioners of the Admiralty, who
produced their orders and instructions in their own de∣fence.
The Marquis of Caermarthen had been guilty of
flagrant misconduct on this occasion: but, the chief source
of those national calamities was the circumstantial intelli∣gence
transmitted to France from time to time, by the
malcontents of England; for they were actuated by a scan∣dalous
principle, which they still retain, namely, that of
rejoicing in the distress of their country.</P>
<P>§ XXII. King William, after having conferred with the
States of Holland, and the Elector of Brandenburgh, who
met him at the Hague, embarked for England on the
nineteenth day of October, and arrived in safety at Mar∣gate,
from whence he proceeded to London, where he
was received as a conqueror, amidst the rejoicings and
acclamations of the people. On the same day he summoned
a council at Kensington, in which it was determined to
convoke a new parliament. While the nation was in good
humour, it was supposed that they would return such
members only as were well affected to the government;
whereas, the present parliament might proceed in its
enquiries into corruption and other grievances, and be
the less influenced by the crown, as their dependence
was of such short duration. The parliament was, there∣fore,
dissolved by proclamation, and a new one sum∣moned
to meet at Westminster on the twenty-second day
of November. While the whole nation was occupied in
the elections, William, by the advice of his chief confi∣dants,
laid his own disposition under restraint, in another
effort to acquire popularity. He honoured the diversions
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>
of Newmarket with his presence, and there received a
compliment of congratulation from the university of Cam∣bridge.
Then he visited the Earls of Sunderland, Nor∣thampton,
and Montague, at their different houses in the
country; and proceeded with a splendid retinue to Lin∣coln,
from whence he repaired to Welbeck, a seat belong∣ing
to the Duke of Newcastle in Nottinghamshire, where
he was attended by Dr. Sharp, Archbishop of York, and
his clergy. He lodged one night with Lord Brooke, at
Warwick-castle, dined with the Duke of Shrewsbury at
Eyefort, and, by the way of Woodstock, made a solemn
entry into Oxford, having been met at some distance from
the city by the Duke of Ormond, as Chancellor of the
University, the Vice-Chancellor, the doctors in their
habits, and the magistrates in their formalities. He pro∣ceeded
directly to the theatre, where he was welcomed in
an elegant Latin speech: he received from the Chancellor
on his knees, the usual presents of a large English Bible,
and book of Common-Prayer, the cuts of the university,
and a pair of gold-fringe gloves. The conduits ran with
wine, and a magnificent banquet was prepared: but, an
anonymous letter being found in the street, importing,
that there was a design to poison his Majesty, William re∣fused
to eat or drink in Oxford, and retired immediately
to Windsor. Notwithstanding this abrupt departure,
which did not savour much of magnanimity, the university
chose Sir William Trumbal, Secretary of State, as one of
their representatives in parliament.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The Whig-interest generally prevailed in the
elections, though many even of that party were malcon∣tents;
and when the parliament met, Foley was again
chosen Speaker of the Commons. The King, in his first
speech, extolled the valour of the English forces; expressed
his concern at being obliged to demand such large supplies
from his people; observed, that the funds had proved very
deficient, and the civil list was in a precarious condition;
recommended to their compassion the miserable situation
of the French protestants: took notice of the bad state of
<PB N="248" REF="252"/>
the coin; desired they would form a good bill for the en∣couragement
and increase of seamen; and contrive laws
for the advancement of commerce. He mentioned the
great preparations which the French were making for
taking the field early; intreated them to use dispatch;
expressed his satisfaction at the choice which his people
had made of their representatives in the House of Com∣mons;
and exhorted them to proceed with temper and
unanimity. Though the two Houses presented addresses
of congratulation to the King, upon his late success, and
promised to assist him in prosecuting the war with vigour,
the nation loudly exclaimed against the intolerable bur∣thens
and losses to which they were subjected, by a foreign
scheme of politicks, which, like an unfathomable abyss,
swallowed up the wealth and blood of the kingdom. All
the King's endeavours to cover the disgusting side of his
character had proved ineffectual: he was still dry, re∣served,
and forbidding; and the malcontents inveighed
bitterly against his behaviour to the Princess Anne of Den∣mark.
When the news of Namur's being reduced arrived
in England, this lady congratulated him upon his success
in a dutiful letter, to which he would not deign to send a
reply, either by writing or message; nor had she or her
husband been favoured with the slightest mark of regard
since his return to England. The members in the Lower-House,
who had adopted opposing maxims, either from
principle or resentment, resolved, That the crown should
purchase the supplies with some concession in favour of
the people. They, therefore, brought in the so long con∣tested
bill for regulating tryals in cases of high-treason,
and misprision of treason; and, considering the critical
juncture of affairs, the courtiers were afraid of obstructing
such a popular measure. The Lords inserted a clause,
enacting, That a peer should be tried by the whole
peerage; and the Commons at once assented to this
amendment. The bill provided, That persons indicted
for high-treason, or misprision of treason, should be fur∣nished
with a copy of the indictment, five days before the
<PB N="249" REF="253"/>
tryal; and indulged with counsel to plead in their de∣fence:
That no person should be indicted but upon the
oaths of two lawful witnesses swearing to overt-acts:
That in two or more distinct treasons of divers kinds,
alledged in one bill of indictment, one witness to one,
and another witness to another, should not be deemed two
witnesses: That no person should be prosecuted for any
such crime, unless the indictment be found within three
years after the offence committed, except in case of a de∣sign
or attempt to assassinate or poison the King, where
this limitation should not take place: That persons in∣dicted
for treason, or misprision of treason, should be sup∣plied
with copies of the pannel of the jurors, two days at
least before the tryal, and have process to compel their wit∣nesses
to appear: That no evidence should be admitted of
any overt-act not expresly laid in the indictment: That
this act should not extend to any impeachment, or other
proceedings in parliament; nor to any indictment for
counterfeiting his Majesty's coin, his great-seal, privy-seal,
sign-manual, or signet.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. This important affair being discussed, the
Commons proceeded to examine the accompts and estimates,
and voted above five millions for the service of the ensuing
year. The state of the coin was by this time become such
a national grievance as could not escape the attention of
parliament. The Lords prepared an address to the throne,
for a proclamation to put a stop to the currency of dimi∣nished
coin; and to this they desired the concurrence of
the Commons. The Lower-House, however, determined
to take this affair under their own inspection. They ap∣pointed
a committee of the whole House, to deliberate on
the state of the nation with respect to the currency. Great
opposition was made to a recoinage, which was a measure
strenuously recommended and supported by Mr. Monta∣gue,
who acted on this occasion by the advice of the great
mathematician Sir Isaac Newton. The enemies of this
expedient argued, that should the silver coin be called in,
it would be impossible to maintain the war abroad, or pro∣secute
<PB N="250" REF="254"/>
foreign trade, inasmuch as the merchant could not
pay his bills of exchange, nor the soldier receive his sub∣sistence:
that a stop would be put to all mutual payment;
and this would produce universal confusion and despair.
Such a reformation could not be effected without some
danger and difficulty; but it was become absolutely neces∣sary,
as the evil daily increased, and in a little time must
have terminated in national anarchy. After long and ve∣hement
debates, the majority resolved to proceed with all
possible expedition to a new coinage. Another question
arose, Whether the new coin, in its different denomi∣nations,
should retain the original weight and purity of
the old; or the established standard be raised in value?
The famous Locke engaged in this dispute against Mr.
Lowndes, who proposed that the standard should be raised:
the arguments of Mr. Locke were so convincing, that the
committee resolved the established standard should be pre∣served
with respect to weight and fineness. They like∣wise
resolved, That the loss accruing to the revenue from
clipped money, should be born'd by the publick. In order
to prevent a total stagnation, they further resolved, That
after an appointed day, no clipped money should pass in
payment, except to the collectors of the revenue and
taxes, or upon loans or payments into the Exchequer:
That, after another day to be appointed, no clipped money
of any sort should pass in any payment whatsoever; and
that a third day should be fixed for all persons to bring in
their clipped money to be recoined, after which they should
have no allowance upon what they might offer. They
addressed the King to issue a proclamation agreeably to
these resolutions; and, on the nineteenth day of Decem∣ber,
it was published accordingly. Such were the fears
of the people, augmented and inflamed by the enemies of
the government, that all payment immediately ceased,
and a face of distraction appeared through the whole com∣munity.
The adversaries of the bill seised this opportunity
to aggravate the apprehensions of the publick. They
inveighed against the ministry, as the authors of this
<PB N="251" REF="255"/>
national grievance: they levelled their satire particularly
at Montague; and it required uncommon fortitude and
address to avert the most dangerous consequences of popu∣lar
discontent. The House of Commons agreed to the
following resolutions, that twelve hundred thousand
pounds should be raised by a duty on glass-windows, to
make up the loss on the clipped money: That the recom∣pense
for supplying the deficiency of clipped money should
extend to all silver coin, though of a coarser alloy than
the standard: That the collectors and receivers of his
Majesty's aids and revenues should be enjoined to receive
all such monies: That a reward of five per cent. should
be given to all such persons as should bring in either
milled or broad unclipped money, to be applied in ex∣change
of the clipped money throughout the kingdom;
That a reward of three pence per ounce should be given
to all persons who should bring in wrought plate to the
mint to be coined: That persons might pay in their whole
next year's land-tax in clipped money, at one convenient
time to be appointed for that purpose: That commissioners
should be appointed in every country, to pay and distribute
the milled and broad unclipped money, and the new coined
money in lieu of that which was diminished. A bill being
prepared agreeably to these determinations, was sent up to
the House of Lords, who made some amendments, which
the Commons rejected: but, in order to avoid cavils and
conferences, they dropped the bill, and brought in another
without the clauses which the Lords had inserted. They
were again proposed in the Upper-House, and over-ruled
by the majority; and, on the twenty-first day of January,
the bill received the royal assent, as did another bill, en∣larging
the time for purchasing annuities, and continuing
the duties on low wines. At the same time, the King
passed the bill of tryals for high-treason, and an act to
prevent mercenary elections. Divers merchants and
traders petitioned the House of Commons, that the losses
in their trade and payments, occasioned by the rise of
guineas, might be taken into consideration. A bill was
<PB N="252" REF="256"/>
immediately brought in for taking off the obligation and
encouragement for coining guineas, for a certain time:
and then the Commons proceeded to lower the value of this
coin; a task in which they met with great opposition from
some members, who alledged that it would foment the
popular disturbances. At length, however, the majority
agreed, that a guinea should be lowered from thirty to
eight and twenty shillings, and afterwards to six and
twenty: at length a clause was inserted in the bill for
encouraging people to bring plate to the mint, settling the
price of a guinea at two and twenty shillings, and it na∣turally
sunk to its original value of twenty shillings and
six-pence. Many persons, however, supposing that the
price of gold would be raised in the next session, hoarded
up their guineas; and, upon the same supposition, en∣couraged
by the malcontents, the new coined silver money
was reserved, to the great detriment of commerce. The
King ordered mints to be erected in York, Bristol, Exeter,
and Chester, for the purpose of the recoinage, which was
executed with unexpected success; so that, in less than a
year, the currency of England, which had been the worst,
became the best coin in Europe.</P>
<P>§ XXV. At this period, the attention of the Commons
was diverted to an object of a more private nature. The
Earl of Portland, who enjoyed the greatest share of the
King's favour, had obtained a grant of some lordships in
Derbyshire. While the warrant was depending, the
gentlemen of that county resolved to oppose it with all
their power. In consequence of a petition, they were
indulged with a hearing by the Lords of the Treasury.
Sir William Williams, in the name of the rest, alledged,
that the lordships in question were the ancient demesnes of
the Prince of Wales, absolutely unalienable: that the
revenues of those lordships supported the government of
Wales, in paying the judges and other salaries: that the
grant was of too large an extent for any foreign subject;
and that the people of the county were too great to be
subject to any foreigner. Sundry other substantial reasons
<PB N="253" REF="257"/>
were used against the grant, which, notwithstanding all
their remonstrances, would have passed through the offices,
had not the Welch gentlemen addressed themselves by pe∣tition
to the House of Commons. Upon this occasion,
Mr. Price, a member of the House, harangued with
great severity against the Dutch in general, and did not
even abstain from sarcasms upon the King's person, title,
and government. The objections started by the petition∣ers
being duely considered, were found so reasonable,
that the Commons presented an address to the King, re∣presenting,
That those manours had been usually annexed
to the principality of Wales, and settled on the Princes
of Wales for their support: That many persons in those
parts held their estates by royal tenure, under great and
valuable compositions, rents, royal payments, and ser∣vices
to the crown and Princes of Wales; and enjoyed
great privileges and advantages under such tenure. They,
therefore, besought his Majesty to recal the grant, which
was in diminution of the honour and interest of the crown;
and prayed, that the said manours and lands might not be
alienated without the consent of parliament. This address
met with a cold reception from the King, who promised
to recall the grant which had given such offence to the
Commons; and said he would find some other way of
showing his favour to the Earl of Portland.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The people in general entertained a national
aversion to this nobleman: the malcontents inculcated a
notion that he made use of his interest and intelligence to
injure the trade of England, that the commerce of his
own country might flourish without competition. To his
suggestions they imputed the act and patent in favour of
the Scottish company, which was supposed to have been
thrown in as a bone of contention between the two king∣doms.
The subject was first started in the House of Lords,
who invited the Commons to a conference: a committee
was appointed to examine into the particulars of the act
for erecting the Scottish company; and the two Houses
presented a joint address against it, as a scheme that would
<PB N="254" REF="258"/>
prejudice all the subjects concerned in the wealth and
trade of the English nation. They represented, that, in
consequence of the exemption from taxes, and other ad∣vantages
granted to the Scottish company, that kingdom
would become a free port for all East and West India
commodities: that the Scots would be enabled to supply
all Europe at a cheaper rate than the English could afford
to sell their merchandise for; therefore, England would
lose the benefit of its foreign trade: besides, they ob∣served
that the Scots would smuggle their commodities
into England, to the great detriment of his Majesty and
his customs. To this remonstrance the King replied,
That he had been ill served in Scotland; but that he
hoped some remedies would be found to prevent the incon∣veniencies
of which they were apprehensive. In all pro∣bability
he had been imposed upon by the ministry of that
kingdom; for, in a little time, he discarded the Marquis
of Tweedale, and dismissed both the Scottish secretaries
of states, in lieu of whom he appointed Lord Murray, son
to the Marquis of Athol. Notwithstanding the King's
answer, the committee proceeded on the enquiry, and, in
consequence of the report, confirming a petition from
the East-India Company, the House resolved, That the
directors of the Scottish company were guilty of a high
crime and misdemeanour, in administering and taking an
oath <HI>de fideli</HI> in this kingdom; and that they should be
impeached for the same. Mean while, Roderick Mac∣kenzie,
from whom they had received their chief informa∣tion,
began to retract his evidence, and was ordered into
custody: but he made his escape, and could not be re∣taken,
although the King, at their request, issued a pro∣clamation
for that purpose. The Scots were extremely
incensed against the King, when they understood he had
disowned their company, from which they had promised
themselves such wealth and advantage. The settlement of
Darien was already planned, and afterwards put in exe∣cution;
though it miscarried in the sequel, and had like
to have produced abundance of mischief.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="259"/>
§ XXVII. The complaints of the English merchants
who had suffered by the war were so loud at this juncture,
that the Commons resolved to take their case into consi∣deration.
The House resolved itself into a committee to
consider the state of the nation with regard to commerce,
and having duely weighed all circumstances, agreed to the
following resolutions: That a council of trade should be
established by act of parliament, with powers to take mea∣sures
for the more effectual preservation of commerce:
That the commissioners should be nominated by parlia∣ment,
but none of them have seats in the House: That
they should take an oath, acknowledging the title of King
William as rightful and lawful; and abjuring the pre∣tensions
of James, or any other person. The King con∣sidered
these resolutions as an open attack upon his prero∣gative,
and signified his displeasure to the Earl of Sunder∣land,
who patronised this measure: but it was so popular
in the House, that in all probability it would have been
put in execution, had not the attention of the Commons
been diverted from it at this period by the detection of a
new conspiracy. The friends of King James had, upon
the death of Queen Mary, renewed their practices for
effecting a restoration of that monarch, on the supposition
that the interest of William was considerably weakened
by the decease of his consort. Certain individuals, whose
zeal for James overshot their discretion, formed a design
to seise the person of King William, and convey him to
France, or put him to death, in case of resistance. They
had sent emissaries to the court of St. Germain's, to de∣mand
a commission for this purpose, which was refused.
The Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Montgomery, son to the
Marquis of Powis, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend,
Captain Charnock, Captain Porter, and one Mr. Good∣man,
were the first contrivers of this project. Charnock
was detached with a proposal to James, that he should
procure a body of horse and foot from France, to make a
descent in England, and they would engage not only to
join him at his landing, but even to replace him on the
<PB N="256" REF="260"/>
throne of England. These offers being declined by James,
on pretence that the French King could not spare such a
number of troops at that juncture, the Earl of Aylesbury
went over in person, and was admitted to a conference
with Louis, in which the scheme of an invasion was
actually concerted. In the beginning of February, the
Duke of Berwick repaired privately to England, where he
conferred with the conspirators, assured them that King
James was ready to make a descent with a considerable
number of French forces, distributed commissions, and
gave directions for providing men, arms, and horses, to
join him at his arrival. When he returned to France, he
found every thing prepared for the expedition. The
troops were drawn down to the sea-side: a great number
of transports were assembled at Dunkirk: Monsieur
Gabaret had advanced as far as Calais with a squadron of
ships, which, when joined by that of Du Bart at Dun∣kirk,
was judged a sufficient convoy; and James had
come as far as Calais, in his way to embark. Mean
while, the Jacobites in England were assiduously employed
in making preparations for a revolt. Sir John Friend had
very near completed a regiment of horse. Considerable
progress was made in levying another by Sir William
Perkins. Sir John Fenwick had enlisted four troops.
Colonel Tempest had undertaken for one regiment of
dragoons: Colonel Parker was preferred to the command
of another: Mr. Curzon was commissioned for a third;
and the malcontents intended to raise a fourth in Suffolk,
where their interest chiefly prevailed.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. While one part of the Jacobites proceeded
against William in the usual way of exciting an insurrec∣tion,
another, consisting of the most desperate conspi∣rators,
had formed a scheme of assassination. Sir George
Barclay, a native of Scotland, who had served as an
officer in the army of James, a man of undaunted
courage, a furious bigot in the religion of Rome, yet
close, circumspect, and determined, was landed, with
other officers, in Romney-marsh, by one Captain Gill,
<PB N="257" REF="261"/>
about the beginning of January, and is said to have un∣dertaken
the task of seising or assassinating King William.
He imparted his design to Harrison, alias Johnston, a
priest, Charnock, Porter, and William Perkins, by whom
it was approved; and he pretended to have a particular
commission for this service. After various consultations,
they resolved to attack the King on his return from
Richmond, where he commonly hunted on Saturdays;
and the scene of their intended ambuscade was a lane
between Brentford and Turnham-green. As it would
be necessary to charge and disperse the guards that at∣tended
the coach, they agreed that their number should
be increased to forty horsemen, and each conspirator be∣gan
to engage proper persons for the enterprise. When
their complement was full, they determined to execute
their purpose on the fifteenth day of February. They
concerted the manner in which they should meet in small
parties without suspicion, and waited with impatience for
the hour of action. In this interval, some of the under∣ling
actors, seised with horror at the reflexion of what
they had undertaken, or captivated with the prospect of
reward, resolved to prevent the execution of the design by
a timely discovery. On the eleventh day of February, one
Fisher informed the Earl of Portland of the scheme, and
named some of the conspirators; but his account was im∣perfect.
On the thirteenth, however, he returned with a
circumstantial detail of all the particulars. Next day, the
Earl was accosted by one Pendergrass, an Irish officer,
who told his lordship he had just come from Hampshire,
at the request of a particular friend, and understood that
he had been called up to town with a view of engaging
him in a design to assassinate King William. He said, he
had promised to embark in the undertaking, though
he detested it in his own mind, and took this first oppor∣tunity
of revealing the secret, which was of such conse∣quence
to his Majesty's life. He owned himself a Roman
catholick, but declared, that he did not think any reli∣gion
could justify such a treacherous purpose. At the
<PB N="258" REF="262"/>
same time he observed, that as he lay under obligations
to some of the conspirators, his honour and gratitude
would not permit him to accuse them by name; and that
he would upon no consideration appear as an evidence.
The King had been so much used to fictitious plots, and
false discoveries, that he paid little regard to these infor∣mations,
until they were confirmed by the testimony of ano∣ther
conspirator called La Rue, a Frenchman, who commu∣nicated
the same particulars to Brigadier Levison, without
knowing the least circumstance of the other discoveries.
Then the King believed there was something real in the con∣spiracy;
and Pendergrass and La Rue were severally ex∣amined
in his presence. He thanked Pendergrass in par∣ticular
for this instance of his probity; but observed,
that it must prove ineffectual, unless he would discover
the names of the conspirators; for, without knowing who
they were, he should not be able to secure his life
against their attempts. At length Pendergrass was pre∣vailed
upon to give a list of those he knew, yet not be∣fore
the King had solemnly promised that he should not
be used as an evidence against them, except with his own
consent. As the King did not go to Richmond on the
day appointed, the conspirators postponed the execution
of their design till the Saturday following. They accord∣ingly
met at different houses on the Friday, when every
man received his instructions. There they agreed, that
after the perpetration of the parricide, they should ride in
a body as far as Hammersmith, and then dispersing, enter
London by different avenues. But, on the morning,
when they understood that the guards were returned to
their quarters, and the King's coaches sent back to the
Mews, they were seised with a sudden damp, on the sup∣position
that their plot was discovered. Sir George
Barclay withdrew himself, and every one began to think
of providing for his own safety. Next night, however, a
great number of them were apprehended, and then the
whole discovery was communicated to the privy-coun∣cil.
A proclamation was issued against those that ab∣sconded;
<PB N="259" REF="263"/>
and great diligence was used to find Sir George
Barclay, who was supposed to have a particular commis∣sion
from James for assassinating the Prince of Orange:
but he made good his retreat, and it was never proved
that any such commission had been granted.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. This design and the projected invasion
proved equally abortive. James had scarce reached Calais,
when the Duke of Wirtemberg dispatched his alde-de-camp
from Flanders to King William, with an account
of the purposed descent. Expresses with the same tidings
arrived from the Elector of Bavaria and the Prince de
Vaudemont. Two considerable squadrons being ready
for sea, Admiral Russel embarked at Spithead, and stood
over to the French coast with above fifty sail of the line.
The enemy were confounded at his appearance, and
hauled in their vessels under the shore, in such shallow
water that he could not follow and destroy them: but he
absolutely ruined their design, by cooping them up in
their harbours. King James, after having tarried some
weeks at Calais, returned to St. Germain's. The forces
were sent back to their garrisons from which they had
been drafted: the people of France exclaimed, that the
malignant star which ruled the destiny of James had blast∣ed
this, and every other project formed for his restora∣tion.
By means of the reward offered in the proclamation,
the greater part of the conspirators were betrayed or ta∣ken.
George Harris, who had been sent from France, with
orders to obey Sir George Barclay, surrendered himself to
Sir William Trumball, and confessed the scheme of assas∣sination
in which he had been engaged. Porter and Pen∣dergrass
were apprehended together. This last insisted up∣on
the King's promise, that he should not be compelled
to give evidence: but, when Porter owned himself guilty,
the other observed, he was no longer bound to be silent,
as his friend had made a confession; and they were both
admitted as evidences for the crown.</P>
<P>§ XXX. After their examination, the King, in a speech
to both Houses, communicated the nature of the conspi∣racy
<PB N="260" REF="264"/>
against his life, as well as the advices he had received
touching the invasion: he explained the steps he had ta∣ken
to defeat the double design, and professed his con∣fidence
in their readiness and zeal to concur with him in
every thing that should appear necessary for their com∣mon
safety. That same evening the two Houses waited
upon him at Kensington, in a body, with an affectionate
address, by which they expressed their abhorrence of the
villainous and barbarous design which had been formed
against his sacred person, of which they besought him to
take more than ordinary care. They assured him they
would to their utmost defend his life, and support his go∣vernment
against the late King James, and all other ene∣mies;
and declared, that in case his Majesty should come
to a violent death, they would revenge it upon his adver∣saries
and their adherents. He was extremely well pleased
with this warm address, and assured them, in his turn, he
would take all opportunities of recommending himself to
the continuance of their loyalty and affection. The
Commons forthwith empowered him, by bill, to secure
all persons suspected of conspiring against his person and
government. They brought in another, providing, That
in case of his Majesty's death, the parliament then in be∣ing
should continue until dissolved by the next heir in
succession to the crown, established by act of parliament:
that if his Majesty should chance to die between two
parliaments, that which had been last dissolved, should
immediately re-assemble, and sit for the dispatch of na∣tional
affairs. They voted an address, to desire, That his
Majesty would banish by proclamation, all papists to the
distance of ten miles from the cities of London and
Westminster; and give instructions to the judges going
on the circuits, to put the laws in execution against Ro∣man
catholicks and nonjurors. They drew up an associa∣tion,
binding themselves to assist each other in support
of the King and his government; and to revenge any
violence that should be committed on his person. This
was signed by all the members then present; but, as
<PB N="261" REF="265"/>
some had absented themselves on frivolous pretences, the
House ordered, That in sixteen days the absentees should
either subscribe, or declare their refusal. Several members
neglecting to comply with this injunction within the
limited time, the Speaker was ordered to write to those
who were in the country, and demand a peremptory an∣swer;
and the clerk of the House attended such as pre∣tended
to be ill in town. The absentees, finding them∣selves
pressed in this manner, thought proper to sail with
the stream, and sign the association, which was presented
to the King by the Commons in a body, with a request,
that it might be lodged among the records in the Tower,
as a perpetual memorial of their loyalty and affection.
The King received them with uncommon complacency;
declared, that he heartily entered into the same associa∣tion;
that he should be always ready to venture his life
with his good subjects, against all who should endeavour
to subvert the religion, laws, and liberties of England;
and he promised that this, and all other associations,
should be lodged among the records in the Tower of
London. Next day the Commons resolved, That who∣ever
should affirm an association was illegal should be
deemed a promoter of the designs of the late King James,
and an enemy to the laws and liberties of the kingdom.
The Lords followed the example of the Lower House in
drawing up an association; but the Earl of Nottingham,
Sir Edward Seymour, and Mr. Finch, objected to the
words Rightful and Lawful, as applied to his Majesty.
They said, as the crown and its prerogatives were vested
in him, they would yield obedience, though they could
not acknowledge him as their rightful and lawful King.
Nothing could be more absurd than this distinction started
by men who had actually constituted part of the admi∣nistration;
unless they supposed that the right of King
William expired with Queen Mary. The Earl of Ro∣chester
proposed an expedient in favour of such tender
consciences, by altering the words that gave offence; and
this was adopted accordingly. Fifteen of the peers, and
<PB N="262" REF="266"/>
ninety-two commoners signed the association with re∣luctance.
It was, however, subscribed by all sorts of
people in different parts of the kingdom; and the bishops
drew up a form for the clergy, which was signed by a
great majority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet Oldmixon. Boyer. Tindal. Ralph. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> The Commons brought in a bill, declar∣ing
all men incapable of public trust, or of sitting in par∣liament,
who would not engage in this association. At
the same time, the council issued an order for renewing
all the commissions in England, that those who had not
signed it voluntarily should be dismissed from the service
as disaffected persons.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. After these warm demonstrations of loyalty,
the Commons proceeded upon ways and means for raising
the supplies. A new bank was constituted as a fund, upon
which the sum of two millions, five hundred and sixty-four
thousand pounds should be raised; and it was called
the Land Bank, because established on land securities.
This scheme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1696.</NOTE> said to have been projected by the famous
Doctor Chamberlain, was patronised by the Earl of Sun∣derland,
and managed by Foley and Harley: so that it
seemed to be a Tory plan, which Sunderland supported,
in order to reconcile himself to that party.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Commons resolved, That a fund redeemable by parliament be settled in a national land bank, to be raised by new subscriptions: That no person be concerned in both banks at the same time: That the duties upon coa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, culm, and tonnage of ships, be taken off, from the seventeenth day of March: That the sum of two millions, five hundred and sixty-four thousand pounds be raised on this perpetual fund, redeemable by parliament: That the new bank should be restrained from lending money but upon land securiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or to the government in the Exchequer: That for making up the fund of in∣terest for the capital s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock, certain duties upon glas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, stone, and ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then bottles, granted before to the King for a term of years, be continued to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Majesty, his heirs, and successors: That a further duty be laid upon stone and earthen ware, and another upon tobacco pipes. This bank was to lend out five hundred thousand pounds a-year upon land-securities, at three pounds ten shillings per cent. per annum, and to cease and determine, unless the sub∣scription should be full by the first day of August next ensuing.</P>
<P>The most remarkable laws enacted in this session were these: An act for voiding all the elections of parliament men, at which the elected had been at any expense in meat, drink, or money, to procure votes. Another against unlawful and double returns. A third, for the more easy recovery of small <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes. A fourth, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prevent marriages, without licence or banns. A fifth, for enabling the inhabitants of Wales to dispose of all their personal estates as they should think fit. This law was in bar of a custom that had prevailed in that country. The widows and younger children claimed a share of the effects, called their Reasonable part, although the effects had been other∣wise disposed of by wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l or deed. The parliament likewise passed an act, for preventing the exportation of wool, and encouraging the importation thereof from Ireland. An act for encouraging the linen manufactures of Ire∣land. An act for regulating injuries. An act for encouraging the Greenland trade. An act for indu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gence to the quakers, that their solemn affirmation should be accepted instead of an oath. And an act for continuing certain other acts that were near expiring. Another bill had passed for the better regulating elections for members of parliament; but the royal assent was de∣nied. The question was put in the House of Commons, That whosoever ad∣vised his Majesty not to give his assent to that bill was an enemy to his coun∣try; but it was rejected by a great majority.</P></NOTE> The Bank
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
of England petitioned against this bill, and were heard by
their counsel: but their representations produced no effect,
and the bill having passed through both Houses, received
the royal assent. On the twenty-seventh day of April the
King closed the session with a short but gracious speech;
and the parliament was prorogued to the sixteenth day of
June.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. Before this period some of the conspirators had
been brought to trial. The first who suffered was Robert
Charnock, one of the two fellows of Magdalen college,
who, in the reign of James, had renounced the protestant
religion: the next were Lieutenant King, and Thomas
Keys, which last had been formerly a trumpeter, but of
late servant to Captain Porter. They were found guilty
of high treason, and executed at Tyburn. They delivered
papers to the Sheriff, in which they solemnly declared,
that they had never seen or heard of any commission from
King James for assassinating the Prince of Orange: Char∣nock,
in particular, observed, that he had received frequent
assurances of the King's having rejected such proposals
when they had been offered; and that there was no other
commission but that for levying war in the usual form. Sir
John Friend and Sir William Perkins were tried in April.
The first from mean beginnings had acquired great wealth
and credit, and always firmly adhered to the interests of
King James. The other was likewise a man of fortune,
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>
violently attached to the same principles, though he had
taken the oaths to the present government, as one of the
six clerks in Chancery. Porter and Blair, another evidence,
deposed, that Sir John Friend had been concerned in levy∣ing
men under a commission from King James; and that
he knew of the assassination plot, though not engaged in it
as a personal actor. He endeavoured to invalidate the
testimony of Blair, by proving him guilty of the most
shocking ingratitude. He observed, that both the evidences
were reputed papists. The curate of Hackney, who offi∣ciated
as chaplain in the prisoner's house, declared upon
oath, that after the Revolution he used to pray for King
William; and that he had often heard Sir John Friend
say, that though he could not comply with the present
government, he would live peaceably under it, and never
engage in any conspiracy. Mr. Hoadly, father of the
present Bishop of Winchester, added, that the prisoner
was a good protestant, and frequently expressed his detest∣ation
of king-killing principles. Friend himself owned
he had been with some of the conspirators at a meeting
in Leadenhall-street, but heard nothing of raising men,
or any design against the government. He likewise
affirmed that a consultation to levy war was not treason;
and that his being at a treasonable consult could amount
to no more than a misprision of treason. Lord-Chief-Justice
Holt declared, that although a bare conspiracy, or
design to levy war, was not treason within the statute of
Edward III. yet, if the design or conspiracy be to kill, or
depose, or imprison the king, by the means of levying war,
then the consultation and conspiracy to levy war becomes
high-treason, though no war be actually levied. The same
inference might have been drawn against the authors and
instruments of the Revolution. The judge's explanation
influenced the jury, who after some deliberation found the
prisoner guilty. Next day Sir William Perkins was brought
to the bar, and upon the testimony of Porter, Ewebank
his own groom, and Haywood, a notorious informer, was
convicted of having been concerned, not only in the in∣vasion,
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
but also in the design against the King's life. The
evidence was scanty, and the prisoner having being bred to
the law, made an artful and vigorous defence: but the
judge acted as council for the crown; and the jury decided
by the hints they received from the bench. He and Sir
John Friend underwent the sentence of death, and suffered
at Tyburn on the third day of April. Friend protested
before God, that he knew of no immediate descent pur∣posed
by King James, and therefore had made no prepa∣rations:
that he was utterly ignorant of the assassination
scheme: that he died in the communion of the church of
England, and laid down his life chearfully in the cause
for which he suffered. Perkins declared, upon the word
of a dying man, that the tenour of the King's commission
which he saw, was general, directed to all his loving sub∣jects,
to raise and levy war against the Prince of Orange
and his adherents, and to seise all forts, castles, &amp;c. but
that he neither saw nor heard of any commission particu∣larly
levelled against the person of the Prince of Orange.
He owned, however, that he was privy to the design: but
believed it was known to few or none but the immediate
undertakers. These two criminals were in their last mo∣ments
attended by Collier, Snatt, and Cook, three non∣juring
clergymen, who absolved them in the view of the
populace, with an imposition of hands: a publick insult
on the government which did not pass unnoticed. Those
three clergymen were presented by the grand-jury, for
having countenanced the treason by absolving the traitors,
and thereby encouraged other persons to disturb the peace
of the kingdom. An indictment being preferred against
them, Cook and Snatt were commited to Newgate: but,
Collier absconded, and published a vindication of their con∣duct,
in which he affirmed, that the imposition of hands
was the general practice of the primitive church. On the
other hand, the two metropolitans, and twelve other bi∣shops
subscribed a declaration, condemning the admini∣stration
of absolution without a previous confession made,
and abhorrence expressed by the prisoners of the heinous
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>
crimes for which they suffered. In the course of the same
month, Rookwood, Cranborne, and Lowick, were tried
as conspirators, by a special commission, in the King's
Bench; and convicted on the joint testimony of Porter,
Harris, La Rue, Bertram, Fisher, and Pendergrass. Some
favourable circumstances appeared in the case of Lowick.
The proof of his having been concerned in the design
against the King's life was very defective: many persons
of reputation declared he was an honest, good-natured, in-offensive
man: and he himself concluded his defence with
the most solemn protestation of his own innocence. Great
intercession was made for his pardon by some noblemen:
but all their interest proved ineffectual. Cranborne died
in a transport of indignation, leaving a paper, which the
government thought proper to suppress. Lowick and
Rookwood likewise delivered declarations to the sheriff,
the contents of which, as being less inflammatory, were
allowed to be published. Both solemnly denied any know∣ledge
of a commission from King James, to assassinate the
Prince of Orange: the one affirming, that he was incapa∣ble
of granting such an order; and the other asserting that
he, the best of kings, had often rejected proposals of that
nature. Lowick owned that he would have joined the
King at his landing: but declared, he had never been
concerned in any bloody affair during the whole course of
his life. On the contrary, he said, he had endeavoured to
prevent bloodshed as much as lay in his power; and that
he would not kill the most miserable creature in the world,
even though such an act would save his life, restore his
sovereign, and make him one of the greatest men in En∣gland.
Rookwood alledged, he was engaged by his im∣mediate
commander, whom he thought it was his duty to
obey, though the service was much against his judgement
and inclination. He professed his abhorrence of treachery
even to an enemy. He forgave all mankind, even the
Prince of Orange, who, as a soldier, he said, ought to
have considered his case before he signed his death warrant:
he prayed God would open his eyes, and render him
<PB N="267" REF="271"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensible of the blood that was from all parts crying against
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, so as he might avert a heavier execution than that
which he now ordered to be inflicted. The next person
brought to trial, was Mr. Cooke, son of Sir Miles Cooke,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of the six clerks in Chancery. Porter and Goodman
deposed, that he had been present at two meetings at the
King's-head tavern in Leadenhall-street with the Lords
Aylesbury and Montgomery, Sir William Perkins, Sir John
Fenwick, Sir John Friend, Charnock and Porter. The
evidence of Goodman was invalidated by the testimony of
the landlord and two drawers belonging to the tavern, who
swore that Goodman was not there while the noblemen were
present. The prisoner himself solemnly protested that he was
ever averse to the introduction of foreign forces: that he did
not so much as hear of the intended invasion, until it be∣came
the common topick of conversation; and that he
had never seen Goodman at the King's-head. He declared
his intention of receiving the blessed sacrament, and wished
he might perish in the instant, if he now spoke untruth.
No respect was paid to these asseverations. The Solli∣citor-General
Hawles, and Lord-Chief-Justice Treby,
treated him with great severity in the prosecution and charge
to the jury, by whom he was capitally convicted. After
his condemnation the court-agents tampered with him to
make further discoveries; and after his fate had been
protracted by divers short reprieves, he was sent into
banishment. From the whole tenour of these discoveries
and proceedings, it appears that James had actually me∣ditated
an invasion: that his partisans in England had made
preparations for joining him on his arrival, that a few
desperadoes of that faction had concerted a scheme against
the life of King William: that in prosecuting the con∣spirators
the court had countenanced informers: that the
judges had strained the law, wrested circumstances, and
even deviated from the function of their office, to convict
the prisoners: in a word, that the administration had used
the same arbitrary and unfair practices against those un∣happy
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
people, which they themselves had in the late reigns
numbered among the grievances of the kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The warmth, however, manifested on this
occasion may have been owing to national resentment of
the purposed invasion. Certain it is, the two Houses of
parliament, and the people in general, were animated with
extraordinary indignation against France at this juncture.
The Lords besought his Majesty, in a solemn address,
to appoint a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God,
for having defeated the barbarous purpose of his ene∣mies;
and this was observed with uncommon zeal and de∣votion.
Admiral Russel leaving a squadron for observa∣tion
on the French coast, returned to the Downs: but
Sir Cloudesley Shovel being properly prepared for the ex∣pedition,
subjected Calais to another bombardment, by
which the town was set on fire in different parts, and the
inhabitants were overwhelmed with consternation. The
generals of the allied army in Flanders resolved to make some
immediate retaliation upon the French for their unmanly
design upon the life of King William, as they took it for
granted that Louis was accessory to the scheme of assassi∣nation.
That monarch, on the supposition that a power∣ful
diversion would be made by the descent on England,
had established a vast magazine at Givet, designing, when
the allies should be enfeebled by the absence of the British
troops, to strike some stroke of importance early in the
campaign. On this the confederates now determined to
wreak their vengeance. In the beginning of March the
Earl of Athlone and Monsieur de Coehorn, with the con∣currence
of the Duke of Holstein-Ploen, who commanded
the allies, sent a strong detachment of horse, drafted from
Brussels and the neighbouring garrisons, to amuse the
enemy on the side of Charleroy; while they assembled
forty squadrons, thirty battalions, with fifteen pieces of
cannon, and six mortars, in the territory of Namur.
Athlone with part of this body invested Dinant, while
Coehorn, with the remainder, advanced to Givet. He
<PB N="269" REF="273"/>
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthwith began to batter and bombard the place, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three hours was on fire, and by four in the afternoon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holly destroyed, with the great magazine it contained.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen the two generals joining their forces, returned to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amur without interruption. Hitherto the republick of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enice had deferred acknowledging King William: but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow they sent an extraordinary embassy for that purpose,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsisting of Signiors Soranzo and Venier, who arrived in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondon, and on the first day of May had a publick au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience.
The King, on this occasion, knighted Soranzo as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he senior ambassador, and presented him with the sword,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccording to custom. On that day, too, William declared
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> council, that he had appointed the same regency which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad governed the kingdom during his last absence; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbarking on the seventh at Margate, arrived at Orange∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>older
in the evening, under convoy of Vice-Admiral
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ylmer. This officer had been ordered to attend with a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quadron, as the famous Du Bart still continued at Dun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irk,
and some attempt of importance was apprehended
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom his enterprising genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some promotions were made before the King left England. George <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amilton, third son of the duke of that name, was, for his military service<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ireland and Flanders, created Earl of Orkney. Sir John Lowther was en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obled by the title of Baron Lowther, and Viscount Lonsdale; Sir John Thomson made Baron of Haversham, and the celebrated John Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke appoint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d one of the commissioners of Trade and Plantations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The French had taken the field before the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llied army could be assembled: but no transaction of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsequence distinguished this campaign, either upon the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hine or in Flanders. The scheme of Louis was still de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensive
on the side of the Netherlands, while the active
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lans of King William were defeated by want of money.
All the funds for this year proved defective: the land∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank
failed, and the national bank sustained a rude shock
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n its credit. The loss of the nation upon the recoinage
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mounted to two millions, two hundred thousand pounds;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd though the different mints were employed without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterruption, they could not for some months supply the
<PB N="270" REF="274"/>
circulation, especially as great part of the new money was
kept up by those who received it in payment, or disposed
of at an unreasonable advantage. The French King
having exhausted the wealth and patience of his subjects,
and greatly diminished their number in the course of this
war, began to be diffident of his arms, and employed all
the arts of private negociation. While his minister
D'Avaux pressed the King of Sweden to offer his media∣tion,
he sent Callieres to Holland, with proposals for
settling the preliminaries of a treaty. He took it for
granted, that as the Dutch were a trading people, whose
commerce had greatly suffered in the war, they could not
be averse to a pacification; and he instructed his emissa∣ries
to tamper with the malcontents of the republick,
especially with the remains of the Louvestein faction,
which had always opposed the schemes of the Stadtholder.
Callieres met with a favourable reception from the States,
which began to treat with him about the preliminaries▪
though not without the consent and concurrence of King
William and the rest of the allies. Louis, with a view
to quicken the effect of this negociation, pursued offensive
measures in Catalonia, where his general, the Duke d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Vendome attacked and worsted the Spaniards in thei
camp near Ostalrick, though the action was not decisive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for that General was obliged to retreat, after having made
vigorous efforts against their entrenchments. On the
twentieth day of June, Mareschal de Lorges passed th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Rhine at Philipsburgh, and encamped within a league o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Eppingen, where the Imperial troops were obliged to
entrench themselves, under the command of the Prince
of Baden, as they were not yet joined by the auxiliary
forces. The French general after having faced hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
about a month, thought proper to repass the river. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he detached a body of horse to Flanders, and cantone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the rest of his troops at Spires, Franckendab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Worms
and Ostofen. On the last day of August the Prince o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Baden retaliated the insult, by passing the Rhine a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mentz and Cocsheim. On the tenth he was joined by
<PB N="271" REF="275"/>
General Thungen, who commanded a separate body,
together with the militia of Suabia and Franconia, and
advanced to the camp of the enemy, who had reassembled:
but they were posted in such a manner, that he would
not hazard an attack. Having, therefore, cannonaded
them for some days, scoured the adjacent country by de∣tached
parties, and taken the little castle of Wiezengen,
he repassed the river at Worms, on the seventh day of
October: the French likewise crossed at Philipsburgh, in
hopes of surprising General Thungen, who had taken post
in the neighbourhood of Strasbourg: but he retired to
Eppingen before their arrival, and in a little time both
armies were distributed in winter quarters. Peter, the
Czar of Muscovy, carried on the siege of Azoph with such
vigour, that the garrison was obliged to capitulate, after
the Russians had defeated a great convoy sent to its relief.
The court of Vienna forthwith engaged in an alliance
with the Muscovite emperor: but, they did not exert
themselves in taking advantage of the disaster which the
Turks had undergone. The Imperial army, commanded
by the Elector of Saxony, continued inactive on the river
Marosch till the nineteenth day of July, then they made
a feint of attacking Temiswaer: but they marched to∣wards
Betzkerch, in their route to Belgrade, on receiving
advice that the Grand Signor intended to besiege Titul.
On the twenty-first day of August the two armies were in
sight of each other. The Turkish horse attacked the
Imperialists in a plain near the river Begue; but were
repulsed. The Germans next day made a show of re∣treating,
in hopes of drawing the enemy from their en∣trenchments.
The stratagem succeeded. On the twenty∣sixth,
the Turkish army was in motion. A detachment
of the Imperialists attacked them in flank, as they marched
through a wood. A very desperate action ensued, in
which the Generals Heusler and Poland, with many other
gallant officers, lost their lives. At length, the Ottoman
horse were routed: but the Germans were so roughly
handled, that on the second day after the engagement
<PB N="272" REF="276"/>
they retreated at midnight, and the Turks remained quie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in their entrenchments.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. In Piedmont the face of affairs underwent a
strange alteration. The Duke of Savoy, who had for
some time been engaged in a secret negociation with
France, at length embraced the offers of that crown, and
privately signed a separate treaty of peace at Loretto, to
which place he repaired on a pretended pilgrimage. The
French King engaged to present him with four millions
of livres, by way of reparation for the damage he had
sustained; to assist him with a certain number of auxilia∣ries
against all his enemies; and to effect a marriage be∣tween
the Duke of Burgundy and the Princess of Pied∣mont,
as soon as the parties should be marriageable. The
treaty was guarantied by the Pope and the Venetians, who
were extremely desirous of seeing the Germans driven out
of Italy. King William being apprised of this negocia∣tion,
communicated the intelligence to the Earl of Gal∣way,
his ambassador at Turin, who expostulated with the
Duke upon his defection: but he persisted in denying any
such correspondence, until the advance of the French
army enabled him to avow it without fearing the resent∣ment
of the allies whom he had abandoned. Catinat
marched into the plains of Turin, at the head of fifty
thousand men; an army greatly superior to that of the
confederates. Then the Duke imparted to the ministers
of the allies the proposals which France had made; re∣presented
the superior strength of her army; the danger to
which he was exposed; and finally his inclination to em∣brace
her offers. On the twelfth of July a truce was
concluded for a month, and afterwards prolonged till the
fifteenth of September. He wrote to all the powers en∣gaged
in the confederacy, except King William, expa∣tiating
on the same topics, and solliciting their consent.
Though each in particular refused to concur, he on the
twenty-third day of August signed the treaty in publick,
which he had before concluded in private. The Emperor
was no sooner informed of his design, then he took every
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
step which he thought could divert him from his purpose.
He sent the Count Mansfeldt to Turin, with proposals
for a match between the King of the Romans and the
Princess of Savoy, as well as with offers to augment his
forces and his subsidy: but the Duke had already settled
his terms with France, from which he would not recede.
Prince Eugene, though his kinsman, expressed great indig∣nation
at his conduct. The young Prince de Commercy
was so provoked at his defection, that he challenged him
to single combat, and the Duke accepted of his challenge:
but the quarrel was compromised by the intervention of
friends, and they parted in an amicable manner. He had
concealed the treaty until he should receive the remaining
part of the subsidies due to him from the confederates. A
considerable sum had been remitted from England to Genoa
for his use: but Lord Galway no sooner received intima∣tion
of his new engagement, than he put a stop to the
payment of this money, which he employed in the Mila∣nese,
for the subsistence of those troops that were in the
British service. King William was encamped at Gem∣blours
when the Duke's envoy notified the separate peace
which his master had concluded with the King of France.
Though he was extremely chagrined at the information,
he dissembled his anger, and listened to the minister with∣out
the least emotion. One of the conditions of this treaty
was, That within a limited time the allies should evacuate
the Duke's dominions, otherwise they should be expelled
by the joint forces of France and Savoy. A neutrality
was offered to the confederates; and this being rejected,
the contracting powers resolved to attack the Milanese.
Accordingly, when the truce expired, the Duke, as gene∣ralissimo
of the French King, entered that duchy, and
undertook the siege of Valentia; so that, in one cam∣paign,
he commanded two contending armies. The
garrison of Valentia, consisting of seven thousand men,
Germans, Spaniards, and French protestants, made an
obstinate defence; and the Duke of Savoy prosecuted the
siege with uncommon impetuosity. But, after the trenches
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
had been open for thirteen days, a courier arrived from
Madrid, with an account of his Catholick Majesty's hav∣ing
agreed to the neutrality for Italy. This agreement
imported, That there should be a suspension of arms
until a general peace could be effected; and, That the
Imperial and French troops should return to their re∣spective
countries. Christendom had well nigh been em∣broiled
anew by the death of John Sobieski King of Po∣land,
who died at the age of seventy, in the course of this
summer, after having survived his faculties and reputa∣tion.
As the crown was elective, a competition arose for
the succession. The kingdom was divided by factions;
and the different powers in Europe interested themselves
warmly in the contention.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. Nothing of consequence had been lately
atchieved by the naval force of England. When the
conspiracy was first discovered, Sir George Rooke had
received orders to return from Cadix; and he arrived in
the latter end of April. While he took his place at the
board of Admiralty, Lord Berkeley succeeded to the com∣mand
of the fleet; and in the month of June set sail to∣wards
Ushant, in order to insult the coast of France. He
pillaged and burned the villages on the islands Grouais,
Houat, and Heydic; made prize of about twenty vessels;
bombarded St. Martin's on the isle of Rhe, and the town
of Olonne, which was set on fire in fifteen different places
with the shells and carcasses. Though these appear to
have been enterprises of small import, they certainly kept
the whole coast of France in perpetual alarm. The mi∣nistry
of that kingdom were so much afraid of invasion,
that between Brest and Goulet they ordered above one
hundred batteries to be erected, and above sixty thousand
men were continually in arms, for the defence of the mari∣time
places. In the month of May Rear-Admiral Benbow
sailed with a small squadron, in order to block up Du
Bart in the harbour of Dunkirk: but that famous ad∣venturer
found means to escape in a fog, and steering to
the eastward, attacked the Dutch fleet in the Baltick,
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
under a convoy of five frigates. These last he took, toge∣ther
with half the number of the trading ships: but,
falling in with the outward-bound fleet, convoyed by
thirteen ships of the line, he was obliged to burn four of
the frigates, turn the fifth adrift, and part with all his
prizes except fifteen, which he carried into Dunkirk.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The parliament of Scotland met on the
eighth day of September; and Lord Murray, secretary of
state, now Earl of Tullibardine, presided as King's Com∣missioner.
Though that kingdom was exhausted by the
war, and two successive bad harvests, which had driven a
great number of the inhabitants into Ireland, there was
no opposition to the court-measures. The members of
parliament signed an association like that of England.
They granted a supply of one hundred and twenty thou∣sand
pounds for maintaining their forces by sea and land.
They passed an act for securing their religion, lives, and
properties, in case his Majesty should come to an untimely
death. By another, they obliged all persons in publick
trust to sign the association; and then the parliament was
adjourned to the eighth day of December. The disturb∣ances
of Ireland seemed now to be entirely appeased. Lord
Capel dying in May, the council, by virtue of an act
passed in the reign of Henry VIII. elected the Chancellor,
Sir Charles Porter, to be Lord Justice and chief governour
of that kingdom, until his Majesty's pleasure should be
known. The parliament met in June: the Commons
expelled Mr. Sanderson, the only member of that House
who had refused to sign the association; and adjourned
to the fourth day of August. By that time Sir Charles
Porter, and the Earls of Montrath and Drogheda, were
appointed Lords Justices, and signified the King's plea∣sure
that they should adjourn. In the beginning of De∣cember
the Chancellor died of an apoplexy.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. King William being tired of an inactive
campaign, left the army under the command of the
Elector of Bavaria, and, about the latter end of August
repaired to his palace at Loo, where he enjoyed his fa∣vourite
<PB N="276" REF="280"/>
exercise of stag-hunting. He visited the court of
Brandenburgh at Cleves; conferred with the States of
Holland at the Hague; and, embarking for England,
landed at Margate on the sixth day of October. The do∣mestick
oeconomy of the nation was extremely perplexed
at this juncture, from the sinking of publick credit, and
the stagnation that necessarily attended a recoinage. These
grievances were with difficulty removed by the clear ap∣prehension,
the enterprising genius, the unshaken forti∣tude
of Mr. Montagu, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
operating upon a national spirit of adventure, which the
monied-interest had produced. The King opened the
session of parliament on the twentieth day of October,
with a speech, importing, That overtures had been made
for a negociation; but that the best way of treating with
France would be sword in hand. He, therefore, desired
they would be expeditious in raising the supplies for the
service of the ensuing year, as well as for making good
the funds already granted. He declared, that the civil
list could not be supported without their assistance. He
recommended the miserable condition of the French pro∣testants
to their compassion. He desired they would con∣trive
the best expedients for the recovery of the national
credit. He observed, that unanimity and dispatch were
now more than ever necessary for the honour, safety, and
advantage of England. The Commons having taken this
speech into consideration, resolved, That they would
support his Majesty and his government, and assist him in
the prosecution of the war: That the standard of gold and
silver should not be altered: and, That they would make
good all parliamentary funds. Then they presented an
address, in a very spirited strain, declaring that, notwith∣standing
the blood and treasure of which the nation had
been drained, the Commons of England would not be
diverted from their firm resolutions of obtaining by war a
safe and honourable peace. They, therefore, renewed
their assurances, that they would support his Majesty
against all his enemies at home and abroad. The House
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
of Lords delivered another to the same purpose, declaring,
that they would never be wanting or backward, on their
parts, in what might be necessary to his Majesty's honour,
the good of his kingdoms, and the quiet of Christendom.
The Commons, in the first transports of their zeal, or∣dered
two seditious pamphlets to be burned by the hands
of the common hangman. They deliberated upon the
estimates, and granted above six millions for the service of
the ensuing year. They resolved, that a supply should
be granted for making good the deficiency of parliamen∣tary
funds; and appropriated several duties for this pur∣pose.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. With respect to the coin, they brought in
a bill, repealing an act for taking off the obligation and
encouragement of coining guineas for a certain time, and
for importing and coining guineas and half-guineas, as
the extravagant price of those coins, which occasioned this
act, was now fallen. They passed a second bill for reme∣dying
the ill state of the coin; and a third, explaining
an act in the preceding session, for laying duties on low
wines and spirits of the first extraction. In order to raise
the supplies of the year, they resolved to tax all persons
according to the true value of their real and personal
estates, their stock upon land and in trade, their income
by offices, pensions, and professions. A duty of one
penny per week, for one year, was laid upon all persons
not receiving alms. A further imposition of one farthing
in the pound per week was fixed upon all servants re∣ceiving
four pounds per annum, as wages, and upwards,
to eight pounds a-year inclusive. Those who received
from eight to sixteen pounds were taxed at one-half-penny
per pound. An aid of three shillings in the pound
for one year was laid upon all lands, tenements, and he∣reditaments,
according to their true value. Without
specifying the particulars of those impositions, we shall
only observe, that in the general charge, the Commons
did not exempt one member of the commonwealth that
could be supposed able to bear any part of the burthen.
<PB N="278" REF="282"/>
Provision was made, that hammered money should be re∣ceived
in payment of these duties, at the rate of five
shillings and eight pence per ounce. All the deficiencies
on annuities and monies borrowed on the credit of the
Exchequer were transferred to this aid. The Treasury
was enabled to borrow a million and a half at eight per
cent. and to circulate Exchequer-bills to the amount of
as much more. To cancel these debts, the surplus of all
the supplies, except the three-shilling-aid, was appro∣priated.
The Commons voted one hundred and twenty-five
thousand pounds for making good the deficiency in
recoining the hammered money, and the recompence for
bringing in plate to the Mint. This sum was raised by a
tax or duty upon wrought-plate, paper, pasteboard, vellum,
and parchment, made or imported. Taking into consi∣deration
the services, and the present languishing state of
the Bank, whose notes were at twenty per cent. discount,
they resolved, That it should be enlarged by new subscrip∣tions,
made by four-fifths in tallies struck on parliament∣ary
funds, and one-fifth in Bank-bills or notes: That
effectual provision should be made by parliament, for
paying the principal of all such tallies as should be sub∣scribed
into the Bank, out of the funds agreed to be con∣tinued:
That an interest of eight per cent. should be
allowed on all such tallies: and, That the continuance of
the Bank should be prolonged to the first day of August,
in the year one thousand, seven hundred, and ten: That
all assignments of orders on tallies subscribed into the Bank
should be registered in the Exchequer: That, before the
day should be fixed for the beginning of the new subscrip∣tions,
the old should be made one hundred per cent. and
what might exceed that value should be divided among the
old members: That all the interest due on those tallies
which might be subscribed into the Bank-stock, at the
time appointed for-subscriptions, to the end of the last
preceding quarter on each tally, should be allowed as
principal: That liberty should be given by parliament to
enlarge the number of Bank-bills, to the value of the
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
sum that should be so subscribed, over and above the
twelve hundred thousand pounds; provided they should
be obliged to answer such bills and demands, and in de∣fault
thereof, be answered by the Exchequer, out of the
first money due to them: That no other bank should be
erected or allowed by act of parliament, during the con∣tinuance
of the Bank of England: That this should be
exempted from all tax or imposition: That no act of the
corporation should forfeit the particular interest of any
person concerned therein: That provision should be made
to prevent the officers of the Exchequer, and all other
officers and receivers of the revenue, from diverting, de∣laying,
or obstructing the course of payments to the Bank:
That care should be taken to prevent the altering, coun∣terfeiting,
or forging any Bank-bills or notes: That the
estate and interest of each member in the stock of the cor∣poration
should be made a personal estate: That no con∣tract
made for any Bank-stock to be bought or sold should
be valued in law or equity, unless actually registered in
the Bank-books within seven days, and actually trans∣ferred
within fourteen days after the contract should be
made. A bill upon these resolutions was brought in
under the direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
it related to the continuation of tonnage and poundage
upon wine, vinegar, and tobacco; and comprehended a
clause for laying an additional duty upon salt, for two
years and three quarters. All the several branches consti∣tuted
a general fund, since known by the name of the
General Mortgage, without prejudice to their former ap∣propriations.
The bill also provided, That the tallies
should bear eight per cent. interest: That from the tenth
of June for five years they should bear no more than six
per cent. interest: and, That no premium or discount
upon them should be taken. In case of the general fund's
proving insufficient to pay the whole interest, it was pro∣vided,
That every proprietor should receive his proportion
of the product, and the deficiency be made good from the
next aid: but, should the fund produce more than the
<PB N="280" REF="284"/>
interest, the surplus was destined to operate as a sinking
fund for the discharge of the principal. In order to make
up a deficiency of above eight hundred thousand pounds,
occasioned by the failure of the land-bank, additional
duties were laid upon leather: the time was enlarged
for persons to come in and purchase the annuities payable
by several former acts, and to obtain more certain interest
in such annuities.</P>
<P>§ XL. Never were more vigorous measures taken to
support the credit of the government; and never was the
government served by such a set of enterprising under∣takers.
The Commons having received a message from
the King, touching the condition of the civil list, resolved,
That a sum not exceeding five hundred and fifteen thou∣sand
pounds should be granted for the support of the civil
list for the ensuing year, to be raised by a malt tax, and
additional duties upon mum, sweets, cyder, and perry.
They likewise resolved, That an additional aid of one
shilling in the pound should be laid upon land, as an
equivalent for the duty of ten per cent. upon mixed goods.
Provision was made for raising one million four hundred
thousand pounds by a lottery. The Treasury was em∣powered
to issue an additional number of Exchequer-bills,
to the amount of twelve hundred thousand pounds, every
hundred pounds bearing interest at the rate of five-pence a
day, and ten per cent. for circulation: finally, in order to
liquidate the transport-debt, which the funds established
for that purpose had not been sufficient to defray, a money-bill
was brought in, to oblige pedlars and hawkers to take
out licenses, and pay for them at certain stated prices.
One cannot without astonishment reflect upon the pro∣digious
efforts that were made upon this occasion, or con∣sider
without indignation the enormous fortunes that were
raised up by usurers and extortioners from the distresses
of their country. The nation did not seem to know its
own strength, until it was put to this extraordinary trial:
and the experiment of mortgaging funds succeeded so well,
that later ministers have proceeded in the same system,
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
imposing burthen upon burthen, as if they thought the
sinews of the nation could never be overstrained.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The publick credit being thus bolstered up by
the singular address of Mr. Montagu, and the bills passed
for the supplies of the ensuing year, the attention of the
Commons was transferred to the case of Sir John Fenwick,
who had been apprehended in the month of June at New
Romney, in his way to France. He had, when taken,
written a letter to his lady by one Webber, who ac∣companied
him; but this man being seised, the letter
was found, containing such a confession as plainly evinced
him guilty. He then entered into a treaty with the court
for turning evidence, and delivered a long information in
writing, which was sent abroad to his Majesty. He made
no discoveries that could injure any of the Jacobites,
who, by his account, and other concurring testimonies,
appeared to be divided into two parties, known by the
names of Compounders and Noncompounders. The first,
headed by the Earl of Middleton, insisted upon receiving
security from King James, that the religion and liberties
of England should be preserved: whereas, the other party,
at the head of which was the Earl of Melfort, resolved to
bring him in without conditions, relying upon his own
honour and generosity. King William having sent over
an order for bringing Fenwick to trial, unless he should
make more material discoveries, the prisoner, with a view
to amuse the ministry, until he could take other measures
for his own safety, accused the Earls of Shrewsbury,
Marlborough, and Bath, the Lord Godolphin, and Ad∣miral
Russel, of having made their peace with King James,
and engaged to act for his interest. Mean while his lady
and relations tampered with the two witnesses, Porter and
Goodman. The first of these discovered those practices
to the government; and one Clancey, who acted as agent
for Lady Fenwick, was tried, convicted of subornation,
fined, and set in the pillory: but they had succeeded
better in their attempts upon Goodman, who disappeared:
so that one witness only remained, and Fenwick began to
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
think his life was out of danger. Admiral Russel acquaint∣ed
the House of Commons, that he and several persons of
quality had been reflected upon in some informations of
Sir John Fenwick: he, therefore, desired, that he might
have an opportunity to justify his own character. Mr.
Secretary Trumball produced the papers, which having
been read, the Commons ordered, That Sir John Fen∣wick
should be brought to the bar of the House. There he
was exhorted by the Speaker to make an ample discovery;
which, however, he declined, except with the proviso
that he should first receive some security that what he might
say should not prejudice himself. He was ordered to
withdraw, until they should have deliberated on his request.
Then he was called in again, and the keeper told him,
he might deserve the favour of the House, by making a
full discovery. He desired he might be indulged with a
little time to recollect himself, and promised to obey the
command of the House. This favour being denied, he
again insisted upon having security; which they refusing to
grant, he chose to be silent, and was dismissed from the
bar. The House voted, That his informations, reflecting
upon the fidelity of several noblemen, members of the
House, and others, upon hearsay, were false and scanda∣lous,
contrived to undermine the government, and create
jealousies between the King and his subjects, in order to
stifle the conspiracy.</P>
<P>§ XLII. A motion being made, for leave to bring in a
bill to attaint him of high-treason, a warm debate ensued,
and the question being put, was carried in the affirmative
by a great majority. He was furnished with a copy of the
bill., and allowed the use of pen, ink, paper, and counsel.
When he presented a petition, praying that his counsel might
be heard against passing the bill, they made an order, that his
counsel should be allowed to make his defence at the bar
of the House: so that he was surprised into an irregular
trial, instead of being indulged with an opportunity of
offering objections to their passing the bill of attainder.
He was accordingly brought to the bar of the House; and
<PB N="283" REF="287"/>
the bill being read in his hearing, the Speaker called upon
the King's counsel to open the evidence. The prisoner's
counsel objected to their proceeding to trial, alledging,
that their client had not received the least notice of their
purpose, and therefore could not be prepared for his de∣fence;
but that they came to offer their reasons against
the bill. The House after a long debate, resolved, That
he should be allowed further time to produce witnesses in
his defence; that the counsel for the King should likewise
be allowed to produce evidence to prove the treasons of
which he stood indicted; and an order was made for his
being brought to the bar again in three days. In pursu∣ance
of this order he appeared, when the indictment which
had been found against him by the grand jury was pro∣duced;
and Porter was examined as evidence. Then the
record of Clancey's conviction was read; and one Roe
testified, that Dighton, the prisoner's sollicitor, had
offered him an annuity of one hundred pounds, to discredit
the testimony of Goodman. The King's counsel moved,
that Goodman's examination, as taken by Mr. Vernon,
clerk of the council, might be read. Sir J. Powis and
Sir Bartholomew Shower, the prisoner's counsel, warmly
opposed this proposal: they affirmed, that a deposition
taken when the party affected by it was not present to
cross-examine the deposer could not be admitted in a case
of five shillings value: that though the House was not
bound by the rules of inferiour courts, it was nevertheless
bound by the eternal and unalterable rules of justice: that
no evidence, according to the rules of law, could be ad∣mitted
in such a case, but that of living witnesses; and
that the examination of a person who is absent was never
read to supply his testimony. The dispute between the
lawyers on this subject gave rise to a very violent debate
among the members of the House. Sir Edward Seymour,
Sir Richard Temple, Mr. Harley, Mr. Harcourt, Mr.
Manly, Sir Christopher Musgrave, and all the leaders of the
Tory-party, argued against the hardship and injustice of
admitting this information as an evidence. They demon∣strated,
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
that it would be a step contrary to the practices o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all courts of judicature, repugnant to the common notion
of justice and humanity, diametrically opposite to the las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
act for regulating trials in cases of high treason, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
dangerous consequences to the lives and liberties of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
people. On the other hand, Lord Cutts, Sir Thoma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lyttelton, Mr. Montagu, Mr. Smith of the Treasury,
and Trevor, the Attorney-General, affirmed, that the
House was not bound by any form of law whatsoever:
that this was an extraordinary case, in which the safety of
the government was deeply concerned: that though the
common law might require two evidences in cases of trea∣son,
the House had a power of deviating from those rules
in extraordinary cases: that there was no reason to doubt
of Sir John Fenwick's being concerned in the conspiracy:
that he or his friends had tampered with Porter; and that
there were strong presumptions to believe the same practices
had induced Goodman to abscond. In a word, the Tories,
either from party or patriotism, strenuously asserted the
cause of liberty and humanity, by those very arguments
which had been used against them in the former reigns;
while the Whigs, with equal violence and more success,
espoused the dictates of arbitrary power and oppression, in
the face of their former principles, with which they were
now upbraided. At length, the question was put, Whe∣ther
or not the information of Goodman should be read?
and was carried in the affirmative by a majority of seventy-three
voices. Then two of the grand-jury who had found
the indictment, recited the evidence which had been given
to them by Porter and Goodman: lastly, the King's
counsel insisted upon producing the record of Cooke's
conviction, as he had been tried for the same conspiracy.
The prisoner's counsel objected, That if such evidence
was admitted, the trial of one person in the same company
would be the trial of all; and it could not be expected
that they who came to defend Sir John Fenwick only,
should be prepared to answer the charge against Cooke.
This article produced another vehement debate among the
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
members; and the Whigs obtained a second victory.
The record was read, and the King's counsel proceeded
to call on some of the jury who served on Cooke's trial,
to affirm that he had been convicted on Goodman's evi∣dence.
Sir Bartholomew Shower said, he would submit it
to the consideration of the House, Whether it was just
that the evidence against one person should conclude against
another standing at a different bar, in defence of his life?
The parties were again ordered to withdraw; and from
this point arose a third debate, which ended as the two
former, to the disadvantage of the prisoner. The jury
being examined, Mr. Serjeant Gould moved, that
Mr. Vernon might be desired to produce the intercepted
letter from Sir John Fenwick to his lady. The priso∣ner's
counsel warmly opposed this motion, insisting upon
their proving it to be his hand-writing before it could be
used against him; and no further stress was laid on this
evidence. When they were called upon to enter on his
defence, they pleaded incapacity to deliver matters of
such importance after they had been fatigued with twelve
hours attendance.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The House resolved to hear such evidence as
the prisoner had to produce that night. His counsel de∣clared,
that they had nothing then to produce but the copy
of a record; and the second resolution was, that he should
be brought up again next day at noon. He accordingly
appeared at the bar, and Sir J. Powis proceeded on his
defence. He observed, that the bill under consideration
affected the lives of the subjects; and such precedents
were dangerous: that Sir John Fenwick was forthcoming,
in order to be tried by the ordinary methods of justice:
that he was actually under process, had pleaded, and
was ready to stand trial: that if there was sufficient clear
evidence against him, as the King's Serjeant had declared,
there was no reason for his being deprived of the benefit
of such a trial as was the birth-right of every British sub∣ject;
and if there was a deficiency of legal evidence, he
thought this was a very odd reason for the bill. He took
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
notice that even the regicides had the benefit of such a trial:
that the last act for regulating trials in cases of treason
proved the great tenderness of the laws which affected
the life of the subject: and he expressed his surprise that
the very parliament which had passed that law, should
enact another for putting a person to death without any
trial at all. He admitted that there had been many bills
of attainder, but they were generally levelled at outlaws
and fugitives; and some of them had been reversed in the
sequel, as arbitrary and unjust. He urged, that this bill
of attainder did not alledge or say, that Sir John Fenwick
was guilty of the treason for which he had been indicted;
a circumstance which prevented him from producing wit∣nesses
to that and several matters upon which the King's
counsel had expatiated. He said, they had introduced evi∣dence
to prove circumstances not alledged in the bill and
defective evidence of those that were; that Porter was
not examined upon oath: that nothing could be more
severe than to pass sentence of death upon a man, corrupt
his blood, and confiscate his estate, upon parole evidence;
especially of such a wretch, who, by his own confession,
had been engaged in a crime of the blackest nature, not
a convert to the dictates of conscience, but a coward,
shrinking from the danger by which he had been envi∣roned,
and even now drudging for a pardon. He invali∣dated
the evidence of Goodman's examination. He ob∣served,
that the indictment mentioned a conspiracy to call
in a foreign power; but, as this conspiracy had not been
put in practice, such an agreement was not a sufficient
overt-act of treason, according to the opinion of Hawles,
the Sollicitor-General, concerned in this very prosecution.
So saying, he produced a book of remarks, which that
lawyer had published on the cases of Lord Russel, Colonel
Sidney, and others who had suffered death in the reign
of Charles II. This author, (said he) takes notice, that a
conspiracy or agreement to levy war, is not treason without
actually levying war; a sentiment in which he concurred
with Lord Coke, and Lord Chief Justice Hales. He con∣cluded
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
with saying, “We know at present on what ground
we stand; by the statute of Edward III. we know what
treason is; by the two statutes of Edward VI. and the
late act, we know what is proof; by the magna charta
we know we are to be tried <HI>per legem terrae &amp; per judi∣cium
parium,</HI> by the law of the land and the judgment
of our peers: but, if bills of attainder come into fashion,
we shall neither know what is treason, what is evidence,
nor how, nor where we are to be tried.”—He was
seconded by Sir Bartholomew Shower, who spoke with
equal energy and elocution; and their arguments were
answered by the King's counsel. The arguments in favour
of the bill, imported, that the parliament would not in∣terpose,
except in extraordinary cases; that here the
evidence necessary in inferior courts being defective, the
parliament, which was not tied down by legal evidence,
had a right to exert their extraordinary power in punish∣ing
an offender, who would otherwise escape with impu∣nity:
that as the law stood, he was but a sorry politician that
could not ruin the government, and yet elude the statute
of treason: that if a plot, after being discovered, should
not be thoroughly prosecuted, it would strengthen and
grow upon the administration, and probably at length sub∣vert
the government: that it was notorious that parties
were forming for King James; persons were plotting in
every part of the kingdom, and an open invasion was
threatened; therefore, this was a proper time for the
parliament to exert their extraordinary power: that the
English differed from all other nations, in bringing the
witnesses and the prisoner face to face, and requiring two
witnesses in cases of treason: nor did the English law itself
require the same proof in some cases, as in others; for
one witness was sufficient in felony, as well as for the
treason of coining; that Fenwick was notoriously guilty,
and deserved to feel the resentment of the nation: that
he would have been brought to exemplary punishment
in the ordinary course of justice, had he not eluded it, by
corrupting evidence, and withdrawing a witness. If this
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
reasoning be just, the House of Commons has a right to
act in diametrical opposition to the laws in being; and is
vested with a despotick power over the lives and fortunes
of their constituents, for whose protection they are con∣stituted.
Let us, therefore, reflect upon the possibility of a
parliament debauched by the arts of corruption, into ser∣vile
compliance with the designs of an arbitrary prince,
and tremble for the consequence. The debate being finished,
the prisoner was, at the desire of Admiral Russel, ques∣tioned
with regard to the imputations he had fixed upon
that gentleman and others, from hearsay: but he desired
to be excused on account of the risque he ran while un∣der
a double prosecution, if any thing which should es∣cape
him might be turned to his prejudice.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. After he was removed from the bar, Mr.
Vernon, at the desire of the House, re-capitulated the arts
and practices of Sir John Fenwick and his friends, to
procrastinate the trial. The bill was read a second time;
and the Speaker asking, If the question should be put for
its being committed? the House was immediately kindled
into a new flame of contention. Hawles, the Sollicitor-General,
affirmed, that the House in the present case,
should act both as judge and jury. Mr. Harcourt, said,
he knew of no trial for treason but what was confirmed
by magna charta, by a jury, the birthright and darling
privilege of an Englishman, or <HI>per legem terrae,</HI> which
includes impeachments in parliament: that it was a strange
trial where the person accused had a chance to be hanged,
but none to be saved: that he never heard of a juryman
who was not on his oath, nor of a judge who had not
power to examine witnesses upon oath, and who was not
empowered to save the innocent as well as to condemn
the guilty. Sir Thomas Lyttelton was of opinion, that the
parliament ought not to stand upon little niceties and
forms of other courts, when the government was at stake.
Mr. Howe asserted, that to do a thing of this nature,
because the parliament had power to do it, was a
strange way of reasoning: that what was justice and
<PB N="298" REF="293"/>
equity at Westminster-hall, was justice and equity every
where: that one bad precedent in parliament was of
worse consequence than an hundred in Westminster-hall,
because personal or private injuries did not foreclose the
claims of original right; whereas, the parliament could
ruin the nation beyond redemption, because it could
establish tyranny by law. Sir Richard Temple, in argu∣ing
against the bill, observed, that the power of parliament
is to make any law, but the jurisdiction of parliament is to
govern itself by the law: to make a law, therefore, against
all the laws of England, was the <HI>ultimum remedium &amp;
pessimum,</HI> never to be used but in case of absolute necessity.
He affirmed that by this precedent the House overthrew all
the laws of England; first, in condemning a man upon
one witness; secondly, in passing an act without any trial.
The Commons never did nor can assume a jurisdiction of
trying any person: they may for their own information,
hear what can be offered; but, it is not a trial where wit∣nesses
are not upon oath. All bills of attainder have
passed against persons that were dead or fled, or without
the compass of the law: some have been brought in after
trials in Westminster-hall; but none of those have been
called trials, and they were generally reversed. He denied
that the parliament had power to declare any thing treason
which was not treason before. When inferior courts
were dubious, the case might be brought before the par∣liament,
to judge whether it was treason or felony: but,
then they must judge by the laws in being; and this judge∣ment
was not in the parliament by bill, but only in the
House of Lords. Lord Digby, Mr. Harley, and Colonel
Granville, spoke to the same purpose. But their argu∣ments
and remonstrances had no effect upon the majority,
by whom the prisoner was devoted to destruction. The
bill was committed, passed, and sent up to the House
of Lords, where it produced the longest and warmest de∣bates
which had been known since the Restoration. Bishop
Burnet signalised his zeal for the government, by a long
speech in favour of the bill, contradicting some of the
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
fundamental maxims which he had formerly avowed in
behalf of the liberties of the people. At length it was
carried by a majority of seven voices; and one and forty
lords, including eight prelates, entered a protest, couched
in the strongest terms, against the decision.</P>
<P>§ XLV. When the bill received the royal assent,
another act of the like nature passed against Barclay,
Holmes, and nine other conspirators who had fled from
justice, in case they should not surrender themselves on or
before the twenty-fifth day of March next ensuing. Sir
John Fenwick solicited the mediation of the Lords in his
behalf, while his friends implored the royal mercy. The
Peers gave him to understand, that the success of his suit
would depend upon the fullness of his discoveries. He
would have previously stipulated for a pardon; and they
insisted upon his depending on their favour. He hesitated
some time between the fears of infamy and the terrours of
death, which last he at length chose to undergo, rather
than incur the disgraceful character of an informer. He
was complimented with the ax, in consideration of his rank
and alliance with the house of Howard, and suffered on
Tower-hill with great composure. In the paper which
he delivered to the Sheriff, he took God to witness, that
he knew not of the intended invasion, until it was the
common subject of discourse; nor was he engaged in any
shape for the service of King James. He thanked those
noble and worthy persons who had opposed his attainder
in parliament; protested before God, that the information
he gave to the ministry he had received in letters and
messages from France; and observed, that he might have
expected mercy from the Prince of Orange, as he had
been instrumental in saving his life, by preventing the
execution of a design which had been formed against it;
a circumstance which in all probability induced the late
conspirators to conceal their purpose of assassination from
his knowledge. He professed his loyalty to King James,
and prayed Heaven for his speedy restoration.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="295"/>
§ XLVI. While Fenwick's affair was in agitation,
the Earl of Monmouth had set on foot some practices
against the Duke of Shrewsbury. One Matthew Smith,
nephew to Sir William Perkins, had been entertained as
a spy by this nobleman, who finding his intelligence of
very little use or importance, dismissed him as a trouble∣some
dependent. Then he had recourse to the Earl of
Monmouth, into whom he infused unfavourable senti∣ments
of the Duke; insinuating, that he had made great
discoveries, which, from sinister motives, were suppressed.
Monmouth communicated those impressions to the Earl of
Portland, who inlisted Smith as one of his intelligencers.
Copies of the letters he had sent to the Duke of Shrews∣bury
were delivered to Secretary Trumball, sealed up for
the perusal of his Majesty at his return from Flanders.
When Fenwick mentioned the Duke of Shrewsbury in his
discoveries, the Earl of Monmouth resolved to seise the
opportunity of ruining that nobleman. He, by the canal
of the Duchess of Norfolk, exhorted Lady Fenwick to pre∣vail
upon her husband to persist in his accusation, and even
dictated a paper of directions. Fenwick rejected the proposal
with disdain, as a scandalous contrivance; and Monmouth
was so incensed at his refusal, that when the bill of attainder
appeared in the House of Lords, he spoke in favour of it with
peculiar vehemence. Lady Fenwick, provoked at this cruel
outrage, prevailed upon her nephew, the Earl of Carlisle,
to move the House that Sir John might be examined
touching any advices that had been sent to him with re∣lation
to his discoveries. Fenwick being interrogated ac∣cordingly,
gave an account of all the particulars of Mon∣mouth's
scheme, which was calculated to ruin the Duke
of Shrewsbury, by bringing Smith's letters on the carpet.
The Duchess of Norfolk and a confidant were examined,
and confirmed the detection. The House called for Smith's
letters, which were produced by Sir William Trumball.
The Earl of Monmouth was committed to the Tower,
and dismissed from all his employments. He was released,
however, at the end of the session; and the court made up
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
all his losses in private, lest he should be tempted to join
the opposition.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. The Whigs, before they were glutted with
the sacrifice of Fenwick, had determined to let loose their
vengeance upon Sir George Rooke, who was a leader in
the opposite interest. Sir Cloudesley Shovel had been
sent with a squadron to look into Brest, where, according
to the intelligence which the government had received, the
French were employed in preparing for a descent upon
England; but this information was false. They were
busy in equipping an armament for the West-Indies, under
the command of M. Pointis, who actually sailed to the
coast of New-Spain, and took the city of Carthagena.
Rooke had been ordered to intercept the Toulon squadron
in its way to Brest; but his endeavours miscarried. The
Commons, in a committee of the whole House, resolved to
enquire why this fleet was not intercepted? Rooke under∣went
a long examination, and was obliged to produce his
journal, orders, and letters. Shovel and Mitchel were
likewise examined; but, nothing appearing to the pre∣judice
of the Admiral, the House thought proper to desist
from their prosecution. After they had determined on the
fate of Fenwick, they proceeded to enact several laws
for regulating the domestick oeconomy of the nation:
among others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net. Kenn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Oldmixon. State Trials. Tindal. Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph. Liv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Admirals.</NOTE> they passed an act for the more effectual
relief of creditors, in cases of escape, and for preventing
abuses in prisons and pretended privileged places. Ever
since the reformation, certain places in and about the city
of London, which had been sanctuaries during the pre∣valence
of the popish religion, afforded asylum to debtors,
and were become receptacles of desperate persons, who
presumed to set the law at defiance. One of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se places,
called White-Friars, was filled with a crew of russians,
who every day committed acts of violence and outrage:
but this law was so vigorously put in execution, that
they were obliged to abandon the district, which was soon
filled with more creditable inhabitants. On the six∣teenth
day of April, the King closed the session with a
<PB N="293" REF="297"/>
short speech, thanking the parliament for the great sup∣plies
they had so chearfully granted, and expressing his
satisfaction at the measures they had taken for retrieving
the publick credit. Before he quitted the kingdom, he
ventured to produce upon the scene the Earl of Sunder∣land,
who had hitherto prompted his councils behind the
curtain. That politician was now sworn of the privy-council,
and gratified with the office of Lord-Chamber∣lain,
which had been resigned by the Earl of Dorset, a
nobleman of elegant talents, and invincible indolence;
severe and poignant in his writings and remarks upon
mankind in general, but humane, good-natured, and
generous to excess, in his commerce with individuals.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. William having made some promotions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Somers was created a baron, and appointed Lord-Chancellor of England: Admiral Russel was dignified with the title of Earl of Orfo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. In February the Earl of Aylesbury, who had been committed on account of the conspi∣racy, was released upon bail; but, this privilege was denied to Lord Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gomery, who had been imprisoned in Newgate on the same account.</NOTE>,
and appointed a regency, embarked on the twenty-sixth
day of April for Holland, that he might be at hand to
manage the negociation for a general peace. By this time
the preliminaries were settled, between Callieres the
French minister, and Mr. Dykveldt in behalf of the
States-General, who resolved, in consequence of the con∣cessions
made by France, that, in concert with their al∣lies,
the mediation of Sweden might be accepted. The
Emperor and the court of Spain, however, were not satis∣fied
with those concessions: yet, his Imperial Majesty
declared he would embrace the proffered mediation, pro∣vided
the treaty of Westphalia should be re-established;
and provided the King of Sweden would engage to join his
troops with those of the allies, in case France should
break through this stipulation. This proposal being deli∣vered,
the ministers of England and Holland at Vienna,
presented a joint memorial, pressing his Imperial Majesty
to accept the mediation without reserve, and name a place
at which the congress might be opened. The Emperor
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
complied with reluctance. On the fourteenth day of Fe∣bruary,
all the ministers of the allies, except the ambas∣sador
of Spain, agreed to the proposal; and next day sig∣nified
their assent in form to M. Lillienroot, the Swedish
plenipotentiary. Spain demanded, as a preliminary,
that France would agree to restore all the places
mentioned in a long list, which the minister of that
crown presented to the assembly. The Emperor proposed,
that the congress should be held at Aix-la-Chapelle, or
Franckfort, or some other town in Germany. The other
allies were more disposed to negociate in Holland. At
length the French King suggested, that no place would be
more proper than a palace belonging to King William,
called Newbourg-house, situated between the Hague and
Delft, close by the village of Rysvick; and to this propo∣sition
the ministers agreed. Those of England were the
Earl of Pembroke, a virtuous, learned, and popular no∣bleman,
the Lord Villiers, and Sir Joseph Williamson:
France sent Harlay and Crecy to the assistance of Cal∣lieres.
Louis was not only tired of the war, on account
of the misery in which it had involved his kingdom; but
in desiring a peace he was actuated by another motive.
The King of Spain had been for some time in a very
ill state of health, and the French monarch had an
eye to the succession. This aim could not be accom∣plished
while the confederacy subsisted; therefore, he
eagerly sought a peace, that he might at once turn his
whole power against Spain, as soon as Charles should
expire. The Emperor harboured the same design upon
the Spanish crown, and for that reason interested him∣self
in the continuance of the grand alliance. Be∣sides,
he foresaw he should in a little time be able to
act against France with an augmented force. The Czar
of Muscovy had engaged to find employment for the
Turks and Tartars. He intended to raise the Elector of
Saxony to the throne of Poland; and he had made some
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogress in a negociation with the Circles of the Rhine,
for a considerable body of auxiliary troops. The Dutch
<PB N="295" REF="299"/>
had no other view but that of securing a barrier in the
Netherlands. King William insisted upon the French
King's acknowledging his title; and the English nation
wished for nothing so much as the end of a ruinous war.
On the tenth day of February, Callieres, in the name of
his master, agreed to the following preliminaries: That
the treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen should be the
basis of this negociation: that Strasbourg should be re∣stored
to the Empire, and Luxembourg to the Spaniards,
together with Mons, Charleroy, and all places taken by
the French in Catalonia since the treaty of Nimeguen:
that Dinant should be ceded to the Bishop of Liege, and
all re-unions since the treaty of Nimeguen be made void:
that the French King should make restitution of Lor∣raine;
and, upon conclusion of the peace, acknowledge
the Prince of Orange as King of Great-Britain, without
condition and reserve. The conferences were interrupted
by the death of Charles XI. King of Sweden, who was
succeeded by his son Charles, then a minor: but the
Queen and five senators, whom the late King had by will
appointed administrators of the government, resolved to
pursue the meditation, and sent a new commission to Lil∣lienroot
for that purpose. The ceremonials being regu∣lated
with the consent of all parties, the plenipotentiaries
of the Emperor delivered their master's demands to the
mediatour, on the twenty-second day of May, and seve∣ral
German ministers gave in the pretensions of the re∣spective
princes whom they represented.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. Mean while, the French King, in the hope
of procuring more favourable terms, resolved to make his
last effort against the Spaniards in Catalonia and in the
Netherlands, and to elevate the Prince of Conti to the
throne of Poland; an event which would have greatly
improved the interest of France in Europe. Louis had
got the start of the confederates in Flanders, and sent
thither a very numerous army, commanded by Catinat,
Villeroy, and Boufflers. The campaign was opened with
the siege of Aeth, which was no sooner invested, than
<PB N="296" REF="300"/>
King William, having recovered of an indisposition,
took the field, and had an interview with the Duke of
Bavaria, who commanded a separate body. He did not
think proper to interrupt the enemy in their operations
before Aeth, which surrendered in a few days after the
trenches were opened; but contented himself with taking
possession of an advantageous camp, where he covered
Brussels, which Villeroy and Boufflers had determined to
besiege. In Catalonia the Duke of Vendome invested
Barcelona, in which there was a garrison of ten thousand
regular soldiers, besides five thousand burghers, who had
voluntarily taken arms on this occasion. The governor
of the place was the Prince of Hesse d'Armstadt, who had
served in Ireland, and been vested with the command of
the Imperial troops which were sent into Spain. The
French general being re-enforced from Provence and
Languedoc, carried on his approaches with surprising
impetuosity; and was repulsed in several attacks by the
valour of the defendants. At length, the enemy sur∣prised
and routed the viceroy of Catalonia; and, flushed
with this victory, stormed the outworks, which had been
long battered with their cannon. The dispute was very
bloody and obstinate; but the French, by dint of numbers,
made themselves masters of the covered-way and two
bastions. There they erected batteries of cannon and
mortars, and fired furiously on the town, which, however,
the Prince of Hesse resolved to defend to the last extre∣mity.
The court of Madrid, however, unwilling to see
the place entirely ruined, as in all probability it would be
restored at the peace, dispatched an order to the prince to
capitulate; and he obtained very honourable terms, after
having made a glorious defence for nine weeks; in consi∣deration
of which he was appointed viceroy of the pro∣vince.
France was no sooner in possession of this im∣portant
place, than the Spaniards became as eager for
peace as they had been before averse to a negociation.</P>
<P>§ L. Their impatience was not a little inflamed by the
success of Pointis in America, where he took Carthagena,
<PB N="297" REF="301"/>
in which he found a booty amounting to eight millions of
crowns. Having ruined the fortifications of the place,
and received advice, that an English squadron under
Admiral Nevil had arrived in the West-Indies, with a
design to attack him in his return, he bore away for the
straits of Bahama. On the twenty-second day of May he
fell in with the English fleet, and one of his fly-boats was
taken; but, such was his dexterity, or good fortune,
that he escaped, after having been pursued five days, dur∣ing
which the English and Dutch rear-admirals sprang
their fore-topmasts, and received other damage, so as that
they could not proceed. Then Nevil steered to Carthagena,
which he found quite abandoned by the inhabitants, who,
after the departure of Pointis, had been rifled a second
time by the buccaneers, on pretence that they had been
defrauded of their share of the plunder. This was really
the case: they had in a great measure contributed to the
success of Pointis, and were very ill rewarded. In a few
days the English admiral discovered eight sail of their
ships, two of which were forced on shore and destroyed,
two taken, and the rest escaped. Then he directed his
course to Jamaica, and, by the advice of the governor,
Sir William Beeston, detached Rear-Admiral Meeze with
some ships and forces to attack Petit-Guavas, which he
accordingly surprised, burned, and reduced to ashes.
After this small expedition Nevil proceeded to the Ha∣vannah,
on purpose to take the galleons under his convoy
for Europe, according to the instructions he had received
from the King: but the governor of the place, and the
general of the plate-fleet, suspecting such an offer, would
neither suffer him to enter the harbour, nor put the
galleons under his protection. He now sailed through the
gulf of Florida to Virginia, where he died of chagrin, and
the command of the fleet devolved on Captain Dilkes, who
arrived in England on the twenty-fourth day of October,
with a shattered squadron, half-manned, to the unspeak∣able
mortification of the people, who slattered themselves
with the hopes of wealth and glory from this expedition.
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
Pointis steering to the banks of Newfoundland, entered
the bay of Conceptione, at a time when a stout English
squadron commanded by Commodore Norris lay at anchor
in the bay of St. John's. This officer being informed of
the arrival of a French fleet, at first concluded, that it
was the squadron of M. Nesmond come to attack him,
and exerted his utmost endeavours to put the place in a
posture of defence: but afterwards, understanding that it
was Pointis returning with the spoil of Carthagena, he
called a council of war, and proposed to go immediately
in quest of the enemy. He was, however, over-ruled by
a majority, who gave it as their opinion, that they
should remain where they were, without running unne∣cessary
hazards. By virtue of this scandalous determina∣tion,
Pointis was permitted to proceed on his voyage to
Europe; but he had not yet escaped every danger. On
the fourteenth day of August he fell in with a squadron
under the command of Captain Harlow, by whom he was
boldly engaged till night parted the combatants. He was
pursued next day; but his ships sailing better than those of
Harlow, he accomplished his escape, and on the morrow
entered the harbour of Brest. That his ships, which were
foul, should out-sail the English squadron, which had just
put to sea, was a mystery which the people of England
could not explain. They complained of having been be∣trayed
through the whole course of the West-Indian expe∣dition.
The King owned he did not understand marine
affairs, the entire conduct of which he abandoned to
Russel, who became proud, arbitrary, and unpopular, and
was supposed to be betrayed by his dependents. Certain it
is, the service was greatly obstructed by faction among the
officers, which with respect to the nation had all the ef∣fects
of treachery and misconduct.</P>
<P>§ LI. The success of the French in Catalonia, Flanders,
and the West-Indies, was balanced by their disappoint∣ment
in Poland. Louis, encouraged by the remonstrances
of the Abbé de Polignac, who managed the affairs of
France in that kingdom, resolved to support the Prince of
<PB N="299" REF="303"/>
Conti as a candidate for the crown, and remitted great
sums of money, which were distributed among the Polish
nobility. The Emperor had at first declared for the son
of the late King: but, finding the French party too strong
for this competitor, he entered into a negociation with the
Elector of Saxony, who agreed to change his religion, to
distribute eight millions of florins among the Poles, to
confirm their privileges, and advance with his troops to
the frontiers of that kingdom. Having performed these
articles, he declared himself a candidate, and was pub∣lickly
espoused by the Imperialists. The Duke of Lor∣raine,
the Prince of Baden, and Don Livio Odeschalchi,
nephew to Pope Innocent, were likewise competitors; but
finding their interest insufficient, they united their influence
with that of the Elector, who was proclaimed King of
Poland. He forthwith took the oaths required, procured
an attestation from the Imperial court of his having
changed his religion, and marched with his army to
Cracow, where he was crowned with the usual solemnity.
Louis persisted in maintaining the pretensions of the
Prince of Conti, and equipped a fleet at Dunkirk for his
convoy to Dantzick in his way to Poland. But the ma∣gistrates
of that city, who had declared for the new king,
would not suffer his men to land, though they offered to
admit himself with a small retinue. He, therefore, went
on shore at Marienburgh, where he was met by some
chiefs of his own party; but the new King Augustus
acted with such vigilance, that he found it impracticable
to form an army: besides, he suspected the sidelity of his
own Polish partisans: he, therefore, refused to part with the
treasure he had brought, and in the beginning of winter
returned to Dunkirk.</P>
<P>§ LII. The establishment of Augustus on the throne of
Poland was in some measure owing to the conduct of
Peter the Czar of Muscovy, who having formed great
designs against the Ottoman-Porte, was very unwilling to
see the crown of Poland possessed by a partisan of France,
which was in alliance with the Grand Signor. He, there∣fore,
<PB N="300" REF="304"/>
interested himself warmly in the dispute, and ordered
his general to assemble an army on the frontiers of Lithua¦nia,
which, by over-awing the Poles that were in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
interest of the Prince of Conti, considerably influenced th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
election. This extraordinary legislator, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
strange compound of heroism and barbarity, conscious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the defects in his education, and of the gross ignoranc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that overspread his dominions, resolved to extend hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ideas, and improve his judgement, by travelling; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that he might be the less restricted by forms, or inter¦rupted
by officious curiosity, he determined to travel i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
disguise. He was extremely ambitious of becoming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
maritime power, and in particular of maintaining a fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the Black-sea; and his immediate aim was to learn th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
principles of ship-building. He appointed an embassy fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Holland, to regulate some points of commerce with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
States-General. Having entrusted the care of his dom¦nions
to persons in whom he could confide, he now di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦guised
himself, and travelled as one of their retinue. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
first disclosed himself to the Elector of Brandenburgh i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prussia, and afterwards to King William, with whom h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
conferred in private at Utrecht. He engaged himself as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
common labourer with a ship-carpenter in Holland, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he served for some months with wonderful patience an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
assiduity. He afterwards visited England, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used himself chiefly with the same kind of occupatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
From thence he set out for Vienna, where receiving a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦vices
from his dominions, that his sister was concerned i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
managing intrigues against his government, he returne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
suddenly to Moscow, and found the machinations of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
conspirators were already baffled by the vigilance an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fidelity of the foreigners to whom he had left the care <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the administration. His savage nature, however, brok<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
out upon this occasion: he ordered some hundreds to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
hanged all round his capital; and a good number we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
beheaded, he himself with his own hand performing t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
office of executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="305"/>
§ LIII. The negociations at Ryswick proceeded very
slowly for some time. The Imperial ministers demanded,
that France should make restitution of all the places and
dominions she had wrested from the empire since the
peace of Munster, whether by force of arms or pretence
of right. The Spaniards claimed all they could demand
by virtue of the peace of Nimeguen and the treaty of the
Pyrannees. The French affirmed, that if the preliminaries
offered by Callieres were accepted, these propositions
could not to be taken into consideration. The Imperialists
persisted in demanding a circumstantial answer, article by
article. The Spaniards insisted upon the same manner of
proceeding, and called upon the mediator and Dutch mi∣nisters
to support their pretensions. The plenipotentia∣ries
of France declared, they would not admit any demand
or proposition, contrary to the preliminary articles: but
were willing to deliver in a project of peace, in order to
shorten the negociation; and the Spanish ambassadors
consented to this expedient. During these transactions the
Earl of Portland held a conference with Mareschal Boufflers,
near Halle, in sight of the two opposite armies, which
was continued in five successive meetings. On the second
day of August they retired together to a house in the
suburbs of Halle, and mutually signed a paper, in which the
principal articles of the peace between France and Eng∣land
were adjusted. Next day King William quitted the
camp, and retired to his house at Loo, confident of
having taken such measures for a pacification as could not
be disappointed. The subject of this field negociation is
said to have turned upon the interests of King James,
which the French monarch promised to abandon: others,
however, suppose, that the first foundation of the parti∣tion
treaty was laid in this conference. But, in all pro∣bability,
William's sole aim was to put an end to an ex∣pensive
and unsuccessful war, which had rendered him very
unpopular in his own dominions, and to obtain from the
court of France an acknowledgement of his title, which
had since the Queen's death become the subject of dis∣pute.
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
He perceived the Emperor's backwardness towards
a pacification, and foresaw numberless difficulties in dis∣cussing
such a complication of interests by the common
method of treating: he, therefore, chose such a step as he
thought would alarm the jealousy of the allies, and quicken
the negociation at Ryswick. Before the congress was
opened, King James had published two manifestoes, ad∣dressed
to the catholick and protestant princes of the con∣federacy,
representing his wrongs, and craving redress;
but his remonstrances being altogether disregarded, he
afterwards issued a third declaration, solemnly protesting
against all that might or should be negociated, regulated,
or stipulated with the usurper of his realms, as being void
of all rightful and lawful authority. On the twentieth
day of July the French ambassadors produced their pro∣ject
of a general peace, declaring at the same time, that
should it not be accepted before the last day of August,
France would not hold herself bound for the conditions
she now offered: but Caunitz, the Emperor's plenipotentia∣ry,
protested he would pay no regard to this limitation.
On the thirtieth of August, however, he delivered to the
mediatour an ultimatum, importing, That he adhered to
the treaties of Westphalia and Nimegeun, and accepted
of Strasbourg with its appurtenances: That he insisted up∣on
the restitution of Lorraine to the prince of that name;
and demanded, That the church and chapter of Liege
should be re-established in the possession of their incontes∣table
rights. Next day the French plenipotentiaries de∣clared,
That the month of August being now expired, all
their offers were vacated: That, therefore, the King of
France would reserve Strasbourg and unite it, with its de∣pendencies,
to his crown for ever: that in other respects
he would adhere to the project, and restore Barcelona to
the crown of Spain; but that these terms must be accept∣ed
in twenty days, otherwise he should think himself at
liberty to recede. The ministers of the electors and princes
of the empire joined in a written remonstrance to the
Spanish plenipotentiaries, representing the inconveniencies
<PB N="303" REF="307"/>
and dangers that would accrue to the Germanick body
from France's being in possession of Luxembourg, and ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orting
them in the strongest terms to reject all offers of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n equivalent for that province. They likewise presented
another to the States-General, requiring them to continue
the war, according to their engagements, until France
should have complied with the preliminaries. No regard,
however, was paid to either of these addresses. Then the
Imperial ambassadors demanded the good offices of the me∣diatour,
on certain articles: but all that he could obtain
of France was, that the term for adjusting the peace be∣tween
her and the Emperor should be prolonged till the
first day of November, and in the mean time an armis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice
be punctually observed. Yet even these concessions
were made, on condition that the treaty with England,
Spain, and Holland should be signed on that day,
even though the Emperor and empire should not con∣cur.</P>
<P>§ LIV. Accordingly, on the twentieth day of Septem∣ber,
the articles were subscribed by the Dutch, English,
Spanish, and French ambassadors, while the Imperial
ministers protested against the transaction, observing, this
was the second time that a separate peace had been con∣cluded
with France; and that the states of the empire,
who had been imposed upon through their own credulity,
would not for the future be so easily persuaded to engage
in confederacies. In certain preparatory articles settled be∣tween
England and France, King William promised to
pay a yearly pension to Queen Mary D'Este, of fifty thou∣sand
pounds, or such sum as should be established for
that purpose by act of parliament. The treaty itself consist∣ed
of seventeen articles. The French King engaged,
that he would not disturb or disquiet the King of Great
Britain in the possession of his realms or government: nor
assist his enemies, nor favour conspiracies against his per∣son.
This obligation was reciprocal. A free commerce was
restored. Commissaries were appointed to meet at Lon∣don,
<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
and settle the pretensions of each crown to Hudson's
Bay, taken by the French during the late peace, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
retaken by the English in the course of the war; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
regulate the limits of the places to be restored, as well a
the exchanges to be made. It was likewise stipulated
That, in case of a rupture, six months should be allowe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the sujects of each power for removing their effects▪
That the separate article of the treaty of Nimeguen, re¦lating
to the principality of Orange, should be entirely
executed; and, That the ratifications should be exchange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in three weeks from the day of signing. The treaty be¦tween
France and Holland imported a general armistice, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
perpetual amity, a mutual restitution, a reciprocal renun∣ciation
of all pretensions upon each other, a confirmation
of the peace with Savoy, a re-establishment of the treaty
concluded between France and Brandenburgh, in the yea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one thousand six hundred and seventy-nine, a comprehen∣sion
of Sweden, and all those powers that should be named
before the ratification, or in six months after the conclu∣sion
of the treaty. Besides the Dutch minister conclu∣ded
a treaty of commerce with France, which was imme∣diately
put in execution. Spain had great reason to be
satisfied with the pacification, by which she recovered
Gironne, Rose▪s, Barcelona, Luxembourg, Charleroy,
Mons, Courtray, and all the towns, fortresses, and ter∣ritories
taken by the French in the province of Luxem∣bourg,
Namur, Brabant, Flanders, and Hainault, except
eighty-two towns and villages claimed by the French: this
dispute was left to the decision of commissaries; or, in
case they should not agree, to the determination of the
States-General. A remonstrance in favour of the French
protestant refugees in England, Holland, and Germany,
was delivered by the Earl of Pembroke to the mediator, in
the name of the protestant allies, on the day that preceded
the conclusion of the treaty; but the French plenip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten∣tiaries
declared, in the name of their master, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he
did not pretend to prescribe rules to King William
<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
about the English subjects, he expected the same liberty
with respect to his own. No other effort was made
in behalf of those conscientious exiles: the treaties were
ratified, and the peace proclaimed at Paris and London.</P>
<P>§ LV. The Emperor still held out, and perhaps was
encouraged to persevere in his obstinacy by the success of
his arms in Hungary, where his general, Prince Eugene
of Savoy, obtained a complete victory at Zenta over the
forces of the Grand Signor, who commanded his army
in person. In this battle, which was fought on the
eleventh day of September, the Grand Visir, the Agra of
the Janissaries, seven-and-twenty bashaws, and about
thirty thousand men, were killed or drowned in the river
Theysse: six thousand were wounded or taken, together
with all their artillery, tents, baggage, provision, and am∣munition,
the Grand Signor himself escaping with diffi∣culty:
a victory the more glorious and acceptable, as the
Turks had a great superiority in point of number, and as
the Imperialists did not lose a thousand men during the
whole action. The Emperor perceiving that the event of
this battle had no effect in retarding the treaty, thought
proper to make use of the armistice, and continue the ne∣gociation
after the forementioned treaties had been signed.
This was likewise the case with the princes of the empire;
though those of the protestant persuasion complained, that
their interest was neglected. In one of the articles of the
treaty, it was stipulated, that in the places to be restored
by France, the Roman catholick religion should continue
as it had been re-established. The ambassadors of the
protestant princes joined in a remonstrance, demanding,
That the Lutheran religion should be restored in those
places where it had formerly prevailed; but this demand
was rejected, as being equally disagreeable to France and
the Emperor. Then they refused to sign the treaty, which
was now concluded between France, the Emperor, and
the catholick princes of the empire. By this pacification,
Triers, the Palatinate, and Lorraine, were restored to their
respective owners. The countries of Spanheim and Vel∣dentz,
together with the duchy of Deux Ponts, were
<PB N="306" REF="310"/>
ceded to the King of Sweden. Francis Louis Palatine
was confirmed in the Electorate of Cologn; and Cardinal
Furstemberg restored to all his rights and benefices. The
claims of the Duchess of Orleans upon the Palatinate were
referred to the arbitration of France and the Emperor;
and in the mean time the Elector Palatine agreed to supply
her highness with an annuity of one hundred thousand
florins. The ministers of the protestant princes published
a formal declaration against the clause relating to religion,
and afterwards solemnly protested against the manner in
which the negociation had been conducted. Such was the
issue of a long and bloody war, which had drained England
of her wealth and people, almost entirely ruined her com∣merce,
debauched her morals, by encouraging venality and
corruption, and entailed upon her the curse of foreign con∣nexions,
as well as a national debt, which was gradually
increased to an intolerable burthen. After all the blood
and treasure which had been expended, William's am∣bition
and revenge remained unsatisfied. Nevertheless,
he reaped the solid advantage of seeing himself firmly esta∣blished
on the English throne; and the confederacy,
though not successful in every instance, accomplished
their great aim of putting a stop to the encroachments of
the French monarch. They mortified his vanity, they
humbled his pride and arrogance, and compelled him to
disgorge the acquisitions which, like a robber, he had made
in violation of publick faith, justice, and humanity. Had
the allies been true to one another; had they acted from
genuine zeal for the common interests of mankind; and
prosecuted with vigour the plan which was originally con∣certed,
Louis would in a few campaigns have been re∣duced
to the most abject state of disgrace, despondence,
and submission; for he was destitute of true courage and
magnanimity. King William having finished this im∣portant
transaction, returned to England about the middle
of November, and was received in London, amidst the
acclamations of the people, who now again hailed him
as their deliverer from a war, by the continuance of
which they must have been infallibly beggared.</P>

§ I. WHEN the King opened the session of parlia∣ment
on the third day of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1695.</NOTE> he told
them the war was brought to the end they all proposed,
namely, an honourable peace. He gave them to under∣stand
there was a considerable debt on account of the
fleet and army: that the revenues of the crown had been
anticipated: he expressed his hope, that they would pro∣vide
for him during his life, in such a manner as would
conduce to his own honour, and that of the government.
He recommended the maintenance of a considerable navy;
and gave it as his opinion, that for the present England
could not be safe without a standing army. He promised
to rectify such corruptions and abuses as might have crept
into any part of the administration during the war; and
effectually to discourage prophaneness and immorality.
Finally, he assured them, that as he had rescued their re∣ligion,
laws, and liberties, when they were in the extremest
danger, so he should place the glory of his reign in pre∣serving
and leaving them entire to latest posterity. To
this speech the Commons replied in an address, by a com∣pliment
of congratulation upon the peace, and an assurance,
that they would be ever ready to assist and support his
Majesty, who had confirmed them in the quiet possession
of their rights and liberties, and by putting an end to the
war fully completed the work of their deliverance. Not∣withstanding
these appearances of good-humour, the ma∣jority
of the House, and indeed of the whole nation, were
equally alarmed and exasperated at a project for maintain∣ing
a standing army, which was countenanced at court,
and even recommended by the King, in his speech to the
parliament. William's genius was altogether military. He
could not bear the thoughts of being a king without power.
He could not without reluctance dismiss those officers who
had given so many proofs of their courage and fidelity.
He did not think himself safe upon the naked throne, in a
<PB N="310" REF="314"/>
kingdom that swarmed with malcontents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1697.</NOTE> who had so often
conspired against his person and government. He dreaded
the ambition and known perfidy of the French King, who
still retained a powerful army. He foresaw that a reduction
of the forces would lessen his importance both at home and
abroad; diminish the dependence upon his government; and
disperse those foreigners in whose attachment he chiefly
confided. He communicated his sentiments on this subject
to his confident, the Earl of Sunderland, who knew by
experience the aversion of the people to a standing army;
nevertheless, encouraged him with hope of success, on the
supposition that the Commons would see the difference
between an army raised by the King's private authority,
and a body of veteran troops maintained by consent of
parliament for the Security of the kingdom. This was a
distinction to which the people paid no regard. All the
jealousy of former parliaments seemed to be roused by the
bare proposal; and this was inflamed by a national pre∣judice
against the refugees, in whose favour the King had
betrayed repeated marks of partial indulgence. They
were submissive, tractable, and wholly dependent upon his
will and generosity. The Jacobites failed not to cherish
the seeds of dissatisfaction, and reproach the Whigs who
countenanced this measure. They branded that party
with apostacy from their former principles. They ob∣served,
that the very persons who in the late reigns en∣deavoured
to abridge the prerogative, and deprive the
King of that share of power which was absolutely neces∣sary
to actuate the machine of government, were now be∣come
advocates for maintaining a standing army in time
of peace; nay, and impudently avowed, that their com∣plaisance
to the court in this particular was owing to
their desire of excluding from all share in the administration
a faction disaffected to his Majesty, which might mislead
him into more pernicious measures. The majority of
those who really entertained Revolution principles opposed
the court, from apprehensions that a standing army once
established would take root, and grow into an habitual
maxim of government: that, should the people be disarmed,
<PB N="311" REF="315"/>
and the sword left in the hands of mercenaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1697.</NOTE> the liber∣ties
of the nation must be entirely at the mercy of him by
whom those mercenaries should be commanded. They
might over-awe elections, dictate to parliaments, and esta∣blish
a tyranny, before the people could take any measures
for their own protection. They could not help thinking
it was possible to form a militia, that with the concurrence
of a fleet might effectually protect the kingdom from the
dangers of an invasion. They firmly believed, that a
militia might be regularly trained to arms, so as to acquire
the dexterity of professed soldiers; and they did not doubt
they would surpass those hirelings in courage, considering
that they would be animated by every concurring motive
of interest, sentiment, and affection. Nay, they argued,
that Britain, surrounded as it was by a boisterous sea, se∣cured
by floating bulwarks, abounding with stout and
hardy inhabitants, did not deserve to be free, if her sons
could not protect their liberties without the assistance of
mercenaries, who were indeed the only slaves of the king∣dom.
Yet, among the genuine friends of their country,
some individuals espoused the opposite maxims. They
observed that the military system of every government in
Europe was now altered: that war was become a trade,
and discipline a science not to be learned but by those who
made it their sole profession: that, therefore, while
France kept up a large standing army of veterans, ready
to embark on the opposite coast, it would be absolutely
necessary, for the safety of the nation, to maintain a small
standing force, which would be voted in parliament from
year to year. They might have suggested another expe∣dient,
which in a few years would have produced a mi∣litia
of disciplined men. Had the soldiers of this small
standing army been inlisted for a term of years, at the expi∣ration
of which they might have claimed their discharge,
volunteers would have offered themselves from all parts of
the kingdom, even from the desire of learning the use and
exercise of arms, the ambition of being concerned in
scenes of actual service, and the chagrin of little disap∣pointments
<PB N="312" REF="316"/>
or temporary disgusts, which yet would not
have impelled them to inlist as soldiers on the common
terms of perpetual slavery. In consequence of such a suc∣cession,
the whole kingdom would soon have been stocked
with members of a disciplined militia, equal, if not superior
to any army of professed soldiers. But this scheme would
have defeated the purpose of the government, which was
more afraid of domestick foes than of foreign enemies;
and industriously avoided every plan of this nature, which
could contribute to render the malcontents of the nation
more formidable.</P>
<P>§ II. Before we proceed to the transactions of parliament
in this session, it may not be amiss to sketch the out-lines
of the ministry, as it stood at this juncture. The King's
affection for the Earl of Portland had begun to abate, in
proportion as his esteem for Sunderland increased, together
with his consideration for Mrs. Villiers, who had been distin∣guished
by some particular marks of his Majesty's favour.
These two favourites are said to have supplanted Portland,
whose place in the King's bosom was now filled by Van Kep∣pel,
a gentleman of Guelderland, who had first served his
Majesty as a page, and afterwards acted as a private secretary.
The Earl of Portland growing troublesome, from his jea∣lousy
of this rival, the King resolved to send him into ho∣nourable
exile, in quality of an ambassador extraordinary
to the court of France; and Trumball, his friend and crea∣ture,
was dismissed from the office of secretary, which the
King conferred upon Vernon, a plodding man of business,
who had acted as under secretary to the Duke of Shrews∣bury.
This nobleman rivalled the Earl of Sunderland in
his credit at the council board, and was supported by
Somers, Lord-Chancellor of England, by Russel, now
Earl of Orford, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Montagu,
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Somers was an upright
judge, a plausible statesman, a consummate courtier, affable,
mild, and insinuating. Orford appears to have been
rough, turbulent, factious, and shallow. Montagu had
distinguished himself early by his poetical genius; but he
<PB N="313" REF="317"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on converted his attention to the cultivation of more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olid talents. He rendered himself remarkable for his elo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence,
discernment, and knowledge of the English con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itution.
To a delicate taste, he united an eager appetite
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or political studies. The first catered for the enjoyments
of fancy: the other was subservient to his ambition. He,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the same time, was the distinguished encourager of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberal arts, and the professed patron of projectors. In his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivate deportment he was liberal, easy, and entertaining:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a statesman, bold, dogmatical, and aspiring.</P>
<P>§ III. The terrours of a standing army had produced
such an universal ferment in the nation, that the depen∣dents
of the court in the House of Commons durst not openly
oppose the reduction of the forces: but they shifted the
battery, and employed all their address in persuading the
House to agree, that a very small number should be retain∣ed.
When the Commons voted, That all the forces
raised since the year one thousand six hundred and eighty
should be disbanded, the courtiers desired the vote
might be recommitted, on pretence that it restrained the
King to the old Tory regiments, on whose fidelity he
could not rely. This motion, however, was over-ruled
by a considerable majority. Then they proposed an amend∣ment,
which was rejected, and afterwards moved, That
the sum of five hundred thousand pounds per annum should
be granted for the maintenance of guards and garrisons.
This provision would have maintained a very considerable
number; but they were again disappointed, and fain to
embrace a composition with the other party, by which
three hundred and fifty thousand pounds were allotted for
the maintenance of ten thousand men; and they after∣wards
obtained an addition of three thousand marines. The
King was extremely mortified at these resolutions of the
Commons; and even declared to his particular friends,
that he would never have intermeddled with the affairs of
the nation, had he foreseen they would make such returns
of ingratitude and distrust. His displeasure was aggra∣vated
by the resentment expressed against Sunderland, who
<PB N="314" REF="318"/>
was supposed to have advised the unpopular measure of
retaining a standing army. This nobleman, dreading the
vengeance of the Commons, resolved to avert the fury of
the impending storm, by resigning his office, and retiring
from court, contrary to the intreaties of his friends, and
the earnest desire of his Majesty.</P>
<P>§ IV. The House of Commons, in order to sweeten
the unpalatable cup they had presented to the King, voted
the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds per annum for
the support of the civil list, distinct from all other services.
Then they passed an act prohibiting the currency of silvered
hammered coin, including a clause for making out new
Exchequer bills, in lieu of those which were or might be
filled up with endorsements: they framed another to open
the corespondence with France, under variety of provisos:
a third for continuing the imprisonment of certain persons
who had been concerned in the late conspiracy: a fourth
granting further time for administering oaths with respect
to tallies and orders in the Exchequer and Bank of Eng∣land.
These bills having received the royal assent, they
resolved to grant a supply, which, together with the funds
already settled for that purpose, should be sufficient to
answer and cancel all Exchequer bills, to the amount of
two millions seven hundred thousand pounds. Another
supply was voted for the payment and reduction of the
army, including half-pay to such commission officers as
were natural-born subjects of England. They granted
one million four hundred thousand pounds, to make good
deficiencies. They resolved, That the sum of two millions
three hundred and forty-eight thousand one hundred and
two pounds was necessary to pay off arrears, subsistence, con∣tingencies,
general-officers, guards, and garrisons, of which
sum eight hundred and fifty-five thousand five hundred
and two pounds remained in the hands of the paymaster.
Then they took into consideration the subsidies due to
foreign powers, and the sums owing to contractors
for bread and forage. Examining further the debts of the
nation, they found the general debt of the navy amounted
<PB N="315" REF="319"/>
to one million three hundred and ninety two thousand, se∣ven
hundred and forty-two pounds. That of the Ordnance
was equal to two hundred and four thousand, one hundred
and fifty-seven pounds. The transport debt contracted
for the reduction of Ireland, and other services, did not fall
short of four hundred and sixty-six thousand, four hundred
and ninety-three pounds; and they owed nine-and-forty
thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine pounds, for
quartering and clothing the army, which had been raised
by one act of parliament in the year 1677, and disbanded
by another in the year 1679. As this enormous load of
debt could not be discharged at once, the Commons passed
a number of votes for raising sums of money, by which it
was considerably lightened; and settled the funds for
those purposes by the continuation of the land-tax and
other impositions. With respect to the civil list, it was
raised by a new subsidy of tonnage and poundage, the he∣reditary,
and temporary excise, a weekly portion from the
revenue of the post-office, the first-fruits and tenths of
the clergy, the fines in the alienation-office, and post-fines,
the revenue of the wine-license, money arising by sheriffs,
prossers, and compositions in the Exchequer, and seisures,
the income of the Duchy of Cornwall, the rents of all other
crown-lands in England or Wales, and the duty of four
and a half per cent. upon specie from Barbadoes and the
Leeward-islands. The bill imported, that the overplus
arising from these funds should be accounted for to parlia∣ment.
Six hundred thousand pounds of this money was
allotted for the purposes of the civil list: the rest was grant∣ed
for the jointure of fifty thousand pounds per annum, to
be paid to Queen Mary of Este, according to the stipulation
at Ryswick; and to maintain a court for the Duke of
Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, now
in the ninth year of his age: but the jointure was never
paid; nor would the King allow above fifteen thousand
pounds per annum for the use of the Duke of Gloucester,
to whom Burnet Bishop of Salisbury was appointed pre∣ceptor.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="320"/>
§ V. The Commons having discussed the ways and
means for raising the supplies for the ensuing year, which
rose almost to five millions, took cognizance of some
fraudulent endorsements of Exchequer-bills, a species of
forgery which had been practised by a confederacy, con∣sisting
of Charles Duncomb, receiver-general of the Ex∣cise,
Bartholomew Burton, who possessed a place in that
branch of the revenue, John Knight, treasurer of the
Customs, and Reginald Marriot, a deputy-teller of the
Exchequer. This last became evidence, and the proof
turning out very strong and full, the House resolved to
make examples of the delinquents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. State Tracts Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> Duncomb and
Knight, both members of parliament, were expelled, and
committed to the Tower: Burton was sent to Newgate;
and bills of pain and penalties were ordered to be brought
against them. The first, levelled at Duncomb, passed the
Lower-House, though not without great opposition: but
was rejected in the House of Lords by the majority of one
voice. Duncomb, who was extremely rich, is said to
have paid dear for his escape. The other two bills met
with the same fate. The Peers discharged Duncomb
from his confinement; but he was re-committed by the
Commons, and remained in custody till the end of the
session. While the Commons were employed on ways
and means, some of the members in the opposition pro∣posed,
that one-fourth part of the money arising from
improper grants of the crown should be appropriated to
the service of the publick, but this was a very unpalatable
expedient, as it affected not only the Whigs of King
William's reign, but also the Tories who had been grati∣fied
by Charles II. and his brother. A great number of
petitions were presented against this measure, and so many
difficulties raised, that both parties agreed to lay it aside.
In the course of this enquiry, they discovered that one
Railton held a grant in trust for Mr. Montagu, Chan∣tellor
of the Exchequer. A motion was immediately
made, that he should withdraw; but passed in the negative
by a great majority. Far from prosecuring this minister,
<PB N="317" REF="321"/>
the House voted it was their opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. Ann. 1698.</NOTE> that Mr. Montagu,
for his good services to the government, did deserve his
Majesty's favour.</P>
<P>§ VI. This extraordinary vote was sure presage of
success in the execution of a scheme which Montagu had
concerted against the East-India company. They had been
sounded about advancing a sum of money for the publick
service, by way of loan, in consideration of a parliamenta∣ry
settlement; and they offered to raise seven hundred
thousand pounds on that condition: but, before they
formed this resolution, another body of merchants, under
the auspices of Montagu, offered to lend two millions at
eight per cent. provided they might be gratified with an
exclusive privilege of trading to the East-Indies. This
proposal was very well received by the majority in the
House of Commons. A bill for this purpose was brought
in, with additional clauses of regulation. A petition was
presented by the old company, representing their rights
and claims under so many royal charters; the regard due
to the property of above a thousand families interested in
the stock: as also to the company's property in India,
amounting to forty-four thousand pounds of yearly revenue.
They alledged they had expended a million in fortifications,
that during the war they had lost twelve great ships, worth
fifteen hundred thousand pounds: that since the last sub∣scription
they had contributed two hundred and ninety∣five
thousand pounds to the Customs, with above eighty-five
thousand pounds in taxes: that they had furnished
six thousand barrels of gunpowder on a very pressing oc∣casion;
and eighty thousand pounds for the circulation
of Exchequer bills, at a very critical juncture, by desire of
the Lords of the Treasury, who owned that their com∣pliance
was a very important service to the government.
No regard being paid to their remonstrance, they under∣took
to raise the loan of two millions, and immediately
subscribed two hundred thousand pounds as the first pay∣ment.
The two proposals being compared and considered
by the House, the majority declared for the bill, which
<PB N="318" REF="322"/>
was passed, and sent up to the House of Lords. There
the old company delivered another petition, and was heard
by counsel; nevertheless the bill made its way, though
not without opposition, and a formal protestation by one-and-twenty
lords, who thought it was a hardship upon
the present company; and doubted whether the separate
trade allowed in the bill, concurrent with a joint-stock,
might not prove such an inconsistency as would discourage
the subscription. This act, by which the whole company
was dissolved, in a great measure blasted the reputation
of the Whigs, which had for some time been in the de∣cline
with the people. They had stood up as advocates for
a standing army: they now unjustly superseded the East-India
company; they were accused of having robbed the
publick by embezzling the national treasure, and amassing
wealth by usurious contracts, at the expense of their fel∣low-subjects
groaning under the most oppressive burthens.
Certain it is, they were at this period the most mercena∣ry
and corrupt undertakers that ever had been employed
by any king or administration since the first establishment
of the English monarchy.</P>
<P>§ VII. The Commons now transferred their attention
to certain objects in which the people of Ireland were in∣terested.
Colonel Mitchelborne, who had been joint go∣vernour
of Londonderry with Doctor Walker, during the
siege of that place, petitioned the House in behalf of him∣self,
his officers, and soldiers, to whom a considerable sum
of mony was due for subsistence; and the city itself im∣plored
the mediation of the Commons with his Majesty,
that its services and sufferings might be taken into con∣sideration.
The House having examined the allegations
contained in both petitions, presented an address to the
King, recommending the citizens of Londonderry to his
Majesty's favour, that they might no longer remain a rui∣nous
spectacle to all, a scorn to their enemies, and a dis∣couragement
to well-affected subjects; they likewise de∣clared,
that the governour and garrison did deserve some
special marks of royal favour, for a lasting monument to
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>
posterity. To this address the King replied, that he would
consider them, according to the desire of the Commons.
William Molineux, a gentleman of Dublin, having pub∣lished
a book to prove that the kingdom of Ireland was
independent of the parliament of England, the House ap∣pointed
a committee to enquire into the cause and na∣ture
of this performance. An address was voted to the
King, desiring he would give directions for the discovery
and punishment of the author. Upon the report of the
committee, the Commons in a body presented an address
to his Majesty, representing the dangerous attempts which
had been lately made by some of his subjects in Ireland,
to shake off their subjection and dependence upon Eng∣land;
attempts which appeared not only from the bold
and pernicious assertions contained in a book lately pub∣lished,
but more fully and authentically by some votes
and proceedings of the Commons in Ireland. These had,
during their last session, transmitted an act for the better
security of his Majesty's person and government, whereby
an English act of parliament was pretended to be re-en∣acted,
with alterations obligatory on the courts of justice
and the great seal of England. The English Commons,
therefore, besought his Majesty to give effectual orders
for preventing any such encroachments for the future,
and the pernicious consequences of what was past, by pu∣nishing
those who had been guilty thereof: that he would
take care to see the laws which direct and restrain the
parliament of Ireland punctually observed, and discourage
every thing which might have a tendency to lessen the
dependence of Ireland upon England. This remonstrance
was graciously received, and the King promised to comply
with their request.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The jealousy which the Commons entertained
of the government in Ireland animated them to take
other measures, that ascertained the subjection of that
kingdom. Understanding that the Irish had established
divers woollen manufactures, they, in another address,
intreated his Majesty to take measures for discouraging the
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>
woollen manufactures in Ireland, as they interfered with those of England, and promote the linen manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which would be profitable to both nations. At the same
time, receiving information that the French had seduced
some English manufacturers, and set up a great work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cloth-making in Picardy, they brought in a bill for ex∣plaining
and better executing former acts for preventing
the exportation of wool, fullers-earth, and scouring clay
and this was immediately passed into a law. A petitio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being presented to the House, by the lustring company
against certain merchants who had smuggled alamodes and
lustrings from France, even during the war, the commit∣tee
of trade was directed to enquire into the allegations
and all the secrets of this traffick were detected. Upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
report, the House resolved that the manufacture of ala∣modes
and lustrings set up in England had been beneficia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the kingdom: that there had been a destructive and
illegal trade carried on during the war, for importing these
commodities, by which the King had been defrauded o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his customs, and the English manufactures greatly dis∣couraged;
that by the smuggling vessels employed in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
trade, intelligence had been carried into France du∣ring
the war, and the enemies of the government con∣veyed
from justice. Stephen Seignoret Rhené Baudoin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
John Goudet, Nicholas Santini, Peter de Hearse, Joh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Pierce, John Dumaitre, and David Barreau were impeached
at the bar of the House of Lords; and pleading guilty
the Lords imposed sines upon them, according to their re∣spective
circumstances. They were in the mean time
committed to Newgate, until those fines should be paid
and the Commons addressed the King, that the money
might be appropriated to the maintenance of Greenwich
hospital. The House having taken cognizance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
affair, and made some new regulations in the prosecutio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the African trade, presented a solemn address to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King, representing the general degeneracy and corruptio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the age, and beseeching his Majesty to command a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his judges, justices, and magistrates, to put the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="321" REF="325"/>
execution against profaneness and immorality. The King
professed himself extremely well pleased with this remon∣strance,
promised to give immediate directions for a refor∣mation,
and expressed his desire that some more effectual
provision might be made for suppressing impious books,
containing doctrines against the Trinity; doctrines which
abounded at this period, and took their origin from the
license and profligacy of the times.</P>
<P>§ IX. In the midst of such immorality, Dr. Thomas
Bray, and active divine, formed a plan for propagating the
gospel in foreign countries. Missionaries, catechisms,
liturgies, and other books for the instruction of ignorant
people, were se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the English colonies in America.
This laudable design was supported by voluntary contri∣bution;
and the bill having been brought into the House
of Commons, for the better discovery of estates given to
superstitious uses, Dr. Bray presented a petition, praying,
that some part of these estates might be set apart for the
propagation of the reformed religion in Maryland, Vir∣ginia,
and the Leeward iflands. About this period, a
society for the reformation of manners was formed under
the King's countenance and encouragement. Considerable
collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read
prayers at certain hours in places of publick worship, and
administer the sacrament every Sunday. The members of
this society resolved to inform the magistrates of all vice
and immorality that should fall under their cognizance;
and with that part of the sines allowed by law to the in∣former
constitute a fund of charity. The business of the
session being terminated, the King, on the third day of
July, prorogued the parliament, after having thanked
them, in a short speech, for the many testimonies of their
affection he had received: and in two days after the pro∣rogation
it was dissolved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the fifth day of January, a fire breaking out at Whitehall, through the carelessness of a laundress, the whole body of the palace, together with the new gallery, councll-chamber, and several adjoining apartments, was entirely consumed; but the banqueting-house was not affected.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ X. In the month of January, the Earl of Portland
had set out on his embassy to France, where he was re∣ceived
<PB N="322" REF="326"/>
with very particular marks of distinction. He made
a publick entry into Paris with such magnificence as is
said to have astonished the French nation. He interceded
for the protestants in that kingdom, against whom the
persecution had been renewed with redoubled violence:
he proposed that King James should be removed to
Avignon, in which case his master would supply him with
an honourable pension: but his remonstrances on both
subjects proved ineffectual. Louis, however, in a private
conference with him at Marli, is supposed to have com∣municated
his project of the partition-treaty. The Earl
of Portland, at his return to England, finding himself
totally eclipsed in the King's favour, by Keppel, now
created Earl of Albemarle, resigned his employments in
disgust; nor could the King's sollicitations prevail upon
him to resume any office in the household; though he
promised to serve his Majesty in any other shape, and was
soon employed to negociate the treaty of partition. If
this nobleman miscarried in the purposes of his last embassy
at the court of Versailles, the agents of France were
equally unsuccessful in their endeavours to retrieve their
commerce with England, which the war had interrupted.
Their commissary, sent over to London with powers to
regulate the trade between the two nations, met with in∣superable
difficulties. The parliament had burthened the
French commodities with heavy duties, which were already
appropriated to different uses; and the channel of trade was
in many respects entirely altered. The English merchants
supplied the nation with wines from Italy, Spain, and Por∣tugal;
with linen from Holland and Silesia; and manufac∣tures
of paper, hats, stuffs, and silks, had been set up and suc∣cessfully
carried on in England, by the French refugees.</P>
<P>§ XI. By this time a ferment had been raised in Scot∣land,
by the opposition and discouragements their new
company had sustained. They had employed agents in
England, Holland, and Hamburgh, to receive subscrip∣tions.
The adventurers in England were intimidated by
the measures which had been taken in parliament against
<PB N="323" REF="327"/>
the Scottish company. The Dutch East-India company
took the alarm, and exerted all their interest to prevent their
countrymen from subscribing; and the King permitted
his resident at Hamburgh to present a memorial against
the Scottish company to the senate of that city. The
parliament of Scotland being assembled by the Earl of
Marchmont as King's commissioner, the company pre∣sented
it with a remonstrance, containing a detail of their
grievances, arising from the conduct of the English House
of Commons, as well as from the memorial presented by
the King's minister at Hamburgh, in which he actually
disowned the act of parliament and letters-patent which
had passed in their favour, and threatened the inhabitants
of that city with his Majesty's resentment, in case they
should join the Scots in their undertaking. They repre∣sented,
that such instances of interposition had put a stop
to the subscriptions in England and Hamburgh, hurt the
credit of the company, discouraged the adventurers, and
threatened the entire ruin of a design in which all the most
considerable families of the nation were deeply engaged.
The parliament having taken their case into consideration,
sent an address to his Majesty, representing the hardships
to which the company had been exposed, explaining how
far the nation in general was concerned in the design, and
intreating that he would take such measures as might
effectually vindicate the undoubted rights and privileges of
the company. This address was seconded by a petition
from the company itself, praying, that his Majesty would
give some intimation to the senate of Hamburgh, per∣mitting
the inhabitants of that city to renew the sub∣scriptions
they had withdrawn: that, as a gracious mark
of his royal favour to the company, he would bestow upon
them two smal frigates, then lying useless in the harbour
of Burnt-Island; and that, in consideration of the
obstructions they had encountered, he would continue
their privileges and immunities for such longer time as
should seem reasonable to his Majesty. Though the com∣missioner
was wholly devoted to the King, who had
<PB N="324" REF="328"/>
actually resolved to ruin this company, he could not ap∣pease
the resentment of the nation; and the heats in par∣liament
became so violent, that he was obliged to adjourn
it to the fifth day of November. In this interval, the
directors of the company, understanding from their agent
at Hamburgh that the address of the parliament, and
their own petition, had produced no effect in their favour;
they wrote a letter of complaint to the Lord Seafield, se∣cretary
of state, observing, that they had received re∣peated
assurances of the King's having given orders to his
resident at Hamburgh touching their memorial; and in∣treating
the interposition of his lordship, that justice might
be done to the company. The secretary, in his answer,
promised to take the first convenient opportunity of repre∣senting
the affair to his Majesty; but he said this could not
be immediately expected, as the King was much engaged
in the affairs of the English parliament. This declaration
the directors considered, as it really was, a mere evasion,
which helped to alienate the minds of that people from
the King's person and government.</P>
<P>§ XII. King William at this time revolved in his own
mind a project of far greater consequence to the interest of
Europe; namely, that of settling the succession to the
throne of Spain, which in a little time would be vacated
by the death of Charles II. whose constitution was already
exhausted. He had been lately reduced to extremity, and
his situation was no sooner known in France, than Louis
detached a squadron towards Cadix, with orders to inter∣cept
the plate-sleet, in case the King of Spain should die
before its arrival. William sent another fleet to protect
the galleons; but it arrived too late for that service, and
the nation londly exclaimed against the tardiness of the
equipment. His Catholick Majesty recovered from his
disorder, contrary to the expectation of his people; but
continued in such an enfeebled and precarious state of
health, that a relapse was every moment apprehended. In
the latter end of July King William embarked for Hol∣land,
on pretence of enjoying a recess from business,
<PB N="325" REF="329"/>
which was necessary to his constitution. He was glad of
an opportunity to withdraw himself for some time from
a kingdom in which he had been exposed to such opposi∣tion
and chagrin. But the real motive of his voyage, was
a design of treating with the French King, remote from
the observation of those who might have penetrated into
the nature of his negociation. He had appointed a regency
to govern the kingdom in his absence, and as one of the
number nominated the Earl of Marlborough, who had
regained his favour, and been constituted governor to the
Duke of Gloucester. At his Majesty's departure, sealed
orders were left with the ministry, directing, that sixteen
thousand men should be retained in the service, notwith∣standing
the vote of the Commons, by which the stand∣ing
army was limited to ten thousand. He alledged, that
the apprehension of troubles which might arise at the
death of King Charles induced him to transgress this limi∣tation:
and he hoped that the new parliament would be
more favourable. His enemies, however, made a fresh
handle of this step, to depreciate his character in the
eyes of the people.</P>
<P>§ XIII. Having assisted at the assembly of the States-General,
and given audience to divers ambassadours at the
Hague, he repaired to his House at Loo, attended by the
Earls of Essex, Portland, and Selkirk. There he was vi∣sited
by Count Tallard, the French minister, who had
instructions to negociate the treaty concerning the Spa∣nish
succession. The Earl of Portland, by his Majesty's or∣der,
had communicated to Secretary Vernon the principal
conditions which the French King proposed: he himself
wrote a letter to Lord Chancellor Somers, desiring his ad∣vice
with regard to the propositions, and full powers under
the great seal, with blanks to be filled up occasionally, that
he might immediately begin the treaty with Count Tal∣lard.
At the same time, he strictly enjoined secresy. The
purport of Portland's letter was imparted to the Duke of
Shrewsbury and Mr. Montagu, who consulted with the
Chancellor and Vernon upon the subject; and the Chan∣cellor
wrote an answer to the King, as the issue of their
<PB N="326" REF="330"/>
joint deliberation: but, before it reached his Majesty, the
first treaty of partition was signed by the Earl of Portland
and Sir Joseph Williamson. The contracting powers
agreed, That, in case the King of Spain should die with∣out
issue, the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, with the
places depending on the Spanish monarchy, and situated
on the coast of Tuscany, or the adjacent islands, the mar∣quisate
of Final, the province of Guipuscoa; all places on
the French side of the Pyrannees, or the other mountains
of Navarre, Alva, or Biscay, on the other side of the pro∣vince
of Guipuscoa, with all the ships, vessels, and stores,
should devolve upon the Dauphin, in consideration of his
right to the crown of Spain, which, with all its other de∣pendencies,
should descend to the Electoral Prince of
Bavaria, under the guardianship of his father: That the
duchy of Milan should be settled on the Emperor's second
son, the Archduke Charles: That this treaty should be
communicated to the Emperor and the Elector of Bavaria
by the King of England and the States-General: That
if either should refuse to agree to this partition, his pro∣portion
should remain in sequestration, until the dispute
could be accommodated: That in case the Electoral Prince
of Bavaira should die before his father, then the Elector
and his other heirs should succeed him in those domi∣nions;
and, should the Archduke reject the duchy of
Milan, they agreed that it should be sequestered and govern∣ed
by the Prince of Vaudemont. It may be necessary to ob∣serve,
that Philip IV. father to the present King of Spain,
had settled his crown by will on the Emperor's children;
that the Dauphin was son to Maria-Theresa, daughter of
the same monarch, whose right to the succession Louis had
renounced in the most solemn manner: as for the Electoral
Prince of Bavaria, he was grandson to a daughter of Spain.
This treaty of partition was one of the most impudent
schemes of encroachment that tyranny and injustice ever
planned. Louis, who had made a practice of sacrificing
all ties of honour and good faith to the interest of his
pride, vanity, and ambition, foresaw that he should never
<PB N="327" REF="331"/>
be able to accomplish his designs upon the crown of Spain,
while William was left at liberty to form another confe∣deracy
against them. He, therefore, resolved to amuse him
with a treaty, in which he should seem to act as umpire
in the concerns of Europe. He knew that William was too
much of a politician to be restricted by notions of private
justice; and that he would make no scruple to infringe
the laws of particular countries, or even the rights of a
single nation, when the balance of power was at stake.
He judged right in this particular. The King of England
lent a willing ear to his proposals, and engaged in a plan
for dismembering a kingdom, in despite of the natives,
and in violation of every law human or divine.</P>
<P>§ XIV. While the French King cajoled William with
this negotiation, the Marquis d'Harcourt, his ambassador
to Spain, was engaged in a game of a different nature at
Madrid. The Queen of Spain, suspecting the designs of
France, exerted all her interest in behalf of the King of
the Romans, to whom she was nearly related. She new∣modelled
the council, bestowed the government of Milan
on Prince Vaudemont, and established the Prince of
Hesse d'Armstadt as viceroy of Catalonia. Notwithstand∣ing
all her efforts, she could not prevent the French mi∣nister
from acquiring some influence in the Spanish coun∣cils.
He was instructed to procure the succession of the
crown for one of the Dauphin's sons, or at least to hin∣der
it from devolving upon the Emperor's children. With
a view to give weight to his negociations, the French
King ordered an army of sixty thousand men to advance
towards the frontiers of Catalonia and Navarre, while a
great number of ships and gallies cruised along the coast,
and entered the harbours of Spain. Harcourt immediately
began to form his party: he represented, that Philip IV.
had no power to dispose of his crown, against the laws of
nature and the constitution of the realm: that by the
order of succession, the crown ought to descend to the
children of his daughter, in preference to more distant
relations: that, if the Spaniards would declare in favour
<PB N="328" REF="332"/>
of the Dauphin's second son, the Duke of Anjou, they
might train him up in the manners and customs of their
country. When he found them averse to this proposal,
he assured them his master would approve of the Electoral
Prince of Bavaria, rather than consent to the succession's
devolving upon a son of the Emperor. Nay, he hinted,
that if they would choose a sovereign among themselves,
they might depend upon the protection of his Most
Christian Majesty, who had no other view than that of
preventing the House of Austria from becoming too for∣midable
to the liberties of Europe. The Queen of Spain
having discovered the intrigues of this minister, conveyed
the King to Toledo, on pretence that the air of Madrid
was prejudicial to his health. Harcourt immediately took
the alarm. He supposed her intention was to prevail upon
her husband, in his solitude, to confirm the last will of
his father, and his doubts were all removed, when he
understood that the Count de Harrach, the Imperial am∣bassador,
had privately repaired to Toledo. He forthwith
took the same road, pretending to have received a memo∣rial
from his master, with a positive order to deliver it in∣to
the King's own hand. He was given to understand,
that the management of foreign affairs had been left to
the care of Cardinal Corduba at Madrid, and that the King's
health would not permit him to attend to business. The
purport of the memorial was, an offer of French forces to
assist in raising the siege of Ceuta in Barbary, which the
Moors had lately undertaken: but this offer was civilly
declined. Harcourt, not yet discouraged, redoubled his
efforts at Madrid, and found means to engage Cardinal
Portocarrero in the interests of his master. In the mean
time Louis concluded an alliance with Sweden, under the
pretext of preserving and securing the common peace, by
such means as should be judged most proper and conve∣nient.
During these transactions, King William was
not wanting in his endeavours to terminate the war of
Hungary, which had raged fifteen years without inter∣mission.
About the middle of August, Lord Paget and
<PB N="329" REF="333"/>
Mr. Colliers, ambassadors from England and Holland,
arrived in the Turkish camp near Belgrade; and a con∣gress
being opened under their mediation, the peace of
Carlowitz was signed on the twenty-sixth day of January.
By this treaty, the Emperor remained in possession of all
his conquests: Caminieck was restored to the Poles: all
the Morea, with several fortresses in Dalmatia, were
ceded to the Venetians; and the Czar of Muscovy re∣tained
Azoph during a truce of two years; so that the
Turks, by this pacification, lost great part of their Euro∣pean
dominions. The Cardinal Primate of Poland, who
had strenuously adhered to the Prince of Conti, was pre∣vailed
upon to acknowledge Augustus; and the commo∣tions
in Lithuania being appeased, peace was established
through all Christendom.</P>
<P>§ XV. In the beginning of December the King arrived
in England, where a new parliament had been chosen, and
prorogued on account of his Majesty's absence, which was
prolonged by contrary winds, and tempestuous weather.
His ministry had been at very little pains to influence the
elections, which generally fell upon men of Revolution-principles,
though they do not seem to have been much
devoted to the person of their sovereign: yet their choice
of Sir Thomas Lyttelton for Speaker seemed to presage a
session favourable to the ministry. The two Houses being
convened on the sixth day of December, the King, in his
speech, observed. That the safety, honour, and happiness
of the kingdom would in a great measure depend upon
the strength which they should think proper to maintain
by sea and land. He desired they would make some fur∣ther
progress in discharging the national debt; contrive
effectual expedients for employing the poor; pass good
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills for the advancement of trade, and the discourage∣ment
of profanity; and act with unanimity and dispatch.
The Commons of this new parliament were so irritated at
the King's presuming to maintain a greater number of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roops than their predecessors had voted, that they resolved
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should feel the weight of their displeasure. They
<PB N="330" REF="334"/>
omitted the common compliment of an address: they re∣solved
that all the forces of England, in English pay, ex∣ceeding
seven thousand men, should be forthwith dis∣banded;
as also those in Ireland, exceeding twelve thou∣sand;
and that those retained should be his Majesty's na∣tural-born
subjects. A bill was brought in on these reso∣lutions,
and prosecuted with peculiar eagerness, to the
unspeakable mortification of King William, who was not
only extremely sensible of the affront, but also particularly
chagrined to see himself disabled from maintaining his
Dutch guards, and the regiments of French refugees, to
which he was uncommonly attached. Before the meeting
of the parliament, the ministry gave him to understand,
that they should be able to procure a vote for ten or twelve
thousand; but they would not undertake for a greater
number. He professed himself dissatisfied with the pro∣posal,
observing, that they might as well disband the
whole, as leave so few. The ministers would not run the
risque of losing all their credit, by proposing a greater
number; and, having received no directions on this subject,
sat silent when it was debated in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Such was the indignation of William, kindled
by this conduct of his ministry and his parliament, that he
threatened to abandon the government; and had actually
penned a speech to be pronounced to both Houses on that
occasion: but he was diverted from this purpose by his
ministry and confidents, and resolved to pass the bill by
which he had been so much offended. Accordingly, when
it was ready for the royal assent, he went to the House of
Peers, where having sent for the Commons, he told them,
that, although he might think himself unkindly used, in
being deprived of his guards, which had constantly at∣tended
him in all his actions: yet, as he believed nothing
could be more fatal to the nation than any distrust or jea∣lousy
between him and his parliament, he was come to
pass the bill, according to their desire. At the same time
for his own justification, and in discharge of the trust re∣posed
in him, he declared, that in his own judgement th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="331" REF="335"/>
nation was left too much exposed; and that it was in∣cumbent
upon them to provide such a strength as might
be necessary for the safety of the kingdom. They thanked
him, in an address, for his undeniable proof of his readi∣ness
to comply with the desires of his parliament. They
assured him, he should never have reason to think the
Commons were undutiful or unkind; for they would, on
all occasions, stand by, and assist him in the preservation
of his sacred person, and in the support of his government,
against all his enemies whatsoever. The Lords presented
an address to the same effect; and the King assured both
Houses, he entertained no doubts of their loyalty and af∣fection.
He forthwith issued orders for reducing the army
to the number of seven thousand men, to be maintained in
England under the name of guards and garrisons; and,
hoping the hearts of the Commons were now mollified, he
made another effort in favour of his Dutch guards, whom
he could not dismiss without the most sensible regret.
Lord Ranelagh was sent with a written message to the
Commons, giving them to understand, that the necessary
preparations were made for transporting the guards who
came with him into England, and that they should em∣bark
immediately, unless, out of consideration to him, the
House should be disposed to find a way for continuing them
longer in the service; a favour which his Majesty would
take very kindly. The Commons, instead of complying
with his inclination, presented an address, in which they
professed unspeakable grief, that he should propose any
thing to which they could not consent with due regard to
the constitution, which he had come over to restore, and
so often hazarded his royal person to preserve. They re∣minded
him of the declaration, in which he had promised
that all the foreign forces should be sent out of the king∣dom.
They observed, that nothing conduced more to the
happiness and welfare of the nation, than an entire confi∣dence
between the King and people, which could no way
be so firmly established as by entrusting his sacred person
with his own subjects, who had so eminently signalized
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
themselves during the late long and expensive war. They
received a soothing answer to the address, but remained
firm to their purpose, in which the King was fain to ac∣quiesce;
and the Dutch guards were transported to Hol∣land.
At a time when they declared themselves so well
pleased with their deliverer, such an opposition, in an
affair of very little consequence, savoured more of clownish
obstinacy than of patriotism. In the midst of all their
professions of regard, they entertained a national prejudice
against himself, and all the foreigners in his service. Even
in the House of Commons his person was treated with great
disrespect in virulent insinuations. They suggested, that
he neither loved nor trusted the English nation: that he
treated the natives with the most disagreeable reserve; and
chose his confidents from the number of strangers that sur∣rounded
him: that, after every session of parliament, he
retired from the kingdom, to enjoy an indolent and inglo∣rious
privacy with a few favourites. These suggestions
were certainly true. He was extremely disgusted with the
English, whom he considered as malicious, ignorant, and
ungrateful, and he took no pains to disguise his senti∣ments.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The Commons having effected a dissolution of
the army, voted fifteen thousand seamen, and a propor∣tionable
fleet for the security of the kingdom: they granted
one million, four hundred and eighty-four thousand fifteen
pounds, for the services of the year, to be raised by a tax
of three shillings in the pound upon lands, personal estates,
pensions, and offices. A great number of priests and
Roman catholicks, who had been frighted away by the
Revolution, were now encouraged by the treaty of Ryswick
to return, and appeared in all public places of London
and Westminister, with remarkable effrontery. The ene∣mies
of the government whispered about, that the treaty
contained a secret article in favour of those who professed
that religion; and some did not even scruple to insinuate,
that William was a papist in his heart. The Commons
alarmed at the number and insolence of those religionists,
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
desired the King, in an address, to remove by proclama∣tion
all papists and nonjurors from the city of London and
parts adjacent, and put the laws in execution against them,
that the wicked designs they were always hatching might be
effectually disappointed. The King gratified them in their
request of a proclamation, which was not much re∣garded:
but a remarkable law was enacted against papists
in the course of the ensuing session. The old East-India
company, about this period, petitioned the Lower House,
to make some provision that their corporation might subsist
for the residue of the term of twenty-one years, granted
by his Majesty's charter: that the payment of the five
pounds per cent. by the late act for settling the trade to the
East-Indies, might be settled and adjusted in such a
manner, as not to remain a burthen on the petitioners;
and that such further considerations might be had for
their relief, and for the preservation of the East-India
trade, as should be thought reasonable. A bill was brought
in upon the subject of this petition; but rejected at the
second reading. Discontents had risen to such a height,
that some members began to assert, they were not bound
to maintain the votes and credit of the former parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE>
and, upon this maxim, would have contributed their in∣terest
towards a repeal of the act made in favour of the
new company: but such a scheme was of too dangerous
consequence to the publick credit, to be carried into exe∣cution.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. That spirit of peevishness which could not be
gratified with this sacrifice, produced an enquiry into the
management of naval affairs, which was aimed at the
Earl of Orford, a nobleman whose power gave umbrage,
and whose wealth excited envy. He officiated both as
Treasurer of the Navy, and Lord-Commissioner of the
Admiralty, and seemed to have forgot the sphere from
which he had risen to title and office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1699.</NOTE> The Commons
drew up an address, complaining of some unimportant
articles of mismanagement in the conduct of the navy;
and the Earl was wise enough to avoid further prosecution,
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
by resigning his employments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1699.</NOTE> On the fourth day of May
the King closed the session, with a short speech, hinting
dissatisfaction at their having neglected to consider son e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
points which he had recommended to their attention; and
the parliament was prorogued to the first of June<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About the latter end of March the Earl of Warwick and Lord Mohun were tried by their peers in Westminster-hall, for the murther of Captain Richard Coote, who had been killed in a midnight combat of three on e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch side.

<P>Villers, Earl of Jersey, who had been sent ambassador to France, was ap∣pointed secretary of state, in the room of the Duke of Shrewsbury. This nobleman was created lord-chamberlain: the Earl of Manchester was sent ambassador extraordinary to France: the Earl of Pembroke was declared lord-president of the council; and Lord Viscount Lonsdale keeper of the privy-seal.</P></NOTE>. In a
little time after this prorogation, his Majesty appointed a
regency<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Consisting of the Lord-Chancellor, the Lord-President, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord-Steward of the Household, the Earl of Bridgewater, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commissioner of the Admiralty, the Earl of Marlborough, the Earl <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jersey, and Mr. Montagu.</NOTE>; and on the second day of June embarked for
Holland.</P>
<P>§ XIX. In Ireland nothing of moment was transacted.
The parliament of that kingdom passed an act for raising
one hundred and twenty thousand pounds on lands, tene∣ment,
and hereditaments, to defray the expense of main∣taining
twelve thousand men who had been voted by the
Commons of England: then the assembly was prorogued.
A new commission afterwards arrived at Dublin, consti∣tuting
the Duke of Bolton, the Earls of Berkeley and
Galway, lords-justices of Ireland. The clamour in Scot∣land
increased against the ministry, who had disowned
their company, and in a great measure defeated the design
from which they had promised themselves such heaps of
treasure. Notwithstanding the discouragements to which
their company had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exposed, they fitted out two of
four large ships which had been built at Hamburgh for
their service. These were laden with a cargo for traffick,
with some artillery and military stores; and the adven∣turers
embarking, to the number of twelve hundred, they
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
sailed from the frith of Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1699.</NOTE> with some tenders, on
the seventeenth day of July in the preceding year. At
Madeira they took in a supply of wine, and then steered
to Crab-island in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas, lying
between Santa Cruz and Porto Rico. Their design was
to take possession of this little island; but, when they en∣tered
the road, they saw a large tent pitched upon the
strand, and the Danish colours flying. Finding them∣selves
anticipated in this quarter, they directed their course
to the coast of Darien, where they treated with the natives
for the establishment of their colony, and taking possession
of the ground, to which they gave the name of Caledonia,
began to execute their plan of erecting a town under the
appellation of New Edinburgh, by the direction of their
council, consisting of Patterson the projector, and six
other directors. They had no sooner completed their
settlement, than they wrote a letter to the King, contain∣ing
a detail of their proceedings. They pretended they
had received undoubted intelligence, that the French in∣tended
to make a settlement on that coast; and that their
colony would be the means of preventing the evil conse∣quences
which might arise to his Majesty's kingdom and
dominions from the execution of such a scheme. They
acknowledged his goodness in granting those privileges by
which their company was established: they implored the
continuance of his royal favour and protection, as they
had punctually adhered to the conditions of the act of par∣liament
and the patent they had obtained.</P>
<P>§ XX. By this time, however, the King was resolved
to crush them effectually. He understood that the greater
part of their provisions had been consumed before they set
sail from Scotland, and foresaw that they must be reduced
to a starving condition, if not supplied from the English
colonies. That they might be debarred of all such as∣sistance,
he sent orders to the governours of Jamaica,
and the other English settlements in America, to issue
proclamations, prohibiting, under the severest penalties,
all his Majesty's subjects from holding any correspondence
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
with the Scottish colony, or assisting it, in any shape, with
arms, ammunition, or provision, on pretence that they had
not communicated their design to his Majesty, but had
peopled Darien, in violation of the peace subsisting between
him and his allies. Their colony was, doubtless, a very
dangerous encroachment upon the Spaniards, as it would
have commanded the passage between Porto Bello and
Panama, and divided the Spanish empire in America.
The French King complained of the invasion, and offered
to supply the court of Madrid with a fleet to dislodge
the interlopers. Colonna Marquis de Canales, the Spa∣nish
ambassador at the court of London, presented a
memorial to King William, remonstrating against the
settlement of this colony, as a mark of disregard, and a
breach of the alliance between the two crowns; and de∣claring,
that his master would take proper measures against
such hostilities. The Scots affirmed, that the natives of
Darien were a free people, whom the Spaniards had
in vain attempted to subdue: that, therefore, they had
an original and incontrovertible right to dispose of their
own lands, part of which the company had purchased for
a valuable consideration. But there was another cause
more powerful than the remonstrances of the Spanish
court, to which this colony fell a sacrifice; and that was,
the jealousy of the English traders and planters. Darien
was said to be a country abounding with gold, which would
in a little time enrich the adventurers. The Scots were
known to be an enterprising and pertinacious people; and
their harbour near Golden-island was already declared a
free-port. The English apprehended that their planters
would be allured into this new colony, by the double
prospect of finding gold, and plundering the Spaniards
that the buccaneers in particular would choose it as their
chief residence: that the plantations of England would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
deserted: that Darien would become another Algiers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and that the settlement would produce a rupture <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Spain, in consequence of which the English effects in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
kingdom would be con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated. The Dutch, too, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
said to have been jealous of a company, which in time
might have proved their competitors in the illicit commerce
to the Spanish main; and to have hardened the King's
heart against the new settlers, whom he abandoned to their
fate, notwithstanding the repeated petitions and remon∣strances
of their constituents. Famine compelled the first
adventurers to quit the coast: a second recruit of men and
provisions was sent thither from Scotland: but, one of
their ships, laden with provision, being burned by acci∣dent,
they likewise deserted the place: another re-enforce∣ment
arrived, and being better provided than the two
former, might have maintained their footing; but they
were soon divided into factions that rendered all their
schemes abortive. The Spaniards advanced against them;
when, finding themselves incapable of withstanding the
enemy, they sollicited a capitulation, by virtue of which
they were permitted to retire. Thus vanished all the
golden dreams of the Scottish nation, which had engaged
in this design with incredible eagerness, and even em∣barked
a greater sum of money than ever they had advan∣ced
upon any other occasion. They were now not only
disappointed in their expectations of wealth and affluence;
but a great number of families was absolutely ruined by
the miscarriage of the design, which they imputed solely to
the conduct of King William. The whole kingdom of
Scotland seemed to join in the clamour that was raised
against their sovereign. They taxed him with double-dealing,
inhumanity, and base ingratitude, to a people
who had lavished their treasure and best blood in support of
his government, and in the gratification of his ambition:
and had their power been equal to their animosity, in all
probability a rebellion would have ensued.</P>
<P>§ XXI. William, mean while, enjoyed himself at Loo,
where he was visited by the Duke of Zell, with whom he
had long cultivated an intimacy of friendship. During
his residence in this place, the Earl of Portland and the
Grand Pensionary of Holland frequently conferred with
the French ambassador, Count Tallard, upon the subject
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
of the Spanish succession. The first plan of the partition
being defeated by the death of the young Prince of Bavaria,
they found it necessary to concert another, and began a
private negociation for that purpose. The court of Spain,
apprised of their intention, sent a written remonstrance to
Mr. Stanhope, the English minister at Madrid, expressing
their resentment at this unprecedented method of proceed∣ing,
and desiring that a stop might be put to those intrigues,
seeing the King of Spain would of himself take the neces∣sary
steps for preserving the publick tranquillity, in case
he should die without heirs of his body. A representation
of the same kind was made to the ministers of France and
Holland: the Marquis de Canales, the Spanish ambassador
at London, delivered a memorial to the lords-justices,
couched in the most virulent terms, against this transacti∣on,
and even appealing from the King to the parliament.
This Spaniard was pleased with an opportunity to insult
King William, who hated his person, and had forbid him
the court, on account of his appearing covered in his Ma∣jesty's
presence. The regency had no sooner communi∣cated
this paper to the King, than he ordered the ambassa∣dor
to quit the kingdom in eighteen days, and to remain
within his own house till the time of his departure. He
was likewise given to understand, that no writing would
be received from him or any of his domesticks. Mr.
Stanhope was directed to complain at Madrid of the assront
offered to his master, which he stiled an insolent and saucy
attempt to stir up fedition in the kingdom, by appealing
to the people and parliament of England against his Ma∣jesty.
The court of Spain justified what their minister
had done, and in their turn ordered Mr. Stanhope to leave
their dominions. Don Bernardo de Quiros, the Spanish
ambassador in Holland, prepared a memorial on the same
subject, to the States-General; which, however, they
refused to accept. These remonstrances did not interrupt
the negociation, in which Louis was so eager, that he
complained of William, as if he had not employed his
whole influence in prevailing upon the Dutch to signify
<PB N="339" REF="345"/>
their accession to the articles agreed upon by France and
England: but his Britannick Majesty found means to re∣move
this jealousy.</P>
<P>§ XXII. About the middle of October William returned
to England, and conferred upon the Duke of Shrewsbury
the office of chamberlain, vacant since the resignation of
Sunderland. Mr. Montague at the same period resigned
his seat at the Treasury-board, together with the chancel∣lorship
of the Exchequer, either foreseeing uncommon
difficulty in managing a House of Commons, after they
had been dismissed in ill-humour, or dreading the interest
of his enemies, who might procure a vote that his two
places were inconsistent. The King opened the session of
parliament, on the sixteenth day of November, with a
long speech, advising a further provision for the safety of
the kingdom by sea and land, as well as the repairs of
ships and fortifications; exhorting the Commons to make
good the deficiencies of the funds, discharge the debts of
the nation, and provide the necessary supplies. He recom∣mended
some good bill for the more effectual preventing and
punishing unlawful and clandestine trading; and expressed
a desire, that some method should be taken for employing
the poor, which were become a burthen to the kingdom.
He assured them, his resolutions were to countenance virtue
and discourage vice: and that he would decline no diffi∣culties
and dangers, where the welfare and prosperity of the
nation might be concerned. He concluded with these
words: “Since, then our aims are only for the general
good, let us act w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h confidence in one another; which
will not fail, with God's blessing, to make me a happy
king, and you a great and flourishing people.”—The
Commons were now become wanton in their disgust.
Though they had received no real provocation, they re∣solved
to mortify him with their proceedings. They af∣fected
to put odious interpretations on the very harmless
expression of, “Let us act with confidence in one another.”
Instead of an address of thanks, according to the usual
custom, they presented a sullen remonstrance, complain∣ing,
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
that a jealousy and disgust had been raised of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and affection; and desiring he would show marks of his high
displeasure towards all persons who had presumed to misre∣present
their proceedings to his Majesty. He declared, in his
answer, that no person had ever dared to misrepresent their
proceedings; and, that if any should presume to impose
upon him by such calumnies, he would treat them as his
worst enemies.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The House was not in a humour to be ap∣peased
with soothing promises and protestations: they
determined to distress him, by prosecuting his ministers.
During the war the colonies of North-America had grown
rich by piracy. One Kidd, the master of a sloop, under∣took
to suppress the pirates, provided the government
would furnish him with a ship of thirty guns, well manned.
The board of Admiralty declaring that such a number of
seamen could not be spared from the publick service, Kidd
was equipped by the private subscription of the Lord-Chan∣cellor,
the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Romney, Or∣ford,
and Bellamont, Sir Edward Harrison, and Colonel
Livingstone, of New-York. The King promised to con∣tribute
one half of the expense, and reserved to himself
one tenth of the profits; but he never advanced the mo∣ney.
Kidd being thus equipped, and provided with a
commission to act against the French, as well as to make
war on certain pirates therein mentioned by name, set sail
from Plymouth: but, instead of cruising on the coast of
America, he directed his course to the East-Indies, where
he himself turned pirate, and took a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich ship belonging to
the Moors. Having divided his booty with his crew,
ninety of whom left him, in order to join other adventu∣rers,
he burned his own ship, and sailed with his prize to
the West-Indies. There he purchased a sloop, in which
he steered for North America, leaving part of his men in the
prize, to remain in one of the Leeward-islands, until they
should receive further instructions. Arriving on the coast
of New-York, he sent one Emmet to make his peace with
the Earl of Bellamont, the governor of that province,
who inveigled him into a negociation, in the course of
<PB N="341" REF="347"/>
which he was apprehended. Then his lordship sent an
account of his proceedings to the secretary of state, desiring
that he would send for the prisoners to England, as there
was no law in that colony for punishing piracy with
death, and the majority of the people favoured that practice.
The Admiralty, by order of the lords-justices, dispatched
the ship Rochester to bring home the prisoners and their
effects: but, after having been tossed for some time with
tempestuous weather, this vessel was obliged to return to
Plymouth in a shattered condition. This incident furnished
the malcontents with a colour to paint the ministry as the
authors and abettors of a piratical expedition, which they
wanted to screen from the cognizance of the publick. The
old East-India company had complained to the regency of
the capture made by Kidd in the East-Indies, apprehending,
as the vessel belonged to the Moors, they should be exposed
to the resentment of the Mogul. In the beginning of
December, this subject being brought abruptly into the
House of Commons, a motion was made, That the letters
patent granted to the Earl of Bellamont and others, of pi∣rates
goods, were dishonourable to the King, against the
laws of nations, contrary to the laws and statutes of the
land, invasive of property, and destructive of trade and com∣merce.
A warm debate ensued, in the course of which,
some members declaimed with great bitterness against the
Chancellor and the Duke of Shrewsbury, as partners in a
piratical scheme: but these imputations were refuted, and
the motion was rejected by a great majority. Not but they
might have justly stigmatized the expedition as a little
mean adventure, in which those noblemen had embarked
with a view to their own private advantage.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. While this affair was in agitation among the
Commons, the attention of the Upper House was employed
upon the case of Dr. Watson, Bishop of St. David's. This
prelate was supposed to have paid a valuable consideration
for his bishoprick: and, after his elevation, had sold the
preferments in his gift, with a view of being reimbursed.
He was accused of simony; and, after a solemn hearing
before the Archbishop of Canterbury and six suffragans,
<PB N="342" REF="348"/>
convicted and deprived. Then he pleaded his privilege:
so that the affair was brought into the House of Lords,
who refused to own him as a peer after he had ceased to be
a bishop. Thus disappointed, he had recourse to the court
of delegates, by whom the Archbishop's sentence was con∣firmed.
The next effort that the Commons made, with
a view of mortifying King William, was to raise a clamour
against Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Sarum. He was represented
in the House as a very unfit preceptor for the Duke of
Gloucester, both as a Scottish man, and author of that
pastoral letter which had been burned by order of the par∣liament,
for asserting that William had a right to the
crown from conquest. A motion was made for addressing
his Majesty, that this prelate might be dismissed from his
employment, but rejected by a great majority. Burnet
had acted with uncommon on integrity in accepting the trust.
He had declined the office, which he was in a manner
forced to accept. He had offered to resign his bishoprick,
thinking the employment of a tutor would interfere with
the duty of a pastor. He insisted upon the Duke's resi∣dence
all the summer at Windsor, which is in the diocese
of Sarum; and added to his private charities the whole
income of his new office.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The circumstance on which the anti-courtiers
built their chief hope of distressing or disgracing the go∣vernment,
was the enquiry into the Irish forfeitures, which
the King had distributed among his own dependents. The
commissioners appointed by parliament to examine these
particulars, were Annesley, Trenchard, Hamilton, Lang∣ford,
the Earl of Drogheda, Sir Francis Brewster, and
Sir Richard Leving. The first four were actuated by all
the virulence of faction: the other three were secretly
guided by ministerial influence. They began their enquiry
in Ireland, and proceeded with such severity as seemed to
slow rather from resentment to the court, than from a love of
justice and abhorrence of corruption. They in particular
scrutinized a grant of an estate which the King had made
to Mrs. Villiers, now Countess of Orkney, so as to expose
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>
his Majesty's partiality for that favourite, and subject him
to an additional load of popular odium. In the course of
their examination, the Earl of Drogheda, Leving, and
Brewster, opposed the rest of the commissioners in divers
articles of the report, which they refused to sign, and
sent over a memorial to the House of Commons, ex∣plaining
their reasons for dissenting from their col∣leagues.
By this time, however, they were considered
as hirelings of the court, and no regard was paid to their
representations. The others delivered their report, de∣claring
that a million and a half of money might be raised
from the sale of the confiscated estates; and a bill was
brought in for applying them to the use of the publick.
A motion being made to reserve a third part for the King's
disposal, it was over-ruled: then the Commons passed an
extraordinary vote, importing, that they would not re∣ceive
any petition from any person whatsoever concerning
the grants; and that they would consider the great ser∣vices
performed by the commissioners appointed to enquire
into the forfeited estates. They resolved, That the four
commissioners who had signed the report had acquitted
themselves with understanding, courage, and integrity;
and That Sir Richard Leving, as author of groundless and
scandalous aspersions cast upon his four colleagues, should
be committed prisoner to the Tower. They afterwards
came to the following resolution, which was presented to
the King in form of an address: That the procuring and
passing those grants had occasioned great debts upon the
nation, and heavy taxes upon the people, and highly re∣flected
upon the King's honour; and, That the officers
and instruments concerning the same had highly failed
in the performance of their trust and duty. The King
answered, That he was not only led by inclination, but
thought himself obliged in justice to reward those who had
served well in the reduction of Ireland out of the estates
forfeited to him by the rebellion in that kingdom. He
observed, that as the long war had left the nation much in
debt, their taking just and effectual ways for lessening
<PB N="344" REF="350"/>
that debt, and supporting publick credit, was what, in his
opinion, would best contribute to the honour, interest, and
safety of the kingdom. This answer kindled a flame of
indignation in the House. They forthwith resolved,
That the adviser of it had used his utmost endeavours to
create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the King
and his people.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. They prepared, finished, and passed a bill
of resumption. They ordered the report of the commissi∣oners,
together with the King's promise and speeches, and
the former resolutions of the House touching the forfeited
estates in Ireland, to be printed and published for their
justification; and they resolved, That the procuring or
passing exorbitant grants by any member, now of the
privy-council, or by any other that had been a privy-counsellor,
in this, or any former reign, to his use of
benefit, was a high crime and misdemeanour. That
justice might be done to purchasers and creditors in the act
of resumption, thirteen trustees were authorised and em∣powered
to hear and determine all claims relating to those
estates, to sell them to the best purchasers; and the money
arising from the sale was appropriated to pay the arrears of
the army. It passed under the title of a bill for granting an
aid to his Majesty, by the sale of forfeited and other estates
and interests in Ireland; and that it might undergo no al∣teration
in the House of Lords, it was consolidated with the
money bill for the services of the year. In the House of Lords
it produced warm debates; and some alterations were made,
which the Commons unanimously rejected. They seemed
to be now more than ever exasperated against the ministry,
and ordered a list of the privy-council to be laid before the
House. The Lords demanded conferences, which served
only to exasperate the two Houses against each other; for
the Peers insisted upon their amendments, and the Com∣mons
were so provoked at their interfering in a money-bill,
that they determined to give a loose to their resentment.
They ordered all the doors of their House to be shut,
that no members should go forth. Then they took into
<PB N="345" REF="351"/>
consideration the report of the Irish forfeitures, with the
list of the privy-counsellors; and a question was moved,
That an address should be made to his Majesty, to remove
John Lord Somers, Chancellor of England, from his pre∣sence
and councils for ever. This, however, was carried
in the negative by a great majority. The King was ex∣tremely
chagrined at the bill, which he considered as an in∣vasion
of his prerogative, an insult on his person, and an
injury to his friends and servants; and he at first resolved
to hazard all the consequences of refusing to pass it into
a law: but he was diverted from his purpose by the re∣monstrances
of those in whom he chiefly confided. He
could not, however, dissemble his resentment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole's Mem. State Tracts. Lamberty. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> He be∣came
sullen, peevish, and morose; and his enemies did
not fail to make use of this additional ill-humour, as a
proof of his aversion to the English people. Though the
motion against the Chancellor had miscarried, the Commons
resolved to address his Majesty, that no person who was
not a native of his dominions, except his Royal Highness
Prince George of Denmark, should be admitted into his
Majesty's councils in England or Ireland. This resolution
was levelled against the Earls of Portland, Albemarle, and
Galway: but, before the address could be presented, the
King went to the House of Peers, and having passed the
bill which had produced such a ferment, with some others,
commanded the Earl of Bridgewater, Speaker of the House,
in the absence of the Chancellor, who was indisposed, to
prorogue the parliament to the twenty-third day of May.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In the course of this session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1700.</NOTE> the Commons
having prosecuted their enquiry into the conduct of Kidd,
brought in a bill for the more effectual suppressing of piracy,
which passed into a law: understanding afterwards, that Kidd
was brought over to England, they presented an address to
the King, desiring that he might not be tried, discharged, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardoned, till the next session of parliament; and his Majes∣ty
complied with their request. Boiling still with indignati∣on
against the Lord-Chancellor, who had turned many dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffected
persons out of the commission of the peace, the
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
House ordered a bill to be prepared for qualifying justices
of the peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1700.</NOTE> and appointed a committee to inspect the
commissions. This reporting, that many dissenters and
men of small fortunes, depending on the court, were put
into those places, the Commons declared, in an address,
That it would much conduce to the service of his Ma∣jesty,
and the good of this kingdom, that gentlemen of
quality and good estates should be restored, and put into
the commissions of the peace and lieutenancy: and that
men of small estates be neither continued, nor put into
the said commissions. The King assured them he was
of the same opinion: and that he would give directions
accordingly. They were so mollified by this instance of
his condescension, that they thanked him in a body for
his gracious answer. They passed a bill to exculpate such
as had neglected to sign the association, either through
mistake, or want of opportunity. Having received a
petition from the Lancashire clergy, complaining of the
insolence and attempts of popish priests, they appointed a
committee to enquire how far the laws against popish re∣fugees
had been put in execution; and upon the report a
bill was brought in, complying with the prayer of the
petition. It decreed a further reward to such persons as
should discover and convict popish priests and jesuits; and
perpetual imprisonment for those convicted on the oath of
one or more witnesses. It enacted, That no person born
after the twenty-fifth day of March next ensuing, being a
papist, should be capable of inheriting any title of ho∣nour
or estate within the kingdom of England, dominion
of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed; and, That
no papist should be capable of purchasing any lands, tene∣ments,
or hereditaments, either in his own name, or in the
name of any other person in trust for him. Several alter∣ations
were made in this first draft, before it was finished
and sent up to the Lords, some of whom proposed amend∣ments:
these, however, were not adopted; and the bil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
obtained the royal assent, contrary to the expectation o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
those who prosecuted the measure, on the supposition tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>
the King was a favourer of papists.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1700.</NOTE> After all, the bill
was deficient in necessary clauses to enforce execution;
so that the law was very little regarded in the sequel.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The court sustained another insult from the
old East-India company, who petitioned the House that
they might be continued by parliamentary authority during
the remaining part of the time prescribed in their charter.
They, at the same time, published a state of their case, in
which they expatiated upon the equity of their claims, and
magnified the injuries they had undergone. The new
company drew up an answer to this remonstrance, exposing
the corrupt practices of their adversaries. But the in∣fluence
of their great patron, Mr. Montagu, was now
vanished: the supply was not yet discussed, and the mi∣nistry
would not venture to provoke the Commons, who
seemed propitious to the old company, and actually passed
a bill in their favour. This, meeting with no opposition
in the Upper House, was enacted into a law, renewing
their establishment: so that now there were two rival
companies of merchants trading to the East-Indies. The
Commons, not yet satisfied with the vexations to which
they had exposed their sovereign, passed a bill to appoint
commissioners for taking and examining the public ac∣counts.
Another law was made, to prohibit the use of
India silks and stuffs which interfered with the English
manufactures: a third, to take off the duties on the ex∣portation
of woolen manufactures, corn, grain, meal,
bread, and biscuit: and a fourth, in which provision was
made for punishing governors, or commanders in chief of
plantations and colonies, in case they should commit any
crimes or acts of injustice and oppression in the exercise
of their administration.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The people of Scotland still continued in
violent agitation. They published a pamphlet, contain∣ing
a detail of their grievances, which they in a great mea∣sure
ascribed to his Majesty. A complaint being preferred
to the House of Commons against this performance, it
was voted a false, scandalous, and traitorous libel, and
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hang∣man.
The Commons addressed his Majesty, to issue his
royal proclamation for apprehending the author, printer,
and publisher of the said libel; and he complied with
their request. The Scottish company had sent up an ad∣dress
to the King, in behalf of some adventurers who were
wrongfully detained prisoners in Carthagena: but Lord
Basil Hamilton, who undertook the charge of this petition,
was refused admittance to his Majesty, on pretence of his
being suspected of disaffection to the government. The
King, however, wrote to his council for Scotland, that he
would demand the enlargement of the prisoners, and coun∣tenance
any laudable measure that could advance the trade
of that kingdom. The directors of the company, not
content with this declaration, importuned their Lord Chan∣cellor,
who was in London, to procure access for Lord
Basil Hamilton; and the ministry took shelter from their
sollicitations behind a parliamentary enquiry. The sub∣ject
of the Scottish colony being introduced into the House
of Lords, where the ministerial influence preponderated,
a vehement debate arose, not from any regard to the interest
of Scotland, but from mere opposition to the court, which,
however, triumphed in the issue. A motion was made,
that the settlement of the Scotch colony at Darien was
inconsistent with the good of the plantation-trade of Eng∣land;
and passed in the affirmative by a small majority.
Then they presented an address, declaring their sympathy
with the losses of their fellow-subjects, and their opinion,
that a prosecution of the design must end, not only in sfar
greater disappointments to themselves, but also prove very
inconvenient to the trade and quiet of the kingdom. They
reminded him of the address of both Houses, touching that
settlement; and they expressed their approbation of the
orders he had sent to the governors of the plantations
on this subject. The King, in his answer to the address,
in which the Commons refused to concur, took the op∣portunity
of exhorting them to consider of an union be∣tween
the two kingdoms, as a measure, than which nothing
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
could more contribute to their mutual security and advan∣tage.
The Lords, in pursuance of this advice, prepared a bill,
appointing certain commissioners of the realm of England
to treat with commissioners of Scotland for the weal of
both kingdoms: but it was obstructed in the House of
Commons, who were determined to thwart every step that
might tend to lessen the disgust, or appease the animosity
of the Scottish nation. The malcontents insinuated, that
the King's opposition to the Scottish company flowed
neither from his regard to the interest of England, nor from
his punctual observance of treaties with Spain; but solely
from his attachment to the Dutch, who maintained an
advantageous trade from the island of Curaçoa to the Spa∣nish
plantations in America, and were apprehensive that
the Scottish company would deprive them of this com∣merce.
This interpretation served as fuel to the flame al∣ready
kindled in Scotland, and industriously blown up by
the calumnies of the Jacobites. Their parliament adopt∣ed
the company as a national concern, by voting, That
the colony of Caledonia in Darien was a legal and rightful
settlement, which the parliament would maintain and sup∣port.
On account of this resolution the session was for
some time discontinued: but, when the Scots understood
their new settlement was totally abandoned, their capital
lost, and all their hope entirely vanished, the whole nation
was seized with a transport of fury. They loudly exclaimed
that they had been sacrisiced and basely betrayed in that
quarter where they were intitled to protection. They con∣certed
an address to the King, couched in a very high
strain, representing the necessity of an immediate parlia∣ment.
It was circulated about the kingdom for subscrip∣tions,
signed by a great number of those who sat in parlia∣ment,
and presented to the King by Lord Ross, who with
some others was deputed for that purpose. The King told
them, they should know his intention in Scotland; and
in the mean time adjourned their parliament by procla∣mation.
The people, exasperated at this new provocation,
began to form the draft of a second national address, to
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
be signed by the shires and boroughs of the kingdom
but, before this could be finished, the King wrote a letter
to the Duke of Queensberry, and the privy-council of that
nation, which was published for the satisfaction of the
people. He professed himself grieved at the nation's loss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and willing to grant what might be needful for the relie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and ease of the kingdom. He assured them, he had their
interest at heart; and that his good subjects should have
convincing proofs of his sincere inclination to advance the
wealth and prosperity of that his ancient kingdom. He
said, he hoped this declaration would be satisfactory to
all good men: that they would not suffer themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be misled; nor give advantage to enemies, and ill-designing
persons, ready to seize every opportunity o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
embroiling the government. He gave them to understand
that his necessary absence had occasioned the late adjourn∣ment;
but as soon as God should bring him back, thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
parliament should be assembled. Even this explanation, se∣conded
by all the credit and address of his ministers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
failed in allaying the national ferment, which rose to the
very verge of rebellion.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The King, who, from his first accession to
the throne, had veered occasionally from one party to
another, according to the circumstances of his affairs
and the opposition he encountered, was at this period <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
incensed and embarrassed by the caprice and insolence o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Commons, that he willingly lent an ear to the leader<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Tories, who undertook to manage the Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
according to his pleasure, provided he would part wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
some of his ministers, who were peculiarly odious to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Commons. The person against whom their anger was chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
directed, was the Lord Chancellor Somers the most a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tive
leader of the Whig-party. They demanded hjs di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mission,
and the King exhorted him to resign his office<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but he refusing to take any step that might indicate a se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of his enemies, or a consciousness of guilt, the King se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a peremptory order for the seals by the Lord Jersey, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
whom Somers delivered them without hesitation. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were successively offered to Lord-Chief-Justice Holt, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>
Trevor, the attorney-general, who declined accepting such
a precarious office. Meanwhile, the King granted a tem∣porary
commission to three judges to sit in the Court of
Chancery; and at length bestowed the seals, with the
title of Lord Keeper, on Nathan Wright, one of the ser∣jeants
at law, a man but indifferently qualified for the
office to which he was now preferred. Though William
seemed altogether attached to the Tories, and inclined
to a new Parliament, no person appeared to take the lead
in the affairs of government; and, indeed for some time
the administration seemed to be under no particular di∣rection.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. During the transactions of the last session,
the negociation for a second partition-treaty had been car∣ried
on in London by the French minister, Tallard, in
conjunction with the Earls of Portland and Jersey, and
was soon brought to perfection. On the twenty-first day
of February the treaty was signed in London; and on
the twenty-fifth of the next month it was subscribed at
the Hague by Briord, the French envoy, and the pleni∣potentiaries
of the States-General. By this convention
the treaty of Ryswick was confirmed. The contracting
parties agreed, that, in case of his Catholick Majesty's
dying without issue, the Dauphin should possess, for
himself and his heirs, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily,
the islands of St. Stephano, Porto Hercole, Orbitello,
Telamone, Porto Longone, Piombino, the city and mar∣quisate
of Final, the province of Guipuscoa, the duchies
of Lorraine and Bar, in exchange for which last, the Duke
of Lorraine should enjoy the duchy of Milan; but that
the county of Biche should remain in sovereignty to the
Prince of Vaudemont: that the Archduke Charles should
inherit the kingdom of Spain and all its dependencies in
and out of Europe; but, in case of his dying without
issue, it should devolve to some other child of the Emperor,
except him who might succeed as Emperor or King of
the Romans: that this monarchy should never descend to
a King of France or Dauphin; and that three months
<PB N="352" REF="358"/>
should be allowed to the Emperor, to consider whether or
not he would accede to this treaty. Whether the French
King was really sincere in his professions at this juncture,
or proposed this treaty with a view to make a clandestine
use of it at the court of Spain for more interested purpo∣ses,
it is not easy to determine: at first, however, it was
concealed from the notice of the publick, as if the parties
had resolved to take no step in consequence of it, during
the life of his Catholick Majesty.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. In the beginning of July the King embarked
for Holland, after having appointed a regency to govern
the kingdom in his absence. On the twenty-ninth day of
the same month, the young Duke of Gloucester, the only
remaining child of seventeen which the Princess Anne
had bor'n, died of a malignant fever, in the eleventh
year of his age. His death was much lamented by the
greater part of the English nation, not only on account of
his promising talents and gentle behaviour, but also, as it
left the succession undetermined, and might create disputes
of fatal consequence to the nation. The Jacobites openly
exulted in an event which they imagined would remove
the chief bar to the interest of the Prince of Wales:
but the protestants generally turned their eyes upon the
Princess Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover, and
grand-daughter of James I. It was with a view to concert
the establishment of her succession, that the court of
Brunswick now returned the visit of King William.
The present state of affairs in England, however, afforded
a very uncomfortable prospect. The people were gene∣rally
alienated from the person and government of the
reigning king, upon whom they seem to have surfeited.
The vigour of their minds was destroyed by luxury and
sloth: the severity of their morals was relaxed by a long
habit of venality and corruption. The King's health
began to decline, and even his faculties decayed apace.
No person was appointed to ascend the throne when it
should become vacant. The Jacobite faction alone was
eager, vigilant, enterprising, and elate. They dis∣patched
Mr. Graham, brother of Lord Preston, to the
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
court of St. Germain's, immediately after the death of the
Duke of Gloucester: they began to bestir themselves all
over the kingdom. A report was spread that the Princess
Anne had privately sent a message to her father; and
Britain was once more threatened with civil war, con∣fusion,
anarchy, and ruin.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. In the mean time, King William was not
inactive. The Kings of Denmark and Poland, with the
Elector of Brandenburgh, had formed a league to crush
the young King of Sweden, by invading his dominions on
different sides. The Poles actually entered Livonia, and
undertook the siege of Riga: the King of Denmark having
demolished some forts in Holstein, the Duke of which was
connected with Sweden, invested Tonninghen. The
Swedish minister in England demanded that assistance of
William which had been stipulated in a late renewal of
the ancient treaty between England and Sweden. The
States of Holland were sollicited to the same purpose.
Accordingly, a fleet of thirty sail, English and Dutch,
was sent to the Baltick, under the command of Sir
George Rooke, who joined the Swedish squadron, and
bombarded Copenhagen, to which the Danish fleet had
retired. At the same time, the Duke of Lunenbourg,
with the Swedish forces, which happened to be at Bre∣men,
passed the Elbe, and marched to the assistance of
the Duke of Holstein. The Danes immediately aban∣doned
the siege of Tonninghen; and a body of Saxons,
who had made an irruption into the territories of the
Duke of Brunswick, were obliged to retreat in disorder.
By the mediation of William, a negociation was begun
for a treaty between Sweden and Denmark, which, in
order to quicken, Charles the young King of Sweden
made a descent upon the isle of Zealand. This was ex∣ecuted
with great success. Charles was the first man
who landed; and here he exhibited such marks of cou∣rage
and conduct, far above his years, as equally astonish∣ed
and intimidated his adversaries. Then he determined
to besiege Copenhagen; a resolution that struck such
<PB N="354" REF="360"/>
terrour into the Danes, that they proceeded with re∣doubled
diligence in the treaty, which was brought to a
conclusion, between Denmark, Sweden, and Holstein,
about the middle of August. Then the Swedes retired
to Schonen, and the squadrons of the maritime powers
returned from the Baltick.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. When the new partition treaty was com∣municated
by the ministers of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tracting parties to
the other powers of Europe, it generally met with a very
unfavourable construction. Saxony and the northern
crowns were still embroiled with their own quarrels,
consequently could not give much attention to such a
remote transaction. The Princes of Germany appeared
cautious and dilatory in their answers, unwilling to be
concerned in any plan that might excite the resentment
of the House of Austria. The Elector of Brandenburgh,
in particular, had set his heart upon the regal dignity,
which he hoped to obtain from the favour and authority
of the Emperor. The Italian states were averse to the
partition-treaty, from their apprehension of seeing France
in possession of Naples, and other districts of their country.
The Duke of Savoy affected a mysterious neutrality, in
hopes of being able to barter his consent for some consider∣able
advantage. The Swiss cantons declined acceding as
guarantees. The Emperor expressed his astonishment
that any disposition should be made of the Spanish mo∣narchy
without the consent of the present possessor, and
the states of the kingdom. He observed, that neither
justice nor decorum could warrant the contracting powers
to compel him, who was the rightful heir, to accept a
part of his inheritance within three months, under pe∣nalty
of forfeiting even that share to a third person not yet
named; and he declared, that he could take no final re∣solution,
until he should know the sentiments of his Ca∣tholick
Majesty, on an affair in which their mutual interest
was so nearly concerned. Leopold was actually engaged
in a negociation with the King of Spain, who signed a
will in favour of his second son Charles: yet he took no
<PB N="355" REF="361"/>
measures to support the disposition, either by sending the
Archduke with a sufficient force into Spain, or by de∣taching
troops into Italy.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The people of Spain were exasperated at
the insolence of the three foreign powers who pretended to
parcel out their dominions. Their pride took the alarm,
at the prospect of their monarchy's being dismembered;
and the grandees repined at the thought of losing so many
lucrative governments, which they now enjoyed. The
King's life became every day more and more precarious,
from frequent returns of his disorder. The ministry was
weak and divided, the nobility factious, and the people
discontented. The hearts of the nation had been alienated
from the house of Austria, by the insolent carriage and
rapacious disposition of the Queen Mariana. The French
had gained over to their interests the Cardinal Portocarre∣ro,
the Marquis de Monterey, with many other noblemen
and persons of distinction. These, perceiving the senti∣ments
of the people, employed their emissaries to raise a
general cry that France alone could maintain the succes∣sion
entire: that the house of Austria was feeble and ex∣hausted,
and any prince of that line must owe his chief
support to detestable hereticks. Portocarrero tampered
with the weakness of his sovereign. He repeated and ex∣aggerated
all these suggestions: he advised him to consult
Pope Innocent XII. on this momentous point of regu∣lating
the succession. That pontiff, who was a creature
of France, having taken the advice of a college of cardi∣nals,
determined that the renunciation of Maria The∣resa
was invalid and null, as being founded upon com∣pulsion,
and contrary to the fundamental laws of the
Spanish monarchy. He, therefore, exhorted King Charles
to contribute to the propagation of the faith, and the re∣pose
of Christendom, by making a new will in favour of
a grandson of the French monarch. This admonition
was seconded by the remonstrances of Portocarrero; and
the weak prince complied with the proposal. In the mean
time, the King of France seemed to act heartily, as a
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
principal in the treaty of partition. His ministers at foreign
courts co-operated with those of the maritime powers, in
solliciting the accession of the different potentates in Eu∣rope.
When Count Zinzendorf, the Imperial ambassa∣dor
at Paris, presented a memorial, desiring to know what
part France would act, should the King of Spain volun∣tarily
place a grandson of Louis upon the throne, the
Marquis de Torcy answered in writing, that his Most
Christian Majesty would by no means listen to such a pro∣posal:
nay, when the Emperor's minister gave them to
understand that his master was ready to begin a separate
negociation with the court of Versailles, touching the
Spanish succession, Louis declared he could not treat on
that subject without the concurrence of his allies.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The nature of the partition-treaty was no
sooner known in England, than condemned by the most
intelligent part of the nation. They first of all complained,
that such an important affair should be concluded without
the advice of parliament. They observed, that the scheme
was unjust, and the execution of it hazardous: that, in
concerting the terms, the maritime powers seemed to have
acted as partisans of France; for the possession of Naples
and the Tuscan ports would subject Italy to her dominion,
and interfere with the English trade to the Levant and
Mediterranean; while Guipuscoa, on any future rupture,
would afford another inlet into the heart of the Spanish
dominions: they, for these reasons, pronounced the
treaty destructive of the balance of power, and prejudicial
to the interest of England. All these arguments were
trumpeted by the malcontents, so that the whole king∣dom
echoed with the clamour of disaffection. Sir Christo∣pher
Musgrave, and others of the Tory faction, began to
think in earnest of establishing the succession of the Eng∣lish
crown upon the person of the Prince of Wales. They
are said to have sent over Mr. Graham to St. Germain's
with overtures to this purpose, and an assurance that a
motion would be made in the House of Commons, to pass
a vote that the crown should not be supported in the exe∣cution
<PB N="357" REF="363"/>
of the partition-treaty. King William was not
ignorant of the censure he had undergone, and not a little
alarmed to find himself so unpopular among his own
subjects. That he might be the more able to bestow his
attention effectually upon the affairs of England, he re∣solved
to take some measures for the satisfaction of the
Scottish nation. He permitted the parliament of that
kingdom to meet on the twenty-eighth day of October, and
wrote a letter to them from his house at Loo, containing
an assurance that he would concur in every thing that
could be reasonably proposed for maintaining and advanc∣ing
the peace and welfare of their kingdom. He promised
to give his royal assent to such acts as they should frame for
the better establishment of the presbyterian discipline; for
preventing the growth of popery, suppressing vice and im∣morality,
encouraging piety and virtue, preserving and
securing personal liberty, regulating and advancing trade,
retrieving the losses, and promoting the interest of their
African and Indian companies. He expressed his concern
that he could not assert the company's right of establishing
a colony at Darien, without disturbing the peace of
Christendom, and entailing a ruinous war on that his an∣cient
kingdom. He recommended unanimity and dispatch
in raising competent taxes for their own defence; and told
them he had thought fit to continue the Duke of Queens∣berry
in the office of high-commissioner. Notwithstand∣ing
this soothing address, the national resentment conti∣nued
to rage, and the parliament seemed altogether in∣tractable.
By this time the company had received certain
tidings of the entire surrender of their settlement; and,
on the first day of the session, they represented to parlia∣ment,
that for want of due protection abroad, some persons
had been encouraged to break in upon their privileges even
at home. This remonstrance was succeeded by another
national address to the King, who told them he could not
take any further notice of that affair, since the parliament
was now assembled; and he had already made a declaration,
with which he hoped all his faithful subjects would be
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
satisfied. Nevertheless, he found it absolutely necessary
to practise other expedients for allaying the ferment of
that nation. His ministers and their agents bestirred
themselves so successfully, that the heats in parliament
were entirely cooled, and the outcry of the people subsided
into unavailing murmurs. The parliament resolved, That
in consideration of their great deliverance by his Majesty;
and, as next under God, their safety and happiness wholly
depended on his preservation and that of his government,
they would support both to the utmost of their power, and
maintain such forces as should be requisite for those ends.
They passed an act for keeping on foot three thousand men
for two years, to be maintained by a land-tax. Then the
commissioner produced the King's letter, desiring to have
eleven hundred men on his own account to the first day of
June following: they forthwith complied with his request,
and were prorogued to the sixth of May. The supernu∣merary
troops were sent over to the States-General; and
the Earl of Argyle was honoured with the title of duke,
as a recompense for having concurred with the commis∣sioner
in managing this session of parliament.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. King William had returned to England
on the eighteenth day of October, not a little chagrined
at the perplexities in which he found himself involved;
and, in the beginning of the next month, he received
advice that the King of Spain was actually dead. He could
not be surprised at this event, which had been so long ex∣pected;
but it was attended with a circumstance which he
had not foreseen. Charles, by his last will, had declared
the Duke of Anjou, second son of the Dauphin, the sole
heir of the Spanish monarchy. In case this prince should
die without issue, or inherit the crown of France, he willed
that Spain should devolve to the Duke of Berry; in de∣fault
of him, and children, to the Archduke Charles and
his heirs; failing of whom, to the Duke of Savoy and his
posterity. He likewise recommended a match between the
Duke of Anjou, and one of the Archduchesses. When
this testament was first notified to the French court, Louis
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>
seemed to hesitate between his inclination and engage∣ments
to William and the Sates-General. Madame de
Maintenon is said to have joined her influence to that of
the Dauphin, in persuading the King to accept of the
will; and Pontchartrain was engaged to support the same
measure. A cabinet-council was called in her apartment.
The rest of the ministry declared for the treaty of parti∣tion:
the King affected a kind of neutrality. The
Dauphin spoke for his son, with an air of resolution he
had never assumed before: Pontchartrain seconded his
arguments: Madame de Maintenon asked what the Duke
of Anjou had done to provoke the King, that he should
be barred of his right to that succession? Then the
rest of the members espoused the Dauphin's opinion;
and the King owned himself convinced by their reasons.
In all probability, the decision of this council was pre∣viously
settled in private. After the will was accepted,
Louis closetted the Duke of Anjou, to whom he said, in
presence of the Marquis des Rios, “Sir, the King of
Spain has made you a king. The grandees demand
you; the people wish for you, and I give my consent.
Remember only, you are a prince of France. I recom∣mend
to you to love your people, to gain their affec∣tion
by the lenity of your government, and to render
yourself worthy of the throne you are going to ascend.”
The new monarch was congratulated on this elevation by
all the princes of the blood: nevertheless, the Duke of
Orleans and his son protested against the will, because the
Archduke was placed next in succession to the Duke of
Berry, in bar of their right as descendents of Anne of
Austria, whose renunciation could be of no more force
than that of Maria-Theresa. On the fourth day of De∣cember,
the new king set out for Spain, to the frontiers
of which he was accompanied by his two brothers.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. When the will was accepted, the French
minister De Torcy endeavoured to justify his master's
conduct to the Earl of Manchester, who resided at Paris
in the character of ambassador from the court of London.
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
He observed, That the treaty of partition was not likely
to answer the ends for which it had been concerted:
That the Emperor had refused to accede: That it was
relished by none of the princes to whom it had been com∣municated:
That the people of England and Holland had
expressed their discontent at the prospect of France's being
in possession of Naples and Sicily: That if Louis had
rejected the will, the Archduke would have had a double
title derived from the former will, and that of the late
king: That the Spaniards were so averse to the division of
their monarchy, there would be a necessity for conquering
the whole kingdom before the treaty could be executed:
That the ships to be furnished by Great Britain and Hol∣land
would not be sufficient for the purposes of such a
war; and it was doubtful whether England and the States-General
would engage themselves in a greater expense.
He concluded with saying, That the treaty would have
been more advantageous to France than the will, which
the King accepted purely from a desire of preserving the
peace of Europe. His master hoped, therefore, the good
understanding would subsist between him and the King of
Great-Britain. The same reasons were communicated by
Briod, the French ambassador at the Hague, to the States-General.
Notwithstanding this address, they ordered their
envoy at Paris to deliver a memorial to the French King,
expressing their surprise at his having accepted the will;
and their hope, that as the time specified for the Emperor's
acceding to the treaty was not expired, his Most Christian
Majesty would take the affair again into his consideration,
and adhere to his engagements in every article. Louis, in
his answer to this memorial, which he dispatched to all the
courts of Europe, declared, That what he chiefly consi∣dered
was the principal design of the contracting parties,
namely the maintenance of peace in Europe; and that,
true to this principle, he only departed from the words,
that he might the better adhere to the spirit of the treaty.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. With this answer he sent a letter to the
States, giving them to understand, that the peace of Eu∣rope
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
was so firmly established by the will of the King of
Spain, in favour of his grandson, that he did not doubt
their approbation of his succession to the Spanish crown.
The States observed, That they could not declare them∣selves
upon an affair of such consequence, without con∣sulting
their respective provinces. Louis admitted the
excuse, and assured them of his readiness to concur with
whatever they should desire for the security of the Spanish
Netherlands. The Spanish ambassador of the Hague
presented them with a letter from his new master, who
likewise notified his accession to all the powers of Europe,
except the King of England. The Emperor loudly ex∣claimed
against the will, as being more iniquitous than
the treaty of partition; and threatened to do himself
justice by force of arms. The Spaniards apprehending
that a league would be formed between his Imperial Ma∣jesty
and the maritime powers, for setting aside the suc∣cession
of the Duke of Anjou; and, conscious of their
own inability to defend their dominions, resigned them∣selves
entirely to the protection of the French monarch.
The towns in the Spanish Netherlands and the duchy of
Milan admitted French garrisons: a French squadron
anchored in the port of Cadiz; and another was detached
to the Spanish settlements in the West-Indies. Part of
the Dutch army that was quartered in Luxembourg, Mons,
and Namur were made prisoners of war, because they
would not own the King of Spain, whom their masters
had not yet acknowledged. The States were overwhelmed
with consternation by this event, especially when they
considered their own naked situation, and reflected that
the Spanish garrisons might fall upon them before they
could assemble a body of troops for their defence. The
danger was so imminent, that they resolved to acknow∣ledge
the King of Spain without further hesitation, and
wrote a letter to the French King for that purpose: this
was no sooner received, than orders were issued for send∣ing
back their battalions.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="368"/>
§ XL. How warmly soever King William resented the
conduct of the French King, in accepting the will so dia∣metrically
opposite to his engagements, he dissembled his
chagrin, and behaved with such reserve and apparent in∣difference,
that some people naturally believed he had
been privy to the transaction. Others imagined that he
was discouraged from engaging in a new war by his
bodily infirmities, which daily increased, as well as by the
opposition in parliament, to which he should be inevitably
exposed. But his real aim was to conceal his sentiments,
until he should have sounded the opinions of other powers
in Europe, and seen how far he could depend upon his
new ministry. He now seemed to repose his chief confi∣dence
in the Earl of Rochester, who had undertaken for
the Tories, and was declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland.
Lord Godolphin was appointed first commissioner of the
Treasury: Lord Tankerville succeeded Lord Lonsdale,
lately deceased, as keeper of the privy-seal, and Sir
Charles Hedges was declared secretary of state, in the
room of the Earl of Jersey: but the management of the
Commons was entrusted to Mr. Robert Harley, who had
hitherto opposed the measures of the court with equal viru∣lence
and ability. These new undertakers, well knowing
they should find it very difficult, if not impossible, to se∣cure
a majority in the present parliament, prevailed on
the King to dissolve it by proclamation: then the sheriffs
were changed according to their nomination, and writs
issued for a new parliament to meet on the sixth day of
February. During this interval, Count Wratislaw ar∣rived
in England, as ambassador from the Emperor, to
explain Leopold's title to the Spanish monarchy, sup∣ported
by repeated entails and renunciations, confirmed in
the most solemn treaties. This minister met with a very
cold reception from those who stood at the helm of affairs.
They sought to avoid all connexions that might engage
their country as a principal in another war upon the
continent, smarting as they were for the losses and in∣cumbrances
which the last had entailed upon them and
<PB N="363" REF="369"/>
their posterity. They seemed to think that Louis, rather
than involve himself in fresh troubles, would give all the
security that could be desired for maintaining the peace of
Europe; or even, should this be refused, they saw no reason
for Britain's exhausting her wealth and strength to support
a chimerical balance, in which her interest was but re∣motely
concerned. It was their opinion, that by keeping
aloof, she might render herself more respectable. Her
reserve would over-awe contending powers: they would in
their turn sue for her assistance, and implore her good offices;
and, instead of declaring herself a party, she would have
the honour to decide as arbitress of their disputes. Perhaps
they extended this idea too far; and, in all probability,
their notions were enflamed by a spirit of faction. They
hated the Whigs as their political adversaries, and detested
the war, because it had been countenanced and supported
by the interest of that party. The King believed, that a
conjunction of the two monarchies of France and Spain
would prove fatal to the liberties of Europe; and that this
could not be prevented by any other method than a general
union of the other European powers. He certainly was an
enthusiast in his sentiments of this equilibrium; and fully
convinced that he himself, of all the potentates in Christen∣dom,
was the only prince capable of adjusting the balance.
The Imperial ambassador could not, therefore, be long
ignorant of his real purpose, as he conversed with the
Dutch favourites, who knew and approved of their master's
design, though he avoided a declaration, until he should
have rendered his ministers more propitious to his aim.
The true secret, however, of that reserve with which
Count Wratislaw was treated at his first arrival, was a pri∣vate
negociation which the King had set on foot with the
regency of Spain, touching a barrier in the Netherlands.
He proposed, that certain towns should be garrisoned with
English and Dutch troops, by way of security against the
ambitious designs of France: but the regency were so de∣voted
to the French interest, that they refused to listen to
any proposal of this nature. While this affair was in
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
agitation, William resolved to maintain a wary distan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from the Emperor; but, when his effort miscarried
the ambassador found him much more open and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cessible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was distinguished by a glorious victory which the young King of Sweden obtained in the nineteenth year of his age. Riga continued invested by the King of Poland, while Peter the Czar of Muscovy made his approaches to Narva, at the head of a prodigious army, purposing, in violation of all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith and justice, to share the spoils of the youthful monarch. Charles landed at Revel, compelled the Saxons to abandon the siege of Rig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and having sup∣plied the place, marched with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andful of troops against the Muscovites, who had undertaken the siege of Narva. The Czar quitted his army with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me precipitation, as if he had been afraid of hazarding his person, while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advanced through ways that were thought impracticable, and surprised the enemy. He broke into their camp before they had the least intimation of his approach, and totally routed them, after a short resistance. He took a great number of prisoners, with all their baggage, tents, and artillery, and entered Narva in triumph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The parliament meeting on the sixth, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prorogued to the tenth day of February, when Mr. Harle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was chosen Speaker by a great majority, in opposition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Sir Richard Onslow. The King had previously told Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Thomas Lyttelton, it would be for his service that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should yield his pretensions to Harley at this juncture; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that gentleman agreed to absent himself from the House o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the day of election. The King observed, in his speech
That the nation's loss in the death of the Duke of Glou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester
had rendered it absolutely necessary for them t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
make further provision for the succession of the crown i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the protestant line: That the death of the King of Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had made such an alteration in the affairs of the continent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as required their mature deliberation. The rest of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
harangue turned upon the usual topicks of demanding sup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plies
for the ensuing year, reminding them of the defici∣encies
and publick debts, recommending to their enquiry
the state of the navy and fortifications; exhorting them
to encourage commerce, employ the poor, and proceed
with vigour and unanimity in all their deliberations.
Though the elections had been generally carried in favour
of the Tory interest, the ministry had secured but one part
of that faction. Some of the most popular leaders, such
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
as the Duke of Leeds, the Marquis of Normanby, the
Earl of Nottingham, Seymour, Musgrave, How, Finch,
and Showers, had been either neglected or found refrac∣tory,
and resolved to oppose the court-measures with all
their influence. Besides, the French King, knowing that
the peace of Europe would in a great measure depend on
the resolutions of the English parliament, is said to have
distributed great sums of money in England, by means of
his minister, Tallard, in order to strengthen the opposition
in the House of Commons. Certain it is, the nation
abounded, at this period, with the French coins called
Louis d'or and pistoles; but whether this redundancy was
owing to a balance of trade in favour of England, or to
the largesses of Louis, we shall not pretend to determine.
We may likewise observe, that the infamous practice of
bribing electors had never been so flagrant as in the choice
of representatives for this parliament. This scandalous traf∣fick
had been chiefly carried on by the Whig party, and,
therefore, their antagonists resolved to spare no pains in
detecting their corruption. Sir Edward Seymour distin∣guished
himself by his zeal and activity: he brought some
of these practices to light, and, in particular, stigmatized
the new East-India company, for having been deeply con∣cerned
in this species of venality. An enquiry being set
on foot in the House of Commons, several elections were
declared void; and, divers persons who had been illegally
returned, were first expelled the House, and afterwards
detained in prison. Yet these prosecutions were carried
on with such partiality, as plainly indicated that they
flowed rather from party zeal than from patriotism.</P>
<P>§ XLII. A great body of the Commons had resolved
to present an address to his Majesty, desiring he would
acknowledge the King of Spain; and the motion, in all
probability, would have been carried by a considerable
majority, had not one bold and lucky expression given
such a turn to the debate, as induced the anti-courtiers to
desist. One Mr. Moncton, in the heat of his declama∣tion
against this measure, said, he expected the next vote
<PB N="366" REF="372"/>
would be for owning the pretended Prince of Wales▪
Though there was little or no connexion between these
two subjects, a great many members were startled at the
insinuation, and deserted the measure, which was dropped
accordingly. The King's speech being taken into con∣sideration,
the House resolved to support his Majesty and
his government; to take such effectual measures as might
best conduce to the interest and safety of England, and
the preservation of the protestant religion. This resolu∣tion
was presented in an address to the King, who re∣ceived
it favourably. At the same time, he laid before
them a memorial he had received from the States-General,
and desired their advice and assistance in the points that
constituted the substance of this remonstrance. The
States gave him to understand, that they had acknow∣ledged
the Duke of Anjou as King of Spain: that France
had agreed to a negociation, in which they might stipu∣late
the necessary conditions for securing the peace of Eu∣rope;
and, that they were firmly resolved to do nothing
without the concurrence of his Majesty and their other
allies. They, therefore, begged he would send a minister
to the Hague, with necessary powers and instructions to
co-operate with them in this negociation: he told them
that, in case it should prove ineffectual, or Holland be
suddenly invaded by the troops which Louis had ordered
to advance towards their frontiers, they relied on the as∣sistance
of England, and hoped his Majesty would prepare
the succours stipulated by treaty to be used, should occa∣sion
require. The memorial was likewise communicated
to the House of Lords. Mean while, the Commons de∣sired
that the treaties between England and the States-General
should be laid before their House. These being
perused, they resolved upon an address, to desire his Ma∣jesty
would enter into such negociations with the States-General,
and other potentates, as might most effectually
conduce to the mutual safety of Great-Britain and the
United-Provinces, as well as to the preservation of the
peace of Europe and to assure him of their support and
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
assistance, in performance of the treaty subsisting between
England and the States-General. This resolution, how∣ever,
was not carried without great opposition from those
who were averse to the nation's involving itself in another
war upon the continent. The King professed himself ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remely
well pleased with this address, and told them he
would immediately order his ministers abroad to act in
concert with the States-General and other powers, for
the attainment of those ends they proposed.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. He communicated to the Commons a letter
written by the Earl of Melfort to his brother the Earl of
Perth, governor to the pretended Prince of Wales. It had
been mislaid by accident, and came to London in the
French mail. It contained a scheme for another invasion
of England, together with some reflections on the cha∣racter
of the Earl of Middleton, who had supplanted him
at the Court of St. Germain's. Melfort was a mere pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector,
and seems to have had no other view than that of
recommending himself to King James, and bringing his
rival into disgrace. The House of Lords, to whom the
letter was also imparted, ordered it to be printed. Next
day they presented an address, thanking his Majesty for
his care of the protestant religion; desiring all the treaties
made since the last war might be laid before them; re∣questing
him to engage in such alliances as he should think
proper, for preserving the balance of power in Europe:
assuring him of their concurrence; expressing their ac∣knowledgement
for his having communicated Melfort's
letter; desiring he would give orders for seising the horses
and arms of disaffected persons; for removing papists from
London; and for searching after those arms and provisions
of war mentioned in the letter: finally, they requested him
to equip speedily a sufficient fleet for the defence of him∣self
and his kingdom. They received a gracious answer to
this address, which was a further encouragement to the
King to put his own private designs in execution: towards
the same end the letter contributed not a little, by inflam∣ing
the fears and resentment of the nation against France,
<PB N="368" REF="374"/>
which in vain disclaimed the Earl of Melfort as a fantasti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cal
schemer, to whom no regard was paid at the court <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Versailles. The French ministry complained of the publi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cation
of this letter, as an attempt to sow jealousy betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the two crowns; and, as a convincing proof of their sin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerity,
banished the Earl of Melsort to Angers.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The credit of Exchequer bills was so lowere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by the change of the ministry, and the lapse of the tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
allotted for their circulation, that they fell near twenty
per cent. to the prejudice of the revenue, and the discre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dit
of the government in foreign countries. The Common
having taken this affair into consideration, voted, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
provision should be made from time to time for making
good the principal and interest due on all parliamentary
funds; and afterwards passed a bill for renewing the bill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of credit, commonly called Exchequer bills. This was sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
up to the Lords on the sixth day of March, and on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thirteenth received the royal assent. The next object tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
engrossed the attention of the Commons was the settlemen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the succession to the throne, which the King had re∣commended
to their consideration in the beginning of the
session. Having deliberated on this subject, they resolved▪
That for the preservation of the peace and happiness of
the kingdom, and the security of the protestant religion▪
it was absolutely necessary that a further declaration should
be made of the limitation and succession of the crown in
the protestant line, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter his Majesty and the Princess, and
the heirs of their bodies respectively: and, That further
provision should be first made for the security of the rights
and liberties of the people. Mr. Harley moved, That
some conditions of government might be settled as preli∣minaries,
before they should proceed to the nomination of
the person, that their security might be complete. Accord∣ingly,
they deliberated on this subject, and agreed to the
following resolutions: That whoever shall hereafter com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the possession of this crown, shall join in communion
with the church of England as by law established: That<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in case the crown and imperial dignity of this realm shal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="369" REF="375"/>
hereafter come to any person, not being a native of this
kingdom of England, this nation be not obliged to engage
in any war for the defence of any dominions or territories
which do not belong to the crown of England, without the
consent of parliament: That no person who shall here∣after
come to the possession of the crown shall go out of
the dominions of England, Scotland, or Ireland, without
consent of parliament: That, from and after the time
that the further limitation by this act shall take effect, all
matters and things relating to the well governing of this
kingdom, which are properly cognizable in the privy-coun∣cil,
by the laws and customs of the realm, shall be trans∣acted
there, and all resolutions taken thereupon shall be
signed by such of the privy-council as shall advise and con∣sent
to the same: That after the limitation shall take effect,
no person born out of the kingdom of England, Scotland,
or Ireland, or the dominions thereunto belonging, altho'
he be naturalized, and made a denizen (except such as are
born of English parents) shall be capable to be of the privy∣council,
or a member of either House of parliament, or to
enjoy any office or place of trust, either civil or military,
or to have any grant of lands, tenements, or hereditaments
from the crown to himself, or to any others in trust for
him: That no person who has an office or place of profit
under the King, or receives a pension from the crown, shall
be capable of serving as member of the House of Commons:
That after the limitation shall take effect, judges com∣missions
be made <HI>quamdiu se bene gesserint,</HI> and their sala∣ries
ascertained and established; but, upon the address of
both Houses of Parliament, it may be lawful to remove
them: That no pardon under the great seal of England be
pleadable to animpeachment by the Commons in parliament.
Having settled these preliminaries, they resolved, That the
Princess Sophia, Duchess Dowager of Hanover, be declared
the next in succession to the crown of England, in the pro∣testant
line, after his Majesty, and the Princess, and the heirs
of their bodies respectively: and, That the further limitation
of the crown be to the said Princess Sophia and the heirs of her
<PB N="370" REF="376"/>
body, being protestants. A blll being formed on these
resolutions, was sent up to the House of Lords, where it
met with some opposition from the Marquis of Normanby:
a protest was likewise entered against it by the Earls of
Huntingdon and Plymouth, and the Lords Guildford and
Jeffries. Nevertheless, it passed without amendments,
and on the twelfth day of June received the royal assent:
the King was extremely mortified at the preliminary limi∣tations,
which he considered as an open insult on his own
conduct and administration: not but that they were ne∣cessary
precautions, naturally suggested by the experience
of those evils to which the nation had been already exposed,
in consequence of raising a foreign prince to the throne of
England. As the Tories lay under the imputation of favour∣ing
the late King's interest, they exerted themselves zea∣lously
on this occasion, to wipe off the aspersion, and in∣finuate
themselves into the confidence of the people;
hoping, that in the sequel they should be able to restrain
the nation from engaging too deep in the affairs of the con∣tinent,
without incurring the charge of disaffection to the
present King and government. The act of settlement being
passed, the Earl of Macclesfield was sent to notify the
transaction to the Electress Sophia, who likewise received
from his hands the order of the garter.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The act of succession gave umbrage to all the
popish princes who were more nearly related to the crown
than his lady, whom the parliament had preferred to all
others. The Duchess of Savoy, grand-daughter to King
Charles I. by her mother, ordered her ambassador, Count
Maffei, to make a protestation to the parliament of Eng∣land,
in her name, against all resolutions and decisions
contrary to her title, as sole daughter to the Princess
Henrietta, next in succession to the crown of England,
after King William and the Princess Anne of Denmark.
Two copies of this protest Massei sent in letters to the
Lord Keeper and the Speaker of the Lower House, by two
of his gentlemen, and a public notary to attest the delive∣ry:
but no notice was taken of the declaration. The Duke
<PB N="371" REF="377"/>
of Savoy, while his minister was thus employed in England,
engaged in an alliance with the crowns of France and Spain,
on condition, That his Catholic Majesty should espouse
his youngest daughter without a dowry: That he himself
should command the allied army in Italy, and furnish eight
thousand infantry, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h five and twenty hundred horse, in
consideration of a monthly subsidy of fifty thousand crowns.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. During these transactions, Mr. Stanhope, en∣voy
extraordinary to the States-General, was empowered
to treat with the ministers of France and Spain, according
to the addresses of both Houses of parliament. He repre∣sented,
that though his Most Christian Majesty had
thought fit to deviate from the partition-treaty, it was not
reasonable that the King of England should lose the effect
of that convention: he, therefore, expected some security
for the peace of Europe; and for that purpose insisted
upon certain articles, importing, That the French King
should immediately withdraw his troops from the Spanish
Netherlands: That for the security of England, the ci∣ties
of Ostend and Nieuport should be delivered into the
hands of his Britannick Majesty: That no kingdom,
provinces, cities, lands, or places, belonging to the crown of
Spain, should ever be yielded or transferred to the crown of
France, on any pretence whatever: That the subjects of his
Britannick Majesty should retain all the privileges, rights, and
immunities, with regard to their navigation and commerce
in the dominions of Spain, which they enjoyed at the death
of his late Catholick Majesty; and also all such immunities,
rights, and franchises, as the subjects of France, or any
other power, either possess for the present, or may enjoy
for the future: That all treaties of peace and conventions
between England and Spain, should be renewed: and
That a treaty formed on these demands should be guaran∣tied
by such powers as one or other of the contractors should
solicit and prevail upon to accede. Such likewise were
the proposals made by the States-General, with this differ∣ence,
that they demanded, as cautionary towns, all the
strongest places in the Netherlands. Count D'Avaux, the
<PB N="372" REF="378"/>
French minister was so surprised at these exorbitant de∣mands,
that he could not help saying, They could not
have been higher, if his master had lost four successive
battles. He assured them, that his Most Christian Majesty
would withdraw his troops from the Spanish Netherlands
as soon as the King of Spain should have forces of his
own sufficient to guard the country: with respect to the
other articles, he could give no other answer, but that
he would immediately transmit them to Versailles. Louis
was filled with indignation at the insolent strain of those
proposals, which he considered as a sure mark of Willi∣am's
hostile intentions. He refused to give any other secu∣rity
for the peace of Europe, than a renewal of the treaty
of Ryswick; and he is said to have tampered, by means
of his agents and emissaries, with the members of the
English parliament, that they might oppose all steps
tending to a new war on the continent.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. King William certainly had no expectation
that France would close with such proposals; but he was
not without hope, that her refusal would warm the English
nation into a concurrence with his designs. He commu∣nicated
to the House of Commons the demands which had
been made by him and the States-General; and gave them
to understand, that he would from time to time make them
acquainted with the progress of the negociation. The
Commons, suspecting that his intention was to make
them parties in a congress which he might conduct to a
different end from that which they proposed, resolved to
signify their sentiments in the answer to this message.
They called for the treaty of partition, which being read,
they voted an address of thanks to his Majesty, for his most
gracious declaration, that he would make them acquainted
with the progress of the negociation: but they signified
their disapprobation of the partition-treaty, signed with the
great seal of England, without the advice of the parlia∣ment
which was then sitting, and productive of ill con∣sequences
to the kingdom, as well as to the peace of Eu∣rope,
as it assigned over to the French King such a large
<PB N="373" REF="379"/>
portion of the Spanish dominions. Nothing could be more
mortifying to the King, than this open attack upon his
own conduct: yet he suppressed his resentment, and with∣out
taking the least notice of their sentiments with respect
to the partition-treaty, assured them, that he should be
always ready to receive their advice on the negociation
which he had set on foot, according to their desire. The
debates in the House of Commons upon the subject of the
partition treaty rose to such violence, that divers members
in declaring against it, transgressed the bounds of decency.
Sir Edward Seymour compared the division which had
been made of the Spanish territories to a robbery on the
highway; and Mr. Howe did not scruple to say it was a
felonious treaty: an expression, which the King resented
to such a degree, that he declared he would have demanded
personal satisfaction with his sword, had not he been re∣strained
by the disparity of condition between himself and
the person who had offered such anoutrageous insult to his
honour: Whether the tories intended to alienate the
minds of the nation from all foreign connexions, or to
wreak their vengeance on the late ministers, whom they
hated as the chiefs of the Whig-party, certain it is, they
now raised an universal outcry against the partition-treaty,
which was not only condemned in publick-pamphlets and
private conversation, but even brought into the House of
Lords as an object of parliamentary censure. In the month
of March a warm debate on this subject was begun by
She<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field Marquis of Normanby, and carried on with great
vehemence by other noblemen of the same saction. They
exclaimed against the article by which so many territories
were added to the crown of France: they complained,
that the Emperor had been forsaken: that the treaty was
not communicated to the privy-council or ministry, but
clandestinely transacted by the Earls of Portland and Jer∣sey:
that the sanction of the great seal had been unjustly
and irregularly applied, sirst to blank powers, and after∣wards
to the treaty itself. The courtiers replied, that the
King had engaged in a treaty of partition at the desire of
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
the Emperor, who had agreed to every article, except that
relating to the duchy of Milan, and afterwards desired,
that his Majesty would procure sor him the best terms he
could obtain; above all things recommending secresy, that
he might not forfeit his interest in Spain, by seeming to
consent to the treaty: that foreign negociations being en∣trusted
to the care of the crown, the King lay under no
legal obligation to communicate such secrets of state to his
council; far less was he obliged to follow their advice:
and that the keeper of the great seal had no authority for
refusing to apply it to any powers or treaty which the King
should grant or conclude, unless they were contrary to
law, which had made no provision for such an emergency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this debate, the Earl of Rochester reprehended some lords for speaking disrespectfully of the French King, observing, that it was peculiarly incu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent on peers to treat monarchs with decorum and respect, as they derived their dignity from the crown. Another affirming, that the French King was not only to be respected, but likewise to be feared; a certain lord replied, “He hoped no man in England needed to be afraid of the French King, much less the Peer who spoke last, who was too much a friend to that monarch to fear any thing from his re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment.”</NOTE>.
The Earl of Portland, apprehending that this tempest
would burst upon his head, declared, on the second day
of the debate, that he had by the King's order communi∣cated
the treaty, before it was concluded, to the Earls of
Pembroke and Marlborough, the Lords Lonsdale, Somers,
Hallifax and secretary Vernon. These noblemen owned,
that they had been made acquainted with the substance of
it: that when they excepted to some particulars, they
were told, his Majesty had carried the matter as far as it
could be advanced, and that he could obtain no better
terms: thus assured that every article was already settled,
they said they no longer insisted upon particulars, but gave
their advice that his Majesty should not engage himself in
any measure that would produce a new war, seeing the na∣tion
had been souneasy under the last. After long debates,
and great variety as well as virulence of altercation, the
House agreed to an address, in which they disapproved of
the partition-treaty, as a scheme inconsistent with the
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>
peace and safety of Europe, as well as prejudicial to the
interest of Great-Britain. They complained, that neither
the instructions given to his plenipotentiaries, nor the
draft of the treaty itself, had been laid before his Majesty's
council. They humbly besought him, that for the future,
he would in all matters of importance, require and admit
the advice of his natural-born subjects of known probity
and fortune; and that he would constitute a council of
such persons, to whom he might impart all affairs which
should any way concern him and his dominions. They
observed, that interest and natural affection to their coun∣try
would incline them to every measure that might tend
to its welfare and prosperity; whereas strangers could not
be so much influenced by these considerations:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph. Voltair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> that their
knowledge of the country would render them more capable
than foreigners could be of advising his Majesty touching
the true interests of his kingdom: that they had exhibited
such repeated demonstrations of their duty and affection,
as must convince his Majesty of their zeal in his service;
nor could he want the knowledge of persons fit to be em∣ployed
in all his secret and arduous affairs: finally, as the
French King appeared to have violated the treaty of par∣tition,
they advised his Majesty, in future negociations
with that prince, to proceed with such caution as might
imply a real security.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. The King received this severe remonstrance
with his usual phlegm, saying, it contained matter of very
great moment; and he would take care that all treaties
he made should be for the honour and safety of England.
Though he deeply felt this affront, he would not alter his
conduct towards the new ministers: but, he plainly per∣ceived
their intention was to thwart him in his favourite
measure, and humble him into a dependence upon their
interest in parliament. On the last day of March, he im∣parted
to the Commons the French King's declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1701</NOTE>
that he would grant no other security than a renewal of
the treaty of Ryswick: so that the negociation seemed to
be at an end. He likewise communicated two resolutions
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>
of the States-General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1701.</NOTE> with a memorial from their envoy
in England, relating to the ships they had equipped with
a view to join the English fleet, and the succours stipulated
in the treaty concluded in the year 1677, which they de∣sired
might be sent over with all convenient expedition.
The House having considered this message, unanimously
resolved to desire his Majesty would carry on the negocia∣tions
in concert with the States-General, and take such
measures therein as might most conduce to their safety: they
assured him, they would effectually enable him to support
the treaty of 1677, by which England was bound to assist
them with ten thousand men, and twenty ships of war, in
case they should be attacked. Though the King was
nettled at that part of this address, which, by confining
him to one treaty, implied their disapprobation of a new
confederacy, he discovered no signs of emotion; but
thanked them for the assurance they had given, and told
them he had sent orders to his envoy at the Hague, to con∣tinue
the conferences with the courts of France and Spain.
On the nineteenth day of April, the Marquis de Torcy
delivered to the Earl of Manchester, at Paris, a letter from
the new King of Spain to his Britannick Majesty, notify∣ing
his accession to that throne, and expressing a desire of
cultivating a mutual friendship with the King and crown
of England. How averse soever William might have been
to any correspondence of this sort, the Earl of Rochester
and the new ministers importuned him in such a manner
to acknowledge Philip, that he at length complied with
their entreaties: and wrote a civil answer to his Most
Catholick Majesty. This was a very alarming incident to
the Emperor, who was bent upon a war with the two
crowns, and had determined to send Prince Eugene with
an army into Italy, to take possession of the duchy of
Milan, as a sie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the empire. The new Pope Clement
XI. who had succeeded to the papacy in the preceding
year, was attached to the French interest: the Venetians
favoured the Emperor; but they refused to declare them∣selves
at this juncture.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="383"/>
§ XLIX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1701.</NOTE> The French King consented to a renewal of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he negociations at the Hague; but, in the mean time,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ampered with the Dutch deputies, to engage them in a
separate treaty. Finding them determined to act in con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert
with the King of England, he protracted the confer∣ences,
in order to gain time, while he erected fortifications,
and drew lines on the frontiers of Holland, divided the
princes of the empire by his intrigues, and endeavoured
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o gain over the states of Italy. The Dutch, mean while,
exerted themselves in providing for their own security.
They re-enforced their garrisons, purchased supplies, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollicited succours from foreign potentates. The States
wrote a letter to King William, explaining the danger of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir situation, professing the most inviolable attachment
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the interest of England, and desiring that the stipulated
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber of troops should be sent immediately to their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssistance. The three Scottish regiments which he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etained in his own pay were immediately transported
from Scotland. The letter of the States-General he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommunicated to the House of Commons, who having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken it into consideration, resolved to assist his Majesty to
support his allies in maintaining the liberty of Europe;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to provide immediate succours for the States-Gene∣ral,
according to the treaty of 1677. The House of Peers,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whom the letter was also communicated, carried their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal still farther. They presented an address, in which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey desired his Majesty would not only perform the arti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les
of any former treaty with the States-General, but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso engage with them in a strict league offensive and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensive,
for their common preservation; and invite into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the princes and states that were concerned in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent visible danger arising from the union of France and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pain. They exhorted him to enter into such alliances
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Emperor, as his Majesty should think necessary,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuant to the ends of the treaty concluded in the year
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>689. They assured him of their hearty and sincere assist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce,
not doubting that Almighty God would protect his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cred person in so righteous a cause; and that the unani∣mity,
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>
wealth, and courage of his subjects would carry him
with honour and success through all the difficulties of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
just war. Lastly, they took leave humbly to represent
that the dangers to which his kingdom and allies had been
exposed, were chiefly owing to the fatal counsels that pre∣vented
his Majesty's sooner meeting his people in parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>§ L. These proceedings of both Houses could not but be
very agreeable to the King, who expressed his satisfaction
in his answer to each apart. They were the more remark∣able,
as at this very time considerable progress was made
in a design to impeach the old ministry. This deviation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
therefore, from the tenour of their former conduct could
be owing to no other motive than a sense of their own
danger, and resentment against France, which, even du∣ring
the negociation, had been secretly employed in making
preparations to surprise and distress the States-General.
The Commons having expressed their sentiments on this
subject, resumed the consideration of the partition-treaty.
They had appointed a committee to examine the journals
of the House of Lords, and to report their proceedings in
relation to the treaty of partition. When the report wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made by Sir Edward Seymour, the House resolved itself
into a committee, to consider the state of the nation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
after warm debates, they resolved, That William Earl o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Portland, by negociating and concluding the treaty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
partition, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour▪
They ordered Sir John Leveson Gower to impeach him a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the bar of the House of Lords: and named a committee to
prepare the articles of his impeachment. Then, in a con∣ference
with the Lords, they desired to know the parti∣culars
of what had passed between the Earl of Portland an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Secretary Vernon, in relation to the partition-treaty, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
also what other information they had obtained concern∣ing
negociations or treaties of partition of the Spanish
monarchy. The Lords demurring to this demand, the
Lower House resolved to address the King, That copie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of both treaties of partition, together with all the power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="379" REF="385"/>
and instructions for negociating those treaties, should be
laid before them. The copies were according produced,
and the Lords sent down to the Commons two papers,
containing the powers granted to the Earls of Portland
and Jersey, for signing both treaties of partition. The
House afterwards ordered, That Mr. Secretary Vernon
should lay before them all the letters which had passed be∣tween
the Earl of Portland and him, in relation to those
treaties; and he thought proper to obey their command.
Nothing could be more scandalously partial than the con∣duct
of the Commons on this occasion. They resolved
to skreen the Earl of Jersey, Sir Joseph Williamson, and
Mr. Vernon, who had been as deeply concerned as any
others in that transaction; and pointed all their vengeance
against the Earls of Portland and Orford, and the Lords
Somers and Hallifax. Some of the members even tam∣pered
with Kidd, who was now a prisoner in Newgate, to
accuse Lord Somers as having encouraged him in his pi∣racy.
He was brought to the bar of the House, and ex∣amined:
but he declared that he had never spoke to Lord
Somers; and that he had no order from those concerned
in the ship, but that of pursuing his voyage against the
pirates in Madagascar. Finding him unfit for their pur∣pose,
they left him to the course of law; and he was
hanged, with some of his accomplices.</P>
<P>§ LI. Lord Somers understanding that he was accused
in the House of Commons of having consented to the par∣tition
treaty, desired that he might be admitted and heard
in his own defence. His request being granted, he told
the House, that when he received the King's letter con∣cerning
the partition-treaty, with an order to send over
the necessary powers in the most secret manner, he thought
it would have been taking too much upon him to put a
stop to a treaty of such consequence, when the life of the
King of Spain was so precarious; for, had the King died
before the treaty was finished, and he been blamed for de∣laying
the necessary powers, he could not have justified
his own conduct, since the King's letter was really a war∣rant:
<PB N="380" REF="386"/>
that, nevertheless, he had written a letter to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty, objecting to several particulars in the treaty, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
proposing other articles which he thought were for the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terest
of his country: that he thought himself bound t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
put the great seal to the treaty when it was concluded
that, as a privy-counsellor, he had offered his best advice
and as chancellor, executed his office according to his duty
After he had withdrawn, his justification gave rise to a long
debate, which ended in a resolution carried by a majority
of seven voices, That John Lord Somers, by advising hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty to conclude the treaty of partition, whereby larg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
territories of the Spanish monarchy were to be delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
up to France, was guilty of a high crime and misdemean<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our.
Votes to the same effect were passed against Edward
Earl of Orford, and Charles Lord Hallifax; and all three
were impeached at the bar of the Upper House. But the
Commons knowing that those impeachments would pro∣duce
nothing in the House of Lords, where the opposit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
interest predominated, they resolved to proceed against th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
accused noblemen in a more expeditious and effectual way
of branding their reputation. They voted and presente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an address to the King, desiring he would remove then<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from his councils and presence for ever, as advisers of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
treaty so pernicious to the trade and welfare of England
They concluded, by repeating their assurances, that they
would always stand by and support his Majesty to the ut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most
of their power, against all his enemies both at hom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and abroad. Ths King, in his answer, artfully overlooke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the first part of the remonstrance. He thanked them fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their repeated assurances; and told them he would employ
none in his service but such as should be thought mos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
likely to improve that mutual trust and confidence betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him and his people, which was so necessary at that con∣juncture,
both for their own security and the preservation
of their allies.</P>
<P>§ LII. The Lords, incensed at this step of the Commons
which they considered as an insult upon their tribunal
and a violation of common justice, drew up and delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>
a counter-address, humbly beseeching his Majesty, that he
would not pass any censure upon the accused lords, until
they should be tried on the impeachments, and judgement
be given according to the usage of parliament. The King
was so perplexed by these opposite representations, that he
knew not well what course to follow. He made no reply
to the counter-address; but allowed the names of the im∣peached
lords to remain in the council-books. The
Commons having carried their point, which was to stig∣matize
those noblemen, and prevent their being employed
for the future, suffered the impeachments to be neglected
until they themselves moved for trial. On the fifth day of
May the House of Lords sent a message to the Commons,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mporting, That no articles had as yet been exhibited
against the noblemen whom they had impeached. The
charge was immediately drawn up against the Earl of Or∣ford:
him they accused of having received exorbitant
grants from the crown: of having been concerned with
Kidd the pirate: of having committed abuses in manag∣ing
and victualling the fleet, when it lay on the coast of
Spain; and lastly, of having advised the partition-treaty.
The Earl in his own defence declared, that he had re∣ceived
no grant from the King, except a very distant re∣version,
and a present of ten thousand pounds, after he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lefeated the French at La Hogue: that in Kidd's affair he
had acted legally, and with a good intention towards the
publick, though to his own loss: that his accounts with
regard to the fleet which he commanded had been exa∣mined
and passed; yet he was ready to wave the advan∣tage,
and justify himself in every particular: and he abso∣lutely
denied that he had given any advice concerning the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaty of partition. Lord Somers was accused of having
set the seals to the powers, and afterwards to the treaties:
of having accepted some grants: of having been an ac∣complice
with Kidd; and of having been guilty of partial
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd dilatory proceedings in chancery. He answered every
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticle of the charge; but no replication was made by the
Commons, either to him or to the Earl of Orford. When
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
the Commons were stimulated by another message from
the Peers, relating to the impeachments of the Earl o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Portland and Lord Hallifax, they declined exhibiting arti∣cles
against the former, on pretence of respect for his Ma∣jesty;
but on the fourteenth of June the charge against
Hallifax was sent up to the Lords. He was taxed with
possessing a grant in Ireland, without paying the produce
of it, according to the law lately enacted concerning those
grants: with enjoying another grant out of the forest of
Deane, to the waste of the timber, and the prejudice of
the navy; with having held places that were incompati∣ble,
by being at the same time commissioner of the Trea∣sury,
and chancellor of the Exchequer; and with having
advised the two treaties of partition. He answered, that
his grant in Ireland was of debts and sums of money, not
within the act concerning confiscated estates: that all he
had ever received from it did not exceed four hundred
pounds, which, if he was bound to repay, a common
action would lie against him; but every man was not to
be impeached who did not discharge his debts at the very
day of payment. He observed, that as his grant in the
forest of Deane extended to weedings only, it could occasion
no waste of timber, nor prejudice to the navy: that the
auditor's place was held by another person, until he ob∣tained
the King's leave to withdraw from the Treasury
that he never saw the first treaty of partition, nor was hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
advice asked upon the subject: that he had never heard o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the second but once before it was concluded; and then he
spoke his sentiments freely on the subject. This answer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
like the others, would have been neglected by the Com∣mons,
whose aim was now to evade the trials, had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Lords pressed them by messages to expedite the articles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
They even appointed a day for Orford's trial, and signifie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their resolutions to the Commons. These desired that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
committee of both Houses should be named for settling
preliminaries, one of which was, That the lord to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
tried should not sit as a peer; and the other imported<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
That those lords impeached for the same matter should
<PB N="383" REF="389"/>
not vote in the trial of each other. They likewise desired
that Lord Somers should be first tried. The Lords made
no objection to this last demand: but they rejected the pro∣posal
of a committee consisting of both Houses, alledging,
that the Commons were parties, and had no title to sit
in equality with the judges, or to settle matters relating
to the trial; that this was a demand contrary to the prin∣ciples
of law and rules of justice, and never practised in
any court or nation. The Lords, indeed, had yielded to
this expedient in the popish plot, because it was a case of
treason, in which the King's life and safety of the kingdom
were concerned, while the people were jealous of the
court, and the whole nation was in a ferment: but at
present the times were quiet, and the charge amounted
to nothing more than misdemeanours; therefore, the Lords
could not assent to such a proposal as was derogatory from
their jurisdiction. Neither would they agree to the preli∣minaries;
but, on the twelfth day of June, resolved,
That no peer impeached for high crimes and misdemea∣nours,
should, upon his trial, be without the bar; and,
That no peer impeached could be precluded from voting
on any occasion, except in his own trial. Divers messages
passed between the two houses; the Commons still insist∣ing
upon a committee to settle preliminaries: at length
the dispute was brought to a free conference.</P>
<P>§ LIII. Meanwhile, the King going to the House of
Peers, gave the royal assent to the bill of succession. In
his speech he expressed his warm acknowledgements for
their repeated assurances of supporting him in such allian∣ces
as should be most proper for the preservation of the
liberty of Europe, and for the security of England and
the States-General. He observed, that the season of the
year was advanced: that the posture of affairs absolutely
required his presence abroad: and he recommended dis∣patch
of the publick business, especially of those matters
which were of the greatest importance. The Commons
thanked him in an address for having approved of their
proceedings: they declared they would support him in
<PB N="384" REF="390"/>
such alliances as he should think fit to make in conjunction
with the Emperor and the States-General, for the peace o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Europe, and reducing the exorbitant power of France<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Then they resumed their dispute with the Upper House. In
the free conference, Lord Haversham happened to tax the
Commons with partiality, in impeaching some Lords and
screening others, who were equally guilty of the same misde∣meanours.
Sir Christopher Musgrave and the managers
for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commons immediately withdrew: this unguarded
sally being reported to the House, they immediately re∣solved,
That John Lord Haversham had uttered most
scandalous reproaches and false expressions, highly re∣flecting
upon the honour and justice of the House of
Commons, tending to a breach in the good correspond∣ence
between the two Houses, and to the interruption of
the publick justice of the nation: That the said Lord Ha∣versham
should be charged before the Lords for the said
words: That the Lords should be desired to proceed in
justice against him, and to inflict upon him such punish∣ment
as so high an offence against the Commons did de∣serve.
The Commons had now found a pretence to justify
their delay; and declared they would not renew the con∣ference
until they should have received satisfaction. Lord
Haversham offered to submit to a trial; but insisted o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their first proving the words which he was said to have
spoken. When this declaration was imparted to the Com∣mons,
they said, the Lords ought to have censured him
in a summary way, and still refused to renew the confer∣ence.
The Lords, on the other hand, came to a resolution▪
That there should not be a committee of both Houses con∣cerning
the trial of the impeached lords. Then they resolved▪
That Lord Somers should be tried in Westminster-hall o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Tuesday the seventeenth day of June, and signified this reso∣lution
to the Lower House; reminding them at the same tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the articles against the Earl of Portland. The Common<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
refused to appear, alledging, they were the only judges
and that the evidence was not yet prepared. They sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
up the reasons of their non-appearance to the House o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="385" REF="391"/>
Lords, where they were supported by the new ministry
and all the malcontents; and produced very warm de∣bates.
The majority carried their point piecemeal, by
dint of different votes, against which very severe protests
were entered. On the day appointed for the trial, they
sent a message to the Commons, that they were going to
Westminster-hall. The other impeached lords asked leave,
and were permitted to withdraw. The articles of im∣peachment
against Lord Somers, and his answers, being
read in Westminster-hall, and the Commons not appear∣ing
to prosecute, the Lords adjourned to their own house,
where they debated concerning the question that was to
be put. This being settled, they returned to West∣minster-hall;
and the question being put, “That John
Lord Somers be acquitted of the articles of impeach∣ment
against him, exhibited by the House of Commons,
and all things therein contained; and, That the im∣peachment
be dismissed,” it was carried by a majority
of thirty-five. The Commons, exasperated at these pro∣ceedings,
resolved, That the Lords had refused justice to
the Commons: That they had endeavoured to overturn
the right of impeachments lodged in the Commons by the
ancient constitution of the kingdom: That all the ill con∣sequences
which might attend the delay of the supplies
given for the preservation of the publick peace, and the
maintenance of the balance of Europe, would be owing to
those who, to procure an indemnity for their own crimes,
had used their utmost endeavours to make a breach between
the two Houses. The Lords sent a message to the Commons,
giving them to understand, that they had acquitted Lord
Somers, and dismissed the impeachment, as nobody had
appeared to support the articles; and that they had ap∣pointed
next Monday for the trial of the Earl of Orford.
They resolved, That unless the charge against Lord
Haversham should be prosecuted by the Commons before
the end of the session, the Lords would adjudge him inno∣cent:
That the resolutions of the Commons in their late
votes contained most unjust reslexions on the honour and
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
justice of the Peers: That they were contrived to cover
their affected and unreasonable delays in prosecuting the
impeached Lords: That they manifestly tended to the de∣struction
of the judicature of the Lords; to the rendering
trials on impeachments impracticable for the future; and
to the subverting the constitution of the English govern∣ment:
That, therefore, whatever ill consequences might
arise from theso long deferring the supplies for this year's
service were to be attributed to the fatal council of the
putting off the meeting of a parliament so long, and to
the unnecessary delays of the House of Commons. On
the twenty-third day of June, the articles of impeach∣ment
against Edward Earl of Orford were read in West∣minster-hall;
but the House of Commons having pre∣viously
ordered that none of their members should appear
at this pretended trial, those articles were not supported:
so that his lordship was acquitted, and the impeachment
dismissed. Next day, the impeachment against the Duke
of Leeds, which had lain seven years neglected, together
with those against the Earl of Portland and Lord Hallifax,
as well as the charge against Lord Haversham, were dis∣missed
for want of prosecution. Each House ordered a
narrative of these proceedings to be published; and their
mutual animosity had proceeded to such a degree of ran∣cour,
as seemed to preclude all possibility of reconcilia∣tion.
The Commons, in the whole course of this trans∣action,
had certainly acted from motives of faction
and revenge; for nothing could be more unjust, frivolous,
and partial, than the charge exhibited in the articles of
impeachment, their anticipating address to the King, and
their affected delay in the prosecutions. Their conduct on
this occasion was so flagrant as to attract the notice of the
common people, and inspire the generality of the nation
with disgust. This the Whigs did not fail to augment by
the arts of calumny, and, in particular, by insinuating
that the court of Versailles had found means to engage the
majority of the Commons in its interest.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="393"/>
§ LIV. This faction had, since the beginning of this
session, employed their emissaries in exciting a popular
aversion to the Tory ministers and members, and suc∣ceeded
so well in their endeavours, that they formed a
scheme of obtaining petitions from different counties and
corporations, that should induce the Commons to alter
their conduct, on the supposition that it was contrary to
the sense of the nation. In execution of this scheme a pe∣tition,
signed by the deputy-lieutenants, above twenty
justices of the peace, the grand jury and freeholders of the
county of Kent, had been presented to the House of
Commons on the eighteenth day of May, by five gentle∣men
of fortune and distinction. The purport of this re∣monstrance
was, to recommend union among themselves,
and confidence in his Majesty, whose great actions for
the nation could never be forgot without the blackest in∣gratitude<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:
to beg they would have regard to the voice of
the people; that their religion and safety might be effec∣tually
provided for; that their royal addresses might be
turned into bills of supply; and that his most sacred Ma∣jesty
might be enabled powerfully to assist his allies before
it should be too late. The House was so incensed at the
petulance of the petition, that they voted it scandalous,
insolent, and seditious; and ordered the gentlemen who
had presented it to be taken into custody. They were
afterwards committed to the Gate-house, where they re∣mained
till the prorogation of parliament: but they had
no reason to repine at their imprisonment, which recom∣mended
them to the notice and esteem of the publick.
They were visited and caressed by the chiefs of the Whig-interest,
and considered as martyrs to the liberties of the
people. Their confinement gave rise to a very extraordinary
paper, intitled, “A Memorial from the gentlemen, free∣holders,
and inhabitants, of the counties of—, in be∣half
of themselves, and many thousands of the good people
of England.” It was signed Legion, and sent to the
Speaker in a letter, commanding him, in the name of two
hundred thousand Englishmen, to deliver it to the House
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>
of Commons. In this strange expostulation, the House
was charged with illegal and unwarrantable practices, in
fifteen particulars: a new claim of right was ranged under
seven heads; and the Commons were admonished to act
according to their duty, as specified in this memorial, on
pain of incurring the refentment of an injured nation. It
was concluded in these words: “For Englishmen are no
more to be slaves to parliaments than to kings—our
name is Legion, and we are many.” The Commons
were equally provoked and intimidated by this libel, which
was the production of one Daniel de Foe, a scurrilous
party-writer, in very little estimation. They would not,
however, deign to take notice of it in the House: but a
complaint being made of endeavours to raise tumults and
seditions, a committee was appointed to draw up an ad∣dress
to his Majesty, informing him of those seditious en∣deavours,
and beseeching him to provide for the publick
peace and security.</P>
<P>§ LV. The House, however, perceiving plainly that
they had incurred the odium of the nation, which began
to clamour for a war with France, and dreading the po∣pular
resentment, thought fit to change their measures
with respect to this object, and present the address w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have already mentioned, in which they promised to sup∣port
him in the alliances he should contract with the
Emperor and other states, in order to bridle the exorbitant
power of France. They likewise proceeded in earnest
upon the supply, and voted funds for raising about two
millions seven hundred thousand pounds, to defray the
expense of the ensuing year. They voted thirty thousand
seamen, and resolved that ten thousand troops should be
transported from Ireland to Holland, as the auxiliaries
stipulated in the treaty of 1677 with the States-General.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds were constituted of a land-tax, cer∣tain
duties on merchandise, and a weekly deduction from
the Excise, so as to bring down the civil list to six hun∣dred
thousand pounds; as the Duke of Gloucester was
dead, and James's queen refused her allowance. They
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
passed a bill for taking away all privilege of parliament in
legal prosecutions, during the intermediate prorogations:
their last struggle with the Lords was concerning a bill
for appointing commissioners to examine and state the pub∣lick
accounts. The persons nominated for this purpose
were extremely obnoxious to the majority of the Peers, as
violent partisans of the Tory faction: when the bill,
therefore, was sent up to the Lords, they made some
amendments, which the Commons rejected. The former
animosity between the two Houses began to revive, when
the King interrupted their disputes, by putting an end to
the session, on the twenty-fourth day of June, after
having thanked the parliament for their zeal in the pub∣lick
service, and exhorted them to a discharge of their
duties in their several counties. He was, no doubt, ex∣tremely
pleased with such an issue of a session that had
begun with a very inauspicious aspect. His health daily
declined: but he concealed the decay of his constitution,
that his allies might not be discouraged from engaging in
a confederacy of which he was deemed the head and chief
support. He conferred the command of the ten thousand
troops destined for Holland upon the Earl of Marlbo∣rough,
and appointed him, at the same time, his plenipo∣tentiary
to the States-General: a choice that evinced his
discernment and discretion; for that nobleman surpassed
all his cotemporaries, both as a general and a politician.
He was cool, penetrating, intrepid, and persevering,
plausible, insinuating, artful, and dissembling.</P>
<P>§ LVI. A regency being established, the King embarked
for Holland in the beginning of July. On his arrival at
the Hague he assisted at an assembly of the States-General,
whom he harangued in very affectionate terms, and was
answered with great cordiality: then he made a progress
round the frontiers, to examine the state of the garrisons;
and gave such orders and directions as he judged necessary
for the defence of the country. Mean while, the French
minister D'Avaux being recalled from the Hague, deli∣vered
a letter to the States from the French King, who
<PB N="390" REF="396"/>
complained that they had often interrupted the conferences,
from which no good fruits were to be expected: but he
assured them it wholly depended upon themselves, whether
they should continue to receive marks of his ancient friend∣ship
for their republick. This letter was accompanied
by an insolent memorial, to which the States-General
returned a very spirited answer. As they expected nothing
now but hostilities from France, they redoubled their dili∣gence
in making preparations for their own defence. They
repaired their fortifications, augmented their army, and
hired auxiliaries. King William and they had already
engaged in an alliance with the King of Denmark, who
undertook to furnish a certain number of troops, in con∣sideration
of a subsidy; and they endeavoured to mediate
a peace between Sweden and Poland: but this they could
not effect. France had likewise offered her mediation be∣tween
those powers, in hopes of bringing over Sweden to
her interest; and the court of Vienna had tampered with
the King of Poland; but he persisted in his resolution to
prosecute the war. The Spaniards began to be very un∣easy
under the dominion of their new master. They were
shocked at the insolence of his French ministers and at∣tendants,
and much more at the manners and fashions which
they introduced. The grandees found themselves very
little considered by their sovereign; and resented his oeco∣nomy;
for he had endeavoured to retrench the expense of
the court, which had used to support their magnificence.
Prince Eugene, at the head of the Imperial army, had
entered Italy by Vicenza, and passed the Adige near Carpi,
where he defeated a body of five thousand French forces.
The enemy were commanded by the Duke of Savoy,
assisted by Mareschal Catinat and the Prince of Vaude∣mont,
who did not think proper to hazard an engage∣ment:
but Mareschal Villeroy arriving in the latter end of
August, with orders to attack the Imperialists, Catinat
retired in disgust. The new general marched immediately
towards Chiari, where Prince Eugene was entrenched,
and attacked his camp; but met with such a reception,
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
that he was obliged to retire with the loss of five thousand
men. Towards the end of the campaign the Prince took
possession of all the Mantuan territories, except Mantua
itself, and Goito, the blockade of which he formed. He
reduced all the places on the Oglio, and continued in the
field during the whole winter, exhibiting repeated marks
of the most invincible courage, indefatigable vigilance,
and extensive capacity in the art of war. In January he
had well nigh surprised Cremona, by introducing a body
of men through an old aqueduct. They forced one of the
gates, by which the Prince and his followers entered:
Villeroy being wakened by the noise, ran out into the
street, where he was taken; and the town must have been
infallibly reduced, had Prince Eugene been joined by
another body of troops, which he had ordered to march
from the Parmesan, and secure the bridge. These not ar∣riving
at the time appointed, an Irish regiment in the
French service took possession of the bridge, and the Prince
was obliged to retire with his prisoner.</P>
<P>§ LVII. The French King, alarmed at the activity
and military genius of the Imperial general, sent a re-en∣forcement
to his army in Italy, and the Duke of Ven∣dome
to command his forces in that country: he likewise
importuned the Duke of Savoy to assist him effectually:
but that Prince having obtained all he could expect from
France, became cold and backward. His second daugh∣ter
was by this time married to the new King of Spain,
who met her at Barcelona, where he found himself in∣volved
in disputes with the states of Catalonia, who refus∣ed
to pay a tax he had imposed, until their privileges
should be confirmed; and he was obliged to gratify them
in this particular.—The war continued to rage in the
North. The young King of Sweden routed the Saxons
upon the river Danu: thence he marched into Courland,
and took possession of Mittau without opposition; while
the King of Poland retired into Lithuania. In Hungary
the French emissaries endeavoured to sow the seeds of a
new revolt. They exerted themselves with indefatigable
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
industry in almost every court of Christendom. They
had already gained over the Elector of Bavaria, and his
brother, the Elector of Cologn, together with the Dukes
of Wolfenbuttle and Saxa-gotha, who professed neutrali∣ty,
while they levied troops, and made such preparations
for war, as plainly indicated that they had received subsi∣dies
from France. Louis had also extorted a treaty of al∣liance
from the King of Portugal, who was personally at∣tached
to the Austrian interest: but this weak prince
was a slave to his ministers, whom the French King had
corrupted. During this summer the French coasts were
over-awed by the combined fleets of England and Holland,
under the command of Sir George Rooke, who sailed
down the channel in the latter end of August, and de∣tached
Vice-Admiral Benbow with a strong squadron to
the West-Indies. In order to deceive the French King,
with regard to the destination of this fleet, King William
demanded the free use of the Spanish harbours, as if his
design had been to send a squadron to the Mediterranean:
but he met with a repulse, while the French ships were
freely admitted. About this period the King revoked his
letters-patent to the commissioners of the Admiralty, and
constituted the Earl of Pembroke lord-high Admiral of
England, in order to avoid the factions, the disputes, and
divided counsels of a board. The Earl was no sooner
promoted to this office, than he sent Captain Loades with
three srigates to Cadiz, to bring home the sea-stores and
effects belonging to the English in that place, before the
war should commence; and this piece of service was suc∣cessfully
performed. The French King, in order to en∣joy
all the advantages that could be derived from his union
with Spain, established a company, to open a trade with
Mexico and P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru; and concluded a new assiento treaty
for supplying the Spanish plantations with Negroes. At
the same time, he sent a strong squadron to the port of
Cadiz. The French dress was introduced into the court
of Spain; and, by a formal edict, the grandees of that
kingdom and the peers of France were put on a level in
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
each nation. There was no vigour left in the councils of
Spain: her finances were exhausted; and her former spi∣rit
seemed to be quite extinguished: the nobility were
beggars, and the common people overwhelmed with indi∣gence
and distress. The condition of France was not
much more prosperous. She had been harrassed by a long
war, and now saw herself on the eve of another, which
in all probability would render her completely miserable.</P>
<P>§ LVIII. These circumstances were well known to
the Emperor and the maritime powers, and served to ani∣mate
their negociations for another grand alliance. Con∣ferences
were opened at the Hague; and, on the seventh
day of September, a treaty was concluded between his
Imperial Majesty, England, and the States-General. The
objects proposed, were to procure satisfaction to the Em∣peror
in the Spanish succession, and sufficient security for
the dominions and commerce of the allies. They engaged
to use their endeavours for recovering the Spanish Nether∣lands,
as a barrier between Holland and France; and for
putting the Emperor in possession of the duchy of Milan,
Naples, and Sicily, with the lands and islands upon the
coast of Tuscany belonging to the Spanish dominions.
They agreed, that the King of England, and the States-General,
should keep and possess whatever lands and ci∣ties
they could conquer from the Spaniards in the Indies:
That the confederates should faithfully communicate their
designs to one another: That no party should treat of
peace, or truce, but jointly with the rest: That they
should concur in preventing the union of France and
Spain under the same government; and hinder the French
from possessing the Spanish Indies: That, in concluding
a peace, the confederates should provide for the main∣tenance
of the commerce carried on by the maritime
powers to the dominions taken from the Spaniards, and
secure the states by a barrier: That they should, at the
same time, settle the exercise of religion in the new con∣quests:
That they should assist one another with all their
forces, in case of being invaded by the French King, or
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
any other potentate, on account of this alliance: That a
defensive alliance should remain between them, even af∣ter
the peace: That all kings, princes, and states should
be at liberty to engage in this alliance. They determin∣ed
to employ two months, to obtain, by amicable means,
the satisfaction and security which they demanded; and
stipulated, that within six weeks the treaty should be ra∣tified.</P>
<P>§ LIX. On the sixteenth day of September, King James
expired at St. Germain's, after having laboured under a
tedious indisposition. This unfortunate monarch, since
the miscarriage of his last attempt for recovering his throne,
had laid aside all thought of worldly grandeur, and de∣voted
his whole attention to the concerns of his soul.
Though he could not prevent the busy genius of his
Queen from planning new schemes of restoration, he was
always best pleased when wholly detached from such chi∣merical
projects. Hunting was his chief diversion; but
religion was his constant care. Nothing could be more
harmless than the life he led; and, in the course of it, he
subjected himself to uncommon penance and mortificati∣on.
He frequently visited the poor monks of La Trappe,
who were much edified by his humble and pious deport∣ment.
His pride and arbitrary temper seem to have vanish∣ed
with his greatness He became affable, kind and easy
to all his dependents; and his religion certainly opened
and improved the virtues of his heart, though it seemed
to impair the faculties of his soul. In his last illness he
conjured his son to prefer his religion to every worldly
advantage, and even to renounce all thoughts of a crown,
if he could not enjoy it without offering violence to his
faith. He recommended to him the practice of justice
and Christian forgiveness; he himself declaring, that
he heartily forgave the Prince of Orange, the Emperor,
and all his enemies. He died with great marks of devo∣tion,
and was interred, at his own request, in the
church of the English Benedictines in Paris, without any
funeral solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="401"/>
§ LX. Before his death he was visited by the French
King, who seemed touched with his condition, and de∣clared,
that, in case of his death, he would own his son as
King of England. This promise James's Queen had al∣ready
extorted from him, by the interest of Madame de
Maintenon and the Dauphin. Accordingly, when James
died, the pretended Prince of Wales was proclaimed King
of England at St. Germain's, and treated as such at the
court of Versailles. His title was likewise recognized by
the King of Spain, the Duke of Savoy, and the Pope.
William was no sooner informed of this transaction, than
he dispatched a courier to the King of Sweden, as guaran∣tee
of the treaty of Ryswick, to complain of this manifest
violation. At the same time, he recalled the Earl of Man∣chester
from Paris, and ordered him to return without
taking an audience of leave. That nobleman immediately
withdrew, after having intimated to the Marquis de Torcy
the order he had received. Louis, in vindication of his
own conduct, dispersed through all the courts of Europe
a manifesto, in which he affirmed, that in owning the
Prince of Wales as King of England he had not infringed
any article of the treaty of Ryswick. He confessed, that
in the fourth article, he had promised that he would not
disturb the King of Great-Britain in the peaceable pos∣session
of his dominions; and he declared his intention
was to observe that promise punctually. He observed,
that his generosity would not allow him to abandon the
Prince of Wales or his family: that he could not refuse
him a title which was due to him by birth; that he had
more reason to complain of the King of Great-Britain,
and the States-General, whose declarations and prepara∣tions
in favour of the Emperor might be regarded as real
contraventions to treaties: finally, he quoted some in∣stances
from history, in which the children enjoyed the
titles of kingdoms which their fathers had lost. These
reasons, however, would hardly have induced the French
King to take such a step, had not he perceived that a war
with England was inevitable; and that he should be able
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>
to reap some advantages in the course of it, from espous∣ing
the cause of the Pretender.</P>
<P>§ LXI. The substance of the French manifesto was
published in London, by Poussin, the secretary of Tal∣lard,
who had been left in England, as agent for the
court of Versailles. He was now ordered to leave the
kingdom, which was filled with indignation at Louis,
for having pretended to declare who ought to be their so∣vereign.
The city of London presented an address to the
lords-justices, expressing the deepest resentment of the
French King's presumption; assuring his Majesty, that
they would, at all times, exert the utmost of their abili∣ties
for the preservation of his person, and the defence of
his just rights, in opposition to all invaders of his crown
and dignity. Addresses of the same nature were sent up
from all parts of the kingdom, and could not but be
agreeable to William. He had now concerted measures
for acting with vigour against France; and he resolved to
revisit his kingdom, after having made a considerable pro∣gress
in a treaty of perpetual alliance between England and
the States-General, which was afterwards brought to per∣fection
by his plenipotentiary, the Earl of Marlborough.
The King's return, however, was delayed a whole month
by a severe indisposition, during which the Spanish minister
De Quiros hired certain physicians, to consult together
upon the state and nature of his distemper. They de∣clared,
that he could not outlive many weeks; and this
opinion was transmitted to Madrid. William, however,
baffled the prognostick, though his constitution had su∣stained
such a rude shock, that he himself perceived his
end was near. He told the Earl of Portland, he found
himself so weak, that he could not expect to live another
summer: but charged him to conceal this circumstance
until he should be dead. Notwithstanding this near ap∣proach
to dissolution, he exerted himself with surprising
diligence and spirit in establishing the confederacy, and
settling the plan of operations. A subsidiary treaty was
concluded with the King of Prussia, who engaged to
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
furnish a certain number of troops. The Emperor agreed
to maintain ninety thousand men in the field against
France, the proportion of the states was limited to one
hundred and two thousand; and that of England did not
exceed forty thousand, to act in conjunction with the
allies.</P>
<P>§ LXII. On the fourth day of November the King ar∣rived
in England, which he found in a strange ferment,
produced from the mutual animosity of the two factions.
They reviled each other in words and writing with all
the falsehood of calumny, and all the bitterness of rancour;
so that truth, candour, and temperance seemed to be ba∣nished
by consent of both parties. The king had found
himself deceived in his new ministers, who had opposed
his measures with all their influence. He was particularly
disgusted with the deportment of the Earl of Rochester,
who proved altogether imperious and untractable; and,
instead of moderating, inflamed the violence of his party.
The King declared the year in which that nobleman di∣rected
his councils was the uneasiest of his whole life.
He could not help expressing his displeasure in such a
coldness of reserve, that Rochester told him he would
serve his Majesty no longer, since he did not enjoy his
confidence. William made no answer to this expostu∣lation,
but resolved he would see him no more. The
Earl however, at the desire of Mr. Harley, became more
pliant and submissive; and, after the King's departure
for Holland, repaired to his government of Ireland, in
which he now remained, exerting all his endeavours to
acquire popularity. William foreseeing nothing but
opposition from the present spirit of the House of Com∣mons,
closetted some of their leaders, with a view to be∣speak
their compliance: but finding them determined to
pursue their former principles, and to insist upon their
impeachments, he resolved, with the advice of his friends,
to dissolve the parliament. This step he was the more
easily induced to take, as the Commons were become ex∣tremely
odious to the nation in general, which breathed
<PB N="398" REF="404"/>
nothing but war and defiance against the French monarch.
The parliament was accordingly dissolved by proclamation,
and another summoned to meet on the thirtieth day of
December.</P>
<P>§ LXIII. Never did the two parties proceed with such
heat and violence against each other, as in their endeavours
to influence the new elections. The Whigs, however,
obtained the victory, as they included the monied-interest,
which will always prevail among the borough-electors.
Corruption was now reduced into an open and avowed
commerce; and had not the people been so universally
venal and profligate, that no sense of shame remained, the
victors must have blushed for their success. Though the
majority thus obtained was staunch to the measures of
the court, the choice of Speaker fell upon Mr. Harley,
contrary to the inclination of the King, who favoured
Sir Thomas Lyttelton: but his Majesty's speech was re∣ceived
with universal applause. It was so much admired
by the well-wishers to the Revolution, that they printed
it with decorations, in the English, Dutch, and French
languages. It appeared as a piece of furniture in all their hou∣ses,
and as the king's last legacy to his own and all protest∣ant
people. In this celebrated harangue, he expatiated up∣on
the indignity offered to the nation by the French King's
acknowledging the pretended Prince of Wales: he ex∣plained
the dangers to which it was exposed, by his placing
his grandson on the throne of Spain: he gave them to
understand he had concluded several alliances, according
to the encouragement given him by both Houses of parlia∣ment,
which alliances should be laid before them, together
with other treaties still depending. He observed, that the
eyes of all Europe were upon this parliament; and all
matters at a stand, until their resolution should be known:
therefore, no time ought to be lost. He told them they
had yet an opportunity to secure for themselves and their
posterity the quiet enjoyment of their religion and liber∣ties,
if they were not wanting to themselves, but would
exert the ancient vigour of the English nation: but he de∣clared
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>
his opinion was, that should they neglect this occasion,
they had no reason to hope for another. He said it would
be necessary to maintain a great strength at sea, and a force
on land proportionable to that of their allies. He pressed
the Commons to support the publick credit, which could
not be preserved without keeping sacred that maxim,
That they shall never be losers who trust to a parliamen∣tary
security. He declared, that he never asked aids from
his people without regret: that what he desired was for
their own safety and honour, at such a critical time; and
that the whole should be appropriated to the purposes for
which it was intended. He expressed his willingness that
the accounts should be yearly submitted to the inspection
of parliament. He again recommended dispatch, together
with good bills for employing the poor, encouraging trade,
and suppressing vice. He expressed his hope that they
were come together, determined to avoid disputes and
differences, and to act with a hearty concurrence for pro∣moting
the common cause. He said he should think it as
great a blessing as could befal England, if they were as
much inclined to lay aside those unhappy fatal animosities
which divided and weakened them, as he was disposed to
make all his subjects safe and easy, as to any, even the
highest offences committed against his person. He con∣jured
them to disappoint the hopes of their enemies by
their unanimity. As he had always shewn, and always would
show, how desirous he was to be the common father of all
his people, he desired they would lay aside parties and di∣visions,
so as that no distinction should be heard of amongst
them, but of those who were friends to the protestant re∣ligion
and present establishment, and of those who wished for
a popish prince and a French government. He concluded by
affirming, that if they, in good earnest, desired to see
England hold the balance of Europe, and be indeed at the
head of the protestant interest, it would appear by their
improving the present opportunity. The Lords imme∣diately
drew up a warm and affectionate address, in which
they expressed their resentment of the proceedings of the
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
French King, in owning the pretended Prince of Wales for
King of England. They assured his Majesty they would
assist him to the utmost of their power against all his ene∣mies;
and when it should please God to deprive them of
his Majesty's protection, they would vigorously assist and
defend against the pretended Prince of Wales, and all
other pretenders whatsoever, every person and persons
who had right to succeed to the crown of England, by
virtue of the acts of parliament for establishing and limit∣ing
the succession. On the fifth of January, an address
to the same effect was presented by the Commons, and
both met with a very gracious reception from his Majesty.
The Lords, as a further proof of their zeal, having taken
into consideration the dangers that threatened Europe,
from the accession of the Duke of Anjou to the crown of
Spain, drew up another address, explaining their sense
of that danger; stigmatising the French King as a viola∣tor
of treaties; declaring their opinion, that his Majesty,
his subjects, and allies, could never be safe and secure,
until the House of Austria should be restored to their
rights, and the invader of the Spanish monarchy brought
to reason; and assuring his Majesty that no time should
be lost, nor any thing wanting on their parts, which might
answer the reasonable expectations of their friends abroad;
not doubting but to support the reputation of the English
name, when engaged under so great a prince, in the glo∣rious
cause of maintaining the liberty of Europe.</P>
<P>§ LXIV. The King, in order to acquire the confidence
of the Commons, ordered Mr. Secretary Vernon to lay
before them copies of the treaties and conventions he had
lately concluded, which were so well approved, that the
House unanimously voted the supply. By another vote,
they authorised the Exchequer to borrow six hundred
thousand pounds at six percent. for the service of the sleet
and fifty thousand pounds for the subsistence of guards and
garrisons. They deliberated upon the state of the navy,
with the debt due upon it, and examined an estimate of
what would by necessary for extraordinary repairs. They
<PB N="401" REF="407"/>
called for an account of that part of the national debt for
which no provision had been made. They ordered the
Speaker to write to the trustees for the forfeited estates in
Ireland, to attend the House with a full detail of their pro∣ceedings
in the execution of that act of parliament. On
the ninth day of January, they unanimously resolved, That
leave be given to bring in a bill for securing his Majesty's
person, and the succession of the crown in the protestant
line, for extinguishing the hopes of the pretended Prince
of Wales, and all other pretenders, and their open and
secret abettors. They resolved to address his Majesty,
that he would insert an article in all his treaties of alliance,
importing, That no peace should be made with France,
until his Majesty and the nation have reparation for the
great indignity offered by the French King, in owning,
and declaring the pretended Prince of Wales King of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. They agreed to main∣tain
forty thousand men for the sea service, and a like num∣ber
by land, to act in conjunction with the forces of the
allies, according to the proportions settled by the contract∣ing
powers. The supplies were raised by an imposition of
four shillings in the pound upon lands, annuities, pensions,
and stipends, and on the profits arising from the different
professions: by a tax of two and one-half per cent. on all
stock in trade, and money at interest; of five shillings in
the pound on all salaries, fees, and perquisites; a capitation
tax of four shillings: an imposition of one per cent. on
all shares in the capital stock of any corporation or com∣pany
which should be bought, sold, or bargained for; a
duty of sixpence per bushel on malt, and a further duty
on mum, cider, and perry.</P>
<P>§ LXV. The Commons seemed to vie with the Lords
in their zeal for the government. They brought in a bill
for attainting the pretended Prince of Wales, which being
sent up to the other House, passed with an additional
clause of attainder against the Queen, who acted as re∣gent
for the Pretender. This, however, was not carried
without great opposition in the House of Lords. When
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>
the bill was sent back to the Commons, they excepted to
the amendment as irregular. They observed, that at∣tainders
by bill constituted the most rigorous part of the
law; and that the stretching of it ought to be avoided.
They proposed, that the Queen should be attainted by a
separate bill. The Lords assented to the proposal: and the
bill against the pretended Prince of Wales passed. The
Lords passed another for attainting the Queen; however,
it was neglected in the House of Commons. But, the
longest and warmst debates of this session were produced
by a bill, which the Lords brought in, for abjuring the
pretended Prince of Wales, and swearing to the King, by
title of rightful and lawful king, and his heirs, according
to the act of settlement. It was proposed, that this oath
should be voluntary, tendered to all persons, and their
subscription or refusal recorded without any other penalty.
This article was violently opposed by the Earl of Not∣tingham,
and other lords of the Tory-interest. They
observed, that the government was first settled with another
oath, which was like an original contract: so that there
was no occasion for a new imposition: that oaths relating
to men's opinions had been always considered as severe
impositions; and that a voluntary oath was in its own na∣ture
unlawful. During these disputes, another bill of
abjuration was brought into the House of Commons by Sir
Charles Hedges, that should be obligatory on all persons
who enjoyed employments in church or state; it likewise
included an obligation to maintain the government in
King, Lords, and Commons, and to maintain the church
of England, together with the toleration for dissenters.
Warm debates arose upon the question, Whether the oath
should be imposed or voluntary? and at length it was
caried for imposition, by the majority of one voice. They
agreed to insert an additional clause, declaring it equally
penal to compass or imagine the death of her Royal High∣ness
the Princess Anne of Denmark, as it was to compass or
imagine the death of the King's eldest son and heir. In
the House of Peers this bill was strenuously opposed by the
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>
Tories; and, when after long debates it passed on the
twenty-fourth day of February, ten Lords entered a pro∣test
against it, as an unnecessary and severe imposition.</P>
<P>§ LXVI. The whole nation now seemed to join in
the cry for a war with France. Party heats began to
abate: the factions in the city of London were in great
measure moderated by the union of the two companies
trading to the East-Indies, which found their mutual in∣terest
required a coalition. The Tories in the House of
Commons having concurred so heartily with the inclina∣tions
of the people, resolved, as far as it lay in their power,
to justify the conduct of their party in the preceding par∣liament.
They complained of some petitions and addres∣ses
which had reflected upon the proceedings of the last
House of Commons, and particularly of the Kentish pe∣tition.
The majority, however, determined, that it was
the undoubted right of the people of England, to petition
or address the King, for the calling, sitting, or dissolving
of parliaments, and for the redressing of grievances; and
that every subject under any accusation, either by impeach∣ment
or otherwise, had a right to be brought to a speedy
trial. A complaint being likewise made, that the Lords
had denied the Commons justice in the matter of the late
impeachments, a furious debate ensued; and it was carried
by a very small majority that justice had not been denied.
In some points, however, they succeeded. In the case of
a controverted election at Maidstone, between Thomas
Blisse and Thomas Culpepper, the House resolved, That
the latter had been not only guilty of corrupt, scandalous,
and in direct practices, in endeavouring to procure himself
to be elected a burgess, but likewise, being one of the in∣struments
in promoting and presenting the scandalous,
insolent, and seditious petition, commonly called the
Kentish petition, to the last House of Commons, was
guilty of promoting a scandalous, villainous, and ground∣less
reflexion upon that House, by aspersing the members
with receiving French money, or being in the interest of
France; for which offence he was ordered to be commit∣ted
<PB N="404" REF="410"/>
to Newgate, and to be prosecuted by his Majesty's
attorney-general. They also resolved, That to assert that
the House of Commons is not the only representative of
the Commons of England tends to the subversion of the
rights and privileges of the House of Commons, and the
fundamental constitution of the government of this king∣dom:
That to assert, that the House of Commons have
no power of commitment, but of their own members,
tends to the subversion of the constitution of the House of
Commons: That to print or publish any books, or libels,
reflecting upon the proceedings of the House of Com∣mons,
or any member thereof, for or relating to his ser∣vice
therein, is a high violation of the rights and privi∣leges
of the House of Commons. Notwithstanding these
transactions, they did not neglect the vigorous prosecution
of the war. They addressed his Majesty to interpose with
his allies, that they might increase their quotas of land-forces,
to be put on board the fleet in proportion to the
numbers his Majesty should embark. When they had
settled the sums appropriated to the several uses of the war,
they presented a second address, desiring he would provide
for the half-pay officers in the first place, in the recruits
and levies to be made. The King assured them it was
always his intention to provide for those officers. He went
to the House of Peers and gave the royal assent to an act,
appointing commissioners to take, examine, and deter∣mine
the debts due to the army, navy, and the transport
service; and also to take an account of prizes taken during
the war.</P>
<P>§ LXVII. The affairs of Ireland were not a little em∣barrassed
by the conduct of the trustees appointed to take
cognizance of the forfeited estates. Their office was ex∣tremely
odious to the people, as well as to the court, and
their deportment was arbitrary and imperious. Several
individuals of that kingdom, provoked by the insolence
of the trustees on one hand, and encouraged by the coun∣tenance
of the courtiers on the other, endeavoured, by a
circular letter, to spirit up the grand-jury of Ireland against
<PB N="405" REF="411"/>
the act of resumption: petitions were presented to the King,
couched in very strong terms, affirming, that it was in∣jurious
to the protestant interest, and had been obtained by
gross misinformations. The King having communicated
these addresses to the House, they were immediately voted
scandalous, false, and groundless: and the Commons re∣solved,
That, notwithstanding the complaints and cla∣mours
against the trustees, it did not appear to the House
but those complaints were groundless: nevertheless, they
afterwards received several petitions, imploring relief against
the said act; and they ordered that the petitioners should be
relieved accordingly. Proposals were delivered in for in∣corporating
such as should purchase the said forfeitures, on
certain terms therein specified, according to the rent-roll,
when verified and made good to the purchasers: but,
whereas in this rent-roll the value of the estates had been
estimated at something more than seven hundred and six∣teen
thousand pounds, those who undertook to make the
purchase affirmed they were not worth five hundred
thousand pounds; and thus the affair remained in sus∣pense.</P>
<P>§ LXVIII. With respect to Scotland, the clamours of
that kingdom had not yet subsided. When the bill of
abjuration passed in the House of Peers, the Earl of Not∣tingham
had declared, that although he differed in opinion
from the majority in many particulars relating to that bill,
yet he was a friend to the design of it; and, in order to
secure a protestant succession, he thought an union of the
whole island was absolutely necessary. He, therefore,
moved for an address to the King, that he would dissolve
the parliament of Scotland now sitting, as the legality of
it might be called in question, on account of its having
been originally a convention; and that a new parliament
should be summoned, that they might treat about an union
of the two kingdoms. The King had this affair so much
at heart, that even when he was disabled from going to
the parliament in person, he sent a letter to the Commons,
expressing an eager desire that a treaty for this purpose
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>
might be set on foot, and earnestly recommending this
affair to the consideration of the House: but, as a new
parliament in Scotland could not be called without a
great risque, while the nation was in such a ferment, the
project was postponed to a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>§ LXIX. Before the King's return from Holland, he
had concerted with his allies the operations of the ensuing
campaign. He had engaged in a negociation with the
Prince of Hesse-D'Armstadt, who assured him, that if he
would besiege and take Cadiz, the Admiral of Castile, and
divers other grandees of Spain, would declare for the
house of Austria. The allies had also determined upon the
siege of Keyferswaert, which the Elector of Cologn had
delivered into the hands of the French: the Elector of
Hanover had resolved to disarm the Princes of Wolfen∣buttle:
the King of the Romans, and Prince Louis of
Baden, undertook to invest Landau: and the Emperor
promised to send a powerful re-enforcement to Prince
Eugene in Italy: but William did not live to see these
schemes put in execution. His constitution was by this
time almost exhausted, though he endeavoured to conceal
the effects of his malady, and to repair his health by exer∣cise.
On the twenty-first day of February, in riding to
Hampton-court from Kensington, his Horse fell under
him, and he himself was thrown upon the ground with
such violence, as produced a fracture in his collar-bone.
His attendants conveyed him to the palace of Hampton∣court,
where the fracture was reduced by Ronjat, his
serjeant-surgeon. In the evening he returned to Kensing∣ton
in his coach, and the two ends of the fractured bone
having been disunited by the jolting of the carriage, were
replaced under the inspection of Bidloo, his physician. He
seemed to be in a fair way of recovering till the first day of
March, when his knee appeared to be inflamed, with great
pain and weakness. Next day he granted a commission
under the great seal to several peers, for passing the bills
to which both Houses of Parliament had agreed, namely,
the act of attainder against the pretended Prince of Wales;
<PB N="407" REF="413"/>
and another in favour of the Quakers, enacting, That
their solemn affirmation and declaration should be accepted
instead of an oath in the usual form.</P>
<P>§ LXX. On the fourth day of March the King was so
well recovered of his lameness, that he took several turns
in the gallery at Kensington; but, sitting down on a
couch where he fell asleep, he was seised with a shivering,
which terminated in a fever and diarrhoea. He was at∣tended
by Sir Thomas Millington, Sir Richard Black∣more,
Sir Theodore Colledon, Dr. Bidloo, and other
eminent physicians; but their prescriptions proved inef∣fectual.
On the sixth he granted another commission for
passing the bill for the malt-tax, and the act of abjuration;
and, being so weak that he could not write his name, he,
in presence of the Lord-keeper and the clerks of parliament,
applied a stamp prepared for the purpose. The Earl of
Albemarle arriving from Holland, conferred with him in
private on the posture of affairs abroad: but he received
his informations with great coldness, and said, “<HI>Je tire
vers ma fin.</HI>—I approach the end of my life.” In the
evening he thanked Dr. Bidloo for his care and tenderness,
saying, “I know that you and the other learned physi∣cians
have done all that your art can do for my relief;
but, finding all means ineffectual, I submit.” He
received spiritual consolation from Archbishop <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enison,
and Burnet Bishop of Salisbury: on Sunday morning the
sacrament was administered to him. The lords of the
privy-council, and divers noblemen attended in the ad∣joining
apartments, and to some of them who were ad∣mitted
he spoke a little. He thanked Lord Auverquerque
for his long and faithful services: he delivered to Lord
Albemarle the keys of his closet and scrutore, telling him
he knew what to do with them. He enquired for the
Earl of Portland; but being speechless before that no∣bleman
arrived, he grasped his hand, and laid it to his
heart, with marks of the most tender affection. On the
eighth day of March he expired, in the fifty-second year
of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. The
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>
Lords Lexington and Scarborough, who were in waiting,
no sooner perceived the King was dead, than they or∣dered
Ronjat to untie from his left arm a black ribbon,
to which was affixed a ring, containing some hair of the
late Queen Mary. The body being opened and embalmed,
lay in state for some time at Kensington; and on the
twelfth day of April was deposited in a vault of Henry's
chapel in Westminster-abbey. In the beginning of May,
a will which he had entrusted with Monsieur Schuylem∣berg
was opened at the Hague. In this he had declared
his cousin Prince Frison of Nassau, Stadtholder of Fries∣land,
his sole and universal heir, and appointed the States-General
his executors. By a codicil annexed, he had be∣queathed
the lordship of Breevert, and a legacy of two
hundred thousand guilders, to the Earl of Albemarle.</P>
<P>§ LXXI. William III. was in his person of the middle
statute, a thin body, and delicate constitution, subject to
an asthma and continual cough from his infancy. He had
an aquiline nose, sparkling eyes, a large forehead, and a
grave solemn aspect. He was very sparing of speech: his
conversation was dry, and his manner disgusting, except
in battle, when his deportment was free, spirited, and
animating. In courage, fortitude, and equanimity, he
rivalled the most eminent warriors of antiquity; and his
natural sagacity made amends for the defects in his educa∣tion,
which had not been properly superintended. He
was religious, temperate, generally just and sincere, a
stranger to violent transports of passion, and might have
passed for one of the best princes of the age in which he
lived, had he never ascended the throne of Great-Britain.
But the distinguishing criterion of his character was am∣bition.
To this he sacrificed the punctilios of honour
and decorum, in deposing his own father-in-law and uncle;
and this he gratified at the expense of the nation that
raised him to sovereign authority. He aspired to the ho∣nour
of acting as umpire in all the contests of Europe;
and the second object of his attention was, the prosperity
of that country to which he owed his birth and extraction.
<PB N="409" REF="415"/>
Whether he really thought the interests of the continent
and Great-Britain were inseparable, or sought only to
drag England into the confederacy as a convenient ally,
certain it is, he involved these kingdoms in foreign con∣nexions,
which, in all probability, will be productive of
their ruin. In order to establish this favourite point, he
scrupled not to employ all the engines of corruption, by
which the morals of the nation were totally debauched.
He procured a parliamentary sanction for a standing ar∣my,
which now seems to be interwoven in the constituti∣on.
He introduced the pernicious practice of borrowing
upon remote funds; an expedient that necessarily hatch∣ed
a brood of usurers, brokers, contractors, and stock
jobbers, to prey upon the vitals of their country. He en∣tailed
upon the nation a growing debt, and a system of
politicks big with misery, despair, and destruction. To
sum up his character in a few words—William was a fa∣talist
in religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixton. Boyer. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> indefatigable in war, enterprising in po∣liticks,
dead to all the warm and generous emotions of
the human heart, a cold relation, an indifferent husband,
a disagreeable man, an ungracious prince, and an imperi∣pus
sovereign.</P>

§ 1. WILLIAM was succeeded as sovereign of
England by Anne Princess of Denmark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1701.</NOTE>
who ascended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her
age, to the general satisfaction of all parties. Even the
Jacobites seemed pleased with her elevation, on the sup∣position,
that as in all probability she would leave no heirs
of her own body, the dictates of natural affection would
induce her to alter the succession in favour of her own
brother. She had been taught to cherish warm senti∣ments
of the Tories, whom she considered as the friends
of monarchy, and the true sons of the church; and they
had always professed an inviolable attachment to her per∣son
and interest: but her conduct was wholly influenced
by the Countess of Marlborough, a woman of an imperi∣ous
temper and intriguing genius, who had been intimate
with the Princess from her tender years, and gained a
surprising ascendency over her. Anne had undergone
some strange vicissitudes of fortune in consequence of her
father's expulsion, and sustained a variety of mortificati∣ons
in the late reign, during which she conducted herself
with such discretion, as left little or no pretence for
censure or resentment. Such conduct, indeed, was in a
<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
great measure owing to a natural temperance of dispositi∣on,
not easily ruffled or inflamed. She was zealously de∣voted
to the church of England, from which her father
had used some endeavours to detach her before the Revo∣lution;
and she lived in great harmony with her husband,
to whom she bore six children, all of whom she had al∣ready
survived. William had no sooner yielded up his
breath, than the privy-council in a body waited on the new
Queen, who, in a short but sensible speech, assured them,
that no pains nor diligence should be wanting on her part,
to preserve and support the religion, laws, and liberties
of her country, to maintain the succession in the protestant
line, and the government in church and state, as by law
established. She declared her resolution to carry on the
preparations for opposing the exorbitant powers of France,
and to assure the allies, that she would pursue the true in∣terest
of England, together with their's, for the support
of the common cause. The members of the privy-council
having taken the oaths, she ordered a proclamation to be
published, signifying her pleasure, that all persons in of∣fice
of authority or government, at the decease of the
late King, should so continue till further directions. By
virtue of an act passed in the late reign, the parliament
continued sitting even after the King's death. Both
Houses met immediately, and unanimously voted an ad∣dress
of condolance and congratulation; and, in the after∣noon,
the Queen was proclaimed. Next day the Lords
and Commons severally attended her with an address, con∣gratulating
her Majesty's accession to the throne; and,
assuring her of their firm resolution to support her against
all her enemies whatsoever. The Lords acknowledged,
that their great loss was no otherwise to be repaired but
by a vigorous adherence to her Majesty and her allies, in
the prosecution of those measures already concerted to re¦duce
the exorbitant power of France. The Commons
declared, they would maintain the succession of the crown
in the protestant line, and effectually provide for the pub∣lick
credit of the nation. These addresses were graciously
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
received by the Queen, who, on the eleventh day of
March, went to the House of Peers with the usual so∣lemnity,
where, in a speech to both Houses, she expressed
her satisfaction at their unanimous concurrence with her
opinion, that too much could not be done for the encou∣ragement
of their allies in humbling the power of France;
and, desired they would consider of proper methods to∣wards
obtaining an union between England and Scotland.
She observed to the Commons, that the revenue for de∣fraying
the expenses of the civil government was expired;
and that she relied entirely on their affection for its being
supplied in such a manner as should be most suitable to
the honour and dignity of the crown. She declared it
should be her constant endeavour to make them the best
return for their duty and affection, by a careful and dili∣gent
administration for the good of all her subjects. “And
as I know my own heart to be entirely English (con∣tinued
she) I can very sincerely assure you, there is
not any thing you can expect or desire from me, which
I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prospe∣rity
of England; and you shall always find me a strict
and religious observer of my word.” These assurances
were extremely agreeable to the parliament; and she re∣ceived
the thanks of both Houses. Addresses of congra∣tulation
were presented by the bishop and clergy of Lon∣don;
by the dissenters in and about that city; and, by all
the counties, cities, towns, and corporations of England.
She declared her attachment to the church: she promised
her protection to the dissenters; and received the com∣pliments
of all her subjects with such affability as insured
their affection.</P>
<P>§ II. William's death was no sooner known at the
Hague, than all Holland was filled with consternation.
The States immediately assembled, and, for some time,
gazed at each other in silent fear and astonishment. They
sighed, wept, and interchanged embraces and vows, that
they would act with unanimity, and expend their dearest
blood in defence of their country. Then they dispatched
<PB N="414" REF="420"/>
letters to the cities and provinces, informing them of this
unfortunate event, and exhorting them to union and per∣severance.
The express from England having brought
the Queen's speech to her privy-council, it was translated
and published, to revive the drooping spirits of the people.
Next day Pensionary Fagel imparted to the States of Hol∣land
a letter which he had received from the Earl of
Marlborough, containing assurances, in the Queen's name,
of union and assistance. In a few days, the Queen wrote
a letter in the French language to the States, confirming
these assurances: it was delivered by Mr. Stanhope, whom
she had furnished with fresh credentials as envoy from
England. Thus animated, the States resolved to prose∣cute
vigorous measures: their resolutions were still more
inspirited by the arrival of the Earl of Marlborough,
whom the Queen honoured with the order of the garter,
and invested with the character of ambassador extraordi∣nary
and plenipotentiary to the States-General: he was
likewise declared captain-general of her forces both at
home and abroad. He assured the States, that her Bri∣tannick
Majesty would maintain the alliances which had
been concluded by the late King, and do every thing that
the common concerns of Europe required. The speech
was answered by Dickvelt, president of the week, who,
in the name of the States, expressed their hearty thanks
to her Majesty, and their resolution of concurring with
her in a vigorous prosecution of the common interest.</P>
<P>§ III. The importance of William's life was evinced
by the joy that diffused itself through the kingdom of
France at the news of his decease. The person who first
brought the tidings to Calais was imprisoned by the gover∣nor,
until his information was confirmed. The court of
Versailles could hardly restrain their transports so as to
preserve common decorum: the people of Paris openly
rejoiced at the event: all decency was laid aside at Rome,
where this incident produced such indecent raptures, that
Cardinal Grimani, the Imperial minister, complained of
them to the Pope, as an insult on his master the Emperor,
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>
who was William's friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1701.</NOTE> confederate, and ally. The
French King dispatched credentials to Barre, whom the
Count D'Avaux had left at the Hague to manage the
affairs of France, together with instructions to renew the
negociation with the States, in hope of detaching them
from the alliance. This minister presented a memorial,
implying severe reflexions on King William, and the past
conduct of the Dutch; and insinuating, that now they had
recovered their liberty, the court of France hoped they
would consult their true interest. The Count de Goes,
envoy from the Emperor, animadverted on these expres∣sions
in another memorial, which was likewise published:
the States produced in publick an answer to the same re∣monstrance,
expressing their resentment at the insolence
of such insinuations, and their veneration for the memory
of their late Stadtholder. The Earl of Marlborough
succeeded in every part of his negociation. He anima∣ted
the Dutch to a full exertion of their vigour: he con∣certed
the operations of the campaign: he agreed with
the States-General and the Imperial minister, that war
should be declared against France on the same day, at
Vienna, London, and the Hague; and on the third of April
embarked for England, after having acquired the entire
confidence of those who governed the United Provinces.</P>
<P>§ IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1702.</NOTE> By this time the House of Commons in England
had settled the civil list upon the Queen for her life. When
the bill received the royal assent, she assured them, that one
hundred thousand pounds of this revenue should be applied
to the publick service of the current year: at the same
time, she passed another bill, for receiving and examining
the publick accounts. A commission for this purpose was
granted in the preceding reign, but had been for some years
discontinued; and, indeed, always proved ineffectual to
detect and punish those individuals who shamefully pil∣laged
their country. The villainy was so complicated, the
vice so general, and the delinquent so powerfully screened
by artifice and interest, as to elude all enquiry. On the
twenty-fourth day of March the oath of abjuration was

in her choice of ministers. Doctor John Sharp, Archbishop
of York, became her ghostly director and counsellor in al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ecclesiastical affairs. The Earl of Rochester was conti∣nued
Lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and enjoyed a great share
of her Majesty's confidence: the privy-seal was entrusted
to the Marquis of Normandy: the Earl of Nottingham
and Sir Charles Hedges were appointed Secretaries o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
State: the Earl of Abingdon, Viscount Weymouth, Lord
Dartmouth, Sir Christopher Musgrave, Grenville, Howe,
Gower, and Harcourt, were admitted as members of the
privy-council, together with Sir Edward Seymour, now
declared comptroller of the household. The Lord Godol∣phin
declined accepting the office of lord high-treasurer,
until he was over-ruled by the persuasions of Marl∣borough,
to whose eldest daughter his son was married.
This nobleman refused to command the forces abroad,
unless the Treasury should be put into the hands of Godol∣phin,
on whose punctuality in point of remittances
he knew he could depend. George Prince of Denmark,
was invested with the title of generalissimo of all the Queen's
forces by sea and land; and afterwards created lord high
admiral, the Earl of Pembroke having been dismissed
from this office with the offer of a large pension, which he
generously refused. Prince George, as admiral, was
assisted by a council, consisting of Sir George Rooke, Sir
David Mitchel, George Churchill, and Richard Hill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Though the legality of this board was doubted, the par∣liament
had such respect and veneration for the Queen,
that it was suffered to act without question.</P>
<P>§ V. A rivalship for the Queen's favour already appear∣ed
between the Earls of Rochester and Marlborough. The
former, as first cousin to the Queen, and chief of the Tory∣faction,
maintained considerable influence in the council <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
but even there the interest of his rival predominated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1702.</NOTE>
Marlborough was not only the better courtier, but, by
the canal of his countess, actually directed the Queen in
all her resolutions. Rochester proposed in council, that
the English should avoid a declaration of war with France,
and act as auxiliaries only. He was seconded by some
other members: but the opinion of Marlborough pre∣ponderated.
He observed, that the honour of the nation
was concerned to fulfil the late King's engagements; and
affirmed that France could never be reduced within due
bounds, unless the English would enter as principals in the
quarrel. This allegation was supported by the Dukes of
Somerset and Devonshire, the Earl of Pembroke, and the
majority of the council. The Queen being resolved to
declare war, communicated her intention to the House of
Commons, by whom it was approved; and on the fourth
day of May the declaration was solemnly proclaimed.
The King of France was, in this proclamation, taxed
with having taken possession of great part of the Spanish
dominions; with designing to invade the liberties of Eu∣rope,
and obstruct the freedom of navigation and com∣merce;
with having offered an unpardonable insult to
the Queen and her throne, by taking upon him to declare
the pretended Prince of Wales King of England, Scot∣land,
and Ireland. The three declarations of the Em∣peror,
England, and the States-General, which were
published in one day, did not fail to disconcert, as well as
to provoke, the French monarch. When his minister De
Torcy recited them in his hearing, he spoke of the Queen
with some acrimony; but with respect to the States-Ge∣neral,
he declared with great emotion, that “Messieurs
the Dutch merchants should one day repent of their in∣solence
and presumption, in declaring war against so
powerful a monarch:” he did not, however, produce
his declaration till the third day of July.</P>
<P>§ VI. The House of Commons, in compliance with the
Queen's desire, brought in a bill, empowering her Ma∣jesty
to name commissioners to treat with the Scots for an
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
union of the two kingdoms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1702.</NOTE> It met with warm oppo∣sition
from Sir Edward Seymour, and other Tory mem∣bers,
who discharged abundance of satire and ridicule upon
the Scottish nation: but the measure seemed so necessary at
that juncture, to secure the protestant succession against
the practices of France, and the claims of the Pretender,
that the majority espoused the bill, which passed through
both Houses, and on the sixth day of May received the
royal assent, together with some bills of less importance.
The enemies of the late King continued to revile his
memory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In their hour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of debauch, they drank to the health of Sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, meaning the hofse that sell with the King; and, under the appellation of the little gentleman in velvet, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted the mole that raised the hill over which the horse had slumbled. As the beast had formerly belonged to Sir John Fenwick, they insinuated that William's fate was a judgement upon him, for his cruelty to that gentleman; and a Latin epigram was written on the occasion.</NOTE> They even charged him with having formed
a design of excluding the Princess Anne from the throne,
and of introducing the Elector of Hanover as his own
immediate successor. This report had been so in∣dustriously
circulated, that it began to gain credit
all over the kingdom. Several Peers interested them∣selves
in William's character; and a motion was made
in the Upper House, that the truth of this report should
be enquired into. The House immediately desired that
those Lords who had visited the late King's papers
would intimate whether or not they had found any among
them relating to the Queen's succession, or to the succes∣sion
of the house of Hanover. They forthwith declared,
that nothing of that sort appeared. Then the House re∣solved,
That the report was groundless, false, villainous,
and scandalous, to the dishonour of the late King's me∣mory,
and highly tending to the disservice of her present
Majesty, whom they besought to give order that the authors
or publishers of such scandalous reports should be prose∣cuted
by the Attorney-General. The same censure was
passed upon some libels, and pamphlets, tending to inflame
the factions of the kingdom, and to propagate a spirit of
<PB N="419" REF="425"/>
irreligion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Binkes, in a sermon preached before the convocation, on the thirtieth day of January, drew a parallel between the sufferings of Christ, and those of King Charles, to which last he gave the preference, in point of right, character, and station.</NOTE>. On the twenty-first day of May, the Com∣mons,
in an address, advised her Majesty to engage the
Emperor, the States-General, and her other allies, to join
with her in prohibiting all intercourse with France and
Spain; and to concert such methods with the States-Ge∣neral
as might most effectually secure the trade of her
subjects and allies. The Lords presented another address,
desiring the Queen would encourage her subjects to equip
privateers, as the preparations of the enemy seemed to be
made for a piratical war, to the interruption of commerce:
they likewise exhorted her Majesty to grant commissions
or charters to all persons who should make such acquisi∣tions
in the Indies, as she in her great wisdom should
judge most expedient for the good of her kingdoms. On
the twenty-fifth day of May, the Queen having passed se∣veral
publick and<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">During this short session, the Queen gave her assent to an act for laying a duty upon land; to another for encouraging the Greenland trade: to a third for making good the deficiencies, and the publick credit: to a fourth for continuing the imprisonment of Counter, and other conspirators against King William▪ to a fifth for the relief of protestant purchasers of the forfeited es∣tates of Ireland; to a sixth enlarging the time for taking the oath of abjurati∣on; to a seventh obliging the Jews to maintain and provide for their protes∣tant children.</NOTE> private bills, dismissed the parliament
by prorogation, after having, in a short speech, thanked
them for their zeal, recommended unanimity, and declar∣ed
she would carefully preserve and maintain the act of
toleration.</P>
<P>§ VII. In Scotland, a warm contest arose between the
Revolutioners and those in the opposition, concerning the
existence of the present parliament. The Queen had sig∣nified
her accession to the throne, in a letter to her privy-council
for Scotland, desiring they would continue to act
in that office, until she should send a new commission.
Mean while she authorised them to publish a proclamation,
ordaining all officers of state, counsellors, and magistrates,
<PB N="420" REF="426"/>
to act in all things conformably to the commissions and
instructions of his late Majesty, until new commissions
should be prepared. She likewise assured them of her firm
resolution to protect them in their religion, laws, and li∣berties,
and in the established government of the church.
She had already, in presence of twelve Scottish counsel∣lors,
taken the coronation-oath for that kingdom: but
those who wanted to embroil the affairs of their country
affirmed, that this was an irregular way of proceeding, and
that the oath ought to have been tendered by persons de∣puted
for that purpose, either by the parliament, or the
privy-council of the kingdom. The present ministry,
consisting of the Duke of Queensberry, the Earls of March∣mont,
Melvil, Seafield, Hyndford, and Selkirk, were de∣voted
to Revolution principles, and desirous that the par∣liament
should continue in pursuance of a late act for con∣tinuing
the Parliament that should be then in being, six
months after the death of the King; and that it should
assemble in twenty days after that event. The Queen had,
by several adjournments, deferred the meeting almost three
months after the King's decease; and, therefore, the anti-revolutioners
affirmed that it was dissolved. The Duke
of Hamilton was at the head of this party, which cla∣moured
loudly for a new parliament. This noblemen,
together with the Marquis of Tweedale, the Earls Mar∣shal
and Rothes, and many other nobleman, repaired to
London, in order to make the Queen acquainted with their
objections to the continuance of the present parliament.
She admitted them to her presence, and calmly heard their
allegations: but she was determined, by the advice of her
privy-council for that kingdom, who were of opinion that
the nation was in too great a ferment to hazard the con∣vocation
of a new parliament. According to the Queen's
last adjournment, the parliament met at Edinburgh on the
ninth day of June, the Duke of Queensberry having been
appointed high-commissioner. Before the Queen's com∣mission
was read, the Duke of Hamilton, for himself and
his adherents, declared their satisfaction at her Majesty's
<PB N="421" REF="427"/>
accession to the throne, not only on account of her un∣doubted
right by descent, but likewise because of her ma∣ny
personal virtues and royal qualities. He said they were
resolved to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in defence of
her Majesty's right against all her enemies whatever; but
at the same time, they thought themselves bound in duty
to give their opinion, that they were not warranted by law
to sit and act as a parliament. He then read a paper to the
following effect: That forasmuch as, by the fundamental
laws and constitution of this kingdom, all parliaments do
dissolve on the death of the sovereign, except in so far as
innovated by an act in the preceding reign, that the par∣liament
in being at his Majesty's decease should meet, and
act what might be needful for the defence of the true pro∣testant
religion, as by law established; and for the main∣tenance
of the succession to the crown, as settled by the
claim of right; and for the preservation and security of
the publick peace: and seeing these ends are fully answered
by her Majesty's succession to the throne, we conceive
ourselves not now warranted by law to meet, sit, or act;
and, therefore, do dissent from anything that shall be done
or acted. The Duke having recited this paper, and for∣mally
protested against the proceedings of the parliament,
withdrew with seventy-nine members, amidst the accla∣mations
of the people.</P>
<P>§ VIII. Notwithstanding their secession, their commis∣sioner,
who retained a much greater number, produced
the Queen's letter, signifying her resolution to maintain
and protect her subjects in the full possession of their re∣ligion,
laws, liberties, and the presbyterian discipline.
She informed them of her having declared war against
France: she exhorted them to provide competent supplies
for maintaining such a number of forces as might be neces∣sary
for disappointing the enemy's designs, and preserving
the present happy settlement; and she earnestly recom∣mended
to their consideration an union of the two king∣doms.
The Duke of Queensberry and the Earl of March∣mont
having enforced the different articles of this letter,
<PB N="422" REF="428"/>
committees were appointed for the security of the kingdom,
for controverted elections, for drawing up an answer to her
Majesty's letter, and for revising the minutes. Meanwhile,
the Duke of Hamilton and his adherents sent the Lord
Blantyre to London, with an address to the Queen, who
refused to receive it, but wrote another letter to the par∣liament,
expressing her resolution to maintain their digni∣ty
and authority against all opposers. They, in answer to
the former, had assured her, that the groundless secession
of some members should increase and strengthen their
care and zeal for her Majesty's service. They expelled Sir
Alexander Bruce, for having given vent to some reflections
against Presbytery. The Lord Advocate prosecuted the
faculty of advocates before the parliament, for having
passed a vote among themselves in favour of the protesta∣tion
and address of the dissenting members. The faculty
was severely reprimanded: but the whole nation seemed
to resent the prosecution. The parliament passed an act for
recognizing her Majesty's royal authority: another for ad∣journing
the court of judicature called the session: a third
for declaring this meeting of parliament legal: and for∣bidding
any person to disown, quarrel, or impugn, the
dignity and authority thereof, under the penalty of high
treason: a fourth for securing the true protestant religion
and presbyterian church government: a fifth for a land
tax: and a sixth enabling her Majesty to appoint commis∣sioners
for an union between the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>§ IX. The Earl of Marchmont, of his own accord, and
even contrary to the advice of the high-commissioner,
brought in a bill for abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales:
but this was not supported by the court-party, as the com∣missioner
had no instructions how to act on the occasion.
Perhaps the Queen and her English ministry resolved to
keep the succession open in Scotland, as a check upon the
Whigs and house of Hanover. On the thirtieth day of
June, the commissioner adjourned the parliament, after
having thanked them for their chearfulness and unanimity
in their proceedings; and the chiefs of the opposite parties
<PB N="423" REF="429"/>
hastened to London, to make their different representations
to the Queen and her ministry. In the mean time, she
appointed commissioners for treating about the union; and
they met at the cockpit on the twenty-second day of
October. On the twentieth day of the next month, they
adjusted preliminaries, importing, That nothing agreed on
among themselves should be binding, except ratified by
her Majesty and the respective parliaments of both nations;
and that, unless all the heads proposed for the treaty were
agreed to, no particular thing agreed on should be binding.
The Queen visited them in December, in order to quicken
their mutual endeavours. They agreed, that the two
kingdoms should be inseparably united into one monarchy,
under her Majesty, her heirs, and successors, and under
the same limitations, according to the acts of settlement:
but, when the Scottish commissioners proposed that the
rights and privileges of their company trading to Africa and
the Indies should be preserved and maintained, such a
difficulty arose as could not be surmounted, and no further
progress was made in this commission. The tranquillity of
Ireland was not interrupted by any new commotion. That
kingdom was ruled by justices whom the Earl of Roches∣ter
had appointed; and the trustees for the forfeited estates
maintained their authority.</P>
<P>§ X. While Britain was engaged in these civil trans∣actions,
her allies were not idle on the continent. The
old Duke of Zell, and his nephew, the Elector of Bruns∣wick,
surprised the Dukes of Wolfenbuttle and Saxe-Gotha,
whom they compelled to renounce their attach∣ments
to France, and concur in the common councils of
the empire. Thus the north of Germany was re-united
in the interest of the confederates; and the princes would
have been in a condition to assist them effectually, had
not the neighbourhood of the war in Poland deterred
them from parting with their forces. England and the
States-General endeavoured in vain to mediate a peace
between the Kings of Sweden and Poland. Charles was
become enamoured of war, and ambitious of conquest.
<PB N="424" REF="430"/>
He threatened to invade Saxony through the dominions
of Prussia. Augustus retired to Cracow, while Charles
penetrated to Warsaw, and even ordered the Cardinal∣primate
to summon a diet for choosing a new king. The
situation of affairs, at this juncture, was far from being
favourable to the allies. The court of Vienna had tam∣pered
in vain with the Elector of Bavaria, who made use
of this negociation to raise his terms with Louis. His
brother, the Elector of Cologn, admitted French garri∣sons
into Liege, and all his places on the Rhine. The
Elector of Saxony was too hard pressed by the King of
Sweden, to spare his full proportion of troops to the allies:
the King of Prussia was over-awed by the vicinity of the
Swedish conqueror: the Duke of Savoy had joined his
forces to those of France, and over-run the whole state
of Milan; and the Pope, though he professed a neutrality,
evinced himself strongly biassed to the French interests.</P>
<P>§ XI. The war was begun in the name of the Elector
Palatine with the siege of Keiserswaert, which was in∣vested
in the month of April by the Prince of Nassau-Saarbrugh,
mareschal-du-camp to the Emperor: under
this officer the Dutch troops served as auxiliaries, because
war had not yet been declared by the States-General.
The French garrison made a desperate defence. They
worsted the besiegers in divers sallies, and maintained the
place until it was reduced to a heap of ashes. At length
the allies made a general attack upon the counterscarp
and ravelin, which they carried after a very obstinate en∣gagement,
with the loss of two thousand men. Then
the garrison capitulated on honourable terms, and
the fortifications were razed. During this siege, which
lasted from the eighteenth day of April to the middle of
June, Count Tallard posted himself on the opposite side of
the Rhine, from whence he supplied the town with fresh
troops and ammunition, and annoyed the besiegers with
his artillery: but finding it impossible to save the place,
he joined the grand army, commanded by the Duke of
Burgundy in the Netherlands. The siege of Keiserswaert
<PB N="425" REF="431"/>
was covered by a body of Dutch troops under the Earl of
Athlone, who lay encamped in the duchy of Cleve. Mean
while General Coehorn, at the head of another detach∣ment,
entered Flanders, demolished the French lines be∣tween
the forts of Donat and Isabella, and laid the cha∣tellanie
of Bruges under contribution: but a considerable
body of French troops advancing under the Marquis de
Bedmar, and the Count de la Motte, he overflowed the
country, and retired under the walls of Sluys. The Duke
of Burgundy, who had taken the command of the French
army under Boufflers, encamped at Zanten, near Cleve,
and laid a scheme for surprising Nimeguen; in which,
however, he was baffled by the vigilance and activity of
Athlone, who, guessing his design, marched thither and
encamped under the cannon of the town. In the begin∣ning
of June, Landau was invested by Prince Louis of
Baden: in July, the King of the Romans arrived in the
camp of the besiegers, with such pomp and magnificence
as exhausted his father's treasury. On the ninth day of
September, the citadel was taken by assault; and then the
town surrendered.</P>
<P>§ XII. When the Earl of Marlborough arrived in Hol∣land,
the Earl of Athlone, in quality of veldt-mareschal,
insisted upon an equal command with the English gene∣ral:
but the States obliged him to yield this point in favour
of Marlborough, whom they declared generalissimo of all
their forces. In the beginning of July he repaired to the
camp at Nimeguen, where he soon assembled an army of
sixty thousand men, well provided with all necessaries;
then he convoked a council of the general officers, to con∣cert
the operations of the campaign. On the sixteenth
day of the month he passed the Maese, and encamped at
Over-asselt, within two leagues and a half of the enemy,
who had entrenched themselves between Goch and Genap.
He afterwards repassed the river below the Grave, and re∣moved
to Gravenbroc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, where he was joined by the
British train of artillery from Holland. On the second
day of August, he advanced to Petit Brugel, and the
<PB N="426" REF="432"/>
French retired before him, leaving Spanish Guelderland
to his discretion. He had resolved to hazard an engage∣ment,
and issued orders accordingly: but he was restrain∣ed
by the Dutch deputies, who were afraid of their own
interest, in case the battle should have proved unfortunate.
The Duke of Burgundy finding himself obliged to retreat
before the allied army, rather than expose himself longer
to such a mortifying indignity, returned to Versailles,
leaving the command to Boufflers, who lost the confi∣dence
of Louis by the ill-success of this campaign. The
deputies of the States-General having represented to the
Earl of Marlborough the advantages that would accrue
to Holland, from his dispossessing the enemy of the places
they maintained in the Spanish Guelderland, by which the
navigation of the Maese was obstructed, and the impor∣tant
town of Maestricht in a manner blocked up, he re∣solved
to deliver them from such a troublesome neigh∣bourhood.
He detached General Schultz with a body of
troops to reduce the town and castle of Werk, which were
surrendered after a slight resistance. In the beginning of
September, he undertook the siege of Venlo, which capi∣tulated
on the twenty-fifth day of the month, after fort
St. Michael had been stormed and taken by Lord Cutts
and the English volunteers, among whom the young Earl
of Huntingdon distinguished himself by very extraordinary
acts of valour. Then the General invested Ruremonde,
which he reduced after a very obstinate defence, together
with the fort of Stevensuaert, situated on the same river.
Boufslers, confounded at the rapidity of Marlborough's
success, retired towards Liege, in order to cover that city:
but, at the approach of the confederates, he retired with
precipitation to Tongeren, from whence he directed his
route towards Brabant, with a view to defend such places
as the allies had no design to attack. When the Earl of
Marlborough arrived at Liege, he found the suburbs of St.
Walburgh had been set on fire by the French garrison,
who had retired into the citadel and the Chartreux The
allies took immediate possession of the city; and in a few
<PB N="427" REF="433"/>
days opened the trenches against the citadel, which was
taken by assault. On this occasion, the Hereditary Prince
of Hesse-Cassel charged the head of the grenadiers, and
was the first person who mounted the breach. Violani
the governor, and the Duke of Charost, were made priso∣ners.
Three hundred thousand florins in gold and silver
were found in the citadel, besides notes for above one
million, drawn upon substantial merchants in Liege,
who paid the money. Immediately after this exploit, the
garrison of the Chartreux capitulated on honourable
terms, and were conducted to Antwerp. By the success
of this campaign, the Earl of Marlborough raised his mi∣litary
character above all censure, and confirmed himself
in the entire confidence of the States-General, who, in the
beginning of the season, had trembled for Nimeguen, and
now saw the enemy driven back into their own domains.</P>
<P>§ XIII. When the army broke up in November, the
General repaired to Maestricht, from whence he proposed
to return to the Hague by water. Accordingly, he em∣barked
in a large boat, with five-and-twenty soldiers,
under the command of a lieutenant. Next morning he
was joined at Ruremonde by Cochorn, in a larger vessel,
with sixty men; and they were moreover escorted by fifty
troopers who rode along the bank of the river. The large
boat out-sailed the other, and the horsemen mistook their
way in the dark. A French partizan, with five and thirty
men from Gueldres, who lurked among the rushes in wait
for prey, seised the rope by which the boat was drawn,
hauled it ashore, discharged their small arms and hand-grenades,
then rushing into it, secured the soldiers before
they could put themselves in a posture of defence. The
Earl of Marlborough was accompanied by General Opdam,
and Mynheer Gueldermalsen, one of the deputies, who
were provided with passports. The Earl had neglected
this precaution: but recollecting he had an old passport
for his brother General Churchill, he produced it without
any emotion; and the partizan was in such confusion that
he never examined the date. Nevertheless, he rifled their
<PB N="428" REF="434"/>
baggage, carried off the guard as prisoners, and allowed
the boat to proceed. The Governor of Venlo receiving in∣formation
that the Earl was surprised by a party, and con∣veyed
to Gueldres, immediately marched out with his
whole garrison to invest that place. The same imperfect
account being transmitted to Holland, filled the whole
province with consternation. The States forthwith assem∣bling,
resolved that all their forces should march immedi∣ately
to Gueldres, and threaten the garrison of the place
with the utmost extremities, unless they would immedi∣ately
deliver the General. But before these orders could
be dispatched, the Earl arrived at the Hague, to the in∣expressible
joy of the people, who already looked upon
him as their faviour and protector.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The French arms were not quite so unfortunate
on the Rhine as in Flanders. The Elector of Bavaria sur∣prised
the city of Ulm in Suabia, by a stratagem, and
then declared for France, which had by this time comply∣ed
with all his demands. The diet of the empire assembled
at Ratisbon were so incensed at his conduct in seizing the
city of Ulm by persidy, that they presented a memorial
to his Imperial Majesty, requesting he would proceed against
the Elector, according to the constitutions of the empire.
They resolved by a plurality of voices to declare war, in the
name of the empire, against the French King and the Duke
of Anjou, for having invaded several fiefs of the empire in Ita∣ly,
the archbishoprick of Cologn, and the diocese of Liege:
and they forbad the ministers of Bavaria and Cologn to
appear in the general diet. In vain did these powers pro∣test
against their proceedings. The empire's declaration
of war was published and notified, in the name of the
diet, to the Cardinal of Limberg, the Emperor's commis∣sioner.
Mean while the French made themselves masters of
Neuburgh, in the circle of Suabia, while Louis Prince of Ba∣den,
being weakened by sending off detachments, was oblig∣ed
to lie inactive in his camp near Fridlinguen. The French
army was divided into two bodies, commanded by the Mar∣quis
de Villars and the Count de Guiscard; and the Prince,
<PB N="429" REF="435"/>
thinking himself in danger of being enclosed by the enemy,
resolved to decamp. Villars immediately passed the Rhine,
to fall upon him in his retreat; and an obstinate engage∣ment
ensuing, the Imperialists were overpowered by num∣bers.
The Prince having lost two thousand men, aban∣doned
the field of battle to the enemy, together with his
baggage, artillery, and ammunition, and retired towards
Stauffen, without being pursued. The French army,
even after they had gained the battle, were unaccountably
seised with such a panick, that if the Imperial general had
faced them with two regiments, he would have snatched
the victory from Villars, who was upon this occasion sa∣luted
mareschal of France by the soldiers; and next day
the town of Fridlinguen surrendered. The Prince being
joined by some troops under General Thungen, and other
re-enforcements, resolved to give battle to the enemy:
but Villars declined an engagement, and repassed the
Rhine. Towards the latter end of October, Count Tallard,
and the Marquis de Lomarie, with a body of eighteen
thousand men, reduced Triers and Traerbach: on the
other hand, the Prince of Hesse-Cassel, with a detachment
from the allied army at Liege, retook from the French
the towns of Zinch, Lintz, Brisac, and Andernach.</P>
<P>§ XV. In Italy, Prince Eugene laboured under a total ne∣glect
of the Imperial court, where his enemies, on pretence
of supporting the King of the Romans in his first cam∣paign,
weaned the Emperor's attention entirely from his
affairs on the other side of the Alps; so that he left his
best army to moulder away for want of recruits and re∣enforcements.
The Prince, thus abandoned, could not
prevent the Duke de Vendome from relieving Mantua,
and was obliged to relinquish some other places he had
taken. Philip King of Spain, being inspired with the am∣bition
of putting an end to the war in this country, sailed
in person for Naples, where he was visited by the Cardinal∣legate,
with a compliment from the Pope; yet he could
not obtain the investiture of the kingdom from his holi∣ness.
The Emperor, however, was so disgusted at the em∣bassy
<PB N="430" REF="436"/>
which the Pope had sent to Philip, that he ordered
his ambassador at Rome to withdraw. Philip proceeded
from Naples to Final, under convoy of the French fleet
which had brought him to Italy: Here he had an inter∣view
with the Duke of Savoy, who began to be alarmed
at the prospect of the French King's being master of the
Milanese; and, in a letter to the Duke of Vendome, he
forbade him to engage Prince Eugene until he himself
should arrive in the camp. Prince Eugene, understanding
that the French army intended to attack Luzzara and
Guastalla, passed the Po, with an army of about half the
number of the enemy, and posted himself behind the dyke
of Zero, in such a manner that the French were ignorant
of his situation. He concluded, that on their arrival at the
ground they had chosen, the horse would march out to
forage, while the rest of the army would be employed in
pitching tents, and providing for their refreshment. His
design was to seize that opportunity of attacking them,
not doubting that he should obtain a complete victory:
but he was disappointed by mere accident. An adjutant,
with an advanced guard, had the curiosity to ascend the
dyke, in order to view the country, when he discovered
the Imperial infantry lying on their faces, and the horse
in the rear, ranged in order of battle. The French camp
was immediately alarmed; and as the intermediate ground
was covered with hedges, which obliged the assailants to
defile, the enemy were in a posture of defence before the
Imperialists could advance to action: nevertheless, the
Prince attacked them with great vivacity, in hopes of
disordering their line, which gave way in several places:
but night interposing, he was obliged to desist; and in a
few days the French reduced Luzzara and Guastalla.
The Prince, however, maintained his posts, and Philip
returned to Spain without having obtained any considera∣ble
advantage.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The French King employed all his artifice and
intrigues in raising up new enemies against the confede∣rates.
He is said to have bribed Count Mansfield, presi∣dent
of the council of war at Vienna, to withhold the sup∣plies
<PB N="431" REF="437"/>
from Prince Eugene in Italy. At the Ottoman
Porte he had actually gained over the Visir, who engaged
to renew the war with the Emperor. But the Mufti and
all the other great officers were averse to this design, and
the Visir fell a sacrifice to their resentment. Louis conti∣nued
to embroil the kingdom of Poland by means of the
Cardinal Primate. The young King of Sweden advanced
to Lissau, where he defeated Augustus. Then he took pos∣session
of Cracow, and raised contributions; nor could he
be persuaded to retreat, although the Muscovites and
Lithuanians had ravaged Livonia, and even made an ir∣ruption
into Sweden.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The operations of the combined squadrons at
sea did not fully answer the expectations of the publick.
On the twelfth day of May, Sir John Munden sailed with
twelve ships, to intercept a French squadron appointed as
a convoy to a new viceroy of Mexico, from Corunna to
the West Indies. On the twenty-eighth day of the month,
he chased fourteen sail of French ships into Corunna.
Then he called a council of war, in which it was agreed,
that as the place was strongly fortified, and by the intel∣ligence
they had received, it appeared that seventeen of
the enemy's ships of war rode at anchor in the harbour,
it would be expedient for them to follow the latter part of
their instructions, by which they were directed to cruise
in soundings for the protection of the trade. They returned
accordingly, and being distressed by want of provisions,
came into port, to the general discontent of the nation.
For the satisfaction of the people, Sir John Munden was
tried by a court-martial, and acquitted: but as this mis∣carriage
had rendered him very unpopular, Prince George
dismissed him from the service. We have already hinted,
that King William had projected a scheme to reduce Ca∣diz,
with intention to act afterwards against the Spanish
settlements in the West-Indies. This design Queen Anne
resolved to put in execution. Sir George Rooke com∣manded
the fleet, and the Duke of Ormond was appointed
general of the land-forces destined for this expedition.
<PB N="432" REF="438"/>
The combined squadrons amounted to fifty ships of the
line, exclusive of frigates, fire-ships, and smaller vessels;
and the number of soldiers embarked was not far short of
fourteen thousand. In the latter end of June the fleet sailed
from St. Helen's: on the twelfth of August they an∣chored
at the distance of two leagues from Cadiz. Next
day the Duke of Ormond summoned the Duke de Bran∣caccio,
who was governor, to submit to the House of
Austria; but that officer answered, he would acquit him∣self
honourably of the trust reposed in him by the King.
On the fifteenth the Duke of Ormond landed with his for∣ces
in the bay of Bulls, under cover of a smart fire from
some frigates, and repulsed a body of Spanish cavalry:
then he summoned the governor of Fort St. Catharine's
to surrender; and received an answer, importing, that
the garrison was prepared for his reception. A declaration
was published in the Spanish language, intimating, that
the allies did not come as enemies to Spain; but only to
free them from the yoke of France, and assist them in es∣tablishing
themselves under the government of the House
of Austria. These professions produced very little effect
among the Spaniards, who were either cooled in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at∣tachment
to that family, or provoked by the excesses of
the English troops: These having taken possession of Fort
St. Catharine, and Port St. Mary's, instead of protecting,
plundered the natives, notwithstanding the strict orders
issued by the Duke of Ormond, to prevent this scanda∣lous
practice: even some general officers were concerned
in the pillage. A battery was raised against Montagorda∣fort
opposite to the Puntal: but the attempt miscarried,
and the troops were re-embarked.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Captain Hardy having been sent to water in
Lagos-bay, received intelligence that the galleons from
the West-Indies had put into Vigo, under convoy of a
French squadron. He sailed immediately in quest of
Sir George Rooke, who was now on his voyage back to
England, and falling in with him on the sixth day
of October, communicated the substance of what he
<PB N="433" REF="439"/>
had learned. Rooke immediately called a council of war,
in which it was determined to alter their course, and attack
the enemy at Vigo. He forthwith detached some small
vessels for intelligence, and received a confirmation, that
the galleons, and the squadron commanded by Chateau
Renault, were actually in the harbour. They sailed thither,
and appeared before the place on the eleventh day of
October. The passage into the harbour was narrow, se∣cured
by batteries, forts, and breast-works on each side;
by a strong boom, consisting of iron chains, topmasts, and
cables, moored at each end to a seventy-gun ship; and forti∣fied
within by five ships of the same strength, lying athwart
the channel, with their broad-sides to the offing. As the
first and second rates of the combined fleets were too large
to enter, the admirals shifted their flags into smaller ships;
and a division of five-and-twenty English and Dutch ships
of the line, with their frigates, fireships, and ketches, was
destined for these rvice. In order to facilitate the attack,
the Duke of Ormond landed with five-and-twenty hundred
men, at the distance of six miles from Vigo, and took by
assault a fort and platform of forty pieces of cannon, at the
entrance of the harbour. The British ensign was no sooner
seen flying at the top of this fort, than the ships ad∣vanced
to the attack. Vice-Admiral Hopson, in the Tor∣bay,
crowding all his sail, ran directly against the boom,
which was broken by the first shock: then the whole
squadron entered the harbour, through a prodigious fire
from the enemy's ships and batteries. These last, how∣ever,
were soon stormed and taken by the grenadiers who
had been landed. The great ships lay against the forts at
each side of the harbour, which in a little time they
silenced; though Vice-Admiral Hopson narrowly escaped
from a fireship by which he was boarded. After a very
vigorous engagement, the French, finding themselves un∣able
to cope with such an adversary, resolved to destroy
their ships and galleons, that they might not fall into the
hands of the victors. They accordingly burned and ran
ashore eight ships and as many advice-boats; but ten
<PB N="434" REF="440"/>
ships of war were taken, together with eleven galleons.
Though they had secured the best part of their plate and
merchandise before the English fleet arrived, the value of
fourteen millions of pieces of eight, in plate and rich
commodities, was destroyed in six galleons that perished;
and about half that value was brought off by the conque∣rors:
so that this was a dreadful blow to the enemy, and a
noble-acquisition to the allies. Immediately after this ex∣ploit
Sir George Rooke was joined by Sir Cloudesley
Shovel, who had been sent out with a squadron to inter∣cept
the galleons. This officer was left to bring home the
prizes, and dismantle the fortifications, while Rooke re∣turned
in triumph to England.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The glory which the English acquired in this
expedition was in some measure tarnished by the conduct
of some officers in the West Indies. Thither Admiral
Benbow had been detached with a squadron of ten sail, in
the course of the preceding year. At Jamaica he received
intelligence, that Monsieur Du Casse was in the neigh∣bourhood
of Hispaniola, and resolved to beat up to that
island. At Leogane he fell in with a French ship of fifty
guns, which her captain ran ashore and blew up. He
took several other vessels, and having alarmed Petit-Gua∣vas,
bore away for Donna Maria bay, where he under∣stood
that Du Casse had sailed for the coast of Cartha∣gena.
Benbow resolved to follow the same course; and
on the nineteenth of August discovered the enemy's squa∣dron
near St. Martha, consisting of ten fail, steering along
shore. He formed the line, and an engagement enfued,
in which he was very ill seconded by some of his captains.
Nevertheless, the battle continued till night, and he de∣termined
to renew it next morning, when he perceived all
his ships at the distance of three or four miles astern, ex∣cept
the Ruby, commanded by Captain George Walton,
who joined him in plying the enemy with chase-guns.
On the twenty-first these two ships engaged the French
squadron; and the Ruby was so disabled, that the Ad∣miral
was obliged to send her back to Jamaica. Next day
<PB N="435" REF="441"/>
the Greenwich, commanded by Wade, was five leagues
astern: and the wind changing, the enemy had the ad∣vantage
of the weather-gage. On the twenty-third the
Admiral renewed the battle with his single ship, unsu∣stained
by the rest of the squadron. On the twenty-fourth
his leg was shattered by a chain-shot; notwithstanding
which accident, he remained on the quarter-deck in a
cradle, and continued the engagement. One of the largest
ships of the enemy lying like a wreck upon the water, four
sail of the English squadron poured their broadsides into
her, and then ran to leeward, without paying any regard
to the signal for battle. Then the French bearing down
upon the Admiral with their whole force, shot away his
main-top-sail-yard, and damaged his rigging in such a
manner, that he was obliged to lie by and resit, while
they took their disabled ship in tow. During this interval,
he called a council of his captains, and expostulated with
them on their behaviour. They observed, that the French
were very strong, and advised him to desist. He plainly
perceived that he was betrayed, and with the utmost re∣luctance
returned to Jamaica, having not only lost a leg,
but also received a large wound in his face, and another in
his arm, while he in person attempted to board the French
admiral. Exasperated at the treachery of his captains, he
granted a commission to Rear. Admiral Whetstone, and
other officers, to hold a court-martial, and try them for
cowardice. Hudson, of the Pendennis, died before his
trial: Kirby and Wade were convicted, and sentenced to
be shot: Constable, of the Windsor, was cashiered and
imprisoned: Vincent, of the Falmouth, and Fogg, the
Admiral's own captain of the Breda, were convicted of
having signed a paper, that they would not sight under
Benbow's command: but, as they behaved gallantly in the
action, the court inflicted upon them no other punishment,
than that of a provisional suspension. Captain Walton
had likewise joined in the conspiracy while he was heated
with the sumes of intoxication: but he afterwards re∣nounced
the engagement, and fought with admirable cou∣rage
<PB N="436" REF="442"/>
until his ship was disabled. The boisterous manners
of Benbow had produced this base confederacy. He was
a rough seaman; but remarkably brave, honest, and ex∣perienced
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When one of his lieutenants expressed his sorrow for the loss of the Admiral's leg, “I am sorry for it, too (replied the gallant Benbow) but I had rather have lost them both than have seen this dishonour brought upon the English nation. But, do you hear? If another shot should take me off, behave like brave men, and fight it out.”—When Du Casse arrived at Carthagena, he wrote a letter to Benbow to this effect:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I Had little hope on Monday last but to have supped in your cabin; but it pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up; for, by God, they deserve it.” Your's,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>DU CASSF.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P></NOTE>. He took this miscarriage so much to heart,
that he became melancholy, and his grief co-operating
with the fever occasioned by his wounds, put a period to
his life. Wade and Kirby were sent home in the Bristol;
and, on their arrival at Plymouth, shot on board of the
ship, by virtue of a dead warrant for their immediate exe∣cution,
which had lain there for some time. The same
precaution had been taken in all the western ports, in or∣der
to prevent applications in their favour.</P>
<P>§ XX. During these transactions, the Queen seemed
to be happy in the affection of her subjects. Though the
continuance of the parliament was limited to six months
after the King's decease, she dissolved it by proclamation
before the term was expired: and issued writs for electing
another, in which the Tory interest predominated. In
the summer the Queen gave audience to the Count de
Platens, envoy extraordinary from the Elector of Hanover:
then she made a progress with her husband to Oxford,
Bath, and Bristol, where she was received with all the
marks of the most genuine affection. The new parliament
meeting on the twentieth day of October, Mr. Harley
was chosen speaker. The Queen in her speech declared,
she had summoned them to assist her in carrying on the
just and necessary war in which the nation was engaged.
She desired the Commons would inspect the accounts of
<PB N="437" REF="443"/>
the publick receipts and payments, that if any abuses had
crept into the management of the finances, they might be
detected, and the offenders punished. She told them,
that the funds assigned in the last parliament had not pro∣duced
the sums granted; and that the deficiency was not
supplied even by the hundred thousand pounds which she
had paid from her own revenue for the publick service,
She expressed her concern for the disappointment at Cadiz,
as well as for the abuses committed at port St. Mary's
which had obliged her to give directions for the strictest
examination of the particulars. She hoped they would
find time to consider of some better and more effectual me∣thod
to prevent the exportation of wool, and improve that
manufacture, which she was determined to encourage.
She professed a firm persuasion, that the affection of her
subjects was the surest pledge of their duty and obedience.
She promised to defend and maintain the church as by law
established; and to protect her subjects in the full enjoy∣ments
of all their rights and liberties. She protested, that
she relied on their care of her: she said her interest and
their's were inseparable; and that her endeavours should
never be wanting to make them all safe and happy.—She
was presented with a very affectionate address from either
House, congratulating her upon the glorious success of her
arms, and those of her allies, under the command of the
Earl of Marlborough: but that of the Commons was
distinguished by an implicated reproach on the late reign,
importing, that the wonderful progress of her Majesty's
arms under the Earl of Marlborough had signally “re∣trieved”
the ancient honour and glory of the English
nation. This expression had excited a warm debate in the
House, in the course of which many severe reflections were
made on the memory of King William. At length, the
question was put, Whether the word “Retrieved” should
remain? and carried in the affirmative, by a majority of
one hundred.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The strength of the Tories appeared in nothing
more conspicuous than in their enquiry concerning con∣troverted
<PB N="438" REF="444"/>
elections. The borough of Hindon, near Salisbury,
was convicted of bribery, and a bill brought in for dis∣franchising
the town: yet, no vote passed against the
person who exercised this corruption, because he hap∣pened
to be a Tory. Mr. Howe was declared duely elect∣ed
for Gloucestershire, though the majority of the electors
had voted for the other candidate. Sir John Packington
exhibited a complaint against the Bishop of Worcester
and his son, for having endeavoured to prevent his election:
the Commons having taken it into consideration, resolved,
that the proceedings of William Lord Bishop of Wor∣cester,
and his son, had been malicious, unchristian, and
arbitrary, in high violation of the liberties and privi∣leges
of the Commons of England. They voted an address
to the Queen, desiring her to remove the father from the
office of lord-almoner; and they ordered the Attorney-General
to prosecute the son, after his privilege as member
of the convocation should be expired. A counter-address
was immediately voted, and presented by the Lords, be∣seeching
her Majesty would not remove the Bishop of
Worcester from the place of lord-almoner, until he should
be found guilty of some crime by due course of law; as it
was the undoubted right of every lord of parliament, and
of every subject of England, to have an opportunity to
make his defence before he suffers any sort of punishment.
The Queen said she had not as yet received any complaint
against the Bishop of Worcester: but she looked upon it
as her undoubted right to continue or displace any servant
attending upon her own person, when she should think
proper. The Peers having received this answer, unani∣mously
resolved, That no lord of their House ought to
suffer any sort of punishment by any proceedings of the
House of Commons, otherwise than according to the known
and ancient rules and methods of parliament. When the
Commons attended the Queen with their address against
the Bishop, she said she was sorry there was occasion for
such a remonstrance, and that the Bishop of Worcester
should no longer continue to supply the place of her
<PB N="439" REF="445"/>
almoner. This regard to their address was a flagrant
proof of her partiality to the Tories, who seemed to justify
her attachment by their compliance and liberality.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In deliberating on the supplies, they agreed
to all the demands of the ministry. They voted forty
thousand seamen, and the like number of land forces, to
act in conjunction with those of the allies. For the
maintenance of these last, they granted eight hundred
and thirty-three thousand eight hundred and twenty-six
pounds; besides three hundred and fifty thousand pounds
for guards and garrisons; seventy thousand nine hundred and
seventy-three pounds for ordnance; and fifty-one thousand
eight hundred and forty-three pounds for subsidies to the
allies. Lord Shannon arriving with the news of the
success at Vigo, the Queen appointed a day of thanksgiv∣ing
for the signal success of her arms under the Earl of
Marlborough, the Duke of Ormond, and Sir George
Rooke; and, on that day, which was the twelfth of No∣vember,
she went in state to St. Paul's church, attended
by both Houses of Parliament. Next day the Peers voted
the thanks of their House to the Duke of Ormond for
his services at Vigo; and, at the same time, drew up an
address to the Queen, desiring she would order the Duke
of Ormond and Sir George Rooke to lay before them an
account of their proceedings: a request with which her
Majesty complied. Those two officers were likewise thank∣ed
by the House of Commons: Vice-Admiral Hopson was
knighted, and gratified with a considerable pension. The
Duke of Ormond, at his return from the expedition, com∣plained
openly of Rooke's conduct, and seemed determined
to subject him to a publick accusation: but that officer was
such a favourite among the Commons, that the court was
afraid to disoblige them by an impeachment, and took great
pains to mitigate the Duke's resentment. This nobleman
was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and Rooke was
admitted into the privy-council. A motion, however,
being made in the House of Lords, that the Admiral's in∣structions
and journals relating to the last expedition might
be examined, a committee was appointed for that purpose,
<PB N="440" REF="446"/>
and prepared an unfavourable report: but it was rejected
by a majority of the House; and they voted, That Sir
George Rooke had done his duty, pursuant to the councils
of war, like a brave officer, to the honour of the British
nation.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. On the twenty-first day of November, the
Queen sent a message to the House of Commons by Mr.
Secretary Hedges, recommending further provision for the
Prince her husband, in case he should survive her. This
message being considered, Mr. Howe moved, That the
yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds should be
settled on the Prince, in case he should survive her Majesty.
No opposition was made to the proposal: but warm de∣bates
were excited by a clause in the bill, exempting the
Prince from that part of the act of succession by which
strangers, though naturalized, were rendered incapable
of holding employments. This clause related only to
those who should be naturalized in a future reign;
and indeed was calculated as a restriction upon the
House of Hanover. Many members argued against
the clause of exemption, because it seemed to imply,
that persons already naturalized would be excluded from
employments in the next reign, though already possessed
of the right of natural-born subjects, a consequence plainly
contradictory to the meaning of the act. Others opposed
it, because the Lords had already resolved by a vote, That
they would never pass any bill sent up from the Commons,
to which a clause foreign to the bill should be tacked; and
this clause they affirmed to be a tack, as an incapacity to
hold employments was a circumstance altogether distinct
from a settlement in money. The Queen expressed un∣common
eagerness in behalf of this bill; and the court in∣fluence
was managed so successfully, that it passed through
both Houses, though not without an obstinate opposition,
and a formal protest by seven-and-twenty peers.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The Earl of Marlborough arriving in Eng∣land
about the latter end of November, received the thanks
of the Commons for his great and signal services, which
were so acceptable to the Queen, that she created him a
<PB N="441" REF="447"/>
Duke, gratified him with a pension of five thousand
pounds upon the revenue of the Post-Office during his
natural life; and, in a message to the Commons, expressed
a desire, that they would find some method to settle it on
the heirs male of his body. This intimation was produc∣tive
of warm debates, during which Sir Christopher
Musgrave observed, that he would not derogate from the
Duke's eminent services: but he affirmed his grace had
been very well paid for them, by the profitable employ∣ments
which he and his duchess enjoyed. The Duke, un∣derstanding
that the Commons were heated by the sub∣ject,
begged her Majesty would rather forego her gracious
message in his behalf, than create any uneasiness on his
account, which might embarrass her affairs, and be of ill
consequence to the publick. Then she sent another mes∣sage
to the House, signifying, that the Duke of Marl∣borough
had declined her interposition. Notwithstand∣ing
this declaration, the Commons in a body presented
an address, acknowledging the eminent services of the
Duke of Marlborough, yet expressing their apprehension
of making a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown,
which had been so much reduced by the exorbitant
grants of the late reign, and so lately settled and secured
by her Majesty's unparalleled grace and goodness. The
Queen was satisfied with their apology; but their refu∣sal
in all probability helped to alienate the Duke from the
Tories, with whom he had been hitherto connected.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In the beginning of January, the Queen gave
the House of Commons to understand, that the States-General
had pressed her to augment her forces, as the
only means to render ineffectual the great and early pre∣parations
of the enemy. The Commons immediately
resolved, That ten thousand men should be hired, as an
augmentation of the forces to act in conjunction with the
allies; but, on condition that an immediate stop should
be put to all commerce and correspondence with France
and Spain on the part of the States-General. The Lords
presented an address to the Queen on the same subject,
and to the same effect; and she owned that the condition
<PB N="442" REF="448"/>
was absolutely necessary for the good of the whole alliance.
The Dutch, even after the declaration of war, had carried
on a traffick with the French; and, at this very juncture,
Louis found it impossible to make remittances of money
to the Elector of Bavaria in Germany, and to his forces
in Italy, except through the canal of English, Dutch,
and Geneva merchants. The States-General, though
shocked at the imperious manner in which the parliament
of England prescribed their conduct, complied with the
demand without hesitation, and published a prohibition
of all commerce with the subjects of France and Spain.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The Commons of this parliament had no∣thing
more at heart than a bill against occasional confor∣mity.
The Tories affected to distinguish themselves as
the only true friends to the church and monarchy; and
they hated the dissenters with a mixture of spiritual and
political disgust. They looked upon these last as an in∣truding
sect, which constituted great part of the Whig
faction that extorted such immense sums of money from
the nation in the late reign, and involved it in pernicious
engagements, from whence it had no prospect of deliver∣ance.
They considered them as encroaching schismaticks
that disgraced and endangered the hierarchy; and those
of their own communion who recommended moderation,
they branded with the epithets of lukewarm christians,
betrayers, and apostates. They now resolved to approve
themselves zealous sons of the church, by seising the
first opportunity that was in their power to distress the
dissenters. In order to pave the way to this persecution,
sermons were preached, and pamphlets were printed to
blacken the character of the sect, and inflame the popular
resentment against them. On the fourth day of No∣vember,
Mr. Bromley, Mr. St. John, and Mr. An∣nesley,
were ordered by the House of Commons to
bring in a bill for preventing occasional conformity. In
the preamble all persecution for conscience sake was con∣demned:
nevertheless, it enacted, That all those who
had taken the sacrament and test for offices of trust, or the
<PB N="443" REF="449"/>
magistracy of corporations, and afterwards frequented any
meeting of dissenters, should be disabled from holding
their employments, pay a fine of one hundred pounds,
and five pounds for every day in which they continued to
act in their employments after having been at any such
meeting: they were also rendered incapable of holding
any other employment, till after one whole year's confor∣mity;
and, upon a relapse, the penalties and time of in∣capacity
were doubled. The promoters of the bill alledged,
that an established religion and national church were ab∣solutely
necessary, when so many impious men pretended
to inspiration, and deluded such numbers of the people:
that the most effectual way to preserve this national church,
would be the maintenance of the civil power in the hands
of those who expressed their regard to the church in their
principles and practice: that the parliament, by the cor∣poration
and test acts▪ thought they had raised a sufficient
barrier to the hierarchy, never imagining that a set of
men would rise up, whose consciences would be too ten∣der
to obey the laws, but hardened enough to break them:
that, as the last reign began with an act in favour of dis∣senters,
so the Commons were desirous that in the begin∣ning
of her Majesty's auspicious government, an act should
pass in favour of the church of England: that this bill did
not entrench on the act of toleration, or deprive the dis∣senters
of any privileges they enjoyed by law, or add any
thing to the legal rights of the church of England: that
occasional conformity was an evasion of the law, by which
the dissenters might insinuate themselves into the manage∣ment
of all corporations: that a separation from the church,
to which a man's conscience will allow him occasionally to
conform, is a mere schism, which in itself was sinful,
without the superaddition of a temporal law to make it an
offence: that the toleration was intended only for the ease
of tender consciences, and not to give a license for occa∣sional
conformity: that conforming and nonconforming
were contradictions; for, nothing but a firm persuasion
that the terms of communion required are sinful and un∣lawful
could justify the one; and this plainly condemns
<PB N="444" REF="450"/>
the other. The members who opposed the bill argued,
That the dissenters were generally well affected to the
present constitution: that to bring any real hardship up∣on
them, or give rise to jealousies and fears at such a junc∣ture,
might be attended with dangerous consequences:
that the toleration had greatly contributed to the security
and reputation of the church, and plainly proved, that li∣berty
of conscience and gentle measures were the most
effectual means for increasing the votaries of the church,
and diminishing the number of dissenters: that the dissen∣ters
could not be termed schismaticks without bringing an
heavy charge upon the church of England, which had
not only tolerated such schism, but even allowed commu∣nion
with the reformed churches abroad: that the penal∣ties
of this bill were more severe than those which the law
imposed on papists, for assisting at the most solemn act of
their religion: in a word, that toleration and tenderness
had been always productive of peace and union, whereas
persecution had never failed to excite discord, and extend
superstition. Many alterations and mitigations were pro∣posed,
without effect. In the course of the debates the dis∣senters
were mentioned and reviled with great acrimony;
and the bill passed the Lower House by virtue of a consi∣derable
majority.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The Lords, apprehensive that the Com∣mons
would tack it to some money-bill, voted, That the
annexing any clause to a money-bill was contrary to the
constitution of the English government, and the usage of
parliament. The bill met with a very warm opposition
in the Upper House, where a considerable portion of the
Whig interest still remained. These members believed that
the intention of the bill was to model corporations, so as
to eject all those who would not vote in elections for the
Tories. Some imagined this was a preparatory step to∣wards
a repeal of the toleration: and others concluded
that the promoters of the bill designed to raise such distur∣bances
at home, as would discourage the allies abroad, and
render the prosecution of the war impracticable. The
majority of the bishops, and among these Burnet of
<PB N="445" REF="451"/>
Sarum, objected against it on the principles of moder∣ation,
and from motives of conscience. Nevertheless, as
the court supported this measure with its whole power
and influence, the bill made its way through the House,
though not without alterations and amendments, which
were rejected by the Commons. The Lower House pre∣tended
that the Lords had no right to alter any fines and
penalties that the Commons should fix in bills sent up for
their concurrence, on the supposition, that those were
matters concerning money, the peculiar province of the
Lower House: the Lords ordered a minute enquiry to be
made into all the rolls of parliament since the reign of Henry
the Seventh; and a great number of instances were
found, in which the Lords had begun the clauses imposing
fines and penalties, altered the penalties which had been
fixed by the Commons, and even changed the uses to
which they were applied. These precedents were entered
in the books; but the Commons resolved to maintain
their point without engaging in any dispute upon the sub∣ject.
After warm debates, and a free conference between
the two Houses, the Lords adhered to their amendments,
though this resolution was carried by a majority of one
vote only: the Commons persisted in rejecting them;
the bill miscarried; and both Houses published their pro∣ceedings,
by way of appeal to the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this bill was depending▪ Daniel de Foe published a pamphlet, in∣tituled, “The shortest way with the dissenters: or, proposals for the establish∣ment of the church.” The piece was a severe satire on the violence of the church-party. The Commons ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, and the author to be prosecuted. He was accordingly com∣mitted to Newgate, tried, condomned to pay a fine of two hundred pounds, and stand in the pillory.</NOTE>. A bill was
now brought into the Lower House, granting another
year's consideration to those who had not taken the oath
abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales. The Lords
added three clauses, importing, That those persons who
should take the oath within the limited time might return
to their benefices and employments, unless they should
be already legally filled; that any person endeavouring to
defeat the succession to the crown, as now limited by law,
<PB N="446" REF="452"/>
should be deemed guilty of high-treason: and that the
oath of abjuration should be imposed upon the subjects in
Ireland. The Commons made some opposition to the first
clause; but, at length, the question being put, Whether
they should agree to the amendments? it was carried
in the affirmative by one voice.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. No object engrossed more time, or pro∣duced
more violent debates than did the enquiry into the
publick accounts. The commissioners appointed for this
purpose pretended to have made great discoveries. They
charged the Earl of Ranelagh, paymaster-general of the
army, with flagrant mismanagement. He acquitted him∣self
in such a manner as screened him from all severity of
punishment: nevertheless, they expelled him from the House
for a high crime and misdemeanour, in misapplying several
sums of the publick money; and he thought proper to
resign his employment. A long address was prepared and
presented to the Queen, attributing the national debt to
mismanagement of the funds; complaining that the old
methods of the Exchequer had been neglected; and that
iniquitous frauds had been committed by the commissioners
of the prizes. Previous to this remonstrance, the House,
in consequence of the report of the committee, had passed
several severe resolutions, particularly against Charles Lord
Hallifax, auditor of the receipt of the Exchequer, as
having neglected his duty, and been guilty of a breach of
trust. For these reasons, they actually besought the
Queen, in an address, that she would give directions to
the Attorney-general, to prosecute him for the said
offences; and she promised to comply with their request.
On the other hand, the Lords appointed a committee to
examine all the observations which the commissioners of
accounts had offered to both Houses. They ascribed the
national debt to desiciencies in the funds: they acquitted
Lord Hallifax, the lords of the Treasury, and their officers,
whom the Commons had accused; and represented these
circumstances in an address to the Queen, which was
afterwards printed with the vouchers to every particular.
<PB N="447" REF="453"/>
This difference blew up a fierce flame of discord between
the two Houses, which manifested their mutual animosity
in speeches, votes, resolutions, and conferences. The
Commons affirmed, That no cognizance the Lords could
take of the publick accounts would enable them to supply
any deficiency, or appropriate any surplusage of the publick
money: that they could neither acquit nor condemn any
person whatsoever, upon any enquiry arising originally in
their own House; and that their attempt to acquit
Charles Lord Hallifax was unparliamentary. The Lords
insisted upon their right to take cognizance originally of
all publick accounts; they affirmed, that in their resolutions
with respect to Lord Hallifax they had proceeded according
to the rules of justice. They owned, however, that their
resolutions did not amount to any judgement or acquittal;
but that finding a vote of the Commons reflected upon a
member of their House, they thought fit to give their opinion
in their legislative authority. The Queen interposed by a
message to the Lords, desiring they would dispatch the
business in which they were engaged. The dispute con∣tinued
even after this intimation: one conference was
held after another, till at length both sides despaired of
an accommodation. The Lords ordered their proceedings
to be printed, and the Commons followed their example.
On the twenty-seventh day of February the Queen having
passed all the bills that were ready for the royal assent,
ordered the Lord-Keeper to prorogue the parliament, after
having pronounced a speech, in the usual stile. She thanked
them for their zeal, affection, and dispatch; declared,
she would encourage and maintain the church as by law
established; desired they would consider some further laws
for restraining the great license assumed of publishing
scandalous pamphlets and libels; and assured them,
that all her share of the prizes which might be taken in
the war should be applied to the publick service. By this
time the Earl of Rochester was entirely removed from the
Queen's councils. Finding himself out-weighed by the
interest of the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin,
<PB N="448" REF="454"/>
he had become sullen and intractable; and rather than
repair to his government of Ireland, chose to resign the
office, which, as we have already observed, was conferred
upon the Duke of Ormond, an accomplished nobleman,
who had acquired great popularity by the success of the
expedition to Vigo. The parties in the House of Lords
were so nearly matched, that the Queen, in order to
ascertain an undoubted majority in the next session, created
four new peers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were John Granville created Baron Granville of otheridge, in the county of Devon: Heneage Finch, Baron of Guernsey, in the county of Southampton; Sir John Lev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son Gower, Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Gower, of Sittenham, in Yorkshire; and Francis Seymour Conway, youngest son of Sir Edward Seymour, made Baron Conway, of Ragley, in the county of Warwick. At the same time, however, John Hervey, of the opposite faction, was created Baron of Ickworth, in the county of Suffolk; and the Marquis of Nor∣manby was honoured with the title of Duke of Buckinghamshire.</NOTE>, who had signalized themselves by the
violence of their speeches in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The two Houses of convocation, which
were summoned with the parliament, bore a strong affinity
with this assembly by the different interests that prevailed
in the upper and lower. The last, in imitation of the
Commons, was desirous of branding the preceding reign;
and it was with great difficulty they concurred with
the prelates in an address of congratulation to her Majesty.
Then their former contest was revived. The Lower House
desired, in an application to the Archbishop of Canter∣bury
and his suffragans, that the matters in dispute con∣cerning
the manner of synodical proceedings, and the
right of the Lower House to hold intermediate assemblies,
might be taken into consideration, and speedily deter∣mined.
The bishops proposed, that in the intervals of
sessions, the Lower House might appoint committees to
prepare matters; and when business should be brought
regularly before them, the archbishop would regulate the
prorogations in such a manner, that they should have
sufficient time to sit and deliberate on the subject. This
offer did not satisfy the Lower House, which was embold∣ened
to persist in its demand by a vote of the Commons.
<PB N="449" REF="455"/>
These, in consequence of an address of thanks from the cler∣gy,
touching Mr. Lloyd, son to the Bishop of Worcester,
whom they ordered to be prosecuted after his privilege as
member of the convocation should be expired, had re∣solved,
That they would on all occasions assert the just
rights and privileges of the Lower House of convocation.
The prelates refused to depart from the archbishop's right
of proroguing the whole convocation with consent of his
suffragans. The Lower House proposed to refer the con∣troversy
to the Queen's decision. The bishops declined
this expedient, as inconsistent with the episcopal authority,
and the presidency of the archbishop. The Lower House
having incurred the imputation of favouring presbytery,
by this opposition to the bishops, entered in their books a
declaration, acknowledging the order of bishops as superior
to presbyters, and to be a divine apostolical institution.
Then they desired the bishops, in an address, to concur
in settling the doctrine of the divine apostolical right of epis∣copacy,
that it might be a standing rule of the church.
They likewise presented a petition to the Queen, com∣plaining,
That in the convocation called in the year 1700
after an interruption of ten years, several questions having
arisen concerning the rights and liberties of the Lower
House, the bishops had refused a verbal conference: and
afterwards declined a proposal to submit the dispute to
her Majesty's determination: they, therefore, fled for pro∣tection
to her Majesty, begging she would call the questi∣on
into her own royal audience. The Queen promised to
consider their petition, which was supported by the Earl
of Nottingham; and ordered their council to examine
the affair, how it consisted with law and custom. Whether
their report was unfavourable to the Lower House, or the
Queen was unwilling to encourage the division, no other
answer was made to their address. The archbishop repli∣ed
to their request presented to the Upper House, con∣cerning
the divine right of presbytery, that the preface to
the form of ordination contamed a declaration of three
orders of ministers from the times of the apostles; namely,
<PB N="450" REF="456"/>
bishops, priests, and deacons, to which they had subscrib∣ed:
but he and his brethren conceived, that, without a
royal licence, they had not authority to attempt, enact,
promulge, or execute any canon, which should concern
either doctrine or discipline. The Lower House answered
this declaration in very petulant terms; and the dispute
subsisted when the Parliament was prorogued. But these
contests produced divisions through the whole body of
the clergy, who ranged themselves in different factions,
distinguished by the names of High-church and Low-church.
The first consisted of ecclesiastical Tories: the
other included those who professed Revolution principles,
and recommended moderation towards the diffenters.
The High-church party reproached the other as time∣servers,
and presbyterians in disguise; and were in their
turn stigmatised as the friends and abettors of tyranny and
persecution. At present, however, the Tories both in
church and state triumphed in the favour of their sove∣reign.
The right of parliaments, the memory of the late
King, and even the act limiting the succession of the house
of Hanover, became the subjects of ridicule. The Queen
was flattered as possessor of the prerogatives of the ancient
monarchy: the history written by her grandfather the
Earl of Clarendon was now for the first time published,
to inculcate the principles of obedience, and inspire the
people with an abhorrence of opposition to an annointed
sovereign. Her Majesty's hereditary right was deduced
from Edward the Confessor, and, as heir of his pretend∣ed
sanctity and virtue, she was persuaded to touch per∣sons
afflicted with the King's evil, according to the office
inserted in the liturgy for this occasion.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The change of the ministry in Scotland seemed
favourable to the episcopalians and anti-revolutioners of
that kingdom. The Earls of Marchmont, Melvil, Selkirk,
Leven, and Hyndford were laid aside: the Earl of Sea∣field
was appointed chancellor: the Duke of Queensberry,
and the Lord Viscount Tarbat, were declared secretaries
of state: the Marquis of Annandale was made president of
<PB N="451" REF="457"/>
the council, and the Earl of Tullibardine, lord privy-seal. A
new parliament having been summoned, the Earl of Seafield
employed his influence so successfully, that a great number
of ant revolutioners was returned as members. The
Duke of Hamilton had obtained from the Queen a letter
to the privy-council in Scotland, in which she expressed
her desire, that the presbyterian clergy should live in bro∣therly
love and communion with such dissenting ministers
of the reformed religion as were in possession of benefices,
and lived with decency, and submission to the law. The
episcopal clergy, encouraged by these expressions in their
favour, drew up an address to the Queen, imploring her
protection; and humbly befeeching her to allow those
parishes in which there was a majority of episcopal free∣holders
to bestow the benefice on ministers of their prin∣ciples.
This petition was presented by Dr. Skeen and Dr.
Scot, who were introduced by the Duke of Queensberry
to her Majesty. She assured them of her protection and
endeavours to supply their necessities; and exhorted them
to live in peace and christian love with the clergy, who
were by law invested with the church government in her
ancient kingdom of Scotland. A proclamation of indemnity
having been published in March, a great number of Jaco∣bites
returned from France and other countries, pretend∣ed
to have changed their sentiments, and took the oaths,
that they might be qualified to sit in parliament. They
formed an accession to the strength of the anti-revoluti∣oners
and episcopalians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Torcy's Mem. Lamberty's Mem. Feuquieres. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urchet. Tindal. Lockhart's Mem. Lives of the Admirals. Hist. of the D. of Marl∣borough. Duchess of Marlbo∣rough's Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</NOTE> who now hoped to out-number the
presbyterians, and outweight their interest. But this confede∣racy
was composed of dissonant parts, from which no har∣mony
could be expected. The presbyterians and Revoluti∣oners
were headed by the Duke of Argyle. The country-party
of malcontents, which took its rise from the disap∣pointments
of the Darien settlement, acted under the auspic∣es
of the Duke of Hamilton and Marquis of Tweedale; and
the Earl of Hume appeared as chief of the anti-revolutioners.
The different parties who now united, pursued the most
opposite ends. The majority of the country-party were
<PB N="452" REF="458"/>
friends to the Revolution, and sought only redress of the
grievances which the nation had sustained in the late
reign. The anti-revolutioners considered the accession
and government of King William as an extraordinary
event, which they were willing to forget, believing that all
parties weresafe under the shelter of her Majesty's general
indemnity. The Jacobites submitted to the Queen, as tu∣trix
or regent for the Prince of Wales, whom they firmly
believed she intended to establish on the throne. The
Whigs under Argyle, alarmed at the coalition of all their
enemies, resolved to procure a parliamentary fanction for
the Revolution.</P>
<P>§ XXXI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1703.</NOTE> The parliament being opened on the sixth
day of May at Edinburgh, by the Duke of Queensberry
as commissioner, the Queen's letter was read, in which
she demanded a supply for the maintenance of the forces,
advised them to encourage trade, and exhorted them to
proceed with wisdom, prudence, and unanimity. The
Duke of Hamilton immediately offered the draft of a bill
for recognizing her Majesty's undoubted right and title to
the Imperial crown of Scotland, according to the declara∣tion
of the estates of the kingdom, containing the claim of
right. It was immediately received; and at the second read∣ing,
the Queen's advocate offered an additional clause, de∣nouncing
the penalties of treason against any person who
should quarrel her Majesty's right and title to the crown,
or her exercise of the government, from her actual entry to
the same. This, after a long and warm debate, was car∣ried
by the concurrence of the anti-revolutioners. Then
the Earl of Hume produced the draft of a bill for the sup∣ply:
immediately after it was read, the Marquis of Twee∣dale
made an overture, that before all other business, the
parliament would proceed to make such conditions of go∣vernment,
and regulations in the constitution of the king∣dom,
to take place after the decease of her Majesty and
the heirs of her body, as should be necessary for the pre∣servation
of their religion and liberty. This overture and
the bill were ordered to lie upon the table; and, in the
<PB N="453" REF="459"/>
mean time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1703.</NOTE> the commissioner found himself involved in
great perplexity. The Duke of Argyle, the Marquis of
Annandale, and the Earl of Marchmont, gave him to
understand in private, that they were resolved to move for
an act, ratifying the Revolution; and for another, con∣firming
the presbyterian government: that they would
insist upon their being discussed before the bill of supply,
and that they were certain of carrying the points at which
they aimed. The commissioner now found himself re∣duced
to a very disagreeable alternative. There was a
necessity for relinquishing all hope of a supply, or aban∣doning
the anti-revolutioners, to whom he was connected
by promises of concurrence. The Whigs were determined
to oppose all schemes of supply that should come from the
cavaliers: and these last resolved to exert their whole power
in preventing the confirmation of the Revolution and the
presbyterian discipline. He foresaw that on this occasion
the Whigs would be joined by the Duke of Hamilton and
his party, so as to preponderate against the cavaliers. He
endeavoured to cajole both parties; but found the task
impracticable. He desired in parliament, that the act for
the supply might be read, promising that they should
have full time afterwards to deliberate on other subjects.
The Marquis of Tweedale insisted upon his overture;
and, after warm debates, the House resolved to proceed with
such acts as might be necessary for securing the religion,
liberty, and trade of the nation, before any bill for supply
or other business should be discussed. The Marquis of
Athol offered an act for the security of the kingdom, in
case of her Majesty's decease: but, before it was read, the
Duke of Argyle presented his draft of a bill for ratifying
the Revolution, and all the acts following thereupon. An
act for limiting the succession after the death of her Ma∣jesty,
and the heirs of her body, was produced by Mr.
Fletcher, of Saltoun. The Earl of Rothes recommended
another, importing, that after her Majesty's death, and
failing heirs of her body, no person coming to the crown
of Scotland, being at the same time King or Queen of Eng∣land,
<PB N="454" REF="460"/>
should,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1703.</NOTE> as King or Queen of Scotland, have power
to make peace or war without the consent of parliament.
The Earl of Marchmont recited the draft of an act for
securing the true protestant religion and presbyterian
government: one was also suggested by Sir Patrick John∣ston,
allowing the importation of wines, and other foreign
liquors. All these bills were ordered to lie upon the table.
Then the Earl of Strath more produced an act for toleration
to all protestants in the exercise of religious worship. But
against this the general assembly presented a most violent
remonstrance; and the promoters of the bill foreseeing that
it would meet with great opposition, allowed it to drop for
the present. On the third day of June, the parliament
passed the act for preserving the true reformed protestant
religion, and confirming presbyterian church government,
as agreeable to the word of God, and the only government
of Christ's church within the kingdom. The same party
enjoyed a further triumph in the success of Argyle's act,
for ratifying and perpetuating the first act of King Wil∣liam's
parliament; for declaring it high treason to disown
the authority of that parliament; or to alter or innovate
the claim of right, or any article thereof. This last clause
was strenuously opposed; but at last the bill passed, with
the concurrence of all the ministry, except the Marquis
of Athol and the Viscount Tarbat, who began at this pe∣riod
to correspond with the opposite party.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The cavaliers thinking themselves betrayed
by the Duke of Queensberry, who had assented to these
acts, first expostulated with him on his breach of promise,
and then renounced his interest, resolving to separate
themselves from the court, and jointly pursue such mea∣sures
as might be for the interest of their party. But of
all the bills that were produced in the course of this remark∣able
session, that which produced the most violent alter∣cation
was the act of security, calculated to abridge the
prerogative of the crown, limit the successor, and throw
a vast additional power into the hands of the parliament.
It was considered paragraph by paragraph: many additions
<PB N="455" REF="461"/>
and alterations were proposed, and some adopted: inflam∣matory
speeches were uttered; bitter sarcasms retorted from
party to party; and different votes passed on different
clauses. At length, in spite of the most obstinate oppo∣sition
from the ministry and the cavaliers, it was passed by
a majority of fifty-nine voices. The commissioner was
importuned to give it the royal assent; but declined an∣swering
their entreaties till the tenth day of September.
Then he made a speech in parliament, giving them to
understand that he had received the Queen's pleasure, and
was empowered to give the royal assent to all the acts
voted in this session, except to the act for the security of
the kingdom. A motion was made, to sollicit the royal
assent in an address to her Majesty; but the question being
put, it was carried in the negative by a small majority.
On the sixth day of the same month, the Earl of March∣mont
had produced a bill to settle the succession on the
House of Hanover. At first the import of it was not
known; but, when the clerk in reading it mentioned the
Princess Sophia, the whole House was kindled into a flame.
Some proposed that the overture should be burned: others
moved that the Earl might be sent prisoner to the castle;
and a general dissatisfaction appeared in the whole assem∣bly.
Not that the majority in parliament were averse to
the succession in the house of Hanover: but they resolved
to avoid a nomination without stipulating conditions; and
they had already provided, in the act of security, that it
should be high-treason to own any person as King or
Queen after her Majesty's decease, until he or she should
take the coronation oath, and accept the terms of the
claim of right, and such conditions as should be settled in
this or any ensuing parliament.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, a man of un∣daunted
courage and inflexible integrity, who professed
republican principles, and seemed designed by nature as a
member of some Grecian commonwealth, after having
observed that the nation would be enslaved, should it sub∣mit,
either willingly or by commission, to the successor
<PB N="456" REF="462"/>
of England, without such conditions of government as
should secure them against the influence of an English
ministry, offered the draft of an act, importing, That
after the decease of her Majesty, without heirs of her
body, no person being successor to the English throne
should succeed to the crown of Scotland, but under the
following limitations, which, together with the corona∣tion-oath
and claim of right, they should swear to observe:
namely, That all offices and places, civil and military, as
well as pensions, should for the future be conferred by a par∣liament
to be chosen at every Michaelmas head-court, to
sit on the first day of November, and adjourn themselves
from time to time, till the ensuing Michaelmas: That
they should choose their own president: That a com∣mittee
of six-and-thirty members, chosen out of the
whole parliament, without distinction of estates, should,
during the intervals of parliament, be vested, under the
King, with the administration of the government, act as
his council, be accountable to parliament, and call it
together on extraordinary occasions. He proposed that
the successor should be nominated by the majority; decla∣ring
for himself, that he would rather concur in nomina∣ting
the most rigid papist with those conditions, than the
truest protestant without them. The motion was second∣ed
by many members; and though postponed for the pre∣sent,
in favour of an act of trade under the consideration
of the House, it was afterwards resumed with great
warmth. In vain the Lord-Treasurer represented that no
funds were as yet provided for the army, and moved for a
reading of the act presented for that purpose: a certain
member observed, that this was a very unseasonable junc∣ture
to propose a supply, when the House had so much to
do for the security of the nation: he said they had very
little encouragement to grant supplies, when they found
themselves frustrated of all their labour and expense for
these several months; and when the whole kingdom saw
that supplies served for no other uses but to gratify the
avarice of some insatiable ministers. Mr. Fletcher ex∣patiated
upon the good consequences that would arise from
<PB N="457" REF="463"/>
the act which he had proposed. The Chancellor an∣swered,
That such an act was laying a scheme for a com∣monwealth,
and tending to innovate the constitution of
the monarchy. The ministry proposed the state of a vote,
whether they should first give a reading to Fletcher's act,
or to the act of subsidy. The country-party moved that
the question might be, “Overtures for subsidies, or over∣tures
for liberty.” Fletcher withdrew his act, rather
than people should pervert the meaning of laudable de∣signs.
The House resounded with the cry of “Liberty
or subsidy.” Bitter invectives were uttered against the
ministry. One member said it was now plain the nation
was to expect no other return for their expense and toil,
than that of being loaded with a subsidy, and being obliged
to bend their necks under the yoke of slavery, which was
prepared for them from that throne: another observed,
that as their liberties were suppressed, so the privileges of
parliament were like to be torn from them; but that he
would venture his life in defence of his birthright, and
rather die a free man than live a slave. When the vote
was demanded, and declined by the Commissioner, the
Earl of Roxburgh declared, that if there was no other way
of obtaining so natural and undeniable a privilege of par∣liament,
they would demand it with their swords in their
hands. The Commissioner, foreseeing this spirit of free∣dom
and contradiction, had ordered the foot-guards to be
in readiness, and placed a strong guard upon the eastern
gate of the city. Notwithstanding these precautions, he
ran the risque of being torn in pieces; and, in this ap∣prehension,
ordered the Chancellor to inform the House,
that the parliament should proceed upon overtures for
liberty at their next sitting. This promise allayed the
ferment which had begun to rise. Next day the members
prepared an overture, implying, That the elective mem∣bers
should be chosen for every seat at the Michaelmas
head-courts: That a parliament should be held once in
two years at least: That the short adjournments <HI>de die in
diem</HI> should be made by the parliaments themselves, as in
<PB N="458" REF="464"/>
England; and That no officer in the army, Customs, or
Excise, nor any gratuitous pensioner, should sit as an
elective member. The Commissioner being apprised of
their proceedings, called for such acts as he was empowered
to pass, and having given the royal assent to them, proro∣gued
the parliament to the twelfth day of October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the Queen refused to pass the act of security, the royal assent was granted to an act of limitation on the successor, in which it was declared that no King or Queen of Scotland should have power to make war or peace without consent of parliament. Another law was enacted, allowing French wines and other liquors to be imported in neutral bottoms; Without this ex∣pedient, it was alledged that the revenue would have been insufficient to maintain the government. An act passed in favour of the company trading to Africa and the Indies; another for a commission concerning the publick a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ounts; a third for punishing slanderous speeches and writings. The com∣mission for treating of an union with England was vacated, with a prohibition to grant any other commission for that purpose without consent of parlia∣ment; and no supply having been provided before the adjournment, the army and expense of government were maintained upon credit.</NOTE>.
Such was the issue of this remarkable session of the Scot∣tish
parliament, in which the Duke of Queensberry was
abandoned by the greatest part of the ministry; and such
a spirit of ferocity and opposition pevailed, as threatened
the whole kingdom with civil war and confusion. The
Queen conferred titles upon those<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Marquis of Athol, and the Marquis of Douglas, though this la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was a mino<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, were created dukes: Lord Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat was invested with the title of Earl of Cromarty: the Viscount Stai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Roseberry were promoted to the same dignity.

influence in the nation, and attachment to her govern∣ment,
and revived the order of the Thistle, which the
late king had dropped.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. Ireland was filled with discontent, by the
behaviour and conduct of the trustees for the forfeited
estates. The Earl of Rochester had contributed to foment
the troubles of the kingdom, by encouraging the factions
which had been imported from England. The Duke of
Ormond was received with open arms, as heir to the
<PB N="459" REF="465"/>
virtues of his ancestors, who had been the bulwarks of the
protestant interests in Ireland. He opened the parliament
on the twenty-first day of September, with a speech to both
Houses, in which he told them, that his inclination, his
interest, and the examples of his progenitors, were indis∣pensible
obligations upon him, to improve every opportu∣nity
to the advantage and prosperity of his native country.
The Commons having chosen Allen Broderick to be their
speaker, proceeded to drawup very affectionate addresses to
the Queen and the Lord-lieutenant. In that to the
Queen they complained, that their enemies had misrepre∣sented
them, as desirous of being independent of the crown
of England: they, therefore, to vindicate themselves from
such false aspersions, declared and acknowledged, that the
kingdom of Ireland was annexed and united to the imperial
crown of England. In order to express their hatred of
the trustees, they resolved, That all the protestant free∣holders
of that kingdom had been fassly and maliciously
misrepresented, traduced, and abused, in a book intituled,
“The Report of the commissioners appointed to enquire
into the Irish forfeitures;” and it appearing that Francis
Annesley, member of the House, John Trenchard, Henry
Langford, and James Hamilton, were authors of that
book, they further resolved, That these persons had scanda∣lously
and maliciously misrepresented and traduced the
protestant freeholders of that kingdom, and endeavoured
to create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the
people of England and the protestants of Ireland. Annesley
was expelled the House, Hamilton was dead, and Trenchard
had returned to England. They had finished the enquiry
before the meeting of this parliament; and sold, at an under
value, the best of the forfeited estates to the sword-blade
company of England. This, in a petition to the Irish
parliament, prayed that heads of a bill be brought in for
enabling them to take conveyances of lands in Ireland:
but the parliament was very little disposed to confirm the
bargains of the trustees, and the petition lay neglected on
the table. The House expelled John Asgill, who, as
<PB N="460" REF="466"/>
agent to the sword-blade company, had offered to lend
money to the publick in Ireland, on condition that the
parliament would pass an act to confirm the company's
purchase of the forfeited estates. His constituents disowned
his proposal; and when he was summoned to appear
before the House, and answer for his prevarication, he
pleaded his privilege, as member of the English parliament.
The Commons, in a representation of the state and
grievances of the nation, gave her Majesty to understand,
that the constitution of Ireland had been of late greatly
shaken; and their lives, liberties, and estates called in
question, and tried in a manner unknown to their ancestors;
that the expense to which they had been unnecessarily ex∣posed
by the late trustees for the forfeited estates, in de∣fending
their just rights and titles, had exceeded in value
the current cash of the kingdom: that their trade was de∣cayed,
their money exhausted; and that they were hin∣dered
from maintaining their own manufactures: that
many protestant families had been constrained to quit the
kingdom, in order to earn a livelihood in foreign countries:
that the want of frequent parliaments in Ireland had encou∣raged
evil-minded men to oppress the subject: that many
civil officers had acquired great fortunes in that impoverish∣ed
country, by the exercise of corruption and oppression:
that others, in considerable employments, resided in ano∣ther
kingdom, neglecting personal attendance on their duty,
while their offices were ill executed, to the detriment of
the publick, and the failure of justice. They declared,
that it was from her Majesty's gracious interposition alone
they proposed to themselves relief from those their mani∣fold
groans and misfortunes. The Commons afterwards
voted the necessary supplies, and granted one hundred
and fifty thousand pounds to make good the deficiencies
of the necessary branches of the establishment.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. They appointed a committee to inspect the
publick accounts, by which they discovered, that above
one hundred thousand pounds had been falsly charged as
a debt upon the nation. The committee was thanked by the
<PB N="461" REF="467"/>
House for having saved this sum, and ordered to examine
what persons were concerned in such a misrepresentation,
which was generally imputed to those who acted under the
Duke of Ormond. He himself was a nobleman of honour
and generosity, addicted to pleasure, and fond of popular
applause: but he was surrounded by people of more sordid
principles, who had ingratiated themselves into his confi∣dence
by the arts of adulation. The Commons voted a
provision for the half-pay officers; and abolished pensions
to the amount of seventeen thousand pounds a year, as
unnecessary branches of the establishment. They passed
an act settling the succession of the crown, after the pattern
set them by England: but the most important transaction
of this session was a severe bill to prevent the growth of
popery. It bore a strong affinity to that which had passed
three years before in England; but contained more effectual
clauses. Among others, it enacted, That all estates of
papists should be equally divided among the children, not∣withstanding
any settlement to the contrary, unless the
persons to whom they might be settled should qualify
themselves by taking the oaths, and communicating with
the church of England. The bill was not at all agreeable to
the ministry in England, who expected large presents from
the papists, by whom a considerable sum had been actually
raised for this purpose. But, as they did not think proper
to reject such a bill while the English parliament was sit∣ting,
they added a clause which they hoped the parliament of
Ireland would refuse; namely, that no persons in that
kingdom should be capable of any employment, or of
being in the magistracy of any city, who did not qualify
themselves by receiving the sacrament, according to the
test-act passed in England. Though this was certainly
a great hardship on the dissenters, the parliament of
Ireland sacrificed this consideration to their common
security against the Roman catholicks, and accepted
the amendment without hesitation. This affair being
discussed, the Commons of Ireland passed a vote against
a book intituled, “Memoirs of the late King James II.”
<PB N="462" REF="468"/>
as a seditious libel. They ordered it to be burned by the
hands of the common hangman; and the bookseller and
printer to be prosecuted. When this motion was made,
a member informed the House, that in the county of
Limerick, the Irish papists had begun to form themselves
into bodies; to plunder the protestants of their arms and
money; and to maintain a correspondence with the dis∣affected
in England. The House immediately resolved,
That the papists of the kingdom still retained hopes of
the accession of the person known by the name of the
Prince of Wales in the life-time of the late King James,
and now by the name of James III. In the midst of this
zeal against popery and the Pretender, they were sudden∣ly
adjourned by the command of the Lord-lieutenant,
and broke up in great animosity against that nobleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They had, besides the bills already mentioned, passed an act for an addi∣tional Excise on beer, ale, and other liquors: another encouraging the im∣portation of iron and slaves: a third for preventing popish priests from com∣ing into the kingdom: a fourth securing the liberty of the subject, and for prevention of imprisonment beyond seas; and a fifth for naturalizing all pro∣testant strangers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The attention of the English ministry had
been for some time chiefly engrossed by the affairs of the
continent. The Emperor agreed with the allies, that
his son the Archduke Charles should assume the title of
King of Spain, demand the Infanta of Portugal in mar∣riage,
and undertake something of importance, with the
assistance of the maritime powers. Mr. Methuen, the
English minister at Lisbon, had already made some progress
in a treaty with his Portuguese Majesty; and the court of
Vienna promised to send such an army into the field as
would in a little time drive the Elector of Bavaria from
his dominions. But they were so dilatory in their pre∣parations,
that the French King broke all their mea∣sures,
by sending powerful re-enforcements to the Elector,
in whose ability and attachment Louis reposed great
confidence. Mareschal Villars, who commanded an army
of thirty thousand men at Strasburg, passed the Rhine,
and reduced fort K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hl, the garrison of which was con∣ducted
<PB N="463" REF="469"/>
to Philipsburgh. The Emperor, alarmed at this
event, ordered Count Schlick to enter Bavaria on the
side of Saltsburg, with a considerable body of forces;
and sent another under Count Stirum, to invade the same
electorate by the way of Newmark, which was surren∣dered
to him, after he had routed a party of Bavarians:
the city of Amberg met with the same fate. Mean while
Count Schlick defeated a body of militia that defended
the lines of Saltsburg, and made himself master of Riedt,
and several other places. The Elector assembling his
forces near Brenau, diffused a report that he intended to
besiege Passau, to cover which place Schlick advanced
with the greatest part of his infantry, leaving behind his
cavalry and cannon. The Elector having by this feint
divided the Imperialists, passed the bridge of Scardingen
with twelve thousand men, and, after an obstinate en∣gagement,
compelled the Imperialists to abandon the field
of battle: then he marched against the Saxon troops
which guarded the artillery, and attacked them with such
impetuosity, that they were entirely defeated. In a few
days after these actions, he took Newburg on the Inn by
capitulation. He obtained another advantage over an ad∣vanced
post of the Imperialists near Burgenfeldt, com∣manded
by the young Prince of Brandenburg Anspach,
who was mortally wounded in the engagement. He ad∣vanced
to Ratisbon, where the diet of the empire was
assembled, and demanded that he should be immediately
put in possession of the bridge and gate of the city. The
burghers immediately took to their arms, and planted
cannon on the ramparts: but when they saw a battery
erected against them, and the Elector determined to bom∣bard
the place, they thought proper to capitulate, and
comply with his demands He took possession of the
town on the eighth day of April, and signed an instrument
obliging himself to withdraw his troops, as soon as the
Emperor should ratify the diet's resolution for the neutra∣lity
of Ratisbon. Mareschal Villars having received
orders to join the Elector at all events, and being re-en∣forced
<PB N="464" REF="470"/>
by a body of troops under Count Tallard, resolved
to break through the lines which the Prince of Baden
had made at Stolhoffen. This general had been luckily
joined by eight Dutch battalions, and received the French
army, though double his number, with such obstinate reso∣lution,
that Villars was obliged to retreat with great loss,
and directed his route towards Offingen. Nevertheless,
he penetrated through the Black Forest, and effected a
junction with the Elector. Count Stirum endeavoured
to join Prince Louis of Baden: but being attacked near
Schwemmingen, retired under the cannon of Nortlingen.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The confederates were more sucessful on
the Lower Rhine and in the Netherlands. The Duke of
Marlborough crossed the sea in the beginning of April,
and assembling the allied army, resolved that the cam∣paign
should be begun with the siege of Bonne, which
was accordingly invested on the twenty-fourth day of
April. Three different attacks were carried on against
this place; one by the Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Cassel;
another by the celebrated Coehorn; and a third by
Lieutenant-General Fagel. The garrison defended them∣selves
vigorously till the fourteenth day of May, when
the fort having been taken by assault, and the breaches
rendered practicable, the Marquis d'Alegre, the gover∣nor,
ordered a parley to be beat: hostages were immedi∣ately
exchanged: on the sixteenth the capitulation was
signed; and in three days the garrison evacuated the place,
in order to be conducted to Luxemburg. During the
siege of Bonne, the Mareschals Boufflers and Villeroy ad∣vanced
with an army of forty thousand men towards
Tongeren, and the confederate army commanded by
M. D'Auverquerque was obliged at their approach to retreat
under the cannon of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strich. The enemy having
taken possession of Tongeren, made a motion against the
confederate army, which they found already drawn up in
order of battle, and so advantageously posted, that not∣withstanding
their great superiority in point of number,
they would not hazard an attack; but retired to the ground
<PB N="465" REF="471"/>
from whence they had advanced. Immediately after the
reduction of Bonne, the Duke of Marlborough, who had
been present at the siege, returned to the confederate army
in the Netherlands, now amounting to one hundred and
thirty squadrons, and fifty-nine battalions. On the twen∣ty-fifth
day of May; the Duke having passed the river
Jecker, in order to give battle to the enemy, they marched
with precipitation to Boekwern, and abandoned Tonge∣ren,
after having blown up the walls of the place with
gunpowder. The Duke continued to follow them to
Thys, where he encamped, while they retreated to Han∣nye,
retiring as he advanced. Then he resolved to force
their lines: this service was effectually performed by
Coehorn, at the point of Callo, and by Baron Spaar, in
the county of Waes, near Stoken. The Duke had formed
the design of reducing Antwerp, which was garrisoned
by Spanish troops, under the command of the Marquis
de Bedmar. He intended with the grand army to attack
the enemy's lines on the side of Louvaine and Mechlin:
he detached Coehorn with his flying camp on the right
of the Scheldt, towards Dutch Flanders, to amuse the
Marquis de Bedmar on that side; and he ordered the
Baron Opdam, with twelve thousand men, to take post
between Eckeren and Capelle, near Antwerp, that he
might act against that part of the lines which was guard∣ed
by the Spanish forces.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The French generals, in order to frus∣trate
the scheme of Marlborough, resolved to cut off the
retreat of Opdam. Boufflers, with a detachment of twenty
thousand men from Villeroy's army, surprised him at
Eckeren, where the Dutch were put in disorder; and
Opdam, believing all was lost, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led to Breda. Neverthe∣less,
the troops rallying under General Schlangenburg,
maintained their ground with the most obstinate valour,
till night, when the enemy was obliged to retire, and left
the communication free with fort Lillo, to which place
the confederates marched without further molestation, ha∣ving
lost about fifteen hundred men in the engagement. The
<PB N="466" REF="472"/>
damage sustained by the French was more considerable.
They were frustrated in their design, and had actually
abandoned the field of battle: yet Louis ordered <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Deum</HI>
to be sung for the victory: nevertheless, Boufflers was
censured for his conduct on this occasion, and in a little
time totally disgraced. Opdam presented a justification
of his conduct to the States-General: but by this over∣sight
he forfeited the fruits of a long service, during which
he had exhibited repeated proofs of courage, zeal, and
capacity. The States honoured Schlangenburg with a
letter of thanks for the valour and skill he had manifested
in this engagement: but, in a little time, they dismissed him
from his employment, on account of his having given
umbrage to the Duke of Marlborough, by censuring his
grace for exposing such a small number of men to this
disaster. After this action, Villeroy, who lay encamped
near St. Job, declared he would wait for the Duke of
Marlborough, who forthwith advanced to Hoogstraat,
with a view to give him battle: but, at his approach, the
French general, setting fire to his camp, retired within his
lines with great precipitation. Then the Duke invested
Huy, the garrison of which, after a vigorous defence, sur∣rendered
themselves prisoners of war, on the twenty-seventh
day of August. At a council of war held in the
camp of the confederates, the Duke proposed to attack
the enemy's lines between the Mehaigne and Leuwe, and
was seconded by the Danish, Hanoverian, and Hessian
generals: but the scheme was opposed by the Dutch
officers, and the deputies of the States, who alledged, that
the success was dubious, and the consequences of forcing
the lines would be inconsiderable: they, therefore, recom∣mended
the siege of Limburg, by the reduction of which
they would acquire a whole province, and cover their own
country, as well as Juliers and Gueldres, from the designs
of the enemy. The siege of Limburg was accordingly
undertaken. The trenches were opened on the five-and-twentieth
day of September, and in two days the place was
surrendered; the garrison remaining prisoners of war. By
<PB N="467" REF="473"/>
this conquest the allies secured the country of Liege, and
the electorate of Cologn, from the incursions of the ene∣my:
before the end of the year, they remained masters of
the whole Spanish Guelderland, by the reduction of
Gueldres, which surrendered on the seventeenth day of
September, after having been long blockaded, bombarded,
and reduced to a heap of ashes, by the Prussian general,
Lottum. Such was the campaign in the Netherlands,
which in all probability would have produced events of
greater importance, had not the Duke of Marlborough
been restricted by the deputies of the States-General,
who began to be influenced by the intrigues of the Lou∣veste
in faction, ever averse to a single dictator.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The French King redoubled his efforts in
Germany. The Duke de Vendome was ordered to march
from the Milanese to Tyrol, and there join the Elector of
Bavaria, who had already made himself master of In∣spruck.
But the boors rising in arms, drove him out of
the country before he could be joined by the French gene∣ral,
who was, therefore, obliged to return to the Milanese.
The Imperialists in Italy were so ill supplied by the court
of Vienna, that they could not pretend to act offensively.
The French invested Ostiglia, which, however, they
could not reduce: but the sortress of Barsillo, in the
duchy of Reggio, capitulating after a long blockade, they
took possession of the Duke of Modena's country. The
Elector of Bavaria rejoining Villars, resolved to attack
Count Stirum, whom Prince Louis of Baden had detached
from his army. With this view, they passed the Danube
at Donawert, and discharged six guns, as a signal for the
Marquis D'Usson, whom they had lest in the camp at
Lavingen, to sall upon the rear of the Imperialists, while
they should charge them in front Stirum no sooner per∣ceived
the signal, than he guessed the intention of the
enemy, and instantly resolved to attack D'Usson before the
Elector and the mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schal should advance. He, accord∣ingly,
charged him at the head of some select squadrons,
with such impetuosity, that the French cavalry were
<PB N="468" REF="474"/>
totally defeated; and all his infantry would have been
killed and taken, had not the Elector and Villars come up
in time to turn the fate of the day. The action continued
from six in the morning till four in the afternoon, when
Stirum being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat
to Norlingen, with the loss of twelve thousand men, and
all his baggage and artillery. In the mean time, the Duke
of Burgundy, assisted by Tallard, undertook the siege of
Old Brisac, with a prodigious train of artillery. The place
was very strongly fortified, though the garrison was small,
and ill provided with necessaries. In fourteen days, the
governor surrendered the place, and was condemned to
lose his head, for having made such a slender defence. The
Duke of Burgundy returned in triumph to Versailles, and
Tallard was ordered to invest Landau. The Prince of
Hesse-Cassel being detached from the Netherlands, for
the relief of the place, joined the Count of Nassau-Weil∣bourg,
general of the Palatine forces, near Spires, where
they resolved to attack the French in their lines. But by
this time Mons. Pracontal, with ten thousand men, had
joined Tallard, and enabled him to strike a stroke which
proved deceisive. He suddenly quitted his lines, and sur∣prised
the Prince at Spirebach, where the French obtained
a complete victory, after a very obstinate and bloody en∣gagement,
in which the Prince of Hesse distinguished him∣self
by uncommon marks of courage and presence of mind.
Three horses were successively killed under him, and he
flew a French officer with his own hand. After incredible
efforts, he was fain to retreat with the loss of some thou∣sands.
The French paid dear for their victory, Pracon∣tal
having been slain in the action. Nevertheless, they re∣sumed
the siege, and the place was surrendered by capi∣tulation.
The campaign in Germany was finished with
the reduction of Augsburg by the Elector of Bavaria, who
took it in the month of December, and agreed to its being
secured by a French garrison.</P>
<P>§ XL. The Emperor's affairs at this juncture wore a
very unpromising aspect. The Hungarians were fleeced,
<PB N="469" REF="475"/>
and barbarously oppressed, by those to whom he entrusted
the government of their country. They derived courage
from despair. They seised this opportunity, when the
Emperor's forces were divided, and his councils di∣stracted,
to exert themselves in defence of their liberties.
They ran to arms, under the auspices of Prince Ragotzki.
They demanded that their grievances should be redressed,
and their privileges restored. Their resentment was kept
up by the emissaries of France and Bavaria, who likewise
encouraged them to persevere in their revolt, by repeated
promises of protection and assistance. The Emperor's
prospect, however, was soon mended, by two incidents
of very great consequence to his interest. The Duke of
Savoy, foreseeing how much he should lie exposed to the
mercy of the French King, should that monarch become
master of the Milanese, engaged in a secret negociation
with the Emperor, which, notwithstanding all his caution,
was discovered by the court of Versailles. Louis immedi∣ately
ordered the Duke de Vendome to disarm the troops
of Savoy that were in his army, to the number of two-and-twenty
thousand men: to insist upon the Duke's
putting him in possession of four considerable fortresses;
and demand that the number of his troops should be re∣duced
to the establishment stipulated in the treaty of 1696.
The Duke, exasperated at these insults, ordered the
French ambassador, and several officers of the same na∣tion,
to be arrested. Louis endeavoured to intimidate
him by a menacing letter, in which he gave him to under∣stand,
that since neither religion, honour, interest, nor
alliances, had been able to influence his conduct, the
Duke de Vendome should make known the intentions of
the French monarch, and allow him four-and-twenty
hours to deliberate on the measures he should pursue.
This letter was answered by a manifesto: in the mean
time, the Duke concluded a treaty with the court of
Vienna; acknowledged the Archduke Charles as King
of Spain; and sent envoys to England and Holland.
<PB N="470" REF="476"/>
Queen Anne, knowing his importance, as well as his
selfish disposition, assured him of her friendship and
assistance; and both she and the States sent ambassadors
to Turin. He was immediately joined by a body of Im∣perial
horse under Visconti, and afterwards by Count
Staremberg, at the head of fifteen thousand men, with
whom that general marched from the Modenese, in the
worst season of the year, through an enemy's country,
and roads that were deemed impassable. In vain the
French forces harrassed him in his march, and even sur∣rounded
him in many different places on the route: he
surmounted all these difficulties with incredible courage
and perseverance, and joined the Duke of Savoy at Ca∣nelli,
so as to secure the country of Piedmont. The other
incident which proved so favourable to the Imperial inte∣rest,
was a treaty by which the King of Portugal acceded
to the grand alliance. His ministry perceived, that should
Spain be once united to the crown of France, their master
would sit very insecure upon his throne. They were in∣timidated
by the united fleets of the maritime powers,
which maintained the empire of the sea; and they were
allured by the splendour of a match between their infanta
and the Archduke Charles, to whom the Emperor and
the King of the Romans promised to transfer all their
pretensions to the Spanish crown. By this treaty, con∣cluded
at Lisbon, between the Emperor, the Queen of
Great-Britain, the King of Portugal, and the States-General,
it was stipulated, That King Charles should
be conveyed to Portugal by a powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet, having
on board twelve thousand soldiers, with a great supply
of money, arms, and ammunition; and that he should be
joined immediately upon his landing by an army of eight-and-twenty
thousand Portuguese.</P>
<P>§ XLI. The confederates reaped very little advantage
from the naval operations of this summer. Sir George
Rooke cruised in the channel, in order to alarm the coast
of France, and protect the trade of England. On the
<PB N="471" REF="477"/>
first day of July, Sir Cloudesley Shovel sailed from St.
Helen's, with the combined squadrons of England and
Holland: he directed his course to the Mediterranean,
and being reduced to great difficulty by want of water,
steered to Altea, on the coast of Valentia, where Briga∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
Seymour landed, and encamped with five and-twenty
hundred marines. The Admiral published a short mani∣festo,
signifying that he was not come to disturb, but to
protect, the good subjects of Spain, who should swear al∣legiance
to their lawful monarch, the Archduke Charles,
and endeavour to shake off the yoke of France. This
declaration produced little or no effect; and the fleet being
watered, Sir Cloudesley sailed to Leghorn. One design of
this armament was to assist the Cevennois, who had in the
course of the preceding year been persecuted into a revolton
account of religion, and implored the assistance of England
and the States-General. The Admiral detached two ships
into the gulf of Narbonne, with some refugees and French
pilots, who had concerted signals with the Cevennois:
but the Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schal de Montrevil having received intimation
of their design, took such measures as prevented all com∣munication;
and the English captains having repeated
their signals to no purpose, rejoined Sir Cloudesley at
Leghorn. This admiral, having renewed the peace with
the piratical states of Barbary, returned to England with∣out
having taken one effectual step for annoying the ene∣my,
or attempted any thing that looked like the result of
a concerted scheme for that purpose. The nation naturally
murmured at the fruitless expedition, by which it had in∣curred
such a considerable expense. The merchants com∣plained
that they were ill supplied with convoys. The
ships of war were victualled with damaged provision; and
every article of the marine being mismanaged, the blame
fell upon those who acted as council to the lord high-admiral.</P>
<P>§ XLII. Nor were the arms of England by sea much
more successful in the West-Indies. Sir George Rooke,
<PB N="472" REF="478"/>
in the preceding year, had detached from the Mediter∣ranean
Captain Hovenden Walker, with six ships of the
line and transports, having on board four regiments of
soldiers, for the Leeward islands. Being joined at Anti∣gua
by some troops under Colonel Codrington, they
made a descent upon the island of Guadaloupe, where they
raised the fort, burned the town, ravaged the country,
and re-embarked with precipitation, in consequence of a
report that the French had landed nine hundred men on
the back of the island. They retired to Nevis, where
they must have perished by famine, had not they been pro∣videntially
relieved by Vice-Admiral Graydon, in his
way to Jamaica. This officer had been sent out with three
ships to succeed Benbow, and was convoyed about one
hundred and fifty leagues by two other ships of the
line. He had not sailed many days, when he fell in with
part of the French squadron, commanded by Du Casse, on
their return from the West-Indies, very foul, and richly
laden. Captain Cleland, of the Montagu, engaged the
sternmost; but he was called off by a signal from the Ad∣miral,
who proceeded on his voyage, without taking further
notice of the enemy. When he arrived at Jamaica, he
quarrelled with the principal planters of the island; and
his ships beginning to be crazy, he resolved to return to
England. He, accordingly, sailed through the gulf of
Florida, with a view to attack the French at Placentia,
in Newfoundland: but his ships were dispersed in a fog
that lasted thirty days; and afterwards the council of war
which he convoked were of opinion that he could not
attack the settlement with any prospect of success. At
his return to England, the House of Lords, then sitting,
set on foot an enquiry into his conduct. They present∣ed
an address to the Queen, desiring she would remove
him from his employments; and he was accordingly dis∣missed.
The only exploit that tended to distress the ene∣my
was performed by Rear-Admiral Dilkes, who, in the
month of July, sailed to the coast of France with a small
<PB N="473" REF="479"/>
squadron; and in the neighbourhood of Granville, took
or destroyed about forty ships and their convoy. Yet this
damage was inconsiderable, when compared to that which
the English navy sustained from the dreadful tempest
that began to blow on the twenty-seventh day of Novem∣ber,
accompanied with such flashes of lightning and
peals of thunder, as overwhelmed the whole kingdom
with consternation. The Houses in London shook from
their foundations, and some of them falling, buried the
inhabitants in their ruins. The water over-flowed seve∣ral
streets, and rose to a considerable tide in Westmin∣ster-hall.
London-bridge was almost choaked up with
the wrecks of vessels that perished in the river. The loss
sustained by the capital was computed at a million ster∣ling;
and the city of Bristol suffered to a prodigious
amount: but the chief national damage fell upon the navy.
Thirteen ships of war were lost, together with fifteen
hundred seamen, including Rear-Admiral Beaumont, who
had been employed in observing the Dunkirk squadron,
and was then at anchor in the Downs, where his ship
foundered. This great loss, however, was repaired with
incredible diligence, to the astonishment of all Europe.
The Queen immediately issued orders for building a greater
number of ships than that which had been destroyed;
and she exercised her bounty for the relief of the ship∣wrecked
seamen, and the widows of those who were
drowned, in such a manner as endeared her to all her
subjects.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The Emperor having declared his second son
Charles king of Spain, that young prince set out from
Vienna to Holland, and at Dusseldorp was visited by the
Duke of Marlborough, who, in the name of his mistress,
congratulated him upon his accession to the crown of
Spain. Charles received him with the most obliging
courtesy▪ In the course of their conversation, taking off
his sword, he presented it to the English general, with a
very gracious aspect, saying, in the French language,
<PB N="474" REF="480"/>
“I am not ashamed to own myself a poor prince. I
possess nothing but my cloak and sword; the latter
may be of use to your Grace; and I hope you will
not think it the worse for my wearing it one day.”
“On the contrary (replied the Duke) it will always put
me in mind of your Majesty's just right and title, and
of the obligations I lie under to hazard my life in mak∣ing
you the greatest prince in Christe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom.”—This
nobleman returned to England in October; and King
Charles embarking for the same kingdom, under convoy
of an English and Dutch squadron, arrived at Spithead
on the twenty-sixth day of September. There he was
received by the Dukes of Somerset and Marlborough, who
conducted him to Windsor; and on the road he was met
by Prince George of Denmark. The Queen's deport∣ment
towards him was equally noble and obliging; and
he expressed the most profound respect and veneration for
this illustrious princess. He spoke but little; yet what
he said was judicious; and he behaved with such polite∣ness
and affability as conciliated the affection of the Eng∣lish
nobility. After having been magnificently entertain∣ed
for three days, he returned to Portsmouth, from
thence, on the fourth of January, he sailed for Portu∣gal,
with a great sleet commanded by Sir George Rooke,
having on board a body of land forces, under the Duke
of Schomberg. When the Admiral had almost reached
Cape Finisterre, he was driven back by a storm to Spit∣head,
where he was obliged to remain till the middle of
February. Then being favoured with a fair wind, he
happily performed the voyage to Lisbon, where King
Charles was received with great splendour, though the
court of Portugal was overspread with sorrow, excited by
the death of the Infanta, whom the King of Spain in∣tended
to espouse. In Poland, all hope of peace seemed
to vanish. The cardinal-primate, by the instigation of
the Swedish king, whose army lay encamped in the
neighbourhood of Dantzick, assembled a diet at Warsaw,
<PB N="475" REF="481"/>
which solemnly deposed Augustus, and declared the
throne vacant. Their intention was to elect young Sobies∣ki,
son of their late monarch, who resided at Breslaw, in
Silesia; but their scheme was anticipated by Augustus,
who retired hastily into his Saxon dominions, and seising
Sobieski, with his brother, secured them as prisoners at
Dresden.</P>
