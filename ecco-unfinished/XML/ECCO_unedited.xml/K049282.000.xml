<HEAD>THE LIFE OF T. SMOLLETT. M. D.</HEAD>
<P>DR. Tobias Smollett, an author whose writings will transmit his name with honour to poste∣rity, and whose virtues as a man deserve to be com∣memorated, was born about the year 1720 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Travels through France and Italy, Vol. I. p. 177; he speaks of his age in the year 1763, thus: <Q>“Annum aetatis post qua∣dragesimum tertium.”</Q></NOTE>, at a small village, within two miles of Cameron, on the banks of the river Leven <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Humphry Clinker, Vol. III. p. 41▪</NOTE>. He appears to have received a classical education, and was bred to the practice of physic and surgery. It is a trite remark, that the lives of authors are little more than an enu∣meration and account of their works; they are ge∣nerally so deficient in incident, that, after a com∣pleat catalogue of their writings is produced, nothing more can be added, except the times of their births
<PB N="ii" REF="40"/>
and deaths. If fame is in the least to be depended upon, this observation will not apply to Dr. Smollett. It is said, and probably with some truth, that the chief incidents in the early part of his life were given to the public in one of the first and best of his pro∣ductions, the novel of Roderick Random; however, whether that report is well founded or not, certain it is that he was at the siege of Carthagena in the capacity of a surgeon, or surgeon's mate, and in the before-mentioned novel has given a faithful, though no very pleasing, account of the manage∣ment of that ill-conducted expedition which he censures in the warmest terms, and from circum∣stances which fell under his own particular observa∣tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smollett is supposed to have been the editor of <Q>“A Com∣pendium of authentic Voyages, digested in a Chronological Series,”</Q> 7 vol. 12mo▪ published in 1756; amongst which is inserted a short narrative of the expedition to Carthagena, 1741; written with great spirit, but abounding with too much acrimony. This narrative we conceive to be a production written by the supposed editor.</NOTE>. His connection with the sea seems not to have had a long continuance, and it is probable that he wrote several pieces before he became known to the public by his capital productions. The first piece we know of with certainty is a Satire in two parts, printed first in the year 1746 and 1747,
<PB N="iii" REF="50"/>
and now reprinted in this collection of his poetical pieces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See p. 203.—About this period, or some time before, he wrote for Mr. Rich an opera, intitled Alceste, which has never been performed nor printed. The music to it was composed by Mr. Han∣del, who finding that no use was intended to be made of it, after∣wards adapted it to Mr. Dryden's lesser Ode for Saint Cecilia's Day▪ <HI>Hawkins's History of Music,</HI> Vol. I. p. 28. Vol. V. p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Very early in life (at the age of eighteen) he wrote a tragedy intitled The Regicide, founded on the story of the assassination of James I. of Scot∣land. In the Preface to the publication of this piece, by subscription in the year 1749, he bitterly exclaimed against false patrons, and the duplicity of theatrical managers. The warmth and impetuosity of his temper hurried him on this occasion into unjust reflections against the late Lord Lyttelton, and Mr. David Garrick; the character of the former he satirifed in his novel of Peregrine Pickle, and he added a burlesque of the monody written by that nobleman on the death of his Lady. Against Mr. Garrick he made illiberal ill-founded criticisms, and in his novel of Roderick Random, gave a very un∣fair representation of his treatment of him respect∣ing this tragedy. Of this conduct he afterwards re∣pented and acknowledged his errors, though in the subsequent editions of the novel, the passages which
<PB N="iv" REF="60"/>
were the hasty effusions of disappointment, are not as we think they should have been omitted. De∣sirous, however, of <Q>“doing justice in a work of truth for wrongs done in a work of fiction”</Q> (to use his own expression) in giving a sketch of the liberal arts in his History of England, he remarked, <Q>“”the exhi∣bitions of the stage were improved to the most exquisite entertainment by the talents and ma∣nagement of Garrick, who greatly surpassed all his predecessors of this and perhaps every other nation in his genius for acting, in the sweetness and variety of his tones, the irresistible magic of his eye, the fire and vivacity of his action, the elegance of attitude, and the whole pathos of expression.</Q></P>
<Q>“Candidates for literary fame appeared even in the higher sphere of life embellished by the ner∣vous sense and extensive erudition of a Corke, by the delicate taste, the polished muse, and tender feelings of a Lyttelton.”</Q>
<P>Not satisfied with this <HI>public</HI> declaration of his sentiments, he wrote in still stronger terms to Mr. Garrick;</P>

<P>In the year 1757, Dr. Smollett's Comedy of the Reprisals, an after-piece of two acts, was performed at Drury-lane theatre. He acknowledged himself
<Q><PB N="vi" REF="80"/>
“highly obliged for the friendly care of Mr. G. exerted in preparing it for the stage; and still more, for his acting the part of Lusignan, in Zara, for his benefit, on the sixth instead of the ninth night, to which he was only intitled by the custom of the theatre.”</Q> Being informed attempts had been made to embroil him on this occasion with Mr. G. he wrote to that gentleman:</P>

The imputation is altogether false and malicious. Exclusive of other considerations, I could not be such an ideot to talk in that strain when my own interest so immediately required a different sort of conduct. Perhaps the same insidious methods have been taken to inflame former animosities, which, on my part, are forgotten and self-con∣demned. I must own you have acted in this af∣fair of the farce with that candour, openness,
<PB N="vii" REF="90"/>

SMOLLETT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of Dr. Smollett's, desirous of evincing that he was capable of retracting his prejudices, and that his gratitude was equally warm with any other of his passions, prevailed on Mr. Garrick to permit the Editor to take copies of the foregoing letters from several others he had written to Mr. Garrick.</NOTE>."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In the year 1748 he published his novel of Ro∣derick Random, a book which still continues to have a most extensive sale, and first established the Doctor's reputation. All the first volume, and the beginning of the second, appear to consist of real incident and character, though certainly a good deal heightened and disguised. The judge, his grandfather, Crab and Potion, the two apotheca∣ries, and 'Squire Gawkey, were characters well known in that part of the kingdom where the scene was laid. Captains Oakhum and Whiffle, Doc∣tors Mackshane and Morgan, were also said to be real personages; but their names we have either ne∣ver learned, or have now forgotten. A bookbinder
<PB N="iii" REF="100"/>
and barber long eagerly contended for being shadow∣ed under the name of Strap. The Doctor seems to have enjoyed a peculiar felicity in describing sea characters, particularly the officers and sailors of the navy. His Trunnion, Hatchway, and Pipes, are highly-finished originals; but what exceeds them all, and perhaps equals any character that has yet been painted by the happiest genius of ancient or modern times, is his Lieutenant Bowling. This is indeed nature itself; original, <HI>unique,</HI> and <HI>sui generis.</HI> As well as the ladder of promotion, his very name has long become proverbial for an honest blunt sea∣man, unacquainted with mankind and the ways of the world.</P>
<P>By the publication of that work the Doctor had acquired so great a reputation, that henceforth a certain degree of success was insured to every thing known or suspected to proceed from his hand. In the course of a few years the adventures of Pe∣regrine Pickle appeared <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1751.</NOTE>; a work of great inge∣nuity and and contrivance in the composition, and in which an uncommon degree of erudition is dis∣played, particularly in the description of the enter∣tainment given by the Republican Doctor, after the manner of the ancients. Under this personage the late Dr. Akenside, author of a famous poem, in∣titled, The Pleasures of the Imagination, is sup∣posed
<PB N="ix" REF="110"/>
to be typified; and it would be difficult to de∣termine whether profound learning or genuine hu∣mour predominate most in this episode. Butler and Smollett seem to be the only two who have united things, seemingly so discordant, happily together; for Hudibras is one of the most learned works in any language; and it requires no common share of reading, assisted with a good memory, thoroughly to relish and understand it. Another episode of The Adventures of a Lady of Quality, likewise inserted in this work, contributed greatly to its success, and is indeed admirably well executed. Yet, after giv∣ing all due praise to the merit and invention dis∣played in Peregrine Pickle, we cannot help think∣ing it is inferior, in what may be called <HI>naïveté,</HI> a a thing better conceived than expressed, to Rode∣rick Random.</P>
<P>These were not the only original compositions of this stamp with which the Doctor has favoured the public. Ferdinand Count Fathom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Published in the year 1754.</NOTE> and Sir Launcelot Greaves <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">First printed in the British Magazine, and afterwards in 2 vols. 12mo, 1762.</NOTE>, are still in the list of what may be called reading novels; but there is no injustice in placing them in a rank far below the former. No doubt invention, character, composition, and contrivance, are to be found in both; but then situations are de∣scribed
<PB N="x" REF="120"/>
which are hardly possible, and characters are painted, which, if not altogether unexampled, are at least incompatable with modern manners; and which ought not to be, as the scenes are laid in mo∣dern times.</P>
<P>The last work which the Doctor published, was of much the same species, but cast into a different form—The Expedition of Humphry Clinker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 3 vols. 1771.</NOTE>. It consists of a series of letters, written by different persons to their respective correspondents. He has here carefully avoided the faults which may be justly charged to his two former productions. Here are no extravagant characters, nor unnatural situations. On the contrary, an admirable knowledge of life and manners is displayed; and most useful lessons are given applicable to interesting, but to very common situ∣ations.</P>
<P>We know not that ever the remark has been made, but there is certainly a very obvious similitude be∣tween the characters of the three heroes of the Doctor's chief productions. Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, and Matthew Bramble, are all brothers of the same family. The same satirical, cynical disposition, the same generosity and bene∣volence, are the distinguishing and characteristical
<PB N="xi" REF="130"/>
features of all three; but they are far from being servile copies or imitations of each other. They differ as much as the Ajax, Diomed, and Achilles of Homer. This was undoubtedly a great effort of genius; and the Doctor seems to have described his own character at the different stages and situations of his life.</P>
<P>Before he took a house at Chelsea, he attempted to settle as practitioner of physic at Bath; and, with that view, wrote a treatise on the waters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intitled, <Q>“An Essay on the external Use of Water, in a Letter to Dr.—, with particular Remarks upon the present Method of using the Mineral Waters at Bath, in Somersetshire, and a Plan for rendering them more safe, agreeable, and efficacious.”</Q> Quarto. 1752.</NOTE>; but was unsuccessful, chiefly because he could not render himself agreeable to the women, whose favour is certainly of great consequence to all candidates for eminence, whether in medicine or divinity. This, however, was a little extraordinary; for those who remembered Dr. Smollett at that time, cannot but acknowledge that he was as graceful and handsome a man as any of the age he lived in; be∣sides, there was a certain dignity in his air and man∣ner which could not but inspire respect wherever he appeared. Perhaps he was too soon discouraged; in all probability, had he persevered, a man of his
<PB N="xii" REF="140"/>
great learning, profound sagacity, and intense ap∣plication, besides being endued with every other external as well as internal accomplishment, must have at last succeeded, and, had he attained to com∣mon old age, been at the head of his profession.</P>
<P>Abandoning physic altogether as a profession, he fixed his residence at Chelsea, and turned his thoughts entirely to writing. Yet, as an author, he was not near so successful as his happy genius and acknowledged merit certainly deserved. He never acquired a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tron among the great, who, by his favour or beneficence, relieved him from the necessity of writing for a subsistence. The truth is, Dr. Smollett possessed a loftiness and elevation of sentiment and character which appears to have dis∣qualified him from currying favour among those who were able to confer favours. It would be wrong to call this disposition of his, pride or haugh∣tiness; for to his equals and inferiors he was ever polite, friendly, and generous. Booksellers may therefore be said to have been his only patrons; and from them he had constant employment in translating, compiling, and reviewing. He trans∣lated Gil Blas and Don Quixote <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 4to. 2 vols. 1755. Since his death a translation of Telemachus has alse appeared.</NOTE>, both so happily, that all the former translations of these excellent
<PB N="xiii" REF="150"/>
productions of genius are in a fair way of being su∣perseded by his. His name likewise appears to a translation of Voltaire's prose works, but little of it was done by his own hand; he only revised it, and added a few notes. He was concerned in great va∣riety of compilations. His History of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">First printed in 4 vols. 4to▪ 1757.</NOTE> was the principal work of that kind. It has in itself real intrinsic merit; but, considering the time and circumstances in which it was written, it is indeed a prodigy of genius, and a great effort of application. It had a most extensive sale, and the Doctor is said to received £ 2000, for writing it and the Continua∣tion. He was employed, during the last years of his life, in preparing a new edition of the Ancient and Modern Universal History, great part of which he had originally written himself, particularly the Histories of France, Italy, and Germany. He lived nearly to compleat this work, and it is said it will soon be published.</P>
<P>In the year 1755 he set on foot the Critical Re∣view, and continued the principal manager of it, till he went abroad for the first time in the year 1763. To speak impartially, he was, perhaps, too acrimonious sometimes in the conduct of that work, and at the same time too sore, and displayed too much sensibility when any of the unfortunate au∣thors
<PB N="xiv" REF="160"/>
whose works he had, it may be, justly cen∣sured, attempted to retaliate.</P>
<P>Among other controversies which his engage∣ments in this publication involved him, the most material in its consequences was that which was oc∣casioned by his remarks on a pamphlet published by Admiral Knowles. That gentleman, in defence of his conduct, on the expedition to Rochfort, pub∣lished a vindication of himself, which falling under the Doctor's examination, produced some very se∣vere strictures both on the performance as well as on the character of the writer of it. The Admiral immediately commenced a prosecution against the printer; declaring, at the same time, that he de∣sired only to be informed who the writer was, that, if he proved to be a gentleman, he might obtain the satisfaction of one from him. In this affair the Doctor behaved both with prudence and with spirit. Desirous of compromising the dispute with the Ad∣miral in an amicable manner, he applied to his friend Mr. Wilkes, to interpose his good offices with his opponent, in the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="xv" REF="170"/>

I shall be very proud to find myself comprehended in your league of∣fensive and defensive; nay, I consider myself al∣ready as a contracting party, and have recourse to the assistance of my allies. It is not, I be∣lieve, unknown to you that Admiral Knowles has taken exception at a paragraph in the Critical Review of last May, and commenced a prosecu∣tion against the printer. Now, whatever termi∣nation the trial may have, we shall infallibly be exposed to a considerable expence, and therefore I wish to see the prosecution quashed. Some gentlemen, who are my friends, have undertaken to find out, and talk with those who are supposed to have influence with the said Admiral: may I beg the same favour of you and your friends? The trial will come on in the beginning of May, and, if the affair cannot be compromised, we intend to kick up a dust, and die hard. In a word, if that foolish Admiral has any regard to his own
<PB N="xvi" REF="180"/>
character he will be quiet, rather than provoke further the resentment of,</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR, &amp;c.</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>"T. SMOLLETT."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Admiral continued inflexible; and just as sentence was going to be pronounced against the printer, the Doctor came into court, avowed him∣self the author of the Strictures, and declared him∣self ready to give Mr. Knowles any satisfaction he chose. The Admiral immediately commenced a fresh action against the Doctor, who was found guilty, fined £ 100, and condemned to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench. It is there he is said to have written The Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves, in which he has described some remarkable characters, then his fellow-prisoners.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the Review, Dr. Smollett was always considered as the author of it: by this means he became frequently censured on ac∣count of articles in which he had no concern. On the publication of the Rosciad, the author, consider∣ing himself and some of his friends as very injuri∣ously treated in the Review of that work, and ima∣gining Dr. Smollett the author of the offensive arti∣cle,
<PB N="xvii" REF="190"/>
retorted with great spirit in his excellent poem intituled An Apology to the Critical Reviewers, it appears however he was mistaken in his suspicion; for Dr. Smollett hearing that Mr. Colman had also accused him of having made an attack on his moral character in the Review, the Doctor exculpated him∣self from the charge, in a letter to Mr. G.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Chelsea, <DATE>April 5, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“”I see Mr. Colman has taken offence at the ar∣ticle in the Critical Review which treats of the Rosciad, and I understand he suspected me to be author of that article. Had he asked me the question I should have freely told him I was not the author of the offensive article, and readily contributed to any decent scheme which might have been proposed for his satisfaction: but, as he has appealed to the public, I shall leave him and the real author to settle the affair between themselves, and content myself with declaring to you, and that upon my honour, that I did not write one word of the article upon the Rosciad; that I have no ill-will nor envy to Mr. Colman, whom I have always respected as a man of genius, and whose genius I shall always be ready and
<PB N="xviii" REF="200"/>
pleased to acknowledge either in private or public. I envy no man of merit, and I can safely say I do not even repine at the success of those who have no merit. I am old enough to have seen and observed that we are all play-things of for∣tune; and that it depends upon something as in∣significant and precarious as the tossing up of a halfpenny, whether a man rises to affluence and honours, or continues to his dying day struggling with the difficulties and disgraces of life. I de∣sire to live quietly with all mankind, and if pos∣sible to be upon good terms with all those who have distinguished themselves by their extraor∣dinary merit. I must own that if I had examin∣ed the article upon the Rosciad before it was sent to the press I should have put my negative on some expressions in it, though I cannot see in it any reflection to the prejudice of Mr. Colman's moral character; but I have been so hurried since my enlargement that I had not time to write one article in the Critical Review, except that upon Bower's History, and perhaps I shall not write another these six months. That hurry and a bad state of health have prevented me from returning in person the visit you favoured me with in the King's Bench. I beg you will accept this letter in lieu of it, and believe that

no man respects Mr. Garrick more than he is respected by his obliged humble servant</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"T. SMOLLETT."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Besides these many other disputes arose with dif∣ferent writers who considered themselves injured by the severity of the Doctor's criticisms; indeed it may be affirmed that seldom a month passed with∣out a complaint on that head, and those not often couched in the most decent terms. But whatever reason he had to complain on that account, he soon after found that the revenge of an author was nothing compared to the rancour of the politician. In the year 1762 Lord Bute took the reins of go∣vernment into his hands. His promotion was at∣tended with many unpopular measures, great dissa∣tisfaction arose amongst many orders of men, and his lordship found it necessary to employ some able writers to palliate and defend the steps which had led to his advancement. Amongst others Dr. Smollett was pitched upon, and he entered on the task ap∣pointed for him with great spirit. In defence of his patron he immediately began a weekly paper which he called The Briton. The first number made its appearance on the 29th of May, 1762, and was immediately followed by the publication of the North Briton, which in the end entirely routed
<PB N="xx" REF="220"/>
its antagonist, and dissolved the friendship which had long subsisted between the authors of the re∣spective performances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Two months before the first number of the Briton appeared, Dr. Smollett wrote the following letter to Mr. Wilkes:</P>
<LETTER>

<P><Q>“”My warmest regard, affection and attachment, you have long ago secured.

I have been ill these three months, but hope soon to be in a condition to pay my respects to Mr. Wilkes in person. Mean while, I must beg leave to trouble him with another packet, which he will be so good as to consecrate at his leisure. That he may continue to enjoy his happy flow of spirits, and proceed through life with a flowing sail of prosperity and reputation, is the wish and the hope, and the confident ex∣pectation of</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>"HIS MUCH OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>"T. SMOLLETT."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>. The Briton continued to be published until the 12th of Februrary, 1763, when it was laid down; and very soon after the person, in whose defence it was set on foot, finding the stream of popular discontent too strong to be re∣sisted, relinquished the post which had excited so much envy and clamour, and on his resignation it is said entirely neglected all the persons whom he
<PB N="xxi" REF="230"/>
had employed to write for him. Besides the Briton Dr. Smollet is supposed to have written other pieces in support of the cause he espoused. The Adven∣tures of an Atom, in two volumes, are known to be his productions.</P>
<P>His constitution being at last greatly impaired by a sedentary life, and assiduous application to study, he went abroad for his health in the month of June 1763, and continued in France and Italy two years. He wrote an account of his travels in a se∣ries of letters to some friends, which were afterwards published in two volumes, octavo, 1766. During all that time he appears to have laboured under a constant fit of chagrin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A very slight perusal of these letters will sufficiently evince that this observation is founded in fact, and is indeed a melancholy in∣stance of the influence of bodily distemper over the best disposition. To this cynical relation of his Travels Mr. Sterne is supposed to al∣lude, in the following passage of his Sentimental Journey, vol. I. p. 86. <Q>“”The learned Smelfungus travelled from Bologne to Paris—from Paris to Rome—and so on—but he set out with the spleen and jaundice, and every object he passed by was discoloured and distorted—He wrote an account of them, but it was nothing but the account of his miserable feelings.—I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon—he was just coming out of it.</Q>—`It is nothing but a huge cockpit,' "said he."—<Q>“I wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus of Medicis,”</Q> <Q>“replied I—for in passing through Florence I had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet, without the least provocation in nature.—I popped upon Smelfungus again at Tu∣rin, in his return home, and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell, wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field, and of the cannibals which each other eat: the Anthropo∣phagi—He had been flayed alive, and bedeviled, and worse used than St. Bartholomew, at every stage he had come at.—`I'll tell it,' cried Smelfungus,”</Q> `to the world.'—`You had better tell it,' "said I," `to your physician.'</NOTE>. But the state of his mind
<PB N="xxii" REF="240"/>
will be best learned from himself. Thus he writes in his first letter: <Q>“In gratifying your curiosity I shall find some amusement to beguile the tedious hours; which without some such employment, would be rendered insupportable by distemper and disquiet. You knew and pitied my situa∣tion, traduced by malice, persecuted by faction, abandoned by false patrons, and overwhelmed by the sense of a domestic calamity, which it was not in the power of fortune to repair.”</Q> By this do∣mestic calamity he means the loss of his only child, a daughter, whom he loved with the tenderest af∣fection. The Doctor, after his return to his native country, finding his health continuing to decline, and meeting with fresh mortifications and disappoint∣ments, he went back to Italy, where he died on October the 21st, 1771, and since his death a monu∣ment hath been erected to his memory near Leghorn, on which is inscribed the following epitaph written
<PB N="xxiii" REF="250"/>
by his friend Dr. Armstrong, author of The Art of Preserving Health, and many other excellent pieces.</P>

<P>THE REGICIDE: OR, JAMES THE FIRST OF SCOTLAND; A TRAGEDY.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="340"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER reluctance I have to trouble the public, with a detail of the mortifica∣tions I have suffered, in my attempts to bring the ensuing performance on the stage, I think it a duty incumbent upon me, to declare my reasons for pre∣senting it in this extraordinary manner; and, if the explanation shall be found either tedious or trifling, I hope the candid reader will charge my impertinence upon those who drove me to the necessity of making such an ineffectual appeal.</P>
<P>Besides, I flatter myself, that a fair representation of the usage I have met with, will be as a beacon, to caution other inexperienced authors against the insincerity of managers, to which they might other∣wise become egregious dupes; and, after a cajoling
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="350"/>
dream of good fortune, wake in all the aggravation of disappointment.</P>
<P>Although I claim no merit from having finished a Tragedy at the age of eighteen, I cannot help thinking myself intitled to some share of indulgence, for the humility, industry and patience I have ex∣erted during a period of ten years, in which this unfortunate production hath been exposed to the censure of critics of all degrees; and in consequence of their several opinions, altered, and (I hope) amended, times without number.</P>
<P>Had some of those who were pleased to call them∣selves my friends, been at any pains to deserve the character, and told me ingenuously what I had to expect in the capacity of an author, when I first professed myself of that venerable fraternity, I should, in all probability, have spared myself the incredible labour and chagrin I have since undergone: but, as early as the year 1739, my play was taken into the protection of one of those little fellows who are sometimes called great men; and, like other or∣phans, neglected accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvii" REF="360"/>
Stung with resentment, which I mistook for con∣tempt, I resolved to punish this barbarous indiffe∣rence, and actually discarded my patron; consoling myself with the barren praise of a few associates, who, in the most indefatigable manner, employed their time and influence in collecting from all quar∣ters observations on my piece, which, in consequence of those suggestions, put on a new appearance al∣most every day, until my occasions called me out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>—Soon after my return, I and my production were introduced to a late Patentee, of courteous memory, who (rest his soul!) found means to amuse me a whole season, and then declared it impractica∣ble to bring it on till next year; advising me to make my application more early in the winter, that we might have time to concert such alterations as should be thought necessary for its successful appearance on the stage.—But I did not find my account in fol∣lowing this wholesome advice; for, to me, he was always less and less at leisure. In short, after sundry promises, and numberless evasions, in the course of which he practised upon me the whole art of pro∣crastination,
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="370"/>
I demanded his final answer, with such obstinacy and warmth, that he could no longer resist my importunity, and refused my Tragedy in plain terms.—Not that he mentioned any material objec∣tions to the piece itself, but seemed to fear my in∣terest was not sufficient to support it in the represen∣tation; affirming, that no dramatic composition, however perfect, could succeed with an English au∣dience by its own merit only; but must entirely de∣pend upon a faction raised in its behalf.—Incensed at this unexpected declaration, I reproached him bitterly for having trifled with me so long; and, like my brother Bayes, threatened to carry my per∣formance to the other house.</P>
<P>This was actually my intention, when I was given to understand by a friend, that a nobleman of great weight had expressed an inclination to peruse it; and that, as interest was requisite, I could not do better than gratify his desire with all expedition. I com∣mitted it accordingly to the care of my counsellor, who undertook to give me a good account of it in less than a fortnight: but four months elapsed be∣fore I heard any tidings of my play; and then it
<PB N="xxxix" REF="380"/>
was retrieved by pure accident (I believe) from the most dishonourable apartment of his lordship's house.</P>
<P>Enraged at the behaviour of this supercilious peer, and exceedingly mortified at the miscarriage of all my efforts, I wreaked my resentment upon the in∣nocent cause of my disgraces, and forthwith con∣demned it to oblivion, where, in all probability, it would have for ever slept, like a miserable abortion, had not a young gentleman of learning and taste waked my paternal sense, and persuaded me not only to rescue it from the tomb, where it had lain two whole years, but also to new model the plan, which was imperfect and undigested before, and mould it into a regular tragedy, confined within the unities of the drama.</P>
<P>Thus improved, it fell into the hands of a gen∣tleman who had wrote for the stage, and happened to please him so much, that he spoke of it very cor∣dially to a young nobleman, since deceased, who, in the most generous manner, charged himself with the care of introducing it to the public; and, in the
<PB N="xl" REF="390"/>
mean time, honoured me with his own remarks, in conformity to which, it was immediately altered, and offered by his lordship to the new manager of Drury-lane theatre. It was about the latter end of the season when this candid personage, to whom I owe many obligations for the exercises of patience he has set me, received the performance, which, some weeks after, he returned, assuring my friend that he was pre-engaged to another author, but if I could be prevailed upon to reserve it till the ensuing winter, he would bring it on.—In the interim, my noble patron left London, whither he was doomed never to return; and the conscientious manager next season, instead of fulfilling his own promise and my expectation, gratified the town with the production of a player, the fate of which every body knows.</P>
<P>I shall leave the reader to make his reflections on this event, and proceed to relate the other particulars of fortune, that attended my unhappy issue, which in the succeeding spring, had the good luck to ac∣quire the approbation of an eminent wit, who pro∣posed a few amendments, and recomended it to a
<PB N="xli" REF="400"/>
person, by whose influence, I laid my account with seeing it appear at last, with such advantage as should make ample amends for all my disappoint∣ments.</P>
<P>But here too, I reckoned without my host. The master of Covent Garden theatre, bluntly rejected it, as a piece altogether unfit for the stage; even after he had told me, in presence of another gentle∣man, that he believed he should not venture to find sault with any performance which had gained the good opinion of the honourable person who ap∣proved and recommended my play.</P>
<P>Baffled in every attempt, I renounced all hopes of its seeing the light, when a humane lady of quality interposed, so urgently in its behalf, with my worthy friend the other manager, that he very complaisantly received it again, and had recourse to the old mystery of protraction, which he exercised with such success, that the season was almost con∣sumed, before he could afford it a reading. My patience being by this time quite exhausted, I de∣sired a gentleman, who interested himself in my
<PB N="xlii" REF="410"/>
concerns, to go and expostulate with the vaticide: and indeed, this piece of friendship he performed with so much zeal, upbraiding him with his evasive and presumptuous behaviour, that the sage politician was enraged at his reprimand; and in the mettle of his wrath, pronounced my play a wretched piece, deficient in language, sentiment, character, and plan. My friend, who was surprised at the hardiness and severity of this sentence, asking how he come to change his opinion, which had been more favourable when the tragedy was first put into his hands; he answered, that his opinion was not al∣tered, neither had he ever uttered an expression in its favour.</P>
<P>This was an unlucky assertion—For, the other immediately produced a letter which I had received from the young nobleman two years before, be∣ginning with these words—</P>
<P><Q>“Sir, I have received Mr. L—'s answer; who says, he thinks your play has indubitable merit, but has prior promises to Mr. T—n, as an honest man, cannot be evaded.”</Q>—And
<PB N="xliii" REF="420"/>
concluding thus; <Q>“As the manager has promised me the choice of the season next year, if you'll be advised by me, rest it with me.”</Q></P>
<P>After having made some remarks suitable to the occasion, my friend left him to chew the cud of re∣flection, the result of which was, a message to my patroness, importing, (with many expressions of duty) that neither the circumstances of his compa∣ny, nor the advanced season of the year, would permit him to obey her command, but if I would wait till next winter, and during the summer, make such alterations as I had agreed to, at a conference with some of his principal performers, he would assuredly put my play in rehearsal, and in the mean time give me an obligation in writing, for my fur∣ther satisfaction—I would have taken him at his word, without hesitation, but was persuaded to dis∣pense with the proffered security, that I might not seem to doubt the influence or authority of her ladyship.—The play, however, was altered and presented to this upright director, who renounced his engagement, without the least scruple, apology, or reason assigned.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="430"/>
Thus have I in the most impartial manner, (per∣haps too circumstantially) displayed the conduct of those playhouse managers with whom I have had any concern, relating to my tragedy: and what∣ever disputes have happened between the actors and me, are suppressed as frivolous animosities unworthy of the reader's attention.</P>
<P>Had I suffered a repulse when I first presented my performance, I should have had cause to complain of my being excluded from that avenue to the pub∣lic favour, which ought to lie open to all men of genius; and how far I deserve that distinction, I now leave the world to decide; after I have, in justice to myself, declared that my hopes of success were not derived from the partial applause of my own friends only, but inspired (as some of my greatest enemies know) by the approbation of per∣sons of the first note in the republic of taste, whose countenance, I vainly imagined, would have been an effectual introduction to the stage.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, I hope the unprejudiced ob∣server will own, with indignation and disdain, that every disappointment I have endured, was an accu∣mulated
<PB N="xlv" REF="440"/>
injury; and the whole of my adversary's conduct, a series of the most unjustifiable equivoca∣tion and insolent absurdity: for, though he may be excusable in refusing a work of this kind, either on account of his ignorance or discernment, surely, neither the one nor the other can vindicate his dis∣simulation and breach of promise to the author.</P>
<P>Abuse of prerogative, in matters of greater im∣portance, prevails so much at present, and is so ge∣nerally overlooked, that it is almost ridiculous to la∣ment the situation of authors, who must either, at once, forego all opportunities of acquiring reputa∣tion in dramatic poetry, or humble themselves so, as to soothe the pride, and humour the petulance of a meer Goth, who, by the most preposterous dele∣gation of power, may become sole arbiter of this kind of writing.</P>
<P>Nay, granting that a bard is willing to prostitute his talents so shamefully, perhaps he may never find an occasion to practice this vile condescension to ad∣vantage: for, after he has gained admission to a pa∣tentee (who is often more difficult of access than a
<PB N="xlvi" REF="450"/>
sovereign prince) and even made shift to remove all other objections, an insurmountable obstacle may be raised by the manager's avarice, which will dis∣suade him from hazarding a certain expence on an uncertain issue, when he can fill his theatre without running any risk, or disobliging his principal actors, by putting them to the trouble of studying new parts.—</P>
<P>Besides, he will be apt to say within himself, <Q>“If I must entertain the town with variety, it is but natural that I should prefer the productions of my friends, or of those who have any friends worth obliging, to the works of obscure stran∣gers, who have nothing to recommend them but a doubtful superiority of merit, which, in all like∣lihood, will never rise in judgment against me.”</Q></P>
<P>That such have been the reflections of patentees, I believe no man of intelligence and veracity will deny; and I will venture to affirm, that on the strength of interest or connection with the stage, some people have commenced dramatic authors,
<PB N="xlvii" REF="460"/>
who otherwise would have employed their faculties in exercises better adapted to their capacity.</P>
<P>After what has been said, any thing by way of application would be an insult on the understanding of the public, to which I owe and acknowledge the most indelible obligation for former favours as well as for the uncommon encouragement I have received in the publication of the following play.</P>

<LG>
<L>AN ancient sage, when death approach'd his bed,</L>
<L>Consign'd to Pluto his devoted head;</L>
<L>And, that no fiend might hiss, or prove uncivil,</L>
<L>With vows and pray'rs, he fairly brib'd the Devil:</L>
<L>Yet neither vows nor pray'rs, nor rich oblation,</L>
<L>Cou'd always save the sinner—from damnation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus authors, tottering on the brink of fate,</L>
<L>The critick's rage with prologues deprecate;</L>
<L>Yet oft the trembling bard implores in vain,</L>
<L>The wit profess'd turns out a dunce in grain:</L>
<L>No plea can then avert the dreadful sentence,</L>
<L>He must be damn'd—in spite of all repentance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here Justice seems from her straight line to vary,</L>
<L>No guilt attends a fact involuntary;</L>
<L>This maxim the whole cruel charge destroys,</L>
<L>No poet sure was ever dull—by choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So pleads our culprit in his own defence,</L>
<L>You cannot prove his dullness is—prepense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He means to please—he owns no other view;</L>
<L>And now presents you with—a sea ragout.</L>
<L>A dish—howe'er you relish his endeavours,</L>
<L>Replete with a variety of flavours:</L>

<LG>
<PB REF="1710"/>
<L>A stout Hibernian, and ferocious Scot,</L>
<L>Together boil in our enchanted pot;</L>
<L>To taint these viands with the true fumet,</L>
<L>He shreds a musty, vain, French—martinet.</L>
<L>This stale ingredient might our porridge mar</L>
<L>Without some acid juice of English tar.</L>
<L>To rouse the appetite the drum soall rattle,</L>
<L>And the desert shall be a bloodless battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What heart will fail to glow, what eye to brighten,</L>
<L>When Britain's wrath arous'd begins to lighten!</L>

<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, if this be taking diversion on the water, God send me safe on English ground! and if ever I come in sight of the sea again, may a watry grave be my portion.—First, to be terrified with the thoughts of drowning—Secondly, to be tossed and tumbled about like a foot-ball—Thirdly, to be drenched with sea-water—Fourthly, to be stunk to death with pitch and tar and the savoury scent of my fellow-sufferers—Fifthly, to be racked with perpetual puking till
<PB N="128" REF="1730"/>
my guts are turned inside out—And sixthly and lastly, to be taken prisoner and plundered by the French!</P>
</SP>

<P>Enough—Enough—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough!—aye, and to spare—I wish I could give part to those who envy my good fortune—But, how will the good lady Bloomwell moralize when she finds her daughter Miss Harriet is fallen into the hands of Mon∣sieur de Champignon!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more—that reflection alarms me!—yet I have no∣thing to fear—as there is no war declared, we shall soon be released: and in the mean time the French will treat us with their usual politeness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox on their politeness! ah master! commend me to the blunt sincerity of the true surly British mastiff—The rascalion that took my purse bowed so low, and paid me so many compliments, that I ventured to argue the mat∣ter in hopes of convincing him he was in the wrong—
<PB N="129" REF="1740"/>
but he soon stopped my mouth with a vengeance, by clapping a cocked pistol to my ear, and telling me he should have the honour to blow my brains out—Ano∣ther of those polite gentlemen begged leave to ex∣change hats with me—A third fell in love with my silver shoe-buckles—Nay, that very individual nice buttock of beef, which I had just begun to survey with looks of desire, after the dismal evacuation I had undergone, was ravished from my sight by two famished French wolves, who beheld it with equal joy and astonishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess they plundered us with great dexterity and dispatch; and even Monsieur de Champignon the commander did not keep his hands clear of the pillage—An instance of rapaciousness I did not expect to meet with in a gentleman and an officer▪—Sure he will be∣have as such to Harriet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith! not to flatter you, Sir, I take him to be one of those fellows who owe their good fortune to nothing less than their good works—He first rifled your mistress and then made love to her with great gallantry—but you was in the right to call yourself her brother—if he knew
<PB N="130" REF="1750"/>
you were his rival you might pass your time very disa∣greeably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two officers on board, who seem to disap∣prove of his conduct; they would not be concerned in robbing us, nor would they suffer their soldiers to take any share of the prey, but condoled Harriet and me on our misfortune, with marks of real concern.</P>

<P>You mean lieutenent Oclabber and ensign Maclay∣more, a couple of damned renegadoes!—you lean upon a broken reed if you trust to their compassion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oclabber I knew at Paris, when I travelled with my brother, and he then bore the character of an honest man and a brave officer—The other is an Highlander, ex∣cluded, I suppose, from his own country on account of the late rebellion; for that reason, perhaps, more apt to pity the distressed.—I see them walking this way in close conference—While I go down to the cabin to visit my dear Harriet, you may lounge about and endeavour to over-hear their conversation.</P>

But, by my shoul I will maintain, after the breath is out of my body, that the English pea∣sure boat had no right to be taken before the declaration

<P>Devil burn me! but my bowels wept salt water to see her sweet face look so sorrowful!—och! the delicate creature!—she's the very moral of my own honey, dear Sheelah o'Shannaghan, whom I left big with child in the county of Fermenaghan, grammachree!—Ochone my dear Sheelah!—Look here, she made me this sword-belt, of the skin of a sea-wolf that I shot at the mouth of the Shannon—and I gave her at parting a nun's discipline to keep her sweet flesh in order—och!
<PB N="133" REF="1780"/>
my dear honey captain, cried she, I shall never do pe∣nance, but I will be thinking of you. Ah! poor Shee∣lah, she once met with a terrible misfortune gra: we were all a merry-making at the castle of Ballyclough: and so Sheelah having drank a cup too much, honey, fell down stairs out of a window. When I came to her she told me she was speechless; and by my shoul it was tree long weeks before she got upon her legs again: then I composed a lamentation in the Irish tongue—and sung it to the tune of Drimmendoo; but, a friend of mine, of the order of Shaint Francis, has made a relation of it into English, and it goes very well to the words of Elen-a-Roon.</P>

To conclude, he has promised to give you all the assistance in his power, and even to favour our escape; for, over and above his other mo∣tives, I find he longs to return to his own country, and thinks a piece of service done to an English gentleman may enable him to gratify that inclination.</P>

<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>There the friendship of Maclaymore will be of ser∣vice: for, as soon as our flight is known, he and his men, on pretence of being alert, will make such a bustle and confusion, that nothing can be done until we are out of their reach; and then we must trust to our own canvass and the trim of our vessel, which is a prime sailer.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Miss MACKLIN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>AYE—now I can with pleasure look around,</L>
<L>Safe as I am, thank heaven, on English ground—</L>
<L>In a dark dungeon to be stow'd away,</L>
<L>Midst roaring, thund'ring, danger and dismay;</L>
<L>Expos'd to fire and water, sword and bullet—</L>
<L>Might damp the heart of any virgin pullet—</L>
<L>I dread to think what might have come to paess,</L>
<L>Had not the British Lyon quell'd the Gallic ass—</L>
<L>By Champignon a wretched victim led</L>
<L>To cloister'd cell, or more detested bed,</L>
<L>My days in pray'r and fasting I had spent:</L>
<L>As nun or wife, alike a penitent.</L>
<L>His gallantry, so confident and eager,</L>
<L>Had prov'd a mess of delicate soupe—maigre:</L>
<L>To bootless longings I had fallen a martyr:</L>
<L>But heav'n be prais'd, the Frenchman caught a tartar.</L>
<L>Yet soft—our author's fate you must decree:</L>
<L>Shall he come safe to port, or sink at sea?</L>
<L>Your sentence, sweet or bitter, soft or sore,</L>
<L>Floats his frail bark, or runs it bump ashore.—</L>
<L><PB N="201" REF="2480"/>
Ye wits above restrain your awful thunder:</L>
<L>In his first cruise, 'twere pity he should founder,</L>
<L>[To the gal.</L>
<L>Safe from your shot he fears no other foe,</L>
<L>Nor gulph, but that which horrid yawns below,</L>
<L>[To the pit.</L>
<L>The bravest chiefs, ev'n Hannibal and Cato,</L>
<L>Have here been tam'd with—pippin and potatoe.</L>
<L>Our bard embarks in a more christian cause,</L>
<L>He craves not mercy; but he claims applause.</L>
<L>His pen against the hostile French is drawn,</L>
<L>Who damns him, is no Antigallican.</L>
<L>Indulg'd with fav'ring gales and smiling skies,</L>
<L>Hereafter he may board a richer prize.</L>
<L>But if this welkin angry clouds deform,</L>
<L>[Looking round the house.</L>
<L>And hollow groans portend the approaching storm:</L>
<L>Should the descending show'rs of hail redouble,</L>
<L>[To the gal.</L>
<L>And these rough billows hiss, and boil and bubble,</L>
<L>[To the pit.</L>
<L>He'll launch no more on such fell seas of trouble.</L>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON DR. SMOLLETT's ODE TO INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>LYRIC POETRY imitates violent and ardent passions. It is therefore bold, various, and impe∣tuous. It abounds with animated sentiments, glowing images, and forms of speech often unusual, but com∣monly nervous and expressive. The composition and arrangement of parts may often appear disordered, and the transitions sudden and obscure; but they are always natural, and are governed by the movements and va∣riations of the imitated passion. The foregoing ode will illustrate these observations.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Introduction is poetical and abrupt.</L>
<L>"Thy spirit, Independence, let me share!</L>
<L>"Lord of the lion-heart and eagle-eye,</L>
<L>"Thy steps I follow with my bosom bare,</L>
<L>"Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky."</L>
</LG>
<P>The picture exhibited in these lines is striking, because the circumstances are happily chosen, briefly, and distinctly delineated. It is sublime, because the images are few, and in themselves great and magnificent. The
<PB N="267" REF="3110"/>
"lion-heart and eagle-eye" suggest an idea of the high spirit and commanding aspect of Independence: and the poet following with "bosom bare" denotes, in a picturesque manner, the eagerness and enthusiam of the votary. The last circumstance is peculiarly happy.</P>
<P>"Nor heeds the storm that howls along the sky". It marks the scene: it is unexpected, and excites sur∣prize: it is great and awful, and exites astonishment. Combined with the preceding circumstance, it con∣veys a beautiful allegorical meaning; and signifies, that a mind truly independent is superior to adversity, and unmoved by external accidents. We may observe too, in regard to the diction, that the notions of sound and motion communicated by the words "howl" and "along," contribute, in a peculiar manner, to the sublimity of the description.</P>

<L>`Thy steps I follow with my bosom bare,</L>
<L>`Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.'</L>

<P>These lines are written in the true spirit of Lyric poe∣try. Without preparing the mind by a cool artificial introduction, rising gradually to the impetuosity of pas∣sion, they assail the imagination by an abrupt and sud∣den impulse; they vibrate through the soul, and fire us instantaneously with all the ardour and enthusiasm of
<PB N="268" REF="3120"/>
the poet. Many of the odes of Horace are composed in the same spirit, and produce similar effects. With∣out any previous argument or introduction, in the ful∣ness of passion and imagination, he breaks out in bold, powerful, and impetuous figures.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Quo me, Bacche, rapis, tui</L>
<L>"Plenum? Quae nemora aut quos agor in specus</L>
<L>"Velox mente nova?—</L>
<L>"Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem"—</L>
</LG>
<P>The poet, full of enthusiasm and admiration, continues his prosopopeia; and, in a strain of poetry exceedingly wild and romantic, gives us the genealogy of Inde∣pendence.</P>
<LG>
<L>"A goddess violated brought thee forth,</L>
<L>"Immortal Liberty, whose look sublime</L>
<L>"Hath bleached the tyrant's cheek in every varying clime."</L>
</LG>
<P>According to the acceptation of our author, Liberty means the security of our lives and possessions, and freedom from external force: Independence is of higher import, and denotes that internal sense and conscious∣ness of freedom which beget magnanimity, fortitude, and that becoming pride which leads us to respect our∣selves, and do nothing unworthy of our condition. Li∣berty therefore is, with perfect propriety, said to be
<PB N="269" REF="3130"/>
the mother of Independence, and Disdain his father—Disdain arising from indignation against an oppressor, and triumph on having frustrated or escaped his ma∣lice. This stern personage is strongly characterized in the following direct description.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Of ample front the portly chief appear'd:</L>
<L>"The hunted bear supply'd a shaggy vest;</L>
<L>"The drifted snow hung on his yellow beard;</L>
<L>"And his broad shoulders braved the furious blast."</L>
</LG>
<P>Men may enjoy liberty without independence: they may be secure in their persons and possessions, without feeling any uncommon elevation of mind, or any sense of their freedom. But if their liberty is attacked, they are alarmed, they feel the value of their condition, they are moved with indignation against their oppressors, they exert themselves, and if they are successful, or escape the danger that threatened them, they triumph, they reflect on the happiness and dignity conferred by freedom, they applaud themseves for their exertions, be∣come magnanimous and independent. There is therefore no less propriety in deducing the origin of Independence from Disdain and Liberty, than in fixing the aera of his birth. The Saxons, according to our author, free, simple, and inoffensive, were attacked, escaped the violence of their adversary, reflected on the felicity of their condition, and learned independence.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="3140"/>
The education of Independence, and the scene of his nativity, are suited to his illustrious lineage, and to the high atchievements for which he was destined.</P>
<LG>
<L>"The light he saw in Albion's happy plains,</L>
<L>"Where under cover of a flowering thorn,</L>
<L>"While Philomel renewed her warbled strains,</L>
<L>"The auspicious fruit of stol'n embrace was born—</L>
<L>"The mountain Dryads seized with joy,</L>
<L>"The smiling infant to their charge consign'd;</L>
<L>"The Doric muse caressed the favourite boy;</L>
<L>"The hermit Wisdom stored his opening mind.'—</L>
</LG>
<P>The imagery in these lines is soft and agreeable, the language smooth, and the versification numerous.</P>
<P>Independence thus descended, and thus divinely in∣structed and endowed, distinguishes himself accordingly by heroic and beneficent actions.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Accomplish'd thus, he winged his way,</L>
<L>"And zealous roved from pole to pole,</L>
<L>"The rolls of right eternal to display,</L>
<L>"And warm with patriot thoughts the aspiring soul."</L>
</LG>
<P>The ode may be divided into three parts. The poet sets out with a brief address to Independence, imploring his protection. He sees, in idea, the high object of his adoration, and, transported by an ardent and irresistible impulse, he rehearses his birth, education, and quali∣ties.
<PB N="271" REF="3150"/>
He proceeds, in the second place, to celebrate his office and most renowned atchievements; and re∣turns, at the end of the third strophe, to acknowledge with gratitude the protection he had requested, and the power of Independence in preserving him untainted by the debasing influences of Grandeur, and the admira∣tion of vain magnificence. Animated with this reflec∣tion, and conscious of the dignity annexed to an inde∣pendent state of mind, he inveighs against those <Q>“Mi∣nions of Fortune”</Q> who would impose upon mankind by the ostentation of wealth, and the parade of pa∣geantry.</P>
<LG>
<L>"In Fortune's car behold that minion ride,</L>
<L>"With either India's glittering spoils opprest:</L>
<L>"So moves the sumpter-mule, in harness'd pride,</L>
<L>"That bears the treasure which he cannot taste.</L>
<L>"For him let venal bards disgrace the bay;</L>
<L>"And hireling minstrels wake the tinkling string:</L>
<L>"Her sensual snares let faithless Pleasure lay;</L>
<L>"And all her gingling bells fantastic Folly ring;</L>
<L>"Disquiet, Doubt, and Dread, shall intervene;</L>
<L>"And Nature, still to all her feelings just,</L>
<L>"In vengeance hang a damp on every scene,</L>
<L>"Shook from the baleful pinions of Disgust."</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="272" REF="3160"/>
These lines, embellished by fancy, and recommended to the heart by harmony, are the invective of truth and honest indignation.</P>
<P>In the last antistrophe the poet descends from his en∣thusiasm; he is less impetuous; the illustrious passions that animated and impelled him are exhausted; but they leave his mind full of their genuine and benign influences, not agitated and disordered, as if their tendency had been vicious, but glowing with self-ap∣probation, soft, gentle, and composed.</P>
