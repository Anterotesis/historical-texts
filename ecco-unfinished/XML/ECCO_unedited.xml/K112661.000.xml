<HEAD>This Book is dedicated</HEAD>
<P>TO that man, whenever he may appear, who, blessed with a soul superior to all lucrative and ambi∣tious views, will dare to stand forth the generous advocate and benevolent protector of the publick welfare— Who, when in office, will make the good of his fellow subjects the sole rule of his administration; and who, when out of office, independent of every partial connection, will stea∣dily and uniformly adhere to the same honest plan—Who, while in power, will boldly oppose all mea∣sures, however profitable to himself
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>
or his friends, that may be detri∣mental to the cause of his country; and who, when deprived of power, unshaken by present disappointments, or uninfluenced by future expectati∣ons, will as boldly support every measure, which may be beneficial to that cause, though it originates from his most hated adversary.</P>
<P>Such a man may be justly honour∣ed with the glorious title, hitherto, alas! ideal! which in all ages has been frequently conferred, but, per∣haps, never yet merited, of a</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Diary is printed from a manuscript of the late Lord Melcombe's, and as the reader may be inquisitive to know the stages, through which it came into my possession, I shall briefly satisfy his curiosity.</P>
<P>Lord Melcombe died in the year 1762, and bequeathed his whole property, (a few legacies excepted) to his cousin, the late Thomas Wyndham of Hammersmith.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Wyndham, who died in the year 1777, left, among many other kind remembrances, a clause in his will in the following words "I give to Henry Pen∣ruddocke Wyndham all my books, and all the late Lord Melcombe's political papers, letters, and poems, requesting of him not to print or publish any of them, but those
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
that are proper to be made publick, and such only, as may, in some degree, do honour to his memory."</P>
<P>The latter part of this clause has, hitherto, made me hesitate on the propriety of making his Lordship's Diary publick; for although it may reflect a considerable degree of ho∣nour on his Lordship's abilities, yet, in my opinion, it shews his political conduct, (however palliated by the ingenuity of his own pen) to have been wholly directed by the base motives of avarice, vanity, and selfishness.</P>
<P>What, beside these motives, induced him to quit the service of George II. and to prefer the protection of Frederick, Prince of Wales, to that of his old master? alas! he could not then foresee the black cloud, which was preparing to obscure the ex∣pected glory of the rising sun, and to blast the hopes of all its worshippers.</P>
<P>What, beside these motives, made his Lordship discontented and miserable, while
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
he remained in the court of that Prince? a party was, there, quickly combined against him, which, unfortunately for Lord Mel∣combe, was actuated by the same selfish principles, as he himself was.</P>
<P>What, beside these motives, tempted him, after the death of the Prince of Wales, to court the Pelhams with the most abject and fawning servility, and, at the same time, in secret opposition to his great patroness, the Princess Dowager?</P>
<P>But all this may be strictly honourable within the verge of a court; and, on this account, I could patiently hear his Lord∣ship recommend Mr. Ralph, as a very honest man, and in the same pages inform us, that he was ready to be hired to any cause; that he actually put himself to auction to the two contending parties (the Bedford and Pelhams) and that, after several bid∣dings, the <HI>honest</HI> Mr. Ralph was bought by the Pelhams.</P>
<P>However, I cannot patiently forgive the
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>
violent declamation of his Lordship against "<HI>the low and venal wretches of Bridgewater</HI>;" as if a bribe, taken by a miserable voter, and, possibly, for the support of a nume∣rous and indigent family, was more dis∣honourable, than a place or pension, en∣joyed or coveted by the opulent, for the sole purposes, either of accumulating riches, or of extending the pomp of pride and power.</P>
<P>I am aware that, in treating the cha∣racter of my Author thus freely, I shall appear as a very extraordinary Editor, the practice of whom has generally been, to prefer flattery to truth, and partiality to justice. But it may be worth considering, whether my method or the common one is the less injurious to the character of an Author; and whether the reader may not be more inclined to overlook or pardon those errors, which he is previously in∣structed to expect, than he would be, if every page contradicted the favourable im∣pressions, which the Editor had been in∣dustriously labouring to fix on his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8"/>But it is now time to answer a very na∣tural question, how could I, with such sentiments of the Diary, venture to pub∣lish it, consistent with the clause in the will?</P>
<P>To what I have said before, that the Diary was written by Lord Melcombe, I shall add, that every part of it was care∣fully copied from rough drafts, and that scarcely a blot or correction is to be seen throughout the whole. The month also, and each day of the week, is accurately inscribed on the margin, with his own pen, in printing characters.</P>
<P>From these circumstances I conclude, that Lord Melcombe wrote for the public, and that he intended his Diary should, in a future season, be produced to light: it is also manifest, that his Lordship meant it as an apology for his political conduct, and that he could not write it merely for amusement, or solely for his own retros∣pection, or for the private perusal only of his heirs.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9"/>The late Mr. Wyndham, through whose hands the MS. came to me, was of this opinion.</P>
<P>It seems therefore that, in publishing this Diary, I am certainly fulfilling Lord Melcombe's design, and doing what he anticipated some one or other should do; it is to be supposed that, in his opinion, there is nothing dishonourable in the Diary, and to his judgment I am in duty bound to sacrifice my own: the prejudices, perhaps, of education have instilled in my mind ideas of honour, very different from those of his Lordship, which —
<Q><L>— putavi</L>
<L>Stultus ego huic nostrae similes—</L></Q></P>
<P>But, notwithstanding, if I thought that any part of the Diary would tend to make one worthy character unhappy, or cause the smallest injury to the common good, I should, without hesitation, suppress it: nay, I would instantly commit it to the flames, lest it might hereafter be productive of those consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="10"/>If, on the contrary, by unveiling the mysterious intrigues of a court, and by exposing the latent causes of opposition, the Diary teaches us, that both one and the other may act from the same interested and corrupt principle; it may then make us cautiously diffident of the motives of either, and the country gentlemen, in particular, may learn from it, that they have as much to dread from those, who are in pursuit of power, as from those in actual possession of it; from those, who are, hopefully, working in the cold climate of disappoint∣ment, as from those, who are luxuriously basking in the sunshine of enjoyment.</P>
<P>The Diary may even animate those gentle∣men to the love of true patriotism, and, pro∣bably, instruct them to be more attentive to the <HI>measures</HI> of Administration, than to the <HI>parties</HI> which form it; and may check and controul that restless aversion to all goverment, so prevalent amongst them, and against which, the best Minister is no more secure than the worst.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="11"/>For have we not sometimes seen? when, after a long and laborious struggle, they have at length placed their favourite pilot at the helm; that, before they have suffered him to hold the rudder for one voyage, they have been as violent in their efforts of removing him, as they had been in rais∣ing him to it?</P>
<P>I think it necessary to observe, that I have not published the Diary quite entire, as it would be no entertainment to the reader to be informed, who daily dined with his Lordship, or whom he met at the tables of other people.</P>
<P>Such and some other trivial particulars I have omitted, but I have been careful not to alter any part of the original writ∣ing, for, though some obscurities darken a few passages (which, indeed, might na∣turally be expected from his Lordship's circumstantial manner of reciting long conversations) yet, I have not presumed
<PB N="xv" REF="12"/>
to give them my explanation, being of opinion that the reader has an equal right, with myself, to put his own construction upon them.</P>
<P>Some trifling anecdotes, however, may still appear in the present volume, such as the disputes of the Dorset family; the Bridgewater, and other elections, &amp;c. but these are so interwoven and connected with the general matter, and so often referred to, that I could not, with pro∣priety, reject them, lest the whole might, otherwise, seem embarrassed and unintelligible.</P>

<PB REF="13"/>
<HEAD>THE DIARY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this year, I was<MILESTONE N="1749."/> grievously afflicted with the first fit of the gout, which, with a fall that strained one leg and wounded the other, confined me to my chamber near three months.</P>
<P>During my illness, several kind expres∣sions from the Prince towards me, were reported to me, and on the 8th of March,<MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Mar."/> his Royal Highness ordered the Earl of Middlesex, his Master of the Horse, to send Mr. Ralph (whom he had often talked to about me) with a message from his Royal Highness, to offer me the full return of his favour, and to put the principal direction of his affairs into my hands.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Ralph, that I desired the two following days to consider of it; and
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
that he should have my answer at twelve o'clock, on Saturday the 11th instant.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Mar."/>This day in the morning I wrote to Mr. Pelham, desiring him, as I was not able to go out, to wait upon the King, and in my name humbly to resign, into his Majesty's hands, my office of Treasurer of the Navy.</P>
<P>The same day I gave Mr. Ralph my answer in writing to the Prince's gracious message, to be delivered to the Earl of Middlesex, taking his honour, that he would lay it before his Royal Highness, which Mr. Ralph performed, as did also his Lordship.</P>
<P>The same morning, I received a very civil letter from Mr. Pelham, testifying his concern and surprize at my resolution, and desiring that he might see me, before he delivered my message to the King, and ac∣quainting me, that he would come to me on Monday the 13th in the morning, be∣fore
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
he went to court, being then just go∣ing into the country.</P>
<P>This day early in the morning, Mr.<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Mar."/> Pelham made me a long visit with much ci∣vility, he seemed to wish much that this af∣fair might go no farther. I told him that I saw the country in so dangerous a condi∣tion, and found myself so incapable to con∣tribute to its relief and so unwelcome to attempt it; that I thought it misbecame me any longer to receive great emoluments from a country, whose service I could not, and if I could, I should not be suffered to promote: so I begged him to execute my commission to the King, and then we parted.</P>
<P>He came to me again, about eleven o'clock, to let me know that the King ac∣cepted my resignation very graciously, but expected that I would continue to act, till he could fix upon a proper successor. I did so, and was continued in the office till the 3d of May.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="16"/>The Prince was extremely kind to me, <MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July"/>and often admitted me to the honour of supping with him and the Princess. But on Saturday the 16th of July, going to Carleton House, to make my compliments before I went to Eastbury, he ordered me to sup with him, and invited me to spend the day with him, at Kew, on the following Tuesday, being the 18th, want∣ing, as he was pleased to say, to talk to me about business.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="July"/>This day I arived at Kew about eleven o'clock. The Prince received me most kindly, and told me he desired me to come into his service upon any terms, and by any title I pleased: that he meant to put the principal direction of his affairs into my hands: and what he could not do for me in his present situation, must be made up to me in futurity. All this in a man∣ner, so noble and frank, and with expres∣sions so full of affection and regard, that I ought not to remember them, but as a debt, and to perpetuate my gratitude. This passed before dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17"/>After dinner, he took me into a private room, and of himself began to say, that he thought I might as well be called Trea∣surer of the Chambers, as any other name: that the Earl of Scarborough, his Trea∣surer, might take it ill, if I stood upon the establishment with higher appointments than he did: that his Royal Highness's destination was, that I should have 2000<HI>l. per annum</HI>. That he thought it best to put me upon the establishment at the highest salary, only, and that he would pay me the rest himself. I humbly desired, that I might stand upon the establishment without any salary, and that I would take what he now designed for me, when he should be King, but nothing before. He said, that it became me, to make him that offer, but it did not become him to accept it, consistent with his reputation, and therefore, it must be in present. He then immediately added, that we must settle what was to happen in reversion, and said, that he thought a Peerage with the management of the House of Lords, and the seals of Secretary of State, for the
<PB N="6" REF="18"/>
Southern Province, would be a proper station for me, if I approved of it. Per∣ceiving me to be under much confusion at this unexpected offer, and at a loss how to express myself; he stopped me, and then said, I now promise you on the word and honour of a Prince, that, as soon as I come to the Crown, I will give you a Peerage and the Seals of the Southern Province. Upon my endeavouring to thank him, he repeated the same words, and added (putting back his chair) and I give you leave to kiss my hand upon it, now, by way of acceptance, which I did accordingly.</P>
<P>He then continued to say, that he would provide for my friends, whom he knew I valued more than myself: that he pro∣mised Mr. Furnese, the Treasury: Sir Francis Dashwood, the Treasury of the Navy, or Cofferrer: Mr. Henley, Solicitor General, and gave me leave to tell them so, adding, that he would confirm it to them himself. Lord Talbot I was to settle with, when I saw him in Dorsetshire. We agreed,
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
that he should send for me to Cliefden, when he was settled there, where the war∣rant should be ordered, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the conversation before dinner, I had taken the opportunity to beg the Princess's protection, who answered me in the most obliging manner.</P>
<P>I saw Mr. Furnese and Mr. Ralph at<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="July"/> Hammersmith, to whom I related all that had passed, and promised Mr. Ralph, that he should be my Secretary, if I lived to have the Seals.</P>
<P>Went to Eastbury.<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="July"/></P>
<P>Lord Talbot came over to me at East∣bury.<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="July"/> I acquainted him with this whole transaction; he promised to support me to the utmost, and to do the Prince all possible service: but would accept no re∣version.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Dashwood and his Lady<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="July"/> came to Eastbury. I informed him also
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
of all that had passed. He received, with much pleasure, both what related to him∣self and to me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Aug."/>Mr. Bance came to Eastbury, whom also I acquainted with all that had passed between the Prince and me, and offered him my endeavour to procure for him the reversion of the Remittances, or of the Board of Trade, if he had a mind to leave the city. He received my narrative with much pleasure, and my offers with great kindness and affection; protesting that he had no wish, but to remain always my faithful friend and servant, and desired, nor would have, nothing. But upon my pressing him, he said, that if it must be so, he should chuse the Remittances, and to have the secret and government of the Bank, as what he thought, would render him most useful to his friends; to which I agreed, and promised to undertake the affair with the Prince.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Sept."/>I received the Prince's commands, by
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>
the Earl of Egmont, to attend him at Cliefden.</P>
<P>Lord Shaftesbury came this morning:<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Sept."/> I opened part of the Prince's scheme to him: he seemed pleased and willing to assist; and thought he could answer for Lord Foley, and promised to try him.</P>
<P>Returned to Gunnersbury.<MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Sept."/></P>
<P>Saw Mr. Ralph, and talked with him<MILESTONE N="12, 13." UNIT="Sept."/> about Lord Egmont's acquainting Cary with the whole transaction between him and me.</P>
<P>Went from Gunnersbury to Cliefden.<MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Sept."/> Well received by all the family. There were besides, the Earl of Bute and Lord Chief Justice Willes.</P>
<P>Dined with their Royal Highnesses at<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Sept."/> Park Place. Lord Chief Justice went from thence to Henley.</P>
<P>Orders to Mr. Drax, by Lord Egmont,<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Sept."/> to make out my warrant. Received an
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
account that Lord Cobham died on Wed∣nesday the 13th.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Sept."/>The Prince and Lord Egmont went to Town from Cliefden. The Princess to Kew. They returned thither about nine. I met them at ten. Lord Bathurst came to Cliefden in the morning, and from thence to Kew.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Sept."/>Sir William Stanhope came to Cliefden.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Sept."/>At Ashley. Sent an ode to the Prin∣cess, with a letter, by her command.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Sept."/>Received an answer from the Princess.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Sept."/>Heard the news of the death of Sir Watkin Williams, by a fall from his horse.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="Oct."/>Kissed the Prince's and Princess's hands, as Treasurer of the Chambers. Supped with their Royal Highnesses and Madame de Mirepoix, the French Ambassadress.
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>
The Prince pretty eager about opposi∣tion.</P>
<P>Kissed the King's hand at Kensing∣ton.<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."/> Was civilly received. Wrote to Lady Middlesex about what passed last night. Sent a servant to the Grange with a letter to Mr. Henley, and wrote to Mr. Waller.</P>
<P>Set out from London. Met an answer<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Oct."/> from Mr. Henley; not so full as I expect∣ed. Lay at Sutton, and arrived at East∣bury the following day.</P>
<P>Mr. Drax came to Eastbury; he says,<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Oct."/> Lady Middlesex is cunning and silly, and warns me against her.</P>
<P>Went to Lord Shaftesbury's, and left him<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Oct."/> very well disposed; found General Chol∣mondley there—at my return found Mr. Henley, shewed him Lord Egmont's let∣ter, and my answer, and the heads which I designed from the Prince. He seemed
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>
to approve, and promised to promote every thing according to my system.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Oct."/>Mr. Henley went away.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Oct."/>Arrived at Hammersmith.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Oct."/>Sent a memorial with a letter to the Prince—waited on their Royal Highnesses. They lay at Kew, and ordered me to attend them the next day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Oct."/>Came to Kew at two. Walked with the Princess alone till four. Dined and supped there. Lords Inchiquin and Bute, Ladies Middlesex and Howe, Mr. Breton and I.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Oct."/>At Leicester House. The Grenvilles presented for the title of Temple. Sup∣ped at Carleton House—Their Royal High∣nesses, Ladies Middlesex, Howe, Madame de Mirepoix; Lords Bute and North.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Oct."/>Went to Cliefden with their Royal Highnesses. Lords Inchiquin and Bathurst
<PB N="13" REF="25"/>
met us. The Princess talked to me about Lord North for a governor to Prince George, which I approved of.</P>
<P>We all went to Ouborn Fair; Prince<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Oct."/> George in our coach.</P>
<P>The Princess talked much to me about<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Oct."/> the Earl of Granville.</P>
<P>We left Cliefden—dined and supped at<MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Oct."/> Kew, and left the children there. We came to town about one.</P>
<P>King's birth-day kept. I was at St.<MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Oct."/> James's. Then at Carleton House; went to dine with Sir Samuel Pennant, Lord Mayor, by the Prince's command. No∣body at the feast between the Lord Chan∣cellor and me.</P>
<P>Dined and supped at Kew. The Prince<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Nov."/> read to me an answer to my memorial written with his own hand. The differ∣ence in opinion between us is not con∣siderable.
<PB N="14" REF="26"/>
The piece is astonishingly well drawn.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Nov."/>I dined at Carleton House. The com∣pany, only the Prince, the Earl of Eg∣mont and Dr. Lee. Our business, the immediate steps to be taken upon the de∣mise of the King, more particularly with relation to the Civil List. His Royal Highness said, he had had three methods proposed to him: the first was to let the present Ministers settle it, and then part with them and the Parliament. The second was, to dismiss four or five of the principals, but to vote the civil list before the Parliament was dissolved. The third, (which he was pleased to say, he thought was my opinion) was to dismiss the Par∣liament immediately, to turn all those out whom he did not design to continue, and to throw himself upon the country, for a new Parliament, and a provision for himself and family, which he desired should be only a clear annuity of 800,000<HI>l.</HI> giving back the duties to the Public, with whatever surplus might attend it. The
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>
first proposition his Royal Highness put out of the question: the second and third,<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Oct."/> he desired that he might be fully satisfied upon from a full consideration; because what was there determined, he would un∣alterably stand by, when communicated, and agreed to by the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Baltimore, and Lord Chief Justice Willes. It was discussed, and we were all, at last, of opinion, that the third proposition was the greatest, most popular and the best. His Royal Highness came heartily into it, gave us his hand, and made us take hands with each other to stand by, and support it. I undertook to find 2 or 300,000<HI>l.</HI> to go on with, till a new Parliament could grant the civil list.</P>
<P>I kissed the Duke's hand. Saw the<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Oct."/> Earl of Carlisle; he was for the second proposition, and for keeping the Prince's destination of employments secret, because he was unwilling the Pelhams should know they were desperate with him: he did not see how the House of Lords could be carried on without the Earl of Granville.
<PB N="16" REF="28"/>
Sir Paul Methuen was for the third pro∣position.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Oct."/>Lord Middlesex and Mr. Ralph came in the evening—much talk about bringing the Prince's affairs to some regulation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Oct."/>Dined at Carleton House—The Prince, Earls of Carlisle and Egmont, Lord Chief Justice Willes, Lord Baltimore, Sir John Rushout, Messrs. Gibbon, Lee, Henley, Nugent, Sir Thomas Bootle and I. Agreed not to oppose the Address, unless there should be something very strong in it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Oct."/>The session of Parliament opened with a very modest Speech. The Address, moved by Mr. Charles Townshend, and seconded by Sir Danvers Osborne, I thought a very unexceptionable one, and I did not oppose it. Sir John Hynde Cotton did, upon the Peace not being compleat, as is there said. The Earl of Egmont then made a violent and very injudicious speech against the Address, throwing out every thing he could think, or had heard
<PB N="17" REF="29"/>
of against the Ministry. Lord Baltimore said but little on the same side, and so the<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Nov."/> matter dropt, and the Address was voted. I went to the Prince before I dined, to give him an account of what had passed: He did not seem to make much account of it, one way or another.</P>
<P>Lady Mary Coke appeared at the King's<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Nov."/> Bench, and obtained leave for lawyers, all her relations, and the Earl of Pem∣broke to come to her. Lord Middlesex and Mr. Furnese came to me in the even∣ing. Much serious conversation about the behaviour, in and out of Parliament, of the Princes family, and of our situation in it. Agreed that it must be altered, or that I could be of no use there, and con∣sequently could not stay. Earl of Mid∣dlesex undertook to talk to the Prince a∣bout it. I was presented to the Princess Amelia and kissed her hand.</P>
<P>The Princess's birth-day: but not kept<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Nov."/> till Wednesday, because Queen Caroline died on the 20th. The Prince ordered
<PB N="18" REF="30"/>
me to signify, that he would not meddle with the Westminster election.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Nov."/>Mr. Bodens informed me that Mr. Douglas, at Lord Robert Bertie's, said, that I solicited to come into the Prince's family, agreeing not to be at the head; Dr. Lee was at the head.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Nov."/>The Princess's birth-day was kept. Dined with me the following publick Ministers; Marquis de Mirepoix, Comte de Haslang, Mons. le General Comte de Lucchesi, Mons. le General Wall, Mons. le Comte de Fleming, Mons. le Comte de Perrou, Mons. l'Abbé de Grossa-testa. Mess. les Chevaliers de Levy, de Laurency, de Tessier. Mons. d'Andrada, Mons. d' Abriau, Mons. le Comte d'Einsiddell, Mons. le Baron Kraygill, Mons. de Fioren, Lord Tyrawley and Mr. Breton. I went to Lord Middlesex: (who had been with me in the morning to tell me that the Prince had sent for him on Sunday, that his Royal Highness seemed much heated, having heard from Lord Baltimore, that
<PB N="19" REF="31"/>
I was in a great passion at what passed in Parliament last Thursday, and declared that I would have voted against them, if they had divided upon the Address.— Asked if such behaviour was not intolera∣ble. Lord Middlesex assured him, that I talked it over to him, in the House, with great calmness and without the least pas∣sion; that Lord Baltimore joined us for a little time, and seemed to be of our opi∣nion; that he, Lord Middlesex, as well as I, thought that the Address should have gone without opposition, and that Lord Egmont's speech was very injudicious, &amp;c. but the Prince seemed of a contrary opinion, and the conversation ended (by directing Lord Middlesex to quiet me.) I went, as I said before, to Lord Middlesex in the evening, and we had much talk. Both Lord and Lady Middlesex were of opinion, that a party was made against me in the family, and that it was best to come to an explanation with the Prince. I sup∣ped with their Royal Highnesses at Carle∣ton House. Lords Bute and Inchiquin, Ladies Middlesex and Howe.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="32"/>Was to wait on the Prince, who ap∣pointed <MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Nov."/>me Friday at twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>Went to council. The King present. Ten thousand seamen voted. Earls of Hallifax and Broke sworn Lord Lieute∣nants of Northamptonshire and Warwick∣shire.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Nov."/>Earl of Middlesex and Mr. Ralph were with me, to acquaint me that the printer and publisher of the Remembrancer was taken up for his paper of last Saturday the 18th instant, but that the messenger used them with uncommon civility, touch∣ed nothing of their papers, presses, or ef∣fects, and took their words for their sur∣rendering themselves the next morning. My Lord had been with the Prince, who agreed to indemnify them as to the ex∣pence, but was very averse, that any thing should be done to make him at all appear in it, which made them very uneasy.</P>
<P>At half past twelve I went to Carleton
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>
House, and in a quarter of an hour was called in. Sir Thomas Bootle was with the Prince. His Royal Highness took me into a window, told me that he had sent Middlesex to me, about the seizing the Printer, &amp;c. What was to be done? and then without giving me time to answer, he ran out into reasons why nobody that belonged to him must appear. I gently let him see that I thought other∣wise, and insinuated, whether, if Mr. Ralph should be taken up, it would not be pro∣per that Lord Middlesex and I should bail him: he said, by no means, and there∣fore Ralph should be spoken to, that he might keep out of the way, &amp;c. At last, he ordered that he should go to my house at Hammersmith, with which I agreed, thinking <HI>that</HI> the strongest mark of his protection that we could desire. After much talk about this and that, and some idle accounts about the poll at Covent Garden, he made me sit by him, and ran into a long discourse about the army, and then about the reduction of interest, and so let himself into a discourse about the necessity
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>
of saying something upon those things in Parliament, to feel pulse, and keep the party together, &amp;c. all which was designed as an apology (instead of finding fault) to me, for what had passed the beginning of the session—I took it up, upon his men∣tioning something about talk and throwing things out, to expose, &amp;c. and said that I supposed talk might be right, but people should consider what talk, and if they had any thing to say. That perpetually throwing out things, which one neither understood nor could prove, was, I thought, and always should think, exposing one's self, and not the persons aimed at—That 'twas for his service, to put little things into his power, to be verified beyond contradiction; that he might certainly know what dependance was to be had upon those they came from, when they inform∣ed him of greater matters. Therefore, I would furnish him with one instance; he had heard I was in a great passion about the Earl of Egmont's behaviour upon the Address: luckily for me, I had never spoken to any body about it, but to two
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>
persons, favourite servants of his Royal Highness, and particular friends of mine, Lords Middlesex; and Baltimore, who join∣ed us as we were talking of it very calmly; he seemed to be of our opinion, and said he had told Cotton we should not divide with them: I knew that Lord Middlesex had told him how it passed, and if he would give me leave to bring Lord Balti∣more to him, he would inform his Royal Highness that there was not the least heat among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny of us all. (I knew Baltimore was the author of this dirty piece of cun∣ning.) That by this, he might see, if he pleased, what credit was to be given for the future to those, who brought him this piece of intelligence. He thanked me, and was very gracious, and talked it off as well as he could, but in the multiplicity of discourse, owned to me that Baltimore had told him, but meant no harm, &amp;c. I replied, I had never seen business done in a meeting of a dozen, like that, on the 15th day, before the session: that those meetings were always declaratory, tho' in the shape of deliberation. That
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
the first concoction was always between the Prince and three or four persons at most: that I hoped to have laid my poor opinions before him in that manner, with two or three only; that I hoped to have found a friend there, especially Lord Mid∣dlesex, whom I thought, upon all ac∣counts, ought to be at the first digestion: that then we should properly lay our thoughts jointly before his Royal High∣ness, or, if we differed, could reason it out with one another, and he might judge which side to adhere to. But to combat the opinions he adopted, separately with him, was impossible: we could not, we ought not to dispute with him, as we did with each other.</P>
<P>He was a good deal staggered at what I said about Lord Middlesex, and said, he ought, no doubt, to be of the great meeting: I said, of both sure, and added something much in his favour. I then told him, that I found very little disposi∣tion to friendship and cordiality with me, in those whom he seemed principally to
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>
confide in, &amp;c. He said, I must not won∣der there was a little shyness at first, there was so many stories, &amp;c. &amp;c. I replied, that I hoped he did not think, I men∣tioned it by way of complaint, for if it were not with relation to his service, I should never think of desiring the favour and countenance of any one or of all of those gentlemen, as any sort of addition to me. That, as he thought it for his service, I already had done, tho' fruitlessly, and would continue to do every thing, and go all the way to obtain their good will: that I beg∣ged he would observe, that in consequence of his service and commands, I would chearfully do this, but, separate from his service and commands, it never could have entered into my imagination to have made court to those gentlemen, because I never could think, nor did I believe, any body else would, that those gentlemen any where, or at any time, could do me any honour by admitting me among them. He then said, that, to be sure, I was in a situation and upon a footing that I ought not to make court to any man in England;
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
nobody could expect it from me. Having extorted this confession, as a mark to re∣member this part of the conversation by, I left it there.</P>
<P>This is a short recapitulation of a conversation of full two hours: it con∣tains almost every word I said. His Roy∣al Highness talked all the rest of the time.</P>
<P>Lord Middlesex came to me after din∣ner, to whom I communicated the whole; he was much pleased at it, and thinks that all will go well in time. I think other∣wise, and that there is no prospect of do∣ing any good.</P>

objection to his conduct, thought him a good servant of the King's, and doubted not, but that he would serve him as well when he should be King. That as to the thing, his Royal Highness disliked the precedent; and, besides that, he had mea∣sures to keep, and might subject himself to the suspicion of having underhand dealings with the Court, by too easy compliances with requests of this nature, which was nothing less than giving away, by way of act of Parliament, so much of his inhe∣ritance. That therefore he desired a little time, and Mr. Walpole should have his final answer before the term for bringing in private bills expired. Mr. Walpole confessed the fact to be as the Prince had stated it, and assured me, that he had no thoughts of attempting it, if his Royal Highness refused his consent: that Mr. Pelham was against it on that account, but, importuned by him, declared that he could not refuse his father's son, but ne∣ver would be for another, of the same sort, and should move the King even in this, with much reluctance.

<P>Lord Middlesex, by the Prince's or∣der,<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Feb."/> shewed me a motion to be made the next day, for an account of the state of the port of Dunkirk, and the papers that had passed on that subject. It was agreed, that I should wait on the Prince the next day.</P>
<P>I waited upon his Royal Highness and<MILESTONE N="5." UNIT="Feb."/> told him that I was come to thank him for communicating the motion to me, which was more than any of my fellow servants had condescended to do, since I came into his service. He made me a very embar∣rassed and perplexed answer. I then pro∣ceeded to say, that I had not been idle, but had been looking into several things, in order to form something proper to be laid before Parliament. That I had, long, had this particular point of Dunkirk un∣der consideration: was determined to be at the expence to know, and to procure evidence of the present state of it, but my
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
acquaintance lay so much out of the mer∣cantile way, that I was at a loss how to go about it; that I had pitched upon Mr. Sheriff Jansen, being a trader himself, and much conversant in trade, as a proper per∣son to inform and assist me: that the great fit of sickness he fell into had, till now, disabled him from going out, and that yesterday was the first time I could get him to dinner. That I supposed, that, tho' I was so unfortunate as not to be rea∣dy, his Royal Highness was well inform∣ed of all things necessary to make out the charge, &amp;c. He said, no; but the throw∣ing it out, would make the Ministry feel they had <HI>la corde au col</HI>, and it was an op∣portunity to abuse them, &amp;c. I said that my idea had been, to bring something of national weight, which I could fix by un∣deniable evidence upon them, and leave it there. That if I could have brought this af∣fair up to that point, then I had designed to lay it before his Royal Highness, with this only remark, how far he thought proper to venture the consequences with France, in the present condition of this country.
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
He said, the Tories wanted something to be done, and if he did not do something, they immediately thought he was nego∣ciating. I told him also, that I had been, for some time, getting such lights as I could into the affair of Nova Scotia, that I designed to lay it before him, when I had brought it to be worthy of his con∣sideration; but it was my misfortune to think, that it was necessary to be armed with full proofs and conviction of every sort of the charge, before we brought it into the House. Upon that foot I sub∣mitted, that, in case upon this question of Dunkirk, it should come out, that the port was left just in the same condition it remained, under the treaty of Utrecht, without any innovation since the war, (the Ministry not having already enforced a stricter execution of that treaty, than ever had been enforced) it would not, I feared, make a very strong point against them. He was pleased to say, No, to be sure, so long an acquiescence would great∣ly diminish the objection. Upon these words I left him, and went directly to the
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
House. In the debate, I argued against the inexpediency and dangers, (which were the objections, set up by the Court, to granting these papers) that there could be <HI>none</HI>, because if it appeared that there had been no innovations since the war, and that the post was in the state it had remained under the treaty of Utrecht— though I did not give it up, but still did insist we had a right to a fuller execution of that treaty confirmed by this, and there∣fore I did not give it up. Yet, if that appeared to be the case, no danger or inconveniency could arise from the mo∣tion, because I was sure that I, for one, would not, and I believed that no gentle∣man, upon that account, would move any thing, that might occasion a rupture with France.</P>
<P>At the end of the debate, Lord Egmont, who made the motion, recapitulated what had been said against it. He began, by going out of his way, to say, that he must first declare, that he was sorry to differ with me, but did not agree, that it would
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>
be sufficient to excuse the Ministry; if it should appear, as I had stated it, that things remained at Dunkirk, as they were left before the war, &amp;c. &amp;c. I was much surprised at this, considering the ex∣pressions of his Royal Highness a few hours before. We were beat by a very great majority. This night was published the vilest and most rancorous pamphlet against me, that, I believe, any age or country can shew; the author of it taking, by implication, the character of being in the Prince's service.</P>
<P>Went to Lord Middlesex with the<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Feb."/> words (as near as I could recollect) writ∣ten down, which I had used in the debate, and which he had heard. He agreed to them: I then desired him to lay them before the Prince (who was at Kew and was to come to see Lady Middlesex on her miscarriage) and in my name to complain, both of the pamphlet, and of the behaviour I met with—which he undertook. Mr. Ralph and Dr. Sharp came after dinner, much conversation about the pamphlet,
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>
which Lord Middlesex told me in the morning, the Prince had told Lady Mid∣dlesex (before he went to Kew) was sent him in a letter on Friday night: that he was much incensed at it; that he had immediately sent to Mr. Nugent, exami∣ned him upon it, and he had absolutely denied it with detestation and abhorrence: that he had questioned the Earl of Egmont upon it, who had done the same. Mr. Furnese came, who had had a conversation with Lord Baltimore of his (Lord Balti∣more's) own seeking when in wine, and renewed when sober; in which that Lord declared, that there was a combination of the whole family against me; that they were, as he said, in a round Robin: tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I endeavoured to govern and supplan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, that they talked of me with the utmost inveteracy: that <HI>he</HI> was my friend but, however, he would keep his connec∣tions, &amp;c. We sent Dr. Sharp home, to stay till the Prince went away: who re∣turned and brought us that very account <HI>which by mistake</HI> I have set down before, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given to me by Lord Middlesex in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
morning; who then informed me that the Prince had had the pamphlet sent him in a letter, the Friday before and was much incensed at it. Lord Middlesex agreed, I should see the Prince as soon as might be, after I had seen him in the morning. The Prince, as well as we, suspected that the pamphlet might come from the Court, in order to foment and increase divisions.</P>
<P>Went to Leicester House, after Lord<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Feb."/> Middlesex had been with me, who con∣firmed last night's account, with the ad∣dition that Lord Egmont offered his en∣deavours to find out the Author, &amp;c. &amp;c. that the Prince was sorry for what had happened in the House, but as Lord Eg∣mont had differed from me with civility, he did not seem to lay much stress upon it. It being late and publick day, I sent in a note to the Prince, to know when he would honour me with an hour's conver∣sation—he appointed me the next day, at seven o'clock, at Carleton House. Mr. Herbert presented as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="52"/>Saw Mr Ralph, and Mr. Furnese, asked <MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Feb."/>the latter, if in charging the combination of the family against me, I might put i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in proof, from the conversation betwe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him and Lord Baltimore, but I could no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persuade him to assent to it. I sent Mr. Ralph to Lord Middlesex, to know if I might take notice to the Prince, of a cir∣cumstance which he told me yesterday morning, and <HI>which I have omitted</HI>, which was, that the Prince had dropped, that Lord Baltimore had had a conversation with Mr. Furnese, who was very warm. He sent me word, that he thought it would be improper. At six o'clock the Prince sent me word, that he was just re∣turned from Kew, and found that the Princess had appointed Comte Flemming and his Lady to be at Carleton House at seven, and therefore feared he should not have time to dine and see me; but desired I would come the next day at seven.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> Just upon one o'clock this day, two very great and very distinct shocks of
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
an earthquake were felt in Pall Mall, at the distance of some seconds.</P>
<P>Went to the house: Mr. Edward Wal∣pole's<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Feb."/> Bill passed without opposition. Af∣ter dinner went to Carleton House; just as I came thither, I was followed in by Dr. Lee, who brought old Coram with pro∣positions for a vagabond hospital. I was told that the Prince had asked for me se∣veral times: I was immediately called in: I told the Prince, that Dr. Lee was in the house, and that I did not wish to make him wait: he pretended, that he had for∣got he had been long appointed, to bring Coram on that day, but that he would go out to him, and that they were to go up to the Princess. I saw that his Royal High∣ness had sent for him on purpose, and therefore said, that I had nothing to say to him, but what I should be glad that Dr. Lee should hear. He went out to them, and after a short stay sent them up. He returned and began to talk about the earthquake, which conversation I continued a little, when I asked, if the Doctor was
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>
to come down—he said, yes. When the Doctor came, I suffered the discourse to continue general, to see if he meant only, to give the Doctor the opportunity of making a civil visit. But, at last, his Royal High∣ness applying to me, said, he thought I had something to say to him: this, by the Doctor's not moving, made it plain; and therefore I began by saying, that I should not have presumed to ask that favour, yet it was a very particular pleasure to me, that he was so good as to admit Dr. Lee to be present, and to hear what I had to lay before his Royal Highness. That I must, in the first place, return my most humble thanks for the indignation he had expressed against the vile and rancorous pamphlet, which had been published against me, &amp;c. He said that, as soon as it was sent to him, he saw that it was designed to personate Mr. Nugent—that he immediately sent for him, who denied every part of it with the utmost abhorrence—that Lord Eg∣mont did the same, &amp;c.—just as Lord Middlesex related. I replied, that I had never thought so basely of either of them
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
as to suspect them: that if I had been so injurious to either, yet, after so solemn a denial before the highest tribunal, their master, their Prince, near being their King, every trace, or thought of such a suspicion must be for ever entirely laid out of the question: but that it was evident that the character assumed, was of one of the family. Dr. Lee said, he had never heard of it, till last Wednesday, and, as he detested all things of that nature, had not yet seen it, and believed, he never should. The Prince said, every body was infa∣mously abused: he and his father had been often so; that it would do me no hurt, &amp;c. I told him that I was very unfortu∣nate, if I explained myself so ill, as to be thought to complain of the pamphlet fur∣ther than as it injured his service; that I had hitherto, I thought, mentioned it, only as a ground to return him my most hum∣ble thanks for his generous interposition, without being applied to: but that I now beg'd to make another plain and evident use of it.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="56"/>That though it was now beyond ques∣tion, that this libel did not proceed from any of his family, yet, it was as much be∣yond question, that the behaviour of many of his family had given the author ground to suppose, that the assumed character might pass for the real one, and that it was evidently meant, to fix the charge of my intrusion into the family, and their detes∣tation of me, to create differences, if there were none, and to publish and inflame them, if there were. That to this fact, thus plainly proved by the pamphlet, I would add another, which I thought very unfortunate to myself. That I knew how disagreeable it was, to bring gentlemen head to head, and that I foresaw, his Roy∣al Highness would not like to admit it. But that I could prove (though now I chose to do it by reason only, and colla∣teral facts) that there was, I did not know what to call it, an opinion, a resolution among the gentlemen his servants and fol∣lowers (excepting Dr. Lee, whom they nominally excepted) to look upon me as an improper and unprofitable servant, and
<PB N="45" REF="57"/>
would not unite or communicate with me. That I knew this to be true, and looked upon it as a great misfortune to me, be∣cause, though it did not become me to say before his Royal Highness how I came into his family, yet, I certainly embraced, with the utmost pleasure, the opportunity of belonging, as a servant, to a Prince, whom of all mankind I should have wished to have passed my life with, if his misfor∣tune and the misfortune of the public had placed him in a private station. That the disappointment of so flattering a view was the more sensible, because I was sure, it must arise from some fault, and that no small fault; because, after what had so lately passed at the other end of the Mall (St. James's) and the lively sense his Royal Highness had expressed of it, I could not, and did not imagine, that any man, or body of men would be hardy enough to combine, to prescribe to him whom he should employ, to what degree, or in what manner. This, as I knew it would, fired him, and though till this, he had kept the most profound silence, he now inter∣rupted
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>
me, and said, nobody should pre∣tend to do that by him; that he allowed, sometimes, one, and sometimes, another to lay their opinions before him, but no∣body presumed to direct him, and appealed to Dr. Lee, if any one treated him in that manner, &amp;c. &amp;c. I replied that I had said so, and understood it so, and that made this treatment the more sensible, because I was sure it must proceed from some fault of mine, which I beg'd to be acquainted with, for it plainly appeared that the dis∣like to me was real.</P>
<P>That I must now proceed to another thing, which, I once thought, a most cer∣tain fact, but which I had since found was grounded on a mistake; that I was about to say, that his Royal Highness a little contributed to lead me into that mis∣take, by telling me, when he was most graciously pleased to command my services, that all his family, as well as himself, were desirous of it. That I had heard the same, indeed, on all hands, and some of the most considerable had themselves, long, often,
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
and with great zeal assured me of their warmest desires, and had even taken cre∣dit to themselves, for having earnestly pressed his Royal Highness to call me to that honour, which they now thought me so unworthy of. That, therefore, I beg'd they might be asked, fairly and openly, what was the reason of so total an altera∣tion, as well as so sudden an one: for I had thought, that I perceived a difference, even before we came to town, the last time, from Cliefden. That, as to arro∣gance and sufficiency, and design to govern his Royal Highness and them, which I supposed, had been plentifully inculcated; I beg'd (and I was glad to do it before the Doctor) he would be pleased to declare first as to himself, if I had fatigued him with audiences, or had laid hold of the many other opportunities I had, to obtrude my own thoughts upon him, or to know his; to complain to him, that he did not communicate what he was doing to me, and take my opinions, or to presume to expostulate with him, or blame what he had done for not communicating with me.
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
He said, No indeed, but twice, as he re∣membered—once, was about a paper I had drawn to lay before him, and the other time, when the printer of the Remem∣brancer was taken up. I put him in mind, that, at that time, I mentioned to him the alteration I observed in his servants, which was so long ago as last November. I then asked if, in the many leisure hours of pri∣vate life, I had ever spoken ill of any one of them, or so much as complained, or endeavoured to lessen or depreciate them or their performances. He said, No: but to be sure I did not express any partiality to schemes which I did not approve of— (but he did not answer so fully and fairly upon this head, as the truth is) I then said, I would not desire his Royal High∣ness to declare, if those gentlemen had treated me with the same fairness—as I was sure he would answer that to himself. As to the governing them, did I ever in∣terfere with them? They formed their own business, their papers, their own mo∣tions, without the least communication with, or complaint from me: that I was
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
sorry for it, as they made me a useless ser∣vant to him in Parliament; for that it was impossible for me to go thither, and follow their motions at sight and at hearing, and then to be disowned for my pains. He laughed, and said, it was because they had nothing to communicate; they had done nothing that he knew of. The mutiny bill was an agreed point by all, and they had had nothing else. That as to the Dunkirk motion, he protested it was a thought of his own, that Dr. Lee knew nothing of it, even when he sent it to me by Lord Middlesex. I replied, that, in a conversation, the grounds of which were my misfortune in being rendered useless to a master, whose unmerited goodness and favour, were my sole ambition and re∣liance, it was impossible that I could change them so grossly, as to be brought to complain, or to suffer him for a single moment to think, that I did complain of him. That I received the communication he had honoured me with, as a mark of his favour, with much respect: that what I spoke of was the non-communication,
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>
and disavowal of the rest of his servants, both in the mutiny bill and on another occasion. He said, that as to punishing mutiny with death, he must own to me that he, as well as they, differed from me, and had accordingly acted last year: and that Lords Carlisle and Bathurst had dif∣fered with Lord Bath upon that clause; for which he appealed to Dr. Lee, who said he was confined by illness (as was I) from coming to the House. As to what happened upon the motion, he was sorry for it, but thought it was of no great im∣portance. I said, with some warmth, that I thought it was of the highest importance to him: was it to pass for his sense, was <HI>he</HI> to appear in the light of declaring, that he would, if he were now King, or would force his father to, begin a new broil with France, at this time, in these circumstan∣ces of this country, because fifteen months after such a war ended by such a peace, France had not carried the demolition of Dunkirk, farther than it had been carried for thirty-two years last past? Was this a point to be maintained? Was it
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>
a doctrine fit for him to appear as the pro∣moter of? I thought it was not, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mprudent, it could not be supported, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, above all, most prejudicial to his ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice, to have it thought he gave ear to such rash councils: besides, that his Royal Highness had agreed with me, the last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing he said to me that very morning, that in the above-mentioned case, if it came out only so, the long acquiescence much lessened, if it did not take away the objection. I beg'd pardon for being warm about the consequence of the doctrine, be∣cause that was not the use I intended to make of it; what I meant to establish by it, was, to prove a settled resolution in his family, that they would have nothing to do with me, for when Mr. Pitt, who answered Lord Egmont, came to that part, he pressed his argument thus: "If it should come out, that there is no innova∣tion, as I verily believe, the truth is, and that it is, as it was left by the treaty of Utrecht, explained in 1717, will any man say that it is a crime in the Ministry, or a reason to quarrel with France? will
<PB N="52" REF="64"/>
any gentleman say it? does any one say it?" To this his Lordship made no reply in affirmation of what he had laid down i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contradiction to me, which proves to a demonstration, that he went out of his way, in concert with those in conjunction with him, to shew the world by a publick disavowal, that they disclaimed all concert and connection with me: whether that was for <HI>his</HI> service, he best knew. I beg'd to be understood, that, in all I had said, my concern was only in relation to his service; if he was satisfied, I was. I de∣sired to govern nobody, to supplant nobo∣dy: but that I could not follow his fami∣ly in public, in whatever they pleased to start; that in things I was not consulted about, where my advice and opinion was neither taken, nor even asked, I could not go down and appear to approve and sup∣port: that I was sorry it rendered my ser∣vices useless to him in the House of Com∣mons, but I could not put myself upon that footing: he said, to be sure it was not to be expected from me, or to that effect. I replied, that it was very well; I
<PB N="53" REF="65"/>
was perfectly satisfied, if he was. I then began to put him in mind, that I had not been idle; that I had thought both of the point of Dunkirk, and of Nova Scotia; and had looked into several things, that might be introductive to the publick ac∣counts; and had, above a month ago, hinted something of it to Dr. Lee, and told him, that I hoped for his assistance. [This the Doctor readily confirmed.] That it might go far, and affect several families; whether his Royal Highness would care to go so far, he would be the best judge. That when I had thought upon any point, in which I could see day-light; after I had digested it a little, I chose to lay it before a friend or two in the first place; if then we liked it, and could give it a body, we should then lay it before his Royal Highness for his approbation: if it met with that, then, and not till then, I should think of communicating it to those, who were chiefly to assist in the execution of it. That this might be go∣verning, for ought I knew; but that this was the way of doing business which I had
<PB N="54" REF="66"/>
learnt, and indeed, that I had never known any other practised.</P>
<P>They both laughed and said, to be sure it was not governing, and was the only way of transacting business. I replied, it was the only way I knew, and it might be governing; but if it was, his Royal Highness would please to observe, that I had not done even that, yet. I then ob∣served to him, how extremely hard it was for a minority, to bring any considerable, national abuse, into absolute, undeniable proof, all the offices and documents being in the hands of the court; and I desired him to look back through all the opposi∣tions for forty years past, saying, that I could recollect but one, that was brought home and fixed upon the ministry, which was this very point of Dunkirk: and this his Royal Highness readily agreed to.</P>
<P>This, to the best of my memory, was the most, if not all the material part that passed. The conversation became general for a time, and then his Royal Highness
<PB N="55" REF="67"/>
called for a chair, and left Dr. Lee and me together.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I told the Doctor that I knew there was a combination against me, that I could prove it, and they knew I could prove it: but that, since I had had an opportunity of explaining myself fully to his Royal Highness, in the presence of so good a witness as himself, I was entire∣ly indifferent as to the event. The Doctor assured me, in a seeming friendly, and warm manner, that he should always be glad to act with me, in every thing that might be for the service of the Prince, and the utili∣ty of the country. I thanked him pro∣perly, and desired him to remember, that I had desired, and even insisted with, the Prince, to declare if ever, or at any time, or in what, I had ever attempted to govern him, or complained, that I did not; adding, that possibly I might have had such an idea, might have attempted it, might have miscarried, and been reprimanded for it, and might have grown wiser: but if I had done it at all, I should scarcely have chal∣lenged
<PB N="56" REF="68"/>
the Prince, before him, to declare it. The next thing I beg'd him to re∣member was, that I had fully apprized the Prince, that, in what I was not con∣sulted about and advised with, I would have nothing to do with in Parliament, and that I would not go down thither upon that footing, and so we parted.</P>
<P>I desired Mr. Ralph, whom I found at my house, to go to Mr. Furneses imme∣diately, and from thence send to Lord Middlesex for leave to wait upon him with an account of this whole transaction.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Feb."/>I saw Lord Middlesex for a moment be∣fore I went to court. He told me that the Prince came to his house directly from me on Friday night. That he was very thoughtful, and endeavoured to shake it off, but could not; so that any one might see, that something lay heavy upon his mind, which he could not get quit of. That Mr. Ralph had acquainted him with what had passed, and that, last night, the Prince and Princess came to Lady Middle∣sex,
<PB N="57" REF="69"/>
who had not been out since her mis∣carriage, and staid late. That, then, it came all out. That according to Mr. Ralph's relation, the Prince said but little: but according to his own, his Royal High∣ness made himself a great speaker. That he had convinced me about the mutiny bill. That I mentioned a combination to govern him, but that nobody durst enter into such a combination. That I did not say there was such a thing, or he would not have suffered me to go on: and then, what he would do to those, who should presume to enter into such a thing!—in short, he seemed to laugh it off, and that, now all things would go well again, &amp;c. But he again mentioned the conversation between Mr. Furnese and Lord Baltimore of last Tuesday. Lord Baltimore contrived to see him, as soon as he came from Kew, and before he went to Lord Middlesex's, and represented that conversation, as pressed upon him by Mr. Furnese, at my request, and that he had talked very high of me, if not from me; and that I complained that he (his Royal Highness) beg'd and pressed
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>
me to come into his service, for that he could not do without me, &amp;c. &amp;c. I asked, if I might make use of this overture to have the matter explained. He said, he was afraid not, it being said in confidence. I then asked, that in case Mr. Furnese would tell him the whole conversation, if he would relate it to the Prince fully and fairly, and fix the lye where it belonged. He said, he could do that very well, by telling the Prince, that he was much surprised, when he first heard him men∣tion that conversation, but more so, to find that he mentioned it again; and therefore had contrived, in talking toge∣ther, to draw out of Mr. Furnese, the particular account of it, which he would tell him literally, and beg, that, for his farther satisfaction, he would send for Mr. Furnese to give him an account of it, who, he was sure, was a man of honour, and would tell him the whole truth. I went to Leicester House, and was very well re∣ceived. Sent to Mr. Furnese to see him to-morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="71"/>Mr. Furnese came: I read to him what passed on Friday, and told him what Lord<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Feb."/> Middlesex had heard from the Prince again, about the turn which Lord Baltimore had given to the conversation between them; which he again declared to be most false, and that he was ready to declare it to the Prince, if his Royal Highness was pleased to send for him. Intelligence from H. V. of the very great dissensions between the ministers.</P>
<P>Saw Lord Middlesex. We agreed that<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Feb."/> he should (as indeed it was hardly to be avoided) take up this matter again with the Prince, and tell him that I had given him an account of it. That I was most grateful for his grace and condescension, in giving me so full and patient an au∣dience—that, I hoped, I had not behaved improperly. That upon the whole, though he was my friend, yet he thought the Prince should, for his future quiet, go to the bottom of this affair. Every one had their faults—I might be vain—I might be high—and yet mean very well, and be made
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>
very useful. He did not mean to push things to extremities. If I had pressed indecently upon his Royal Highness, or into his affairs, where I was not called. Though it was true, that I had not in∣truded into his family, yet, if I had talked impertinently and vainly about it, of being begged and prayed, and that his Royal High∣ness could not do without me—why, it was no heinous fault, but he thought I should be gently made to feel the impro∣priety of such a behaviour, by a word from his Royal Highness, or from him in his name. But it imported his Highness to be sure the charge was true, and to give me an opportunity of justifying myself; otherwise, the party was not equal, his Royal Highness having heard but one side. If, on the contrary, it should turn out false, was it not highly necessary, that he should know, what sort of people he had about him? That conversation, for in∣stance, which his Royal Highness had twice mentioned, and of which he had great doubts in his mind, was not justly represented to his Royal Highness, would
<PB N="61" REF="73"/>
his Royal Highness give him leave to tell me of it, that I might go to the bottom of it? or (what would be better) would he send for Mr. Furnese, and let him give a full account of it, without ever men∣tioning to any body, that he had been questioned by his Royal Highness. This the Prince might keep in his own breast, and not let it go any farther. His (Lord Middlesex's) intention not being to go to any extremity, but only that his Royal High∣ness might know the persons he employed; and not reject any one for a few faults, that might be useful in many things; nor trust, without reserve, any person, who, though useful in some things, and fit to be employed, may be dangerous in others, and should cautiously be guarded against. That he should tell his Royal Highness that I complained, that after having sat down quiet under a falsehood which Lord Egmont laid to my charge, of telling Cary what passed between his Royal High∣ness and me, at Kew, when he took me into his service (which I could prove, even by Cary himself, who was told it by Lord
<PB N="62" REF="74"/>
Egmont)—after having acquiesced so long under that imputation, rather than hurt that Lord, or occasion any, the least dis∣quiet, in the family, that I did not expect such a return. These points, Lord Mid∣dlesex agrees, are right, and he will un∣dertake them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Feb."/>At Leicester House, but went away be∣fore the Princess came out. After dinner, I went to see Dr. Lee, who received me with much apparent openness. We talked much about what the Prince's conduct ought to be, in case, under their present undoubted quarrels and disunion, either part of the Administration should apply to him for assistance. The conversation was begun by him, and we, both, agreed that, unless they would restore the King to his family by a thorough reconciliation, and to his People, by some popular acts, the Prince should not engage with any of them. And we neither thought them honest or able enough to bring about such great events, and we agreed in wishing that no such application should be made</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="75"/>Mr. Henley was with me, who did not think Mr. Lascelles's Privy Seal sufficient<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Feb."/> for a separate point: he asked me how things went; I told him, but indifferently. That I had no communication with the other gentlemen in our family, and that they were united against me—he treated them very slightly, and said that indeed he had had offers enough to be of their meet∣ings, but had declined them, not thinking himself <HI>little</HI> enough to follow any body there—that they generally shewed him their motions either in the house or else∣where. I said, even that did not happen to me; that, therefore, I was determined not to meddle with any thing, where my opinion was neither asked nor taken. That if the Prince liked their method of proceeding, I was perfectly satisfied: but I would not put myself upon that foot in publick. That I would do every thing in my power, spare no expence, no complai∣sance, nor chearful concurrence in all his pleasures, to make myself an agreeable ser∣vant, as long as I had the honour to be∣long to him; but that, in his publick
<PB N="64" REF="76"/>
business I would never intrude myself; and that it was impossible for me to follow those gentlemen, though I did not, in the least, desire to govern them: This, as well as I can remember, was all material that I said. He said much more of them, blaming them without reserve for their self-sufficiency, &amp;c. that they were in∣formed of nothing at bottom, but dealt only in invectives, and that, not very well: perpetual imputation and suspicion, with∣out being able to make out any thing, which would, if encouraged, make all government impracticable. He was dis∣pleased with Dr. Lee, for not telling him, that he was to have the seals, as our Chan∣cellor, if Sir T. Bootle had died. Said that Lord Baltimore forced him to ask the Prince for them, who told him that he most sincerely wished to oblige him, but that he had promised Dr. Lee, in case of accidents, to give him the seals, and that Lord Baltimore was present, when the promise was made—which usage he took very ill (and I think justly) of Baltimore, who, when he pressed him to ask for the
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>
seals, had assured him that he knew the Prince would gladly grant them to him—with much more of this sort. I went to Leicester House, where was Mr. Henley. Lord Egmont came and imme∣diately took Mr. Henley into a private room, where they had a conversation of near an hour. This surprised me much. In the afternoon I met their Royal High∣nesses by order at Lady Middlesex's, where came Madame de Munchausen and Mr. Breton: we went in our own coaches to a fortune-teller's who was young Des Noyers, disguised and instructed to sur∣prise Madame de Munchausen, which he effectually did. I had some talk with Lady Middlesex, who was very dejected and full of complaints at the encouragement the party met with, that was united against us. From the fortune-teller's we went to supper at Carleton House.</P>
<P>Lords Bute, Inchiquin, and Bathurst,<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Feb."/> Messrs. Masham, Breton, and I, followed their Royal Highnesses, Ladies Middlesex
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
and Howe, to dinner at Kew. Mr. Blud∣worth was with us.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Feb."/>Worked in the new walk at Kew.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Feb."/>All of us, men, women, and children, worked at the same place—a cold dinner.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="March"/>Went to meet Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Middlesex, and Mr. Furnese, at Mr. Ralph's: we went through several points of business, and determined to pro∣ceed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="March"/>The election for the county of Middle∣sex. Sir Francis Dashwood, Messrs.

From thence to Brentford Butts, which was the place of poll. It began
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
about one, I polled early and got to my coach, which was so wedged in, that after much delay, I found it impossible to make use of it; so that Mr. Breton and I were forced to take two of my servants' horses, with livery housings, and ride, without boots, ten miles to Lord Middle∣sex's at Walton, to meet their Royal High∣nesses at dinner. We got thither by five o'clock, and found them attended by Lord Inchiquin and Mr. Bludworth in the park. Dined at six. My coach did not arrive till nine. We all came away between ten and eleven—arrived in town about one. Poll for Mr. Cooke 1617—for Mr. Hony∣wood 1201. We carried it by 416.</P>
<P>Went to the House, where it was agreed<MILESTONE N="9."

<P>I had much talk with Lady Middlesex,<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="March"/>
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
and we agreed in opinion as to the disa∣greeableness and impropriety of our situa∣tion, but that we must go on this summer, as well as we can. Lord Bolingbroke died this morning.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1750."/>Council at St. James's—King present— <MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="April"/>Regency named—We all kissed hands and took leave.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="April"/>Went to the House of Lords. The King spoke, and prorogued the Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="April"/>The King went to Harwich. The wind changed to N. E.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="April"/>Mr. Drax, who was ill of the gout, sent to desire to speak to me. I went, and he told me, that petitions had been obtained from the miners in Cornwall, for the holding a tin parliament. That they were referred to the Prince's privy council, who had rejected them, under a persuasion that there was a job at bottom. That the Prince was so far in it, that, notwithstanding the disapprobation of his council, he had or∣dered
<PB N="69" REF="81"/>
a privy seal to be made out, to the Lord Warden of the Stanneries, to call and hold a parliament on or before the second of November.</P>
<P>That the nature of the Prince's revenue upon tin, was as follows—All tin, which is raised throughout the Dutchy of Corn∣wall, must be brought to the Prince's smelting-house, and when smelted, pays four shillings for every hundred weight, (which is 120<HI>l.</HI>) Then, when made into pigs, it goes to the coinage, which is only a stamp, with the Prince's arms; and then, and not before, is marketable.</P>
<P>Besides this duty of four shillings <HI>per</HI> hundred weight throughout the dutchy, no tin can be disposed of, till the Duke has taken the quantity he pleases. This is called the preemption. This preemption has never been exercised by Princes, and seldom leased out. Once it was under∣taken by Queen Anne, and Lord Treasurer Godolphin, and Mr. Boscawen (afterward Viscount Falmouth) on the other part:
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
by which, for the present exigence, the crown got the power in several boroughs, though they lost by the undertaking, which was occasioned by the war. This lease was again renewed by the succeeding ad∣ministration, but I believe, it was not car∣ried into execution. The lease must be granted by an act of the parliament of the tinners, which parliament is called and held, by a privy seal to the lord warden for that purpose.</P>
<P>The dutchy is divided into four districts, each of which sends six members. The voters must be freeholders. They chuse a speaker, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The quantity of tin raised annually, at an average of many years past, is 2200 tuns: the market price to the exporter from 4<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI> to 4<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> per hundred weight; so that the Prince's revenue upon that head, amounts to about 8800<HI>l. per ann.</HI> clear of all deductions, as there are other small duties that defray the charge of officers, collection, &amp;c. N. B. The consumption
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
is much less, and the freight dearer in time of war, but then, as the commodity is necessary, the vent is proportionably in∣creased, the first years of peace.</P>
<P>Last year, the two companies of mine adventurers, and mine battery, both peti∣tioned the Prince for the lease of this pre∣emption, the petitions were referred to his privy council and rejected. They offered his Royal Highness an advance on his re∣venue of 1200<HI>l. per ann.</HI> and a loan of 10,000<HI>l.</HI> at 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> without insuring his life, which he is obliged to do, at 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> additional, on all he borrows.</P>
<P>This not succeeding, a petition has late∣ly been obtained from the tinners, pray∣ing for a parliament, which was, as I have said, rejected by the council, who supposed it was meant to procure a lease, for the advantage of those, who were at the bottom of the former offers, which were so very disproportionate, that nothing but gross imposition could be expected from that quarter. The persons concerned,
<PB N="72" REF="84"/>
were supposed, by Mr. Drax, to be Mr. Thomas Pitt and Dr. Ayscough.</P>
<P>To shew the impropriety of the pro∣ceeding, and the danger of the job, Mr. Drax observed that this parliament, though it could do no act without the Prince's assent, yet it might come to several resolu∣tions, which might be disagreeable to sub∣mit to, and yet inconvenient to break through. He then proceeded to state the advantages of the lease of preemption, which, from what he apprehends, the Prince is not properly apprized of.</P>
<P>The offer, last year, he stated at an ad∣vance of 1700<HI>l. per ann.</HI>—1200<HI>l.</HI> annually, and the loan of 10,000<HI>l.</HI> at 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> at 500<HI>l. per ann.</HI> because the Prince must pay 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> additional elsewhere, for in∣suring his life.</P>
<LIST>
<LABEL>He said, that he is well assured, that the tinners are ready to agree, and contractors to engage to take all the tin that shall be coined at 3<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s. per</HI> hundred weight, and to avoid the clamour of a monopoly, they
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
will oblige themselves to sell it at 4<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI> which is below the market price. The gross gain, then, of 1<HI>l. per</HI> hundred weight, upon 2200 tons, is, <HI>per ann.</HI></LABEL>

<P>These calculations, he said, were right: he does not know what is at the bottom of this, nor what offers have or will be made; but by what is passed, he is very suspicious, and earnestly desired me to dis∣suade his Royal Highness, if possible, from it; though he knew it would be very dif∣ficult, because he was sure, they lured him to it by shewing to him new acquisitions in the Cornish elections.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="86"/>We went to Kew for the whole week. <MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="April"/>Their Royal Highnesses, Ladies Middle∣sex and Howe; Lords Bute and Inchiquin; Messrs. Masham, Breton, and I. We had plays acted every evening.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="May"/>About eleven o'clock, the Prince sent to me to come to Leicester House as soon as I could. I arrived there in half an an hour's time. I found the groom in waiting, and the bishop of Oxford. The Prince soon joined us, and said that the Princess had been ill since three in the morning: by this time the Duke of Chan∣dois, and Lords Egmont and North, Messrs. Cust and Breton were come. We went into the bed-chamber at three quar∣ters after eleven. The grooms withdrew. We found in the bed-chamber Ladies Mid∣dlesex, Berkley, Irwin and Howe; Lady Bailey, Mrs. Cornwall and Payne. The midwife upon the bed with the Princess, and Dr. Wilmot standing by.</P>
<P>Just at half past twelve, she was delivered of a Prince, without once complaining or groaning the whole time. Then the Prince,
<PB N="75" REF="87"/>
the Ladies, and some of us sat down to breakfast in the next room—then went to prayers below stairs. The Prince wrote to the King, and the Duke of Bedford came for the letter. A numerous drawing-room, where appeared all the ministers and persons in the chief employments. The ministers were not sent for to the labour. The Prince put off the publick dinner and servants in waiting, and ordered me to dine with him in private at Carleton House.</P>
<P>The Prince's publick table (which lasts<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="May"/> about ten days on account of the Princess's lying in) began on Monday.</P>
<P>I went to town, and spent three hours<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="May"/> in examining the tin affair, which appears to be a scandalous job, and I am deter∣mined to go to the bottom of it. Waited on the Duke of Dorset about Prince Henry's bathing in the sea, at Walmer Castle.</P>
<P>I settled with the Duke of Dorset, that<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="May"/>
<PB N="76" REF="88"/>
Prince Henry should not go to Walmer, as it was a garrison, and as the King's leave was to be asked.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="June"/>Messrs. Kelsal and Lovel came to me. Lovel says that the miner brings, what is called, black tin to the Smelting House, and delivers it by weight, and receives so much white tin at the coinage (which is quarterly) and takes a tin bill for it (if he is poor) as the bill is marketable. He pro∣mised to inform himself farther.</P>

<P>Lord Middlesex and Mr. Drake were<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="June"/> with me; we had much talk about the Prince's tin, and the scandalous transac∣tion about it, which was encouraged by some of his servants. Drake thinks a vast
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
profit may arise from farming it, both to the Prince and to the farmer, who would give him 200,000<HI>l.</HI> by way of fine. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think little or nothing can be given or got▪ but to get rid of Drake, and please Lord Middlesex, who seemed to lean a little towards him, I left it thus—That if any creditable man, or body of men, would take the best lease the Prince can give of his tin, reserving to his Royal Highness his four shillings <HI>per</HI> hundred weight (120<HI>l.</HI>) to be raised and collected with the same dignity and royal prerogative, as it now is: oblige themselves to pay to the miner, or owner, 3<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s. per</HI> 100, at 112 weight: bind themselves never to raise the price of tin above three shillings <HI>per</HI> 112 weight, higher than the market price shall be at the time of signing the lease: and to deliver all that is raised, at or be∣low that price. If for a seven years lease, containing these conditions, they will pay to his Royal Highness, by way of fine, 100,000<HI>l.</HI> sterling, without any reprises or deduction, he will make them such a lease,
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
as shall be a sufficient security for them to undertake the farm upon.</P>
<P>Went to Leicester House. Lord Mayor<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="June"/> and Aldermen came to compliment the Princess upon her lying-in. Letters from Hanover, with orders that those Knights of the Garter, who did not walk, should chuse their own proxies. The Prince de∣signs Lords Inchiquin for Prince George's proxy.</P>
<P>I met Mr. Vanneck, jun. by appoint∣ment<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="June"/> at Lord Middlesex's, about the Prince's tin. We had two hours conver∣sation, the result of which is among my papers relating to that matter. But, upon the whole, if he was to take all that is raised, with a liberty to advance the price 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> he could give no more than 66<HI>s. per</HI> hundred weight; so that suppo∣sing the tinners would be contented to bind themselves to the present market price of 64<HI>s.</HI> (which, I think, they would not) the whole gain to the Prince would be 2<HI>s. per</HI> 100 weight, or 2<HI>l.</HI> a ton; which
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
upon 2500 tons (the quantity supposed to be annually raised) amounts to 5000<HI>l. per ann.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="June"/>Lady Middlesex, Lord Bathurst, Mr. Breton, and I waited on their Royal High∣nesses to Spitalfields, to see the manufac∣tory of silk, and to Mr. Carr's shop in the morning. In the afternoon, the same company with Lady Torrington in wait∣ing, went in private coaches to Norwood Forest to see a settlement of gypsies. We returned and went to Bettesworth, the conjurer, in hackney coaches—Not finding him, we went in search of the little Dutch∣man, but were disappointed; and con∣cluded the particularities of this day, by supping with Mrs. Cannon, the Princess's midwife.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="June"/>I had a long conversation with Mr. Ralph about the prosecution intended a∣gainst his paper.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="July"/>Mr. Furnese, Mr. Ralph, and I dined with Mr. Oswald at Wandsworth. We
<PB N="81" REF="93"/>
had much talk upon publick affairs. Re∣solved at my return to meet and prepare for parliamentary enquiry, such points as should appear most liable to censure; par∣ticularly to look into the grounds of Mr. Lascelles's quietus by privy seal: the ex∣penditure during the war: the manage∣ment of the ordnance office: the affair of Nova Scotia, and the Canada expedition, &amp;c. Mr. Oswald was entirely disposed to assist us.</P>
<P>Dined with Lord Talbot, who informed<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="July"/> me of the many lies which were told of me to the Prince, and the unalterable in∣veteracy of the family against me. God forgive them—I have not deserved it of them.</P>
<P>I offered Dr. Thomson a room in my<MILESTONE N="5." UNIT="July"/> house, and 50<HI>l. per ann.</HI> which he ac∣cepted.</P>
<P>I sent to Mr. Ralph, by Whitehead, a<MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="August"/> scheme of opposition to be communicated to Lords Middlesex and Talbot, Sir Fran∣cis
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
Dashwood, Messrs. Furnese and Os∣wald.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Sept."/>Sir Francis Dashwood told me at Wy∣combe what he had learned of Mr. Boone, <HI>viz.</HI>—that my adversaries were satisfied, that my design, when I came into the fa∣mily, was to turn them all out, even to the women, &amp;c.—that the Prince told Boone, that I forced myself into his service, and that he could not help taking me, &amp;c.— that Lord Egmont said he knew, that the Prince never advised with, or communi∣cated any thing to me, &amp;c.—that Lord Egmont defrayed the Prince's expences at Bath, &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Sept."/>Messrs. Furnese and Ralph came to me. We had much conversation. We agreed that the Prince should, as soon as possible, be brought to some ecclaircissement, and be informed with proof, of the lies that have been told of me, by Lords Egmont and Baltimore, &amp;c.—that otherwise I could not act in publick with them.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="95"/>Went to a meeting at the King's Arms Tavern, Change Alley, at eleven o'clock,<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Sept."/> about the herring fishery. Proposed to chuse the governor, &amp;c. by lists, which was much opposed by the Scotch interest. I argued for it, from the authority of the act of parliament, and at last prevailed by 19 against 7.</P>
<P>I carried Mr. Ralph to Mr. Waller's in<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Sept."/> three hours. Much debate about the means of forming an opposition and its end: at length, Mr. Waller promised to act heartily with me, and we agreed to be∣gin with the ordnance.</P>
<P>Went to Lord Middlesex's at Ashley.<MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Sept."/> Much talk with my Lord that day and the next morning. We agreed that the coun∣try was in a deplorable state, and that the safety of the Prince's succession was in great danger, from the maxims he had adopted, and in which he was encouraged by those he most attended to at present. It was also agreed, that Lord Middlesex should procure an explanation, or that both
<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
of us should neither meddle with, nor ap∣pear in the business of the House.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Sept."/>At Leicester House. Lord Bute kissed hands for the bed-chamber. Col. Robin∣son, as equerry. The latter, as well as Lord North, is to remain under the title of servant to the Prince, but both are to attend the Princes George and Edward, as governor and equerry.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Nov."/>The King landed about twelve o'clock at Harwich, and came to St. James's be∣tween ten and eleven.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Nov."/>Westminster bridge opened. Mr. Tucker and I went to Mr. Scrope's, to desire him to acquaint Mr. Pelham, that, as we sup∣posed, when he engaged for the charter at Weymouth, he understood that he was to have two friends there, during this parlia∣ment, though no such conditions were ac∣tually expressed, yet, if Mr. Plummer should die (who was that day cut for the stone) we were too nice upon points of honour, to take the advantage of what
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
might be implied, though not specified, and therefore we would chuse any unex∣ceptionable gentleman he should name. But we would not chuse any other, or one, who, by his relations or situation, might seem to be put there, with a view to make a separate interest. And we should consi∣der the insisting upon such an one, as a premeditated design to make war, which, when we were in the right, we were ready to begin as soon as he pleased.</P>
<P>Mr. Tucker and I met Mr. Pelham, at<MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Dec."/> Mr. Scrope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by appointment: we settled the Weymouth re-election, according to the agreement made, on obtaining the new charter, and he recommended Lord George Cavendish.</P>
<P>Dined at Mr. Masham's: had a long,<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="Dec."/> and, I hope, a useful and productive con∣sultation all the morning, with Messrs. Oswald, Furnese, and Ralph.</P>
<P>Renewal of the consultation of last Mon∣day,<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Jan."/> with Messrs. Furnese, Oswald, and
<PB N="86" REF="98" MS="y"/>
Ralph. Some progress made. Supped at Lady Middlesex's. It being twelfth night (Monday) she staked 75 guineas and I 125 with the Prince, who sent us word that we had lost 8 guineas between us. Spent the week at Kew, where we had plays every day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Jan."/>Lord Talbot joined our party at my house, and we made farther progress in business.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Jan."/>At one o'clock received orders to dine and sleep at Kew. Ladies Middlesex and Torrington, Mr. Masham, and I went to∣gether. Played at Farao. Lord Bathurst came on horseback.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Jan."/>Came to town to the drawing-room. Dined at Carleton House. The Prince, Lords Granby, Middlesex, Carlisle, Eg∣mont, Limerick, Sir John Rushout, Sir Thomas Bootle, Dr. Lee, Messrs. Bathurst, Henley, Nugent, Gibbon, and I.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Jan."/>The session opened. Long debate upon
<PB N="87" REF="99" MS="y"/>
the address—division 74 to 203—mighty simple.</P>
<P>Lord Westmoreland was here. I pro∣posed<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Jan."/> a co-operation with a small number of peers, which he seemed to approve of, and promised to endeavour to make it practicable.</P>
<P>Spent the morning in farther prosecu∣tion<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Jan."/> of the business with Lord Talbot, Sir Francis Dashwood, Messrs. Furnese, Waller, Oswald, and Ralph.</P>
<P>Went in private coaches with their<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Jan."/> Royal Highnesses, Ladies Middlesex and Howe, Lord Inchiquin, and Sir Thomas Bootle, to Mr. Glasse's, where we sent for a conjurer.</P>
<P>The Prince's birth-day kept. Dined<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Jan."/> with me Marquis de Mirepoix, General Wall, Mons. d'Abrien, Compte de Perron, Abbé di Grossa-testa, Mons. de Lossandiere, Marquis d'Ayè, Comptes de la Marmora, and de Lascary, Baron de St. Fiorent,
<PB N="88" REF="100" MS="y"/>
Comte de Haslang, Duke of Queensberry, Lord Talbot, Sir Francis Dashwood, and Mr. Breton.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Jan."/>Debate upon some queries about the Army, that were dispersed abroad—agree with the Lords to burn them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Feb."/>Have been very ill for the fortnight past: but this day went to the House to hear the charge against Mr. Murray, brother to Lord Elibank, for words spoken against the High Bailiff, the day of his making the Return for Westminster, (15th of May last). After the trial was over, and the first question moved, I left the House, and returned to Hammersmith. Never saw an accusation worse supported by any thing but numbers.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Feb."/>Mr. Oswald, with other friends, was with me, who treated me in the most af∣fectionate and friendly manner: told me all his views, and the offers that had been made to him, and concluded by saying, that he wished to act always with me, and
<PB N="89" REF="101" MS="y"/>
that he would accept of the Prince's ser∣vice, if he might come into it as my friend, and by and through my hands, but that he would not come in by any other hands or canal.</P>
<P>Went to wait on his Royal Highness at<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Feb."/> Kew—proposed to him the securing Mr. Oswald by my weight with him—the Prince hesitated a little, as having made a trial, some time ago, by another hand without success. At last he allowed the importance of the acquisition, and ordered me to sound Mr. Oswalds disposition to∣wards it—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Royal Highness ordered me to dine and sleep there.</P>
<P>Mr. Oswald dined with me, and agreed<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Feb."/> to come to Hammersmith the next morn∣ing, to settle what report I should make to the Prince.</P>
<P>Mr. Oswald came this morning and was<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Feb."/> pleased to put himself entirely into my hands, and to rely upon my friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="102" MS="y"/>Dr. Lee came to me. I talked over to <MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Feb."/>him, at large, the points of the Spanish treaty—Mr. Lascelles's privy seal—The ordnance contract—and the expedition— He seemed to approve of them, and I gave him several papers to look over at home. He told me very frankly that, whatever I proposed, he would cheerfully support with all his power in the debate; but as he was enjoined secrecy, he could not be the mover or seconder, because that would look like breaking short with Lord Eg∣mont, and with others he had acted with.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Feb."/>Dr. Lee returned my papers, and thought that the treaty would not be a point strong enough, but he approved of the others.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Feb."/>Had a conference with his Royal Highness, and I began with telling him, that on Monday Mr. Oswald was with me, to acquaint me that he had received posi∣tive offers from Court; he was surprised, and asked me what they were: I told him that though, as I owed my first duty to
<PB N="91" REF="103" MS="y"/>
him, I ought not to conceal any thing from him that related to his service; yet that there were also other duties that I held sacred, and if I should discover the secret of a friend to him, I hoped his Royal Highness would be pleased to pro∣mise me that it should go no farther. He promised me, and I then told him, that Mr. Oswald had been offered to be made Comptroller of the Navy, with a promise that he should have the assistance of all Mr. Pelham's power to reform the abuses of it, and full liberty to follow his own opinion in Parliament, and that he came to ask my advice upon it. The Prince, concluding he would accept of the place, said he was glad he should find so honest a man in business. I told him, that, from the many reasons I had given him, he de∣clared to me that, as he saw no reformation could be thoroughly and effectually brought about, but by the concurrence of the Crown, which was not to be hoped for in our present situation, he had much rather attach himself to his Royal High∣ness from whom only he could hope for
<PB N="92" REF="104" MS="y"/>
that concurrence; but as he was no Cour∣tier and had no connections of that kind he must be contented to do his best in the station that was offered to him. That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bade him seriously consider whether, in case I would venture to sound his Royal Highness's disposition towards him, he would impower me to say that he would refuse all offers of the Court, if the Prince was willing to admit him into his service —That he told me, I positively might: upon which I promised to undertake it. After a good deal of talk, the Prince thanked me, and ordered me to send Mr. Oswald to him at Leicester House between seven and eight o'clock on Thursday next.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Feb."/>Mr. Oswald dined with me—he told me, he was much embarrassed at what had pas∣sed, since he saw me; of which he gave me the following account: Sunday the se∣venteenth, Sir Henry Ereskine was intro∣duced to the Prince for the first time; on Monday the eighteenth, Mr. Oswald was with me to settle the report I was to make to the Prince—on Tuesday the nineteenth,
<PB N="93" REF="105" MS="y"/>
Sir Harry asked him in the House—have you received any message from the Prince? what do you mean, he returned? has the Earl of Egmont delivered you no message? —I don't know the Earl of Egmont. He will then, replied Sir Harry, for I was in∣troduced to the Prince last Sunday, and he asked me if I knew you—I said, yes, inti∣mately—he then asked how you were dis∣posed towards him—I replied, that I thought you had the highest regard for him, &amp;c. His Royal Highness then said, I must send to him by Dr. Lee or Lord Eg∣mont, for what comes from them, is the same as if it came from me. This seemed strange to us, but I think the drift is evi∣dent.</P>
<P>Went to the Earl of Shaftesbury's.<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Feb."/> Much talk with him about separating the Tories from the Jacobites, on the quarrel between them about the late University election, which was to be done by bring∣ing them to a declaration of few heads, which, he said, he had made use of, and hoped he should succeed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="106"/>Mr. Oswald came to me from the <MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Feb."/>Prince, whom he found at Carleton House —He was received very graciously, and the Prince talked to him on many sub∣jects and of many persons, but never men∣tioned my name—They agreed that Mr. Oswald was to have the Green Cloth, and to kiss hands on lady-day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="March"/>Went to the House. Mr. Townshend advised with me about General Anstru∣ther's affair. I begged him to be very sure of his proofs, before he began a charge in Parliament—He desired leave to come to me to morrow and to shew me his pa∣pers, which I agreed to, but desired him to consult with wiser persons than me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="March"/>Mr. Townshend came and I fairly shew∣ed him, that calling for the reports in council would lead him to embarrass the Ministry, who, in this case of Anstruther, had delayed justice: that I should be glad, it should come forward, but not from him, apprising him where his motion would end, since he asked my advice as a friend, &amp;c.
<PB N="95" REF="107"/>
He thanked me much, and it being late, he desired to come again to morrow morn∣ing.</P>
<P>Went to Leicester House, but just as I<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="March"/> was going, Mr. Townshend came, and to my infinite surprise told me that he had been with the Earl of Egmont, who had given him a question which comprehended the civil and military behaviour of Gene∣ral Anstruther, which he would read to me. He did so, and asked my opinion. I was astonished at his ignorance, and said, I had nothing to object to it.</P>
<P>Motion by Mr. Townshend seconded by<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="March"/> Colonel Haldane, for copies of all courts martial held by Anstruther, while he commanded in Minorca; and of all com∣plaints against him in council, and the pro∣ceedings thereupon. Agreed, without di∣vision, to drop the courts martial till some particular facts were alledged, but to suffer the council papers to come.</P>
<P>Went to Leicester House, where the<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="March"/>
<PB N="96" REF="108"/>
Prince told me he had catched cold, the day before, at Kew, and had been blooded.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="March"/>The Prince not recovered. Our passing the next week at Kew put off.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="March"/>At Leicester House. The Prince was better, and saw company.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="March"/>At Leicester House. The Prince did not appear, having a return of a pain in his side.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="March"/>At Leicester House. The Prince asleep —twice blooded, and with a blister on his back, as also on both legs that night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="March"/>The Prince had a plentiful evacuation, and was out of all danger.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="March"/>The Prince without pain or fever.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="March"/>Went twice to Leicester House. The Prince had a bad night, till one this morn∣ing, then was better, and continued so.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="109"/>The Prince better, and sat up half an hour.<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Mar."/></P>
<P>Went to Leicester House; from thence<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Mar."/> to the House of Commons, and then to Hammersmith. I was told at Leicester House, at three o'clock, that the Prince was much better, and had slept eight hours in the night before, while, I suppose, the mortification was forming, for he died this evening a quarter before ten o'clock, as I found by a letter from Mr. Breton at six o'clock the following morning.</P>
<P>I came immediately to town, and learned<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Mar."/> from Mr. Breton, who was at Leicester House, when the Prince died, that, for half an hour before, he was very chearful, asked to see some of his friends, eat some bread and butter, and drank coffee: he had spit for some days, and was at once seized with a fit of coughing and spitting, which last was so violent, that it suffocated him. Lord North was sent to the King. This morning the King ordered the body to be opened—an abseess was found in his
<PB N="98" REF="110" MS="y"/>
side, the breaking of which destroyed him. His physicians, Wilmot and Lee, knew nothing of his distemper; as they declared, half an hour before he died, that his pulse was like a man's in perfect health. They either would not see, or did not know the consequences of the black thrush, which appeared in his mouth, and quite down into his throat. Their ignorance, or their knowledge of his disorder, renders them equally inexcusable for not calling in other assistance.</P>
<P>From Tuesday the 12th, when he sup∣ped at Carleton House, and when he re∣lapsed before he went to bed, the Princess never suffered any English man or woman, above the degree of a Valet de Chambre, to see him; nor did she vouchsafe to see any one, man, or lady of the family, not even the Lady in waiting, till Sunday last, when it was absolutely necessary that some∣body should appear to receive compli∣ments; and then Lady Scarborough was ordered, instead of a Lord, who as she ap∣prehended, might have expected to see the
<PB N="99" REF="111" MS="y"/>
Prince. She saw Dr. Lee one day before the death, and, just after the event, she had a long conference, till past twelve, with him and the Earl of Egmont. This morning Lady Middlesex saw her, but was not sent for. Lord Middlesex sent his compliments, and was admitted. She sent in for the Duke of Chandois, and also for the Earl of Scarborough at night.</P>
<P>When this unfortunate event happened, I had set on foot, by the means of the Earl of Shaftesbury, a project for an union be∣tween the independent Whigs and Tories, by a writing renouncing all tincture of Jaco∣bitism, and affirming short, but constituti∣onal and revolutional principles. I had given his Lordship the paper: his good heart and understanding made him indefatigable, and so far successful, that there were good grounds to hope for an happy issue. These parties, so united, were to lay this paper, containing these principles, before the Prince; offering to appear as his party, now; and upon those principles to un∣dertake the administration, when he was
<PB N="100" REF="112"/>
King, in the subordination and rank among themselves, that he should please to appoint.—Father of mercy! thy hand, that wounds, alone can save!</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Mar."/>Several, in much distress, here. The Earl of Shaftesbury and Mr. William Beckford here, by their own appointment; they said, they came to ask directions what to do under this fatal change of situation: I said, that it appeared to me that, if the Pelham party did not, instantly, drive out the Bed∣ford interest, they must be driven out by that, though now the weakest party; but that the Bedford party would become the strongest, having the King's favourite, and, now, only son at their head, and at the head of the army; that he would, by their interest, small as it might be, and by the military interest, force the regency, and then, where are the Pelhams? That this necessity enforced the necessity of the projected union—that, being collected and publickly purged from Jacobitism, they be∣came a respectable body: that if they were applied to for assistance, they might then
<PB N="101" REF="113"/>
give it upon such conditions, and for such share of power as they might think safe and honourable for themselves and their country. Secondly, If they were not ap∣plied to, and the court should take a right turn, that then they might, like honest and disinterested men, support the court without coming into it. And lastly, What was most to be dreaded, if they were not applied to, and the court should take either a dangerous turn, or should continue in the same consuming way as at present, that then they would be ready to do, what it was their duty to do—oppose to the ut∣most and declare that they mean to wrest the administration out of those hands, to take it into their own, and apply it to bet∣ter purposes. That despair, which was blameable before, was now become cri∣minal.</P>
<P>My company went away, much satisfied and determined to act accordingly.</P>
<P>I went to Leicester House. The Prin∣cess afflicted, but well. Went to council,
<PB N="102" REF="114"/>
at night, which was very full. The com∣mon prayer altered, but Prince George left, as he now stands. The physicians made a report, and delivered a paper, being an ac∣count of the body when opened—I have a copy of it—Ordered the bowels to be put into a box covered with red velvet, and carried in one of the Prince's coaches, by such attendants as his Groom of the Stole should appoint, and buried in Henry the VIIth's chapel. Ordered a committee to settle the ceremonies of the funeral.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Mar."/>Went to the Earl of Westmoreland's— Lord Guernsey there—held a conversation upon the present affairs—the Earl said that he heard, that Sir John Hynde Cot∣ton had proposed sending for Gentlemen up, acquainting them at the same time, that nothing was to be proposed to them, but to sit still and wait events. I modestly doubted of that measure, from experience of the disposition of those country gen∣tlemen, who, I thought, would neither come, if nothing was proposed, nor stay, if there was nothing to do; but yet, who
<PB N="103" REF="115"/>
would implicitly follow a few of their Lordships in one or the other: from which it followed, that their Lordships should form a set of propositions for the centre of union, and then should call them together to own them, and act upon them, either taking places (if they were to be had upon honourable terms) or act∣ing without them.</P>
<P>I was, in every part, most warmly sup∣ported by Lord Guernsey, and by Sir Ed∣ward Deering, who came in. I left them together, and thought by the very af∣fectionate manner of Lord Westmoreland, when I left the room, that I had never be∣fore made such impression upon him.</P>
<P>Went to the Duke of Dorset's—much<MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Mar."/> talk. He thinks of the state of the nation and of the Pelhams, just as we do; as also of the danger from the Duke of Cumber∣land. At the Speaker's, he also in the same way of thinking with us.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="116"/><MILESTONE N="1751."/>Long conversation with Lord Limerick, <MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Mar."/>He thinks with us—but we both agreed, that the Pelhams have not sufficient reso∣lution to do any thing great.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Mar."/>Went to council. Orders to the Lord Steward and Chamberlain to issue warrants for black cloth, wax lights, &amp;c, for the rooms at Westminster, where the body is to be laid, &amp;c. To the Groom of the Stole and Master of the Horse to his late Royal Highness, to regulate the march of the servants, &amp;c. Orders to the Earl Marshall to direct the Heralds to prepare, for the consideration of the council, a ce∣remonial for the funeral of his Royal High∣ness, upon the plan of those of the Duke of Gloucester and of Prince George of Den∣mark, which were formed upon the plan of the funeral of Charles the second.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Mar."/>Sir Francis Dashwood from the Earl of Westmoreland desired to know, if I thought it prudent to make an overture to Mr. Pelham, as a party to join him, if he would engage to lower the land tax next year to
<PB N="105" REF="117"/>
two shillings in the pound, and reduce the army. I sent my duty to the Earl, and beg'd to know, if he thought we were united enough to make overtures as a par∣ty; and if so, what the party was to do in return, in case Mr. Pelham should comply. These conditions are nugatory, and yet, the last, of all others, the most difficult to obtain. If we were united, we should, now, demand great and national conditions, for the safety of the whole, which will be as easily obtained, at least, as the reduction of the army at present, and which reduction, except in the view of oeconomy, is trifling. Any army may be equally ruinous; and yet some must be kept till the nation can be armed by a pro∣per regulation of the militia.</P>
<P>At the Speaker's, where we turned over<MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Mar."/> precedents, with relation to the grants of the Dutchy of Cornwall, and of the govern∣ment during minorities.</P>
<P>Saw Mr. Prowse, and found him well<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="Mar."/> disposed to the main system. The King
<PB N="106" REF="118"/>
was at Leicester House. This night died the Earl of Oxford.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="April"/>At council, about the funeral. Cere∣monial from the Heralds read—their orders were to form it on the plan of the Duke of Gloucester's and Prince George's of Denmark. But they had different orders privately, which, <HI>then</HI>, I did not know. I thought there was very little cere∣mony, and therefore said, that I supposed, that they had complied with the orders, which their Lordships gave about the plans, on which this funeral was to be formed. The Lords said, to be sure; and none seemed to have any doubts, or con∣cerned themselves about it; so I said no more, though I am satisfied, it is far short of any funeral of any son of a King. After the council was up, I asked the Lord Chancellor about it, who said that he supposed the Heralds had complied with their orders, but that he knew nothing of it, and had never seen any of the plans. I told him that I mentioned it, because, if it should appear that any mark of respect
<PB N="107" REF="119"/>
to the deceased should be wanting in this funeral, it would certainly give great dis∣taste. I think the plan must be altered.</P>
<P>The King was at Leicester House.<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="April"/></P>
<P>Saw the Earl of Westmoreland, but, his<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="April"/> lady being present, could not talk fully with him. Mr. Glover dined with me, and the Earl of Shaftesbury came in the afternoon, and we agreed to drive it to a short issue with the Earls of Westmoreland and Oxford, either to form a regular party immediately, or to give the point entirely up. If a party should be formed, then to fix the subscription for a paper by Mr. Ralph, to be supported by about twenty of us, at ten guineas each, and by what else we can get.</P>
<P>Went to Mr. Oswald's—from thence to<MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="April"/> the Earl of Westmoreland, with whom, and Earl Stanhope, I had a long conversa∣tion. I left them, persuaded of the neces∣sity of forming a party, united by consti∣tutional principles, which should be re∣duced
<PB N="108" REF="120"/>
into writing and signed by all the party. Much talk, of those principles, of which I mentioned such as occurred to me and of which they approved. I told them that I had once drawn such a politi∣cal creed for the last opposition, but the gentlemen did not care to sign it. That, now, I thought the younger part of our friends were very much in earnest, and only wanted proper leaders and proper points to unite heartily. The Lords agreed that something should be digested imme∣diately: I told them that, to make a be∣ginning, if they pleased, I would send them the paper mentioned, in which some hints might possibly be of use; they seemed very desirous of seeing it, and I went home, and sent it directly to the Earl of Westmoreland. I have done enough, and henceforth shall live to myself the years, which God in his mercy may grant me, unless I am called upon to assist.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="April"/>I had much talk with Mr. Oswald on the state of affairs, and I told him the steps I had taken towards an union of parties:
<PB N="109" REF="121"/>
that I thought I owed it to our friendship to acquaint him that, if this great plan could be effected, I must take my share in it. He approved the greatness and ho∣nesty of the design, and, at the same time, told me that Mr. Pelham had renewed his offers since the Prince's death, to which he had returned a very general, cool answer: he said that he hoped, from the renewing that offer, to find that Mr. Pel∣ham would shew resolution enough to enter into engagements with some more of us, and avail himself of the present disposi∣tions of the people, to put himself upon his country, and get rid of his open ene∣mies and false friends, which was, now, most practicable and even necessary to pre∣vent his being undone by both.</P>
<P>Lord Limerick consulted with me about<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="April"/> walking at the funeral. By the Earl Mar∣shall's order, published in the common newspaper of the day (which, with the ceremonial not published till ten o'clock, I keep by me) neither he, as an Irish Peer, nor I, as a Privy Counsellor, could walk.
<PB N="110" REF="122"/>
He expressed a strong resolution to pay his last duty to his royal friend, if practi∣cable. I beg'd him to stay till I could get the ceremonial; he did, and we there found, in a note, that we might walk. Which note, published seven or eight hours before the attendance required, was all the notice that Lords, their sons, and Privy Counsellors had (except those ap∣pointed to particular functions) that they would be admitted to walk.</P>
<P>At seven o'clock I went, according to the order, to the House of Lords. The many slights that the poor remains of a much-loved master and friend had met with, and who was now preparing the last trouble he could give his enemies, sunk me so low that, for the first hour, I was incapa∣ble of making any observation.</P>
<P>The procession began, and (except the Lords appointed to hold the pall and at∣tend the chief mourner, and those of his own domestics) when the attendants were called in their ranks, there was not one
<PB N="111" REF="123"/>
English Lord, not <HI>one</HI> Bishop, and only one Irish Lord (Limerick), two sons of Dukes (Earl of Drumlandrig and Lord Robert Bertie), one Baron's son (Mr. Edge∣cumbe) and two Privy Counsellors (Sir John Rushout and myself), out of these great bodies, to make a show of duty to a Prince, so great in rank and expectation. While we were in the House of Lords, it rained very hard, as it has done all the sea∣son; when we came into Palace Yard, the way to the Abbey was lined with soldiers, but the managers had not afforded the smallest covering over our heads; but, by good fortune, while we were from under cover, it held up. We went in at the S. E. door, and turned short into Henry the VIIth's chapel. The service was per∣formed without either anthem or organ. So ended this sad day—<HI>Quem semper acer∣bum—semper honoratum</HI>.</P>
<P>The corps and bowels were removed, last night, to the Prince's lodgings at the House of Lords; the whole bed-chamber were ordered to attend them from ten in the
<PB N="112" REF="124"/>
morning till the <HI>enterrement</HI>. There was not the attention to order the Green-Cloth to provide them a bit of bread, and these gentlemen, of the first rank and distinction, in discharge of their last sad duty to a loved and a loving master, were forced to bespeak a great cold dinner from a common tavern in the neighbourhood. At three o'clock indeed, they vouchsafed to think of a din∣ner and ordered one—but the disgrace was compleat, the tavern dinner was paid for, and given to the poor. N. B. The Duke of Somerset was chief mourner, notwith∣standing the flourishing state of the Royal family.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="April"/>Lord Shaftesbury came to acquaint me, that the project of union went on very successfully. I advised him to appoint a meeting, for to morrow, of the Earls of Westmoreland, Oxford, and Stanhope, to settle the points in writing, that are to be the centre of that union. Dined at Sir Francis Dashwood's, where Earl Stanhope read to us the draught of a
<PB N="113" REF="125"/>
preamble to such points, which was ex∣tremely good.</P>
<P>Went to the House—the motion to put<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="April"/> off the third reading of the naturalization bill for two months, was carried by 129 against 116. The report of the dismission of the Duke of Bedford and Earl of Sand∣wich, and of the introduction of the Earl of Holderness and Lord Anson into their places, is not true; but it is likely to happen.—If so, they surely design to cur∣tail the Southern Province.</P>
<P>At the House. Mr. George Townshend<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="April"/> opened General Anstruther's affair, and moved a question concerted with the Court, which was that his Majesty should be ad∣dressed to inforce his orders, in consequence of the report of his council, to oblige Lieutenant General Anstruther to make some satisfaction to those of Minorca whom he had oppressed—which must be very unsatisfactory and insufficient. Mr. Townshend, who, of his own accord, en∣gaged in this affair; who, of his own ac∣cord,
<PB N="114" REF="126"/>
on very slight acquaintance, desired my advice, and whom I treated with great generosity, as he acknowledged to me and others; who imprudently went from me to the Earl of Egmont, and brought from that Lord a long, inflammatory question, which he desired me to correct, and which I declined; who received from me the proper question in writing, concluding with one to establish a civil government in Minorca. This gentleman, without giving me the least intimation, contents himself with moving this tame court ques∣tion: and Lord Egmont, that Lord, the other day, so violent, who drew a question so very different, thought fit even to ab∣sent himself on the present.—Such won∣ders has the poor Prince's death already produced!</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="April"/>Dined at Lord Middlesex's. Was told that Mr. Montague, as Auditor to the Princess, Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Boone, in the room of Sir John Cust, as Clerks of the Green Cloth, Mr. Bludworth as Master of the Horse, Messrs. Leslie, Scot,
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
and Robinson, as Equerries, kissed the Princess's hand this day.</P>
<P>Dined at Sir Francis Dashwood's. Find<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="April"/> by Lord Talbot, that we are not likely to come to a union; for, now, the terms they propose to sign, are of a sort that im∣ply an exclusion of coming into office— Now, as no good can be done to this coun∣try, but by good men coming into office, it is all over, and I give up all thoughts of ever being, any farther, useful to man∣kind.</P>
<P>At the House. Ereskine's accusation<MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="April"/> against Anstruther, baffled by the Court through the act of Grace.</P>
<P>Went to town to consult my constant<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="April"/> friend Mr. Bance, about retrieving, if possible, the captainship of the Dodington East Indiaman, which Mr. Tucker im∣prudently and unkindly opposes me in: he being concerned (though not equally with me) and having the management of my affairs, has led the rest of the proprie∣tors
<PB N="116" REF="128"/>
to think I was engaged, and so, to engage themselves to the person he espouses, which disappoints me in serving the person re∣commended to me by the Princess of Wales.</P>
<P>Mr. Bance has just brought Mr. Tucker to me, who desists from his engagement, but I am persuaded it is now too late.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="April"/>Went to town about the ship, but did no good. At the House. A message from the Crown to the Lords—then a message from the Lords, by Masters in Chancery, to the Commons to continue sitting some time—then a message from the Crown to the Commons, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, recommending the Princess of Wales for Regent, with such limita∣tions as the Houses shall think proper— then a message from the Lords, by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and the Chief Baron, with an address of thanks; agreed to <HI>nem. con.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="April"/>Attended the levèr—then at council.
<PB N="117" REF="129"/>
Lord Holderness brought over—for the seals as I suppose. Earl Harcourt sworn in. Earl of Egremont sworn as Lord Lieu∣tenant of Cumberland.</P>
<P>At the House. Resolutions to pave<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="May"/> Pall Mall by a pound rate: Sir Francis Dashwood, Lord Trentham, General Ogle∣thorpe and I, ordered to prepare the bill. Sense of the House taken, if the young Prince of Wales's new servants should be re-elected: it was agreed, not. The act was read; but those, who seemed to favour a re-election, forgot to call for the war∣rants, that appointed them servants to the Prince: by whom are they signed? If by the King, the case would not have admit∣ted a word of dispute. The persons con∣cerned, were Lord Down, Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber; Mr. Selwyn, sen. Trea∣surer; and Mr. Stone, Sub-Governor.</P>
<P>Saw several of my neighbours about the<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="May"/> pavement, and sent them away pretty well satisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="130"/>Went to the House of Lords. The <MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="May"/>regency bill brought in and opened by the Duke of Newcastle. Second reading to-morrow. Nothing said, but by the Bi∣shop of Worcester, who moved, that it might be printed, and that the Lords might have time to consider it, between the second reading and committal. The Duke of Newcastle agreed to the printing, and it passed, upon the question put. In less than ten minutes after the question was carried, the Duke got up and said, that he was told by some of the Lords, that it was very improper to print the bill, upon which they resolved not to print it, and the Bishop, being supported by no one Lord, very decently offered to withdraw his motion.—Surely, it was too late after it became a question, voted and agreed to.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="May"/>At the House of Lords. Regency bill read a second time, and committed for Fri∣day: not a word said against it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="May"/>Had intelligence that, upon a message from the Earl of Bath, the Princess had
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
signified her entire approbation of this bill. I had much consultation what was to be done, considering how many fruit∣less pains (as it now appeared) I had taken to unite and form a party, and yet no sort of concert was thought upon, even in these great points. The opinion seemed to be, that I should not go to the House.</P>
<P>Went to the House of Lords. They<MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="May"/> went into a committee upon the regency bill. The clause for erecting the council was opposed by Earl Stanhope alone, who said that such a council was a novelty, and that he was against it, because he thought it unnecessary, till he heard better reasons given for it, than he had, as yet, heard. Nobody answered, or supported him, and he gave no other reasons. So the clause was carried by a division of 92 against 12. When they came to the clause of prolong∣ing the Parliament, Lord Talbot stood up, and shewed the weakness of the Chancel∣lor's arguments, which were drawn from history; and then said, the prolonging the Parliament was an invasion of the people's
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>
rights, that it was the means of perpe∣tuating <MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="May"/>a corrupt one, and was one of those things that the whole legislature could not do, because they could have no legal power to do it. Lord Granville spoke warmly for it, as the best part of the bill, all of which he approved of; and no one Lord seconded or supported Lord Talbot.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="May"/>I communicated to Mr. Ralph my pre∣sent resolution of no more meddling with publick affairs, till some party, worth ap∣pearing with, shall unite in the service of the country.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="May"/>Dined with Sir Francis Dashwood, and the other gentlemen concerned about the paving bill. I did not go to the House, where the regency bill was read the first time. Sir Francis came home and ac∣quainted me that nobody but Mr. Thomas Pitt and he spoke against the bill. The Tories totally silent. The Court for it. Dr. Lee and Mr. Nugent speaking for it. All the Princess's and late Prince's court for it.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="133"/>Committee of the regency bill—the clause establishing the council debated;<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="May"/> opposed, in a very fine speech, by the Speaker. Mr. William Pitt and Mr. Fox had high words, though they were both for the bill. Mr. Pitt for the restrictions, lest the next Regent should claim full powers, if the Princess should die, glancing at the Duke. Mr. Fox also for them, but defending the Duke. They replied upon each other two or three times, but Mr. Fox did not vote at last. Mr. Pitt and the Grenvilles in office voted for the bill, but Lord Cobham spoke and voted against it. Thus it was reported to me, but I was not there.</P>
<P>They went, to day, in the House, upon<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="May"/> the clause of prolonging the Parliament. The committee sat late. No concert be∣tween any five people, as I am told.</P>
<P>Was to wait on the Duke of Newcastle,<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="May"/> to thank him for getting me permission to drive through St. James's Park, while the King is at Kensington. We parted very
<PB N="122" REF="134"/>
civilly. Paid Lord Middlesex 140<HI>l.</HI> for a set of seven of the Prince's horses.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="May"/>Went to Kensington, and kissed the young Prince of Wales's hand, but did not see the King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="May"/>Went to town, to return by water with the Spanish and Sardinian ministers, Messrs. Lascaris, St. Fiorent, and Lord Barrington. We landed at Hammersmith, where we were met by the Marquis de Mirepoix, the French ambassador, Mons. d'Abreu, and Lord Ashburnham, We all dined there.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="May"/>At the House about the paving bill, which was read a second time, and com∣mitted to a private committee.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="June"/>At the House. Reported the paving bill council, and much debate against it. Carried to go on with the amendments, but forced to adjourn at the first amend∣ment, because there were but 35 members present.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="135"/>This evening Lord Sandwich received his letter of dismission.<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="June"/></P>
<P>Heard that the Duke of Bedford resigned<MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="June"/> the seals of Secretary, this morning, at Kensington.</P>
<P>Lord Trentham resigned the Admiralty.<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="June"/></P>
<P>Was at council at Kensington. Earl of<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="June"/> Granville sworn in as President.</P>
<P>Lord Holderness received the seals of<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="June"/> Secretary this morning.</P>
<P>Lord Hartington introduced into the<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="June"/> House of Lords. Made Master of the Horse.</P>
<P>At council at Kensington. Earl of Hol∣derness<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="June"/> sworn first, as a counsellor, and then as Secretary of State. Duke of Bed∣ford and Lord Burleigh took the oath of office, as Lords Lieutenants of Devonshire and Rutlandshire.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="136"/>I waited on the Princess to take my <MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="June"/>leave: she received me in a very obliging manner. The Parliament rose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="June"/>This morning I wrote to the Duke of Newcastle, inclosing Colonel Milles's me∣morial, who is in the Emperor's service as Duke of Tuscany. The memorial set<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forth, that the Ostend Company bought two settlements, Banquibuzar and Covelon, of the Mogul: a rebel seized the province of Bengal in 1774, and took Banquibuza<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Emperor's governor. He desires the King to assist him, either in retaking the province, with the consent of, and for the Mogul, or, in making war upon the usurper, who took and still retains his sorts. He submits to the King, entirely, the share and disposition of the gains, and the plan of the expedition.</P>
<P>This plan was attempted about six years ago, and cost the Emperor 15,000<HI>l.</HI> and we prevented its execution at the instiga∣tion of the East India Company. Mr. Milles assures me that the province of
<PB N="125" REF="137"/>
Bengal is the richest in the known world; that he knows where to lay his hands on fifty millions sterling; that he can make himself master of it with 1500 men, (and he designs to carry no more) which the Emperor will furnish—all that he demands of us is shipping, and stores, &amp;c. enough to carry them, to be added to the three ships which the Emperor now has, and which he bought for this expedition be∣fore, at the time when we disappointed it.</P>
<P>Went to Eastbury.<MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="June"/></P>
<P>On Wednesday evening the Princess<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="July"/> walked in Carleton Gardens, supped and went to bed very well: she was taken ill about six o'clock on Thursday morning, and, about eight, was delivered of a Prin∣cess. Both well. This morning died the Duke of St. Alban at London.</P>
<P>The Western mail robbed near Black-water,<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="July"/> by one man, about one o'clock on Monday morning.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="138"/>We dined at Mr. William Churchill's; <MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="August"/>coming from thence, about six o'clock, from a causeway too narrow, in Mr. Churchill's meadow, called their private road, the coach was overturned into a wet ditch; the company, particularly the gen∣tlemen, were very wet, and if there had been a foot more of water, they must all have been suffocated. We were obliged to return to the house, and we played at cards till day-light.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Sept."/>Returned from Eastbury to Hammer∣smith.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Sept."/>News of the birth of a Duke of Bur∣gundy. Mons. de Mirepoix made a Duke and Peer of France.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Sept."/>The Comte de Richecourt, the Em∣peror's minister, and Colonel Milles, came here in the morning, to talk about the expedition to Bengal. I wrote, imme∣diately, an account of it to the Duke of Newcastle.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="139"/>Received a very civil letter from the Duke of Newcastle, about the expedition<MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="Oct."/> to Bengal.</P>
<P>Waited upon the Duke, and was very<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."/> kindly received; he told me all that had passed about Bengal, and put the event upon the consent and concurrence of the East India Company. Called upon Dr. Lee, who informed me that the gentlemen, ac∣cused of a secret treaty with the late Prince, had put it in issue with the King, that the Prince applied to them, and that they de∣clined it, and referred the King to the Princess for the truth of their assertion. This is bold, for I know the assertion to be false.</P>
<P>Went to wait on the Comte de Riche∣court,<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Oct."/> and the Bishop of London. Colo∣nel Milles came, to whom I delivered the Duke of Newcastle's directions, that, if he would consent that Mr. Drake and Alder∣man Baker, of the East India Company, should ask leave of the Court of Directors to receive proposals from him, they were
<PB N="128" REF="140"/>
ready to ask it, and if obtained, to ente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the matter with him.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Oct."/>Waited on the Princess, and was most graciously received. She was pleased to send for the Prince of Wales, Prince Ed∣ward, and the Princess Augusta.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Oct."/>Saw Mr. Dawkins's drawings of the an∣tiquities, which he saw in the East; they are exceedingly fine and curious.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Oct."/>Lord Chancellor, Lord President, and I, went from the Cockpit to dine with the Lord Mayor: there were none of the coun∣cil, except us three. Lord Granville and I went together.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Oct."/>The King's birth-day. The drawing-room in weepers.</P>

<P>The account which Gary brought to<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Nov."/> me, I think, puts an end to the Bengal expedition.</P>
<P>At the House. Order to commit Mr.<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Nov."/> Murray to Newgate renewed.</P>
<P>Last Saturday the Duke of Cumberland<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Nov."/> had a bad fall from his horse, while he was hunting at Windsor.</P>
<P>Went to council at St. James's, where<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Nov."/> proclamation, with 500<HI>l.</HI> reward, was or∣dered for apprehending Mr. Murray, in consequence of a resolution of the House.</P>
<P>This day died Lord Bolingbroke.<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Dec."/></P>
<P>Went to council, where the trustees for<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Dec."/> Georgia agreed to surrender their charter to the King, absolutely and uncondition∣ally.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="142"/>Was to wait upon the Princess of Wales▪ <MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Dec."/>Received in a manner most remarkably kind by her and all the royal children.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1752."/>Waited upon the Princess, whose kind∣ness <MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="Jan."/>seemed to encrease towards me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Jan."/>The Solicitor General, with other com∣pany, dined with me. On a malicious report that I had forced myself upon the late Prince of Wales, and into his service, I explained the whole transaction to the Solicitor General, and produced to him, all the proper vouchers that verified it, step by step.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Jan."/>Went to council, where Lord Granville very imprudently drew in question the va∣lidity of the French treaty of commerce, making the goods of enemies on French bottoms free from capture. This was, however, left undecided.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Feb."/>Mr. Furnese dined with me, and gave me an account of what had passed between him and the Solicitor General (Mr. Mur∣ray)
<PB N="131" REF="143"/>
about a message to Mr. Tucker, by Mr. Ellis, from Mr. Pelham, to know what was to be done on a new election at Weymouth, pretending that the chusing two, at his nomination, was to last always. The Solicitor General entered into a detail of my affairs with much affection and warmth, and said, he knew there was not the least indisposition towards me in the ministry, but was afraid, that the King had been strongly prejudiced against me personally: that he would take it upon him to bring this matter to a proper issue, one way or another; as it was by no means fitting, that I should offer or ask for any thing, till I was sure of being well received. He behaved nobly, and like a friend. The event is with God.</P>
<P>Went to council. Gave the Solicitor<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Feb."/> General an account in writing, of the whole proceeding of the late Prince of Wales, in the demand of 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> in Parliament.</P>
<P>Went to the Cockpit to a prize cause,<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Feb."/>
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>
which turned upon the authenticity of the treaty of commerce with France; several Lords (of which the Lord President was one) doubted of its being in force. I did not, and it was at last decided by virtue of that treaty. We ended that long dispute of General Anstruther and Minorca, by referring the costs and damages he is to pay, to the Master of the Rolls and Gene∣ral Bland.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Feb."/>Mr. Furnese called on me. He had seen the Solicitor General, who had in∣formed him, that there was not the least indisposition in the Pelhams, but, on the contrary, a willingness to live well with me. That they said, it would not be im∣possible to remove the ill impressions made upon the King, but it required a little time, &amp;c. If they removed the Pitts, &amp;c. then it might be easy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="Feb."/>Mr. Ellis was with me: he introduced the talk of his election on a new Parlia∣ment. I told him, that I thought my behaviour, both publick and private, even
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
in opposition, never could have given just cause of offence to the Pelhams, or could have shewn any indisposition to live per∣sonally well with them: that, as I was, now, entirely free from engagements, I was sincerely desirous of Mr. Pelham's favour and friendship, if he would accept of my friendship and attachment: if then, he would accept of my services, he might, <HI>upon proper conditions</HI>, command my in∣terest, and in that case, nobody would be more welcome to me at Weymouth, than he, Mr. Ellis. That this was in Mr. Pelham's breast, who best knew his own disposition, but that mine was entirely inclined to be his friend and servant, <HI>upon proper conditions</HI>. This <HI>of proper conditions</HI>, was frequently repeated, and Mr, Ellis de∣fined to observe, that there was neither pro∣mise nor engagement.</P>
<P>Saw the Solicitor General by appoint∣ment,<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Feb."/> and found his report much less fa∣vourable than Mr. Furnese understood it. That the Pelhams were very well disposed to me, but that the King was so much
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
prejudiced against me by former misrepre∣sentations, that he feared they could answer for nothing, &amp;c. So we parted, I taking it for a thing entirely broken off, but he saying, that he did not yet see it in that light.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Feb."/>Waited on the Princess, and was very graciously received.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="March"/>The King's birth-day kept. I was at court.</P>

suspension between us and France, 1712) and the proclamations, here, and other acts of state, there—I delivered my opini∣on, at large, for restitution. The Lords took a further day to give judgment, but the majority seem to be with me, and I think, it must be so decided.</P>

<P>Went to council at St. James's—The<MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Mar."/> King declared the Regency, as usual, and the Councellors took leave and kissed his hand. The King set out, about four, the following morning for Harwich.</P>

<P><PB N="136" REF="148"/>Went to town to attend Dr. Thomson's <MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="April"/>action of defamation against Saxon the apothecary, at the King's Bench.—Began at six, ended at nine.—Evidences, speaking to the Doctor's skill and reputation, were the Duke of Roxburgh, Earl of Middlesex, Mr. Levison, Sir Francis Dashwood, Sir Francis Eyles, Mr. Drax and myself. He carried his cause and the jury gave 20<HI>l.</HI> damages.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="April"/>At council—the Solicitor General told me he had spoken to Mr. Pelham, as from himself—that there was a real good-will and desire to take me with them, but that they had fears to engage me, least they, on their part, should not be able to fulfil their engagements. That they were afraid of the King, and of the party (the old Walpolians) nick named the Black-tan, &amp;c. The Solicitor advised me by all means to see Mr. Pelham, and that I should meet with a friendly, confidential recep∣tion, &amp;c. &amp;c. This is nothing, but obli∣ges me to see him.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="149"/>Saw Mr. Pelham, by appointment, in Arlington Street—I began by telling him,<MILESTONE N="5." UNIT="May"/> that the applications I had received from Mr. Ellis about his election at Wey∣mouth, I considered as giving me handle to wait upon him; for I was come to offer him, not only that, but all the services in my power, and that I was authorised to say the same from all my friends. He said, he should willingly embrace it, were it not for fear, that he should not be able to ful∣fil what he wished to do, on his part. I asked, whether he would admit of a confi∣dential conversation—he said, he could have no reason to wish any other, and that what Ellis had said, was from him, and was meant to produce such a conversation. I then asked him, if there was any real inclination, in the Duke of Newcastle and him, to accept of us into their friend∣ship and protection, if objections could be removed; for that I knew the different fa∣cility of removing them, when there was a little good-will at the bottom, and when it was the work of importance, only—he would observe, that I did not arrogate im∣portance,
<PB N="138" REF="150"/>
but if I had it, I would accept of nothing that was only owing to that—that, at my time of life, nothing would tempt me to come into any Court, upon the foot of force and intrusion. That I said this, to explain to him, that I desired to live with him, and his, as their attached friend and servant; that I desired no rank which could justly create envy in my equals, or any sort of power that might occasion sus∣picion in my superiors. Reserving only, that, if he gave me a musket, and ordered me to a post, I should certainly fire. That, if clouds should arise, I was not a∣fraid at all, to meet the great geniuses now on the stage. Mr. Pelham said, that there were real good wishes and good-will, and for nobody more; but how to put them in execution was what hindered him from saying all he wished—that there were dif∣ficulties, and great ones, with the King, on account of my quitting his service for the Prince's, &amp;c. I replied, that I was a∣ware of such a prejudice; but that I be∣lieved, when it was represented to the King, and by him as his opinion, that I could be
<PB N="139" REF="151"/>
of some utility to his Majesty's service, by my own and by the weight of my friends, particularly in chusing several members, it would be the means of removing all pre∣judices. For that, though I knew that no pains had been spared to make him (Mr. Pelham) believe the contrary, yet I did a∣sure him, as a gentleman and his servant, that the interest of Weymouth was wholly in Mr. Tucker and me: that in the coun∣try it was impossible to chuse one member against us, at least, without the utmost vi∣olence: that, indeed, he could give us a great deal of trouble there, and, I owned, could chuse any four he pleased (by peti∣tion) at Westminster. But that, I knew, it was not in his temper, and I could not think it was for his interest to have re∣course to flagrant acts of violence, to chuse two members (which was the most he pre∣tended to,) when he might have all four, and me too, without any violence at all.</P>
<P>Mr. Pelham did not pretend to set up any right of the court, or that they design∣ed to make use of any force against me,
<PB N="140" REF="152"/>
but said, to be sure, what I had hinted must be the way, that he must take to∣wards the King, and that he would truly tell me all that he knew about the King's prejudice against me—that his Majesty was angry at my quitting, though he re∣ceived it better than he expected, as he had told me before: but at my going into the Prince's service afterwards, the King broke out and said to him, here is a fine end of civilities; here is Dodington, you made me give him, the other day, a great employment, and, now, he has thrown it at your head, and is gone over to my son, and besides, a nominal place is made for him, to give him a pretence of putting himself at the head of his measures, and more to this purpose—after this, upon my coming to Kensington, on a Sunday, some time after the Prince's death, the King said, I see Dodington here sometimes, what does he come for? to which Pelham replied, that he did not know, indeed, but he did not believe that I had any particular views, because he had never had the least hint of any; which, if I had formed any,
<PB N="141" REF="153"/>
he thought, he should, sooner than another have heard of them from the long acquaint∣ance between us: that, he was sure, my coming to court was to shew my duty, and that I desired to live in his favour, and, he supposed, that I might wish for his (Pelham's) protection and desire to come into his service: but that was guess only—the King replied, no, there has been too much of that already—and that the conversation did not end well. That he would tell me the bottom of all his poli∣ticks and his brother's too, for they must in the end be the same, and that was, to chuse a new Parliament, that should be all of a piece, such a one, as might serve the King if he lived, and be steady to put the young King in the right way, if the old one died:—that he meant a thorough Whig Parliament; for when there were factions, though a wise man was obliged to avail himself of them, as well as he could, yet they were not desirable, nor what he meant, but he wished to have a thorough Whig Parliament all of a piece. I replied, that I approved of what he said,
<PB N="142" REF="154"/>
and thought, that the offers I now made him, from myself and friends, might con∣tribute to facilitate that end—he said, it was for that end, that he told it to me. That they were, now, without competition, as well with the King as they could possi∣bly hope for: but that he was not so weak as to imagine that it depended upon any thing but the ease they procured his Ma∣jesty, in carrying on his service: that the King's temper was to be observed and com∣plied with, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>That, upon the present subject, he him∣self was most sincere and desirous to effect it, and would do his best, and he was sure his brother would do so too, and that he would write to him in conformity. That, as to borough matters, when he was pres∣sed about Weymouth (as, to be sure, both of us must expect,) he thought the best language he could hold was, that he and I lived very well together, and that he had no room to think, that any thing would be done there, that would be disagreeable o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="143" REF="155"/>
disserviceable to him; and that I should deal in the same general terms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I said, that, as to quitting the King's ser∣vice, I did not do it by any compact with the Prince, that it was full four months after, before his Royal Highness made me any offers, and he then did it in such a manner, that left me no option to re∣fuse, without offending him for ever. That Mr. Solicitor General Murray knew this; and that I had living and written evidence to prove it incontestably. Since I came into the Prince's service, I could appeal to him, whether my behaviour was not entirely calculated to soften, rather than to inflame, even to the loss of my fa∣vour; whether, when the little, incendiary system prevailed, by which alone many of those about his Royal Highness's person could ever be of any significance, I did not endeavour to check it, and when I could not, did not absent myself from the House, rather than take a part or countenance it. But, however, I desired the King should know, that I would not justify with my Sovereign and my master, but submitted
<PB N="144" REF="156"/>
myself to think that I was to blame, since he was displeased, and that I therefore humbly begged pardon, which was all in my power to do, except to shew him, by my future services, that I deserved it. That this, with the interest I could, and was willing to center in his Majesty's ser∣vice, I thought, might be sufficient to re∣move objections, (which had in reality no foundation) especially, when conveyed through so able, so powerful, and, I trusted, so friendly a channel. That, upon the whole, he might see, and, I meant, he should, that I was very desirous this event should take place, from a sincere wish to attach myself to him, and to end my life with those, with whom I began it. That I was desirous to serve my country, and chose to do it with the good liking of the King—but if his Majesty should shut up that way, that then I must endeavour to do it by such ways as should offer in the course of things. Mr. Pelham renewed the assurances of his sincere wishes and en∣deavours, in a very decent manner, and ad∣ded, that he was restrained from saying
<PB N="145" REF="157"/>
what he wished, out of the regard he owed me, not to say any thing he was not sure to perform, and concluded, by inviting himself in a most gentlemanlike and obliging manner, to Hammersmith.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="June"/>Mr. Verchaffelts dined here, and I paid him 100<HI>l.</HI> in part, for his statue.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="159"/>Went to town to meet Lord Middlesex and Counsellor Forrester. Lord Middle∣sex<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="July"/> gave me full power to make his sub∣mission, and to endeavour to reconcile him to his father. Owen tried, and acquitted, for publishing Mr. Murray's case. This is the third great case, where the juries have insisted on judging the matter of law, as well as of fact. The first was of Bushell, the Quaker, reported by Lord Chief Jus∣tice Vaughan: the second, was that of the Bishops in the reign of James the IId.</P>
<P>I waited on the Duke of Dorset. I<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="July"/> chose to put the question to him hypothe∣tically; if his son should throw himself at his feet, and declare an unreserved sub∣mission and sorrow for what is past—what would he do? He was much moved. I desired he would not answer me then, as I had no commission to demand it, but that he would consider of it, because, as the family were to come to me at East∣bury, if I should receive such commission, I should think it my duty both to him
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>
and his son, to lay it plainly before him, if it should be full and ample, as it ought to be.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="July"/>I went early to town to take my leave of Mr. Pelham. After a little general conversation, I rose to go away, and said that the Solicitor General had told me, that it was not only his own, but Mr. Pelham's opinion, that nothing of our af∣fair should be broken to the King, till his return from Hanover; and, therefore, I asked him no news. He replied, it was their opinion—that he had treated me with the utmost sincerity, and would con∣tinue to do so—that he sincerely wished the thing, and would do every thing to bring it about—that all reasons were for it—that he had told me the peculiarity of temper, the prejudices, &amp;c. that made things disagreeable, but that he would do his best. I replied, that, considering the name he bore, I could have no doubt of his sincerity, and therefore would patient∣ly wait the event. But that I thought, when, through a canal so favourable, the
<PB N="149" REF="161"/>
King was informed that, when I quitted his service, it was not by a bargain to en∣ter into the Prince's, and that I never made the Prince any proposition at all—that it was more than four months after my quit∣ing, that the Prince made me any. When his Majesty is desired to reflect, how much, when I came into the Prince's service, I endeavoured to bring a little temper and moderation into it, and when I could not succeed in that, I would not support the incendiary part, and therefore did not go to the House. That the Princess, the Solicitor General, and other living wit∣nesses, which I could produce, knew the first, and that I could appeal to himself (Pelham) for the truth of the last. But, setting all this aside, when his Majesty should be informed that I would not jus∣tify against my King and my master. That, since he was displeased, I was willing to think myself to blame, and humbly to de∣mand his pardon, assuring him that my future services should deserve it. Here I desired him to observe that, when a gen∣tleman asks pardon, he is with us entitled
<PB N="150" REF="162"/>
to it, and it was what I would not do, when I was in the right, to any subject in the world, or to any Prince, but himself. When his Majesty was assured that I was capable of facilitating his affairs, and that his chief servants were desirous of receiv∣ing me—</P>
<P>If all this, represented by those he did, and ought chiefly to rely on, would not do, I hoped Mr. Pelham would think, that I had discharged my humble duty to his Majesty, and shewed how desirous I was, of passing the rest of my life with him, and under his protection; for, I thought, I had said and done as much as any man of honour could do, or say, and had gone as far as was possible. Mr. Pelham said, that he understood me perfectly well, that he wished the thing cordially, and would do all imaginable justice and leave nothing, in his power, unattempted to persuade the King—that, in short, he had explained to me the bottom of his politicks—that he had a great regard for all Europe, but did not trouble himself much about it—
<PB N="151" REF="163"/>
that his concern was to keep things on a right foot at home—that if the King was willing to <HI>arrondir</HI> his affairs, and let them get together, as many as they could o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those, who could best contribute towards it, in order to go on as he was bred up, and suffer them to endeavour to have a thorough Whig Parliament chosen, which would make the remains of his Majesty's life easy, and would settle the young Prince upon the throne, so as to secure him a prospect of a prosperous reign. If <HI>they</HI> would let him do this, he was at their ser∣vice; if not, he could be contented to be a private man as well as another—not that he complained of the King, &amp;c. In short, here he spoke a little Pelham, but intelli∣gible enough to those who are acquainted with the language.</P>
<P>We parted very kindly.</P>
<P>By the Princess's commands I passed the<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July"/> day with her at Kew. I arrived there about eleven in the morning, and we passed two or three hours together, alone, in the gardens.
<PB N="152" REF="164"/>
I informed her, by her order, of the state of the Irish affairs, which had made so much noise. She asked me about a report she had heard concerning a reconciliation between the Duke of Dorset and Lord Middlesex. I said, it would be impracti∣cable, unless Lord Middlesex would en∣tirely submit to his father; and even then, his behaviour had made the wound so deep, that I could not be answerable what the Duke would do. She seemed desirous of it, and wished I would try. I told her that, as Lord and Lady Middlesex were to be with me, in the country, I would see what his Lordship could be brought to, for from thence only it could move, if at all. I opened myself no far∣ther to her. We came in, an hour before dinner. I dined at the Bed-chamber wo∣man's table, where was Mr. Cresset, who behaved very courteously to me, and is a very knowing man. After dinner, her Royal Highness sent for me: we walked round Richmond Gardens: she was at∣tended by the Ladies Augusta and Eliza∣beth, Messrs. Cresset and Bludworth.
<PB N="153" REF="165"/>
When we returned, she ordered me to come in with her: we sat down, and she turned the discourse upon the ministry. I soon perceived she had heard something of the late correspondence between Mr. Pelham and me; I therefore thought it fit to tell her that, from an opportunity which had arisen from them, I had lately renewed my correspondence with them, and that I had taken occasion to tell them, that I was desirous of ending my life, in quiet, with those with whom I had began it, and whom I most esteemed, &amp;c. That they received my offers of friendship very civilly, and seemed desirous of receiving me; but that they apprehended the prejudices of the King against me, from the honour I had of belonging to the Prince, &amp;c. That the answer I made, was that my inclinations were sincere, as, I supposed, their kind acceptance was also; and that, for the rest, I must leave it to them. I then put her in mind, that I never asked any thing of his Royal Highness; that he never promised any thing to me, till four months after I had quitted my employment; and
<PB N="154" REF="166"/>
that I, then, testified my surprise to her, and acquainted her with all that passed. She said, she remembered it very well. I then reminded her, how, from my appear∣ance as a servant at Cliefden, I formed a plan of temper and moderation: that, knowing her right way of thinking, I ventured to communicate the plan to her, and beg'd her protection, in the execution of it, even before we returned to town— that I always had persisted in it, and never would engage in any other. She replied, it was very true; she was a very good witness of it, and would always as∣sert it, &amp;c. I asked leave to wait on her at Kew, if she should be there at my re∣turn, which she gave me in a very obliging manner, and then I came home to Ham∣mersmith by ten at night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="July"/>At half past three, without going to bed, Mrs. Dodington and I set out in our post-chaise for Eastbury, where we arri∣ved the same day, at six in the afternoon.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Sept."/>Messrs. Dodington, Ralph, and I went
<PB N="155" REF="167"/>
to Poole, to poll for a Sheriff and Mayor. We lost both elections, and I think Mr. Trenchard's election in danger.</P>
<P>We returned to Hammersmith.<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Sept."/></P>
<P>Went to Mr. Pelham's. He gave me<MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Sept."/> an account of Earl Poulett's correspon∣dence with him, about the vacancy at Bridgewater. I mentioned, that I had written to his Lordship, to make it a means of reconciling the family. He seemed much indisposed towards Mr. Vere. There was company, and so we could not talk fully. At council, there was nothing to do but to prorogue the Parliament, and issue a proclamation for a Scotch Peer, on the death of the Duke of Gordon.</P>
<P>Went to town to meet the Duke of<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."/> Dorset, I made his son's submissions to him, and endeavoured to procure a full reconciliation. We had a long confe∣rence. He alledged the many, almost un∣pardonable provocations, which I know to be true; but did not absolutely refuse
<PB N="156" REF="168"/>
to forgive him. He boggled much at the freeing his son from his debts, and said that nothing but his distresses drove him to think of his duty, and therefore, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expected some actions, to convince him o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his sincerity. To this I said that, as to enumerating provocations, I thought ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most rational point was to look for reason<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to forgive, instead of materials to continu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the quarrel. That as to paying the debts I wished it was come to that, for I coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make that circumstance very practicable▪ As to the motives of his son's repentance I allowed them; but he must allow tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were, too often, the same with thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of us all to our common father, to whom we were more obliged, than we could b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our natural parent—That God accepte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our repentance, though grounded on dis¦tress: should <HI>we</HI> then refuse it when offere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to us? As to actions, what should they be?—would he please to subscribe. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was matter of some difficulty; and as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conversation had been very long, we agree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to meet again, to consider if any tem¦perament can be found. I greatly doub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="157" REF="169"/>
it: but if Lord Middlesex would help himself—though I think he will not— it might succeed.</P>
<P>I went to town to see Mr. Pelham, and<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Oct."/> laid before him the utility of his taking the occasion of Mr. Poulett's death, to make up the quarrel between the Earl and his brothers, by chusing Mr. Vere Poulett in his place. Mr. Pelham would not enter into it, as Mr. Vere had left them unhand∣somely, and had treated him ill, personally wherever he could be heard. He was in∣deed for the union of the family, but he would have nothing to do with Mr. Vere, from his personal behaviour, though he could very well live and treat with those who opposed, and even personally opposed him; which, considering those he has about him, was, I thought, saying in ef∣fect, that he would take a blow from a strong man, but not from a weak one. He then said, that they knew nothing positive as to the King's coming; but should know by the next courier, whether he designed to go to Hanover the next year. For that he had written to his brother, to beg to know
<PB N="158" REF="170"/>
of his Majesty, whether he would have the Parliament meet before, or after Christ∣mas. We touched upon the subsidies at∣tending the election of a King of the Ro∣mans: Mr. Pelham's face fell, and he grew very uneasy upon it, and expressed much dislike at the way it was conducted. He said, he was always against these sub∣sidies; that his idea was, that, if the dis∣senting electors would give in the ultima∣tum of their demands, and perform the conditions before they received the re∣ward, then, indeed, when we were sure of our bargain, it might be worth considering if it were prudent to pay the price: but, to be buying one elector after another, was what he abhorred and could not ap∣prove of. It must have an end—he had declared so in Parliament, and, as I was not present at the debate, he would tell me what he said, for he found that he had been misrepresented. I told him, that I had heard from many quarters how he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> understood; that though I was satisfied that he said nothing but what was proper yet, whatever was the general acceptatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="159" REF="171"/>
was worth attending to: I continued, that it was allowed on all hands, that he de∣clared against the subsidies in general, but that he was for the present demand, as it was to be the last, and as he had good rea∣son to think, it would certainly attain the end: that it was, by somebody, fastened upon him, who, rejecting all that others had said, declared that he voted for them, singly on the assurances given by him. Mr. Pelham replied, Who? Pitt? I said No; I thought it was Mr. Fox. He re∣peated, in a low voice; Oh, Fox! with great signs of uneasiness and discomposure, and in that situation I left him.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Cresset, that<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Oct."/> her Royal Highness would see me this morning. I made haste to dress, and got to Kew by half an hour after eleven. I saw her Royal Highness very soon: she, the Ladies Augusta, Elizabeth, and I went out, and we walked, without sitting down, for near three hours. We had much talk upon all manner of private subjects, serious and ludicrous Her behaviour was open,
<PB N="160" REF="172"/>
friendly, and unaffected. She commanded me to dine, and to pass the afternoon with her. When we came in, we met Lady Middlesex, who had sent me word she was to be there. We walked in the af∣ternoon till it was dark. As we came in, she said, that she had a petition from the Prince, that we would play at comet, of which he was very fond. The party was the Princess, the Prince of Wales, Prince Edward, the Ladies Augusta and Eliza∣beth, Ladies Middlesex and Charlotte Ed∣win, and myself.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Oct."/>I received an account from Bridgewater that, at the Mayor's feast, Mr. Balch, who was present, was declared candidate to succeed Mr. Poulett. I sent an abstract of the letter, with one of my own, to Mr. Pelham.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Oct."/>Saw Mr. Pelham, and spoke to him about this sudden event at Bridgewater. He agreed that it was wholly Earl Pou∣lett's fault, in not determining and recom∣mending somebody sooner. He seemed
<PB N="161" REF="173"/>
to be well enough satisfied, from the cha∣racter I had given him of Mr. Balch.</P>
<P>The Princess having sent to desire me<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Oct."/> to pass this day with her, I waited on her accordingly between eleven and twelve. I saw her immediately; her Royal High∣ness, the children, and Lady Charlotte Edwin went walking till two, and then returned to prayers, from thence to dinner. As soon as dinner was over, she sent for me, and we sat down to comet. We rose from play about nine: the royal children retired, and the Princess called me to the farther end of the room, and the two la∣dies (Lady Charlotte Edwin and Lady Howe) who were to sup with her, re∣mained at the other end. She began by saying, that she liked the Prince should, now and then, amuse himself at small play, but that Princes should never play deep, both for the example, and because it did not become them to win great sums. From thence, she told me, that it was highly improper, the manner in which he Princess **** behaved at Bath; that

she played, publickly, all the evening very deep. I asked with whom? She said, with the Duke and Dutchess of Bedford: that it was prodigious what work she made with Lord Chesterfield: that, when his Lordship was at court, she would hardly speak to him, at least, as little as was pos∣sible to a man of his rank; but that now, at Bath, she sent to enquire of his coming before he arrived; and when he came, she sent her compliments of expecting him at all her parties at play; and that he should always sit by her in the publick rooms, that he might be sure of a warm place, &amp;c. I asked her, how these demonstrations with him and the Bedfords, were to be repre∣sented to the King? She said, she did not understand it. That, the Duke of Bedford, when he went out, treated the Duke of Newcastle very ill to the King, not only as to publick, but to private matters with relation to Lord Gower: but that, some time afterwards, in the summer, the Duke of Bedford relented, and asked an audience, when he unsaid great part of what he had said before (and on which account the
<PB N="163" REF="175"/>
King had been very much displeased with the Duke of Newcastle) and attributed it to misinformation. I asked her, if that could be so? She replied, she was sure of it, and knew it to be true. I observed to her, that, notwithstanding this, in the winter, his Grace (of Bedford) made a formal at∣tack, and a very strong one too, in the House of Lords, against the Saxon subsidy. She said, it was true, and that then the King was again very angry, and told <HI>her</HI> that the Duke of Bedford did not know his own mind. She herself, indeed, had no opinion of his judgment, but said, that he was governed by Lord Sandwich, of whom she did not think very well; that he had made the Duke resign, and that they were, both, very much combined, and in intimate correspondence with the Duke of Cumberland. How they mana∣ged with the King, she did not know, but she thought that they did not mean to act, at least, to any purpose now: that <HI>their</HI> views were upon the minority. I said that, in this light, it seemed highly im∣prudent in the Duke of Bedford to resign
<PB N="164" REF="176"/>
his office, which office gave him a settled place in the Council of Regency. She answered, it was very true—it was Lord Sandwich's doing—but that she was satis∣fied the minority was their point of action I said, that it was necessary for her Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Highness to look about her a little, and to secure friends in whom she could trust, to see that justice was done unto her in that event, not only from that quarter, but from all quarters, for she must have observed, that the present government had taken the best care, they could, to secure themselves. She said. Yes, good folks! they had not neglected themselves; and she would act as I had hinted, not only for her own sake, but the sake of her son and of the nation. I said that, not know∣ing what part her Royal Highness would take in the regency bill, I had prepared myself to oppose it: that I should have opposed it in a very different manner from those, who meddled with it: that I would have opposed it upon principles, that should have made the King himself weary of the bill, not as an opposition to his
<PB N="165" REF="177"/>
Majesty and his ministers, but as a measure of his ministers to secure their own power at the expence, and in the diminution of the power of the Crown: and I did believe, that, with the assistance I was sure of, I could have hung upon the bill so long, and have shewn it in such lights, that, at last, the King should have been out of humour with it before it passed, as I had reason to believe he was, since. That, however, when I found, that she took the party of acquiescence, which upon con∣sideration (though I thought, I should hardly have had the prudence to advise the measure) I was thoroughly convinced was much the most wise and adviseable mode that could be t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, that, then, I dropped all shew of opposition and did not go to the House, that I might not fur∣nish an handle to render me obnoxious: t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the same view in the late tran∣saction between Mr. Pelham and me, I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de ten steps to their one, so that if nothing came of it, they could not say, that I was desirous to continue and propa∣gate resentments, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178"/>That, I thought, the persons, now in power, extremely proper for her to go on with in case of a minority, and all, that I meant by mentioning the regency bill, was to shew, that, as they had taken all proper precautions for their own security, it might not be unreasonable that her Royal Highness should keep a look out, and secure such friends, who, though they acted with government, might see that she had her due share of it; for that there was such a thing as being great, and at the same time inconsiderable; that we might be born the one, but must owe our con∣sequence to ourselves. That, however, nothing was to be done at present, but to sit still and watch events: that all was very well, that the King was very kind to the royal children, and very respectful to her, &amp;c.</P>
<P>She said, that, in general, she had no ob∣jection to the Ministry—she, indeed, saw very little of them: but, what she could not excuse them for or forgive, was their not doing something for the Prince's ser∣vants▪
<PB N="167" REF="179"/>
that, after so long a time and so many vacancies, taking no notice of any one of them looked, as if they had a studi∣ed design to keep old prejudices and resent∣ments alive: That she was sure, they might assist them if they would; that they might have prevailed on the King before now, if they had set about it willingly: could they pretend, they could not pre∣vail with him in behalf of persons who must be indifferent to the King, after what they had made him do for Pitt? I replied, that I agreed to all she said, with relation to their influence over his Majesty, where reason was so evidently on their side, and I was the more flattered with it, because it was my own way of thinking, so much that, if nothing should come of what was in agitation between me and them, and they should continue to hold up the King's personal indisposition towards me, I should impute it wholly to their want of inclina∣tion. She said that, notwithstanding what I had mentioned of the King's kindness to the children and civility to her, those things did not impose upon her—that
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>
there were other things which she could not get over—she wished the King was less civil, and that he put less of <HI>their</HI> money into his own pocket: that he got full 30,000<HI>l. per annum</HI> by the poor Prince's death—if he would but have given them the Dutchy of Cornwall to have paid his debts, it would have been something. Should resentments be carried beyond the grave? Should the innocent suffer? Was it becoming so great a King to leave his son's debts unpaid? and such inconsidera∣ble debts? I asked her, what she thought they might amount to? she answered, she had endeavoured to know as near as a per∣son could properly enquire, who, not hav∣ing it in her power, could not pretend to pay them. She thought, that to the trades∣men and servants they did not amount to 90,000<HI>l.</HI> that there was some money ow∣ing to the Earl of Scarborough, and that there was, abroad, a debt of about 70,000<HI>l.</HI> That this hurt her exceedingly, though she did not shew it. I said that it was impossible to new-make people—the King could not, now, be altered, and that it ad∣ded
<PB N="169" REF="181"/>
much to the prudence of her conduct, her taking no notice of it. She said, she could not however bear it, nor help, some∣times, giving the King to understand her, in the strongest and most disagreeable light. She had done it more than once, and she would tell me how it happened the last time. You know, continued she, that the Crown has a power of resumption of Carle∣ton House and gardens for a certain sum: the King had, not long since, an inclina∣tion to see them, and he came to make me a visit there: we walked in the gardens, and he, seeming mightily pleased with them, commended them much and told me that he was extremely glad, I had got so very pretty a place: I replied, it was a pretty place, but that the prettiness of a place was an objection to it, when one was not sure to keep it. The King said, that there was, indeed, a power of resumption in the Crown for 4000<HI>l.</HI> but surely, I could not imagine that it could ever he made use of against me! how could such a thought come into my head? I answered, no, it was not that which I was afraid of, but I
<PB N="170" REF="182"/>
was afraid there were those who had a bet∣ter right to it, than either the Crown or I: He said, oh, no, no, I do not understand that; that cannot be. I replied, I did not pretend to understand those things, but I was afraid there were such people. He said, oh! I know nothing of that—I do not understand it—and immediately turned the discourse. I was pleased with the ingenuity of the attack, but could not help smiling at the defence, nor she either, when she told it. I said that, I thought, she had done all that could be expected; that prudence required letting this and se∣veral other matters sleep: that I was con∣vinced, that the high and just opinion people had of her, made them wait with patience. She said, they were very good to her; that George had no other way of thinking, and would, certainly, act accor∣dingly; but yet, she durst not let any body have the comfort of knowing it, least they should put every thing into a flame: upon which, she observed to me the delicacy and ticklishness of her situation. I, then, took the liberty to ask her, what she thought
<PB N="171" REF="183"/>
the real disposition of the Prince to be?— She said, that I knew him almost as well as she did; that he was very honest, but she wished that he was a little more for∣ward, and less childish, at his age; that she hoped his preceptors would improve him. I beg'd to know what methods they took; what they read to him, or made him read; and whether he shewed a par∣ticular inclination to any of the people a∣bout him. She said, she really did not well know what they taught him; but, to speak freely, she was afraid not much: that they were in the country and followed their diversions, and not much else that she could discover; that we must hope, it would be better when we came to town. I said, that I did not much regard books, that what I the most wished was, that his Royal Highness should begin to learn the usages and knowledge of the world; be informed of the general frame and nature of this government and constitution, and of the general course and manner of busi∣ness, without his descending into minutias. She said, she was of my opinion, and
<PB N="172" REF="184"/>
that Stone told her, that, when he talked to the Prince upon those subjects, he seem∣ed to give a proper attention and made pertinent remarks: that Stone was a sen∣sible man, and capable of instructing in things, as well as in books: that Lord Harcourt and the Prince agreed very well, but she thought, that he could not learn much from his Lordship: that Scott, in her opinion, was a very proper preceptor: but that for the good Bishop, he might be, and she supposed he was, a mighty learned man, but he did not seem to her very pro∣per to convey knowledge to children; he had not that clearness which she thought necessary; she did not very well compre∣hend him, herself, his thoughts seemed to be too many for his words. That she did not observe the Prince to take very parti∣cularly to any body about him, but to his brother Edward, and she was very glad of it, for the young people of quality were so ill educated and so very vicious, that they frightened her. I told her, I thought it a great happiness, that he shewed no dispo∣sition to any great excesses, and beg'd to
<PB N="173" REF="185"/>
know what were his affections and pas∣sions. She repeated that he was a very honest boy, and that his chief passion seem∣ed to be for Edward. I said that, as her Royal Highness had mentioned the nega∣tive which the ministry seemed to continue upon the Prince's friends, I presumed to ask her about the young Prince's affections towards his father's memory; because he was, now, bred in a manner, and in hands so totally unacquainted with the late Prince, and with those who had been about him, that he might very easily be brought to forget them; which, I feared, at the first setting out in life, would give a very disadvantageous, if not a dangerous impression of him: that trifles are of con∣sequence in the first outset (particularly those that relate to the heart) to Princes, whose lightest actions engage the attention, and whose elevation exposes them to the continual inspection of mankind: that many good things lose their gloss at least by untoward impressions: that a great deal of power might be required to do things, where affection and confidence
<PB N="174" REF="186"/>
were wanted, which a very little might bring about, where they were once esta∣blished by first and favourable impressions. That, for these reasons, I should be ex∣tremely sorry that his Royal Highness should entirely forget those, who had been faithfully attached to his father, as that attachment was the only reason that could be given to justify the proscription which they, now, lie under. She said, that she agreed with me, that nothing could be more disadvantageous and hurtful to him: that it would affect her very sensibly; that she had no reason to apprehend it, as the Prince seemed to have a very tender regard for the memory of his father, and that she encouraged it as much as she could: that when they behaved wrong, or idly (as children will do) to any that belonged to the late Prince, and who are, now, about her; she always asked them how they thought their father would have liked to see them behave so to any body that be∣longed to him, and whom he valued; and that they ought to have the more kindness for them, because they had lost their friend
<PB N="175" REF="187"/>
and protector, who was theirs also; and she said, she found that it made a proper impression upon them. I humbly beg'd that she would cultivate and improve the personal influence, which her many vir∣tues, as well as natural affection gave her over the Prince: that I was sure, that, from her influence, and the settled opinion of her prudence with all mankind, all the disinterested and sensible amongst us, hoped for a happy settlement of the new reign: that I did not mean authoritavely and during a legal minority, but during the very young part of the King's life, and till time and inclination had brought him thoroughly to weigh and understand what the government of a great country was. She expressed herself civilly for the regard I testified for her, and said she could have nothing so much at heart as to see him do well, and make the nation happy. N. B. I have forgotten something very particular, <HI>viz.</HI> In expressing her dislike to the Prin∣cess A—a and the Duke of Cumberland, she said, that, though she did not value those things, nor seem to see them, yet
<PB N="176" REF="188"/>
she could not but wonder at the very lit∣tle regard which the Duke was pleased to to shew her. That she had been at Kew the whole summer, and he had neve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vouchsafed to favour her with one visit. That she had been ill for three weeks, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much, indeed, but so that the town re∣ports were, that she was dying; but his Royal Highness never thought her worth sending after, even once, to know how she did: she continued, that she was very indifferent to these matters, but she could not help wondering what views were at the bottom of it. I came home between ten and eleven, and have been the more particular in this conversation, because it carries an air of friendship and openness, which I, no way, expected from a great lady, who has established a character for prudence in not opening herself much to any body, and of great caution to whom she opens herself at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Oct."/>I saw Lord Middlesex, and had a long talk with him in presence of Lady Middle∣sex; and in the evening I sent him a
<PB N="177" REF="189"/>
draught of a letter from him to the Duke of Dorset, which he will not send, nor do any thing, I believe, for himself: if so, he will render it impossible for me to do any thing for him.</P>
<P>I went to town with design to go to the<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Oct."/> Prince's drawing-room in black, being in mourning for the Countess Temple. After a little time, the Earl of Hyndford was so obliging as to come and tell me, that, he believed, I had forgotten that they did not appear in mourning that day, it being the coronation-day. So I was forced to slip away. I spoke to the Solicitor Gene∣ral to consider, how I was to open the transaction, between Mr. Pelham and me, to the Duke of Newcastle.</P>
<P>I received my draught from Lord Mid∣dlesex,<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Oct."/> with a letter in a good degree con∣formable to it, from him to the Duke of Dorset. Sent him a draught of another to his mother, the Dutchess.</P>
<P>I dined with the Lord Mayor. No<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Nov."/>
<PB N="178" REF="190"/>
counsellors, but those of the law, except the Speaker and myself.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Nov."/>Called at the Duke of Dorset's, and de∣livered a letter to him, and another for the Dutchess, from Lord Middlesex. Much conversation to induce a relation, but could not obtain a declaration of the conditions on which he would be reconciled. He objected to the usage he had received, in which he was too well grounded; and next, to the incapacity he was under of paying his son's debts. I told him we were not come to that yet—I wished we were, as I could point out means very easily, to shew that those debts were not so formidable, &amp;c.—I hinted some. We were now interrupted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Nov."/>The King came to town about five o'clock.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Nov."/>I called at the Speaker's, and proposed, upon supposition he was in the chair of the new Parliament, Dr. Sharpe for his chaplain. I received a general answer of
<PB N="179" REF="191"/>
regard for me, and esteem for the Doctor. I think, I find that he will be Speaker, and I hope, he will get some reversion for his son as an inducement for him.</P>
<P>Went to the Duke of Newcastle, who<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Nov."/> received me with very much kindness. I kissed the King's hand.</P>
<P>I waited on the Princess, and gave her<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Nov."/> a full account of the transaction about a reconciliation in the Dorset family. She received it with great pleasure, and treated me with uncommon condescension.</P>
<P>Mons. Lamberti, the French agent,<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Nov."/> called on me. He insisted that the King must go to Hanover early in the spring— that the election of a King of the Romans was the thing next his heart—that, by the Golden Bull, <HI>absolute unanimity</HI> of the Electoral College, as also of that of <HI>the Princes</HI>, was required—that, upon those conditions, and satisfaction to her allies, (the Palatine and Prussia) France would not oppose it; but that she would, without
<PB N="180" REF="192"/>
that satisfaction—that the pecuniary sa∣tisfaction of 1,200,000 florins, and the barony to the Palatine, was settled, but the expectation of Ortenaw was not—that, when Bavaria left France for the House of Austria, the recompence was fixed by the treaty of Fussen; that we engaged for the performance—that a private treaty was since signed by the Duke of Newcastle, Messrs. Munchausen and Haslang, by which we further engaged to make it good—that the Bavarian subsidy was to be augmented— that, of Cologne to be settled. I asked why all these things might not be nego∣ciated at London, as well as at Hanover: he replied, because the ministers, who treated those affairs there, did not come hither—that these were another sort of men, men of business and abilities, wholly bred for negociations, and not for charac∣ters and show—that the German Princes also sent thither their confidents and mi∣nisters of state, who never came to London as resident Envoys—that nothing farther of effect could be done here, this winter, in that matter, and that all the negoications
<PB N="181" REF="193"/>
would be with France about the limits in America; and, as to that, they had cart loads of memorials to exchange with us, whenever we pleased.</P>
<P>King's birth-day kept. Lord Hillsbo∣rough<MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Nov."/> began a conversation with me at court. He thought there must be some disturbance arise from the Pitt party: that, though they were so well placed, they were still uneasy: that they neither liked others, nor were liked by them. I said, I could not conceive that they would stir. He said, yes; for that Pitt's passion was ambition, not avarice—that he was at a full stop, as things were, and could have no hopes of going farther: he was once popular; and if he could again make a disturbance, and get the country on his side, he then might have hopes: now, and on the present system, he could have none. I replied, I thought they could not part with what they had, &amp;c. &amp;c. He said, they had the Temple pocket—that, to his know∣ledge, they were all as one, and would stand and fall with Pitt, as their head.
<PB N="182" REF="194"/>
Lord Hillsborough wondered that they did not break out; he daily expected it. I said, that, in all likelihood, if such a scheme was on foot, his Lordship would know it as soon as any body; for he must be sensi∣ble, that it was impossible for them to at∣tempt it, without holding out a hand to people, to extend and fortify their own connections, &amp;c. He said, to be sure, but not to him—that they knew his opinions too well—that, when they broke from me, he followed me—that he never was more than commonly acquainted with Pitt—that Pitt had once dined at his house, and they might visit perhaps once in a winter—that his Lordship loved George Grenville perso∣nally, but no ways espoused his politicks: that, for himself indeed, his alliance with Lord Kildare naturally led him to Mr. Fox, and that he was much more likely to suc∣ceed than Pitt—that the Pitts could not be quiet, but had been dabbling with the Prince, and that their plans were pre∣vented by the Prince's death, as, to be sure, I knew, and Mr. Pelham knew: therefore they must be disagreeable to each other,
<PB N="183" REF="195"/>
and they could have no hopes of rising by him. That Mr. Fox had something very frank and open about him, and that he re∣solved to push for his turn—not by oppo∣sition, for he had a family, and could not afford to part with his emoluments; but, if accidents should happen, he pretended to succeed—that, indeed, Mr. Pelham's life was as good as his, and he would not oppose him; but that he should endeavour to be next, and would consider himself as such. I asked, whether he held out his hand, &amp;c. His Lordship said, yes, to all the world; that it was prodigious how many friends he had made. He had got the Duke of Cumberland, the Dukes of Marlborough and Bedford, Lord Sandwich and the Duke of Richmond of course. That he was very well with Lord Halifax, who seemed to trim, as near as he could, between Mr. Pelham and him, and that now he was endeavouring to get Lord Hartington. That if Mr. Pelham was out of the way, he thought that the Duke of Newcastle did not like Fox personally, nor did the Chancellor. As to Pitt, the King
<PB N="184" REF="196"/>
himself would be against him. But, said he, I think you are not acquainted with Fox, I replied, that I had always known him, and always liked him very well, but had not conversed much with him of late. He said, he wondered at it, and what should be the reason of it. I said, that I fancied it was occasioned by the other side, for though I liked Mr. Fox very well, it was possible he might not much like me. He said, he could not believe it. I said, some lies might probably be told him, but that, I had never deserved ill of him; if it was so, his opinion of me must be, and ought to be, extremely indifferent to me. He said, he had never heard any thing drop from him of that kind, and if he had any dislike to me, it must be from my pushing Sir Robert Walpole, for Fox really loved that man. I said, surely my breaking with Sir Robert Walpole was nothing personal to him; I did it pub∣lickly, at the expence of a considerable employment, and what Mr. Fox thought of it was, what never did, nor ever could give me any the least concern. Then the
<PB N="185" REF="197"/>
conversation became general, the beginning of which I thought very singular.</P>
<P>I went to the Duke of Dorset and ob∣tained<MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Nov."/> of him, that he would willingly see Lord Middlesex, on condition that he would form no pretention to have his debts paid, or to a seat in Parliament, or to a place. I took this down in writing, but I doubt Lord Middlesex will not go: if he does, and resolves to continue to use all his advantages, he will succeed. But it must be the work of time, perseverance, and insinuation.</P>
<P>I delivered the Duke of Dorset's mes∣sage<MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="Nov."/> to Lord Middlesex, and gave him an account of the conversation; I then said what I thought was proper.</P>
<P>Lord Harcourt resigned being Governor<MILESTONE N="5." UNIT="Dec."/> to the Prince. He offered to do so, unless Mr. Stone (placed as Sub-governor by the ministers), Mr. Scott, tutor in the late Prince's time (but recommended by Lord Bolingbroke) and Mr. Cresset, made trea∣surer
<PB N="186" REF="198"/>
by the Princess's recommendation, were removed. The King desired him to consider of it; but Lord Harcourt con∣tinuing in the same resolution, the Arch∣bishop and Lord Chancellor were sent to him, to know the particulars of his com∣plaints against those gentlemen. He re∣plied, that the particulars were fit only to be communicated to the King, and ac∣cordingly he waited on his Majesty, which ended in his resignation. The Bishop of Norwich sent his resignation by the same Prelate and Lord. His reasons, if he gave any, I should have known, if a gen∣tleman, who was going to tell me, had not been interrupted by company.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Dec."/>The Duke of Dorset came to tell me that Lord Middlesex had written to the Dutchess for leave to wait on her, and that she had appointed to-morrow morning. I hope all will, in time, end well.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Dec."/>Lord Middlesex informed me that he had seen the Duke and Dutchess of Dorset; that he was very coldly received by the
<PB N="187" REF="199"/>
Dutchess, and not much better by them both together. This is very injudicious in their Graces, but his Lordship must persevere.</P>
<P>Mr. Pelham sent for Cary, the surgeon,<MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Dec."/> on pretence of the Westminster election, but, in reality, to question him about a letter which he had written to Mr. Vane, and which Mr. Vane had sent to Mr. Pel∣ham, who interpreted it to insinuate, that I was out of humour because nothing was settled or said to me. Mr. Pelham said, I must know how much this squabble with Lord Harcourt had engrossed their whole time and thought, and in a disagree∣able manner. That they could not be <HI>throwing at</HI> the King every day—that he had the greatest kindness and esteem for me, and that a proper person should shortly speak to me.</P>
<P>Went to the Duke of Dorset, and, I<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Dec."/> think, left him disposed to receive his son kindly. I saw Lord Middlesex, who, I hope, will make a proper use of all oppor∣tunities.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="200"/>Lord Waldegrave declared Governor to <MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Dec."/>the Prince, and on the 20th, was sworn of the council.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Dec."/>Was with the Duke of Dorset. We talked over the affair of the Prince's family, and agreed that there must be a counter story of the court side, or the resigners would run away with the publick opinion. I left him, still, well disposed to his son.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Dec."/>I waited on the Princess: she was pleased to send the royal children to prayers, and to stay with me. I resolved to avoid men∣tioning all publick affairs, on account of the disturbances, now fresh, in the Prince of Wales's family, and therefore, I began by acquainting her with what had passed, relating to the reconciliation in the Dorset family, since I had seen her Royal High∣ness. She said, she was afraid it would be hard to compleat it so, as to answer Lord Middlesex's ends entirely; and she seemed to be of opinion, that, though Lady Mid∣dlesex was no ways in fault, and though neither the Duke nor the Dutchess had
<PB N="189" REF="201"/>
dropt the least word about her, and though Lord George had been with Lady Middle∣sex twice, in the same house with her, and never once saw, or asked after her, yet she was inclined to think, that Lady Middle∣sex should go to wait on the Dutchess. I was glad to learn her opinion, for I wanted to know it. I replied, that there were odd∣nesses about them, which were peculiar to that family, and I had often told them so. She said, there was something very odd amongst them, and laughing, added, that she knew but one family that was more odd, and she would not name that family for the world. I said, it did not become me to guess at her Royal Highness; but if it did, I was sure I could not guess it in a hun∣dred years. She laughed and said, <HI>à propos</HI>, there has been fine doings in our family; a very fine bustle indeed! I am glad we are rid of them. I said, it had indeed oc∣casioned a great deal of talk. She replied, she was quite weary of hearing it—that there was such an outcry at two people's leaving them, as if they were the most considerable men in the nation; and who
<PB N="190" REF="202"/>
occasioned as much wonder and outcry two years ago, when they came to them on account of their being too unknown to come thither—that she knew nothing of the jacobitism, the arbitrary principles, the dangerous notions of those who were accused, or any such, attempted to be in∣stilled into the children—that she could not conceive what they meant—that the Bishop, indeed, was teaching them logick, which, as she was told, was a very odd study for children of their age, not to say, of their condition. I said that, whatever they meant, they both must often, before things came to these extremities, have applied to her Royal Highness, and have laid before her some ostensible reasons, at least, for a ground for their resolution to resign, when the King returned. She re∣plied, never!—that she knew nothing of their intention, till Lord Harcourt had been with the King—that the Bishop had, several times, given her an account of the progress the children made—that he be∣haved in the most stattering and servile manner, in the accounts he gave, and then
<PB N="191" REF="203"/>
he often insinuated, that there were those about the Prince, who encouraged his Royal Highness against him, &amp;c.—that she told him, as the truth was, that she was entirely innocent of any such practices her∣self, and did not know of any body who could be accused of it; and particularly, could not perceive by the children, when they were with her, that any ill offices had been done him—that the last time the Bishop had been with her, he complained more strongly of being disregarded; he beg'd her protection, shewing the great ne∣cessity of a preceptor's being respected and supported, &amp;c. Upon which she told him, that she always inculcated in the children to shew him great respect, and was very far from endeavouring, or even wishing, that it should be lessened: and this, says she, not for love of you, my Lord, but be∣cause it is fitting and necessary; for if they are suffered to want respect that is due to one degree, they will proceed to want it to another, till, at last, it would come up to me, and I should then have taught them to disregard me. This, she said, was the
<PB N="192" REF="204"/>
last conversation she had with the Bishop. I asked her, if she could remember when it was: she answered, she thought about the end of September, or soon in October. That, as to Lord Harcourt, he never took the least notice of her; that she had hardly seen him, three times, the whole summer, though they lived so near together at Kew: that, when he came for the Prince, so far from sending in, to her, he would stay in the hall; and though pressed to it by the servants, he would not come into the pic∣ture-room, where we always sat, when she was above, till she came to us or sent for us up. I asked, if he always fetched the Prince home: she said, yes; at a certain hour. I said, I had heard so, and did, in∣deed, a little wonder in myself, that I had never seen Lord Harcourt, when I had the honour to play at cards with their Royal Highnesses in private; for as the game could not be up to a moment, I thought it natural his Lordship should let his Royal Highness know that he was below, and I presumed she would, as naturally, send for him up: she said, to be sure she should;
<PB N="193" REF="205"/>
and I might well wonder. But so far from that, he never came near her: that he had been twice this year in Oxfordshire, and that she never knew when he went, or when he returned: I then said, that I could not conceive, according to the com∣mon form of things, even though his re∣solution might be taken, how it was pos∣sible that he could avoid waiting upon her, to lay some reasons before her Royal High∣ness, by way of expostulation or apology, before the King came home: she said, he never did, nothing like it: that, since his return from Oxfordshire, the very first time she saw him, was at the foot of the stairs at St. James's, the night the King came (Nov. 18); that the next time, was the birth-day (27th) in the private rooms, that he endeavoured to avoid her, but she got between the door and him, and took him by the coat, and said, he was very fine: he said, Madam, it is all she manufacture of Spitalfields, and so walked off. That, the Tuesday before, he had been with the King, to represent that her children were in the way of imbi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing dangerous no∣tions,
<PB N="194" REF="206"/>
&amp;c. That he had no authority, and could do no good, unless Stone, Cresset, and Scott were dismissed; that they were Jacobites, &amp;c. and had been bred so, they and their families. I said, this charge upon their families and education made me smile; for that, though I had a per∣sonal regard for Lord Harcourt, and did stedfastly believe, that he was as faithful a servant and subject, as any the present fa∣mily on the Throne had: yet I was sorry to say, that I remembered his predecessor, following the Oxford circuit, a very poor, but reckoned a very shrewd lawyer; which shrewdness in the poor professor, as he rose, had justice done it, and was called genius and abilities, as it really was, for he was very able, very skilful, and more eminent by his talents and capacity than by his post. But, till the last years of his life, he was always esteemed a thorough Jacobite: he even stands impeached upon these princi∣ciples, and though not proceeded against, he is excepted in several acts of grace. That I was sure, Lord Harcourt abhorred those principles, and would, with chear∣fulness,
<PB N="195" REF="207"/>
risque every thing for this royal family; but I thought it strange that peo∣ple should not allow conversion to be as natural and sincere in other families, as we had happily experienced it in his; and that, upon the whole, I could not imagine what they meant by this whole transac∣tion, as to the matter, and yet less, as to the manner. She said, that, however it was, the King was very well pleased with them; but that she could easily guess what they meant. I said, that now I was se∣rious in assuring her Royal Highness that I could not guess. She replied, one might guess by their falling upon Mr. Cresset, who had no more to do with the Prince's education, than I had—that they had a design to get his place for another, and she thought it was for Lord Talbot's brother; but as the King took her recommendation, now Cresset was to be brought into the quarrel—that these gentlemen were leagued with some greater people, whom she need not name to me, to get the Prince to their side, and then, by their behaviour, to throw her off from
<PB N="196" REF="208"/>
her temper, and so make their complaints to the King stronger, and then to make her disoblige his Majesty, in defending the accused; not doubting, if they could once force her into any indiscreet warmth, to make so plausible a story to the King, as might compass their design, which is, to carry the Prince into those other hands at last, by taking him from the people, now about him, and by degrees, conse∣quently, from her. This failing, behold the next step—the Bishop comes to take his leave of me, and with abundance of fawning and flattery, thanks me for all my goodness to him, and all the regard I had been pleased to shew him, &amp;c. when he was in the family; hoping that I would believe, that he left it like an honest man. I replied, continued she, that, for the regard I had shewn him, or any ser∣vices I had done him, he owed me no obli∣gation; it was no more than was his due, and what I should always pay to any body, whom the King was pleased to put about my children in the same station—that as to the motives of his leaving the family,
<PB N="197" REF="209"/>
as I was not acquainted with them, I could say nothing about them. Then, said she, comes my Lord of Harcourt, and he, in a drier way than the Bishop, takes his leave, by thanking me for the favours and support he had received from me, while he was in the family: and in return, I thanked his Lordship for the constant care and attendance he had be∣stowed upon my sons. I replied to her Royal Highness, that I was surprised at the whole before, by what I had heard from the publick talk; but that, now, I was astonished. She said, she thought she had some little reason to take it ill, that such grievous complaints should be made of ma∣nagements about her son, without giving her the least previous intimation of them: that Lord Harcourt complained strongly to the King of dangerous notions, and arbi∣trary principles being instilled into the Prince; and that he could be of no use, unless the instillers of that doctrine. Stone, Cresset, and Scott, were dismissed. That, as he named no particulars, the King had sent the Archbishop and the Chancellor to
<PB N="198" REF="210"/>
command Lord Harcourt to acquaint them with the particulars—that his Lordship's answer was, that the particulars were fit, only, to be communicated to the King, and that he would wait on his Majesty with them. (All this I knew before.) That he did so, and that she had since talked with the King, and his Majesty told her, that Lord Harcourt had only run over the same general topicks again, without enter∣ing into any particulars at all: that the King had assured her of this, and she be∣lieved, he had told her the truth. But, continued she, they have missed their ends, for the King was in very good humour with her and the children, and imputed nothing to them in this whole transaction. I said, that I was extremely pleased her Royal Highness had not been thrown off her temper by this behaviour, considering how offensive it was, how deep it was laid, and who were at the bottom of it: for that I, particularly, and I believed, all good men placed their chief hopes in the Prince's continuing in her hands and under her di∣rection, and in her preserving that influence
<PB N="199" REF="211"/>
over him, which was justly due to her, as well from her prudence, as from nature.— she replied, they would not find it easy to make her lose her temper. I told her of an anonymous letter sent to Dr. Newton, a popular preacher, of St. George's, setting forth the dangerous way the Prince's edu∣cation was left in, and, after touching on the Doctor's popularity, concluding by putting it to him as a duty to take notice of it in the pulpit. She had not heard of it, and seemed at a loss to guess what it meant. I said, the only meaning I could give it was, though perhaps with too much refinement, that they had or would write anonymous letters to the same purpose, to forty or fifty of the London clergy, in hopes that, among so many, one hot-headed fellow might be found, who would take fire at it, and endeavour to distinguish himself by trying to raise a flame about it. But I did not think proper to tell her Royal Highness of another anonymous letter, which was sent to General Hawley, on Wednesday the 20th inst. which, when it was opened, contained nothing to him, but
<PB N="200" REF="212"/>
was a sort of a representation or remon∣strance to the King from the Whig nobi∣lity and gentry; setting forth (as may be seen in my papers No. 9,) their great con∣cern and apprehensions for the Prince's edu∣cation from the hands in which he, now, is; their dissatisfaction at the manner, in which the power of the crown was lodged; that, indeed, some of those who by their offices, were called ministers, and ought to be so, were sometimes tumbled and tossed about, but that there was a permanence of power placed in three men, whom they looked upon as dangerous; and that these men entirely trusted, and were governed by two others; one of whom had the ab∣solute direction of the Prince, and was of a Tory family, and bred in arbitrary prin∣ciples; and the other, who was bred a professed Jacobite of a declared Jacobite family, and whose brother, now at Rome, was a favourite of the Pretender and even his Secretary of State. In short, the co∣rollary was, that Murray, (Solicitor Gene∣ral) and Stone, governed this country. This letter was sent to General Hawley with an
<PB N="201" REF="213"/>
intent no doubt, that he should immedi∣ately carry it to the Duke, that his Royal Highness might lay it before the King and make what first impressions he could. Whether the General did so, I don't know, but I do not suspect him of so much fi∣nesse; but what is certain, is, that he sent it or carried it to the Secretary of State, who laid it before the King. What was the effect, I can't tell; but I know they were very much intrigued to find out whence it came and who was the author.</P>

<P>I had a long conversation with Mr. Vane<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Jan."/> about our negociation with the court, and he seemed to think it much for their inte∣rest to agree with us. He expressed great apprehensions of the Duke and his party.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="214"/>The Princess sent for me—I found her <MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Jan."/>with the Ladies Augusta and Elizabeth— we began with talking of the reconcilia∣tion in the Dorset family: from that, she spoke of the Prussian memorial, of which I gave her my sentiments, which were, that it was, no doubt, meant to be very offensive, not only in matter, but in man∣ner: for that, through the whole, there is no mention made of the King, but the representation is made to the nation and to the ministry, which I thought highly indecent—she replied, she thought it per∣plexed them very much—I said, it must do so, from the difficulty of finding a way to resent the affront. She said, if we did resent it, that Hanover was open, and the King of Prussia could do what he pleased with it, as easily as I could come into the garden where we were, from my terrace. I replied, he had taken an imprudent occa∣sion to insult the King, because the pre∣sent quarrel was upon a point purely English, without the least mixture of Ger∣man, and could not be resented on the Electorate without alarming every Prince
<PB N="203" REF="215"/>
in Germany. That the King of Prussia must know, that the House of Austria watched with impatience to recover Silesia: that he was less a match for Vienna, than Hanover was for him: that I knew, he wanted a war, because he felt his country sinking under the number of troops, which he kept in it, in time of peace. That I did not think France was in a condition, or in the disposition to enter into a war immediately, and, if he was not very sure France would, that he plaid very deep and very dangerously indeed. This part, as well as the rest, of the conversation which was long, being carried on in the cold air, the Princess muffled up, and mostly speak∣ing low that the children might not hear it; I shall choose to throw the principal parts together, as shortly and as clearly as I can, though not exactly in the order they were spoken, but as much in the words as I can recollect—the Dutchess of Devon∣shire's assembly, of last Monday, was men∣tioned; from thence Mr. James Pelham's of last night, which was professedly for hazard, and for the Ministry and Court.
<PB N="204" REF="216"/>
She expressed great dislike at playing pub∣lickly at forbidden games: she spoke, rea∣sonably and warmly, of the ill example and encouragement it gave to all sorts of dis∣sipation, &amp;c. &amp;c. I agreed with her, and mentioned the precautions, which Lord Treasurer Godolphin used, to conceal his passion for play, though he practised it to the last: but added, (to change the discourse) that it was but once a year, at a relation's house; that they had little to do, for all Parliament opposition was over, no body attended, and therefore it was natural that they should amuse themselves a little. She said, yes, all seemed to be quiet now, but how long would it continue so? they never were in so ticklish a situation, as at present: that they were frightened three years ago, but with very little or no rea∣son; that now they had reason; they must know it and feel it, and she was amazed they did not look out for assistance and friends whom they could depend upon, but that their cowardice would be their ruin. I said, I wondered at it too, that their own real friends and dependants were
<PB N="205" REF="217"/>
very much narrowed; but at the same time, she would please to consider, that it was not easy for them to make new con∣nexions; for people of rank and real effi∣ciency, who were unengaged and truly neuters, were but few; and against almost every one of those few, either from false representations or caprice, the King had taken prejudices, which the ministers did not care, or did not dare to combat, which, I supposed, was the occasion of their not strengthening themselves. She said, with great warmth, that, when they talked to her of the King, she lost all patience, for she knew it was nothing: that, in these great points, she reckoned the King no more than one of the trees we walked by, (or something more inconsiderable, which she named) but that it was their pusilla∣nimity which would make an end of them. I said, that it was, indeed, surprising; and if they were willing to accept of as∣sistance, which I was confident, they really wanted, and could not, I was much con∣cerned for them: because, to be sure, in great things the King must comply with
<PB N="206" REF="218"/>
what was reasonable. For instance, Madam, to put a Lady of your Bedchamber, or a Groom of the Stole about your Royal Highness, with whom you must live; or your Private Treasurer, who must enter into all your little domestic, personal de∣tails, I ought to consult your inclinations, nay, even your caprice: but to recommend one of your. Receivers in Cornwall, your interest and the facility of your service ought only to be considered, and you ought not to be indulged in rejecting him, by having taken unfavourable impressions against him, because it would render your service impracticable; and all, so rejected, must believe that I never meant to serve them, or that I had no interest with you, and should not, long, be able to support myself. She said, it was most certainly so, the King was nothing in these things; and every body would drop from them, one by one, on account of their own cowardice. I told her that, surely, she had a right to insist upon their acting otherwise, considering the great support she had given them in the late ticklish,
<PB N="207" REF="219"/>
family transaction. She said, she had done them service; but it signified nothing, if they would not help themselves. I replied, it was great pleasure to me, to find that her Royal Highness favoured those gen∣tlemen, because, for my own part, I really liked and esteemed them, much more than any, who might probably, and who were, now, endeavouring to, succeed them; and because I was desirous to live with, and support them: that I knew nothing of particulars, but that I spoke the lan∣guage of the town, in saying, that she had very greatly and usefully espoused their cause, and, therefore, that she ought to have great weight with them. She said, she was afraid the town said more of it, than she desired; that the truth was, it was certainly her's, and her family's busi∣ness, to keep well with the King, and consequently to countenance those minis∣ters he employed, and she had done so; but she did not understand, that she was bound to them so, as to be in their hands. I replied, that this was the difficulty, and that it was hard to avoid falling into the
<PB N="208" REF="220"/>
hands of either one side, or the other; it was a ticklish situation: and here I stop'd. She said, she had helped them, and was astonished at their cowardice, in not making new friends. What ground did they stand upon? Could they doubt, but that her <HI>good</HI> brother and sister were, the whole day long, doing them all imaginable mischief at St. James's? That, while they were lessening every favourable thing, they were heightening and exaggerating every unfa∣vourable one? The Duke of Bedford stir∣ring Heaven and Earth in the country; opening his house and courting every body in town? What would become of them? Every body would leave them by degrees, on account of their pusillanimity. I said, I was very sorry for their inaction, for that her Royal Highness would please to ob∣serve that, to people, who by their situa∣tion are thrown into politicks; action, in that case, is what life is to the body: we cannot cease to live for a time, and then, take up life again: so in politicks, we must act in some way or another, and we cannot cease action for a time, and then
<PB N="209" REF="221"/>
take it up, again. That I wished the pre∣sent ministry unfeignedly well, and was desirous to employ all my credit and friends in their service; that, besides my friends and their interest, I would un∣dertake to chuse five members for them, without putting them to a shilling ex∣pence, or desiring them to make a tide-waiter: that I thought much, if not their all, depended on a new Parliament, and I was willing to give them my poor assist∣ance, as her Royal Highness had espoused their cause, and as I was, in my opinion and inclination, made more prepossessed in their favour, than for any body, who was in any likelihood to succeed them. Here ended all that was material. I am at a loss to guess, why this great lady presses con∣versations of this nature upon me; I nei∣ther attempt, nor deserve her confidence, nor am I so low, as to be fond of half confidences. I think she must become nothing, by either siding with the minis∣try or the Duke. A third party, of her own, is her only resource in case of a minority, but where she will find that
<PB N="210" REF="222"/>
party, may be difficult; and whether she will find resolution to attempt it or to support it, may still be more difficult. It may, possibly, be her wisest party, and, probably, the party she has or will shortly take, to take hands privately with the Duke of Cumberland, and, instigated by the timidity of the ministers, agree with him and repeal the regency bill, and be thus sole regent in appearance, and he in effect. This I think certain, that, if they do not immediately remove the Duke from the army, and with eclàt, he will over∣power both her and the ministry, who will probably think of struggling when it is too late, but who will not, I think, dare to strike when it might be easy and decisive.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="Feb."/>I went to the House to vote for the li∣berty to import Champaign in bottles. Lord Hillsborough moved it; Mr. Fox seconded it. We lost the question—ayes 74, noes 141.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Feb."/>I waited on the Princess and saw her
<PB N="211" REF="223"/>
alone. I entertained her with town talk, and pleasantries that had passed where I dined. She began, at once, by saying she had good news to tell me; that they were very happy in their family; that the new Bishop gave great satisfaction; that he seemed to take great care, and in a proper manner: and that the children took to him, and seemed mightily pleased. I said, I was very glad that all their Royal High∣nesses were pleased with the Bishop, whom I did not know by sight, but that she would give me leave to hope, that they were all very well pleased with the new Governor also, who was my very good friend, and for whom I had a very great regard. She replied, yes, indeed; that she was but little acquainted with him, but, from all she saw, she had a very good opinion of him; that he was very well bred, very complaisant, and attentive, &amp;c. and the children liked him extemely: but, says she, I look upon a Governor as a sort of pageant, a man of quality for show, &amp;c. I stick to the learning as the chief point: you know how backward they were, when
<PB N="212" REF="224"/>
we were together, and I am sure, you don't think them much improved since. It may be that it is not, yet, too late to acquire a competence, and that is what I am most solicitous about; and if this man, by his manner, should hit upon the means of giving them that, I shall be mightily pleased. The Bishop of Norwich was so confused, that one could never tell what he meant, and the children were not at all pleased with him. I said, that the whole transaction was a very odd thing, that, cer∣tainly, there must be some bottom to it, which we at a distance could not discern. She replied, she thought so; that the stories about the history of the Pere d'Orleans was false: the only little dis∣pute, between the Bishop and Prince Ed∣ward, was about le Pere Perefix's history of Henry the IVth, and that was nothing at all to produce such consequences. That there must be politicks at the bottom: that there was a story of the Bishop's hav∣ing said, that Murray, (the Solicitor Gene∣ral) when he was first appointed, told him that Lord Harcourt was only a cypher;
<PB N="213" REF="225"/>
that, as he (the Bishop) had parts and abi∣lities, he might easily get the whole into his own hands, and at the same time ad∣vised him not to omit so fair an opportu∣nity: that she believed it was a lye, but if it was true, the Bishop must be a bad man to betray the private advice of a friend. I said, I was most confident it was false, that Mr. Murray had too much sense to meddle at all, with what did not belong to him; but if he had done it (which I could never believe) I was sure it could only be in favour of his friend, Stone, with whom he was closely connected: that I looked upon Mr. Murray to be a very emi∣nent man, and much the most able and efficient of all those, who were openly and honourably attached to the ministry. She said, it was very likely; she thought they had very few friends, and wondered at their not getting more, and that it was their cowardice only which hindered them: that, if they talked of the King, she was out of patience; it was as if they should tell her, that her little Harry below would not do what was proper for him; that just so, the
<PB N="214" REF="226"/>
King would sputter and make a bustle, but when they told him that it must be done from the necessity of his service, he must do it, as little Harry must when she came down. I replied, I was sincerely sorry, not for the present, but that I apprehended this want of real, attached, and declared friends might produce ugly consequences and contests, in case of a demise. She said, it was to be apprehended, but she could not help it. I said, that they ought, for her sake, and from what they owed her, to think of those consequences. She an∣swered, they owed her nothing; that in regard to the last disturbances in the fa∣mily, she protested, she knew no more than she had told me—that she never conceived it could come to an open rupture: and again protested that, when she heard that Lord Harcourt had been with the King, on his arrival, to resign, she was as igno∣rant of it, and as much surprised at it, as I could be: that what had been done since, in the replacing them, was done in the puzzled way which I knew, and in which she had very little or no share; and that,
<PB N="215" REF="227"/>
for the ministers, she had never seen them in her life. Madam, says I, your Royal Highness will forgive me, but if I had not catched myself, I was just going to say, Lord, Madam! what do you mean?—I mean, answered she, just as I say; the only way I could see them in the Prince's time, I don't call seeing them; and since that time I have never seen the Duke of New∣castle, what I should call more than once, but as I am speaking to you with great exactness, it was twice; and I have not seen Mr. Pelham at all—no, not once. The Duke was, once, here, with the Arch∣bishop and the Chancellor, upon some for∣mality; and last year, when the King was out of the way, he stole over to Kew, to take his leave, but has never been here, since his return, though almost every body has, as Lady Yarmouth, Munchausen, Lord Anson, &amp;c. Mr. Pelham has behaved bet∣ter, and always very civilly: he had not the same reasons; he might indeed at first, before our money matters were settled, have taken that occasion to come; but as he did not do it, he has had no call; and fears,
<PB N="216" REF="228"/>
I suppose, the King's jealousies and suspi∣cions, who is never without them. When the Duke of Newcastle was with me, I very strongly testified my surprise to him, that he should neglect such a body of the late Prince's servants; that, though they had wished me and my part of the family, better than any other party; yet, as that was over, and they were willing to come under him, surely some of them were worth accepting. If they were not to be rewarded for their attachment, it was sure∣ly strange that they were to have an exclu∣sion put upon them for it. He shuffled and hesitated upon this; but at last said, to be sure it should be thought of, and brought about. I said, it was indeed sur∣prising, for that those gentlemen, instead of having acquired any merit by their ser∣vices, were not even allowed the fair play that they would have had, if they had never entered into the service of the royal family: I thought it very disadvantageous, because, in case of a demise, that all would be to be done, which ought to have been long settled, and ready to be done, in case
<PB N="217" REF="229"/>
of accidents. She said, that the Duke durst not come near her for fear of her sister Amelia. I asked her, if she thought he could be ignorant of her dislike to him, even to inveteracy. She answered, no; but still he was afraid of her. That he had once, since he came, got leave to see her, but on condition that somebody should be in the room: but that, in the case I men∣tioned, she should soon enough have him trotting on all fours to her. That she had nothing to do with them: could they be∣lieve, if the time ever came, that she should forget those whom she had mentioned to them?—that she should forget, what she ought most to remember, from duty, from interest, and from gratitude? She could not help it—it must be <HI>alors, comme alors</HI>. Per∣haps the fewer engagements she was under the better. Thus ended this other very singular conversation.</P>

General, Mr. Hume Campbell, Mr. Ford, and Sir Richard Floyd. I said, though I was in no connection with Mr. Stone that entitled me to call him friend, yet I had long known and observed him: that I had a real esteem for him, and thought him very honest and very able, and I was convinced, that the King had not a more faithful subject, nor one more truly affectionate to every branch of the royal family; that upon this foot, I was not without apprehensions of bringing such an affair into a Court of Justice. Failure, in the least circumstance of proof; tampering with evidence or juries, &amp;c. made me a little uneasy. She replied, she was so too, but they would have it so: that Stone had behaved very well to her, and to the children; that, though it would be treason if it was known, yet he always spoke of the late Prince with great respect, and with great civility of all those whom he knew the Prince had a real value for. That Lord Harcourt behaved very diffe∣rently; that he not only behaved very ill to her, but always spoke to the children

of their father, and of his actions, in so disrespectful a manner, as to send them to her almost ready to cry; and that he did all he could to alienate them from her, in so much, that they themselves were sen∣sible of it, and that George had mentioned it to her once, since Lord Harcourt's de∣parture; that he was afraid he had not be∣haved to her, sometimes, so well as he ought, and wondered how he could be so misled; to which she answered, no, but that, now and then, not with quite so much complaisance, as a young gentleman should use to a lady. I said, I flattered myself she would find a very different behaviour in Lord Waldegrave. She said, yes indeed; that she liked very well all she saw of him. I hinted that this whole thing seemed much deeper laid than at Murray and Stone, and that it struck at the Pelhams. She said, most certainly—they must be blind if they did not see it, and the greatest cowards alive, if they did not resent it: that, now, was the time; and they were undone, if they neglected the opportunity: she repeated, they were undone; that the
<PB N="221" REF="233"/>
King took the thing highly in their favour, and talked of it as the most unworthy at∣tack, and told her that Stone had served him faithfully these twenty years, and that he knew all that he himself knew: that if he was a Peer, every body would think him proper to be Secretary; that his Ma∣jesty had been with her an hour and held this sort of conversation. I said, I was happy the King had taken so favourable an impression; that I hoped and believed it would last; but, however, that it should he made use of, while it was so strong, because it was possible it might cool; con∣sidering, as her Royal Highness herself had been pleased to observe to me, who those per∣sons were, who were always about the King at St. James's, and that the ministry had nobody there. She said, to be sure: they must strike while the iron was hot, or be ruined: that she had told Stone so, who said, they had promised to do what was proper: and that she had replied, Mr. Stone, it is actions, now, and not words that must be expected: that she had seen her great, great fat friend (the Duke) who talked to
<PB N="222" REF="234"/>
her about it, and asked her if she did not think it a very disagreeable affair: that she answered, yes, but that she did not regard it. He asked her, if she was not very sorry it happened: that she replied, not at all, if the ministers would make a proper use of it. She told me then, that Murray had behaved with spirit, and made an ex∣ceeding good speech, of which she gave me a detail as far as she remembered, and particularly took notice that he had marked strongly that it was not he, nor Stone that were principally struck at, but that it went home to the ministry.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="March"/>I went to a cause at council; the Soli∣citor, who was for the appellant, left the reply to the Attorney, during which we had a conversation, wherein he acquainted me with his behaviour; that he was brought in by implication only; that Stone was principally meant and named by Lord Ra∣vensworth, who, from what Fosset had said to him in private conversation, came up and insisted that Stone should be dis∣missed, and that so peremptorily to the
<PB N="223" REF="235"/>
Duke of Newcastle, that he was obliged to lay it before the King, who slighted it: but Stone insisted with him, to have it ex∣amined into, which gave occasion to the bringing it before the council. When he (Murray) heard of this, he sent a message to the King, humbly to acquaint his Ma∣jesty that, if he should be called before such a committee, on so scandalous and in∣jurious an account, he would resign his office and would refuse to answer—that the King highly approved of it—that when it was over, and Stone had been heard, he thought proper to demand an audience, and made a speech, part of which he repeated to me. It was full of spirit, and charged the mat∣ter home, as a deep laid combination against the ministry, &amp;c. I said, every body saw it in the same light, and thought, that if they did not act, they were undone: that the King was now in the most favourable dis∣position; but how long it would last, might be doubted, considering who were nearest to him, and that there was nobody to parry for the ministers. That I had some reasons to think the Princess was much
<PB N="224" REF="236"/>
alarmed at their inactivity: that, unless they could shew they had strength of friends to second her, how could she support them? That I had it from coffee houses, that the design was to end in repealing the regency act, and making the Duke regent; that, (if they did not represent strongly to the King, that, if he liked the absolute tran∣quility of the two houses, he must leave it to them to make use of such instruments, as they thought proper, to continue it) they were ruined. The Solicitor approved of all I said, step by step, in very strong terms. He seemed much alarmed at the repeal of the regency bill, and said, that all I said was true; that they must act, or be undone: they themselves knew it, and he thought they certainly would act, and he particularly approved of what I proposed should be said to the King.</P>

<P><PB N="225" REF="237"/>Mr. Pelham, Mr. Vane, Mr. Furnese and I dined together, by appointment, at<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Mar."/> Mr. Vane's. The offer of our thorough attachment, in return for Mr. Pelham's thorough friendship and protection in bringing us into court, was renewed, and my views of meaning to support their power, and not sharing it as a Minister, was explained. Mr. Pelham, in a very frank and honourable manner, declared his real desire and inclination to accept our friendship, and return his own: that, if his friendship was sufficient to effect the whole, he would with pleasure engage for the whole: but, that he could not answer for the King, whose prejudices were very strong against me, and, chiefly, for my having quitted his services for his son's, &amp;c. but that every thing in his power he would do to remove them, to make way for a measure so truly agreeable to him. I then entered into a detail (which I offered to prove) of the injustice and unreasonable∣ness of these prejudices, and then said, that from this long account, he might naturally expect a request to enter into a justification,
<PB N="226" REF="238"/>
either by myself or by him: but that I did not desire to justify with the King. That all I desired him to say to the King was, that, though it was never in my intention to offend his Majesty, it was sufficient, that he was displeased, for me to think myself to blame, and that, to induce him to for∣give me, I humbly offered him my servi∣ces and all the interest I had in the House, and out of it, for the rest of my life. I added, that I thought this submission and this offer of five members at least, should be sufficient to wipe away impressions, even if I had been a declared Jacobite. He said, it was all that could be said, and all should be made of it, that his credit could make. But that, if it should be practicable, and I should be in any station, and the King should not be prevailed on to behave to me as I might justly expect, I might grow un∣easy and be dissatisfied, as in the case of Pitt, to whom they could never persuade the King to appear commonly civil. I answered, no, not in the least. He said, yes, I might fancy so, and he believed I should. I replied, that I answered with
<PB N="227" REF="239"/>
certainty, because I had considered and made up my mind about that. That all I wished of the King was, to make me over to him (Pelham,) to let him dispose of me, as he thought fit, and suffer him to receive my friendship, attachment and services, that I desired by no means to encroach upon his Majesty's time, or thoughts or behaviour, provided he would give him (Pelham) leave to employ me, for his Ma∣jesty's service, in the way that was most agreeable to him. That I would give him my reasons with the utmost freedom, which were, that, indeed, if I was a new man and in any station, I should, in paying my court, expect that sort of civil return which was my due: but after such unworthy prejudices, and so void of all foundation taken against me, I should never desire any conversation or intercourse with his Ma∣jesty more than a distant, but profound re∣spect on my side, and that, as seldom as was consistent with the duty of a most faithful and respectful subject. Upon the whole, Mr. Pelham behaved in so open and noble a manner, as to chuse to make it
<PB N="228" REF="240"/>
plain, ten times at least, (though he did not make use of the expressions precisely) that I should rather see that he wanted power, than have any doubt of his sincerity, if it did not succeed; and that the doubt of his strength and power alone, hindered him from promising positively to effect it: and therefore, if I judge this right, I am obli∣ged to him, and am determined to be his friend, whether it succeeds or not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Mar."/>Went to the House of Lords, the Duke of Bedford opened the affair of Fosset's re∣port against the Bishop of Gloucester, Stone and Murray, and appealed to Lord Ravens∣worth, who opened the whole transaction in a long narrative. Then the Duke, in a long speech, founded his question upon that narrative, which in substance, was to address the King for the whole proceeding before the council: The Chancellor and Duke of Newcastle answered him, and to make this question (which was foreseen and I think needed not to be so timorously apprehended) the more unnecessary, they had obtained of the King to dispense with
<PB N="229" REF="241"/>
the oath of those Lords of the council upon this occasion, and to suffer them to acquaint the House with the whole pro∣cceding, which those two Lords did pretty much at large. The debate was long and heavy; the Duke of Bedford's performance moderate enough; he divided the house, but it was not told, for there went below the Bar with him, the Earl Harcourt, Lord Townshend, the Bishop of Worcester and Lord Talbot only. The Bishop of Norwich and Lord Harcourt both spoke, not to much purpose; but neither of them, in the least, supported the Duke's ques∣stion. Upon the whole, it was the worst judged, the worst executed, and the worst supported point, that I ever saw of so much expectation.</P>
<P>I will now set down in writing the ex∣act truth of this strange, important trifle.</P>
<P>Mr. Fosset, Messrs. Murray and Stone, were much acquainted, if not school fellows, in early life. Their fortune led them different ways: Fosset's was to be a
<PB N="230" REF="242"/>
country lawyer and recorder of Newcastle. Johnson, now Bishop of Glocester, was one of their associates. On the day the King's birth-day was kept, they dined at the Dean of Durham's, at Durham, this Fos∣set, Lord Ravensworth, Major Davison, and one or two more, who retired after dinner into another room: the conversa∣tion turning upon the late Bishop of Glou∣cester's preferments, it was asked who was to have his Prebend of Durham: the Dean said, that the last news from London was, that Dr. Johnson was to have it: Fosset said, he was glad that Johnson got off so well, for he remembered him a Ja∣cobite several years ago, and that he used to be with a relation of his who was very disaffected, one Vernon, a mercer, where the Pretender's health was frequently drunk. This, passing among a few familiar acquain∣tance was thought no more of at the time: it spread, however, so much in the north (how, I never heard accounted for) and reached Town in such a manner, that Mr. Pelham thought it necessary to desire Mr. Vane, who was a friend to Fosset and who
<PB N="231" REF="243"/>
employed him in his business, to write to Fosset, to know if he had said this of John∣son, and if he had, if it was true.</P>
<P>This letter was written on the 9th of January; it came to Newcastle the Friday following. Fosset was much surprised, but the post going out in a few hours after its arrival, he immediately acknowledged the letter by a long, but not very explicit answer. This Friday happened to be the club-day of the neighbouring gentlemen at Newcastle—as soon as Lord Ravens∣worth, who was a patron and employer of Fosset, came into the town, Fosset ac∣quainted him with the extraordinary letter he had received: he told him, that he had already answered it, and being asked to shew the copy, said he kept none; but desired Lord Ravensworth to recollect, if he held such a conversation at the Deanry of Durham, the day appointed for the birth-day. Ravensworth recollected no∣thing at all of it. They went to the club together, and Ravensworth went the next morning to see his mother in the neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="232" REF="244"/>
with whom he staid till Mon∣day; but this thing, of such consequence, lying upon his thoughts, he returned by Newcastle. He and Fosset had another conversation, and in endeavouring to re∣fresh each other's memory about this dreadful delinquency of Johnson, Fosset said, he could not recollect positively, at such a distance of time, whether Johnson drank those healths, or had been present at the drinking them, but that Murray and Stone had done both, several times. Ravens∣worth was excessively alarmed at this, with relation to Stone, on account of his office a∣bout the Prince; and thus the affair of John∣son was quite forgotten, and the episode be∣came the principal part. There were ma∣ny more conferences between Ravensworth and Fosset, upon this subject, in which the latter always persisted, that Stone and Murray were present at the drinking, and did drink those healths. It may be ob∣served here, that, when he was examined upon oath, he swore to the years 1731 or 1732 at latest. Fosset comes up, as usual, about his law business, and is examined by
<PB N="233" REF="245"/>
Messrs. Pelham and Vane, who never had heard of Murray or Stone being named: he is asked and answers, only with relation to Johnson, never mentioning either of the others: but the love of his country, his King, and posterity, burned so strongly in Ravensworth's bosom, that he could have no rest, till he had discovered this enormity. Accordingly, when he came to town, he acquainted the ministry and almost all his great friends with it, and insisted upon the removal of Stone. The ministry would have slighted it, as it de∣served, but, as he persisted and had told so many of it, they could not help laying it before the King, who, though he himself slighted it, was advise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to examine it, which examination produced this most injudicious proceeding in Parliament. The Duke of De∣vonshire was the only one of the commit∣tee, who was absent from the House. The ministers, and indeed, every body el<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, did imagine, and, I believe, still do, that this whole affair is combined with the resigna∣tions, and that there was a set of pretended friends to the Pelhams ready to take ad∣vantage
<PB N="234" REF="246"/>
of it; and, I know, that Mr. Pel∣ham did think that this motion would give great lights to it. How far their expecta∣tions are answered, I cannot say; mine were entirely disappointed, for the whole was so ill conducted and supported, that I should almost be tempted to believe, that the grounds, which carried our conjectures into a sort of certainty, had no foundation at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Mar."/>I waited on the Princess, who seemed much pleased that the affair had ended so well in the House of Lords, and said, that it was owing to the King's steadiness and resolution, that it went no farther: that his Majesty took it with good sense and proper firmness, without which the Lords of the Cabinet would not have behaved as they did. It is remarkable, that this is the first time, that I ever heard her speak favourably of the King. In mentioning my reasons for having an opinion of Mr. Stone, without having any friendship with him, I said, that from thence I was glad when I heard he was placed about the
<PB N="235" REF="247"/>
Prince. She replied, she was not; on the contrary, she was very sorry, and much alarmed at it. I was surprised, and asked why? She answered, because the Prince had always taught her to believe, that Stone was a Jacobite, and that she did firmly be∣lieve it: that the Prince was convinced of it, and, when affairs went ill abroad, used to say to her in a passion, how could better be expected, when such a Jacobite as Stone was trusted?</P>

<PB N="236" REF="248"/>
besides Mr. Beckford? and asked, if the Duke of Cumberland was to protect them? he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> answered, with the Duke of Bedford, but Mr▪ Beckford could not tell whether his Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Highness was concerned. Ralph then asked, if he, with his instruments, was to be se∣cured and protected against all law prosecu∣tions? what establishment for himself? and if he was to lay down his own plan and write in conformity to it, or if it was expected, that he should be confined? answered, that he should be thoroughly protected, and by those, who would own him in both Houses —that his allowance should be handsome, but could not then name the sum, and that he was to be at entire liberty. Upon which being pressed to go to the Duke of Bedford, who desired to see him soon, he promised Mr. Beckford to take an early opportunity of waiting upon his Grace.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="May"/>Mr. Vane, now Lord Barnard, called upon me: I talked very strongly to him, and told him of the open manner of inlisting all sorts of people against the Pelhams. I men∣tioned Ralph's resolution, and put him in
<PB N="237" REF="249"/>
mind, that I had offered his (Ralph's) ser∣vices as my friend, and bade him recollect in how improper a manner Mr. Pelham had rejected him: I told him, that I had reason to expect that Pelham should have given up his resentments against him, on my account; but that, certainly, prudence should have made him do it, for his own sake. Lord Barnard thought writing of great consequence, though, he said, Mr. Pelham did not. I replied, that Mr. Pel∣ham mistook himself; that no man was more susceptible of its effects, and no man more easily hurt by it: was there a stronger proof of it, than the pre∣sent case? What was this irreconcileable∣ness against Ralph occasioned by, but the impression of a pamphlet, which, after all, the man did not write? That I was sure, Mr. Pelham would repent it very soon, and that I no way farther interfered in it; yet I desired he should know this, and more particularly, that, (as I had given him the offer of a most useful, honest, and able man, and upon his rejecting it, had, some time since, given him fair warning
<PB N="238" REF="250"/>
by him, Lord Barnard, of what would happen) I must have no complaints, or in∣sinuations, or even thoughts, that I was any way, act or part, in any thing that might come out: it was language I would not hear, and insinuations I would not suf∣fer. I was sorry for the step, because I knew how naturally people were misled when they were hurt. Who could tell, what a man, that had been Secretary of State, might furnish? and how galling it might be rendered by the ablest pen in England? That I was grieved to see so little spirit opposed to so much vehemence and viru∣lence, as their declared enemies acted with; that their efficient enemies, it was true, were but few in number, but yet, they were the King's son, and daughter, and a Duke of Bedford: that I thought the Pelhams had not three such efficient friends, in or out of St. James's: that my fears suggested, and reason confirmed me, that, if they did not exert themselves, and give proofs of their power to the world, by their protection to their friends, num∣bers would gradually drop from them:
<PB N="239" REF="251"/>
that their all depended upon the new Par∣liament: that I hoped they were active about it: that I had some little influence, as well as positive interest, in that election; but that I knew no more, what they were about, and how to apply that influence, than if I had never known their names: he was, however, to understand me, that these were the fears, not the complaints of a friend: that I meant no complaint, for that I had nothing to complain of: that I meant and asked the Pelhams' friendship and good-will, and in return offered them my services and attachment: that Mr. Pelham was pleased to accept this offer, and to promise his friendship and counte∣nance in return: that I never asked him for any emolument, at any time, or in any manner: that his Lordship knew, I had been requested to do so, but that I never would, having resolved to leave it wholly to Mr. Pelham, how he thought proper to make use of my personal services; those, that were in my power, in my present situ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, I had promised, and he should have them. Nothing but words had, as yet,
<PB N="240" REF="252"/>
passed between us, but he should see that I would act. In my present state, all I could give him, was my country interest, and influence in the elections, and he should have them. I would certainly chuse any two he pleased, at Weymouth, and though I new nothing of his measures, all my in∣fluence should go in the way, that I could guess he most wished: that I did, and should leave the rest entirely to him, with regard to his fulfilling his part. If he thought I could be of no further use, I could not help it; but if he thought I might, he would produce me in the way, in which he could best enable me to per∣form it: that this was wholly Mr. Pel∣ham's affair—it did not depend upon me; for what depended upon me, I should cer∣tainly perform: that, therefore, though I desired he should know all this clearly and explicitly, yet I expected he should un∣derstand it, as it really was, the naked sentiments, only, and apprehensions of a friend, without any mixture of complaint, or having the least intention to complain. I have forgotten to insert, in its place,
<PB N="241" REF="253"/>
an instance of their timidity towards their friends, which I mentioned to Lord Bar∣nard, and which is too striking to be omit∣ted. I asked his Lordship, how he thought our friend Murray felt, to find that his friends in power suffered a most offensive and hurtful calumny, meant at them also, to be fixed on him and made matter of ex∣amination, instead of being rejected with indignation, by a Court the most unpre∣cedented, through the whole proceeding, that ever met! I suppose, said I, you will tell me, that there were reasons that made it unavoidable: I know them, the Caven∣dishes would not stand it, but leaned the other way. Stop here a moment—is not that saying, let it hurt whom it will, let it be never so inconvenient and lessening to you, we will not forfeit, nay, not ven∣ture one atom of our credit with the herd. Murray condescends to defend himself; he treats calumny and clamour with the noble spirit they deserve, and artfully winds in an apology to them: they are then satisfied. That is, after his having been the subject of an illegal enquiry into an impertinent,
<PB N="242" REF="254"/>
disgraceful imputation, and not having the least speck appear upon him, the ministry are satisfied. To be sure, Murray must think himself greatly obliged to them. After all this, and when the same scandal was brought into the most publick assembly, with the impotence of proof, in order to spread it through the nation: what do his friends in power do? they say, he was ef∣fectually justified, without doing one act to shew their resentment of the persecution he had suffered, either by disgracing the abettors, or punishing the authors of it. How must a most able, active, openly at∣tached friend feel such tameness! he re∣plied, he thought (and I believe he did think) as I did. Mr. Pelham spoke to me at council, and told me that he had seen Lord Barnard, and that he thought him∣self extremely obliged to me for what had passed between us, he said, he was highly sensible how much he owed me, and that he would soon find an opportunity to talk with me at large.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="May"/>Mr. Ralph was yesterday with the Duke

<P>I passed the day with the Princess of<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="July"/> Wales by her order. I was very friendly and kindly received: our conversation was chiefly of a domestick familiar nature. Nothing very remarkable in politicks, ex∣cept my observing that people, who chiefly out of regard to her, had declined all op∣position, and were very ready and desirous to contribute to the service of the present ministry, notwithstanding this, were still to remain in a state of proscription: that such people were pretty much snaffled by the apprehension that, if they resented it, they might be considered as being in op∣position
<PB N="244" REF="256"/>
to her and to the young Prince, to whom their attachment and affection was inviolable and invariable. Whereas it was hard to believe that the treatment which their Royal Highnesses met with, was so cordial and endearing, as to oblige them to espouse the quarrels of the present Court, especially against those who were driven into those quarrels by the treatment they met with from their attachment to their Royal Highnesses and to the late Prince. She said, to be sure it was so, but she was not so explicit upon the head, as I wished. She gave into it, but rather seemed to allow it, than declare it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="July"/>I went to Eastbury, and on the Saturday following I dined at Lord Shaftesbury's, who was determined not to go to the meeting at Dorchester, for the nomination of the Knights of the Shire. But finding that I was to go, he was perplexed, and more so, by a letter he received at dinner from Lord Digby, requesting him to at∣tend. We left his Lordship uneasy and irresolute.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="257"/>I was at Dorchester to assist at the meet∣ing. Lord Digby was brought, in the<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="August"/> winter, to me by Lord Hillsborough, from Messrs. Pelham and Fox. He asked for my interest, as determining to stand on the Whig interest. I told him that, if no re∣lation, or person, with whom I had parti∣cular connections, should set up on the same interest, mine was at his service: from that time to the present moment, I never saw Lord Digby, nor was I consulted with by any of his friends.</P>
<P>Soon after my coming to the Antelope, at Dorchester, he came to me and requested my favour; I told him, that was my only business there. He soon returned with Lord Ilchester, and they both pressed me to stand with him, which I declined. Lord Milton, Messrs. Drax, Trenchard, and most of the Whig party came to me. I found that Mr. Trenchard was to propose Lord Dig∣by, but that neither he nor his uncle Ilches∣ter had consulted, or concerted any thing with any body. I said, there could be no doubt of the Whigs carrying the election,
<PB N="246" REF="258"/>
if they resolved upon it, because, to my knowledge, two-thirds of the property of the county were in their hands, and because I had carried it for Mr. Pitt's fa∣ther (who was scarcely capable) when our property was considerably less. But, whe∣ther they would resolve to go through it at all events, I did not in the least know: that I supposed Lord Digby's adviser had asked and knew: but, if not, a party meet∣ing should be held and consulted. Every body appeared to approve of this: the Lords Ilchester and Digby, both told me, privately, that Mr. Pelham encouraged Lord Digby to stand, and that, a little be∣fore the Parliament rose, Mr. Pelham took Lord Digby aside in the House, and said, that he was informed it would certainly do, and pressed him to go on with it. I replied to him, that I did not know from whom Mr. Pelham had his information, but that it did not come from me: that I would do him all the services I could, and all the return I desired, was, that he would remember I was, no ways, consulted nor advising in the affair. We went up
<PB N="247" REF="259"/>
to the meeting about noon. I believe, of Whigs we might be somewhat more than thirty gentlemen; when the Tories came, we were about one hundred.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Long proposed Mr. Pitt. Mr. Bingham returned Mr. Chafin's thanks to the county, and his excuses for declin∣ing; and then Sir Robert proposed Mr. Sturt to join with Mr. Pitt. Mr. Tren∣chard proposed Lord Digby—nobody said a word. Then Mr. Francis Seymour spoke a few words in support of Pitt and Sturt, in order to keep the county out of <HI>ministe∣rial dependence</HI>—to this nothing was of∣fered on our side, till people began to move; when I thought it necessary to take some notice of the expressions, which I did, and concluded by saying, that I should give my interest to Lord Digby alone, till I saw farther. Thus it ended, with very little spirit of their side, and with none at all, of ours.</P>
<P>I was at Bridgewater, and, with Mr.<MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="August"/> Balch, canvassed near half the town. The

<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="August"/>We returned home to Eastbury. The excessive badness of the roads and weather, with the nature of the business, made it much the most disagreeable journey, and the most fatiguing week I ever passed. All this trouble, vexation, and expence, as well as that to come, flows from a set of low, worthless fellows, who finding they shall not be bribed without an opposition, have prevailed on Lord Egmont to lend his name, to whom they will give one vote, that they may be able to sell the other. And, notwithstanding, as things now ap∣pear, his Lordship has no chance of making his election. This he does not see, nor that the Tories (though partly for other reasons) make his greatest strength; so that he is setting up an interest, which, if it should succeed, he could never sit in quiet in that place. But though, I think, he has no chance at present, yet the unea∣siness

and expence will be the same to me, as if he was sure of success.</P>

<P>I went early to Mr. Pelham, and talked<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Oct."/> with him about Bridgewater: he gave me the strongest assurance of his assistance, and promised to write immediately him∣self to Philip Baker, to convince every body of his friendship for me; and that the Custom-house officers should be pro∣perly taken care of. I am persuaded he is sincere.</P>
<P>I was with Mr. Pelham again, who has<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Oct."/> done all that can be expected hitherto, and promises to continue all his endeavours to support my election at Bridgewater against Lord Egmont's opposition. In this affair
<PB N="250" REF="262"/>
he has acted, and, I am convinced, he will act the part of a real friend. But I do not find that he has made any progress in the great point of smoothing my way to the King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Oct."/>The Princess of Wales and Lady Augusta, attended by Lady Middlesex and Mr. Bre∣ton, did Mrs. Dodington and me the ho∣nour of breakfasting with us. After break∣fast, we walked all round my gardens: we then came in, and they went into all the rooms, except the common dining-parlor: when we were coming down stairs, I told their Royal Highnesses, that there was one room, which I had forgotten to shew them; they desired to see it, and found a cold collation (for it was near three o'clock.) The Princess very obligingly sat down, and we all ate a very hearty and very chear∣ful meal: she staid with us till the day began to decline, and behaved with infi∣nite ease and condescension.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Oct."/>The Duke of Cumberland is dangerously
<PB N="251" REF="263"/>
ill of a quinsey, but the truth of his illness proceeded from a fall from his horse.</P>
<P>Mr. Ralph told me, that he had made<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Nov."/> his peace with the ministry, by the means of Lord Hartington, to whose favour he was recommended by Mr. Garrick: that he was to have 300<HI>l.</HI> a year and 200<HI>l.</HI> im∣mediately down, to repay to those he was engaged with, the money they had advanced to him. Mr. Pelham had told me all this before, as also, that it was contrary to his opinion, but that his brother was un∣easy about it, and therefore he had ac∣quiesced.</P>
<P>I saw Mr. Pelham: he told me that<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Nov."/> Lord Poulet went immediately out of town from waiting, and that he had had no conversation with him, but a broken one, while he was waiting to be called in by the King. His Lordship had told him he had seen his letter, and denied, that he had ever said Mr. Pelham was for Lord Eg∣mont, but that he (Lord Poulet) was for him, and would fairly own it. Mr. Pel∣ham
<PB N="252" REF="264"/>
replied, that if was not material; but that he (Lord Poulet) should publickly declare at the Mayor's feast, that he (Pel∣ham) was indifferent between the three, when his Lordship knew he had so expli∣citly declared himself in favour of me and my friend, was very singular; as was also, his being for Lord Egmont, when he (Poulet) had offered and promised both his brother and him, to do as they should desire him, which, they told him, was en∣tirely to assist me in every thing. He was called in, to the King, before Lord Poulet could make an answer. The King asked him about this election, and Lord Poulet's behaviour, and said, that he knew, he had made up with his son before he died, but the King could not tell whether the recon∣ciliation was owing to me or Lord Egmont, but that one or the other had a hold upon him. Mr. Pelham said to the King, that he knew nothing of his own knowledge, but he conjectured it might be by both, and that, he believed, Lord Poulet's plan was, as far as he could contrive, that the election should fall upon Lord Egmont
<PB N="253" REF="265"/>
and me. The King said he thought so too, but that was not enough, and then asked him, how he thought it would go? Mr. Pelham answered, that he did not find by me, that I was disposed to give up the in∣terest; but when it came to much expence and much trouble, which must be the consequence, he supposed, as his Majesty did, that their design was to let me see my own election, and in that case I could not say how it would go: for that he did not think he had a right, in the present situation I stood, to insist upon my en∣gaging to go through that expence and trouble, to keep out an opposer, when my own election would be easy without it. I told Mr. Pelham that I would be at a word with him: that the fact and the in∣terest was exactly, as the King and he un∣derstood it: that as to the interest, my seat did not depend upon it—that I had nobody to succeed me, whom I could wish should be the better for it—to this he agreed. I added, that when I did things, I never did them by halves: I professed at∣tachment to him, and that where I had
<PB N="254" REF="266"/>
any interest, I meant to exert it agains<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those who opposed his administration: that, therefore, I desired him humbly to assure his Majesty in my name, that my election was not the object, for that I would undergo the same trouble and the same expence, to keep out any body that differed with his ministers, as I would, if my own seat was in question. Mr. Pelham promised me, he would make the kindest use of my declarations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Nov."/>I waited upon the Princess, who re∣ceived me with great goodness: she com∣plained of the little regard paid to her re∣commendation of the late Prince's servants: she supposed, she said, the ministers meant a great regard to her; meant it, but had not shewn it, yet.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Nov."/>The Parliament opened. I went to hear the speech, which was very unexception∣able. In the House of Lords, the Duke of Newcastle brought in a bill to repeal the act of last session in favour of the Jews. Doctors Secker and Drummond, of Oxford
<PB N="255" REF="267"/>
and St. Asaph, spoke for the repeal, with sentiments of charity, comprehension, and liberty of conscience, highly becoming them, and to the honour both of the Church and State.</P>
<P>The Princess sent for me to attend her<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Nov."/> between eight and nine o'clock. I went to Leicester House, expecting a small com∣pany and a little musick, but found no∣body but her Royal Highness. She made me draw a stool and sit by the fire-side. Soon after came in the Prince of Wales and Prince Edward, and then the Lady Augusta, all in an undress, and took their stools and sat round the fire with us. We continued talking of familiar occurrences till between ten and eleven, with the ease and unreservedness and unconstraint, as if one had dropped into a sister's house that had a family, to pass the evening. It is much to be wished that the Princes con∣versed familiarly with more people of a certain knowledge of the world. The Princess's attention to me seems an indica∣tion of a good heart, as if she resolved, as
<PB N="256" REF="268"/>
far as it is in her power, that the Prince should not forget those, who were beloved by, and deserved well of, his father.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Dec."/>I saw the Duke of Newcastle and con∣vinced him, that my trouble and expence at Bridgewater, was only to keep out a man, who opposed those to whom I at∣tached myself: that my own seat was not concerned in it: that the maintaining the interest there was, to me, nothing, having nobody to bequeath it to. I then told him that, in these matters, those who would take money, I would pay, and not bring him a bill: those, that would not take, he must pay, and I recommended my two par∣sons of Bridgewater and Weymouth, Bur∣roughs and Franklin: he entered into it very cordially, and assured me that they should have the first Crown livings that should be vacant in their parts, if we would look out and send him the first in∣telligence. I then just touched upon what had passed between Mr. Pelham and me. He professed his knowledge and approbation of the whole. I said, I must think that so
<PB N="257" REF="269"/>
much offered and so little asked, in such hands as theirs, and at a time when bo∣roughs were a commodity particularly marketable, could not fail of removing, at least, resentments, and of obtaining pardon, which language I was willing to hold to my own Sovereign, but to no other. His Grace was very hearty, and cordial, and protested that every thing should be done to shew their true regard and friendship for me. He did seem to lay no great stress upon difficulties with the King. I con∣cluded by telling him, that I had no de∣sires of being in favour with the King, or even well with him, or about him: that all I desired was that he, and his brother might be able to say, that the King left me to them—that was all my price. He answered very cordially—to appearance.</P>
<P>I waited on the Princess, and staid with<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Dec."/> her two hours. Much freedom and con∣descension—rather too much of the first on my side. I endeavoured (by her order) to explain to her the present unhappy divi∣sions in Ireland, and beg'd her to make the
<PB N="258" REF="270"/>
Prince thoroughly master of them. I told her, that though I did not doubt but tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the present heats would, somehow, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appearance be allayed, yet, I was sincerely grieved at the consequences which might, from indisposing numbers of a rich and thriving people, most cordially attached to the family hitherto, arise in a new and young reign: that I did not like the pros∣pect. She replied, with a visible alteration in her countenance to a mixture of fierce∣ness and grief that I had never seen before, —it is true, and we have other very disa∣greeable prospects. Then, very suddenly, she recovered her placidness of look and voice. I said, indeed. Madam, I do not see any. What at that moment struck her, I know not, but it was very forcibly: per∣haps it might be the Duke. She told me some instances of the Prince's feeling the subjection he was under. (I have since heard, that Prince Edward complains of it, and of his brother's want of spirit.) I said, it was to be wished he could have more company. She seemed averse to the young people, from the excessive bad education
<PB N="259" REF="271"/>
they had, and from the bad examples they gave. She appears uneasy, and indeed, her situation is very disagreeable, and much to be pitied.</P>
<P>The Earl of Home, on Sunday night,<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Dec."/> brought the account from Ireland, that the Irish Parliament had rejected the bill for the appropriation of the surplusses (which was altered in council, here, by the addi∣tion of the King's consent only) by five voices. A dangerous event, and produc∣tive of more mischiefs than I shall live to see remedied!</P>
<P>I went to White's, to a ballot for in∣creasing<MILESTONE N="1754."/> the old club, which passed in the<MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Jan."/> negative, 34 to 10. At an election, the Earl of Huntingdon had one black ball, and the Earl of Hillsborough had three.</P>
<P>I had much talk with Lord Barnard, who<MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Jan."/> gave me strong assurances of the friendship and regard of the ministers for me: that they would do every thing possible for me with the King: that nobody died to make
<PB N="260" REF="272"/>
room, and they could not turn out. Many instances of their p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimity, without his perceiving it himself. He declared his and their detestation of Mr. Fox—George Grenville's insolence in refusing to come to town, and of opposing the number of sea∣men without the least notice to Mr. Pel∣ham—Pitt's perfidy, and his party's mak∣ing up to the Prince—that Barrington would not accept of being chosen at Saltash, but would be elected at Plymouth, which borough was designed for Admiral Clinton, Lord Lincoln's uncle—that Fox had asked Mr. Pelham for the first vacancy in the Treasury for Barrington, but had been ab∣solutely refused—that Dupplin was to have it, and Lord Northumberland was to have the first blue ribband.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Jan."/>Went to the Duke of Newcastle, and got the living of Broadworthy for Mr. Burroughs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Feb."/>My old and intimate acquaintance, poor Mr. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpden, died suddenly.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="273"/>I waited upon the Princess, who was sitting to Leotardi for her picture. Lady<MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Feb."/> Augusta only was with her.</P>
<P>Council at St. James's. The Judges at∣tended<MILESTONE N="28." UNIT="Feb."/> and were called in. A charge was delivered to them (the King present, and in his name) by the Chancellor, to be by them given on their respective circuits, against irreligion, immorality, murders, poisonings, &amp;c. This was in consequence of a motion in the House of Lords, by the Bishop of Worcester, for something to be done by the Legislature to this effect, in consequence of the last paragragh of the King's speech, at the opening of the ses∣sions.</P>
<P>As soon as I rose, I received an account<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="March"/> that Mr. Pelham died at six o'clock.</P>
<P>I went to Lord Barnard and staid with<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="March"/> him till five in the morning. We had a long conversation and agreed that, if Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came into Mr. Pelham's place, their interest was entirely undone: that Mr. Fox
<PB N="262" REF="274"/>
had declared, he would have it; that he had served up to it, and it was his due, and that he was resolved to give way to nobody: that the Pitts, Lyttletons, and Grenvilles had written a letter, that, if Mr. Fox had it, they would oppose: that Lord Bath had sent a message to the Chan∣cellor, that if Fox came in, old as he was, he would muster up a party to oppose: that he was sure Mr. Furnese, I, and my friends would also do so: that Fox was at Lord Hartington's, between seven and eight on Wednesday morning: that Har∣tington was for him: that he thought the Duke of Grafton was so too, who had be∣haved most infamously to Mr. Pelham, and was a most perfidious man: that Mr. Pel∣ham led a most uneasy life, from his bro∣ther, as well as from some family affairs: that when Lord Barnard died, the Duke of Newcastle sent him a letter, directed to the Earl of Darlington, and told him he must take it as the only mark, then i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their power, of their particular regard to him: that, some time after, the Duke pro∣posed him, and the Lord Chancellor, to
<PB N="263" REF="275"/>
the King for that honour, who refused both, and told him, he supposed he de∣signed to leave nobody on the Baron's Bench; and now that <HI>he had cheated</HI> Lord Barnard out of the settlement of succession to his estate, he wanted to make him amends by promoting him to be an Earl.</P>
<P>The Duke went to Cambridge for ten days, but made his brother, Mr. Pelham, give his word, that he would not stir in this thing, during his absence. Somebody acquaints Lady Yarmouth with it, who puts the King in better temper about it. She bids Mr. Pelham move it to the King: he excuses himself upon his word given to his brother: she says, they must agree that, among themselves; for the King is prepared and expects to hear of it. Mr. Pelham moves it, and it is favourably re∣ceived. The Duke returns, and the mo∣ment he sees his brother, flies into the most violent passion, that he had told him a lye, broke his word, &amp;c. &amp;c. with such intemperance, that Mr. Pelham went away to the Solicitor General, till he cooled.
<PB N="264" REF="276"/>
Friends interposed, but the Duke, another day, flew into the same intemperance to Lord Barnard and Mr. Arundell, in pre∣sence of his valet de chambre, that he would <HI>fourt</HI> his brother, that he would make him know that he should not dare to do any thing in his absence, &amp;c.—and they did not see one another for a fortnight. This story shews the uneasiness of Mr. Pelham's situation in his private life. Lord Barnard pressed me much, to suggest whom I thought proper to fill Mr. Pelham's place, I said, the Solicitor—that would not do— he would not take it—the people would not bear it. I said, then put a Lord at the head, and make a Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer.—What Lord?—Why not Lord Carlisle?—the best he had heard named. Any but Lord Winchelsea; his behaviour had been such to Mr. Pelham, that he would never sit at a Board with him—that if ever the Duke of Newcastle suffered him in any employment, while he had any power, he should look on him as a very mean creature—that the Duke of Devon∣shire was sent for, who went to Chatsworth
<PB N="265" REF="277"/>
last Monday, but he doubted if he would come—that Mr. Pelham was my friend sincerely, had often mentioned me favour∣ably to the King, and when I had executed what I had engaged in, about the elections, he hoped to be able to serve me, but would not tell me so, till he was sure he could do it—[this I took for <HI>Moonshine</HI>.] As an in∣stance of Mr. Fox's perfidy to Mr. Pelham, he said, that he set the King upon him to repeal the place-bill, which Mr. Pelham absolutely refused; and now, lately, upon the endeavour to repeal the oath, in the bribery act; the day it was to be moved, he was with Mr. Pelham at two o'clock, and gave him his word, that he would <HI>not</HI> speak for the repeal, and then went to the House and <HI>did</HI> speak for it. Lord Barnard concludes, that he (Fox) went from Mr. Pelham to the Duke, who commanded him to speak; and the rather, because being at the House himself, he saw Lord Sandwich in the gallery, and observed, that, as soon as Fox had spoken, that Lord went away. He said, that Sandwich was a most dishonest man; that the Duke of Newcastle was, at
<PB N="266" REF="278"/>
first, in raptures of fondness for him; and when he grew angry with him, Mr. Arun∣dell told Mr. Pelham, 'twas his own fault, he had nothing to complain of; when he knew, that he betrayed Chesterfield to him, what reason had he to think or to be sur∣prised, that he should not betray him to the Duke.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="March"/>Waited on the Princess. We began by laughing about the plays. I then told her that, as I did not design to trouble her long, my message should be short; and it was only to put her in mind and desire her to remember, that, at this time of changes and at all others that might happen, my first engagements were to her and her House, to which, when she would let me know her pleasure, all others were to give place, and should be subservient. She re∣ceived it most kindly, and said, she was thoroughly convinced of it: and that no changes that could happen, ought or should make her and her's forget my friendship and attachment to them. And now. Ma∣dam, says I, if your Royal Highness pleases,
<PB N="267" REF="279"/>
we will return to the play. But she could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the subject—asked what I thought t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y would do? I said, I had not seen any body, who could be supposed to have any direction—that I did not, in the least, de∣sire to be informed by her Royal Highness, but that, to be sure, she must have some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts about it. She answered, she had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. I said, that was a fault, and that she ought to have them; that the ministry, of late years, had been like children round a fire, telling stories of spirits, till they frightened one another, that they dared not look behind them—that it was become necessary, that she should give them cou∣rage—that the people were very solicitous to see something that looked, as if she had a share in it, and that her security was considered—that I would not mention what was said, because particular names were mentioned unfavourably. She replied, what could she do? To get things into the hands of certain people, was as impossible as to move St. James's House; and for any thing else what did it signify? Besides, she sup∣posed they knew where Leicester House
<PB N="268" REF="280"/>
stood, it was open. I said, that means should be found to direct them; for, what had happened to Mr. Pelham would, sooner or later, and in less time, happen elsewhere. She said, <HI>alors, comme alors</HI>. I replied, that she would be pleased to consider, that she would have these, and only these hands to work with, if she continued as she was; and it might create some difficulty to begin with those where there was so little corres∣pondence or connection. She said, it was not an agreeable prospect; she hoped the King would do what was best; but she thought Mr. Fox would succeed Mr. Pelham, and she was very sorry for it; and this great dislike of Mr. Fox's coming in, she repeated seve∣ral times in the rest of our conversation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="March"/>I had good intelligence that the Princess took what I said to her very kindly, and that she expressed herself favourably of me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="March"/>Dined at Mr. Stanley's—and here I must take notice of the extraordinary scenes that have passed, since the death of Mr. Pelham.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="281"/>He died about six o'clock on Wednesday the 6th. Mr. Fox was at the Mar∣quis of Hartington's before eight that morning. Negociations begun. The Duke of Devonshire was sent for, the same day: he came on Saturday night the 9th. I was informed that, as Mr. Fox was supported by the Duke and the Princess Emily, to succeed Mr. Pelham, the plan to disappoint him was, to refuse the Treasury, but to offer him something that was better than the War Office; which they hoped and believed he would refuse, and then to in∣cense the King against him, and shew him, that Fox would take nothing, that was compatible with the Duke of Newcastle's remaining in power. This I was told, but could not figure to myself, what that some∣thing was to be. On Monday the 11th, at night, by the intervention of Lord Har∣tington, between the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Fox, the King agreed that the Duke of Newcastle should be at the head of the Treasury, Mr. Legge Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Fox, Secretary of of State. I knew it early the next morn∣ing,
<PB N="270" REF="282"/>
and finding <HI>that</HI> was the <HI>something</HI>, I thought it a something that must ruin the Duke of Newcastle. On Tuesday night, this was declared to the Cabinet Council. Wednesday night, the 13th, Mr. Fox had a meeting with the Duke of Newcastle, where, as it afterwards appeared, they dif∣fered about the powers that he (Fox) was to be trusted with, in his office: for he understood, by Lord Hartington, that he was to have the direction of the House of Commons, and had acquainted me that morning, by Mr. Ellis, a Lord of the Ad∣miralty, that he was to have the absolute direction of that House, but under the Duke of Newcastle, and as his <HI>man</HI>, who was to remain in full power, with the whole confi∣dence and secret of the King. But finding, at this conference with the Duke of New∣castle, that either this was not meant; or, that he was not to be trusted with sufficient powers to execute it properly, they parted dissatisfied; and the following morning, Thursday the 14th, Fox wrote to the Duke to be excused from accepting the seals of Secretary. This news I heard at dinner,
<PB N="271" REF="283"/>
and was much surprised at it, as was the the whole town. One side says, he used, and wrote the most abject submissions, to get the seals: he says, that he only offered, as he really meant, to serve absolutely un∣der the Duke of Newcastle, and only re∣quired sufficient powers to be able to do it in the House, without exposing himself.</P>
<P>Mr. Ellis came to me, with the avowal<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Mar."/> of Mr. Fox, to give me the material part of this account, adding that, as a proof of what Mr. Fox meant, he instanced Mr. Craggs being Lord Sunderland's man, when he had the Treasury, and was in full power with the late King—and also, that he had declared to the Duke of Newcastle, that he never desired to touch a penny of the secret-service money, or to know the dis∣position of it, farther than was necessary to enable him to speak to the members, with∣out appearing ridiculous. He ended with strong assurances of Mr. Fox's regard and friendship to me, and his desires of having mine in return:—this very strong.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="284"/>Went to see the Duke of Newcastle▪ <MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Mar."/>Much company, and no opportunity to tall with him. This day came out a new com∣mission of Treasury, such as I never saw▪ The Duke of Newcastle in his brother'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place, and the four former Commissioner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> —none of them Chancellor of the Exche∣quer—that remaining with Lord Chief Jus∣tice Lee.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Mar."/>Dined with me, the Earls of Coventry, Jersey, Temple, and Hillsborough; Lords Strange, Hobart, and Barrington; Sir Fran∣cis Dashwood, and Mr. George Grenville. The talk was that Sir Thomas Robinson was to be Secretary of State, and that he had refused it—this was not believed. Lord Barrington staid after the company were gone, and told me his transactions with Mr. Pelham, relating to the Treasury, and last Thursday, with the Duke of Newcas∣tle. He states his promises from Mr. Pel∣ham too strong, if what Lord Barnard told me, be true—and by his conversation with the Duke of Newcastle, I think he will not
<PB N="273" REF="285"/>
have it this time; at least, not before Lord Dupplin.</P>
<P>I was to wait upon the Duke of Newcastle,<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Mar."/> who, with great <HI>seeming</HI> kindness, beg'd me to come to him on Thursday, by nine in the morning: that he was sensible of my friend∣ship, and would endeavour to deserve it; I said, he certainly did deserve it; but, I hoped, he would shew the world that I had his. He replied, that he would use all his endeavours.</P>
<P>Went to the Duke of Newcastle's. Be∣gan<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Mar."/> by telling him, that I considered and respected the weight, he must lie under, of different kinds, at this time; therefore, should never trouble him, but when it was absolutely necessary, and never long: that I was come, to assure him of my most du∣tiful affection, and sincere attachment to him, simply, having no engagements to make me look to the right or the left— also, to repeat my readiness to comply with the engagements I had taken with his bro∣ther, which I understood to be with him, and supposed he would continue to ap∣prove:
<PB N="274" REF="286"/>
but that, what had happened, made it necessary to recapitulate them, though he knew them: that the engagements on my side were, to give him all the little in∣terest I had, towards the electing the new Parliament—I did it in the county of Dor∣set, as far as they pleased to push it—I en∣gaged also, specifically, to chuse two mem∣bers for Weymouth, which he desired might be a son of the Duke of Devonshire, and Mr. Ellis, of the Admiralty—I sup∣posed he would confirm that nomination, but that was nothing to me: I was to chuse two, of his nomination, which now was fallen to <HI>him</HI>; so he might name whom he pleased: that I was also engaged to ex∣clude Lord Egmont from Bridgewater, if I could, of which I should give him a far∣ther account, when I knew his pleasure upon this first part: because there might be mention made of that transaction in the closet, and there were some particularities attending it, that, 'twas probable, he migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be acquainted with. He assured m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his friendship and affection, in a solem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and dejected manner; knew his brothe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="275" REF="287"/>
was sincere to me; knew all our engage∣ments, and looked upon himself as party to them; would do every thing in his power to comply with them, and agreed to his brother's nomination of Lord J. Cavendish and Ellis, and hoped they would be agreeable to me.</P>
<P>I proceeded to the article of Bridge∣water, which I said was thus—Long after my mutual engagements with Mr. Pelham, when Lord Egmont made that unfriendly attempt, Mr. Pelham asked me, what would become of it? I said, that it need not af∣fect my election, though it might destroy the Whig interest there, for ever: that the interest was very indifferent to me, as I did not expect to live to see another Par∣liament, and had neither succession, rela∣tion, or friend, that I could or wished to leave it to: but I asked him, if it was in∣different to him, that Lord Egmont should come in there. He said, no, to be sure; and hinted, besides his publick opposition, great distaste to him personally, as if some∣thing very dishonourable had passed be∣tween
<PB N="276" REF="288"/>
them: I avoided entering upon that, and said, that as he thought him his ene∣my, I thought myself obliged to oppose him, where I had any interest; that I was sorry it came so home to me, but that I designed to do it. Some time after that, he told me that the King asked him, if he seriously designed to endeavour to keep Lord Egmont out of Bridgewater, having been told that it would be a matter of some trouble and expence—Mr. Pelham replied, that he could not speak to his Majesty with any authority, but he thought, I would: that I desired him, when next those mat∣ters came to be discussed, to lay me at the King's feet, and tell him, that as I found it would be agreeable to his Majesty, I would spare neither pains nor expence to exclude him: that thus it became my en∣gagement to do it, if I can. That these were the engagements on my side with his brother. He saw, that I had not di∣minished them, and I was fully determined to perform them, let what would fall out on the other side. The Duke was very serious, and dejected, during the whole
<PB N="277" REF="289"/>
conversation, and threw in several warm expressions of approbation, and then said, that he was loaded with too many things at once, for one man to bear: that he had seen, and his brother had told him, how handsome my proceedings had been: that this was the most noble, that could be imagined: that he had transactions with many, but none like this, and beg'd me to say, what his brother had engaged to do; and to tell him all that had passed, and how I understood it. I said, I must be excused; I could not talk about advantages to my∣self, that were to take their rise from my own assertion only, when there was nobody to contradict me: I was afraid, he would have enough of that from others: it was sufficient that he was satisfied, that I had not whittled down the obligations which I was to perform. He pressed me still more strongly; till I told him, that I would not talk of it at all, without remind∣ing him, that I was absolutely determined to fulfil all the engagements I had taken, and repeated to him, without any regard to what might be done on the other side:
<PB N="278" REF="290"/>
that it was the last transaction of my life, and therefore should suffer no ambiguity: they were too far gone to admit of any al∣teration; let what would happen, I could not refine them away; I thought myself bound by them, and would, at all events, perform them: that my proceeding must be as open and clear to the memory of his brother with him, as they would have been with his brother, if we had had the misfortune to lose his Grace: that, even on this footing, I had very little to say; for I was sure, he must know that his brother was to remove the personal misrepresenta∣tions that I lay under, with the King, at a proper time, and to bring me into the service, in a proper manner: that I never thought of fixing him down to a particular day, or a particular office, because indeed I meant more, I meant to come in, so as to live with them as an humble friend, under their friendship and protection. He said, very seriously and warmly, that he would never assert any thing as done, that he was not sure, was done; but as to the King's dis∣like, we might wave that, It was impos∣sible,
<PB N="279" REF="291"/>
but <HI>that</HI> must give way; it could not withstand such a behaviour as mine: we might put it out of the question, with two or three strong expressions more, to that purpose. He then asked me, if his bro∣ther had engaged to bring me in, before the elections were over. I said, he had made me no such promise, that I had never bar∣tered with him, so as to pin him down to a day or an hour, my views being to obtain their friendship, &amp;c. as I had before ex∣plained to him. He said, he always un∣derstood it so, and asked me; as there would be many changes, and that they were obliged to cut the cloth into as many pieces as they could, if I thought, I could come in before the election. I said, I did think I could. He replied, he knew I might be trusted, and would talk very freely to me, and tell me how things stood, since I said, I thought I could come in now: that the Secretary's office was settled, and that he had four positive engagements, which were to Lords Hillsborough, Dupplin, Barring∣ton, and Mr. Nugent: but that he had not, and would not promise any one of
<PB N="280" REF="292"/>
them, till it was done and settled with the King. He then expatiated on the King's kindness to him, which, however, he at∣tributed great part of to the exigencies of the times: that his Majesty had advised him not to promise, and that he replied, that he should take great care not to have himself quoted against himself. I said, I understood that the Secretary's office was designed for Sir Thomas Robinson. He said, yes, and that for the business of the Northern Province, [N. B. He is to have the Southern Province] no man in England understood it better; that he was not hap∣py at explaining himself, but no man knew more, or had better understanding. I said, I knew him very well, he was a worthy man, and I loved him. I said, what if I came into the place he left? He considered a little, and said, very well, pray go on. I said, I would particularly support him in the House, <HI>where</HI> he would chiefly want it. He said, he knew he would. I said, there is my old place, Treasurer of the Navy; that must be vacant: I should like that better than any thing. But, I added, why
<PB N="281" REF="293"/>
should I enter into these things, I leave it wholly to your Grace. He said, that, by a strange fatality, the direction of the House of Commons was fallen upon him, who had never thought of it; and he must expect, that the great attempt would be, to shew that he could not direct it: there∣fore he could not chuse by affection, but must comply with those who could sup∣port him <HI>there</HI>. I said, I understood so, and that I thought, I might pretend to some abilities that way: that in the op∣position, I was thought of some use there: that in Court indeed, I never undertook much, because he knew I never was sup∣ported: but now, when I should be sup∣ported, I hoped I might pretend to be as useful there, as my neighbours. He said, it was incontestably so. I said, that I would derogate from nobody, but considering the superiority of age, the offices I had gone through, and my rank in the world; and adding to that, chusing six members for them at my own great expence, without the expence of one shilling from their side, I thought the world in general, and even
<PB N="282" REF="294"/>
the gentlemen themselves, could not ex∣pect that their pretensions should give me the exclusion. He said, that what I did, was very great—that he often thought with surprise, at the ease and cheapness of the election at Weymouth—that they had no∣thing like it. I said, I believed there were few who could give his Majesty six mem∣bers for nothing. He said, he reckoned five, and had put down five to my account. I said it was so; but this attempt of Lord Egmont's made it six—he would observe, that I did not pretend to chuse two for Bridgewater: but by Lord Egmont's op∣position, the two members must be entirely owing to me; for if I did not exert my whole force to exclude him, he must come in, and the Court would have but one there. He thanked me, said it was most clear as it was now explained, but he had not considered it in that light. I said, I must be excused from talking any more about myself: that I left it entirely to him, and to the King; that I was fully deter∣mined to make this sacrifice to his Majesty; let him use me as he pleased: that I would
<PB N="283" REF="295"/>
keep out of the way of a personal affront: that I knew I had given no just cause of offence, but that I would not justify with his Majesty—that it was enough that he was displeased, to make me think that I was in the wrong, and to beg him to forget it: I would not even be in the right against him, and I was very sure, I would never again be in the wrong against him, for which I hoped his Grace would be my caution. He said, he would with all his heart. He took me in his arms, and kissed me twice, with strong assurances of affec∣tion and service. I told him, I would go to Mr. Ellis, and acquaint him with his nomination to Weymouth; he desired I would, and from him tell him, that he agreed to his brother's nomination, but not to say any thing by way of compliment.</P>
<P>N. B. When I came in, the Duke had a quire of paper before him, upon which, at the top I saw my name. He took notes of all that passed: called in Roberts, shewed him the paper, and told him, he must write it fair, the notes in one column for his use;

<P>Dr. Sharpe and I set out from Eastbury<MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="April"/> at four o'clock in the morning, for Bridge∣water, where, as I expected, I found things very disagreeably framed.</P>

<P>Came on the election, which I lost by the<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="April"/> injustice of the Returning Officer. The numbers were for Lord Egmont 119, for Mr. Balch 114, for me 105. Of my good votes, 15 were rejected: 8 bad votes for Lord Egmont were received.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="298"/>Left Bridgewater—for ever. Arrived at <MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="April"/>Eastbury in the evening.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="April"/>Arrived at Hammersmith in the evening.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="April"/>I went to the Duke of Newcastle's. Re∣ceived with much seeming affection: thanks for Weymouth, where I had succeeded: sorrow for Bridgewater, where I had not. I told him, that I would give him a detail of that whole transaction, in as clear and short a manner as was possible, if he was then at leasure to receive it: but if not, and he thought it worth mentioning to the King, I would only give him the heads of it, and he might say, that I was to acquaint him with the proofs of those heads, at a meeting which he had appointed on pur∣pose. Accordingly, I began by telling him, that I had done all that was in the power of money and labour, and shewed him two bills for money remitted thither, before I went down, one of 1000<HI>l.</HI> one of 500<HI>l.</HI> besides all the money then in my steward's hands, so that the election would cost me about 2,500<HI>l.</HI> In the next place, if
<PB N="287" REF="299"/>
this election stood, the borough was for ever in Tory hands: that all this was oc∣casioned by want of proper support from the Court, and from the behaviour of the servants of the Crown. Upon Mr. Pel∣ham's death, seeing the multitude of pro∣motions in which no notice was taken of me, and Lord Poulett acting openly against me, with all his might; seeing no check given to him, or encouragement to me, they so strongly concluded the Government to be indifferent, that five out of the Cus∣tom-house officers gave single votes for Lord Egmont. The next head was—that, in spite of all, I had a fair majority of le∣gal votes, for that the Mayor had admitted eight bad votes for Lord Egmont, and re∣fused fifteen good ones for me; so that it was entirely in their own hands, to retrieve the borough, and get rid of a troublesome opponent, if they pleased: that if the King required this piece of service, it was to be done, and the borough put into Whig hands, and under his influence, without any stretch of power; for the cause was so clear and indisputable, that, instead of
<PB N="288" REF="300"/>
wanting their power to support it, nothing but their power could withstand it: that, if it was expected, I would lend my name, and my assistance here and in the country, to rescue the borough, and deliver it into such hands as the King should approve of; but that I, on my own account, would have nothing more to do with it. I had ful∣filled to the utmost the sacrifice of duty which I had promised, and proposed to myself; I desired no retrieval or acquisition of interest, and would absolutely be no farther concerned, than as the canal to con∣vey that borough into his Majesty's dispo∣sition. He replied, that they understood the borough to be lost, and also, that it was entirely a party affair: that Lord Shaftes∣bury had confirmed him in it, and assured him, that the violence of the Tories against me was much inflamed, by the assistance I gave, and offered to give Lord Digby, last summer, at his appearance for the county of Dorset: that they knew Mr. Balch nei∣ther would, nor could support Bridgewater that nobody had acted like me, or consi∣sidered the King and his service, in what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="289" REF="301"/>
had done, and now offered to do, so nobly and disinterestedly, &amp;c. I said, that what I had done was in consequence of what I had declared before to him, viz. to shew my duty to the King, and my earnest desires to pass the rest of my life in his Grace's friend∣ship and protection: that I had backed my fancy, and left the rest to him. He made great professions of good wishes, good will, best endeavours, &amp;c. &amp;c.—which weigh with me as much as the breath they were composed of.</P>
<P>The Master of the Rolls died yesterday.<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="May"/></P>

inspection, all, that they did not direct, would be imputed to her. In a year or two, he must be thought to have a will of his own, and then he would, she hoped, act accordingly. Expressed great slight and disregard for those in office, and her usual dislike for the King. We talked of his ac∣cumulation of treasure, which she reckoned at 4,000,000<HI>l.</HI> I told her, that what was become of it, how employed, where and what was left, I did not pretend to guess; but that I computed the accumulation to be from 12 to 15,000,000<HI>l.</HI> That these things, within a moderate degree, perhaps less than a fourth part, could be proved be∣yond all possibility of denial; and when the case should exist, would be published in controversial pamphlets, if troublesome times should arise, which I hoped in God, would never happen. She was very kind and gracious to me. After dinner. Lord Bathurst and Lord Moreton (whom, with his son and daughter, she saw upon the road, and asked to step in) walked with us: they staid but little, and left us with her, Lady Augusta, and the two Princes; we

conversed till near eleven, when I returned. At home I found a letter from Mr. Balch, acquainting me that he had brought Mr. Burroughs with him, to lay the Bridge∣water business before the Ministry.</P>
<P>We went to town before dinner. I told<MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="May"/> Messrs. Balch and Burroughs, that having laid the whole affair before the Duke of Newcastle upon my arrival, and he having assured me, that he would appoint a time to go through and settle it, which he had neg∣lected to do, I would not go to him: but I advised them to wait on him, and that I thought the best way would be, that Mr. Balch should write a note to acquaint his Grace, that he had brought Mr. Burroughs with him, who, in conjunction with him∣self, was best able to give him an account of the injustice the whole party laboured under, who thought themselves well enti∣tled to his Grace's protection, in obtain∣ing that justice, which they were deter∣mined to prosecute; therefore desired to know when they might wait on him, to lay that whole transaction before him.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="304"/>Parliament opened by commission. I <MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="May"/>took the oaths without doors. Very full House.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="June"/>Waited on the Duke of Dorset. Mr. Balch resolved to write the note I advised (of which I gave him a draught) and send it that night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="June"/>Went to the Duke of Dorset's, and ac∣quainted him with my situation with the Ministry. Went to the House. Mr. West desired to speak with me—said that Mr. Balch had written to the Duke of Newcas∣tle (which letter he shewed me) who had appointed to see him on Thursday; but the Duke desired to see me first. I told him, that I would go to him to-morrow.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="June"/>Went early to the Duke of Newcastle's▪ He told me that he had received a letter from Mr. Balch, but desired to advise with me, before he saw him: that nothing was settled, or he should have sent to me long before: that he was against multiplying petitions, for reasons obvious to me: tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="293" REF="305"/>
he knew nothing of Lord Egmont; but had heard that he sometimes talked as if he was willing to battle it: that if it should be made a point, he did not know, if we were certain of carrying it: that Lord Egmont would make a party: that possi∣bly, the Princess might wish he should be let alone, or at least, that those of the late Prince's servants might be for him. I said, that I had laid this affair fully before him already; that he knew, I had pushed it in the country with such an expence and trouble, and so absolutely, considering it a service which the King (as his brother told me) wished: that it had cost me 3,400<HI>l.</HI> that I was fairly chosen, nor would the Returning Officer have dared not to return me, had he not been encouraged by the servants of the administration: that the borough was lost, and lost solely by a Lord of the Bedchamber and the Custom-house Officers: that they might retrieve it, or not, just as they pleased; leave it in Tory hands, or recover it; get rid of Lord Egmont, as an opponent, or keep him in, as a friend, I should neither be satis∣fied
<PB N="294" REF="306"/>
or dissatisfied with it; I should not be obliged by the one, or disobliged by the other. I dealt clearly with him, and de∣sired to be understood without any ambi∣guity: I had told him this before, and my opinion and resolution was the same. He said, he acknowledged it, and desired me to advise what was to be done. I told him, I could not advise, because I did not know the truth of my own situation; it was time to come to a full explanation upon that head, for it must come to a decision: that I had done all the services in my power, and spent very great sums, of all which they, now, had the benefit: that I had made no bartering bargains, but had done it frankly, with a plain, avowed, and accepted intention to take off the edge of the King's ill grounded resentment, and prove my at∣tachment to his Grace; to shew myself his immediate friend . . . . . . . <HI>a few lines were in this place torn, by an accident from the manuscript</HI> . . . . . . I replied it must come to a conclusion, one way o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another: if after accepting both offer and execution of all I could do, I was to re∣main
<PB N="295" REF="307"/>
under an absolute proscription, and exclusion from all favour, that every other subject of my rank might justly expect, I must do as I could, but it must be ex∣plained and fully. He said, he himself liked to deal explicitly, and to understand clearly what was expected: that he had laid my services before the King in the best man∣ner he could; though some people (of whom he would inform me afterwards) had endeavoured to insinuate to his Ma∣jesty, that I had not the power I pretended to at Weymouth. I asked him, if he him∣self did not tell me in that room, that he had declared to the King, that the borough was redelivered into my hands, on the ex∣press condition to take his election of two, <HI>for that time only? . . . . . . . . this being the opposite side of the leaf, which was mentioned before to have been torn, a few lines are also here wanting</HI> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . he would do it in the best manner he was able: that it had been in∣sinuated, and he had not said, expressly, that he would; but had not said, he would not: that if I had my view upon any par∣ticular
<PB N="296" REF="308"/>
thing, or office, he would move it, and try to get it, in the most cordial man∣ner. I said, as to going to the King, I would postpone that consideration for a minute: that, as to the last, he well knew I never thought of making bargains, that I left that matter totally to him. He said, that there were few things that a man of my rank could accept, and that none of them were vacant. I said, it was true, but I did not impute that to him: that as he was at the head of the Treasury, I should chuse a seat there, if it was vacant, sooner than any thing, but I could not take that; at the same time I beg'd he would observe, that I did not expect to be Privy Seal, if Lord Gower should die; that I did not come to make bargains for this, or that thing, or time: he had forced me, before I went into the West to say, that Sir Tho∣mas Robinson's office, or my own again (both which were <HI>then</HI> vacant) I should like very well; he gave them away without considering me. I desired nobody to be removed, much less to die. He must think that 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year would not make my for∣tune,
<PB N="297" REF="309"/>
with one foot in the grave: that as to rank, I had heard that the King was odd about titles: that I had as much re∣spect for the Peerage as any man, but he could not but see, that, in my situation, without succession or collateral, a Peerage to me, was not worth the expence of new painting my coach: that I desired to pass my life as his attached friend and servant, persuaded that he would, as such, do me favourable justice the first opportunity that offered. He said, that he understood me very well: that I could have no competi∣tor in the House of Commons; I expected then any employment that I could take, which should first fall; and added, I sup∣pose you will be disobliged, if you have not the very first that falls. I demurred a little at the oddness and bluntness of the proposition, and did not well conceive the intention of it, but after a little pause, said, —that is a hard word, my Lord, I do not absolutely say that. There may be, possi∣bly, reasons that my real friendship for him might make me acquiesce in; I will not say so hard a word at once; the case will
<PB N="298" REF="310"/>
speak itself, but it must come to a positive issue—and now, my Lord, I must resume the offer your Grace made of going imme∣diately to the King, to demand a categori∣cal answer, whether he be determined, af∣ter all I have done and spent for his ser∣vice (of which he now reaps the utility) to suffer no return to be made me, when opportunity throws it in the way, but to exclude me from all the advantages I am entitled to, in common with the rest of his subjects, both by my rank and my services? as to his resolution, it must be known, but as you profess your sincere desire, that I should be properly considered, it lies upon you to do it in the best man∣ner, and at the properest time: I do not prescribe to-morrow or the next day, this week or the next; but as this is the only obstacle, it must be known, absolutely, and in a reasonable time: if I am proscribed from amongst all my fellow subjects, I must, and shall submit to the King's plea∣sure with all possible respect: but as your Grace has re-assured me, that you have represented what I have done, fairly and
<PB N="299" REF="311"/>
favourably to him; till I know it from your Grace, I cannot believe that so just and generous a Prince would accept a poor subject's offers of service, and suffer him to carry them into execution, at so great an expence, with a resolution absolutely to exclude him from all sorts of common fa∣vour. I thought it would be what never happened before, or to me only. He said, he would do every thing in his power, and did not imagine it could end so. I told him, that I heartily wished it might not, but it must end one way or another, it must not remain as it was; for I was de∣termined to make some sort of figure in life: I earnestly wished it might be under his protection, but if that could not be, I must make some figure; what it would be, I could not determine yet; I must look round me a little, and consult my friends, but some figure I was resolved to make. He said, he would do his best to settle it to my satisfaction; he did not think it could end in a proscription. I said, I ought to hope so, for my own sake; but if he should not be able to obtain common in∣dulgence
<PB N="300" REF="312"/>
for a friend, whom he favoured and thought useful, and who had given such convincing proofs of his utility, I should be sorry for myself indeed, but I should also be sorry for him too; it was being upon a very indifferent footing in∣deed, I should therefore be very sorry for it, upon his account, as well as my own. He said, he would do his utmost to pre∣vent it from coming to that, for, <HI>now</HI>, he understood me thoroughly. He then de∣sired we might advise together about the Bridgewater affair. I said, I thought that all attempts to quiet the Whig party there would be vain, without beginning to turn out the officers. He seemed very unwilling to go so far; and at last said, that he knew I was a man of honour, and he would trust me with a secret, which I must never re∣veal, not even to the Duke of Dorset; and then, after a multitude of precautions, and exacting engagements of honour from me not to divulge it; he told me, that the truth was, that he had a mind that this petition should not go on; and if I could assist him in bringing it about, he should
<PB N="301" REF="313"/>
be much obliged to me:—but if it should be known, it would be reported and be∣lieved that he had made up with Lord Egmont, which was by no means true, for, upon his honour, he had neither spoken to him, or seen him, or had any negociation with him; for he knew very well, that if the King was informed that the town was resolved to petition, and there were the least grounds to throw out Lord Egmont, he would order him to push it with the ut∣most vehemence. I said, I had often told him it was no cause of mine; be it how it would, I should not take it as matter of payment or dissatisfaction: that I would certainly keep his secret, which, however, every body would see through, if no jus∣tice was done: that I would do all I could with Mr. Balch and the town, to quiet them; but that, without punishing the officers, I feared he would find it imprac∣ticable, which he would better judge of when he saw Messrs. Balch and Burroughs on Thursday. What, if he offered the al∣ternative, and tried to make the giving up the officers, the price of dropping all
<PB N="302" REF="314"/>
farther proceedings? He said, it was a good thought, and he must scramble off as well as he could. So we parted, with usual pro∣testations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="June"/>I saw Messrs. Balch and Burroughs, who had been at the Duke of Newcastle's. His Grace had talked them over, but nothing positive, not so much as punishing the of∣ficers, but he told Mr. Balch that he would send Lord Dupplin to him—While they were with me. Lord Dupplin was at Mr. Balch's, and soon after they met, talked very amicably, and agreed to meet here on Tuesday. This haste to see Mr. Balch, was in order to learn all he could, that he might talk it over with the Duke at Cler∣mont, between Saturday and Tuesday.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="June"/>Went to Lord Hillsborough's. Much talk—first about Bridgewater election:— could not conceive the Duke of Newcastle could have the least difficulty in supporting a petition, and wondered he was not most desirous of it. If not, my friends would certainly support me—I doubted—He said,
<PB N="303" REF="315"/>
that though the tide of politicks might have a little separated people, so that they might not be so ready to follow me in every political point, yet in any thing per∣sonal, he could not doubt, but that the many that had lived with, and been obliged to me, would support me heartily and with all their power. I still doubted. He said that my relations, the Grenvilles and Lytteltons would, and he knew it from themselves.</P>
<P>We thence fell upon other subjects, and he desired to know of me, what I thought of their present situation. I said, I could not judge of it, because I did not know it, but it seemed to me very disjointed. He said, he could not imagine any thing like it: every body of consequence was dissa∣tisfied. I said, I could not conceive that, as they had just had every thing divided amongst them. He said, it was so for all that: he not only knew it to be so, but from his intimacy with them, he knew their reasons, which he would tell me, and would begin with Mr. Pitt. That, in∣deed,
<PB N="304" REF="316"/>
he had no intimacy with him, but was told them by his bosom friend Mr. George Grenville, who was also his: that, indeed, if Mr. Pitt meant money, I might well think, he ought to be satisfied; but, his passion was not money; it was ambi∣tion, power; of which he had no share. This made him very uneasy, which was highly increased by the late promotions. Instead of being acquainted with, and con∣sulted about what was to be done, he was only informed what was done: instead of offering him his share, he received news, that his most inveterate enemy was made Secretary of State; the next post brought him an account that Mr. Fox had refused the seals, and that Sir Thomas Robinson had accepted them. I said, that I supposed, that they did not think Mr. Pitt could possibly undertake an office of fatigue, or an office of business from the state of his health. He said, that Mr. Pitt replied, he himself ought to be the best judge of that: besides, Mr. Legge, who could have no pretence to go before him, was made Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer, just in the same
<PB N="305" REF="317"/>
manner. They should have offered him at least. They should have made him well with the King, who was his enemy, which they had never taken the least care to do. That Legge, George Grenville, and Fox were his (Hillsborough's) intimate friends, and he knew their thoughts from them∣selves; that as to Legge, he acknowledged that he was promoted, though he did not much desire it; however, when he was placed there, he thought that he should be supported: he expected to be as well with the Duke of Newcastle as any body, though he was to act an under part: but he found himself, instead of better, not to be so well with him, as the rest of his collegues; that he knew nothing of what was doing, or to be done, and was not considered at all in any thing: that George Grenville was in the same way of thinking, and ex∣pected very different treatment, from his rank and consideration in the House of Commons: besides, if he had less reason to be displeased, nothing would make him easy, while his great friend, Pitt, was dis∣satisfied: that as to Fox he need say no∣thing:
<PB N="306" REF="318"/>
Fox says, he was offered the seals with proper powers to be at the head of the House of Commons; and the next day, he was told with some roughness, that he was to have none, nor was he to meddle with the conduct of the House, farther than as it related to his office: that he might have accepted with honour, even upon those last conditions; yet having been offered, and having accepted the office upon the first; he must have been a mean rascal to have submitted to the degradation. I asked him, if, considering the suspicious temper of the Duke of Newcastle, he thought the Duke would be willing to leave Fox in the clo∣set, in any station, after what had passed. Lord Hillsborough replied, he believed not; but that Fox would meddle very little, and if he gave no particular offence, he thought the Duke could not get him out; and added, that he and the rest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them should take very little share in busi∣ness, unless there was more trust and com∣munication, than had hitherto appeared.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="June"/>I saw Messrs. Balch and Burroughs, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="307" REF="319"/>
had been with the Duke of Newcastle, and were promised by him, in the strongest terms, that our party should be supported.</P>
<P>Lady Orford staid with me above three<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="June"/> hours. Her business was to lament her misfortunes, for that Mr. Shirley and she were parted, of which she gave me a long account: the whole of which was, that he insisted upon something independent, and that she would part with nothing out of her own power.</P>
<P>Lord Dupplin came to talk about Bridge∣water;<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="June"/> but first, he informed me, that he had told the Duke of Newcastle what I had said about myself; that I had offered a free and unreserved friendship, and that, after what I had done, I thought myself well entitled to the treatment and favour of a friend, and that it must be decided one way or another: that his Grace seemed to desire it, as much as I did. Lord Dupplin added, that he understood it would be set∣tled, and though the Duke did not explain himself positively, yet his Lordship consi∣dered
<PB N="308" REF="320"/>
it as a thing fixed, and which would soon be over. I gave him proper thanks, and said, it could not remain as it did; that the Duke was so generous as to press me to say, what his late brother was en∣gaged for. That I would not speak to my own advantage, when the only person, who could contradict me, was dead: that, in∣deed, there was no bargain for particular things; friendship and connection was what I asked, and Mr. Pelham said, he was equally desirous of it. Lord Dupplin said, he knew that Mr. Pelham, for more than a year before he died, looked upon our union to be as settled, as any connection he had, and always added, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I was the only man of business they had, and he was resolved to attach me to them. I replied that, though I had not said so much to the Duke, Mr. Pelham declared that I had a good deal of marketable war<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (parliamentary interest) and that, if I would empower him to offer it all to the King without conditions, he would be answera∣ble to bring the affair to a good account that, if this engagement had not been taken
<PB N="309" REF="321"/>
the nature of the thing plainly spoke it. Service is obligation, obligation implies return. Could any man of honour profess friendship, accept the offers of his friend's whole services, suffer those services to be carried into execution, avail himself of their whole utility, and then tell that friend, he could not, or he would not make him any return? Could there be such a charac∣ter? Supposing this gentleman had a mas∣ter, whose affairs were promoted by these services, the concurrence of whom was necessary to this return, but who was in∣disposed to his friend; could he answer it to his friend or to the world, when he found his master's resentments irremovea∣ble, if he did not advise his friend to take back his offers, and apply them as he might think best, unless he chose to risque them on an adventure, for the performance of which he could not be answerable? These things spoke themselves, and all mankind must see them in the same light: that, be it how it would, it must be thoroughly understood by the world—If this con∣nection, and the acceptance of my effectual
<PB N="310" REF="322"/>
services, was not ratified by effects that jus∣tified them, I must be contented to pass for a dupe, and they, for sharpers; the world would justly call me fool, and them, by a much harsher name; but for myself, I was prepared to bear it all, let what would happen. I found means to repeat this particular de∣duction and conclusion, two, or three times, in the subsequent conversation. We then fell upon Bridgewater—the Duke of New∣castle would do every thing to support the party: he demurred upon petitioning, only, for fear of making it an handle for forming an improper connection at setting out. I knew that those in considerable places dif∣fered among themselves, and almost all dis∣owned immediate dependence, obligation and allegiance to the Duke, and that they might, on such an occasion, perplex and disturb his Grace. I said, I understood him, and after having strongly represented to him that, what I undertook, I had per∣formed, since he acknowledged I was fairly chosen: that I meant it a service; if they were satisfied, I was: if they desired to make effectual, what their own dependents
<PB N="311" REF="323"/>
had obstructed, I would give my assistance, but that I was wholly unconcerned in their determination: I added, that I did not think this case was liable to the inconve∣niencies which he had mentioned: for that I had reason to think, that Mr. Fox would not espouse, even privately, Lord Egmont against me, though I had not seen him since my return from the West. That I had been pressed by several with offers of ser∣vice, to know if I would petition, that the Grenvilles, &amp;c. had given me to under∣stand, that they would not only be for me, but actively so: that I would own to him in confidence, that I myself wished there might be no petition: that the Duke might think it no ill bargain, if he could <HI>get</HI> Lord Egmont, by suffering him to sit only, with∣out any farther pretensions upon his Grace, and, perhaps, I might think so too: but I thought it impracticable; for if I was in his Grace's confidence, I should be obliged to tell him, that, if Lord Egmont subscribed to that bargain, when the fourteen days for petitioning were expired, if the Duke did not engage to gratify his Lordship (which
<PB N="312" REF="324"/>
would be no easy matter) the fifteenth day, it was my opinion, that he would break with his Grace on the sixteenth. Lord Dupplin said much of Lord Egmont's falseness and ill behaviour to Mr. Pelham, who told him, that he was so gross a flat∣terer, when he brought him in for Weo∣bly, that it was quite shocking, and Mr. Pelham shewed him a letter from Lord Egmont, in which he writes, that he was happy in having found a man, in whom he he could have an <HI>implicit faith</HI>, with a great deal more of this kind. He then entered into the means of managing this affair of Bridgewater. I said, I could say but little to it, after what I had said; that my being in their confidence, or not, must and would chiefly decide of the complexion of that business. He replied, he always looked upon that as done, and to be sure, that must be decided, before any measures could be taken with effect. I told him, that one way came across me, and only one, to make all things easy, but charged him, as a man of honour, never to mention it, as a thought or suggestion of mine; because it was not
<PB N="313" REF="325"/>
so much as my wish, and the suggestion might be construed to imply the wish: that the expedient was, if any thing should happen, or be formed, to make room for me in the service, before the meeting of Parliament, that would vacate my seat, and I could neither petition nor stand for Bridgewater—but I enjoined him never to mention this (for it struck him much, and made him, for a few minutes, very thought¦ful) as coming from me, for I really meant it, only as a pleasantry, between him and me, that rose on a sudden.</P>
<P>I went to town to see Lord Dupplin,<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="July"/> about the Bridgewater business. He said, he had told the Duke of Newcastle all that had passed between us, and had explained the nature of the friendship I offered, in contradistinction to the inconnection and inconfidence of others in office: that the Duke approved of, and desired it, and meant to affect it; that he pressed his Grace to end it with the King; for when the pro∣scription was taken off, and the King had accepted me, the Duke might then declare,
<PB N="314" REF="326"/>
that I was in his confidence, and under his protection, and that he was at liberty, and would do me justice, the first opportunity that might happen: and then he (Lord Dupplin) could have the pleasure of com∣municating every thing, he knew and heard, confidentially to me, and should consider me and himself, and the Attorney and Stone, (which last was present when he talked to the Duke) as one person. I said, I could not imagine any reason why Stone should be indisposed towards me. He cried, in∣disposed! very much the contrary; he de∣sires it greatly, and so do all the Duke of Newcastle's friends. I replied, if it ended otherwise, it would be the most scandalous transaction that ever appeared to the world, and appear it must. He said, it could not end ill—he looked upon it as done, for he desired me to observe, that the Duke did not hold up the King at all, or so much as insinuate that he apprehended any difficulty from his Majesty. I beg'd Lord Dupplin to press the Duke to make an end of it, be∣fore I went into the West, and that I would
<PB N="315" REF="327"/>
wait on him before I sat out, and earnestly requested that it might be entirely settled.</P>
<P>I went to the Duke of Newcastle's. Af∣ter<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="July"/> his Grace had talked indecisively about Bridgewater, of which I gave him the hear∣ing, I desired to know positively, what I was to expect: he replied, and told me, that he had laid all my services before the King in the fullest manner, but it did not satisfy him: that his Majesty endeavoured to lessen my credit at Weymouth—that the Duke replied, that he thought his Majesty himself had told him, that the borough was put into my hands, at the renewal of of the charter, on condition of his naming two members for that time only. The King could not deny it; but upon the whole, he would not receive me to any mark of his favour. I said, that, as it was so, I received his Majesty's displeasure with that respect and resignation, which became me towards my Sovereign: that, after such offers received, and suffered to be carried into execution, at the expence of nearly 4000<HI>l.</HI> I did not believe such a con∣clusion
<PB N="316" REF="328"/>
had ever happened: but I submit∣ted, and must act as opportunity and acci∣dents should direct. The Duke expressed much sorrow; protested the sincerity of his endeavours, and said, that what would not do one day might do another. I replied, that I could not judge of that; but if he imagined, that I would remain postulating among the common herd of suitors, and expose myself to suffer twenty unwor∣thy preferences more, to get, perhaps, no∣thing at last, certainly nothing that I wanted, —it was impossible; I would as soon wear a livery, and ride behind a coach in the streets. I repeated these words again in the course of the conversation. We parted very civilly.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="July"/>I called on the Attorney General, and told him what had passed, and desired him to be a witness, that I looked upon myself, as free from all engagements, after such a return; and I expected to have no hints thrown out of breach of faith, &amp;c. what∣soever party I might take. He replied, that I was undoubtedly free, but he could
<PB N="317" REF="329"/>
not believe, it would end so. He protested, he was sure that the Duke of Newcastle had represented every thing in the most favourable manner, though he should not wonder, if I did not believe it. I said, that, all things considered, it was pretty hard to believe it. He replied, he agreed to that, and if they, on their side, did not return to the charge, till they carried their point, he would believe so too: they must do it, &amp;c. which was very civil and insignificant.</P>
<P>I went to Eastbury.<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="July"/></P>
<P>Returned to Hammersmith.<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Sept."/></P>
<P>I called upon Lord Hillsborough, and<MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Oct."/> had much free talk with him. Nobody in office satisfied, or would act beyond their particular department. Nobody im∣powered, or that would take the lead. Mr. Pitt had seen the Duke of Newcastle for an hour, and returned to Bath. The Duke would have entered with him into the American expedition, to dislodge the French from the Ohio: Mr. Pitt said, <HI>your
<PB N="318" REF="330"/>
Grace</HI>, I suppose, <HI>knows I have no capacity for these things</HI>, (being dissatisfied that he was not made Secretary of State) and there∣fore I do not desire to be informed about them. He is likely to resign, but not to go into opposition. Fox and Pitt are so far agreed, that they are willing, that the first should be at the head of the Treasury, and the other Secretary of State: but nei∣ther will assist the other. I asked, if that was not a virtual union. Lord Hillsborough replied, 'twas near it: Mr. Pelham had the address to play the one against the other; but the Duke had not. He had had some talk with the Duke about this, who told him, all would go well, let them do the duty of their offices. The Duke said, he had informed the King, that he had not much to expect from his first rank in the House of Commons (meaning Fox, Pitt, Legge, Grenville) but that he had an ex∣cellent second rank (meaning him (Hills∣borough,) Barrington, Dupplin, Nugent, Charles Townshend, &amp;c.) That West, Se∣cretary of the Treasury, had been with him, and expressed his opinion that they could
<PB N="319" REF="331"/>
not go on: that he saw many of the city, and it was an unanimous opinion they could not—that opinion, however founded, was of great weight: that he had told this to the Duke, who said, you know nothing of the matter, all will go well. The King does not speak to the Duke of Dorset; yet, it is possible, he may go again to Ireland. The Duke of Grafton wishes to send his son in law, the Earl of Hertford, thither. All this is astonishing!—</P>
<Q>From Oct. <HI>10, 1754,</HI> to April <HI>22, 1755,</HI> the Diary seems to have been discontinued.</Q>
<P>I passed the evening at Leicester House.<MILESTONE N="1755."/> The Princess was clear, that the Duke of<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="May"/> Newcastle could not stand as things were. She desired it might be understood, that her house had no communication with New∣castle House; but not that she said it, be∣cause it would be told at St. James's, at which place she desired to avoid all disputes.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt came to Lord Hillsborough's,<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="May"/> where was Mr. Fox, who stepping aside,
<PB N="320" REF="332"/>
and Mr. Pitt thinking he was gone, the latter declared to Lord Hillsborough, that all connection between him and Mr. Fox was over—that the <HI>ground was altered</HI>— that Fox was of the Cabinet and Regent, and he was left exposed, &amp;c.—that he would be <HI>second</HI> to <HI>nobody</HI>, &amp;c. Mr. Fox rejoining the company, Mr. Pitt, being heated, said the same and more to him; that if Fox succeeded, and so made way for him, he would not accept the seals of Secretary from him, for that would be owning an obligation and superiority, which he would never ackowledge: he would owe nothing but to himself;—with much more in very high language, and very strange discourse. Mr. Fox asked him, what would put them upon the same ground; to which Pitt re∣plied, a winter in the Cabinet and a sum∣mer's Regency.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="May"/>Pitt talked the same over again to Lord Hillsborough, who endeavoured to soften matters, but Pitt was unalterable, and de∣sired Lord Hillsborough, as a friend, to take an opportunity of telling Mr. Fox,
<PB N="321" REF="333"/>
that he wished there might be no farther conversation between them on the subject; that he esteemed Mr. Fox, but that all con∣nection with him was at an end.</P>
<P>☞In 1741 the King was at Hanover, and the French marched 42,000 men into West∣phalia. Bussy was sent with a convention of neutrality for Italy, which was signed in September 1741—the consequence was, that 15,000 Spaniards passed under Had¦dock's nose. If the same should now hap∣pen, and a neutrality for both Indies be demanded?</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what had passed at<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="May"/> Lord Hillsborough's, Messrs. Fox and Pitt have had another conference, not so alien∣ating, but not satisfactory. I have seen neither, and so do not know the particu∣lars.</P>
<P>I was with the Princess, by her order:<MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="May"/> we had much conversation, both in the morning and evening, in which, I think, all was said that my memory could suggest
<PB N="322" REF="334"/>
to me upon the present state of affairs—the weakness, meanness, cowardice, and base∣ness of the Duke of Newcastle—to all which she ecchoed in the strongest terms— the impossibility of his standing without a new system—of this too, she declared, she was fully convinced, and that she was so persuaded of his falseness and low cunning, that if she designed to go into the next room, she would not trust him with it, if she meant it should not be known. I laid before her the necessity of a new system, for that I found poople would not bear the present: that I believed no new one was formed, but that I saw there was such a disposition, as must end in one, of some sort or another: that what retarded it most was, that people were guessing at <HI>her</HI>, and were tender of pushing any thing that she might be disobliged by, and resent another day: that I myself had entered into no engagements with any body, and was not fond of doing it, but that I was upon such a foot with the most efficient, that they would scarcely come to any fixed plan, without acquainting me with it: that I
<PB N="323" REF="335"/>
thought it absolutely necessary to attempt a settlement, not only for the present, but which might, with small alterations, last, when a <HI>certain event</HI> took place; for it would be a melancholy thing, if under a young King and the pressure of a war, when efficiency and immediate action was re∣quired, instead of consulting <HI>what</HI> was to be done, we must be struggling <HI>who</HI> should do it: that, therefore, it was to be wished, that some system, so mixed as not to be disagreeable to her, should be conveyed to the Duke of Newcastle, with intimation that, if he would embrace it, he might not only be supported <HI>now</HI>, but find protection <HI>another day:</HI> if he refused it, he must be left to his enemies, and expect no support either now, or then: that my meaning was, to lead the King into it, without his know∣ing it, and make him consent under the idea of making his own affairs easy, and that he should not know from whence it arose, or the extent of it: that I wished to avoid all disturbances; and it was that, and that alone, which made me think of any thing, that was to continue such a crea∣ture
<PB N="324" REF="336"/>
as the Duke of Newcastle at the head of affairs, even for an hour, either now or then. She signified her entire approbation of all I had said, by several short interrup∣tions, and then said, that she was, and long had been much affected with the melan∣choly prospect of her own and her son's affairs: that such a settlement, as I men∣tioned, was doubtless much to be desired, but how was it to be obtained? there were a hundred good reasons that tied her hands from interfering with the King; those of her children were obvious enough; and if she was to stir, it would make things worse; she saw no way to extricate herself. I re∣plied, that the case was extremely delicate: that whenever I thought of it, I laid it down, that something must be done, and yet, that she must neither be seen nor heard in it: that, upon so delicate a foundation, such a sort of confidence was required to act, that was above my capacity, and such a one that I did not aspire to: that I thought men were wanting: that, I was satisfied, the nation had, still, great resources, and that even parts were not wanting, but cha∣racter
<PB N="325" REF="337"/>
and experience in business was: that the Duke of Newcastle had the ball at his foot, when his brother died, and he might have made a lasting and advantageous settle∣ment for himself and the country, but he had not endeavoured to oblige one efficient man, besides his known enemies: that there was no violence, no oppression, no particular complaint, and yet the nation was sinking by degrees, and there was a general indisposition proceeding from the weakness and worthlessness of the minister, who would embrace every thing, and was fit for nothing. She answered, that she was glad to hear me say that the nation had still great resources—for people told her it was undone—but she did not think so, yet, if there were both resources and parts too, and they could not both be exerted, what would they avail? She saw, and much la∣mented the consuming state of the nation, which I mentioned: it was of infinite consequence how a young reign began, and it made her very uneasy. She was highly sensible how necessary it was, that the Prince should keep company with men:
<PB N="326" REF="338"/>
she well knew that women could not i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦form him, but if it was in her power ab¦solutely, to whom could she address him▪ What company could she wish him to keep What friendships desire he should contract▪ Such was the universal profligacy, such th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> character and conduct of the young peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of distinction, that she was really afraid t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have them near her children. She shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even be in more pain for her daughters than for her sons, if they were private per¦sons, for the behaviour of the women wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indecent, low, and much against their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interest, by making themselves so ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cheap. This and much more (with no very high opinion of the King) took up abov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two hours. About six, after drinking cof∣fee with Lady Charlotte Edwin, we wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent for to walk. The ceremony of the day seemed to be, to leave the Princess to me, for the young Princesses and the com∣pany always kept before, or behind us. Having made the tour of the ground, and being shewn the improvements, she pro∣posed going into the King's gardens: there, she again renewed the same subjects; we
<PB N="327" REF="339"/>
talked of several private characters; the general indisposition; the danger of the war; and then of the inability of the Duke of Newcastle, her dislike and contempt of him; the impossibility of his standing, as as he was now circumstanced. Something should be thought of, and soon—the sum∣mer was the time, the winter was not so proper for concerting measures. I replied that, indeed, in summer people's steps were not so much observed, and, particu∣larly, in this summer, as the King was abroad. She again expressed her astonish∣ment at the Duke of Newcastle's conduct, and said, she could not conceive who were, really and truly, the persons whose advice he chiefly depended upon. I replied, I had never heard of any body, but those whom publick same had made notorious, who were Messrs. Murray and Stone. She said, if it was so, they were very bad poli∣ticians, unless it was true, that they were at bottom the Jacobites, they were so strongly represented to be, and gave their advice to carry on the consuming system. I said, it was impossible; for their under∣standing,
<PB N="328" REF="340"/>
their actions, and, above all, their interest made it so. She answered, that nobody but God could judge of the heart, and that, for her part, she did not give any credit to those reports: she spoke in favour of Murray's abilities; but nothing, one way or the other, of Stone. She men∣tioned two things, which were remarkable from the inferences: the first, talking of what the Duke of Newcastle ought to do; but then, says she, he will say, the <HI>party</HI> will not come into it; the <HI>party</HI>, this; and the <HI>party</HI>, that: but I could never understand what the party was; I have endeavoured to learn, and I could never find, that the party was any thing else, but the Duke of De∣vonshire, and his son, and old Horace Wal∣pole. The Duke of Devonshire was the cause of the Duke of Cumberland's being in the Regency this time, and he insisted upon his being left sole Regent, at a meet∣ing, where were the Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Grafton, Lord Waldegrave, and old Horace Walpole. The second was, on my commending the Prince's figure, and saying he was much
<PB N="329" REF="341"/>
taller than the King, she replied, yes, he was taller than his uncle. I said, in height it might be so, but if they measured round, the Duke had the advantage of him. She answered, it was true, but she hoped it was the only advantage that he, ever, would have of him.</P>
<P>In the half hour between her Royal Highness's dressing and dinner, Mr. Cresset did me the favour to come to me, and to my very great surprise, entered, at once, into the wretched management and inabilities of the Duke of Newcastle: he repeated what the Princess had before said, and added, the monstrous expence of the present armament, and yet insufficient; it was well made by those who had it in charge, when they were permitted to act; but it was infinitely blameable in the Mi∣nister, who delayed that permission so long, and thereby occasioned this vast, unneces∣sary expence in arming. Why not be pre∣pared, or at least forward in your prepara∣tions, in the autumn? Then every thing might have been done completely, and at
<PB N="330" REF="342"/>
the usual expence. It was impossible to stand as it was—for the same would happen, when the war came upon the Continent in Europe—Hanover must be protected, but it would be in the same way; a number of expensive, useless engagements entered into in a hurry, too great for the country to bear, and yet, by that hurry, ineffectual to the end, which might be attained by a reasonable plan and upon reasonable terms. Just so, was the last war, ruinous in the expence, and unsuccessful in the end, for want of consideration and a reasonable plan at the beginning. But it was easily seen, that <HI>all was going one way:</HI> that it was a sad prospect for those who wished well to the Prince: that the poor Princess was very uneasy about it.</P>
<P>☞All this is so; and it is as certain, that the Duke is full as much indisposed to the Duke of Newcastle as the Princess; and the amount of all will be—<HI>Nothing</HI>.</P>
<P>The King, the Princess, the Duke, and the chief people in employment; all, ex∣cept
<PB N="331" REF="343"/>
the King; all avowedly hate and des∣pise the Duke of Newcastle. The King delegates his power to him. The Princess and the Duke, (from trifling dislikes in my opinion) and the principal people in em∣ployment, from this strange situation of the Royal family, and from great unwil∣lingness to venture their emoluments, can∣not unite in bringing about the <HI>single thing</HI> in which, perhaps, they all agree. Is not this political prodigy a surer prognostick of the fall of a state, than a comet?</P>
<P>During a visit at Horton for two days,<MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="May"/> I had much conversation with Lord Halli∣fax. We entirely agreed in the insufficiency, falseness, and meanness of the Duke of Newcastle's administration: and we much lamented the imminent necessity of the contrary conduct, in the present dangerous state of our country. The remedy we could not find, though we agreed that neither the Duke nor the country could go on, without other management or other hands. I advised his Lordship to think of it se∣riously. He said, the Duke of Newcastle
<PB N="332" REF="344"/>
was his near relation; he wished him well, had served him honestly, had asserted the rights of his own office, but had entered into no cabals against him: that the Duke had sometimes used him kindly, and some∣times, otherwise; had sometimes obliged him, and, sometimes, granted in such a manner not to oblige: that he had frankly told his Grace all this, and had pressed upon him, that it was impossible to pro∣ceed with these hands, obliged as he might think them; but disobliged, as they them∣selves thought, or, at least, professed to think: that he would press him again, though without hopes of success. Lord Hallifax owned, he saw nothing to help the Duke, but my friends, Talbot and Dashwood, and me. I said, that I did not know how he could gain us, unless he could shew us a real intention to extricate this country from the distress, he himself had so much contributed to bring upon it; and then, that he (Hallifax) should have the seals, with sufficient authority to carry those intentions into execution, or else, that he would engage with us to force his
<PB N="333" REF="345"/>
Grace to a compliance. He then added, that he had represented the usage he had met with, to the Duke, both as his near relation and his friend—The unworthy preferences—Lord Holderness, incapable —then, Mr. Fox—then. Sir Thomas Ro∣binson, every way most unfit—his making Mr. Fox of the Cabinet, which he before, had refused him, under pretence that the King would not consent to it—his allow∣ing Mr. Pitt's claim to the seals of Secre∣tary, by making excuses, and laying it wholly upon the King's dislike—his ex∣pressing much alienation to Messrs. Pitt, Fox, and the Grenvilles, on account of the arrogance of the first, and of the falseness and cunning of the second, who would deceive the Duke of Newcastle by pretend∣ing to be his friend. I said, that the Duke would deceive himself, for Mr. Fox did not pretend to do it, and would be sorry to have it thought so, as he had declared, he neither had, nor would have any obliga∣tion to him. But that it behoved him (Hallifax) not to acquiesce under the pre∣tensions of either; for, by that means, they
<PB N="334" REF="346"/>
would become realities against him, and, in case of any alterations (which appeared unavoidable) they would acquire a foun∣dation, if not success. He said, that, un∣less the Duke of Newcastle made a new system, he could not go on; but if those should succeed, it would be a very flimsy and short administration, for neither the nation, nor the people of quality would confide in either of them. Lord Hallifax added, that he had felt the danger of suf∣fering those groundless pretensions to be established, but knew not how to prevent them—and therefore he had told the Duke of Newcastle, that, since he saw his Grace would not trust him in business, and was continually putting people before him, he expected some mark of distinction, and de∣manded the Garter: that the Duke boggled at it, and said Lord Carlisle was to have it: that Lord Northumberland insisted upon it: that he would do his best, but that he (Hallifax) had no friend at Court but him∣self. To which Lord Hallifax replied, he did no know what his Grace meant by that—that, indeed, he never thought it
<PB N="335" REF="347"/>
necessary to apply to whores and knaves; but, in short, he must have it, or quit his office—he did not care it should appear to be done in a pique for both their sakes, and therefore desired the Duke would pro∣pose it, and insist upon it, to the King; and if his Majesty absolutely refused it, that the Duke, upon honour, would tell him so, and he would then take a proper time to quit the service, which would pre∣vent its appearing to the world, that the Duke had not the power of a Minister, or that he himself had laid down out of re∣sentment. The Duke said, he would not for the world draw such a thing upon his Majesty, but that he would do his best to serve him. I said, I wished he had put his weight rather upon a share of government, and a power to serve his country at this exigence. He replied, it was nothing; he was persuaded that the Duke had never mentioned it to the King. He testified much kindness and protestations of friend∣ship, and desires to unite and act with me and mine. He also observed, that the Duke trusted the Chancellor no more than him,
<PB N="336" REF="348"/>
and suffered difference of opinion from him as impatiently.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="May"/>I had a long conversation with Lord Temple, who took great pains to persuade me, that they were all very well satisfied with Mr. Fox; though to jealous minds there might be pretence for suspicion, from the appearances and the consequences of their different conduct: they are desperate with the King, and have not yet been able to get possession, either of Leicester House or of the Duke of Cumberland.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="June"/>Mr. Fox spent the morning with me. We had a good deal of talk to no purpose. None of them dare come to any resolution. He was assured by the Duke of Argyll, that Stone was not well with the Princess. He heard by West, that the Duke of New∣castle, upon West's pressing him to make up with him (Fox), said, that Stone was always advising the same thing, and had lost himself at his own court on that ac∣count. He said, that the Duke was with the Princess on the 22d instant, and pro∣posed
<PB N="337" REF="349"/>
to her, taking the Prince with him to Portsmouth; which she approved of, and desired him to ask the Prince himself—he did so, and the Prince agreed to it, but not with so much eagerness as might be ex∣pected. On Monday, Lord Waldegrave sent word he would wait on the Duke to settle the journey on Tuesday morning; but, in the mean time, the Princess had altered her opinion and sent to put it off, on pretence it might give umbrage to the King. Fox refines and is much dissatisfied with this transaction: the Duke does not, and says it is only from a resolution she has taken, not to be accountable for any thing with his Majesty. But Fox is very uneasy, and very solicitous to unite the Duke and the Princess, which is the only sure ground; but I think it will be exceed∣ingly difficult, if not impossible to effect.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax told me, that the Duke of<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July"/> Newcastle had mentioned his resolution of coming to some settlement: that Mr. Pitt did not absolutely insist upon being Secre∣tary; but that there was a great unwilling∣ness
<PB N="338" REF="350"/>
to speak out: that he (Hallifax) did not wonder at it. If the Duke was not in earnest, why did he send him such positive terms or desire a conference? Could he think, that Pitt would open himself upon hints, and to such a messenger as Mr. Yorke? That the Duke, in a former con∣ference, had expressed himself, "how much concern it gave him, that I should make a speech against him—his resolution to make up with me—enquiries when I went into Dorsetshire, and that, in this conference, he cried out of himself, we must have Dod∣dington." Thus far Lord Hallifax—and to render intelligible what follows, and may follow, with relation to Mr, Pitt, I will throw out what I know of his situation all together. His extraordinary conversa∣tion with Mr. Fox, at Lord Hillsborough's, may be seen under May 9th. The other conference at Holland House, though somewhat more courtly, was not more sa∣tisfactory, and has never been renewed. It seems that, a little before the King went to Hanover, old Horace Walpole, either officiously, or being sent, tried to bring
<PB N="339" REF="351"/>
Mr. Pitt into temper, with hints that the Duke of Newcastle desired it, and would have done every thing in his power to serve him according to his wishes, and therefore he must not be inflexible, &amp;c. Pitt re∣plied, he was not, and did not insist upon the seals now, but would be contented, as a proof of the Duke's sincerity, if he would take off all marks of proscription, that the King should agree that, when any va∣cancy happened, he should have the seals, and should, in the mean time, treat him upon that foot. In this way, he would not desire any vacancy should be made for him. Old Horace seemed to give into this; and here, let me insert, that Fox had heard from Lord Hartington, who was informed by old Horace himself, that the Duke of Newcastle was very angry with Horace, for having advanced so far, and said, he had gone farther than his commission, or than the Duke could go, if he would, or would go, if he could. Then came on these extraordinary conferences, which, I confess, I do not yet understand. I know Mr. Fox imputes it to a design of Pitt,
<PB N="340" REF="352"/>
to fix himself with the Princess, and that, <MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="July"/>in order to do it, it became necessary to de∣clare off with him, as the Duke of Cum∣berland's man. But I do not think so; it is too refined for me, as nobody but Cres∣set (if he is) is in a settled confidence of measures with the Princess, and so I told him.</P>
<P>In this state then, I suppose, Mr. Yorke sound Mr. Pitt, when he appeared so cold, as the Duke represented him to Lord Hal∣lifax, when he sounded him by his Grace's order. But the real overture and answer was, as Mr. James Grenville told me, from Mr. Pitt in effect, (though not avowedly) great assurances of friendship and affection—re∣solution to bring about every thing he wished, as soon as possible—desirous that they might talk together, and they should soon agree, &amp;c.—this was not by positive message, but by insinuation. The answer was, that as to friendship and confidence, that was entirely over; it was loss of time to talk any more in that style: that if even those assurances were to be carried into
<PB N="341" REF="353"/>
execution and were realities, it was a doubt whether they would be accepted: that he would not take, nor hold any thing as a favour from the Duke of Newcastle, nor ever will owe him any obligation: that therefore he saw no use in meetings or con∣ferences. But if the Duke was really in earnest, and meant any thing, why did he not propose plainly the three things—What was the work he expected to be done? Who were the gentlemen he proposed to do it? And in what stations he designed them to act? When he, Pitt, was clearly informed of those three points, he should be able to give an answer, after he had con∣sulted his friends, gentlemen of honour and efficiency, whether it was to be under∣taken or not, and upon what terms.</P>
<P>I dined with the Duke of Argyll at Mr.<MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="July"/> Fox's. When the company was gone, Fox told me, he was sure that Mr. Pitt had made up with the Princess, and had it in view, when he declared off with him: that he had long cultivated (above six months) an acquaintance with one, no way
<PB N="342" REF="354"/>
connected with the Duke of Newcastle, with whom he had had the first confidential conference, since he saw me: that Pitt in talking of things of that court, I think he called it his court, to that person, he said he had heard that Stone was not so well there as usual: what could be the reason of it? The person answered, shall I tell you? I fear you will not like it; but as you command me, I will tell you. I take it to be from thinking him too much in your interest. The same person told him (who sometimes converses with Cres∣set) that Mr. Pitt was better at that court than usual: to what degree, or by what means he did not know; but that he found Cresset spoke more favourably of him, than he used to do. Fox continued then to say, that Lord Egmont, was thought to have the chief management there; and that the Prince was much fonder of that Lord, than of any other man living. I said, that Mr. Pitt might have sent offers of service, per∣haps by Lady Charlotte Edwin, whom my women relations, the Grenvilles and Tem∣ples, have been courting all the winter,
<PB N="343" REF="355"/>
and that they might have been very civilly received and returned: but, that there had been any communication, or proposition of measures between them, or even an au∣dience, I did not believe. I might proba∣bly think there were no settled measures, but if there were, I thought that neither Pitt nor Egmont had the secret or the ma∣nagement of them, but Cresset only. What then could this transaction, either real or imaginary, amount to but refinement? Could it influence Mr. Pitt's acting in publick? or his (Fox's) in consequence? Then we entered into the present state of affairs; and he told me, that the courier, that came the 28th, past, with the answer from Hanover, which was expected to be a decisive one as to the sailing of the fleet, brought back a letter, which was neither written by Lord Holderness, nor dictated by the King, but which was certainly sent from hence by the Duke of Newcastle (to gain so much time for inaction) as a proper return for the King to make. For it ac∣quainted them, that the King cannot give any positive orders about the operations of
<PB N="344" REF="356"/>
the fleet, till he was fully informed of three particular things, which he (Fox) said he had forgotten, but they were trifles: that those trifles were answered, and his Ma∣jesty was humbly advised to leave the di∣rection of the fleet to their discretion; and that, by the return of the courier, he had done so: that now, till they had digested something positive, they agreed to send an order to Sir Edward Hawke, that he should sail with about sixteen ships of the line to Torbay, and there expect farther instruc∣tions: that these farther instructions were to be drawn up by Lord Anson and Sir Thomas Robinson: that the Duke of Cum∣berland had said, if they had any prospect of a peace, he had nothing to say; but if they were convinced it must be war, he had no notion of not making the most of the strength and opportunity we had in our hands: that, afterwards, in a window with the Dukes of Marlborough and New∣castle, the latter said, that, what his Royal Highness had declared, was full of very good sense, though he was not entirely of the same opinion: that Lord Granville was
<PB N="345" REF="357"/>
absolutely against meddling with trade— he called it, vexing your neighbours for a little muck—but that the Duke of New∣castle was by no means of that opinion, but thought some middle way might be sound out. He was asked, what way? He an∣swered, that, to be sure, Hawke must go out; but that he might be ordered not to attack the enemy, unless he thought it worth while. He was answered, that Hawke was too wise to do any thing at all, which others, when done, were to pronounce he ought to be hanged for. The Duke re∣plied, what if he had orders not to fall upon them, unless they were more in number together than ten? He was answered, that the returned part of the Brest squadron, now at Lisbon, is but nine. The Duke said, he meant <HI>that</HI> of merchantmen only, for, to be sure, he must attack any squadron of ships of war. He was asked, what was a squadron? He said, three ships or more. This absurdity is inconceivable. What or∣ders they will give to Hawke to-morrow, I shall not go out of my way to enquire.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="358"/>Mons. de Mirepoix sat out about one <MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="July"/>o'clock this morning. The sole question is, whether France will submit to purchase the getting home her trade and sailors, and having the winter to tamper with Spain, at a little loss of reputation, in tamely suffer∣ing an insult for a while—If she should, I verily think his Grace would not be in∣clined to be rude. But the departure of Mons. de Mirepoix looks as if the French would take it up with a high hand, and this may render Hawke's instructions some∣thing more explicit. Mr. Fox assured me of one thing yesterday, which surprised me much: he said, that the Russians, hitherto, had refused our subsidy; as also, that the Queen of Hungary had absolutely refused, not only our money, but to have any thing to do with us, saying, it is our own quar∣rel and she will not be concerned in it. She is sure, that the French will not med∣dle with her, and therefore she will send no troops into Flanders, even if we would be at the whole expence. He added, that, upon his telling his Royal Highness, that the Duke of Newcastle was for a naval war,
<PB N="347" REF="359"/>
his Royal Highness laughed at him, and said, it was, because he could get nobody to take his money, and that he ordered, of his own authority, that more money should be offered to the Russians, than the Re∣gency knew of, or even the King; (as he supposed.) I pressed Fox much (who did not seem to feel the force of it) to try if he could fix such a fact on the Duke of New∣castle, which is not only criminal in itself, but if it was approved of afterwards, would be sufficient to frighten him out of his wits, for having acted extra-provincially. I was surprised, that Fox did not see it in the same light, and I shall press him again.</P>
<P>I saw Lord Temple at Carleton House,<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="August"/> who assured me, that neither Mr. Pitt nor himself, knew, or had heard one word more, than what Mr. James Grenville had acquainted me with. I also saw Mr. Fox there, who told me, that the Duke of New∣castle was angry with the Duke, and would hardly speak to his Royal Highness; and that he himself (Fox) had not changed a word with his Grace since he saw me last:
<PB N="348" REF="360"/>
that the Hessian treaty was signed, and that Hawke's orders were of the compromising kind—and this is all that is weak and ruinous.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="August"/>Lord Hallifax was with me. He was with the Duke of Newcastle at dinner on Saturday, and yesterday again, by the Duke's desire. His Grace did not tell him Hawke's instructions, but he finds, that they are not to meddle with the trade, nor, as he sus∣pects, to attack the men of war unpro∣voked. He thinks, they will by no means declare war, if the French do not.</P>
<P>At last, Lord Hallifax took the Duke into another room, and told him, that as he had laid before his Grace the state of his affairs, and had given him his sincere opinion, which his Grace seemed to ap∣prove of at the time, but had, he believed, never thought of since, he would trouble him no more upon that head: that he thought himself very ill used, but, if his Grace thought he could go on without any settlement, it was well—he (Hallifax)
<PB N="349" REF="361"/>
thought it impossible, and though he had hitherto been very lucky, yet the whole would certainly break about his ears. The Duke said, he still approved of what he (Hallifax) had advised, and he was of the same intention to do it, but that he could settle nothing till the King returned. Lord Hallifax replied, that was his Grace's af∣fair, and he did not care if his Grace made Mr. Pitt, Secretary; but if he made any alterations, that he (Hallifax) expected to have justice done him; he was a wretch, a nobody; he would be of the Cabinet, and have access to the King, if any thing was done. The Duke said, he was surprised to hear him talk in this manner, and went on, as if it was laying him under new diffi∣culties. To which Lord Hallifax replied, that he found it was more necessary to talk so, than he at first thought, for by his Grace's surprise, it was plain, that he never thought of it at all: that, though a lover of an active life, yet in the way he was treated, he was weary of it, and would quit it, if justice was not done him: that he found, Boscawen was coming home,
<PB N="350" REF="362"/>
and he believed the Duke of Newcastle un¦derstood that part of the squadron was t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> return with him, and a force equal to wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was in Louisbourg, to be left for a time▪ that he (Hallifax) opposed this strongly and said, if the force to be left is but equal, suppose the French should come out and beat them, is it impossible? Suppose the squadron, under La Mothe, at Quebec, should know that there was but an equal number left, might they not fall upon them, and be joined by those in Louisbourg, was that impossible? That the enemy was certainly straitned in provisions, and if a superior force remained there, the place, in all probability, must fall to us. The Duke said, the ships could not winter there, and Lord Anson was of that opinion. Lord Hallifax replied, he did not regard Lord Anson's opinion against fact; for he would maintain, that the whole navy might ride, the whole winter in Hallifax harbour, with the utmost safety: that the Albany sloop had been there, these five years, and had cost as little in repairs, as any other vessel, and is now gone out again. The reasoning
<PB N="351" REF="363"/>
seemed to be thus—If you leave those seas, the French will come out, and Louisbourg will be victualled. If you leave but a small force, it will be in danger from the ships there, and from a junction of those now in the Gulph of St. Lawrence. The French cannot remain there in November, without being frozen up. You can stay, because the harbour of Hallifax is never frozen, or very slightly; and you are at sea from thence in seven hours, and therefore never need have the same ships out above a week at a time: so, if the enemy appears, you take them— if not, you freeze them up, and their num∣bers will add to the want of provisions in the place. The Duke of Newcastle pressed him to give him these hints in writing, which Lord Hallifax declined.</P>
<P>I passed the day at Kew. The Princess<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="August"/> has had nothing of Hawke's instructions, or any thing else, communicated to her, and she expressed her dissatisfaction at it. She inveighed most bitterly against the not pushing the French every where. The people would not surely bear it, when the
<PB N="352" REF="364"/>
Parliament met. I said, I believed they would. Surely, said she, the Parliament would never bear the suffering the French to bring home their trade and sailors, &amp;c. She saw the terrible consequences of it, and of a patched up peace, which must break out, when the French had perfected their naval plan, and fall upon her son, young and inexperienced, at the beginning of his reign. I said, I doubted if any body would interfere; but if they should, I hope, Madam, you would not take it ill. I, says she, no, indeed, very far from it; I am sure, I have no reason nor any thing like it. She was very solicitous to push the war, and wished Hanover in the sea, as the cause of all our misfortunes. I said, I presumed to differ with her, that I was as ready to defend Hanover, as Hampshire, if attacked on our account. I thought it no incum∣brance if properly treated, and the only difference between me and the Ministers, was not about the thing, but the manner. She said, she perfectly understood me; and it would be so in another reign, but could not be in this; that, in the manner it had
<PB N="353" REF="365"/>
been treated, it had been the foundation of all just complaints and bad measures. I asked her, if she could account for Lord Anson and the Duke of Cumberland con∣curring in tying up Hawke's hands: the one, as a sea General, unconnected at least; the other, as a land General, at open en∣mity with the Duke of Newcastle? she said, she could not, for the Duke had strongly declared (though not to her, who had not much conversation with him) for a <HI>naval</HI> war. I replied, that might be the language of good sense only, as being the popular cry, with hopes, that a sea war might probably light up a land one. She said, I was right—and added, nobody knew what to do—no two people were together—she chose to sit still, (thinking it the only prudent part, as every body was disunited. I said, that the general diffidence she described was the cause of the infinite speculation and refinement that now prevailed: for as nobody knew, so every one was guessing each other—in which her Royal Highness had a principal part—she replied, nobody, surely, could
<PB N="354" REF="366"/>
stand clearer than she, for the world must know every body that she saw, and when. She took serious pains to convince me, that she had no fixed settlement or con∣nections at all. She may deceive me; but I am persuaded, she has no fixed, digested political plan, or regular communication in politicks, with any body, except Mr. Cresset. She then told me, that the King had sent to invite the two Princesses of Brunswick to Hanover; they came, but their mother (the King of Prussia's sister) who was not invited, came with them— we talked of the match—surely he would not marry her son, without acquainting her with it so much as by letter—I said, certainly not, as he had always behaved very politely to her. It may be so, she replied, but how can this be reconciled? In this manner, said I; nothing will be settled at Hanover; but when the King comes back, he may say in conversation and commending the Prince's figure, that he wishes to see him settled, before he dies, and that he has seen such and such young Princesses, and, though he would
<PB N="355" REF="367"/>
settle nothing, without her participation, yet he could wish to see the Prince settled before his death, and therefore, if she had no objection, he should think one of those Princesses a very suitable party.</P>
<P>She paused, and said, no: he was not that sort of man: but, if he should settle the match without acquainting her with it, she should let him know how ill she took it; and if he did it in the manner I mentioned, she should not fail to tell him fairly and plainly, that it was full early, and that she had eight other children to be provided for, that she hoped, he would think of doing for them, and not leave her eldest son eight younger children to take care of, before he had one of his own: that it was probable the Prince might have so many, that hers could not expect much provision. She was determined to behave so, whenever the King spoke to her about it. She thought the match premature: the Prince ought to mix with the world —the marriage would prevent it—he was shy and backward, the match would shut
<PB N="356" REF="368"/>
him up for ever, with two or three friends of his, and as many of hers. That he was much averse to it himself, and that she dis∣liked the alliance extremely: that the young woman was said to be handsome, and had all good qualities and abundance of wit, &amp;c. but if she took after her mo∣ther, she will never do here—the Duke of Brunswick indeed, her father, is a very worthy man—pray madam, said I, what is her mother? as I know nothing at all about her—why, said she, her mother is the most intriguing, medling, and also the most satirical, sarcastical person in the world, and will always make mischief wherever she comes. Such a character would not do with George, it would not only hurt him in his publick, but make him uneasy in his private situation; that he was not a wild, dissipated boy, but good natured and chearful, with a serious cast upon the whole—that those, about him, knew him no more, than if they had never seen him. That he was not quick, but, with those he was acquainted, appli∣cable and intelligent. His education had
<PB N="357" REF="369"/>
given her much pain; his book learning she was no judge of, though she supposed it small or useless; but she hoped he might have been instructed in the general understanding of things. That she did not know Lord Waldgrave, and as to Mr. Stone, if she was to live forty years in the house with him, she should never be bet∣ter acquainted with him than she was. She once desired him to inform the Prince about the constitution; but he declined it, to avoid giving jealousy to the Bishop of Norwich; and that she had mentioned it again, but he still declined it, as not being his province. Pray, madam, said I, what is his province? she said, she did not know, unless it was, to go before the Prince up∣stairs, to walk with him sometimes, sel∣domer to ride with him, and, now and then, to dine with him—but when they did walk together the Prince generally took that time, to think of his own affairs and to say nothing. She shewed me a letter from Hanover, that said, the news of Bos∣cawen's action, which came here on the 15th of June, got to Hanover on the 20th
<PB N="358" REF="370"/>
—that Bussy had his audience the 17th and his letters of recall the 22d, but was not gone on the 25th. She wished ex∣tremely, that he was gone, lest he should frighten them, into some unbecoming com∣pliance, as he had done, once before—I had afterwards much talk with the Prince about funding and other serious matters, who seemed to hear with attention and satisfaction</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="August"/>I was at Holland House, and had a long conversation with Mr. Fox: he said, the Hessian subsidy was ratified—that the Duke of Newcastle bade Mr. Amyand read Lord Holderness's letter to the Regency, acquainting them, that the King had made such a treaty, and caused him to observe, that his Majesty directed the Chancellor to fix the seal to it, who only bowed, and their Lordships signed it without reading it, as a thing of course. That the first directions to Lord Anson and Sir Thomas Robinson, to draw Hawke's instructions, were, that he should take and destroy all French ships of war, but no merchant∣men
<PB N="359" REF="371"/>
—when they were brought to the select persons of the Regency, they had altered them and restrained Hawke from taking any but ships of the line. The Duke of Cumberland, in this little assembly, was expressing his dislike of the alteration, when the Duke of Newcastle came in, and interrupted his Highness by saying, that he was glad of the alteration, because he knew that it was more conformable to the King's way of thinking, and then desired his Highness to proceed; who said, that he knew his Grace had correspondences at Hanover, which he did not communicate to him; but he did not know, that his Grace had taken his Majesty's pleasure, upon that head, till now, when he was pleased to declare it—that, since it was so, he had too many ties ever to say a word against his Majesty's pleasure, when he knew it. When the instructions came to the bottom of the table to be signed by him (Fox): he asked Lord Anson, if there were no objections to them, who said, yes, a hundred, but it pleases those at the upper end of the table, and will signify nothing,
<PB N="360" REF="372"/>
for the French will declare war next week, if they have not done it already. But said I, that did not happen—no, replied he, and therefore I am very sorry that I signed it. But in a few days, the Duke was very desirous to have them altered, as well as the Duke of Marlborough and myself; and in the morning before the Regency met, he endeavoured to have them extended, but without effect—when the Regency was over, the Duke of Marlborough and I desired to speak with the Duke of New∣castle, and I told him, how absurd I thought it, that we, who had begun the war, should suffer the hands, to pass by us, that were to be employed against us, &amp;c. that I desired him to remember, though I had made no objection at the Regency, yet I now did, and privately to him, declare my disapprobation to these orders. The Duke of Marlborough did the same. In the afternoon, a note came to Lord Anson, while he was at dinner at Mr. Fox's, to meet that evening at the Duke's lodgings, the result of which was to send directions to Hawke to seize or destroy every thing
<PB N="361" REF="373"/>
French, trade or men of war, between Cape Artegal and Cape Clear, and so it now stands. Mr. Fox added that, besides the Hessian, a subsidiary treaty was con∣cluded with Russia, as he understood, though he had not heard, directly, from Williams. He did not speak out about that correspondence. The subsidy was 100,000<HI>l. per annum</HI> for four years, to hold in readiness 50 or 60,000 men, for which, when we employed them, we were to pay 500,000<HI>l. per annum</HI>. He also sup∣posed, that there would be subsidies to Ba∣varia, and others. Mr. Fox continued, that he had, of late, had opportunities of conversing much with the Duke of De∣vonshire, occasioned by his son's affairs: that he was open and vehement against all subsidies whatsoever; that the nation could not carry on a naval war with France, and support Hanover, and that it must take care of itself: that we had followed the King's politicks too long, and the King must be told that the nation could not support the expence of both: that the Duke of Newcastle held by nothing but
<PB N="362" REF="374"/>
absolute submission; and he must not, nor would he contradict the King in any thing. Fox said, that Lord Granville told the Duke of Newcastle, that he would be served himself, as he and his brother had served him (Granville). They would not abase him, themselves, but would fit still and ra∣ther encourage the abuse, than defend him. He positively knew some considerable peo∣ple, not suspected of an inclination to dif∣fer, who would be absolutely against all subsidy whatsoever—he did not name them, nor would he to him (Fox). Mr. Fox said, that, talking this matter of subsidies over with the Duke, his Highness said in a word, that he was very sorry for them, that the bent of the nation was strong against subsidies for Germany, and that it would be brought to endure them with much reluctance: that his Highness laid no great weight upon the point of honour, for it would not do with the bulk of the peo∣ple: that we should see a strong exertion of power on one hand, and a strong dislike and restiveness on the other. I said, I thought Hanover might, and ought to be
<PB N="363" REF="375"/>
defended; the question was only, who was to pay for it, and in what proportions? Mr. Fox replied, he was surprised that I was not against all subsidies. I told him that those, I should be for, would hardly be the ministerial ones, but I desired to know what those Russians were to do? Why, said he, to prevent the King of Prussia from attacking Hanover in conjunction with the French. I answered, the King of Prussia would not attack Hanover. He said, he was glad to hear me say so, and hoped I could make it out. I said, there was time enough for that, and for my ideas of de∣fending Hanover. He might imagine, that I had not given myself the trouble to digest my thoughts with very great exactness, much less, to put them into writing; but that, whenever he came to act, I would lay every thing I knew before him without reserve, but it was now useless to digest and discuss what might never come into operation.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt called on me, and acquainted<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Sept."/> me that he had seen the Ministers, and that
<PB N="364" REF="376"/>
he was to see the Duke of Newcastle at his own desire, at seven this evening. He be∣gan upon the subsidies: that the Hessian he knew of for 8000 men, as a warrant for the levee money was come to his office: that he would support a naval war to the utmost, but, by no means, a continental one: the nation could not support both: it would carry us up to seven millions the first year, and would go on encreasing;— 'twas bankruptcy. Regard should be had to Hanover, no doubt, but secondarily: we should never lay down our arms without procuring satisfaction for any damage they should receive on our account; but we could not find money to defend it by sub∣sidies, and if we could, that was not the way to defend it. An open country was not to be defended against a neighbour who had 150,000 men, and an enemy that had 150,000 more to back them. In short, he urged many strong, ingenious, and solid reasons, for making a stand against them and giving no subsidies at all: that the King's honour would be pressed, &amp;c. and therefore, if the Duke of Newcastle would
<PB N="365" REF="377"/>
be contented with this Hessian subsidy for this once only, and engage, <HI>with proper se∣curity</HI>, never to offer another during the whole course of the war, and receive it as a compliment to the King for this once, ne∣ver to be renewed or attempted again, but to be looked upon as putting a final end to continental subsidies; then—though it would not be right, yet he might not ab∣solutely reject it, but might ask other gen∣tlemen's opinion about it: but for the Russian subsidy of 120,000<HI>l. per annum</HI>, and 500,000<HI>l. per annum</HI> when we took the number of men into pay, which treaty he heard was signed, if not ratified, he could never come into it upon any account— 'twas better to speak plain, there was no end of these things: it was deceiving and ruining ourselves, and leading Hanover into a snare; for if 70,000 men would not be sufficient, we must take more, till they were sufficient, which would ruin us, or we must give them up at last, when we had drawn a war upon them: that the Duke of Newcastle had made a person write to him (Pitt) to say, that the Duke was sorry
<PB N="366" REF="378"/>
that he was obliged to go into Sussex the next day, but that the Chancellor did not go to Wimple till Wednesday, and he should be obliged to Mr. Pitt, if he would call upon the Chancellor, which he did. The Chancellor told him, that he hoped, he would assist them cordially in their busi∣ness; that the King had, indeed, taken pre∣judices which were disagreeable, and that steps had been taken to remove them, be∣fore he went to Hanover: that they had been the subject of correspondence since: that they had not all the success they could wish, <HI>as yet</HI>, but they hoped they would: that the King was very fond of Lord Hol∣derness and Sir Thomas Robinson; but if any accident should happen, it might pro∣bably be brought about, in case he would assist them cordially, that they might pro∣cure the seals for him, which he so much desired. When the Chancellor had finished, Mr. Pitt replied, that he must begin with his last words—the seals which he so much desired—of whom?—he did not remember that he had ever applied to his Lordship for them: he was sure, he never had to the
<PB N="367" REF="379"/>
Duke of Newcastle; and did assure the Chancellor, that if they could prevail upon his Majesty to give them to him, under his present dislike, all the use he would make of them, would be to lay them at his Ma∣jesty's feet: that, till the King liked it, and thought it necessary to his service, and till his Ministers desired it, he never would accept the seals: that he knew, the King had lately said, that he had intruded him∣self into office: that the Chancellor knew how much he was misinformed, and if he should ask for any favour, it would be, that they should inform his Majesty better: the Chancellor had said a great deal, but he desired his Lordship to let him know, what he was expected to assist in, and what was the work? Why, replied the Chancellor, to carry on the war they were engaged in. He said, there was no doubt of his concur∣rence in carrying on the war, as it was a national war; and he thought that regard ought to be had to Hanover, if it should be attacked upon our account—The Chan∣cellor stopt him short, and said, he was ex∣tremely pleased that they agreed in their
<PB N="368" REF="380"/>
principles, and that both thought Hanover <HI>should be defended</HI>. Mr. Pitt desired his Lordship to observe the words he had used, "that regard was to be had to Hanover," and then said all he had said to me before, as to our inability to defend it, and the im∣propriety of the defence by subsidy. The Chancellor said, that he understood that the Commons, the last session, had tacitly allowed, that Hanover must be defended: that, in consequence of that acquiescence, there was a subsidiary treaty for 8000 Hes∣sians in the usual form, and also, a treaty for a body of Russians.</P>
<P>But where Mr. Pitt laid the greatest stress, was on what the Chancellor in reasoning had said; to be sure <HI>those things</HI> (meaning subsidies) <HI>should have their bounds, and that</HI>, he was afraid, <HI>they would not be very popular</HI>; and when he was enforcing the necessity of putting a total stop to them, and leaving Hanover to the system and constitution of the empire, the Chancellor seemed to ac∣quiesce in the reason, but told him, he must be sensible, that talking in that man∣ner
<PB N="369" REF="381"/>
would not make way with the King. Mr. Pitt still persisted in not giving into the subsidy, and the Chancellor desired him to see the Duke of Newcastle, and to talk it over with him. Mr. Pitt said that, if the Duke sent to desire to speak with him, he would wait on his Grace, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt thought that the Duke of De∣vonshire would oppose subsidies, and might be brought to do it in the House of Lords. He had seen the Duke of Bedford, who talked warmly and sensibly about them. He left me, fully determined to tell the Duke of Newcastle plainly, that he would not come into the Russian subsidy upon any account; nor into any thing else, till he was well apprised of the measures; till he knew who were to carry them into exe∣cution, and in what stations they were to be; and till the House was properly treated, and gentlemen were made easy, who had a right to be so. He had not seen Lord Eg∣mont, but knew he had been sent to with an offer of Sir William Young's place. He
<PB N="370" REF="382"/>
hoped, his Lordship had given no positive answer. He promised to acquaint me, with the result of the conference he was to have this evening, with the Duke of New∣castle, before he went back into the coun∣try, which he should do to-morrow.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Sept."/>Mr. Pitt returned to me, and told me, that he had painted to the Duke all the ill consequences of this system of subsidies in the strongest light, that his own imagina∣tion, heightened by my suggestions, could furnish him with. He had deprecated his Grace, not to compleat the ruin which the King had nearly brought upon himself by his journey to Hanover, which all peo∣ple should have prevented, even <HI>with their bodies</HI>.—A King abroad, at this time, with∣out one man about him, that has one En∣glish sentiment, and to bring home a whole set of subsidies!—That he was willing to promote the King's service, but if this was what he was sent for to promote, few words were best—nothing in the world should induce him to agree to these subsi∣dies. The Duke was tedious and perplexed,
<PB N="371" REF="383"/>
and would have persuaded him what a pretty figure he would make, when he was a Ca∣binet Counsellor: that the King was highly pleased with both his Secretaries, but if any accident should make a vacancy, to be sure, the King would be glad of his services, &amp;c. Mr. Pitt said, that he did not desire such vacancy, nor the office; that he had declared, when pressed about the House of Commons, that, if they expected him, or any one else, to do their business in that house, they must give him proper distinc∣tion and powers: that, in short, the Duke's system of carrying on the business of the House, he believed, would not do, and that, while he had life and breath to utter, he would oppose it: that there must be men of efficiency and authority, in the House; a Secretary and a Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer at least, who should have access to the Crown; habitual, frequent, familiar access he meant, that they might tell their own story, to do themselves and their friends justice, and not be the victims of a whisper: that he (Pitt) esteemed both the Secreta∣ries, but he supposed something was want∣ing,
<PB N="372" REF="384"/>
or why was he sent for? If they were necessary to government, no doubt they could carry on government, and he should be glad of it; for his part, if the Ministry asked nothing of him, he asked nothing of them. The Duke then said, that the <HI>system</HI> of subsidies, indeed, was not to be insisted upon, but two did not make a system: the King's honour was now engaged, and he enlarged much upon that point. Mr. Pitt replied, that he had a deep regard for the King's honour, but that the system of sub∣sidies was so fatal, that he could not think of submitting to 100,000<HI>l.</HI> unless it was given by gentlemen who became pledges to each other, and to the public; that no∣thing, of the like kind, should ever be offered again, and unless it should be noto∣riously declared and understood on both sides, that it was given and received, as a mark of the affection of a ruined nation, to save the honour of its King, who had entered into a rash engagement: but for two, it was the same as twenty, and no persuasion should make him for them. He then desired his Grace to think seriously of
<PB N="373" REF="385"/>
the consequences—What, if the Duke of Devonshire should begin the opposition in the House of Lords? If he did, he (Pitt) would not conceal it from the Duke of Newcastle; he would echo it in the House of Commons, as loudly, and with all the powers he was able to exert:—But was this all?—were there no subsidies to be re∣newed? The Duke mumbled that the Saxon an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bavarian were offered and pressed, but there was nothing done in them: that the Hessian was perfected, but the Russian was not concluded. Whether the Duke meant unsigned, or unratified, we cannot tell, but we understand it is signed. When his Grace dwelt so much upon the King's honour, Mr. Pitt asked him—what, if out of the fifteen millions the King had saved, he should give his kinsman of Hesse; 100,000<HI>l.</HI> and the Cza∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 150,000<HI>l.</HI> to be off from these bad bar∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, and not suffer the suggestions, so dan∣gerous to his own quiet and the safety of his family, to be thrown out, which would, and must be, insisted upon in a debate of this na∣ture? Where would be the harm of it? The Duke had nothing to say, but desired they
<PB N="374" REF="386"/>
might talk it over again with the Chancellor: Mr. Pitt replied, he was at their command, though nothing could alter his opinion.</P>
<P>We then, Mr. Pitt and I, talked over whom we could engage; to whom he had communicated this affair? He said, that Mr. Legge was firm as a rock. He was shy about Lord Egmont, but said he had seen him; he was received very kindly, and Lord Egmont seemed to enter into the thing; but what might happen, when of∣fers were made, he (Pitt) could not tell. He desired me to apply to Lord Hillsbo∣rough and Sir Francis Dashwood—I men∣tioned Oswald—he said, he thought that Oswald was with us (if so, it must be by Legge). I asked him, if he had commu∣nicated it to Mr. Fox? He answered, no, nor did he design to do it: he would tell me the whole of his thoughts upon that matter: that he wished Mr. Fox very well, and had nothing to complain of; but that they could not act together, because they were not on the same ground: that Mr. Fox owned to him that he (Fox) was not
<PB N="375" REF="387"/>
<HI>sui juris</HI>; he could not blame him for it, but he, who was <HI>sui juris</HI>, could not act in connection with one who was not. He (Pitt) was ready, in the last session, to pro∣ceed any lengths against the Duke of New∣castle, but when it came to the push, Mr. Fox acknowledged he could not, and went on, through the whole session, compromi∣sing every thing when it began to pinch— the Reading election; the linen affair; and when Ireland began to be a thorn, Mr. Fox's great friend. Lord Harrington, was to take it out: that by these means, Mr. Fox had taken the smooth part, and had left him to be fallen upon: Fox had risen upon his shoulders, but he did not blame him, and he only shewed me, how impos∣sible it was for two to act together, who did not stand upon the same ground. Be∣sides this, Mr. Fox lived with his greatest enemies. Lord Granville, Messrs. Stone and Murray. Mr. Fox was reported by the Duke of Newcastle, that he had lately of∣fered himself to the Duke—I here inter∣rupted Mr. Pitt, by saying, I was confident it was false: he said, he knew the Duke of
<PB N="376" REF="388"/>
Newcastle was a very great liar, and there∣fore, if Mr. Fox denied it, he should not hesitate a moment, which he should be∣lieve. I then said, that, as those, who united in this attack, were to part no more, it would be proper to think what was to be held out to them, if they succeeded: he declined this, and said, it would look too much like a faction; there was nothing country in it. If we succeeded, to be sure those, who contributed, must, and would be considered, when the first opportunity of∣fered; but to engage for specifical things and times, he thought no one man had any title, except myself: that for me, any thing, every thing that I liked, ought to be the common cause, and he was ready to enter into any engagements with me. He then expressed himself <HI>strangely</HI> as to me: that he thought me of the greatest consequence; no man in this country would be more listened to, both in and out of the House, &amp;c. &amp;c.—that he was most desirous to con∣nect and unite himself with me in the strictest manner—he ever had the highest regard for my abilities—we had always
<PB N="377" REF="389"/>
acted upon the same principles: he had the honour of being married into my relations; every thing invited him to it. He added a great deal more, that surprised me very much, considering the treatment I have met with, for years past, both from him and those relations. It surprised me so much, that all I said was, that I was much obliged to him, but that he might depend upon it, that I would not accept of his friendship, or of any mark of his confidence, without meet∣ing him more than half way.</P>
<P>Thus far, however, is fortunate, and I am glad to find, that I shall be supported in a step, which, for my own credit, as well as for the interest of my country, I must have taken, though I had met with no support at all.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax dined with me, and we<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Oct."/> settled how he was to behave to the Duke of Newcastle, on account of a letter to him from his Grace, pressing him to engage me in the King's service.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="390"/>Lord Hallifax had been with the Duke <MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Oct."/>of Newcastle, who pressed him much on my account, and begged him to obtain a meeting with me. I agreed to go to Newcastle House next Friday.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="Oct."/>I went first to Lord Hallifax, and then to Newcastle House. I was much pressed to join his Grace, but I absolutely refused being for the Russian subsidy on any ac∣count.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Oct."/>I settled preliminaries, which, with the conversation at Newcastle House, are to be found among my papers.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Nov."/>Messrs Pitt, Legge, and George Gren∣vile received letters of dismission, and James Grenville resigned the Board of Trade.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Dec."/>I went, by desire, to Newcastle House. His Grace with many assurances of confi∣dential friendship, told me, that he had the King's permission to offer me the Treasury of the Navy, which I accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="391"/>I waited upon the Princess to acquaint her with what had passed—but her Royal<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Dec."/> Highness received me very coolly.</P>
<P>I kissed the King's hand as Treasurer of<MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Dec."/> the Navy.</P>
<P>Question upon the dividing the Vice<MILESTONE N="1756."/> Treasurership of Ireland into three. It<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Jan."/> was proposed and supported by Messrs. Pitt, Potter, and their friends.</P>
<P>I was sent for to Newcastle House about<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Feb."/> the Loan, which failed from Sir John Bar∣nard's affectation of shewing his superior credit and abilities, by raising money at a price, at which it is not to be had in the quantity wanted. I subscribed 50,000<HI>l.</HI> publick money.</P>
<P>The American bill was read the third<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Feb."/> time, which was opposed, with insuffera∣ble length and obstinacy, by Mr. Pitt and his friends.</P>
<P>I waited on the Duke of Newcastle, who<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="May"/>
<PB N="380" REF="392"/>
told me with much warmth and anxiety, that they had had an account by the Spa∣nish Minister, that the French finished their debarkation upon Minorca, the 20th instant. That they had taken Mahon, and pretended to take St. Philip's, by the end of the month. And also, that, as soon as they had finished their debarkation, Mons. de la Galissionere stood out to sea, off the Island, to intercept our succours; so that, before now, there must have been a naval action between him and Byng. Galissionere has twelve ships of the line, and Byng ten very good. I said, as we were alone, that 'twas astonishing that Byng was not there a month ago. He said, he was not ready, and he was obliged to stay two or three days for his last 200 men. That we had but 63 ships of the line in Europe, and even those still wanted 4000 men. That it was <HI>impar congressus</HI>, and that Mirepoix had told him, that 30 of his master's ships would amuse 80 of ours. That, if Hawke and Boscawen did not join, we had no naval force equal to what the enemy had at Brest. I asked, why were
<PB N="381" REF="393"/>
you not ready? why have you not more ships, and more men? he replied, he had not the direction of the sea, and his Grace laid a great deal of blame there. And without naming Lord Anson, he shewed himself extremely disatisfied with him; but conjured me, upon my honour, not to mention to any body, what he had said upon that head. He concluded by insist∣ing that the island must be retaken.</P>
<P>I called upon Mr. Fox. He was full<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="May"/> of concern. He would have sent a squa∣dron, and a strong one, the first week in March, but could not prevail. Lord Anson assured him, and took it upon himself, that Byng's squadron would beat any thing the French had, or could have in the Medi∣terranean.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox came to me in the House, and<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="May"/> after saying that he must shortly call on me, to talk a little freely, as he was very uneasy at the posture of publick affairs, and, particularly, with his own situation. That the Duke of Newcastle was unusually
<PB N="382" REF="394"/>
light and trifling, yesterday, when his Grace dined with him: that he was ex∣tremely pleased with what he (Fox) had declared, on Friday last, in the House, which was, that Lord Anson authorized him to say, that the Duke had never ob∣structed the sending sooner to the Mediter∣ranean, (which was more, says he, than he could ever make Lord Anson say before) but that they were all agreed upon that point, &amp;c. That, therefore, no body blamed him; that the city imputed nothing to him, as the sea was not his province. Fox asked him, from whence he had that news—he replied, from Garraway's. Fox said, that, if he could believe any thing he heard, the city were extremely displeased with the leaving Minorca exposed, and that, generally, it would be ever true, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those who had the chief direction in a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Administration, would bear the greates<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> share of blame, and that those people de∣ceived him, who told him it was other∣wise now. The Duke still persisted tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nobody thought him to blame, and that after the declaration last Friday, the Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="383" REF="395"/>
of Commons was satisfied with him; Fox replied, he did not know from whom his Grace had his information of the House of Commons, but it appeared plainly to him, that, when Mr. Pitt charged the loss of Minorca upon his Grace, and he had de∣fended him, as answerable only in an equal degree with others, all their friends hung their heads, and not a man of them was, or seemed to be, persuaded, that a squadron could not be sooner sent, or that all had been done, which could be done. He (Fox) indeed had defended his Grace in every thing where he could defend him; but in one thing, he never could, which was, in his not believing it must be war, and in not arming sooner. The Duke still insisted, that nobody could think <HI>him</HI> to blame. Mr. Fox went on and said, that this intelligence came from Sir Thomas Robinson, who was a weak man, &amp;c. That he thought, he himself had fully an∣swered all that could be expected, or which he had engaged for, and hoped, that I thought so too: but he found by the Duke of Newcastle's whole behaviour to
<PB N="384" REF="396"/>
him, that the Duke was not at all satisfied with what he had done. Was it not true that the chief in an Administration would always be the most obnoxious? I answered, yes: unless they had any one to make a scape-goat. He seemed alarmed, and asked me, if I thought him likely to be a scape-goat and dwelt upon the expression. I told him, as the truth was, that I had not <HI>him</HI> in any degree, so much as in my con∣templation, and I had no such apprehen∣sions. Mr. Fox continued and said, he was very uneasy; that the country was in a sad way, but if it was in a better, those, who had the direction of it, could no more carry on this war, than his three children. That he himself had always hinted at sending a squadron to Minorca sooner; and that the Duke of Cumberland pressed it strongly, so long ago as last Christmas. I then asked him, whether there was any truth in the report, that the Princes George and Edward were to be kept at Kensington. He replied, he fan∣cied there were some grounds for it, but he was not, in the least, trusted or con∣sulted
<PB N="385" REF="397"/>
about it; but he knew (though not from them) that the Duke of Newcastle and the Chancellor had had two conferen∣ces upon that subject, and though private conferences between them were nothing new; for he supposed they had them every night; yet, they had had two, particularly on this subject: and he would inform me how <HI>he</HI> knew it. They were overheard in an entry, enough to learn the subject of those conversations, though not the result of them. That, when every thing was settled, he supposed Lords Holdernesse, Waldgrave, and himself should be called in, and a minute of it would then be made, and carried to the King as their joint advice. That he was ready to sign, upon any of the King's affairs, how delicate soever: but whether he should sign as his advice, what others had settled and digested, without having it any way communicated to him, was what he wanted to talk with me about, and to know my opinion. I thought this conversation much too deli∣cate to be holden upon the benches, and I,
<PB N="386" REF="398"/>
once, made him move his place, but he would go on.</P>
<P>I went to the Duke of Newcastle's; he would have talked about what had passed, the day before, in the House of Commons, upon the committee of the Million Bill, which gives the Treasury the unpreceden∣ted power of borrowing, without limi∣ting the rate of interest. Sir George Lyttleton's candour in opening it made him inform the House with this dangerous and unnecessary innovation, which produ∣ced a debate and division, where the Trea∣sury rejected the limitation offered to be inserted, by <HI>one</HI> voice only. None of us were acquainted either with the innovation, or of Sir George's design to go into the committee that day, so that the numbers were but 37 and 36. I declined talking with his grace upon the subject, telling him it was too bad. He pressed me much to go down to the Report, which I re∣ceived coolly, and I changed the subject to considering what new encouragement should be given, as a deputation of mer∣chants
<PB N="387" REF="399"/>
had been with me upon that head. He requested me to talk with Lord Anson. I then pressed him about Lord Hallifax. The Duke expressed an earnest define to preserve his Lordship's friendship, but protested, he could no more get him a blue ribband, than he could get the Kingdom of Ireland for me. I said, I conceived <HI>that</HI> was the mistake. That though I wished Lord Hallifax had the Garter, yet I never mentioned it, or meant it: what I meant, was the Cabinet; Lord Hallifax from station, services, and merit, had a right to it: his Grace's own interest loud∣ly called for it, and could not <HI>he</HI> do that? he strongly declared, he would think of it, and do all he could, as soon as the session was concluded: but he had talked with Lord Hallifax's friends, and understood that the Cabinet would not satisfy him. I replied, make his Lordship to blame then: shew you have done for him, what every one knows you can and ought to do; and if, at last, you are to break; break at least upon a point where you have some ground to depend upon, and not where you have none,
<PB N="388" REF="400"/>
in declining to do what you can do, be∣cause you do not attempt what, possibly, there may be some doubt about. He was very uneasy, and protested, with great ear∣nestness, that he would do all in his power to oblige Lord Hallifax, as soon as the Parliament rose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="May"/>War declared with France.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="June"/>I heard that a message in writing had been sent to the Prince, from the King, offering him an allowance of 40,000<HI>l. per annum</HI>, and an apartment in the palaces of Kensington and St. James's. The answer was full of high gratitude for the allowance, but declining the apartment, on account of the mortification it would be to his mo∣ther; though it is well known that he does not live with her, either in town or country. The Spanish Ambassador had an account of an engagement, between Byng and the French, in the Mediterranean—Byng had thirteen ships of the line and five frigates; the enemy had twelve, and four frigates: it lasted four hours, when, by the advantage
<PB N="389" REF="401"/>
of the wind, the English stood out of gunshot, and were out of sight the next<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Jun."/> day.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox shewed me Byng's strange let∣ter<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Jun."/> of the action, and yet stranger council of war.</P>
<P>I had a note from Mr. Fox that things<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."/> went ill, and I dined with him on the 14th, when he appeared to be in an extraordinary perturbation.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was sent for to town, and came.<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Oct."/> He returned, rejecting all terms, till the Duke of Newcastle was removed.</P>
<P>The King sent for Fox, and told him,<MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Oct."/> that the Duke of Newcastle would resign, and bade him think of an Administration.</P>
<P>Fox met Mr. Pitt at the Prince's levèe, who declined giving him a meeting, or treating with him (Fox) at all.</P>
<P>The Duke of Devonshire was sent into<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="Oct."/>
<PB N="390" REF="402"/>
the country to Mr. Pitt, who gave a posi∣tive exclusion to Mr. Fox.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Nov."/>I saw Lord Hillsborough, who fancies the Court will not submit to Mr. Pitt. —I think otherwise.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Nov."/>Lord Hallifax told me, Mr. Pitt's demand. are agreed to, and he will act with them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Nov."/>The Duke of Devonshire, after having agreed to accept the Treasury, with Fox as Chancellor of the Exchequer, went to settle it with the King, and came out, from the presence, with Legge for his Chancellor.— This is incredible, but true.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Nov."/>The Duke of Newcastle resigned.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12." UNIT="Nov."/>Mr. Fox resigned; and the Duke of Devonshire kissed hands for the Treasury.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Nov."/>The Duke of Devonshire called at my house, and left word he would come again to-morrow. I sent to let him know, I would wait on his Grace, and I accord∣ingly
<PB N="391" REF="403"/>
went to Devonshire House. The Duke told me, that he was forced by the King to take the employment he held: that his Grace was ordered to go to Mr. Pitt, and know upon what conditions he would serve: that, in the arrangement Pitt and his friends made, my office was demanded — he was very sorry for it—he was not concerned in it—and he behaved very civilly, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A motion for 200,000<HI>l.</HI> for an army of<MILESTONE N="1757."/> observation in Germany agreed to, without<MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="Feb."/> debate or division. Mr. Tucker had agreed with Mr. George Grenville to be Paymaster of the Marines, and for Governor Grenville to be chosen in his place. The King sent to Fox to know if he could prevent it, and if he thought I would interpose: Mr. Fox said, he supposed, if his Majesty com∣manded me, I would. The King ordered Fox to speak to me—he did, and I stopt it. This is the first step towards turning out Lord Temple.</P>
<P>The Duke of Newcaste, who had re∣signed,<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Mar."/>
<PB N="392" REF="404"/>
would not move: the King grew impatient to get rid of the Ministry, <HI>which he had imposed upon himself</HI>, and threw himself upon Fox to form a new Admi∣nistration. We agreed to begin with dis∣missing Lord Temple; I proposed Lord Hallifax for the Admiralty, the King con∣sented to it, and I was to negociate the af∣fair with him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Mar."/>Mr. Fox and I had a long conversation about this settlement. We agreed that, (as the Duke of Newcastle, to whom the first place, and the nomination to the others, was several times offered and pressed even by the King himself, had refused to act <HI>as yet,)</HI> an Administration should be formed, where a first place should be ready to receive the Duke of Newcastle: but none of the old Ministry should be employed at first, till the enquiry was over, &amp;c. The Duke of Devonshire to be at the head of the Treasury, Lord George Sackville to be Secretary. I declined being Chancellor of the Exchequer, but if Lord Hallifax ac∣cepted the Admiralty, I agreed to accept of
<PB N="393" REF="405"/>
the Board of Trade. The King still eager for the change.</P>
<P>N. B. During this while, Lord Hallifax, (upon whose friendship and concurrence I depended from repeated assurances, and to whom I had communicated all this tran∣saction, and, till now, without authority) privately saw and negociated with the Duke of Newcastle, and took measures with him to defeat it. What makes this the more surprising is, that always before, at that very time, and ever since, he has spoken of the Duke of Newcastle to me and others, as a knave and a fool, in the strongest terms.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox called upon Messrs. Pitt and<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Mar."/> Legge, and made them disown the prevail∣ing lye, spread by their friends, of troops being to go from hence, with the Duke, to Germany: they, each of them, respec∣tively, disowned any knowledge, or belief of any such proposition. In less than three months afterwards, Mr. Pitt gave above a million of English money, and sent what was called 10,000 (somewhat more than
<PB N="394" REF="406"/>
7000) English soldiers, to that very army, when it was commanded by <HI>another Prince</HI>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Mar."/>The Ministers, after all their threats, not pushing the enquiry, Fox moved for it, to be entered upon, by a committee of the whole House, on the 19th of April, which was evidently throwing it into contempt.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Mar."/>Fox came to me, to see Lord Hallifax, and he told him, that Sir Thomas Robin∣son had accepted the seals by the King's command; that Lord Mansfield approved of the system, and said, in the strongest terms, that the Duke of Newcastle ought to do so too. Lord Hallifax acquiesced upon that condition; but he understood, I suppose, by his private dealings with the Duke of Newcastle, that Robinson was not to accept—Lord Hallifax writes to Robinson, who answers him, that he has had some talk about the matter; but not having re∣ceived any account how it would end, can∣not give his Lordship the information he desires, but at the same time expresses a wish to see him. Lord Hallifax imme∣diately
<PB N="395" REF="407"/>
waits on Sir Thomas, and returns and reports, that Robinson, with a most submissive preamble, had sent an absolute refusal (but not disapproving the plan) and added, that he could not, must not, would not accept.—So all is at a stand.</P>
<P>I went to Lord Hallifax, who had writ∣ten<MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Mar."/> to Fox, that he would accept, if Ro∣binson took the seals—<HI>which he knew, at the same time, Robinson would not take</HI>.</P>
<P>A message was sent from the King, to<MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Mar."/> the Duke of Newcastle, to offer him to come in again: if not, to say, if he would support the present plan; if not support it, to name what plan he would support, but to speak positively, for his Majesty would not admit of any more evasive answers. We, however, think he will have one, and therefore conclude it most adviseable to force Robinson to be Secretary.</P>
<P>Lord Winchelsea kissed hands for the<MILESTONE N="5." UNIT="Apr."/> Admiralty.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="408"/>Mr. Pitt dismissed. Mr. Fox and I were <MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Apr."/>ordered from the King, by Lord Holder∣nesse, to come and kiss his hand as Pay∣master of the Army, and Treasurer of the Navy. We wrote to the Duke of Cum∣berland our respectful thanks and accep∣tance of the offices; but we thought it would be more for his Majesty's service, not to enter upon them publickly, till the enquiry was over; which the King ap∣proved of.</P>
<P>N. B. The Duke of Newcastle, prepared, and all along informed by Lord Hallifax (who acted shamefully in the affair) joins Pitt; takes the Treasury; makes Pitt Se∣cretary again; Lord Temple, Privy Seal; Lord Anson, the head of the Admiralty; &amp;c. &amp;c. and his Grace tells Lord Hallifax, that it is settled, he (Hallifax) should be the third Secretary for the Plantations; which was his Lordship's object, and for which he had overturned our whole plan. Lord Hallifax tells all his friends of it; he goes to Court and talks to Pitt about it, as a hing settled: Pitt stared at him, and told
<PB N="397" REF="409"/>
his Lordship very coolly, and very truly, that he never had heard one word of it, and he did not conceive, that any body had a right to curtail his office to that degree, which was, already, too much encroached upon by the Board. Lord Hallifax, covered with confusion, goes away in a rage, writes an angry letter to the Duke of Newcastle, complains to the King, but meeting no great comfort, he resigns—but asks one or two things for his friends, and is refused. The Duke of Newcastle, as Lord Hallifax says, behaved with the utmost meanness; he owned he had not spoke to Pitt about it, and that his reason was, <HI>Pitt looked so much out of humour, that he durst not</HI>. Lord Hallifax talked of his Grace every where in the most opprobrious terms, as the ob∣ject of his contempt and detestation—<HI>but</HI> as his Grace had not filled up the office, his Lordship, about Michaelmas, conde∣scended to take it up again, just as he left it.</P>
<P>The King kept his word with Fox, and
<PB N="398" REF="410"/>
made him Paymaster—but his Majesty was not pleased to behave so to me.</P>
<P>Thus ended this attempt to deliver the King from hands he did not like, and it failed from Lord Hallifax's duplicity, which drew a greater affront upon him, than I ever remember offered to any body; from the Duke of Newcastle's treachery and in∣gratitude, who, after having given his word to the King, that he would never join Mr. Pitt, but by his Majesty's consent, forced the King to consent; and by his Majesty's timidity, who dared not to support any body, even in his own cause.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Sept."/>The secret expedition was founded on the information of one Clarke, a Lieutenant in the Train, who told the Ministry that he passed through the place some years ago, and was shewn the works, as an English officer, by order of the Governor: that the ditch was dry; the fortifications, garrison, &amp;c. such as might be taken by storm. This was believed, and then, without the farther
<PB N="399" REF="411"/>
examination of any one person but a French pilot, Thierry, General Mordaunt was sent out.</P>
<P>It sails.<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Sept."/></P>
<P>It arrives near Rochefort.<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Sept."/></P>
<P>It takes Aix. Mordaunt proposed land∣ing<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Sept."/> at, and taking Fort Fouras. Thierry offered to bring a ship within four hundred yards of the fort, and to lay her in soft mud at the ebb (which afterwards appeared he could not do). Hawke refused a ship.</P>
<P>Spent in sounding for another landing,<MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Sept."/> and one was found four miles farther.</P>
<P>Council of war. Question if the ditch was<MILESTONE N="25." UNIT="Sept."/> dry? The pilot of the Neptune, who had lived several years at Rochefort, affirmed he knew it to be wet.—The French pilot con∣firmed it—Clarke persisted it was dry— Was asked, in case it was wet, could the place be taken by escalade—answered, no. The council was then unanimous, that the
<PB N="400" REF="412"/>
attempt upon the place was impracticable. The difficulties of landing at the new dis∣covered spot were very great—the trans∣ports could not come within a mile and a half of the shore—the ships of war not within a league—there was a row of sand banks upon the shore, sufficient to conceal a number of men—the pilot, who had lived there, said, that he had known a western gale blow off shore, for seven weeks toge∣ther, so stiff that no boat could land upon the coast.</P>
<P>However, Mordaunt, though refused the protection of one ship, but terrified, perhaps, with the fate of Byng, resolved to land wherever he could, to try to take Fouras and look at Rochefort.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Sept."/>Spent in looking after better landings, but finding none, Mordaunt embarks his troops the 28th, at night, but the wind made it unadviseable to land. The next day, Hawke declared that if Mordaunt would take upon himself the consequences of keeping the great ships out, at that season
<PB N="401" REF="413"/>
of the year, he would stay; otherwise, he must go home. Mordaunt would not do that, so they returned together. And thus ended this expedition, contrived with so much secrecy, that every thing, necessary to its success, was a secret to the contriver himself.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, a year afterwards, when Mordaunt (who certainly should have had living witnesses of the futility of the plan) had been brought to a trial, and, also, worried by all the low Court flatter∣ers and scriblers, it happened that Capt. Dennis took the Raisonable, commanded by the Chevalier de Rohan. Mr. Fox told me, that being with Lords Waldegrave and Gower together, they both told him, that Dennis had assured each of them se∣parately, that his prisoner, the Chevalier de Rohan, had told him, that he (the Chevalier) was at that time in Rochfort, or la Rochelle, (the Lords in comparing notes had no other doubt in their narrative) and that our enemy had 7 or 8000 men there at least. That there were 3,500 men
<PB N="402" REF="414"/>
behind the sand-banks, and there was a masked battery at each end. That, if we had landed when we first appeared, we should have embarrassed them. But they thought themselves betrayed, when they found we did not land at the time we at∣tempted it.</P>
<P>Late in the Autumn this year, the army, that was supposed to remain in a state of inactivity by treaty, took the field again under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, the Duke of Cumberland and his treaty being disowned by the King.</P>
<P>In the month of June or July, Sir George Lee told me (which was confirmed after∣wards by Lord Hallifax) that he had been more than once sollicited to be Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Duke of Newcastle, in the Administration he was then negoci∣ating. That Sir George consented not without difficulty. That the Friday before Whitsunday he was at Newcastle House, and the Duke told him, that all was settled in general with the King, and that he was
<PB N="403" REF="415"/>
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Duke shewed him, what he said was, the list in detail, which he was going to carry to the King at Kensington, and desired to see Sir George the next morning. Upon Sir George's telling him, that he was to go next morning to his brother in Bucks, the Duke pressed him to stay. His Grace was asked, if he did not go to the House of Lords from Kensington—yes—Sir George met him there, and the Duke told him all was settled, and that the King a∣greed in form to his being Chancellor of the Exchequer; upon which they parted, Sir George being to return on Monday or Tuesday. When he came back to Town, he found the system entirely altered, and another Chancellor of the Exchequer (Legge) made part of it. And Sir George further told me, that he never had had any communication from, or with the Duke of Newcastle, either by word of mouth, note, message, or common friend, since his parting from him at the House of Lords, till Sunday the 16th July, the day but one preceding our conversation, when the
<PB N="404" REF="416"/>
Duke came and sate down by him at Lei∣cester House, and, with all the ease and familiarity of an old friend, communicated his no news to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin informed me, that Holborne was very willing to agree with Lord Lou∣don, in not attacking Louisbourg. And that Anson, since he last came in, had told the Ministry, that Holborne went out with no better stomach for fighting than Byng. That, at a meeting of the Lords, Newcastle, Hardwick, Holdernesse, Anson, and Mr. Pitt, it was proposed to send the armament, then preparing against Rochefort, to the assistance of his Royal Highness in Ger∣many, on account of the Duke's ill success upon the Continent: that every man was for it, except Mr. Pitt, who insisted, if that resolution was to prevail, that minutes of the meeting should be taken, and his dissent entered. Upon which the others desisted; but no one would acquaint the King with the result, and Mr. Pitt was left to do it himself. He further told me, that the King had said, his revenues were
<PB N="405" REF="417"/>
seized, that he was 800,000<HI>l.</HI> in debt, and that the Army must disband, if it was not supplied from hence: and that Pitt had consented to give him 100,000<HI>l.</HI> and 20,000<HI>l.</HI> to subsist his daughter.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax told me the following history of his friend Legge. Instigated, as I suppose, by his Lordship and Oswald, (who hoped to enhance their favour with the Duke of Newcastle, while the negoci∣ation with Mr. Pitt was open, by their bringing over so considerable a person) and following the low, shuffling disposition of his own heart, Mr. Legge met a little be∣fore Easter, the Duke of Newcastle, at Lord Dupplin's, coming in at the back door through the park, at nine o'clock. That meeting passed in assurances of good-will to each other, and went no farther. That the Duke proposed another, which Legge was afraid to hazard, but the correspon∣dence was kept up by message. This treaty was for Legge to come in, without Mr. Pitt, if the latter persisted in his exor∣bitant demands.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="418"/>The Duke of Newcastle chiefly treated with Mr. Pitt by the Primate of Ireland, Stone. One day, in the beginning of the negociation, when Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt were in conference with the Primate, and insisted upon very extravagant terms, the Primate beg'd them as a friend, to be a little more moderate, and, before they went so far, to consider whether they were sure of <HI>all</HI> their friends. They were surprised, and said, they thought so. He replied, that he thought otherwise, and could, if he would, <HI>(for he was authorised to do it)</HI> tell them a very different story. Mr. Pitt immediately insisted upon knowing it, or he would treat no farther. Upon which, the Primate told them this private transac∣tion of Legge with the Duke of Newcastle. This discovery occasioned great coolness to Legge at Leicester House, which, as soon as he perceived, gave him much un∣easiness. At last (I think from Lord Hallifax) Legge found out, that, in return for his thinking of leaving his friends for the Duke of Newcastle, the Duke had be∣trayed him to them. He would have ex∣postulated
<PB N="407" REF="419"/>
with his friends, but they would not suffer it, and, the negociation taking place in their favour, they bade him take the exchequer seals under the Duke of Newcastle, and enter into no further ec∣claircissement. He has done so, detected by Mr. Pitt and Leicester House; acting under one, whom he hates; who hates him, and has betrayed him; breaking faith with Lord Hallifax, without whom he engaged himself not to act; and with Oswald, to whom he had pledged his honour, never to come into the Treasury without him. And all this for quarter day!</P>
<P>After the battle of Hastenbeck, and the<MILESTONE N="1758."/> disowning the Duke and the convention of Closten Seven, by the King, late in the Autumn of the last year, the Hanove∣rian army again took the field, and was commanded by Prince Ferdinand of Bruns∣wick.</P>
<P>A message by Mr. Pitt for a supply to<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Jan."/> keep the Hanoverian army together—and 100,000<HI>l.</HI> was granted.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="420"/>Commodore Howe sailed from St. He∣lens <MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="June"/>with one seventy gun, three fifty gun ships, several frigates, one hundred trans∣ports having on board sixteen battalions, nine troops of light horse, and all prepa∣rations for a siege, commanded by the Duke of Marlborough, Lord George Sack∣ville, General Waldegrave, &amp;c. Lord An∣son sailed the same day.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="June"/>They arrived in the Bay of Concalle, near St. Malo, and burned a few ships of no great consequence and several small craft which were on ground: they were all fired by the light horse. After staying about six days without attempting St. Malo, and on being informed there was a body of about 10,000 men assembled, or assembling in the neighbourhood, they re∣imbarked, with the loss of two or three men on a side. They continued in, or near the Bay of Concalle, till the men be∣gan to grow sick, ragged and lousy, from want of room in the transports, and were reduced to a quart of stinking water a day.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="421"/>Our expedition returned. When it was<MILESTONE N="1." UNIT="July"/> known that they were come back, it occa∣sioned great disputes among the Ministers, whether they should land or not, which lasted till the 5th instant; when, at a meet∣ing of the Cabinet, it was determined that the men should land (as there was great sickness among them) while provisions, &amp;c. were preparing for them. These orders were sent on the 6th. At this meeting, there was great difference of opinion. Lord Granville declared, he was always for distressing France upon the Continent; experience had taught him to have no great expectations from expeditions; he meant no reflections upon the late ones, nor to make his court, for he wanted nothing; his duty alone made him speak, &amp;c. Mr. Pitt said, he had sufficiently shewn, that he was for supporting the Continent, by paying an army of 50,000 men for its de∣fence. That he had consented to send 10,000 more from hence. But still he thought that expeditions, and keeping France in alarms upon the coast, was the most effectual way to distress her; —That
<PB N="410" REF="422"/>
expeditions had always succeeded. Did you not take Port l'Orient, if St. Clair would have accepted it? Did you not take Rochefort last year? it was entirely at your disposition. Have you not taken St. Malo? &amp;c. &amp;c. Lord Ligonier said; my Lord Granville, your Lordship must admit. Lord Granville interrupted him with, my Lord, I will admit nothing; your Lord∣ship is apt to admit, but I will admit nothing.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10." UNIT="Jul."/>The 10,000 men, which were allowed by Mr. Pitt for Germany, were to be commanded by the Duke of Marlborough, Lord George Sackville and General Walde∣grave, all having deserted the expedition. Lord George said, he would no longer go Buccancering: the King refused to let him go to Germany, but his Majesty was obli∣ged to submit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="Jul."/>The expedition again put to sea, with a less force than before: three of the re∣giments, and half the light horse, having been sent to Germany.</P>

The magistrates did not obey his orders, and his Grace was in too much haste to return, to put his threats in execution.</P>
<P>An account came that Cherbourg sur∣rendered<MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Aug."/> the 8th instant.—the troops, be∣ing two regiments, withdrew. There were about twenty seven ships in the Har∣bour—thirty pieces of brass cannon taken.</P>
<P>After having demolished the bason and<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Aug."/> the forts, our troops left Cherbourg, the 16th, without any molestation, though it

is said there was a great body of troops in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Sept."/>Our troops landed the 4th instant in Lunaire Bay and burned twenty vessels. They were to march to St. Guildo, the 9th, and to reimbark, the 10th, at St. Cas near Matignon.

<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Oct."/>I was told by a gentleman, who had it from Colonel Cary, that upon landing at St. Lunaire, Colonel Clerke told him that his plan was 1st, that Lord Howe should bombard the forts of St. Malo, while they of the land were to take the town by escalade. That being impracti∣cable — 2dly, that they should go to St. Bride, were they were to find and burn 300 ships, and where they found only as many fishing boats as might be worth about 50<HI>l.</HI> 3dly, they were to march far∣ther into the country, to intimidate the French, who had nothing but a few mi∣litia

<P>Lord Hallifax called on me, and told<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="May"/> me, that the Duke of Newcastle was ex∣tremely
<PB N="414" REF="426"/>
glad of having a vacancy in the Treasury, by making Lord Besborough Postmaster, and now he might take Mr. Oswald, and all would be settled; but that Lord Bute came to him, in the name of all of them on that side of the Adminis∣tration, and told his Grace positively that they would not consent to Oswald's being in the Treasury; and the rather, as they knew he was not his Grace's man, but was suggested to him by Mr. Legge: and this, the Duke, very much frightened, was pleased to own. He added, that they thought they had as good a right to re∣commend as any one, and they expected that Mr. Elliot of the Admiralty should succeed: the Duke did not absolutely ac∣quiesce in the nomination, but he did in the exclusion.</P>

<P>Mr. Ellis was with me to let me know,<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Nov."/> that the Duke of Newcastle was desirous of seeing me about the election at Wey∣mouth. I deferred giving an immediate answer.</P>
<P>I wrote to Lord Bute, desiring him to<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="Nov."/> settle the answer, I should send to the Duke of Newcastle.</P>
<P>Mr. Ellis came for the answer, which<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Nov."/> was, that I beg'd to be excused troubling his Grace, because my interest at Wey∣mouth was engaged to gentlemen, who, I could not doubt, but would be agreeable

to him, because I had reason to believe they would be acceptable to the King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Nov."/>Lord Bute sent to desire to see me at my own house, in Pall Mall.

<P><MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="Nov."/>Lord Bute came to me by appointment, and staid a great while. I pressed him much to take the Secretary's office, and provide otherwise for Lord Holdernesse— he hesitated for some time, and then said, if that was the only difficulty, it could be easily removed, for Lord Holdernesse was ready, at his desire, to quarrel with his fellow Ministers (on account of the slights and ill usage, which he daily ex∣perienced) and go to the King, and throw up in seeming anger, and then he (Bute) might come in, without seeming to displace any body.—I own the expedient did not please me.</P>

the King sent and offered his Grace the Bedchamber—which is not true.</P>
<P>The whole affair, as I had it from Lord Bute, was this—The Duke, after having talked very offensively of the Scotch, on the promotion of Sir Henry Ereskine, asked, in a private audience of the King, to be of his Bedchamber: his Majesty gave him a civil, but not a decisive answer, and acquainted Lord Bute with it, who told his Majesty, that the Duke's quality and his age made him a very proper servant to be about his person, upon which Lord Bute was ordered to let the Duke know that the King accepted his service, which Lord Bute performed, and then mentioned to the Duke, how his Grace's behaviour about Sir Henry Ereskine was particularly offensive to him (Bute). The King was displeased that he was not informed of it before, and Lord Bute said, that he thought the Duke a proper servant for his Majesty, and as such, recommended him, but not as his friend. The Duke came to see Lord Bute, to thank him for his kind offices, and
<PB N="419" REF="431"/>
to disown all political connections with Mr. Fox. Lord Bute said, that the King had no manner of objection to Mr. Fox, and that he himself had a great regard for him personally: and then Lord Bute fairly told the Duke, that the King knew how he had talked about Sir Henry Ereskine's affair, and of him (Bute) in particular; which the Duke endeavoured to palliate, and said, it had been much aggravated.</P>
<P>Lord Bute called on me, and we had<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="Dec."/> much talk about setting up a paper—and about the Houses, in case of resignations.</P>
<P>Mr. Glover was with me, and was full<MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Dec."/> of admiration of Lord Bute: he applauded his conduct and the King's; saying, that they would beat every thing; but a little time must be allowed for the madness of popularity to cool. He was not determi∣ned about political connections, but, I believe, he will come to us.</P>
<P>Lord Bute was with me, and we weighed<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Dec."/> and considered all things, and, though af∣ter
<PB N="420" REF="432"/>
long discussions we parted without any decision, I think he inclines much to my scheme.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27." UNIT="Dec."/>I had a long conversation with Lord Bute about Lord Egmont, whose election I undertook to secure, if the King com∣manded me, on his being refused the Peer∣age. His Lordship's answers to my que∣ries of the 25th instant. We talked about the city militia, and the demand of the Lieutenancy for the whole corporation— about the Dukes of Newcastle and Argyle flattering Lord Bute with the King, and their offering to act under him. The Duke of Chandois's pretensions—the Duke of York's establishment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lord Egmont's affair is as follows. I yesterday received a letter, letting me know that Lord Egmont had lately written to his steward, Biddlecombe, with orders to shew the letter to the Mayor of Bridgewa∣ter, wherein he lets him know, that it was probable, there would be an election at Bridge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither on the 23d or 24th.
<PB N="421" REF="433"/>
In which case, he should propose Lord Percival in his room. All this appeared to me so strange, that I asked Lord Bute about it. He, after putting me in mind that he had told me, a week ago, that there never was a thought of making Lord Eg∣mont a Peer, or that even any application had been made, said, that very lately Lord Egmont had been with him, and beg'd earnestly to go into the House of Lords— that his election at Bridgewater was very uncertain—that he was very ill, and much dejected, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That he (Bute) told him there was very little encouragement, and told me that the King was very little disposed: he asked me, what I would do in his election, to which I replied, throw him out. Lord Bute seemed to think it hard he should be in neither house. Perceiving that, I said that, if the King would keep him out of the House of Lords, and he (Bute) desired it, I would secure his election at Bridgewa∣ter. He said, it was too much for me to give up family interest. I replied, nothing
<PB N="422" REF="434"/>
is too much that is useful, where friendship is real and mutual.—And here it now stands.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1761."/>Lord Bute came and said, he was sure <MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Jan."/>that the Ministry had some glimpse of get∣ting off our system, by setting up that of abandoning Hanover, and of applying the money to distress France into a peace; that they would, by their popularity, force this measure upon the King, who must conse∣quently lose a great deal of his own. I told him, as the truth was, that this measure was the only sound one to get out of the war. That I had yesterday begun to put my thoughts upon it into writing, to per∣suade him to obtain powers of the King to carry it into execution. That my only doubt was, whether the new Parliament should not be suffered to meet, only to de∣clare in the speech that his Majesty found himself involved in this war, to which he had no ways contributed: that, seeing the bent of the nation so violent, he had ac∣quiesced in it, without approving of it, persuaded that they would soon feel, if
<PB N="423" REF="435"/>
they did not see, their error: that he was convinced that the present method of de∣fending Hanover would ruin this country, without defending that; and he therefore would no longer expose his regal domini∣ons to such hardships, for fruitless at∣tempts to protect his electoral; but would leave them in the hands of his enemies, and apply the expence to force them to a reasonable peace, by means more probable and proper to attain that end.</P>
<P>He paused a considerable time, and did not say positively, that he could, or could not, get the King to consent to this system, but he returned to say, that he thought the Ministry had an eye that way. If such should be their scheme, I said, it would be irresistible; but there was one way to defeat the use they proposed from it, which was, to put himself at the head of it, in a great office of business, and to take the lead, and the merit of bringing with him the true British principles of making war, peace, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="436"/>Lord Bute said, that, tho' he was sure the Ministry looked that way, he hoped and believed they would not easily follow it: that I, indeed, always talked of them, as if they were united, whereas they neither were nor could be. That the Duke of Newcastle most sincerely wished for peace, and would go any lengths to attain it. That Mr. Pitt meditated a retreat, and would stay in no longer than the war.</P>
<P>But, for my part, I think they will con∣tinue the war as long as they can; and keep in, when it is over, as long as they can; and that will be, as long as they please, if they are suffered to make peace, which will soon be so necessary to all orders and conditions of men, that all will be glad of it, be it what it will, especially if it comes from those, who have all the offices and the powers of office. All which can never end well for the King and Lord Bute. His Lordship now shewed me a letter to Lord Egmont, which he wrote in the King's presence, saying, "that the King is resol∣ved to make no more Peers, at present,
<PB N="425" REF="437"/>
than those now before him; that if his Lordship thinks his personal application to his Majesty will make him alter this resolution, he hoped his Lordship would take that step: and then added, if you think your election uncertain, and I can be of any service to you in it <HI>(as I think I can)</HI> your Lordship may command me." I hope he will not accept the service offered.</P>
<P>His Lordship then said, he was persua∣ded it would be seen this very winter, if the Ministry endeavoured to prolong the war; for he thought, that the King of Prussia himself would insist upon their making a peace, and even a separate peace.</P>
<P>This I confess, I do not understand— we agreed upon getting runners, and to settle what we should disperse.</P>
<P>I dined at Sir Francis Dashwood's.<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Jan."/> Lord Bute came, and he shewed me Lord Egmont's answer: he is displeased, but de∣sires to know, if he is to understand his Majesty refuses him the Peerage for ever,
<PB N="426" REF="438"/>
or for this time only. We are now quit of his Lordship. Lord Bute thinks the French will make a separate peace upon the present foot—I think not—and I en∣deavoured to shew him, that nothing but ruin could flow from our persisting in the present measures; nothing could produce peace, but withdrawing from the Conti∣nent; that it must be, either from neces∣sity, or from being driven into it by those, who brought this ruin upon us, or from a petition to the throne by the united voice of his Majesty's best subjects. But, at all events, it ought to appear, that the giving up Hanover was his Majesty's own system; and therefore in case any thing, that looked that way, should be moved, he (Bute) should be prepared to take the lead, and that he and I should begin the affair in the House of Lords. I wish I may have con∣vinced him. I had written, and afterwards I mentioned Lord Talbot's son in law to succeed Boscawen who was dying. He was sorry, I had not thought of it sooner, but he had agreed to fill his place by a re∣moval out of the board of trade. I tried to
<PB N="427" REF="439"/>
get the Jewel Office for him by an arrange∣ment for Lord Lyttleton—but in vain. We wished to have some coffee-house spies, but I do not know how to contrive it.</P>
<P>Lord Bute came, and said, that he was<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Jan."/> now sure that Pitt had no thoughts of aban∣doning the Continent, and that he was madder than ever. He was uneasy with Talbot, as he would have put the Steward's staff into Talbot's hands the first day if he could. That he had heard that Talbot thought Granby could persuade his father to quit it, and that, otherwise, he would not accept it, on account of the friendship between him and Granby. That Talbot would make an excellent officer to reform that most corrupt office. That, in what∣ever he (Bute) should do for his friends, he should always, at the same time, consi∣der the service of his master and of the public. I pressed him much for Lord Talbot, to which he replied, that he had marks of all the distinctions that were going. The Council accepted, and refused
<PB N="428" REF="440"/>
in the promotions of Peerage, an Earldom. That he perceived, Lord Talbot meant a place of more consequence than he (Bute) wished. He was sorry for it—for he was violent, and I might depend upon it, he would be impracticable in business. That Lord Talbot had used him unkindly. I said all I could, and from my heart. I touched again upon Rice—he said, he thought the board of trade no improper beginning, and that, possibly, might be shaped out. I said, the offer of any thing directly from him, accepted or not accepted, I thought would be very kindly taken. That Henley owed his being made Chancellor, from Keeper, entirely to him, and that he had brought Henley's letter to shew me. I beg'd his Lordship to pre∣serve that letter, as well as some others, he had shewn me, properly labelled and tied up: for the ingratitude of mankind might make it of use to have preserved them. He smiled, and said he had already sound it so: and then told me Martin's impertinent conversation at the Admiralty, in presence of a dozen people, about a line
<PB N="429" REF="441"/>
to be drawn between the Scotch and the English, and that it ought to be observed and continued.</P>
<P>Lord Bute then said, that he must see the Duke of Newcastle, to settle with him, about the elections, shortly. That, to those, who had proposed to him to unite with the Duke upon conditions, he had said; he would agree to no conditions till he saw Talbot, Dashwood and Charles Townshend, (which last, he said, had sworn allegiance to him, <HI>for a time)</HI> had such places as he wished.</P>
<P>As to the army, he wished he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alk with an impartial officer: that he thought the King of Prussia and Prince Ferdinand were as popular as ever. I an∣swered, that I thought the King of Prussia began to be very little so: and that there was something so servile in the education of an officer, that, if the officer found out what he desired to hear, he might be sure of hearing nothing else. That I thought Prince Ferdinand was become as unpopular
<PB N="430" REF="442"/>
in the army, as he was once popular—that he was accused of three great heads of malversation. The first was, that he had exacted complete pay for uncomplete corps: the second, that not one shilling of all those devastating contributions had been carried to the publick account: the third, that he had received good money, and had paid the troops in bad, to a very great amount, and at a great discount: that this last was an affair mercantile and of exchange—and that, if the charge was true, I would undertake to find those, who should lay it open to the world beyond contradiction. Lord Bute's notions about the war are very singular, and, I believe, not throughly digested: he thinks, the ene∣my will make a peace upon the present foot∣ing, if we go on conquering their islands, &amp;c. I think, that they will never make peace with us, till we withdraw our troops actually, or till they think we design it. His opinion is, that withdrawing our troops would either effect a peace, or ena∣ble us to carry on a war much cheaper, and by national means for national ends;
<PB N="431" REF="443"/>
but what compensation is to be made for Hanover? I replied according to the da∣mage done, and the foundation must be, how much heavier the taxation of the electorate has been, than what it was un∣der its natural Prince. He said, that, if we made this separate peace, we must still pay the King of Prussia, which would make the war look more unnational. I thought not, but then, he said, we must stop here, and not think of conquering any farther. I answered, I saw nothing to conquer, that France had as much lost Martinico, as she could lose it—that the French government had not received a sixpence from the duties, nor the subjects from their estates, these two years. He said, all the produce came home in neutral ships. He then returned to the difficul∣ties of indemnifying Hanover, if the troops should be withdrawn and the peace be made. And this makes me doubt, whether the King can be brought to aban∣don Hanover, which seems to me to be the only method to secure a good peace to that country, as well as to this.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="444"/>The Keeper was yesterday made Chan∣cellor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Feb."/>Lord Bute came and was dissatisfied with the clamour about the beer, at the play-house, the evening in which the King was there. I mentioned to him the intelligence which I had just received; that Mr. Pitt had told Mr. Beckford, last Friday, that all was over, and he would have no more to do. He replied, he did not believe it. He had not seen Mr. Pitt this fortnight, but had seen Mr. Beckford lately, who dropping in conversation that he wished to see the King his own Minister, he (Lord Bute) replied, that his great friend Mr. Pitt did not desire to see the King his own Minister, and he might tell him so, if he pleased, for that it was very indifferent to him (Bute) if every word he said was carried to Mr. Pitt. I asked his Lordship, if he knew why the Parliament was kept on so long? he said, he thought it was the better for him, as his friends had the more time to look about them, and that the Duke of Newcastle was desirous
<PB N="433" REF="445"/>
to have it end. I then asked if he had settled the new Parliament with the Duke? he replied, he had not seen his Grace for some days, but supposed he should soon, and he would then bring his list with him. That what were absolutely the King's boroughs, the King would name to; but where the Crown had only an in∣fluence, as by the customs, excise, &amp;c. he could not be refused the disposition of it, while he stayed in. That he had told Anson, that room must be made for Lord Parker, who replied, that all was engaged: and that he (Bute) said, what, my Lord, the King's Admiralty boroughs full, and the King not acquainted with it! that Anson seemed quite disconcerted, and knew not what to say. His Lordship was not for pushing them yet, for if the peace was a bad one, as it must be, they would cer∣tainly proclaim, that it was owing to their dismission, because they were not suffered to bring the great work to a happy con∣clusion, to whom the glorious successes, which had hitherto attended their conduct∣ing it, were entirely to be attributed. In
<PB N="434" REF="446"/>
short, he seemed to think, that nobody could stand such a peace, as must be made upon the present system, but those who had brought us into that system and were the authors of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Feb."/>His Lordship and I talked over Charles Townshend being Secretary at War, and Sir Francis Dashwood's succeeding him. He seemed resolved to come into Adminis∣tration, but not yet. We agreed that, if there was nothing irregular to be done, the new Parliament would be the King's, let who will chuse it: he said, it was very easy to make the Duke of Newcastle resign, and he did not imagine, that his Grace would do it in any hostile way, or make those, whom he elected, oppose the Minis∣try. But, who was to take it? was the question. He did not seem to think it adviseable, to begin there. I replied, I saw no objection; but if he thought there was, he might put it into hands that would resign it to him, when he thought proper to take it; but that he must begin to be a publick man, by taking something, or else,
<PB N="435" REF="447"/>
the objection would be the same at ten years end. He said, that Holdernesse knew nothing of what the Minister was doing for these last ten days, and therefore he began to think with me, that it was pos∣sible Pitt might resign.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>HERE the Diary concludes; but it is much to be re∣gretted, that his Lordship did not continue it, during the very interesting period, which immediately preceded his de∣cease. The confidential letters in my possession, and his Lord∣ship's answers to them (both of which he most carefully pre∣served) might assist me in carrying on the history of those times, till within a month of his death: but, as I have nei∣ther leisure for such an undertaking, nor sufficient knowledge of that memorable aera, to enable me to select or digest the letters properly, I think it prudent to decline so arduous a task; a task, indeed, that would have been attended with almost insuperable difficulties: for we may naturally suppose that, in a written intercourse between his Lordship and men of various principles, many of the letters and answers would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvey representations, very contradictory to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of others.</P>
<P>Lord Melcombe was too experienced a courtier, to speak the same language to all people: on the contrary, he was stu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious to assimilate his politicks to those of his correspondents, and to make his ideas apparently consonant to the opinions of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se men, from whom he expected em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>

<HEAD><DATE>FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1736-7.</DATE> A NARRATIVE OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN The PRINCE and Mr. DODINGTON; AND AFTERWARDS BETWEEN Sir ROBERT WALPOLE and Mr. DODINGTON: UPON The resolution of his Royal Highness to bring a demand into Parliament, for an augmentation of his allowance to 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> and for a jointure upon the Princess.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday, the 7th of February, 1736-7, being informed that the Prince went to bed indisposed, I thought it my duty to go to his lodgings next morn∣ing (Thursday the 8th) to enquire of the Pages of the Back Stairs, after his health. I found his saddle horses in the Court; they told me he was pretty well, and insisted upon letting his Royal Highness know I was there. I would not admit of it, being obliged, that morning, to attend the Treasury, and the House; but, before my coach could drive off, one of the Pages, overtook me with a message from the Prince to at∣tend him.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="450"/>I found him with the servants in waiting about him, his boots on, and powdering his hair, to ride out. After having finished his dress, he directed the gentlemen to withdraw; and then, with his usual goodness, was pleased to talk to me very freely, upon the state of his Majesty's indisposition, and upon several other subjects, relating to transactions, and persons, of a publick nature.</P>
<P>After half an hour spent in this kind of conversa∣tion, I humbly offered to take my leave, but he com∣manded me to sit down again, and then said that he would communicate a secret to me of great importance, in which he should desire my assistance, and designed partly to employ me. I answered, that if his Royal Highness was pleased to trust me with a secret, I had one favour to ask, which was that he would tell it to nobody else, and then I would be answerable it should remain a secret. He told me that it was not of that nature; that it would be known; that several people now knew it; but that no one servant of the Crown, as he believed, was acquainted with it: that having always had more kindness, and affection for me, than for any body, he thought he owed it me, (as he was pleased to express himself) to communicate it to me, the first of any of the King's servants, and by his own mouth: that those who were chiefly concerned, and engaged in it, were apprised of this his resolution, and not only approved, but even advised, that I should be the first of the Court made acquainted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="451"/>Exceedingly surprised as I was at this unexpected prelude, I only returned thanks, in the best manner I was able, for the gracious and condescending expres∣sions he was pleased to use, and really did not guess (as I naturally might have done, if I had not been sur∣prised) what it tended to. He then entered into very bitter complaints of the usage he had, all along, met with from the Administration, and even from their Majesties: that he was not allowed wherewithall to live, &amp;c. that he was resolved to endure it no longer, and had determined to make a demand in Parliament of a jointure for the Princess, and of 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> for himself, which his father had, when Prince, and which he looked on to be his right, both in law and equity. I objected to the very great danger of such an undertaking; put his Royal Highness in mind, how strongly I had always been against it, when he for∣merly mentioned it; and was going to shew the fatal consequences it must produce, besides the great impro∣bability of success. But he interrupted me, and said, that it was too far gone for those considerations; that he did not ask my advice, but my assistance; he was determined upon the measure, and designed to send and speak with my particular friends, namely, Sir Paul Methuen, Lord Wilmington, and the Duke of Dorset; but chose out of kindness to me, to acquaint me, first with it: that he would send to Sir Paul by Sir Thomas Frankland, and asked me, if I would break the matter to them, and what, I believed, they would think of it. Sensible of the danger and diffi∣culties that attend negociations of this delicate na∣ture,
<PB N="442" REF="452"/>
even among the best friends, I replied, as to the first part, that I humbly beg'd to be excused from breaking it; that whatever friendship those gentlemen did me the honour to admit me to, I thought it a matter too high to undertake: that, as he had men∣tioned his intentions of sending to them, and as they were, by their rank, and affection to his Royal High∣ness, every way qualified to be consulted, I thought it highly proper that he should know their sentiments from their own mouths, in an affair of this very great importance; that then, what they said to his Royal Highness, could not be mistaken, and what he was pleased to say to them, could not be misrepresented. As to what they would think of it, I was confident, by what I felt myself, that they would be infinitely surprised; too much so, in my judgment, to give his Royal Highness any positive and determinate opinion. He said, he did not want their opinion, but their as∣sistance, and what would my friend the Duke of Argyll do? Be extremely surprised too, without all doubt, Sir, I replied; I do not know what he will do, but I am confident, I know what he would not do, which is, he would not advise your Royal Highness to this measure. He answered, that the measure was fixed, that he was resolved, and wanted no advice, but he would not send to him, nor to Lord Scarborough, but to the Duke of Dorset, and Lord Wilmington he would send, being resolved it should come into the House of Lords the same day, or soon after, let the fate of it be what it would in the House of Com∣mons. He stopped here a little, and used some ex∣pressions,
<PB N="443" REF="453"/>
as if he would have me understand, that he had said enough about all those that he thought I lived with, in the closest connection. I endeavoured, after assuring him with what affectionate duty we had always been his sincere servants, to shew the great improba∣bility of success in such an undertaking; but he cut me short, and said, None at all, that there were prece∣dents for it; and mentioned that of the Princess of Denmark, in King William's time: that all the op∣position, and the Tories were engaged in it: that as it was his own determination, and he had been advised by nobody, when he had resolved it in his own mind, he thought it necessary to speak to people himself; he had done so, to Mr. Pultency, Lord Carteret, Lord Chesterfield, Master of the Rolls (Jekyll,) and Sir William Wyndham; that they were all hearty in it; that Mr. Pulteney, at the first notice, expressed him∣self so handsomely, that he should never forget it: but said he could, at that time, only answer for him∣self, not expecting the proposition, but beg'd leave to consult with some of his friends; which his Royal Highness granted him, and he had, since, assured him that they were unanimous: that Sir William Wynd∣ham had said, that he had long desired an opportunity of shewing his regard, and attachment to his Royal Highness; that he would answer for his whole party, as well as for himself; and that he was very happy, that an occasion presented itself to convince his Royal Highness, by their zealous and hearty appearance in support of his interest, how far they were from being Jacobites, and how much they were misrepresented
<PB N="444" REF="454"/>
under that name. [N. B. He spoke in the debate, but did not vote, and forty-five Tories were absent.] That Lord Winchelsea was gone down to Petworth, to bring up the Duke of Somerset, who he thought would move it in the House of Lords: that Mr. Sandys, Sir Thomas Saunderson, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Waller, Sir John Barnard, and several others were acquainted with it, and highly approved it: that, possibly, Sir John Barnard might move it. He then asked me, if I had really heard nothing of it from the Court. I assured him, with great truth, that I had not; from whence he was pleased to infer, how generally odious the Minister must be, that nobody would tell him a thing that so nearly concerned him, when by his Royal Highness's calculation of those that knew it, and asked leave to consult their friends, there could not be less than from forty-six to fifty that must be acquainted with it: he added, that it would make an end of his power, or to that effect, which I had no reason to be sorry for. I told him that, indeed, I had no reason, nor did I pretend to be partial to the Minister, but it was my misfortune to differ so far with his Royal Highness, that I thought this measure would be the most effectual one to secure and strengthen him. He seemed much surprised at that, and asked my reason. I said I thought so, because the Minister had, I believed, long since experienced, that he could have no hopes of governing by the approbation, and affection, of the people: that his only security, therefore, was his fa∣vour, and hold at Court: and in my poor opinion, this unhappy measure would make the King's cause, and
<PB N="445" REF="455"/>
his, inseparable, and rivet him yet faster, where his only strength lay. I then humbly beg'd him to consi∣der the circumstance of time; how far it might be consistent with the known greatness and generosity of his character, to make such an attack, when his father was in a languishing condition. He replied, that he was sensible of that, but he could not help it: he was engaged, and would go through: the King could not live many years, but might linger thus a good while, and he could not stay that while: that the time, indeed, had its in∣conveniencies of one sort, and he wished it otherwise, but it had its conveniencies of another; it would make people more cautious, and apprehensive of offending him: that, besides, he had told the Queen of it in the summer, and assured her that he designed to bring it into Parliament; that she had treated it as idle, and chimerical; that it was impossible that he should make any thing of it, and seemed to think he was only in jest: that if his friends stood by him, he should carry it in the House, but if he missed there, he could not fail of it, in six months: that I should know the family as well as any body; he always thought I did; but found that I did not, or would not; but he him∣self knew his own family best, and he would make a bet that, if he failed, now, he gained his point in less than a twelvemonth, by this means: in short, he was resolved, and too far engaged in honour to go back: that it was his due, and his right; absolutely necessary to make him easy the rest of his life: he could never want his friends but on this occasion: those that would stand by him in this, he should always look on as his
<PB N="446" REF="456"/>
friends, and reward as such; those that would not, he should not reckon to be so, they would have no∣thing to expect from him; and several other expressions to that purpose: that it was to be brought in, soon; in what shape, whether by address, or otherwise, he believed was not yet settled, but soon it must be. I made no particular answer to this last part, but only expressed my concern for the consequences, and wait∣ing on him down stairs to his horse, beg'd of him to consider, how necessary it was to delay it from the great impropriety of the time. He said, if a little time would do, it might be considered, but the King might linger out the session in the same way. I took the liberty to ask what would be the ill consequence if that should happen, and it should go over to another session. He said that could not be, his honour was too far engaged, he could not, he would not stay.</P>
<P>Here this conversation ended, without any direct de∣mand to vote for this proposal, on his side; and with∣out any direct promise, or refusal, on mine: and I left his Royal Highness with very great uneasiness, and perplexity upon my mind, considerably augmented by the great ease and tranquility that appeared upon his; which is the natural effect of great resolutions, when they are fixed and determined.</P>
<P>Upon reflection on what had passed, finding it was resolved to apply, personally to the Duke of Dorset, Lord Wilmington, and Sir Paul Methuen, I thought it a duty of the friendship in which we had, so many
<PB N="447" REF="457"/>
years, lived, to prepare them for so disagreeable a con∣ference: and first, as he was to be called on, the next day but one, I acquainted Sir Paul Methuen with it. We joined in lamenting the fate of this country, to be divided and torn to pieces by a disunion in this Royal family, which, with so many ardent wishes, with the profusion of so much blood, and treasure, we had, at last, so happily placed on the throne, to end all our divi∣sions, and protect us in union and tranquility. We agreed that Sir Paul Methuen should not seem to be any ways apprised of the cause of sending for him, but should lay hold on all overtures that should be given him, to represent strongly to his Royal Highness the very fatal consequences of this undertaking; and by no means give him any the least reason, or encourage∣ment to think, that he would vote for it.</P>
<P>I then opened the matter to the Lords. We had several conferences upon it; and agreed to communi∣cate it to Lord Scarborough, by the Duke of Dorset. The Lords unanimously agreed to do their utmost to prevent this ill-advised attempt (if they were sent to,) and not to be hindered by any interruptions, from repre∣senting strongly to his Royal Highness, the fatal con∣sequences of it. But in case he persisted in it, to declare plainly to him, that they should think themselves obliged in conscience, and in honour to oppose it, as fatal to his Royal Highness, injurious to the King, and destructive to the quiet and tranquility of the whole country; and desired me to do so too, in case it should be my lot to be first called upon.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="458"/>Sir P. Methuen was not sent for on Thursday, which gave me some hopes (vain ones indeed) that the great coldness I had received the proposition with, might have had some weight. On Friday the 11th, I received a message from the Prince, at Mr. Stanhope's, where I dined, to attend him next morning to Kew. I was not sorry for the opportunity, being resolved to leave no ambiguity in his Royal Highness's mind about my behaviour, and very apprehensive that names going about, and misrepresented as doubtful upon so important a point, (how insignificant so ever) might influence, or mislead unwary people. Before we rose from table, at Mr. Stanhope's, a servant brought me word that Sir P. Methuen had been at my house, and left word that he was gone home. I went directly to wait on him. He was then just come from the Prince, to whom he had represented the danger and impracticability of this measure, with all the force and weight that became so honest and so honourable a man; and used all possible arguments, that a good head and a good heart could suggest, to dissuade him from it; but all without ef∣fect: that he then declared to him, that he could not be for him; but, at the importunate and repeated re∣quest of his Royal Highness, and reflecting that he had not attended the House, so as to give one single vote, since the excise bill, he had been prevailed on to pro∣mise his Royal Highness to be absent, as he used to be.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 12th, early in the morning, I re∣ceived a message <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the Prince, that he had put off his journey to K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w that day. However, being willing
<PB N="449" REF="459"/>
to come to an explanation, it was thought proper that I should place myself in the way, and go to his Royal Highness's apartment, to enquire after his, and her Royal Highness's health. The Pages told me that he was not come from the Princess's bed-chamber, but was pretty well, and had altered his resolution of going to Kew. I went away on foot, and did not return home all the morning. Just before three, one of the Prince's servants found me in the Park; told me he had been at my house, but the servants knowing nothing of me, he had been all over the town after me, to let me know there was a mistake in the morning message, and that the Prince ordered me to dine with him, that day, at his house in Pall Mall.</P>
<P>I dress'd, and got thither before his Royal Highness, but not before the company, which consisted chiefly of his bed-chamber. When he came, he desired the gen∣tlemen to amuse themselves, and that he would take a walk with me till dinner. In the garden, after a little common conversation, he began by telling me that he had seen Sir Paul Methuen, and insinuated that Sir P. seemed well enough satisfied with the proposi∣tion. I said I was infinitely surprised, and mortified that I should differ with him in opinion, in an affair of such consequence, considering the long friendship between us, which implied some similitude of thinking. Upon which, he receded a little from that, and seemed to give me leave to think that Sir P. did not much ap∣prove of it, but however, had promised to be absent. Then he said he had talked to several people, and
<PB N="450" REF="460"/>
they, all, entered into it most heartily. Having taken my own party, I did not think proper to enquire who they were, though I was very curious to know: being persuaded, (and I am so still) that there could not be one unprejudiced man in the nation of competent age, weight, and experience, to advise a Prince, that would approve of such a measure. After some pause, he told me he had spoken to Mr. Hedges (his Treasurer) and Lord Baltimore (of his bed-chamber) who were zea∣lously for it. I said, no doubt his servants would vote for it; nobody could take it ill of them; they would have leave to do it. He answered, that 'twas no mat∣ter whose leave they had, so he had their votes. He added, that he had spoken to Mr. Arthur Herbert, who not only engaged for himself, but would bring in all his friends. I smiled, and said, I did not apprehend that he could make any vote but his own. [His bro∣ther was in France.] He said he would bet Mr. Her∣bert could make above five. I replied, that, if it were so, it must be by making use of his Royal Highness's name. He said, that every body was for him: he was absolutely determined to bring it in: he would hear no advice upon it, and if there were but seven in the House of Commons, and three in the House of Lords for him, he would do it. I told him that, since he was abso∣lutely determined, I thought it necessary to lay my humble opinion before him, when he would please to receive it. He said, he did not want my opinion, his party was taken. I replied, that I did not presume to offer my opinion as what was to guide his actions, but to lay before him what was to direct and govern my own; which I
<PB N="451" REF="461"/>
should be glad to take the first opportunity of doing, this not being a proper one, because I saw one of the gentlemen coming to acquaint his Royal Highness that dinner was served. He took no notice of that, but walked into the wood, and said that he would shew me the Duke of Somerset's letter; which he did. It con∣tained a pretty long account of the precarious state of his Grace's health, which made it impossible for him to come to town: referr'd to Lord Winchelsea for his opinion of the communication he had received of his Royal Highness's intentions; and concluded by wishes that his Royal Highness may live many years, in health, prosperity, and plenty: he made me take notice of the word plenty. I said that, with humble submission, this letter did not seem to me to amount to a promise, nor give the least prospect of his Grace's coming to town. He said it was no matter, he should have his proxy, which was the same thing, [as indeed he had.] He then, with a great deal of vehemence, fell upon the difficulties he lay under: that as he had sacrificed him∣self to the nation, by demanding a marriage, (though the Princess was the best, and most agreeable woman in the world) the nation ought to stand by him: that if people would value their employments more than right and justice, he could not help it; though he was so strong that he was sure the Court durst not touch any one that voted for him. I got an opportunity of put∣ting in a word here, and said, that I saw, very well, little regard would be had to any professions of not be∣ing blassed by one's employment, though I thought my behaviour towards those in power plainly shewed
<PB N="452" REF="462"/>
(and to nobody more plainly than to himself) that I was not very solicitous about mine: but I did, in my conscience, think (and believe that every honest man, whose circumstances were above necessity, would think) this matter to be far above any pecuniary considera∣tions: that a breach, so irreparable as this proceeding must occasion, would, for the future, take off all the grace and lustre of any employment of either side: that no man of honour above necessity, could serve, for the future, with pleasure, under the uneasy apprehensions that duty on the one side might be misconstrued into disaffection on the other: and therefore I humbly be∣sought him to believe that gentlemen, in this great case, would lay aside those lesser considerations, and act upon superior and more affecting motives, their duty to the whole, which I thought evidently in danger. He re∣plied, that it was to no purpose to talk about things settled, and resolved amongst friends: that it was very hard he should be all his life in want, and the only one in the nation that was not to have justice done him: that, now, was the time, and the only one, for people to do what they owed him; that he should expect it of them; he asked his right, and neither apprehended, nor foresaw, any ill consequences from it. I asked him, if he did not think it very dangerous to him to drive things to such an extremity between him, and his father, as might make it the interest of one half of the gentlemen of England, that he should never come upon the throne. He replied, why would they make them∣selves desperate? Why would they not do what they owed him, and what was justice? It would be their
<PB N="453" REF="463"/>
own faults: did he deserve less than the Princess of Denmark? The gentlemen stood by her. I endeavoured to shew him the difference of the case, in one essential point, which I thought most likely to strike him, viz. In that case the addition was proposed when the civil list was precarious, and not granted to King William for his life; and upon re-granting the duties which were, then, in the power of Parliament, that addition was demanded in her favour. But he gave no attention to it, but walked about with great precipitation, and a good deal agitated. As I saw there was no room left to make any impression upon him, I thought it was high time to put an end to the conversation, and there∣fore told him that since I found him unalterable in his resolution, I would not presume to offer any thing more in opposition to it, but must beg leave to give him my plain sentiments as to myself: that I would have been glad to have had liberty to consult my friends, because it would have given my opinion more weight with my∣self, but as that could not be, and as I believed no∣thing they could say would alter it, I thought myself obliged to declare to him, and I did it with great con∣cern, that if this matter came into Parliament, I should think myself obliged, in honour and conscience, to give my absolute dissent to it, as pernicious and destructive to all the Royal Family, and to the nation in general. He seemed very angry, but curb'd himself a little; and said he could never have expected this from me; but he supposed then, that he was to expect all my friends against him, [meaning those gentlemen of the House of Commons whom he thought I could
<PB N="454" REF="464"/>
influence.] I told him that I spoke only for myself; that I had not dropped the least hint to any one of them; they would know it but too soon. This con∣versation brought us to the door; I saw he was very much heated, and, going in, he said he must do as he could; that in the Princess of Denmark's time there were gentlemen that valued doing right, more than their employments; he was sorry the race of them was extinct: I had only time to say, that I was to submit to whatever his Royal-Highness pleased to think, or say, and content myself with doing what I thought my duty. Thus we went to dinner, with a great deal of anxiety on my part, from the real affection, as well as reverence, that I bear him; and with much more freedom, and gaiety on his, than I could possibly put on.</P>
<P>As soon as dinner and drinking was over, we rose, and I shuffled myself into the midst of the company, in order to get away with the first of them, when he pleased to make us his bow; but he dismiss'd them all, and ordered me to come with him into the little room. This conversation was much the longest, lasting near two hours; but as there was a great deal of repe∣tition, I shall only put down what has not been al∣ready said; though scarce any thing was said by him, in the two former, that was not strongly repeated, and insisted upon, in this.</P>
<P>His Royal Highness began by telling me that he had done with asking me any thing more for his sake,
<PB N="455" REF="465"/>
but, as he had always had the greatest kindness and af∣fection for me, he would now talk to me a little, for my own.—That he desired me seriously to consider, in this affair, my own reputation in the world; that it would suffer extremely by leaving him: that I must be sensi∣ble, I had done myself a great deal of hurt in the opinion of mankind, already, by acquiescing so much as I had done, in measures, with those who had treated me, and all my friends so ill; but that it would be a great ag∣gravation to that prejudice, if I neglected so advanta∣geous an opportunity as this of getting free from it: and much more to this purpose. After humble thanks for his goodness, I replied that I was very sensible of the difficulties I lay under: that I had no choice to make but what must be disagreeable, and painful to me: that as to the Ministry, I had very little regard to those who treated me, or any of my friends slightingly: that I thought nobody cared less who knew it, or took less pains to conceal it: that in an affair, where I was convinced the whole was concerned, I must prefer my own integrity to the opinion of the world, and keep peace at home, whatever other people might think, or say. He said it was strange, that his best friends, and those he counted most upon, should be against him: that he wondered I should consider my own character, and my interest so little: he had always had the greatest kindness for me, he was resolved to shew it in the most distinguishing manner; why would I make it impossible? Why, when he should have it in his power, give occasion to have it thrown in his teeth, that he was going to distinguish one who had left him at the
<PB N="456" REF="466"/>
only time that he could want his friendship? That I must be sensible, after this, he could see me, no more, upon the foot he had done. I said, I was extremely sensible of the truth of all he had been pleased to say, and that I had no comfort on either side, but from the sense of doing my duty: that my reason informed me this was a measure fatal to himself, and to the whole country; I was convinced of it; and my honour and conscience obliged me to dissent from it. He asked me, supposing that were so, if I never had given a vote against my opinion, in concurrence with those I had no reason to like. I answered, I had, many; and believed it was the case of every body who had acted with a party, either for, or against an Administration: that, in my opi∣nion, business was not to be carried on in an abstracted way, by considering every point simply, and without connection to the whole: but that I had never acted contrary to my opinion, where I thought the whole immediately concerned, as I stood convinced it was, in this; and therefore, no earthly consideration could make me be for it. He then press'd me much with the authority of the people engaged: Would I talk with Mr. Pulteney and Lord Carteret? and if I was con∣vinced it was their opinion, and they thought it right, would I then be for it? It could do no hurt to see them at least. I replied, I could have no doubt that they were engaged in it, after what his Royal Highness had been pleased to say; and that Lord Carteret might be the more easily induced to it from a persuasion that it must drop in the House of Commons. He said, that if there were but three votes for it, there, it should
<PB N="457" REF="467"/>
come into the House of Lords: did I think him so simple as not to know Carteret? Would I see them? I answered that I had the greatest regard for Lord Car∣teret's parts and abilities, and the most sincere respect and value for Mr. Pulteney, with whom I had lived in an intimate acquaintance for some years, and whom I always reckoned one of the most considerable men this country had bred: that if his Royal High∣ness commanded me, I was very willing to wait on them, but in no ways upon the foot of altering my opi∣nion, singly upon their authority, and because the con∣trary might be theirs: but, (I overshot myself so far as to add) to shew his Royal Highness how much I was in conscience persuaded of the truth of my opinion, unequal as I was, (and in nobody's thoughts more so, than in my own) I would venture to talk with both those gentlemen, before his Royal Highness, upon the consequences of this measure, and if they could shew me that the bringing it into Parliament would not be attended with the greatest dangers, prejudice, and di∣visions, both in the Royal Family and the nation, be it right, or wrong in itself, when brought in, then I would be for it. His Royal Highness dropp'd this proposition (which I was extremely glad of, having given a very indiscreet opening against myself) and said it was his due; he hoped it was no fault to claim his due, and the Master of the Rolls told him that it was his right in equity. I said that equity amongst gentle∣men, indeed, was understood to mean a plausible de∣mand to a thing; but as the Master was a Judge in Equity, I was surprised at the expression from him,
<PB N="458" REF="468"/>
and could hardly believe that he would affirm to me, that there could be grounded a legal equity upon that statute; to take the allotment of the estate thereby vested in the Crown, out of the King's disposition. He said it was his right, he had one hundred and eighty en∣gaged to support him, and he hoped he should ob∣tain it.</P>
<P>Not seeing the end of the conversation, I was re∣solved, if possible, to do what I thought my duty, and to set before him the precipices he was going to plunge into, let the reception it met with be what it would; and accordingly, I took the liberty of saying, that since it was absolutely necessary he should have 50,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> addition, I humbly beg'd leave to know of his Royal Highness, why he would not rather chuse to ask it of the Parliament, than to push this dangerous and desperate measure? That I was highly sensible this proposition was very far from being prudent, or adviseable in itself, but, bad as it was, yet it was so infinitely preferable to the other evil, that I would not only be for it, but would support and maintain it with all my strength; and would engage that all my friends, not only those of the House of Commons, but those of the House of Lords, would be for it. He said, no, he thought the nation had done enough, if not too much for the family, already: that he would rather beg his bread from door to door, than be a farther charge to them; and that he would have it in this way, or not at all. I replied, that since he expressed so much tenderness to the nation, I intreated him to
<PB N="459" REF="469"/>
consider the state to which he reduced it: to reflect on the profusion of blood, and treasure we had lavished, to maintain our liberties and constitution: to remem∣ber at what a vast expence we had brought over, and maintained his family, solely, and singly, to secure to us, and protect us in the quiet enjoyment of those liberties, and that constitution; and then to think what sentiments it must raise in every honest country gentleman of great property; who have warm wishes to all the Royal Family, and who expected no∣thing but a good word, and a kind look from every part of it in return; to think a little, I said, what that body of men must feel, to be dragg'd, un∣avoidably, by that very Royal Family, into the fatal necessity of being desperate with the possessor of, or the successor to the Crown: that, for my part, I should not be surprised, if they all absented themselves from the House, with hearts full of discontent, and distaste on both sides. He said, that if they would not do their duty chearfully, they must be frightened into it; or to that effect; he could not suffer all his life, &amp;c. I asked him, if he thought they were to be frightened; and if they were, I appealed to his generosity, if that were a just return: that I most earnestly supplicated him not to overturn the constitution, and the whole Royal Family together: that I had always been bred in monarchical principles, such as were consistent with a free people: that I could no more help the people to intermeddle with the just rights of the Crown, than tamely sit still, and see the Crown invade, and destroy
<PB N="460" REF="470"/>
the just rights of the people. Did he, could he believe, that if the King were to propose to a council, for their opinion, whether he should give his Royal High∣ness 50,000<HI>l.</HI> or 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> that any of those Lords he had named, or myself, should have a mo∣ment's difficulty, in delivering, and supporting our opinion for the larger sum? Surely he could not; there we should act according to our duty, and consti∣tutionally; but to bring the Parliament into the King's closet, for them to examine into his most pri∣vate, domestick affairs, intrude themselves into the government of his private estate and family, was, surely, the most fatal precedent that could be made, and the most unheard of to be attempted by a Prince that was to succeed him: that I most earnestly conjured him to consider what he was doing: that we all hoped he would have children; that he knew he had a brother; if it should happen when he was on the throne, that discontents should arise, (and there had been discon∣tents under the best Princes that ever reigned) how would he like to have a Parliament tell him, that the Duke was an amiable, and a popular Prince, of great merit and expectation, that they thought his appanage too small, and desired his Majesty to double it: that he was born in England, and the nation could not think themselves safe in keeping up such an army, unless the Duke was declared General? Would he like this? and yet this they might do, they would have a precedent for it, and what was more extraordinary, and unan∣swerable, a precedent of his own making. He said he knew how to avoid that: he gave me his word he
<PB N="461" REF="471"/>
would make his children and his brother entirely easy, they should have most ample allowances; that would be a most effectual way to keep every body quiet. I asked him if he was sure that they would be, all, and always reasonable? Would all those that advised them, be so? Could he be blind to what fatal foundations he was laying for future disturbances? And beg'd him to consider, that even rebellions with a Prince of the Blood at the head of them, lost a great deal of the horror, and even of the danger of common rebellions. I desired, that he would talk to the Duke of Argyll, and Lord Scarborough, to see if I was single in my apprehensions. He said, no, the Duke of Argyll was too deeply engaged with the Court, by his employments. I intreated him to look on the Duke in a far superior and more just light, as one of the first of his father's subjects, and more so, by his firm, and unalterable at∣tachment, and unavoidable connection to the whole Royal Family, than by his rank; but, however, Lord Scarborough had no employment. He still said no; Scarborough, he knew, was always full of his fears, which he laughed at. I replied, that I was sure, if Lord Scarborough had his fears, they were for his Royal Highness, and not for himself. He still refused to speak to either of them, and said that, now he did not think to speak to the Duke of Dorset or Lord Wil∣mington. I beg'd him to believe, that I only spoke my own sentiments, and not to alter his design of sending for them upon that. He said, no, it was to no purpose; he knew we were in the same way of thinking, and was satisfied, he could expect nothing from thence,
<PB N="462" REF="472"/>
so would not send for them; nor would he, now, for Sir Thomas Frankland, or Sir Conyers Darcy, as he once designed. I still persisted to desire, that he would not include those gentlemen with me, who knew no∣thing of it; but he persisted in the contrary, which made me say that I was extremely sorry that he would not speak to gentlemen of that character; and that I did not believe he would find one dispassionate man, unheated by opposition, of figure enough to be consulted, who would not, most ardently, and vehemently advise his Royal Highness against this measure. He then re∣newed his instances strongly to make me for it, and said he should make a very bad figure in the world, when it appeared that his best friends were against him, (and this he repeated often) in the only point he could want them, and in a point I well knew he was, always, entirely set upon, and had always had in view. I replied, it was true, I did know he was always bent upon it, but his Royal Highness as well knew, that I always, as constantly opposed this way of attempting it: that he well knew that my firmness on this head, was the first, and chief cause of his withdrawing, for these two years last past, the confidence he formerly honoured me with: that I spoke it, without the least thought of complaint, but he knew it was so; and therefore, as I could, by no means, charge his Royal Highness with acting inconsistently in pursuing this view; he must also do me the justice to own, that I acted consistently with myself in dissenting from it: that as he had been graciously pleased often to use the word friends leaving one, friends not assisting one, &amp;c. I most humbly
<PB N="463" REF="473"/>
beg'd leave to submit, if it was friendly to take a reso∣lution of the highest nature, a resolution one was known to be against, and unalterably to fix that resolu∣tion, with I could not say who; not with the friends, certainly, of those he was graciously pleased to call friends; and all this, without the least communication to them, till it was irrecoverable; without giving them the least opportunity of having their objections weighed, or their scruples removed; but only to tell them that the thing was fixed, and they must follow, or refuse it. He then set forth how unpopular the Court had made itself through the nation, which was much the reverse, on his side. I told him, that I reflected, with much concern, on any unpopularity, but was thoroughly persuaded that this measure would lessen the unpopularity where he seemed to express the greatest dislike; and lay a foundation for it, where he thought, and I was persuaded there was none; be∣cause I was convinced that an attack upon his Royal Father, of this nature, and at this time, would produce so incurable a division, that when mens' first passions subsided, and they began to reflect coolly, the authors, and advisers of this measure, (I did not know them, but the world would certainly fix it somewhere, un∣justly perhaps) would, in the end, become the detesta∣tion of mankind, and perhaps of posterity. He still continued to press m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> warmly, and said that my being against him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off his fingers; but sure I could not deny him to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if I would not be for him. I told him, that as I now stood informed, it was im∣possible for me to be absent; when I had taken a ma∣ture
<PB N="464" REF="474"/>
resolution upon a thing of this weight, I thought it would be inconsistent with my honour, and reputa∣tion, not to dare to shew it: that, however, if I could find any means to satisfy my honour to myself in being absent, I would wait on his Royal Highness again, but as I, now, was informed, I thought it impossible: and that nothing could happen to me so fatal, not even his Royal Highness's displeasure, as to leave the least ambiguity upon his mind, of my conduct. He asked what I meant by ambiguity. I said, to leave any doubt with his Royal Highness, or reason for him to suppose, that I would be for him, or absent, when he would afterwards hear that I was against him. He said it was very strange, that I would not be absent, when I had said, that I thought it natural that many gentlemen of great honour, and property would refuse to vote in this question. I replied, that I could not be absent, because I did not come under the latter part of the description I had made of them, for I had said, that what would make such gentlemen be absent, would be a motive of dissatisfaction against both, for having driven them to that extremity: now that could never be a motive with me, to whatsoever extremities I might be reduced. He said, he saw then that he was to expect me, and all my friends (meaning the Commoners) against him. I told him, that as to my friends, I had not dropp'd the least hint to them of this affair: that I hoped, for his sake, they would not see it in the light that I did; and did promise him, that I would use no one argument to induce them to do so: but for myself, it was with great concern I was obliged
<PB N="465" REF="475"/>
to say, that I must be against it, unless I could find reasons, which I did not, then, see, and which I be∣lieved it impossible to find, to be absent; if I did, I would certainly wait on his Royal Highness again, and let him know it: thus ended the most painful con∣versation I ever had, or, believe, I ever shall have, whilst I live.</P>
<P>As what is put down here, is only to aid my own memory, while the transaction is fresh, and in parti∣culars, only, where I was immediately concerned, I will not say when the Ministry first knew of this reso∣lution: though, I think, I have undeniable reasons to believe, they did not know it till Sunday the 13th, at soonest, more probably not till Monday the 14th, which is extremely surprising. On Wednesday the 16th it was publick, and I was stopp'd by several gentlemen in the House of Commons, who desired my opinion, which I gave to none. Sir Robert Walpole desired me to stay the rising of the House, that he might speak with me: I did so, and when the House was almost empty, we went behind the chair together. He was, then, so little informed of people's opinions, that he began by saying, that he desired to speak to me without reserve, and therefore would ask me, frankly, if upon this great question, I would give him a meeting: I an∣swered, that this great question was not new to me: that for three years preceding the two last, it had been the great struggle of my life to prevent it from break∣ing out then: that I would not have done so, if I had not entirely disapproved it; and that, from that time,
<PB N="466" REF="476"/>
up to this very hour, I had never seen any one reason to induce me to alter my opinion. He said it was a very handsome declaration, and he thanked me; but that I well knew many things were liable to be im∣puted to us, which we were not guilty of, and there∣fore beg'd me to speak to my friends. I said that I desired there might be no mistakes between us upon a subject of this importance; that I spoke for myself plainly, and openly, I always disapproved of this measure as pernicious, and fatal to the whole Royal Family, and as such, would give my publick dissent to it. As to what he called my friends, I supposed he meant Mr. Dodington; Mr. Wyndham, Mr. Beaghan, and the two Messrs. Tucker. He said, yes. I replied, that as to this matter, I would tell him the whole truth, in∣different how far he credited it: that it would be idle to tell him that I did not know of this measure, for I did, long since, but under such restrictions that hin∣dered me from communicating it to any body; that I regarded those ties, and had not even hinted it to any one of those gentlemen; but as the thing was, now, publick, I had already spoke to some of them, and did design to do so to the rest, to meet me, that night; but, as yet, could give him no manner of guess, as to their opinion in this matter. He again desired me not to do the thing by halves, because it would be im∣puted. I told him that they were independent gentle∣men; that though their fortunes were not large, yet they were sufficient, and they were resolved they always should be sufficient to keep them in independency; that he best knew they had not been regarded, or treated
<PB N="467" REF="477"/>
in a manner to give them any great present expectations. He interrupted me here, and said we understood one another; that what I said with relation to those gen∣tlemen was true, and had proceeded from not being in a situation to have it otherwise, [meaning the coldness between us.] I replied, that I did understand him, but as he knew they had no present expectations, I could by no means say how far they would care to for∣feit the prospect of all future favours, and advantages. He press'd me again to speak to them, for, indeed, it would be imputed. His repeating that so often, heated me a little, and made me tell him, that I very little regarded what might be imputed to me, unjustly: had I any pretensions? any expectations? What had I asked, or pretended? He knew I had none; if I had, let him say it. He said it was very true: that I must be sensible that there had been great misunderstandings between us, he was willing to suppose on both sides, but that so great a service as this, wiped out a multi∣tude of things. I answered, that what I should do was from a motive of my duty, that I neither asked, nor expected any reward for it, nor pretended any thing from it: that as to the gentlemen, I would, as I de∣signed, lay the matter fairly before them, and plainly tell them which way I should vote: whether my exam∣ple would influence them, they must determine, but I should use no arguments to do it.</P>
<P>I did so the same night: and they, from their own judgments, entirely unblassed, or attempted to be so, by me, all determined to vote for the King.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="478"/>On Sunday the 20th, about twelve gentlemen met at Sir Robert Walpole's, to be informed (as the custom is of all those meetings) of what is resolved upon; in∣stead of being consulted (as the custom ought to be) upon what should be resolved on.</P>
<P>When the company was gone, I told Sir Robert Walpole that I had laid the matter before the gentle∣men, and that I found they were disposed to act in the same manner, that I had declared I would do. He thanked me, and was going on (as I thought) to mention future expectations; but I prevented him, by continuing to say, that if I had been so unfortunate as to take another part in this unlucky affair, than that which the real sense of my duty, and zeal for the whole Royal Family had determined me to take, I believed he must be very sensible that the connection between those gentlemen and me was such, that we should not have differed in opinion. He said there could be no manner of doubt of it. I added that I, then, left him to consider whether, beside that real sense of my duty, I had had, from the day this King came upon the throne, up to that hour, any one inducement to do what I had resolved to do. He answered, to be sure not; the misunderstandings between him and me, were very publick, but now—and was going on, but I thought it not proper to enter into explanations, and interrupted him by saying, I did not mention this in any the least way of complaint, but thought I owed myself so much justice as to put him in mind of it: that as I acted from a principle of honour, and con∣science
<PB N="469" REF="479"/>
only, I was very regardless of the consequences that might happen to me from it; though I was not so blind as not to see that I stood exposed to future re∣sentments by it, at least as much as any gentleman in England; with which I took my leave. On Tuesday the 22d, the motion was made by Mr. Pulteney and seconded by Sir John Barnard: the message and answer produced by Sir Robert Walpole. The House divided between twelve and one: the numbers for the King were 234, for the Prince 204. There were 45 Tories absent; 35 members voted for the Prince against us, who, I think, never voted against us before.</P>
<P>On Friday the 25th, the same motion was made in the House of Lords, (where I was also) by Lord Carteret, and seconded by Lord Gower: the debate lasted till past eight, when the motion was rejected. The num∣bers for the King were; for the Prince.</P>
<P>Thus ended this unhappy affair in Parliament: God, only, knows where the consequences of it will end in a nation, where, by the profligacy, and disso∣luteness of their manners, the people seem to have for∣feited all pretence to the divine favour, and interposition; and where baseness, degeneracy, and corruption is ar∣rived to such a height, as to make them an easy prey, not only to the glaring qualities, and miscalled virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of great, ill designing Princes; but even to the most barefaced, despicable attempts of the weakest, when∣ever they shall think fit to employ a little low cunning, and open corruption to enslave them.</P>

<P>THAT his Royal Highness may be, thoroughly, convinced, that Mr. Dodington is, in earnest, disposed to be as serviceable to his Royal Highness, and this country, as his circumstances and abilities will give him leave, he has resigned the office he had the honour to hold, under his Majesty.</P>

<HEAD>Memorial for the Prince.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>October 12, 1749.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I must own I am under but little, per∣haps too little constraint, when I converse with your Royal Highness, in the familiarity of private life, which your condescension, often, calls me to. Yet, when I approach you in the light of a great Prince, of admirable endowments, by nature; highly improved by art and observation; a Prince with one foot on the throne of a, once, great, and powerful people; called thither by Providence, to prevent, or compleat its ruin: when I approach you in this light, and, above all, when I consider, that I am called to offer my serious opinion, relating to a conduct that must determine this awful event; I confess I am too much agitated,
<PB N="474" REF="483"/>
between the resolution of doing my duty to my country, and the fear of offending by too full, and plain a dis∣charge of it, to speak to your Royal Highness with that calmness of mind, that full possession of myself, which the greatness of the object, the operation, and the actor require, upon so solemn an occasion.</P>
<P>I have, therefore, chosen this way of memorial, as a means to lay my thoughts before your Royal Highness, in a less confused manner, and, at the same time, to give you an opportunity of examining them, as your leisure and inclination shall dictate: humbly hoping, only, that you will give them a full, and calm consi∣deration, as the settled opinion, after much reflection, of a man bound by duty, and impelled by gratitude and inclination, to prefer your true glory and interest, and the welfare of this country, (which are inseparable) to all other, earthly, considerations; and one, who looks upon the faithful discharge of this great duty, as the most important article he is answerable for, to Almighty God, before whom he expects, shortly, to appear.</P>
<P>As nobody has seen this paper; elegance, and accu∣curacy, it may, possibly, want: sincerity, and affection, it, certainly, will not: the head may err; the heart cannot.</P>
<P>I shall begin, Sir, with parliamentary affairs, so far forth, only, as they relate to the part your Royal High∣ness, in your present situation, ought to take in them,
<PB N="475" REF="484"/>
by those who are more immediately honoured with your character, and protection.</P>
<P>I chuse to begin with this head, because it is most pressing in point of time; because it is what you are, most deeply, engaged in; and because (though per∣haps unavoidably, at first) it is, now, become the source, and cause, of all the most considerable diffi∣culties you labour under; and which, each in its turn, may be the subject of different memorials, if you shall please to approve of this method of laying my thoughts before your Royal Highness.</P>
<P>The narrow measure of governing by a party, which has, unfortunately, attended the frequency of Parlia∣ments, (a thing, in itself, most desirable) seems to have been the occasion, that opposition has, too fre∣quently, changed its views, from the redress of grie∣vances, (its ancient, and only justifiable object) to a pursuit of private preferment, or private resentment. Let us take them separately, and see, if a Prince of Wales can appear at the head of either, consistent with his true greatness.</P>
<P>And first, let us consider an opposition carried on for the private preferment of the opposers.—Can a Prince of Wales be preferr'd?—He must be King; and as he can be nothing else, can such an opposition make him so, one hour before his time? or if it could, would he not reject it, with horror and indignation?</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="485"/>Let us, next, form to ourselves, an opposition founded upon resentment; a resolution to pull down, possibly to punish, those that have offended us, without considering consequences.</P>
<P>Will a Prince of Wales appear to act publickly, from resentment, and passion only? and that too, un∣der the disadvantage of appearing to do it, peevishly, personally, ineffectually, when he must, one day, have it in his power to do it, nobly, nationally, and effectually?</P>
<P>Having shewn that the ends, to which oppositions have been, usually, directed, are inconsistent with the interest, and true glory of a Prince of Wales, in your present situation; let us examine, if the methods of opposition, employed to attain those ends, are better calculated for your Royal Highness's great purposes.</P>
<P>In the first case, then, that I have stated, which is that of an opposition founded on self interest, only: the methods, in short, are, a steady, and unvariable attention to propose every thing that is specious, but impracticable, or unseasonable: to depreciate, and les∣sen every thing that is blameless, and to exaggerate and inflame every thing that is blameable; in order to make the people desire, and the Crown consent, to the dismission of those in power, and place, to make room for the leaders, and followers of the opposition. But a Prince of your elevation, Sir, cannot act as the head of any Administration; 'tis descending too low: nor can your followers act under any, without ceasing to
<PB N="477" REF="486"/>
be so. I humbly think, it is not your interest to drive them from you; and I am sure, it is not theirs, to quit the certain favour of a King, whom they will have contributed to make a great King, for the uncer∣tain, ill-will'd, precarious emoluments, which they may snatch, in the scramble of a new Administration, forced upon the Crown.</P>
<P>The methods of carrying on the second sort of op∣position I have mentioned, in which, resentment is the chief motive and ingredient, admit of a very short discussion: they are much the same, with the other, only heightened, and inflamed. Proposing things, not only unseasonable, but dangerous, and subversive of government itself: opposing right, and wrong, with equal vehemence: and endeavouring to overturn the whole system, rather than not reach those, who have the supreme direction of it. I presume, you, Sir, who are, by Providence, called to govern, will not contri∣bute to make all government impracticable, or sacrifice to resentment and passion, the welfare and prosperity of the people, in which, your own interest and glory, is inseparably implicated, and involved: nor will those who hope to govern under you, find their account, in such a method of opposition.</P>
<P>Be pleased, Sir, to let us make a little stand, here, to see what we have proved; and to consider, what consequences, necessarily, follow from the things proved, that ought to influence your present, and future conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="487"/>It is proved, I hope beyond all possibility of doubt, that the oppositions we have seen carried on, in this country, hitherto, are neither becoming your Royal Highness, in your present situation, nor advantageous to your followers: that such an opposition never can, either by its means, or its ends, establish that point, which, alone, ought to influence the publick actions of a Prince: of a Prince like you, Sir, who want only to be seen, as you really are, not as you are misrepre∣sented, (to which misrepresentations, the opposition has, unavoidably, furnished some foundation, and pre∣text) to become the sole object of mankind's expecta∣tion, for the redress of all the grievances they feel, and the dispensation of all the future benefits they hope for.</P>
<P>Admitting, then, all this to be proved, what follows from it? Are we to infer, that the opposition, which your Royal Highness countenanced and protected, was improperly, and injudiciously entered into, and consequently, that there ought to be no opposition at all? Are one, or both of these points, the doc∣trine you would establish?—Neither the one, nor the other.</P>
<P>I am ready to own, that considering the humiliating situation prepared for your Royal Highness, at your first coming to Britain, perhaps you had no means of procuring yourself a proper independency, but by having recourse to the unprincely weapon of oppo∣sition.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="488"/>I will, also, willingly, admit, that such an indepen∣dence was necessary to establish the dignity, and great∣ness of your representation, and to shew you, in the proper light of a mediator between the King and the people: one, from whom they are to hope, and ex∣pect every benefit they wanted, either by your inter∣cession with, or succession to sovereign power.</P>
<P>But as these concessions are true, and justify your conduct towards the attainment of that necessary inde∣pendence, your Royal Highness must, on the other side, own, that your being obliged to pursue it, by those means, has forced you to submit to many things, painful to you, in the execution: improper audiencies and applications, condescensions and familiarities, that, I humbly apprehend, you feared, and felt, must lessen that greatness, and publick significance, which, by the independence then struggled for, you were la∣bouring to advance, and establish.</P>
<P>Your Royal Highness must also allow, that, as this pursuit carried in its face the full likeness of a private, pecuniary establishment; the bulk of mankind, not being taught to see it as the foundation of that inde∣pendence necessary to make you their advocate, or their defender, in case they should be aggrieved; the bulk of mankind, I say, not being taught to see, or rather being taught not to see it, in that light, judged of it in gross, and, as it carried private interest in the face, concluded, (since you went into Court upon gaining your point) that the same private interest was inter∣woven
<PB N="480" REF="489"/>
with the whole, and composed the constituent, and essential parts of your intention, and design.</P>
<P>So that the unavoidable consequences of this method of opposition, became a drawback upon itself, and, in some degree, defeated its own success. For, though the necessary independency was established, there was, still, something wanting, to stamp, and impress upon the minds of the people, that exalted opinion, that servent, affectionate confidence and expectation, which the benevolence of your heart, and the force and ex∣tent of your natural genius (much embellished and improved) exact from all those, who have the happi∣ness to see your Royal Highness, in a near, and natural light: to find, and to fix this something, so as it may produce to my country, the full blessings of your most gracious intentions, and beneficent resolutions, is, un∣der Heaven, the whole object of all my care, pains, ambition, and reward.—Nor do I despair of success.</P>
<P>For I cannot believe, now the end is attained, that your Royal Highness will continue upon yourself those inconveniences, which it might be necessary to submit to, in order to attain it; we, indeed, your servants, by going on in the same eager method, and throwing your great name, and august patronage be∣fore us, might gratify our resentments, and possibly, our interests, by forcing ourselves into place under the Ministry: I say possibly might, but I verily believe, that there is not one of us, that harbours so mean a thought; and if any one differs in opinion with me,
<PB N="481" REF="490"/>
upon these great points, I humbly hope your Royal Highness will be persuaded, (as I am from the convic∣tion of my conscience) that it proceeds from a different conception of things, only, but from a heart as affec¦tionate, and zealous as my own, for your Royal High∣ness's true interest, and glory. But I, still, return to this point, that I do not imagine, that a Prince of your prudence and discernment, will continue a pursuit, that cannot, in all human probability, be attended with success: and if it was, could be employed to no desirable end, that falls within the compass of my poor comprehension.</P>
<P>The pursuit I mean, is a majority in Parliament, which I hold, morally, impossible to gain; and if it could be gained, I am entirely at a loss to guess, what advantageous use to your Royal Highness, could be made of it; on the contrary, I think it the thing, of all others, the least to be wished. For, if we were a sufficient majority to drive out the present Ministry, your Royal Highness would not, I presume, have us take their places; that were to drive us from you, in∣deed; for, in the present unhappy disposition of the Royal Family, you well know, that to keep the places, into which we had intruded, we must act like our pre∣decessors, very dishonourably, and disgracefully to ourselves, indeed, but certainly, very offensively to your Royal Highness. Besides, if we were that ma∣jority, with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>moluments, and temptations fall within reach, and in our power, is your Royal High∣ness
<PB N="482" REF="491"/>
very sure you could stop us, all, short, and hinder us from rushing in, to the plunder?</P>
<P>This great something, then, that is wanting, this necessary point of light, which is not to be found in the present methods, or ends of opposition, must be fixed and ascertained, in order to proportion, and adapt the means, to the measure.</P>
<P>Now, according to my understanding, this great, and necessary point is, to fix in the minds of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>kind, by the dignity, and steadiness of your own behaviour, a strong prepossession of your warm, and beneficent intentions for the welfare of this country, without private view, or resentment: and by such a choice of those, to whom you delegate the principal direction of your affairs, as may create a full confidence, that you are, not only thoroughly determined, but also, pro∣perly prepared, to carry those intentions into full execution, when you are vested with power to do it.</P>
<P>And, now, Sir, I, whom your Royal Highness may, hitherto, have thought an enemy to all opposition, be∣come an humble advocate, in my turn, for an opposi∣tion; such an one, as may be productive of this noble purpose, suitable to the greatness of your name, your reputation, and most princely accomplishments: an opposition strongly marked with the publick good, where your private views, all, plainly, center in the publick welfare; and those of your followers, are
<PB N="483" REF="492"/>
openly, and declaredly, confined to the honour of, one day, carrying your great designs into execution; till that time, to ask for nothing, to accept of nothing, but devote themselves to watch over the public, and prevent, as far as they can, any farther encroachments being made upon it, till, by becoming the glorious instruments of your gracious intentions, they can redress all the grievances, they have not been able to prevent.</P>
<P>The noble simplicity of this opposition, supported with suitable gravity, steadiness, and dignity, without doors, will awake, and fix the attention of mankind on your Royal Highness, as their proper object of defence, and ex∣pectation. And even those personal points, which, though most justly grounded, and ably supported, would, now, be attempted ineffectually, as the movements of resent∣ment, only, and end in a sanction, instead of a censure: the prosecution of those very points, will, when your power to punish, as well as reward, is equal to your will, be called for, by the people, as national justice, and publick satisfaction.</P>
<P>To the standard of an opposition thus strongly marked, and characterized with the publick good, and the publick good, only; thus cleared from every cloud, and stain of private interest, and resentment; the honest, the brave, and the impartial, will gather, by degrees, and no slow ones, to increase the dignity, as w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll as numbers, of your Royal Highness's party. But while they see, or think they see, the least appearance
<PB N="484" REF="493"/>
of trifling with the public; or, indeed, till they see the contrary, in my humble opinion, the prospect is so full of misfortune, that I chuse to hide it from your Royal Highness, and wish I could hide it from myself.</P>
<P>All which, is humbly submitted to your Royal High∣ness's superior discernment, and direction.</P>

<HEAD>This narrative of Mr. Ralph appears to be a jus∣tification of Mr. Dodington, from a malicious report that he had intruded himself upon the late Prince of Wales, and had forced himself into the service of his Royal Highness. It was written in the year <HI>1751,</HI> and is occasionally hinted at in the Diary.</HEAD>
<P>IT pleased his late Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, sometimes to discourse of political matters with Mr. Ralph.</P>
<P>On all such occasions, the Earl of Middlesex was present; and sometimes Dr. Sharpe.</P>
<P>These discourses were generally pretty long; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seldom happened, but that his Royal Highness men∣tioned
<PB N="485" REF="494"/>
Mr. Dodington's name before they were brought to an end: sometimes with complaints that he, Mr. Dodington, had left his Royal Highness, but oftener with expressions of self-persuasion, that he should re∣cover him again one day or another.—Adding these, or such words as these—"we have good subalterns enough; but we want leaders."</P>
<P>Mr. Ralph, all this while, either kept on the reserve, or threw in such general suggestions concerning Mr. Dodington, as were rather dictated by sentiment than policy.</P>
<P>Once, and but once, when the conversation grew very particular, he did most humbly offer himself to communicate his Royal Highness's commands to Mr. Dodington, in case he had any to communicate, and should think fit to do him (Mr. Ralph) that honour. But his Royal Highness waved the motion at that time, by saying, Lord Baltimore had been spoken to on that head; and, therefore, when he had any thing to say, his Lordship would be the most proper person to say it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, at some distance of time, his Royal Highness resumed the topick one evening; and, at parting, clapping his hand on Mr. Ralph's arm, dropped certain expressions, which, to the best of Mr. Ralph's remembrance, were these—Dear Ralph, or, good Ralph, get me Dodington, if possible—I must have Dodington at any rate.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="495"/>Mr. Ralph was rather perplexed, than pleased, with this commission: and Dr. Sharpe coming to him at Turnham Green, (he believes to know his (Mr. Ralph's) opinion concerning it) Mr. Ralph told him he could not proceed upon it, as it was too general; and, consequently, tended more to draw him into a difficulty, with Mr. Dodington, than to answer his Royal Highness's purpose.</P>
<P>What followed was an order for him to come to town immediately; which, on his arrival, was fol∣lowed by another, requiring him, expressly, in the name of his Royal Highness, to invite Mr. Dodington into his Royal Highness's service; or rather, as it was phrased, to live with him, as he had formerly done, and as if that sort of life had never been interrupted: which in∣vitation was unaccompanied with any offer or stipula∣tion of any kind whatsoever. Nay; when Mr. Ralph asked—if no character or employment, either in present or future, was allotted to him; the answer given, was, that nothing of either kind had been so much as men∣tioned.</P>
<P>This invitation Mr. Ralph carried to Mr. Doding∣ton, who took two or three days to consider of it; and, having, in that interval, resigned his employment, did, by Mr. Ralph, send a letter, to be delivered into the hands of Lord Middlesex, (who was the person em∣ployed by his Royal Highness in this transaction) the contents of which Mr. Dodington is best able to explain.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="496"/>About four months passed over, after this, without producing any farther explanation of either side; during which interval (though Mr. Ralph did wonder much, that his Royal Highness should be so earnest to have a gentleman at his devotion, whom he did not seem to have any commands for, and might, possibly, take the liberty to express that wonder to his friends at times) he never once presumed to importune his Royal High∣ness, or to desire, that he might be importuned on Mr. Dodington's account.</P>
<P>Lastly; when his Royal Highness did, of his <HI>own</HI> mere motion, as Mr. Ralph apprehends, take Mr. Dodington into his actual service, he, Mr. Dodington, did require Mr. Ralph, by and through my Lord Mid∣dlesex, to repeat the humble request, which he had be∣fore made to him in person; viz. that he might have the honour to serve him without salary, till it pleased God, that his Royal Highness should accede to the Throne. Mr. Ralph did, accordingly, communicate this request to my Lord Middlesex, to be communicated to his Royal Highness, which his Royal Highness re∣fused to admit: notwithstanding which, Mr. Doding∣ton did again renew the same solicitation, and persist in it, through the same channel; till Mr. Ralph was, at last, told by my Lord Middlesex, that his Royal Highness was so firm to his purpose, on that head, that he did not think it adviseable to press him any farther.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I UNDERSTAND, by Mr. Fox, and by a letter from your Grace to Lord Hallifax, that the King is disposed to accept my services: and I am very ready to serve him, if I can do it, with utility to his Majesty and with honour to myself: for I do not want the ser∣vice, either to mend my fortune, or for an introduction into the world; I want it for neither. I am come, therefore my Lord, to know of your Grace, in what, and in what shape and situation his Majesty expects my services.</P>
<P>He said it was true: and that the King had received what he laid before his Majesty of my zeal for his fa∣mily, and of my abilities, much more favourably of late, than when he formerly had done all that he could with his Majesty, to—</P>
<P>My Lord, I beg we may not look back: that, I am sure, will not advance any thing I came hither about.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="498"/>He said it was very obliging in me, to forget what was pass'd—but he must have his own thoughts about it.</P>
<P>And I, mine, my Lord.</P>
<P>He proceeded to say, that as Mr. Fox was a person agreeable to me, the King had directed that Mr. Fox should come to Dorsetshire to me, to settle matters, and that his Majesty would consent to any thing for myself, that I liked and should be agreed amongst us; not then knowing that I should be so soon at Hammersmith.</P>
<P>I said I had seen Mr. Fox, and that he had spoke to me, in generals only, about publick affairs, and his Majesty's favourable disposition to me.</P>
<P>He said he understood it so: and that Mr. Fox had, only, reported that I was well disposed to enter into the service, and if measures could be made agreeable, I had no objection to men.—And that, if there was any thing I liked, and would let it be known, it might be shaped out to my satisfaction, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My Lord, where there is no offer, no answer can be expected.</P>
<P>He said, all would depend upon measures, if those could be made agreeable, every thing would be made easy; and therefore it would be proper to go upon that.</P>
<P>My Lord, if your Grace pleases, one thing at once.
<PB N="490" REF="499"/>
As you have no offer to make, you can expect no an∣swer upon that head: and be pleased to observe that <HI>I</HI> have nothing to offer, and nothing to ask.</P>
<P>Why, to be sure, he said, if what was thought of was not agreeable, any thing else that I liked, migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be brought about: but what the King first thought of, was the Comptroller's Staff.</P>
<P>My Lord, I will suppose I did not hear you, and as <HI>you</HI> have nothing to offer, and <HI>I</HI> have nothing to ask, there can be no answer, and we may shut the book.</P>
<P>He said, that, if they had known I should not have liked the Staff, it would not have been thought of.</P>
<P>My Lord, it should not have been thought of.—If you please, my Lord, let us suppose that nothing speci∣fical has been offered: and I repeat my expectation that your Grace will remember, that I have nothing to offer, or propose to you, and nothing to ask.</P>
<P>He said, he understood it so: and that I came, at his Majesty's requisition, who was desirous I should come into the service. And as for measures, they had no particular ones, but the two treaties with Hesse, and Russia, which last, had been negociating, these two years (what he meant by that, I neither know, nor thought proper to ask) and he supposed Mr. Fox had explained them.</P>
<P><PB N="491" REF="500"/>Upon my answering in the negative, and saying that I did not believe that Mr. Fox understood them, tho∣roughly, himself; his Grace began to enter into that with Russia; but I stopp'd him, by saying that, I sup∣posed they were two subsidiary treaties, which, like all others, bargained for a certain number of men, for a certain time: so much subsidy to the Princes and such pay to the troops, when called for.</P>
<P>Yes—exactly so—and then proceeded to shew that the Russian treaty was the best, and only way to defend Hanover, and prevent a Continent war. That if Ha∣nover was attacked for the sake of England, it ought to be looked upon as England, &amp;c. and then would have gone on into the particulars, but I interrupted him, by saying, then I would not lose your Grace's time, in explanation, which can only affect the mode of the thing, and not the substance; I may possibly, think of it, as of a dish dressed by your Grace's cook, the more palatable, the more unwholesome. But I will be plain with your Grace; I think this Russian subsidy to be ruinous to this country, of most dangerous precedent, most hurtful to his Majesty's true interest, and destructive of the interest of his family: at the same time, insufficient to the ends proposed by it, and instead of preventing a Continental war, the most certain seed, and foundation of it. And I can never think I am serving his Majesty by supporting it.</P>
<P>At the same time I will agree with your Grace, and am willing it should be understood, I am for defending
<PB N="492" REF="501"/>
Hanover, if it be attacked out of resentment to England, and that I not only never will consent to, but will hinder, to the best of my poor little power, the swords being sheathed, till Hanover be indemnified. I will go farther, and will allow without farther examination, that if it be, now, attacked, it is on the account of England:—but I do not think this Russian subsidy is the way to defend it, or to make the people fond of it. Besides, my Lord, your Grace knows, and I know that (without this Russian subsidy) it will never be at∣tacked. He said, he wished he did, that if I could convince him of that, it would be the best news that had come to England a great while.</P>
<P>I do know it, my Lord, and I thought your Grace had: unless we are to suppose that people will do the direct contrary to what they have promised, and enga∣ged to do.</P>
<P>But at the same time I say this, of the Russian sub∣sidy, your Grace will observe that <HI>I do not say</HI> that I will be for the Hessian: I desire not to be misunderstood, or misrepresented. Oh no! he understood me very well, and would be sure not to misrepresent me any where.</P>
<P>My Lord, I will not be misrepresented. I do not say that I will approve of the Hessian subsidy, if there were no Russian, because considered by itself, 'tis a silly, unadvised step, the best one can think of it, or call it, is a jobb; 'tis so apparently of no significancy,
<PB N="493" REF="502"/>
and inadequate to the purposes held out; and nobody can think you in earnest when you declare them: but, however, as to that, there may be modes and qualifi∣cations, especially, as <HI>that</HI> is ratified, and concluded, (and your Grace says that you are not sure you shall get the other) and as great respect to, and desire to comply with his Majesty's word, when it was solemnly engaged, is our duty, as far as is consistent with our duty to our country; I say, there may, possibly, be found some temperament, in that case single, that might enable one to speak to gentlemen, and one's friends; and if, upon proper explanations, they were disposed to make so great a compliment, I should not endeavour to enflame, but rather, possibly be inclined to acquiesce. After a little, and not very material in∣terruption, I resumed the discourse, and said;</P>
<P>My Lord, I did not come here, to dispute with your Grace: my opinion of the general tendency of these subsidies, both at home, and abroad, will admit of no variation; and it is fit that I should acquaint your Grace, that as to the Russian, I will oppose it, with all the little credit, and efficacy I have, both in the House, and out of it: but I will do it with all the decency that is consistent with truth. He said, they were convinced of the great decency of my behaviour, on all occasions. And I went on to say, that as to the Hessians, I did not say that I would be for them: that point, however, might admit of some modifica∣tion: but if they, both, came in, I would indubitably
<PB N="494" REF="503"/>
oppose both, for, whatever I did, I would do tho∣roughly.</P>
<P>After civil expressions of concern, that we did not agree in our opinion about measures, he let him∣self into the danger of provoking other maritime Princes to join France against us; from the present, too openly professed doctrine of being masters of the seas: that Sweden, and Denmark, would in conjunc∣tion with France, have a fleet of fifty sail, in the Baltic, &amp;c.—that we had the greatest fleet, the best provided, officer'd, and directed that ever was: that I saw it could not be depended upon: they could not hinder squadrons from going out, and coming in, through the most winding, difficult passages, &amp;c. I got up, and said, if we were not superior at sea, we must give it up: that I had taken up too much of his time, and beg'd leave to recapitulate what had passed, that there might be no room for mistake, or misrepre∣sentation: that, in the first place, as to myself, I had made no manner of offer, nor asked any thing, of any body: that as to measures, for the Hessian subsidy, I had no ways said that I would be for it, if it came single; but, in that case, it might admit of farther consideration; but if it was to be combined with the Russian, I would most certainly oppose both: that I had said I would oppose the Russian, to the utmost of my power, but with all the decency that truth would ad∣mit: that there remained but one thing, and that was not recapitulation, because I had not said it before, which was, that he should find, (though I did not
<PB N="495" REF="504"/>
know whether ever they told him one word of truth) he should find (if they did) that I opposed it solely from the unfitness of the thing, and not because any body, there, thought fit to oppose it: that I should shew it was from opinion, my own opinion only; and not from any body's else; or out of dislike to, or against any body, that I opposed it. I was unconnected with any one, and would be so, upon this question: how lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g I should continue so, I could not tell, but I was so, now. Nobody had any demand, any right to call upon me, but one gentleman, a near relation of his Grace's, Lord Hallifax; he had a right, and when he did call, at any time, and upon any occasion, I should always be ready to obey it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Goodwood,
<DATE>June 21, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to Mr. Wyndham for the com∣munication he has allowed you to make to me of Mr. Dodington's Diary, which has afforded me great en∣tertainment, for few readings in my opinion are more amusing than this sort of original memoirs, which give the truest picture of the times in which they were written.</P>
<P>As the excellence of such a work consists in its being perfectly original, the smallest alteration would in my opinion destroy its merit; and therefore, although the
<PB N="498" REF="507"/>
part, where I am mentioned, contains by no means a true state of that business, yet I am far from wishing to have it suppressed or altered. All I desire is, that, when Mr. Wyndham thinks proper to publish Mr. Doding∣ton's Diary, he will permit this letter containing the true state of facts to be inserted as an explanatory note to that transaction.</P>
<P>Soon after his Majesty's accession, Sir Harry Erskine, who had been removed from the Army by the late King, was restored to it by his present Majesty with the same rank he would have had, if he had continued in the service; by this means he came in again over my head. This induced me to desire an audience, in which I respectfully represented to his Majesty that, as I had particularly attached myself to the Military, and had sought service upon all occasions, I was in hopes that no person would have been put over me. But finding from his Majesty's answer, that Sir Harry Erskine's removal in the late reign was owing to his attachment to his Majesty when Prince of Wales, and that he had then made him a promise to restore him to his rank when he should come to the Crown, I most chearfully submitted, and beg'd of his Majesty to be∣lieve, that nothing could be further from my wish, than that he should break his word on any account, and particularly on mine. His Majesty then asked me, how it happened that I had never thought of any other line than the Military? my answer was, that I had not chose to put myself under an obligation to the Duke of Newcastle or even to my brother-in-law Mr. Fox,
<PB N="499" REF="508"/>
being unwilling to connect myself with any Minister. His Majesty was pleased to receive very graciously all I had said.</P>
<P>Being present at the next leveè day, Lord Bute took me aside and told me the King was much pleased with my behaviour in the closet: that his Majesty had ob∣served my saying that I had never thought of any line but the Military, and had ordered him to <HI>sound me</HI> (I perfectly well recollect the expression) whether I should have any inclination to a civil employment? Lord Bute added, that he thought the best way of <HI>sounding</HI> was at once to tell me the whole. That the King thought of making me a Lord of his Bedchamber; that I might know it would not be proper for the King to make a formal offer, but that, if I was disposed to have it, I might ask it, and he could assure me I should not be refused. I thanked his Lordship, expressed my gratitude to his Majesty, and desired twenty-four hours to consider of it. I then asked for it in form and was immediately appointed.</P>
<P>A few days after I had kissed hands, news arrived of the battle of Closter Campen in Germany, in which the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, who commanded there, had been worsted. Lord Shelburne (then Lord Fitzmaurice) had been present at this action as a vo∣lunteer: Lord Downe commanded the 25th regiment and received the wounds of which he afterwards died: my brother, Lord George Lennox, commanded a bat∣talion of British grenadiers; he had been in the hottest
<PB N="500" REF="509"/>
part of the action, and, although he had the good luck not to be hurt, his cloaths were shot through in several places, and he had the peculiar satisfaction of remaining to the very last with the Hereditary Prince in the wood, which was the scene of action, and when all his people were either killed or driven off, he, with a captain Mac Lane, actually carried off in their arms the Hereditary Prince who had no horse or attendants, and who from the wound he had received in his leg, was unable to walk. Lord Fitzmaurice and Lord Downe were both junior Lieutenant Colonels to Lord George Lennox, but his Majesty was advised to reward their services in this action by giving them the rank of Colonel over his head.</P>
<P>I thought it my duty to represent to his Majesty how great a mortification it must be to my brother, after having much distinguished himself during the whole war, to be not only neglected, but even to see his juniors rewarded by being put over his head for their services in this battle, where his behaviour had been so remar∣kable.</P>
<P>My representations however proved ineffectual; upon which I resigned the Bedchamber, a fortnight after I had received it. I afterwards communicated to Lord Bute the step I had taken, but have not the smallest recollection of his Lordship's mentioning to me
<Q>“My having talked offensively of the Scotch on the pro∣motion of Sir Harry Erskine and of him (Bute) in ”particular.</Q>
On the contrary his Lordship was very
<PB N="501" REF="510"/>
civil to me, and expressed his regret that I had not first communicated to him my intentions of resigning, as possibly he might have found means to satisfy me about my brother, and have prevented my quitting the Bedchamber.</P>
<P>But the point I am most anxious to clear up is Mr. Dodington's assertion, that the account which Lord Hallifax said I had given "That the King sent and offered me the Bedchamber"—<HI>is not true</HI>—the account I have given will shew whether Lord Bute was not <HI>sent</HI> to me; and whether the manner in which his Lordship expressed the orders he had received to <HI>sound me</HI> do not in the language of plain dealing amount to an <HI>offer of the Bed∣chamber from the King</HI>. It is true that I did ask it in form (I believe by letter to Lord Bute) but this was subsequent to, and in consequence of his orders to <HI>sound me</HI> and not at the audience I had on the business of Sir Harry Erskine's affair, which was previous, for I do very positively declare that till Lord Bute menti∣oned the Bedchamber to me in that conversation, as an idea of the King's, it had not entered into my thoughts, which were never turned to that sort of employment.</P>
<P>The difference of whether I first asked for, or was offered this place, is very immaterial except as to the charge Mr. Dodington brings against me of having said <HI>what is not true</HI>. For, altho' it was very flattering to me to be thought of by his Majesty to be about his person, I had not the silly impertinence to be above asking for that honour, if my turn of mind had led me
<PB N="502" REF="511"/>
that way, but I cannot feel indifferent as to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act which I am stated to have misrepresented.</P>

<HEAD>A Memorial of several Noblemen and Gentlemen of the first rank and fortune.</HEAD>
<P>THE memorialists represent—That the education of a Prince of Wales is an object of the utmost im∣portance to the whole nation; that it ought always to be intrusted to Noblemen of the most unblemished honour, and to Prelates of the most distinguished vir∣tue, of the most accomplished learning, and of the most unsuspected principles, with regard to Govern∣ment both in Church and State.</P>

<P><PB N="ii" REF="515"/>That the misfortunes which the nation formerly suffered, or escaped, under King Charles I. King Charles II. and King James II. were owing to the bad education of those Princes, who were early ini∣tiated in maxims of arbitrary power: —That for a faction to engross the education of a Prince of Wales to themselves, excluding men of probity and learn∣ing, is unwarrantable, dangerous, and illegal:—That to place men about the Prince of Wales, whose prin∣ciples are suspected, and whose belief in the mysteries of our faith is doubtful, has the most mischievous tendency, and ought justly to alarm the friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their country, and of the Protestant succession:—That for a minister to support low men, who were origi∣nally improper for the high trust to which they were advanced, after complaints made of dark suspicions, and unwarrantable methods made use of by such men in their plan of education, and to protect and counte∣nance such men in their insolent and unheard-of be∣haviour to their superiors, is a foundation for sus∣pecting the worst designs in such ministers, and ought to make all good men apprehensive of the ambition of those ministers:—That it being notorious, that books inculcating the worst maxims of government, and de∣fending the most avowed tyrannies, have been put into the hands of the Prince of Wales, it cannot but affect the memorialists with the most melancholy apprehen∣sions, when they find that the men who had the ho∣nesly and the resolution to complain of such astonish∣ing methods of instruction, are driven away from court, and the men who have dared to teach such
<PB N="iii" REF="516"/>
doctrine are continued in trust and favour:—That the security of this government being built on Whig prin∣ciples, and alone supported by Whig zeal; that the establishment of the present Royal Family being settled in the timely overthrow of Queen Anne's last ministry, it cannot but alarm all true Whigs to hear of schoolmasters, of very contrary principles, being thought of for preceptors; and to see none but the friends and pupils of the late Lord Bolingbroke en∣trusted with the education of a Prince, whose family that very Lord endeavoured by his measures to ex∣clude, and by his writings to expel, from the throne of these kingdoms: — That there being great reason to believe that a noble Lord has accused one of the Pre∣ceptors of Jacobitism, it is astonishing that no notice has been taken of a complaint of so high a nature: — On the contrary, the accused person continues in the same trust, without any enquiry into the grounds of the charge, or any steps taken by the accused to purge himself of a crime of so black a dye:—That no sa∣tisfaction being given to the Governor and Preceptor, one of whom, though a Nobleman of the most unble∣mished honour, and the other a Prelate of the most unbiassed virtue, have been treated in the grossest terms of abuse by a menial servant of the family, it is derogatory to his Majesty's authority, under which they acted, is an affront to the Peerage, and an out∣rage to the dignity of the Church:—That whoever advised the refusal of an audience to the Bishop of Norwich, who was so justly alarmed at the wrong methods which he saw taken in the education of the
<PB N="iv" REF="517"/>
Prince of Wales, is an enemy to his country, and can only mean at least to govern by a faction, which in∣tends to overthrow the government, and restore the exiled and arbitrary house of Stuart:—That to have a Scotsman, of a most disaffected family, and allied in the nearest manner to the Pretender's first ministers, consulted in the education of the Prince of Wales, and entrusted with the most important secrets of go∣vernment, must tend to alarm and disgust the friends of the present Royal family, and to encourage the hopes and attempts of the Jacobites. — Lastly, the Me∣morialists cannot help remarking, that the three or four low, dark, suspected persons, are the only men whose station is fixed and permanent; but that all the great offices and officers are so constantly varied and shuffled about, to the disgrace of this country, that the best persons apprehend there is a settled design in these low and suspected people to infuse such jea∣lousies, caprices, and sickleness, into the two mini∣sters, whose confidence they engross, as may render this government ridiculous and contemptible, and fa∣cilitate the revolution which the Memorialists think they have but too much reason to fear is meditating.</P>
