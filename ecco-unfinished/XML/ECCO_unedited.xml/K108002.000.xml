<P>THIS Enquiry was printed off before we met the following Particulars, which be∣ing, as we judge, very remarkable, the Reader is desired to add 'em to Page the 25th, after the Certificate of the <HI>Formosan</HI> Cha∣racters.</P>
<P><Q>“The Isle <HI>Formosa</HI> called by the <HI>Chinese Pac∣cande</HI>, a hundred and thirty Leagues in Cir∣cuit, is full of populous villages, <HI>governed by ”several Lords at War one with another</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Isle is divided into Eleven Provinces, or Shires. <HI>The First</HI> contains the Towns of <HI>Sinkan</HI>, and Eleven more, formerly under the <HI>Hollanders. The Second</HI> is <HI>Kabelany</HI>, and con∣tains Seventy Two Towns and Villages, which the <HI>Hollanders could not subdue, but made Peace with them, The Third</HI> belongs to the King of <HI>Middag</HI>, and is <HI>North East of Taya∣van</HI>, southward of the River <HI>Patientia</HI>, has Seventeen Towns. <HI>The Fourth, Pimaba</HI>,
<PB REF="6"/>
Eight Towns, and several Villages. <HI>The Fifth, Sapat</HI>, on the other side <HI>Formosa</HI>, [East of <HI>Tayavan</HI>] has Ten Towns. <HI>The Sixth, Taka∣bolder</HI>, has eight Towns, and several Villages, <HI>Here is a Mountain that may be seen from</HI> Tayavan. <HI>The Seventh, Cardeman</HI>, has Five Villages, and was governed by a Woman, <HI>who sent the</HI> Hollanders <HI>Provisions when they march∣ed into the Field. The Eighth</HI> has Twelve Vil∣lages. <HI>The Ninth, Tokodekal</HI>, has Seven Towns, and Seven Villages. <HI>The Tenth, Puk∣kall</HI>, is one City. <HI>The Eleventh, Percuzzi</HI> and <HI>Perguni</HI>, Two Towns. Besides all these, <HI>there ”are abundance of Lordships in the Mountains</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“For the Privilege of Fishing under this Isle, <HI>the Chinese used to pay the Tyth of all Fish for ”Custom to the</HI> Hollanders.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Against the North-East Part of <HI>Formosa</HI> lies a great and rich Gold Mine,—at the Foot [of the Mountain] runs a River with many winding Reaches; so that they who go in quest of the Gold must cross the Stream above twen∣ty times, and with great Danger from the ”Stones that fall from the Rocks.</Q></P>
<P>"<HI>These Mountains have not hitherto been con¦quer'd "by any.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have often endeavour'd to go some Ground on these Highlands, but were re¦”pulsed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>The Men</HI> of <HI>Formosa</HI> are very large, in the plain Country.—They <HI>of the Mountains are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦”lesser Stature</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“When any dye, the Friends of the Deceas'd flock together, and bring with 'em Store o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ”<HI>Man's Flesh</HI>, and several intoxicating Liquors.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>"In the Winter they wear <HI>Bears and other "wild Beasts Skins</HI>.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Their usual Diet is</HI> dryed Venison, Flesh of wild Swine and Fish, all which they eat raw, ”without seething or roasting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Their Houses built of Wood, and split Cane. —The foremost Part of the Foundation <HI>re∣sembles a Semicircle, or half Moon</HI>; and like∣wise the Roof over the Front. <HI>Every House is almost Sixty Foot broad, and Two Hundred Foot ”long, with only one Room, and one Story.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“<HI>All the</HI> Formosans much differ from one ano∣ther in Speech, so that you shall seldom find two or three Villages, tho' but three or four Leagues asunder, where their dialect does not vary so very much that they are forced to use Inter∣”preters.</Q></P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Island <HI>Tayavan</HI>.</HEAD>
<P><Q>“<HI>ON the North side</HI> of <HI>Tayavan</HI>, on a Sand Hill, stands the Fort <HI>Zealandia:</HI> Un∣der the Castle Westward lies another Fort, ”Square, guarded by two Points of the Sea.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“A Bow shot distant lies a strong out-work, being the Key to the Castle called <HI>Utrech</HI>;— Eastward of which stands <HI>a Town built also by the</HI> Netherlanders, <HI>called by the Name of the ”Isle</HI> [Tayavan] <HI>about a Mile in Circumference</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Most of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tayavan</HI> are at present outlaw'd <HI>Chinese</HI>, who will not acknow∣ledge the <HI>Tartar</HI>, these taking it from the <HI>Hol∣landers, Anno</HI> 1661, brought all under the ”Subjection of their General <HI>Coxinga</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>Thus <HI>Arnoldus Montanus</HI> out of <HI>David Wright</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It is plain from hence, that the Island <HI>Formo∣sa</HI> is very populous; has many Kingdoms; was not under <HI>China</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were there, for they had Toll from the <HI>Chinese</HI>; that the <HI>Dutch</HI> never subdued more than a small part of the Coast, and could make Peace with but a few of the other Princes, but could never get to the Gold Mines. And that <HI>Coxinga</HI> went no farther than the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and therefore tho' <HI>Tayavan</HI> and the Coast where <HI>Sinkan</HI> stood, may belong to <HI>China, the rest does not, nor ever did</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, That they <HI>eat raw Meat, and human Flesh</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>, That they <HI>have many Languages un∣known to each other</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>, That the <HI>mountainous part</HI> or rather <HI>Upland</HI>, being, as it appears, all the North Part of the Isle from <HI>Tayavan, is yet unknown</HI>. For the South being about one fourth of the whole is capable of containing all these Provinces and Towns, which could not lie far asunder. For a Mountain in the Sixth is seen at <HI>Tayavan</HI>, and the Queen of the Seventh sent Provision to the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their Marches, and they reach from Sea to Sea, and yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> got no ground up∣on the <HI>Highlands</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly</HI>, That <HI>there are Gold Mines in</HI> Formosa.</P>
<P>All which make <HI>Ps—r</HI>'s Account highly probable in the whole, and confirm it in some material Parts.</P>

<HEAD>An Impartial ENQUIRY INTO THE OBJECTIONS Against <HI>George Psalmanaazaar</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>HAD this Inquiry been intended to vin∣dicate <HI>Geo. P—r</HI> farther than he shall appear to merit it, a different Method should have been persued, and some very eloquent Person procured to have undertaken his Defence. And, no doubt, we might have had as good Success as others in the use of the same means to contrary purposes.</P>
<P>But our Intent being only to find out the Truth concerning him, we did not think it neces∣sary to engage any Advocates. Tho' we have no Schollars among us, yet we thought an ho∣nest industrious natural Reason sufficient both to manage our Inquiry, and direct our Judgment up∣on it. Especially, since we do not direct others,
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
but leave every Reader to judge for himself. And since we look for no other return than to be told whether we are mistaken, and in what Par∣ticular.</P>
<P>Were it only that the Respect shewn by us to <HI>P—r</HI> might not be misplaced, we should never trouble the World with asking any thing about him. The debate is of far greater Consequence, as we think. The Reputation of our Church, and the propagating our Religion seem very much concerned in it. If <HI>P—r</HI> be sincere, he is as no∣ble an Instance of the Excellency of our Church above any particular Church of Christendom as can be wisht; and he may carry this excellent Re∣ligion to <HI>Japan</HI> and all its dependencies.</P>
<P>Their more immediate Concerns both Ecclesi∣astick and Civil have, as we suppose, rendred it impracticable for the most proper Judges to make this Inquiry, which some have perplext as much as they could. The many Objects of Charity, concerning whose Merit there can be no debate, have made it seem unnecessary to many others, who think his fitness to receive their Benefactions the only Reason they have to inquire about him. And it seems the more Curious have been discou∣raged from it by not attending to the different Cir∣cumstances of things called by the same Names, and to some things in the common Accounts of <HI>Formosa</HI>, which go a great way to clear up the matter. And therefore we thought our selves the only Persons that would undertake this Affair; and hope our Sincerity may atone for want of E¦loquence and all other Endowments necessary for the better setting forth this Inquiry.</P>
<P>Had we known as much of the World as the Gentlemen last named before we had been at al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquainted with <HI>P—r</HI>, we should very probably
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
have let him passed as they do: But he was brought among us by a pious Member of the Church, who without any design, save the Service of Piety, had made himself acquainted with him; and none of us had heard any Objections against him before we saw his Christian Behaviour, which made us thus zealous to inquire into the Validity of these Objections. And here we omitted no∣thing that was thought any way conducing to our fuller Information. We got all the printed Ac∣counts we could hear of, and inquired of as ma∣ny Travellers as we met with; we talkt with Friends and Enemies, we put out publick No∣tices of our Inquiry, and intreated, and as far as good Manners permitted, even challenged the World to send us what they have to say against him; and shall faithfully set down all we met with upon every hand, and hope if any thing yet remains, it will fall under the Rules by which we have been able to make our Judgments of those we met with. And therefore the World from henceforth may fully determine about <HI>P—r</HI>, and the Church make use of him if not for propaga∣ting the Faith, yet as an instance of the Good∣ness and Excellency of her Doctrine and Consti∣tution.</P>
<P>For the better making this Determination, the Objections shall be disposed into three general Heads.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>, Such as are raised from the Difference betwixt his and our Accounts of <HI>Formosa</HI>, which as some say are so very inconsistent as to render his whole Account suspected.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, Such as arise from the Particulars in his Account, which say others must be allowed false tho' we should admit his Account to be true in the main.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"/><HI>Lastly</HI>, Such as are taken from the Colour of his Skin, his Hair, his Mien, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which say others are sufficient to disprove his being of <HI>Formosa</HI>, tho' his Account and all the Parts be true.</P>
<P>Under the first Head will come to be consider'd (1) All our printed Accounts of <HI>Formosa</HI>, and (2) two MSS. Letters from a Merchant of <HI>Suf∣folk</HI>, and (3) the Account given <HI>viva voce</HI> by the Rev.— of <HI>Oxford</HI>, who has lately been in <HI>East India</HI> upon curious Inquiries, and this among the rest.</P>
<P>To the second Head will be reducible an Ac∣count of two Letters from <HI>Avignon</HI> (2) all the Ob∣jections we received in Writing. (3) The printed Eclaircissements of Mr. <HI>D. Amalvy</HI> the <HI>Calvinist</HI> Teacher of <HI>Sluice</HI>. And (4) most of the Obje∣ctions we at any time have met in our verbal In∣quiries about him.</P>
<P N="1">§. I. <HI>First</HI>, It seems most proper to begin with that Objection which is the most formidable, and strikes at his whole Story, because of the manifest Difference between it and all our Accounts of the same place. For if this be so, if they do indeed differ so very much it seems impossible they should be true on both sides, and then we must give the Preference to our own Accounts, as being ma∣ny, and well attested, and always received.</P>
<P>Now tho' the Learned do not need it, yet we hope they will pardon us, if for the sake of others we set down a short History of <HI>Formosa</HI> from our own Accounts both Printed and Written, and of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. We find that before the <HI>Dutch</HI> came thither there was an Emporium very near it upon a small Island called <HI>Tyavan</HI>, whose Bigness, Site and
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
Conveniency for Trade may appear to the Reader from the Map annext.</P>
<P>This Map we have from a Copy brought from the <HI>East Indias</HI>, by the ingenious Author of the <HI>Malayan</HI> Grammar and Dictionary <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Captain <HI>Bowry</HI>'s Map of <HI>Formosa</HI>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Occasion of this <HI>Emporium</HI>, was a Prohi∣bition of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, forbidding the <HI>Japponese</HI> to come to <HI>China</HI>, and the <HI>Chinese</HI> to go to <HI>Japan</HI>, upon which both by consent to ward off the Severity of the Edict found out a Third place, namely <HI>Tayavan</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Erat tunc temporis in China multi Japponii —hi totam ali∣quam urbem dev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>starunt — Caesar Chinae — Itaque — omnes Jap∣ponenses regno suo ejecit &amp; in perpetuum abstinere illo Jussit — Edictum quoque promulgavit sub poenâ mortis ne quis Chinensium in Japponiam navigaret — Exclusi ex China Japponenses instituerunt navigationes ad <HI>Tayavan</HI> ubi a Chinensibus merces accipiebant su∣isque permutabunt — sed Caesar Chinae Re comperta prohibuit sub∣ditis suis illuc loci ire. <HI>Vareni descript Japon. C. 26.</HI></NOTE> but the Emperor of <HI>China</HI>, as soon as he knew of this, forbid his People to go thither, and put an end to the Trade upon that place.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether the former Trade or the Conveni∣ency of the place invited the <HI>Dutch</HI>, certain it is hither they came, and at the Mouth of the Har∣bour built a Fort, named it new <HI>New Zealand</HI> upon <HI>Tayavan</HI>, and as some say, had a considera∣ble Town upon the Island of the same Name <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Moreri, Grand Diction. Historic. voc Formosa. Theovan (la Principal Vil) &amp; le fort de Zealand sunt Batis sur une petite Isle — elonge de l'Isle of Formosa de une bon quart de lieu.</NOTE> built by themselves, and hence they used to fur∣nish <HI>Europe</HI> with divers goods of the East, and in particular with Vessels of Silver Plate, curiously wrought in <HI>Japan</HI>, but known in <HI>Europe</HI> by the Name of <HI>Tayavan</HI> Plate.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="15"/>3. The Isle <HI>Tayavan</HI> is a small Island, and tho' convenient for Trade yet good for little else. And it was by leave from the <HI>Chinese</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> settled there<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Letter to the Governour of <HI>Tayavan</HI> in <HI>Newhoffe</HI>'s Voyages.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Tayavan</HI> is the proper Name of this Island among the <HI>Chinese</HI> and all the <HI>Asians</HI>; but the Isle <HI>Formosa</HI> is by the <HI>Chinese</HI> call'd <HI>Paccando</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Note <SUP>b</SUP>. which proves the Name <HI>Tayavan:</HI> The Name <HI>Paccando</HI> is found in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Accounts and Maps; particularly <HI>Rechtoren, pag.</HI> 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Dutch</HI> not content with the limits of <HI>Tayavan</HI>, extend themselves beyond it, upon the Coasts of <HI>Formosa</HI>, i. e. <HI>Paccando.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. There they meet a People who differ in Language, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the rest of the People of <HI>For∣mosa</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Thus <HI>Candidius</HI>. The Manners and Customs of all the In∣habitants, I will not pretend to enlarge upon at this time, <HI>as being unknown hitherto</HI>, but will confine my self to those whose Languages I am satisfied in by Experience, being 8 Cantons, or large Villages, within 2 Days Journey of the Fort. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Original adds, <HI>i. e.</HI> you may go and return in two Days.</NOTE>. And these they call <HI>Side is Formosaanche</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pakar &amp;c. Ost. Formulier des Christiendoms</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>Inde sideis Formosaanscho Tale.</HI> By <HI>Grevius</HI>. Printed by Mr. <HI>Hartogh</HI> at <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> 1662. Epistle to the Reader, and in the Title.</NOTE>, and we shall hence call <HI>Coasters</HI>. And these had eight Cantons or Towns upon the Coasts, cal∣led <HI>Sincan, Mandauw, Soulang Backeloang, Taffucan, Tiffulucan, Teopang</HI>, and <HI>Teffurang</HI>; all within one Days Journey of the Fort, save the last, which was one Day and half's Journey <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Candidius <HI>and</HI> Grevius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Isle of <HI>Formosa</HI> is situated from 21 De∣grees 20 Minutes, to 25 Degrees 10 Minutes, North Lat. which is 3 Degrees 50 Minutes, and amounts to 230 Miles in length, if it lay direct North and South, whereas the declining makes it
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
more. So that these <HI>Coasters</HI> of <HI>Sincan, &amp;c.</HI> had but a small part of the whole, and seem to be the old Inhabitants drawn to the Sea-side by some Invaders, as the <HI>Welsh</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors. And therefore to bring the Matter to some Certainty, and that our Inquiry may be put to an end, we think we may lay down this Rule by which to guide our selves, namely,</P>
<P><HI>That since these</HI> Sideis Formosaansche, <HI>these Coasters of</HI> Formosa <HI>are by</HI> Candidius <HI>distinguish'd from the other People of</HI> Formosa, <HI>and have no Correspondence with them; and since we do not yet know those other People who are the principal and greatest part of the Inhabitants of the Isle</HI>. Therefore, <HI>such Accounts as relate only to those Coasters do not contradict</HI> Ps—r, <HI>who describes the other parts of the Isle, and the principal Inha∣bitants thereof</HI>.</P>
<P>So that here's a Rule, by which any En∣quiry for the future, may be directed. <HI>Do you speak of the People whom the</HI> Dutch <HI>had to do with when they were settled upon</HI> Tayavan, <HI>or of the whole Island?</HI> If <HI>the former</HI>, then <HI>Ps—r</HI> may be right; for no Accounts of them do at all interfere with his. And we have now no occa∣sion to go after this or the other Gentleman that has been in <HI>East-India</HI>, or heard, or read of it. Every one for himself may direct his own Judg∣ment, and for the future prevent any Error in this Affair.</P>
<P>However, we shall ask leave to tell the Rea∣der what we farther find in the Accounts of <HI>Taya∣van</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is very remarkable, the strange Jealousie these <HI>Islanders</HI> have one of another. As an In∣stance of which take the following Story.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17"/>There is a small Island, called by the Dutch <HI>the golden Lyon Island</HI>, but by the <HI>Asians Tugin</HI>; it lyes upon that side of <HI>Formosa</HI> next <HI>China</HI>, South from <HI>Tayavan</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tabula Asiae Orientalis emendata per F. De. Witt.</NOTE>.
<Q>“The People maintain'd conti∣nual War with the Dutch, and were so jealous of Strangers as not to suffer them to set Foot on Shore. They have some Traffick with the <HI>Chinese</HI>, who don't come ashore, but remain in small Vessels, the Islanders come out to 'em in Boats, and take with the right hand what they are to have, while they give with the left their Portion to the <HI>Chinese</HI>, and are sure not to let go their hold before they are satisfy'd ”in the other <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Candidius.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. It is farther remarkable, that those People were not under <HI>China</HI> at this time, <HI>viz.</HI> 1630. And hence one would be tempted to think the <HI>Formosans</HI> were not then Tributaries to <HI>China</HI>. If such a small Island could maintain its own Sove∣reignty, much more <HI>Formosa</HI>; and if <HI>Formosa</HI> had then been under <HI>China</HI>, could <HI>Tugin</HI>, a small Island between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI>, and so near to the latter, remain unconquer'd?</P>
<P N="10">10. It is yet farther remarkable, that the <HI>Dutch, Anno</HI> 1630. had not this small Isle <HI>Tugin</HI> under their Jurisdiction, and that the Coasters, <HI>Formo∣sans</HI>, had it not under theirs; for thus the Story goes on,</P>
<P><Q>“Not long ago, about 60 Men belonging to <HI>Soulang</HI> sailed thither disguised like <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants—whereupon some of the Islanders coming out, they (the <HI>Soulang</HI> Men) took hold of the Arm of one of 'em, as he was stretching
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
it out to lay hold of what was offered him, and forced him into their Vessel, cut him in pie∣ces, brought him home as a Token of a most signal Victory<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Candid. ubi. supra.</NOTE>; and he had said before that these <HI>Tuginers</HI> were in a continual War with ”the <HI>Dutch</HI>.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. And we think we may conclude from them, that since the Coasters of <HI>Formosa</HI> and the Natives of <HI>Tugin</HI> are thus at Enmity, there may be the same between the principal <HI>Formosans</HI> and these Coasters; and that since the <HI>Dutch</HI> could not get this small Island, much less the great Island of <HI>Formosa</HI>, tho' they had the Coasters to help them.</P>
<P N="12">12. And accordingly we find one <HI>Junius</HI> ma∣king great Conversions upon <HI>Formosa, Anno</HI> 1640. But it was among the People of <HI>Sincan</HI>, and the other Towns named by <HI>Candidius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The Account in <HI>English</HI> by <HI>H. Jesse. Lond.</HI> 1650.</NOTE>. So that the principal Inhabitants are left unconverted and unknown.</P>
<P N="13">13. And when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were driven from <HI>For∣mosa</HI> by <HI>Coxinga</HI>, it is plain, <HI>Coxinga</HI> sudued at that time no more than the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Account of this in <HI>Baldeus, apud Churchil</HI>. Vol. 3. Pag. 633.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is an odd Story told of this Business of <HI>Coxinga</HI> by more Authors than one, as if he made <HI>Formosa</HI> his Refuge, when he was driven out of <HI>China</HI> by the <HI>Tartar</HI>; and if it were so, then <HI>For∣mosa</HI> must be under <HI>China</HI> then and since. But this Story seems told on purpose to hide a Suspi∣cion of some ill Practices of the <HI>Dutch</HI>, for the Fact was thus; at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19"/><HI>Coxinga</HI> had sent two Ships of Money from the South Part of <HI>China</HI> by Sea, to pay his Taxes in the North; these Ships were intercepted, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> of <HI>Tayavan</HI> had or were suspected to have had a Hand in the Business. Upon this <HI>Coxinga</HI> draws down a mighty Force to the Isles of <HI>Ey</HI> and <HI>Quemoy</HI>, over against <HI>Tayavan</HI>. This gives Umbrage to the Governour of <HI>Tayavan</HI>, he obtains a Squadron of Men of War from <HI>Batavia</HI>, and sends an Envoy <HI>(John Newhoffe)</HI> to <HI>Coxinga</HI> to know his Design in his Preparations.</P>
<P><HI>Coxinga</HI> amuses 'em with a Letter sent to the Go∣vernour, upon which he sends back the Squadron, and then <HI>Coxinga</HI> routed 'em from <HI>Tayavan</HI>, and from <HI>Sincan</HI>, and also <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>
<P>Now this was the Occasion of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s expel∣ling the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and not that he might make his retreat thither.</P>
<P>He could not then think of such a Place as <HI>Tayavan</HI> to retreat to, he calls it in his Letter <HI>An inconsi∣derable Island that produces nothing but Grass</HI>, a Character agreeing with it but not with <HI>Formosa</HI>, which it's plain he never aimed at <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Newhoffe</HI>'s Voyages <HI>apud Churchill</HI>. Vol. 2. P. 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now one would admire that all our People of <HI>Europe</HI> should not mind the Difference so plain∣ly express'd by <HI>Candidius</HI>, and observed by all the Authors since; but it seems the <HI>Dutch</HI> had named <HI>Tayavan Formosa</HI>, and so it must be called. But for our Parts, unless the modern <HI>Formosa</HI> extend it self farther than that of <HI>Candidius</HI>, we are still, as we think, just where we were, when we part∣ed with that honest Gentleman.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is many Years since the <HI>English</HI> had a sort of a Factory upon <HI>Tayavan</HI>, but our Com∣merce extended not so far as the <HI>Dutch</HI>, not far
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
enough upon the main Island of <HI>Formosa</HI> to disco∣ver any Rivers; which yet, one would think, might have been discover'd without going far up the Country. We have an Account of this Factory of ours in the two following Letters from a Gen∣tleman who has been there.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who wrote 'em express'd no Desire to have 'em kept private, and he who re∣ceiv'd 'em, shew'd 'em to any body, and they are all already as publick as they well can be, even by this our putting 'em in print. For that Reason, and because these Letters have occasion'd great Mistakes about <HI>Formosa</HI>, for want of the Di∣stinction aforesaid, it is necessary the World should see 'em. They have occasion'd mighty Sus∣picion about <HI>Ps—r</HI>, and should they be now corrected, our Enquiry could not be made about the Reasons of the Suspicions hence occasion'd. Therefore we hope we may be pardon'd, though we cannot suppose he intended 'em for the Pub∣lick, yet it was absolutely necessary to make 'em publick; and we durst not ask leave, lest he should insist to correct 'em.</P>
<P>And because they are thus publish'd without leave, we thought our selves obliged to omit the Names, but they who have heard of any Letters sent from <HI>Suffolk</HI> about <HI>Formosa</HI> may be assur'd these are the Letters; and indeed these are all the Letters, that we can learn, ever were sent from any one in <HI>England</HI> to any one in <HI>London</HI> a∣bout <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>

The <HI>Portuguese</HI>, while trading in <HI>Japan</HI>, had a Residence. The <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> ferretted 'em out, had there so good a Settlement, that the Government of the Island was reputed next to <HI>Batavia. Coxinga</HI> a <HI>Chinese Algerine</HI> about 1660 got the place from the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and now it belongs to the Emperor of <HI>China</HI>. He might as well have given the Island to the Grand Signior or Great Mogul, as to the Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI> who has no Navy, nor suffers any of his Subjects to visit Foreign parts. (5) In 1673. A <HI>Japan</HI> Fisher or Rice Boat drove a shore on <HI>Formosa</HI>, the <HI>Chineses</HI> hearing there∣of procured the <HI>Japanners</HI> for some Linnen, carried 'em home in their Joncks next Monsoon, which Care and Kindness was so well taken at <HI>Japan</HI>, that they had not only Thanks, but procured a Settlement of their Commerce which Year preceeding was in a manner ”interdicted.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“IN answer to your Queries of the 29<HI>th</HI> past to the best of my Remembrance. The Dimension, (suppose Circumference) of the Isle <HI>Formosa</HI>, I am not able to ascertain. It is com∣monly reputed large. <HI>Francoy</HI> of Southermost Land is very high to be seen. I have heard Mariners say 40 or 50 Leagues of in about 23 Degrees. <HI>Keylong</HI> the North part in about 27. The Soil Clay, but more Sand, which is the Reason that the frequent Earth-quakes finding the Ground porous do not the Damage as in other places. It is very mountanous midland to the Eastward. I believe no Christians trade with the <HI>Formosans</HI>, neither heard of any Prohibition. (9) The Habits of what I have seen is meer Para∣dice, some, I hear, wear a Linnen Clout, or some Skin; as for Bears and other <HI>ferae naturae</HI>, I re∣member no Discourses. This I am satisfied of, that no Island abounds more with Deer, which at a Season, the piratical <HI>Chinese</HI>, that were Masters of the place, hunt, with the help of the <HI>Formosans</HI>, killing, as themselves have said 10000: The Flesh is cut into pieces salted and dried in the Sun, and is called <HI>Loeba</HI>, that is Deer's Flesh, serves them at Sea in their Voy∣ages. The Skins are carefully dried, and a sta¦ple Commodity at <HI>Japan</HI>. I have not heard of any Coins the <HI>Formosans</HI> have. Some Bars not many, I have seen of twenty three Carats but no other Mettal. The Produce is Sugar in Quantities, as well, (I think better) grain'd than <HI>Brazile</HI>. Sugar Candy white and brown
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
which goes for <HI>Japan</HI> with the Deers Skins. Whether <HI>Snakes and Raw Flesh are eaten</HI>; I can neither affirm nor deny; that there are large and deadly Snakes have heard. Their Complexion pure Olive: No doubt of their smoaking, nor Scarcity of Tobacco, it growing wild. They are so far, I am of Opinion, from any Lectures in Greek or Latin, that I question whether any <HI>Formosan</HI> knows what either word means, never heard of any thing, like <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan</HI> Ware made there. As to their Characters I can say nothing, nor what Island is between <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI>, I have never heard of any conside∣rable. Believe neither Pepper nor any Spice grows there, unless I include Ginger, Turme∣ric, Potatoes, Beetle, Nut and Areca. I have seen several <HI>Chinese</HI> Criminals crucified. I came to <HI>Formosa</HI> in 1672. (10) Made two or three Trips to <HI>Emoy</HI>, thence arrived 1677. at <HI>Ban∣tam</HI>, and sailed from <HI>Batavia</HI> 1682. for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> 1684. went for <HI>Bengal</HI>, and returned home ”about the Revolution.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>These are the Letters which we hope we have Liberty to read over again, and make two Observa∣tions upon 'em.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>, We think they do not contradict <HI>P—r</HI>'s Account.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, We think they partly confirm it.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>, The <HI>Emporium</HI> is <HI>Tyavan</HI>, the then Fa∣ctory of the English, (n<SUP>o</SUP> (2) (10). The extent or rather Confinement of our Merchants upon that Factory, not admitting the Knowlege of any Rivers (n<SUP>o</SUP> (3) nor Towns (n<SUP>o</SUP> (4) shews that
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
we did not go so far upon the main Island of <HI>For∣mosa</HI>, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> heretofore, who had Com∣merce in eight Towns, and were restrained by the same Bounds as <HI>the Coasters</HI> themselves. The Name by which the <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants call this Place <HI>Sonvenchou</HI>, is either <HI>Chinese</HI> or <HI>Malayan</HI>, if the first, then it must mean the part of <HI>Formosa</HI> belonging to the <HI>Coasters</HI> for we have already proved the <HI>Chinese</HI> call the whole Island <HI>Paccando</HI>. But if the word be <HI>Mallayan</HI>, as we rather con∣clude, because they call the People by a <HI>Mallayan</HI> Name (n<SUP>o</SUP> 6) then we are to seek whether they mean <HI>Tayavan</HI> or <HI>Formosa</HI>. For the <HI>Mallayan</HI> is a sort of <HI>Lingua Franca</HI>, a Language made by Agreement of the trading People of the East. And then we may conclude <HI>Sonvenchew</HI> to be the Name of the <HI>Emporium</HI>, and that is <HI>Tayavan</HI> says our Author of these Letters (n<SUP>o</SUP> (2). And the Rea∣son this Gentleman gives that <HI>Formosa</HI> does not belong to <HI>Japan</HI>, because the <HI>Japonese</HI> have no Navy, and the Subjects don't go abroad, (n<SUP>o</SUP> (5) we think shews his small Knowledge of the true Governours thereof. Had he certainly known the <HI>Chinese</HI> have the whole, he need not have added this Reason, which we think no Argument, be∣cause the <HI>Japonese</HI> Emperor must have a Navy sufficient to manage his own Empire, that being made up of many Islands, and he may send this Navy out, so that we think these Letters contain¦ing an Account of <HI>Tayavan</HI> does not contradict <HI>Ps—r</HI>'s Account of <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, Some things in these Letters we judge confirm his Account. Such is the Character of <HI>Formosa</HI>, that it is a large and plentiful Island (n<SUP>o</SUP> (1) And therefore could not be <HI>the Place whence</HI> Coxinga <HI>expelled the</HI> Dutch, for that was <HI>Tayavan a barren Island bearing nothing but Grass</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">In my Father's Days you settled upon <HI>Tayavan</HI> by his Con∣sent. I have had no leisure to trouble my self with an incon∣siderate Island that produces nothing but Grass. <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Let∣ter to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour of <HI>Tayavan. apud Niewhoffe</HI>, in <HI>Churchil</HI>'s Collection. Vol. 2. <HI>anno</HI> 59. just before he drove 'em out.</NOTE> <HI>a meer spit of Sand</HI>. (n<SUP>o</SUP> (2) Again from the Account this Gentleman gives of the Govern∣ment of <HI>Formosa</HI>. (n<SUP>o</SUP> (8) <HI>That they have Princi∣palities at utter enmity with each other</HI>, shews that the poor Coasters, being Subject to <HI>China</HI>, have made 'em odious to the principal Inhabitants, from whom they differ in Language, and Customs, and Religion. And by the Christians not trading with the principal Inhabitants, (n<SUP>o</SUP> 9) we con∣clude they must belong to <HI>Japan</HI>, with whom no Christians trade, save the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon Terms not very Christian.</P>
<P N="15">15. And tho' this our <HI>English</HI> Factory be not now at <HI>Tayavan</HI>, yet still all that talk of <HI>Formosa</HI> in the East, understand <HI>Tayavan</HI>. And this we think led a Reverend Divine of <HI>Oxford</HI> lately come from thence into the vulgar Error, tho' he had a Desire to be satisfied. This Gentleman's Chara∣cter needs no Illustration from us; no body can say he wants either Ability to enquire, or Sinceri∣ty to relate his Discovery, but if he had not full Instructions, his Enquiry may be defective, and his Discovery short of the matter: And we hum∣bly think he had not full Instructions in this Af∣fair; certain it is the Answer he received goes no farther than <HI>Tayavan</HI> and <HI>the Coasts of Formosa</HI>. The <HI>Formosa</HI> of <HI>Candidius</HI>, and of all us <HI>Europeans</HI>. This appears from the <HI>Formosan Book</HI> he brought from <HI>Bataavia</HI>, which he is pleased to allow is <HI>the Language of that</HI> Formosa <HI>he tells us of</HI>. Now this Book is a Catechism mentioned already,
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
made by one <HI>Grevius</HI>, and printed at <HI>Amsterdam, Anno</HI> 1662. it seems the News of the Expulsion of the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not then reacht <HI>Europe</HI>. And in the Epistle prefixt to this very Book, the Au∣thor <HI>Grevius</HI> says, it is the Language of the People of <HI>Sincan</HI>, and the other seven Towns, named by <HI>Candidius</HI>; so that the People must be the same, which <HI>Candidius</HI> speaks of, and we are just where we were before this Enquiry.</P>
<P>It may be well wondred at, that none of the Curious should note this Difference in which <HI>Can∣didius</HI> is so express, which it is plain they did not, for then the Enquiry would have been about that other People, to whom <HI>Candidius</HI> affirms himself a Stranger, and which we conclude may be <HI>the People whom</HI> P—r <HI>has described</HI>, and therefore his History of <HI>Formosa</HI> may be true.</P>
<P>And we conclude it actually true from two Rea∣sons, which we judge sufficient.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st</HI>, The Authority of the Historian.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly</HI>, The concurring Testimony of <HI>Lubomirski</HI>.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>First</HI>, We hope this will not be called begging the Question, the Objections being made against him from the Improbabilities of his Book. Now every Man has a Right to be believed in his Asser∣tions, if he has (1) Ability to be informed, (2) Integrity to tell the Truth, and (3) asserts nothing contrary to right Reason. That <HI>P—r</HI> has <HI>the first</HI>, we believe will be allowed, if we consider his natural Endowments, and admit he came from thence, That he has <HI>the second</HI>, we think may be proved from his being <HI>a Christian</HI>, converted by Arguments, which must convince a∣ny one who considers 'em, and which we find he has consider'd by his repeating 'em upon all Occa∣sions; and one who leads a Christian Life which cannot be accounted for, without allowing the
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
Precepts of our Religion to have subdued his Will, as the Doctrines have convinc'd his understanding. And 3<HI>dly</HI>, That he affirms nothing, which right Reason can contradict appears from his Book, as must be allowed by the most Curious, if impar∣tial Reader: And therefore, tho' we do not pro∣duce <HI>P—r</HI>'s History as an Evidence for him, yet we think <HI>Ps—r</HI> himself ought not to be objected against on account of his Book; but the Book received for his Sake who is of Ability to know as much as that contains, and honest enough to forbear imposing upon the World, and tells nothing but what may be true.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, We have a concuring Testimony. The noble Prince <HI>John Albert Lubomirski</HI>, one who has been twelve Years a Missionar in <HI>China</HI>, of the Order of the Franciscans, and during that time was three Years with one <HI>Basilius</HI> a Missionar of that Order, and now Bishop of <HI>Xanton</HI> in <HI>China</HI>. The Bishop has been there about forty Years, and during that space was upon <HI>Formosa</HI>. This <HI>Lu∣bomirski</HI> being now a Protestant, came hither upon the Recommendation of the Antistes of <HI>Zuric</HI>, a Person of good Authority well known to my Lord of <HI>London</HI>. It was as soon as he came hither, that this Account was given by him. He was no way led into any Particulars of it. The Conversation was managed by one Mr. <HI>B.</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, one that had no Opinion of <HI>Ps—r</HI> till he heard what <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> affirmed of <HI>Formo∣sa</HI>. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was to wait upon him by Order from a Gentleman beyond Sea; and as soon as he had declared the Occasion of his coming, postponed his own Business, and inquired whether <HI>Lubomir∣ski</HI> knew <HI>Formosa?</HI> when he heard he knew the place, he asked farther, whether he had been upon it? but finding he had not, he enquir'd the
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
Reason —<HI>Lubomirsky</HI> said it was because <HI>Formosa</HI> was not under <HI>China</HI>, but under <HI>Japan</HI>, and by the Laws of <HI>Japan</HI>; no Christian may come thi∣ther on pain of Death. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was surprized to hear this, but <HI>Lubomirski</HI> affirmed it, and went on to tell several things more; agreeing with <HI>Ps—r</HI> in all he said.</P>
<P>Upon which he was desired to give us these Par∣ticulars in Writing, which he promised, and after∣wards in part performed. He writ in Latin, but we have put it into <HI>English</HI>, and left the Latin Copy at the Booksellers for any one to compare our Ver∣sion with it. <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> had not seen <HI>Ps—r</HI> when he told us the Particulars, that induced us to desire his writing 'em. And tho' indeed he did see him before he gave us the Paper, yet the Dif∣ferences between his and <HI>Ps—r</HI>'s Account are sufficient to shew they had no Combination.</P>
<P>We wish <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> had made good the Character given him by the Antistes of <HI>Zuric</HI>, for he pretended to him that he would go back to convert the Popish <HI>Chinese</HI> to the Pro∣testant Religion, which he has now made impra∣cticable by his Marriage; but still he is as we think, a credible Witness in this Case. He had no manner of suggestions to tell a Lye; he was desired to say the truth; he has since adhered to his Testimony, tho' he has had Temptation to sneak out of it, and whilst he was in Town, had no manner of Promises from any of us to induce his standing to it. And we are content any Body, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they can, should induce him to retract it, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we will not rely upon it. And therefore tho' w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should admit him lapsed into Faults, not consi¦stent with his Character, does that weaken thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Testimony? at this rate, what Causes can be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed till the Day of Judgment?

<HEAD>A short <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of the Isle <HI>FORMOSA</HI>.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P N="1">1. THE Isle <HI>Formosa</HI> is scituate under the Tro∣pick of <HI>Cancer</HI>, and near the Empire of <HI>China</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is about 400 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles about.</P>
<P N="3">3. The People are all Pagans.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has many Kings, each of which has abso∣lute Power over his own little Territory, and go∣verns it by his own Laws.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="22" REF="31"/>5. And these Kings are at continual Wars, and sell the Captives they take.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are People black and olive Colour. The black are those who live above Ground, go na¦ked, and have little Houses one Story high. They who dwell under Ground are Olive Colour. I have seen those People in <HI>China</HI> in <HI>Cantaon</HI> or <HI>Mac∣caw</HI>, where I lived three whole Years. There are no white Men in <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>
<P N="7">7. Some of the <HI>Formosans</HI> go cloathed, as the <HI>Chinese</HI>, in long Silk Cloths of divers Colours some wear their Beards long, others have no Beards.</P>
<P N="8">8. All the <HI>Formosans</HI> have long Faces, black Eyes, long black Hair. Some who live up¦on the South part have little Eyes like Moles, and are very sharp sighted.</P>
<P N="9">9. All the petty Kings wear a white Habit of fine Linnen, long as the <HI>Chinese</HI>.</P>
<P N="10">10. They all go barefoot, both Men and Wo∣men.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Island formerly belong'd to <HI>China</HI>, but now at this time it belongs to the <HI>Japponese</HI>.</P>
<P N="12">12. The People eat raw Flesh.</P>
<P N="13">13. The <HI>Formosans</HI> keep their divers Idolatrous Feasts with the greatest Solemnity, and worship divers Gods, the Moon, the Sun, the Stars, the Devil.</P>
<P>Their chief Idol is called <HI>Moloch</HI>, made of pure Gold, and placed in the middle of the City. Every Year they sacrifice Children to it very solemnly in this manner. (1) They make the Idol very hot, them (2) the Sacrificers and Soldiers for three Days toge∣ther, dance, sing, beat Drums, and play divers foolish Tricks, some about the Idol, others about the Chil∣dren to be sacrificed. (3) They wash the Children with perfumed Water made against the Feast. (4)
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
They that Day dress the Children in very rich cloaths, set out with Gold and Jewels, and put 'em into a triumphal Chariot. Some of the Sacrificers and Soldiers are placed about this Chariot, and weep bitterly, and make lamentable Moan, others sing before the Chariot, others follow it with the Mul∣titude drumming, playing upon Cymbals, and Trum∣pets, and upon Trumpets six Cubits long. When they come to the Idol, and have finish'd their Rites, the Chief Priest takes the Infants out of the Cha∣riot, and puts 'em into the burning Idol, which immediately consumes 'em. And to prevent their Parents and Kindred from hearing their Cries, Some beat Drums, others sing, some dance, others cry and play foolish Tricks.</P>
<P N="14">14. Some of the <HI>Formosans</HI> speak the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language very well; especially, they who have Dealings with the <HI>Chinese</HI>.</P>
<P N="15">15. They have divers Characters and Letters; some write like the Hebrews, some like the <HI>Jap∣ponese</HI>, some like the <HI>Chinese</HI>. I have often seen their Characters.</P>
<P N="16">16. They have a Feast sacred to the Goat; in which all the Soldiers cloathed and armed go in Procession thro' the Cities, and Towns, and Tem∣ples; they take with 'em Goats according to the bigness of the City, sometimes two, sometimes three thousand; these they sacrifice in the publick Street: When they come to the chief Temple of the City, the Blood they receive in a large Bason. The manner of the Sacrifice is thus, One of the Priests holds him by the Head, another by the Tail, and a third cuts off his Head with a Sword; the Flesh they distribute among themselves, and eat it raw with great Devotion; then with the Blood they sprinkle their Weapons, their Houses, Temples, and City-Walls; and are persuaded
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
that hereby they appease their God, to wit, the Sun, to whom this Sacrifice is made; and think he will for the future, not only not hurt 'em, but keep 'em from all Evil.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>They eat Bread made not of Wheat, but only of Rice, and of the Roots of Trees.</HI></P>

<P N="20">20. They let two of their Finger-Nails grow upon each Hand, which serve for a Comb; this I have seen in <HI>Maccaw</HI>.</P>
<P N="21">21. They keep a Feast in the new Moon of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI>, called in the <HI>Chinese Telmelsamu</HI>, on which they go in Procession to the Sea, and wash them∣selves, and then go to the chief Temple, in which there is an Idol to which they go down by Stairs; when they are come to the last Stair the Priest and People stand there some time singing before the Idol, and about the Sacrifice, which is a Com∣pany of Men freely offering themselves. Each of whose Breasts the Chief Priest at one Blow cleaves asunder, and pulls out his Heart, fresh, and yet alive; then the Corps are carried out with great Solemnity to a Place for that Purpose, where they are burnt with divers superstitious Ceremo∣nies, and the Persons thus offered are reputed Saints. This Sacrifice they celebrate Yearly.</P>
<P>These things about the Isle <HI>Formosa</HI> I have heard to be very true. My Author is <HI>Pater Basili∣us</HI>, of <HI>Cremona</HI>, a Missionary who has now been 40 Years in <HI>China</HI> and the Isles adjacent, and is now B<SUP>p</SUP>. of <HI>Xanton</HI>; I was with him three Years
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
in <HI>Maccaw</HI>, he lives a holy Life, and was 3 Years in <HI>Formosa</HI>, he affirmed he saw what I had from him; I often heard him say what I have written. He deserves Credit, and is much esteemed by the <HI>Chinese</HI> for his Probity and Learning, and is of the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Order as I was.</P>

<P>Thus his Account of <HI>Formosa</HI>, the Certificate he gave to the Characters is as follows, <HI>tales, &amp;c.</HI> which we thus render.</P>

<P>All we add is, that it was purely contingent that we had the Certificate about the Characters used there. The Person who waited upon him for the Account had then that Writing about him; and while there, it came into his Mind to ask the Cer∣tificate upon it and had it. And <HI>Lu—ski</HI> has since affirmed that he knows the Characters, as having seen 'em written; and also, as having seen a <HI>Formosan</HI> Book at Bp. <HI>Basilius</HI>'s, wrote in that Character.</P>
<P>And now we leave it with the impartial Rea∣der, whether <HI>Ps—r</HI>'s Account of <HI>Formosa</HI> be not true? since it may be true notwithstanding any Account of ours; and is true both if we ad∣mit him to be a Christian, and also if <HI>Lubomirski</HI> be a credible Witness.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR History of <HI>Formosa</HI> has mett with great Varietie, as to the Opinion wich the World has of it. Some look upon it as a Ro∣mance, in <HI>wich</HI> the Bookseller bears no small Part.

<P>You are desired to take notice of the Rule de∣livered, Page 46, <HI>Those are not a true Church, who seperate</HI> themselfs <HI>from that, or those Socie∣ties of Christians in whom the Power of admini∣string the Sacraments, and other sacred Ordinances is only lodged</HI>. Upon <HI>wich</HI> it is demanded, who lay'd Hands upon the first Reformers of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Church? If no body, they want a lawfull Mission. If the Papists, (as they all agree) why did they separate <HI>themselfs</HI> from that Societie of Christians in whom the Power of administring was certainly lodged? that is, why did they se∣parate <HI>themselfs</HI> from the Papists?</P>
<P>These, amongst many others, are the Excepti∣ons which I have frequently heard alledged against your Book, wich unless you give some Satisfacti∣on to, neither your History, nor Motives of your Conversion will pass amongst our Nothern Cri∣ticks, who have not the Opportunity of a Perso∣nal Conference with you.</P>
<P>Now, tho' we think this Paper answers it self in great part, yet since all Readers will not take the Pains to consider every thing, in Affairs so purely speculative as this is to most People, we think some short Remarks may be of use, for ful∣ler Information, and therefore we reply,</P>
<P>To the Introduction.</P>
<P>If by <HI>bearing no small part</HI> be meant, that <HI>Ps—r</HI> wrote his Book at the Bookseller's Direction, and by their Inundoes, the contrary can be pro∣ved
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
by many, who saw his <HI>Latin</HI> Copy before he had disposed of it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 1.</HEAD>
<P>The Querist either believes <HI>Ps—r</HI> or not; if the first, <HI>Ps—r</HI> has affirm'd the contrary already; if the latter, why does he ask him any Question at all?</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 2.</HEAD>
<P>We do not think this Question at all to the Purpose, but rather against the Querist; for if it was no Rarity to convert a <HI>Japponese</HI> to our Church, then the Wonder about <HI>Ps— r</HI> ceases.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 3.</HEAD>
<P>The Reader will recollect that <HI>Ps—r</HI> learnt the Latin Tongue at <HI>Formosa</HI> for <HI>Practice</HI>, and the Reason of the thing tells us, he must learn it by having the natural and politick History of his own Country taught him in Latin, for his Tutor did not bring Books with him.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 4.</HEAD>
<P>This Query is answer'd by <HI>Ps—r</HI> in his se∣cond Preface to his second Edition of his History of <HI>Formosa</HI>, Object. 1.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 5.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Varenius</HI> tells their Names, and how many there were, namely, (1) <HI>Cosmus Torrianus</HI>, and (2) <HI>Johannes Fernandus</HI>, both <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>; (3) <HI>Angor</HI>, and (4) (5) his 2 Servants, all 3 <HI>Japponese</HI> (but converted) five in the whole. <HI>Varen.</HI> Descr. <HI>Japan</HI> Cap. 5.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 6.</HEAD>
<P>Here by [Why] we ask leave to understand [Whether], for thus we find the same Word used afterwards, Query 10, and the best Interpretati∣on of the Querist's Intention seems to require in this Place. And then we think we may answer af∣firmatively.
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
And as to your sly Insinuation, that <HI>we allow the Roman to be a saving Church</HI>, you are not advantaged thereby, for we allow it with such a Distinction as will much better serve the poor <HI>Pagans</HI> of <HI>Formosa</HI>, than any Papist in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>. See Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> against <HI>Fisher</HI>.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 7.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Ps—r</HI> has answer'd you already in the afore∣said second Preface, Obj. 19.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 8.</HEAD>
<P>We suppose the Querist mistakes the Page, we have examin'd both Editions, and find no such Af∣firmation, Page 15, in either. We believe indeed he may refer to Page 42 of the first, or Page 214 of the second Edition; in which it plainly appears, that to be govern'd by Bishops is an essential Part of the Constitution of the Christian Church; and <HI>Ps—r</HI> had given sufficient Reasons before, why he could not joyn with any other Church, tho' Episcopal, but that of <HI>England</HI>. He speaks for himself, let others answer for themselves.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 9.</HEAD>
<P>We think, very easily. Because they baptized in Latin, and taught a Creed, such as they plea∣sed; for which we refer to the Gospel composed by <HI>Hieronymus Xavier</HI> for the Mogul at <HI>Agra</HI>, mentioned by my Lord of <HI>Chichester</HI> in his Sermon to our Society <HI>de promov<SUP>o</SUP>. Evang<SUP>o</SUP></HI>. But admit they taught the very Creed of the Apostles, they might as well expound away the Misteries as they do the very express Commands against Idolatry, and as our <HI>Socinians</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> do the Misteries we are speaking of.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 10.</HEAD>
<P>We cannot think this Query at all to the Pur∣pose, because all we are to enquire about is, whe∣ther <HI>Ps—r</HI> has made a true Report of the An∣nals
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
he pretends to quote. But whether those Annals be true, is a Question does not affect him at all. Undoubtedly the Jesuits, who were there a great while after the Persecution began, could not but know whether it was occasion'd by any but themselves. And it is strange they have not lay'd the Fault some where else, if it was not theirs.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 11.</HEAD>
<P>As for what this Querist would insinuate <HI>that the despight shewn by the</HI> Dutch <HI>to the Cross is renouncing Christianity</HI>, we submit to proper Ca∣suists, confessing our selves not able to determine it, tho' abhorring the Practice. But this being a modern Practice, and set up since the Laws for abolishing our Religion, we think cannot be said to be the incensing the <HI>Pagans</HI>, who were incensed before.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 12.</HEAD>
<P>If hopes of temporal Advantage would have engaged <HI>Ps—r</HI> to have quitted Paganism, he need not have exposed himself to the Jesuits Fu∣ry at <HI>Avignon</HI>, nor to the hardships he underwent before his Conversion. But to put you out of Pain, if <HI>Ps—r</HI> had any Promise made <HI>before his Conversion</HI>, and we add, <HI>or since</HI>, they who have made that Promise never kept it; and yet we assure you he has never complain'd of the Breach of any Promise, tho' he has tryal enough; and he denys any was ever made.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 13.</HEAD>
<P>If the Fact is right, it is God, and not <HI>Ps—r</HI> who thus confined it, but if the Fact be not right, Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> and they who told <HI>Ps—r</HI> so, are to blame. But let the Church History shew whether he was not well informed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
<HEAD>To Query 14.</HEAD>
<P><HI>P—r</HI> in his Book tells you no, and shews you what brought him to our particular Church, when he was convinc'd of the Truth of our Re∣ligion in general.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 15.</HEAD>
<P>The Definitions, Postulata, Axioms and Propo∣sitions, pag. the 42. of the first Edition, and pag. 214. of the 2<HI>d.</HI> are so plain, that they need no such Application. If the Roman Church denys any but the twentieth; she denies her own being a Church, and we are at any time ready to prove the twentieth. If you please to let us hear from you again, which you would have applied besides; you shall be immediately dispatcht.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 16.</HEAD>
<P><HI>P—r</HI> tells you he means <HI>Reason lodged in every Man</HI>, and we judge he is Right, because we find in something belonging to this Case, the com∣mon Reason of Men appealed to by a greater than <HI>P—r. I speak as to wise Men (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> prudentibus</HI>, says your vulgar Bible) <HI>Judge ye what I say</HI>, 1 Cor. 18.14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 17.</HEAD>
<P>We heartily wish the Querists had favour'd us with the Page, where the words are that give Oc∣casion to this Query. We suppose it taken from pag. 17, 125 of <HI>P—r</HI>'s Account of his Conversion, where he argues against Transubstantiation from the Inconsistency it has to the Evidence of the Senses, which if the Querist please to consult he'll be of <HI>P—r</HI>'s Opinion in that case, and if he be faithful to his own Convictions he'll be ready to affirm. (1) That the Testimony of our Senses are creditable. (2) That they bear Witness against Transubstantiation.</P>
<P>But we think God alone the Judge of any Man's
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
Belief, because he alone knows the Heart <HI>with which we believe</HI>, tho' others may judge of our Profession.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 18.</HEAD>
<P>We reply by another Query, as merry as our Querists; but such a one as will inable him to an∣swer himself, if he pleases to answer us. <HI>What business is there for Greek in any of our Schools, since 'tis now a dead Language, not spoken by Merchants?</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 19.</HEAD>
<P>This Query also is Forreign to your purpose. For <HI>P—r</HI> was converted before he came to <HI>London</HI>. But however, if you'll admit <HI>P—r</HI> as an Evidence in this we are so well satisfied of being right, even in these your Marks of true Christianity, that we are ready to join Issue with you upon it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>To Query 20.</HEAD>
<P>If they who give the Cause of Separation be the Separatists, then we think it proved over and over by our Writers, that the Papists separate from us and not we from them. Tho' to speak properly, the Church of <HI>England</HI> did not make any Separa∣tion at all. She only Reformed, as she both might and ought. But, indeed, the <HI>English</HI> Papists are Separatists to all intents, they separate from their own Bishops, with whom they ought to commu∣nicate, and to whom it is their undoubted Duty to pay canonical Obedience, and yet they make this Seperation at the Command of a Bishop, who has no Authority over 'em at all. Thus having dispatcht the Queries we hope.</P>
<P>The Conclusion of all will be that your Criticks will both be satisfied that <HI>P—r</HI> is a <HI>Formosan</HI>, and a true Convert to that Church, to which it is <HI>your and their</HI> indispensable Duty faithfully to
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
join your selves; which pray God you may do for your own Sakes, before Death makes it too late.</P>
<P>Thus having disposed of this Squadron of Ob∣jections, we are at leasure to meet the rest, which are most of 'em single, and therefore for the Rea∣ders greater satisfaction we shall put 'em in the Order of <HI>P—r</HI>'s History as it came out in the second Edition.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been urged, that Pere Fountenay, <HI>when in</HI> London, <HI>affirmed</HI> Formosa <HI>to be under</HI> China, <HI>and that he saw in</HI> China <HI>a</HI> Mandarin <HI>go∣ing thither</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We admit this, as to <HI>Tayavan</HI>, which <HI>Pere Fountenay</HI> says, was the Isle he meant. But this we have proved to be distinct from our <HI>For∣mosa</HI>, which the <HI>Chinese</HI> call <HI>Paccando</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some say <HI>the Habits P—r</HI> gives us are all a Fiction, and such as the Stage Players use, and taken thence. Others that <HI>the Crosses upon the bottom of the Queen's Petticoat</HI>, are a mark of the Papist in <HI>P—r</HI>, and if not yet more inconsi∣stent with that Abhorrence of the Cross he tells us of in <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> When we inquired about this, <HI>P—r</HI> tells us he gave only general Directions to the Engra∣ver, who added some Ornaments to the Habits; and those Crosses in particular of his own accord, and that he had put one of the Ladies a Cross of Diamonds upon her Breast, but <HI>P—r</HI> made it be put out, tho' it seems these were not mended by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have been told <HI>the Revenue of the Angon or King of</HI> Formosa, is incredible, being 400000 Copans, each weighing one Pound of Gold.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. Ps—r</HI> in this very Book tells us, that a Copan, tho' of that weight is but of 30<HI>s.</HI> Value, and then the Revenue pay'd by the Emperour of <HI>Japan</HI> to this his Deputy of <HI>Formosa</HI>, is but
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
600000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI>. And the Depu∣ty maintains the Army of 15000 Soldiers, and pays the General 105000 <HI>per Annum</HI> out of it. Neither is this great Salary any Charge to <HI>Japan</HI>, because the third part of the Mines, all the Customs, and all the Tribute of the Knognioskaas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are pay'd to the Emperor, and amount to much more.</P>
<P N="3">3. There <HI>is a Grammar of the</HI> Japan <HI>Language in Town</HI>, from whence some words have been transcrib'd and shew'd <HI>P—r</HI>, but he knew nothing of 'em, tho' he says his Language is a Dialect of the <HI>Japan</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We find the <HI>Japan</HI> Language has Dialects not very intelligible to the Natives themselves, by the Account given by <HI>Varenius</HI> of it out of <HI>Maffeus, Sermo Japponensium unus</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>There is one com∣mon Language of all</HI> Japan, <HI>but so different and manifold, that they may very well be accounted ma∣ny; there being many ways of expressing the same things. One way for contempt, another way for Respect: One way with the Court, another way with the People, one way for the Men, another way for the Women. Add, that they write one way, and speak another; and in their Writing they have one way for Letters, and another for Books, Varen. Ch.</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI> Now if this be so a Native of <HI>Japan</HI> must be spoke too in his <HI>proper Dialect</HI>, and the words must be pronounced <HI>by proper Rules</HI>, pecu∣liar to the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Method of Wri∣ting, before they can be understood by a Native. So tho' we go no farther here, we could not think this any Objection.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a <HI>Version of the Lord's Prayer</HI> in a Book extant, called <HI>the Lord's Prayer in a hundred Languages</HI>, which Book <HI>P—r</HI> refers to in his first Preface, and yet this Version is quite different from that of <HI>P—r</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="46"/><HI>Answ.</HI> We find this Version to be of the Lan∣guage of the <HI>Formosan Coasters</HI>, the People of <HI>Sinkan, &amp;c.</HI> for it agrees very much with that which <HI>Grevius</HI> has translated for those People, as may appear to any one who will be at the pains to compare 'em. And as for the Differences between 'em, it must allow'd. (1.) That the Language of these People being taken by <HI>Grevius</HI> and others from Pronunciation only, must be written by our Europeans diversely according to our different manner of Writing the same Word, when exprest by People of divers Countries, if we spell as they speak. And hence it is not probable that we spell the <HI>Formosan</HI> Words the same way. (2) It is pro∣bable that <HI>Grevius</HI> who understood both the Peo∣ple, and also the Language so very well as to be able to teach it to others, took some Pains to ren∣der the Lord's Prayer rather by way of Paraphrase and not literally. And hence it may be the Tran∣slation in his Catechism has more Words than that in the Book first mentioned. And (3.) if this be so, it was absolutely necessary to render some of the Words diversly even where we might ex∣pect the same. Thus for Instance, tho' both a∣gree in the first Sentence, using the Word [<HI>Vullum</HI>] And one of 'em afterwards uses the same Word about the Place where in <HI>English</HI> we repeat the word [<HI>Heaven</HI>], which makes us suppose the Word <HI>Vullum</HI> to signifie <HI>Heaven</HI>, yet the other does not repeat it, but has more Words than one in that place, which we take to be a Pa∣raphrase either <HI>of the place</HI> or the <HI>Inhabitants of Heaven</HI>.</P>
<P>And therefore we conclude (as some who doubt of <HI>Ps—r</HI> have done before us) that the Version of the Lord's Prayer in both Books, namely that of the Lord's Prayer in one hundred Languages, and
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
that in <HI>Grevius</HI>'s Catechism is the same Lan∣guage.</P>
<P>And we know the latter is the Language of the <HI>Formosan</HI> Coasters. The People which <HI>Candidius</HI> and all our People speak of. And therefore our Judgment of the former is this.</P>
<P>Tho' we admit this Version to be <HI>Formosan</HI>, yet it does not affect <HI>P—r</HI> any more than <HI>Welsh</HI> does <HI>the English</HI>.</P>
<P N="5">5. It has been objected that <HI>P—r</HI> has been caught once <HI>by giving a different Name to a</HI> Chinese <HI>Coin, when shewn by a different Hand</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have inquired into the matter, and find it thus.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of <HI>Chinese</HI> small Coins <HI>in∣ter alia</HI> current at <HI>Formosa</HI>, one Copper stampt but on one side, called <HI>Bingo</HI>, the other Brass stampt on both sides, called <HI>Khoudyin</HI>.</P>
<P>The Piece shew'd <HI>Ps—r</HI> has no Reverse, and yet is Brass, tho' it looks reddish like Copper, and therefore <HI>P—r</HI> now judges it to be some Copy made by our Medal Copiers.</P>
<P>When it was shew'd him the first time he judg∣ed it by the Mettal, which being, as he thought, Brass, he never examin'd the Reverse, and said it was a <HI>Khoudyin</HI>. When it was shew'd him again, he examin'd it, and thought the Impression the true way to distinguish the Mettal, which ap∣pear'd then in a full light dubious, and said it was a <HI>Bingo</HI>.</P>
<P>This we have to say, that we have other Pieces of much the same sort of <HI>Chinese</HI> Coins, but they are perfect Brass, and stampt on both sides. And we have obtained this very Piece from the Gentle∣man who first shew'd it, and it has a Cast of the Copper. We have left all with the Bookseller for farther Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="39" REF="48"/>6. It is objected there <HI>is a great deal of Greek in his Language</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We find a short Sentence of <HI>Japonese</HI> in <HI>Varenius</HI> with but six words, and one of them both sounds and signifies like Greek, <HI>Vid. Var. Ch.</HI> 1. <HI>de Relig. in Jap.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Some object there <HI>are no Islands between</HI> Ja∣pan <HI>and</HI> Formosa.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This our Map consutes, which we are sure is authentick, being what the <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany sail by. And we find many more mention'd in the Voyages in <HI>Purchas</HI>.</P>
<P N="8">8. Some will not allow any Islands betwen <HI>For∣mosa</HI> and <HI>Leuconia</HI>, and therefore <HI>P—r</HI> could not come, as he says.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> These also our Map Confutes. Besides, the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Letters tell us that the Land of <HI>For∣mosa</HI> may be seen forty or fifty Leagues off that way; so that any Mariner may go from <HI>Formosa</HI> to <HI>Leuconia</HI> by Coasting only.</P>
<P N="9">9. Others say there are Letters from <HI>Avignon</HI>, which deny his being there.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We have made the best search we can for these Letters, and cannot obtain them, tho' our Endeavours were the greater, being spurred on by a very different Account we had of 'em. We were told <HI>they affirmed his being there, and his being brought thither by</HI> Pere de Rhode. We heard from others <HI>they deny his being there at all</HI>. However, we have obtain'd an Account of 'em from the Gentleman, to whom they were sent, which take in his own Words.</P>

<LETTER>
<P><Q>“IT was about 5 Years ago, being then in <HI>Orange</HI>, I was told by a Merchant of <HI>Avignion</HI>, that there was in that City a <HI>Chinese</HI> lately arrived, who spoke Latin. I desired that Merchant, who was to go back, to contrive some way to bring him to <HI>Orange</HI>, being not a∣bove 4 Leagues off. He promised it, but at his Return sent me Word that the <HI>Chinese</HI> had withdrawn himself from thence, no body knew ”whither.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52"/>
<Q>“About two Years after [this] I was driven from <HI>Orange</HI> by the Persecution of the <HI>French</HI> King, and came to <HI>England</HI> to solicit a Colle∣ction for the Refugees of that Principality, and understood that the <HI>Chinese</HI> I heard of at <HI>Orange</HI> was then in <HI>London</HI>. I had the Curiosity to see him, <HI>and after divers Conversations which I had with him, I knew that he had effectually been at</HI> Avignion, <HI>and that he was the same Man I was told of</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Reader will please to remember this Testimony, for <HI>Ps—r</HI> is <HI>positive</HI> as to his <HI>being at</HI> Avignion, <HI>being there reputed a</HI> Chinese, <HI>and thither then lately arrived</HI>, and <HI>thence privately withdrawn</HI>. And we submit it, whether any thing but <HI>like positive and direct Proof</HI> of the contrary can invalidate this.</NOTE>. But he told me he was not a <HI>Chinese</HI> ”but a <HI>Japponese</HI>, a Native of the Isle <HI>Formosa</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“There was then a great Discourse in Town about that young Man, and every body was willing to know the Truth of his Story. And I was order'd by divers Persons of Quality, and particularly by my Lord—of—, to inform my self as exactly as I could; and in particular, whether it was true that one <HI>Pere de Rhode</HI>, a Jesuit, had arrived at <HI>Avignion</HI> ”from <HI>Formosa</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And because I knew Monsieur <HI>de Lubieres</HI>, the last Governour of <HI>Orange</HI>, was then at <HI>Ge∣neva</HI>, and had divers Friends and Acquaintance at <HI>Avignion</HI>. I wrote to him, praying him to inform me right in this important Affair, in which <HI>the Queen was pleased to interest her∣”self</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It seems an unhappy Errour to give such a weight to this Matter as must needs startle the Jesuits, and put 'em upon their Guard. So that the Truth could not well be ex∣pected.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<Q>“Monsieur <HI>de Lubieres</HI> wrote two Letters up∣on this Subject. One to one <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Avignion</HI>, his intimate Friend; the other to a Jesuit of the Convent at <HI>Avignion</HI>, his near Relation; but who had then been a Year gone from thence to the Jesuits Convent at <HI>Besancon</HI>, in <HI>Franche Comte</HI>, 50 Leagues from <HI>Avignion</HI>. He had Answers sent to both, which say, <HI>This young Man is an Impostor</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Reader will please to note, They speak but of <HI>Two</HI> of this Name, but does not exclude a <HI>Third</HI>, who may be the Man we want.</NOTE>, <HI>for</HI> Pere de Rhode, <HI>who was at</HI> China <HI>and</HI> Formosa, <HI>of which be left an Account in print</HI> 31 <HI>Years ago, dyed at</HI> Ispahan <HI>in</HI> Persia 20 <HI>Years since. And</HI> Pere de Rhode <HI>his Kinsman, who is now in the Jesuits Convent at</HI> Avignion, <HI>has never in his Life-time been ”out of</HI> Avignion, <HI>and consequently not at</HI> China.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Monsieur <HI>de Lubieres</HI> sent me those Letters, which I delivered to my Lord—of— who keeps 'em. This is all I can say in Par∣”ticular of this young Man<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Object. 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Further I observed in his speaking Latin, he could not possibly have learn'd it of a <HI>French</HI> ”Jesuit, but of some <HI>Hollander</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The other Reflections which I have made, and which make me believe the young Man in∣vented his History<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It appears already <HI>he did not invent</HI> all <HI>his History</HI>; his be∣ing at <HI>Avignion</HI> is part of it, and that this Gentleman answers for.</NOTE>, are what all the World ”may make, and therefore I pass 'em by.</Q></P>
<P>Now any Body that reads this Account of these Letters, will wonder they could ever prejudice
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
<HI>Ps—r</HI> at all. (1) <HI>That he was at Avignon</HI> all <HI>Orange</HI> knew. (2) <HI>That he escap'd thence</HI> this Merchant testifies. (3) <HI>That</HI> Ps—r <HI>was the Man who was there</HI>, and thus escap'd, this Gentleman is satisfied; and yet this <HI>Ps—r</HI> must be an Im∣postor, because one <HI>Pere de Rhode</HI> a Missioner died at <HI>Ispahan</HI> twenty Years ago, and <HI>another Pere de Rhode</HI>, who is now in the College, never was a Missionar; but it does not say that there was no Missionar at all, either of that or any o∣ther Name, who came from <HI>Goa</HI> or <HI>Formosa</HI> the time named by <HI>P—r</HI>, and brought with him this or any other <HI>Formosan</HI>. Strange! <HI>That such an imperfect Answer should be allow'd to stifle such a known Truth.</HI> But we think that no Answer whatever, from a Jesuit, should be admitted in a Cause in which they are alarm'd, that it must be to their Prejudice to speak Truth, in which they are told the <HI>Queen of</HI> England <HI>is pleased to concern herself</HI>, since no Protestant would hang a Dog upon such Evidence. Had the Answer been per∣fect, we know they can deny a Name; but when their Answer is so very imperfect, so very Jesui∣tical, what Credit can we give it?</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI>, The Original Account under the Gentle∣man's Hand, who wrote to <HI>Geneva</HI>, is at the Bookseller's for Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Why do you not write again?</HI> say others.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Jesuits are now alarm'd, and will go thorow stitch. Had <HI>Ps—r</HI> been acquain∣ted with their Writing, he could have directed 'em to some body would have told Truth; but now, we fear, the Jesuits will over-awe every body there.</P>
<P N="11">11. This very Gentleman says, it appears to him, <HI>That</HI> Ps—r <HI>learn'd Latin from a</HI> Dutch <HI>Master</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55"/><HI>Answ.</HI> The Language of <HI>Formosa</HI> chiefly em∣ploys those Organs of Speech, which because they are about the Throat, we ask leave to call <HI>Guttural</HI>. The several Languages of <HI>Europe</HI> make principal Use of the other Organs, and for the most part differ from each other. Some use the Lips more, some less, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now since <HI>Ps—r</HI> speaks both the <HI>Formosan</HI>, and most of the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Languages; his pronouncing every one must of necessity be a little toucht with an Accent which results from all the rest. And tho' in some Latin words he may more imitate one sort of Pronun∣ciation than in others, yet it requires better skill than most Men pretend to in any who, in this case, relie upon the manner of <HI>P—r</HI>'s Pro∣nunciation as a Mark sufficient to distinguish his Country.</P>
<P N="11">11. Others object <HI>P—r's Ignorance of the</HI> Chinese <HI>Language</HI>, which they take to be the po∣lite Language of those Parts of the East, as <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But <HI>Varenius</HI> tells us, the <HI>Japponese</HI> have an utter Aversion for the <HI>Chinese</HI>. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Varen. Lib. 1. Cap. 3.</NOTE> And therefore we cannot suppose this to be an Obje∣ction. It confirms him in our an Opinion.</P>
<P N="12">12. Some object his <HI>Staying here</HI>, as an Argument he never came from <HI>Formosa</HI>, for then say they, he would desire to return and convert his Friends. Others on the contrary think <HI>his desiring to re∣turn</HI>, upon an Attempt so very discouraging, looks as if he meant to restore himself to Paganism.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. To the first of these</HI>, we beg leave to af∣firm his Return is concerted, and will be effected in proper time. And we hope <HI>the second</HI> will be convinced by the happy Effects that nothing but
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
the Hopes of the Conversion of <HI>Formosa</HI>, and all the good Consequences of that have moved <HI>P—r</HI> to think of returning to his own Country.</P>
<P N="12">12. His Zeal for the Church of which he is a Member, has induced him <HI>to medle in our Contro∣versy. And this</HI> is alledged by some as an Argu∣ment, of his being in the Interest of <HI>Rome</HI>, whose Policy to destroy us by Divisions is known to eve∣ry Body.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> But for our Parts, we think otherwise, and because the Discernment of such as we may be questioned, we here subjoin our Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st</HI>, The Rule we take to know <HI>the Friends of</HI> Rome in any Controversie about Religion is <HI>the depreciating the Divine Authority of the holy Scrip∣tures</HI>. For unless Mankind could be persuaded to lay aside all Religion, we take it, they will na∣turally fly to the greatest Authority in religious Matters. And we do not know any that bids so fair for this greatest Authority as <HI>Rome</HI>, if the ho∣ly Scriptures could be lay'd aside.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI>, And by this Rule we judge <HI>P—r</HI> no Friend to <HI>Rome</HI>. For his Arguments, all tend to prove the divine Authority of the holy Scriptures, parti∣cularly his Dialogue lately publish'd, which can be prov'd to be wrote by himself, without any other Instigation than Love to Truth.</P>
<P>So that if by any impossible Supposition we ad∣mit <HI>P—r</HI> in the Interest of <HI>Rome</HI>, we must at the same time admit him to carry on his De∣signs by Means directly destructive of any end he can propose for the Service of <HI>Rome</HI>.</P>
<P>These are the material Objections we at any time met, which are reduceable to this Head, save only Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI>'s Book, and that we have re∣ferred to <HI>P—r</HI> himself. It contains asser∣tion of Facts, which are properest for him to an∣swer;
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
since Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> is absent. And therefore we proceed to the last Head of Objections against him.</P>
<P N="3">§. III. And here we confess our selves at the greatest loss: His Hair should be black; his Face yellow, or Olive, or Tawny; his Mien a little more diverse from any, to denote him such a Stran∣ger as he pretends.</P>
<P>But we consider here that in all places there are some who are contrary to the general Co∣lour, &amp;c. of the Country. Some fair in <HI>Afric</HI>, some black in <HI>England</HI>.</P>
<P>And as to his Hair we know not what Influence the Climate he is now in, may have upon the Co∣lour of that. We find many here, whose Hair changes from white to black, and then to white, and this in different Years of their Ages, as the vigour of their Bodies has increased and decayed. Hence we argue, that this Climate may have some Effect upon <HI>P—r</HI>'s Body, and consequently upon the Colour of his Hair; different from his native Country, and so too upon the Colour of his Skin.</P>
<P>The Features of his Face are plainly different from any of <HI>Europe</HI>, and by them he was known to be of <HI>India</HI> by an ingenious Gentleman, who has been many Years there.</P>
<P>And his Soul the principal Part of him, if that may be said to be a part, which has in it self no parts, is certainly agreeable to the Character of the <HI>Japonese</HI>.</P>
<P>Such a ready Apprehension, such an Accuracy in guiding his Judgment; such a constant adhere∣ing to what he judges right; such Contempt of the World and all its Promises, and Threats when they interpose, and would byass his Judg¦ment,
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
are indeed to be found in <HI>Japan</HI> common enough, even natural to the Inhabitants of that Empire. But if the Character of the People of <HI>Europe</HI> (our Queen's Dominions being excluded) may be taken from their natural and acquired En∣dowments, and their Steddiness to that Truth which contradicts their Interests, we may venture any Body to prove <HI>P—r</HI> has a <HI>European</HI> Soul, let his Body be of what part of the World soever, unless he be of our country, as some are pleased to affirm.</P>
<P>And now we may expect it will be inquired <HI>how P—r came to be at all suspected</HI>, since all the Objections against him are so very easily an∣swer'd? And truly we find this the harder Que∣stion to resolve, unless we may be allowed to say <HI>His first Enemies were the Jesuits, and to them chiefly the Loss of his Reputation is owing</HI>. And this Opinion we are induced to by the Reasons fol∣lowing.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> It was <HI>Pere Fountenay a Jesuit</HI>, who made the first Opposition against him before the Royal Society; and who there shew'd a resolve to contradict every thing <HI>P—r</HI> should assert, and carry'd on this Resolve to affirming even that which every one knew to be false. He deny'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> to have any Words ending with a Consonant, that he might deny <HI>P—r</HI>'s saying the <HI>Chinese</HI> call <HI>Formosa</HI> Pac-Ando, <HI>i. e.</HI> the beautiful Island. Tho' by the way we prove they do by Authorities indubitable, and tho' the Names of their own Cities, <HI>Canton, Xanton, Nan∣king, Peking</HI>, &amp;c. all ending with Consonants, abundantly confute the Jesuit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, It is <HI>the Jesuits</HI> who would have <HI>P—r</HI> to be an Impostor, because as they say <HI>one</HI> Pere de Rhode <HI>is no Minissionar</HI>, as is noted
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
already, tho' do but insinuate this by an Answer purely Jesuitical.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly</HI>, It is <HI>a Gentleman of the Roman Church</HI>, who sent us the twenty Queries, as manifestly ap∣pears from the Queries themselves. And tho' by <HI>his Spelling one would think him no Jesuit</HI>, yet Father <HI>Poulton</HI> the Jesuit in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign spelt much after the same Rate in his Letters to Dr. <HI>Tennison</HI> the present Most Reverend Arch-Bi∣shop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th.</HI> Tho' the <HI>great and the noble, the pious and the Learned</HI> among us, who at present suspect <HI>P—r</HI> are not in the Interest of <HI>Rome</HI>, yet even those may be so far <HI>prejudiced by the Jesuits false Reports</HI>, as to be made very capable of being led aside by Arguments of no real Weight. It has been reported <HI>P—r</HI> is in the Interest of the Je∣suits, or is a Jesuit. And after this any true Prote∣stant that loves the <HI>English</HI> Institution, has Reason to suspect a Man concerning whom such things are reported. It is no new thing to our Church to find Enemies in all Shapes. We find even the Character of Churchman has been sometimes made use of as a Cloak to hide the most inveterate E∣nemies of the Church, and therefore well may we suspect any man who is reported a Jesuit, tho' he seems never so good a Churchman.</P>
<P>But then his works would discover the Cloven∣soot. Such Men as these always under Colour of advancing some seeming good have done, or shew'd Designs of doing a real Mischief to our Church. But what does <HI>P—r</HI> do that manifests any such Design? He is upon all Occasions <HI>a zea∣lous Defender of Episcopacy, and our Liturgy</HI>; and by <HI>his constant regular Behaviour</HI> adorns his holy Profession. He receives <HI>the Holy Commu∣nion</HI> with a Frequency more than usual among or∣dinary
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
Professors. He diligently <HI>attends those Preachers, whose Sermons have</HI> the greatest Pro∣bability of being most edifying; such as have the best composition, that <HI>of Piety and Learning</HI>. He has <HI>appeared in Print in behalf of</HI> that holy Book to which we owe our present Happiness and future Hopes <HI>The holy Bible</HI>, which one thing alone does <HI>with us</HI> argue him <HI>no Jesuit</HI>, nor at all in their Interest, for they and their Abettors as much as possible <HI>run down the holy Scriptures</HI>, and set up some other Authorities, well foreseeing all other Authority about Religion must at last end in that of the Roman Tradition. It may be said that <HI>his being reported a Jesuit could not come from the Jesuits</HI>, but they who say this shew only their own Ignorance of the Jesuits management, who for the most part make the loudest Noise against the Pope to render themselves less suspected, while under the Pretence of farther Reformation they divide, and as far as they can destroy us. And therefore we hope it will not be thought Irrational to suppose the Jesuits to ruin our Convert may be the Authors of the Slander that he is a Jesuit.</P>
<P>Therefore that we may detain the Reader no longer, we shall conclude our Enquiry with re∣peating an Apology for the Plainness and want of Eloquence that we are very conscious has appear'd in every Page. We are <HI>Plebeians</HI>, and the utmost of our Education has been confined to the Grammar School. If any Logick appears it is purely natural, and as for Rhetorick we have not the least Pretence to it.</P>
<P>It is confessed we wish heartily we had some De∣gree of that last named Science, for then this En∣quiry should have been set off with a neat Conclusi∣on, which might have induced the World to have once more entertain'd a good Opinion of the Man
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
we think very much deserving it, and very much wronged by evil Reports and unreasonable sus∣picious.</P>
<P>And particularly we would have remarked up∣on the signal Series of God's especial providence that conducted <HI>Psalmanaazaar</HI> hither from Paga∣nism to the most pure and Primitive part of the Church, from the farthest Eastern to the farthest Western Isles of the World; thro' Dangers by Sea and by Land, from Friends and from Enemies, from Strangers and from false Brethren. We could also have told you in proper Words, tho' not adequate, because not sufficient to express the Indowments natural and acquired, and the Merit and real Worth of the Man, thus by God's Pro∣vidence hither conducted; and the Honour that redounds to our Church by such a Conversion. And lastly for the Sake of some, who have no Notion of any other Recommendation, we would have told you what it appears to us he loses by being a Christian, what Riches, what Honours he has thereby made impracticable to receive at his Return, and how he willingly forgoes any Hopes of 'em, for the Sake of the Gospel of our Saviour, which he resolves to carry thither at the hazard of his Life.</P>
<P>And here we might have reviewed all the Ob∣jections against him, and reflected upon the Suc∣cess of such pitiful and mean Indeavours to ruin such a Man's Reputation, upon which not only his Quiet, but his very Life depends, and a great Addition both to the Glory of our Church, and to the Number of its Members, by the Conversion of the great and populous, the Rich, and the potent Empire of <HI>Japan</HI>, of which <HI>Formosa</HI> is a very con∣siderable dependant, and the only door by which our Religion can enter as things now are.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62"/>But we must leave this to the Reader to do for himself, we can only add our hearty Prayers that God would move the Hearts of all sincere Chri∣stians to promote the Conversion of <HI>Japan</HI>, and in order thereto to incourage and assist the noble In∣tentions of this Convert, the First Fruits of the <HI>East Indias</HI>.</P>
<P>For whose Conversion to our most holy Faith, we heartily give all Praise and Glory to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, the holy and undivided Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead. For his Honour and out of conscience of our Duty to him we have made Enquiry, which we hope will satisfie the World, <HI>That</HI> P—r <HI>is the Man he pretends to be, and that the History of</HI> Formosa, <HI>and of his Travels, is true, and his Conversion to our Faith sincere and unfeigned</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>To the HONOURABLE GEORGE LAWDER, Major General in the Service of the States Generals of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Think I owe you as much as Mr. <HI>d'Almal∣vy</HI> these few Lines I have drawn in an∣swer to a Book which he dedicated to your Ho∣nour. I could not but wonder at his present∣ting to you that Piece of his, in which he so highly complains of you, of Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> and me, about what hapened in <HI>Sluice</HI> at the time of my Conversion; when he knows at the same time that your Honour was pleased to favour me with a Certificate under your Hand and Seal, in which you highly approve of Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s Proceedings, and give that just Praise due to him for so charitable and pious a Deed. This is as much as desiring of you to retract what you said in that Certificate, and to join
<PB REF="65"/>
with him in abusing Mr. <HI>Innes,</HI> whom you had so justly praised.</P>
<P>Therefore to justifie you and Mr. <HI>Innes,</HI> as well as my self, if I can call Justification, the refuting some malicious Insinuations of Mr. <HI>d'A∣malvy;</HI> I have summed up whatever he has objected, and answered it, begging of you to join the Acceptance of this to all other Favours conferred upon,</P>

<HEAD>GEORGE PSALMANAAZAAR'S ANSWER TO M. <HI>d'AMALVY</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THE Book that I am now answering, having been seen by so few here in <HI>England</HI>, and it being hardly worth the while to copy it throughout, I thought it the best way to take a short Abstract of all the Objections made by the Author, and an∣swer them, leaving his Book at my Booksellers for any who think it worth their while to exa∣mine it. Therefore without any farther Preamble I come to</P>
<P>Pag. 1<HI>st.</HI> Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> thinking it was Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> that wrote my Book in French, takes an Oppor∣tunity of exposing him thus.
<Q>“The Author, <HI>says he,</HI> of <HI>Psalmanaazaar</HI>'s History either wanted Honesty or good Memoires, that he did therefore endeavour to conceal his Name under the Letters of <HI>S. N. F. D. B. R.</HI> for fear People should think ”he has said too much in his own Praise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67"/>I think Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> will not be very well pleased when I come to undeceive him. All <HI>Eng∣land</HI> knows that I first writ the Book in Latin, that afterwards it was done into English, then a French Gentleman turned it into French, and the aforesaid Letters spell neither more nor less than <HI>Sieur Nicolas Francois Du Bois Refugie</HI>.</P>
<P>But however he says that <HI>this French Author</HI>, (Translator he should call him) <HI>wanted either Honesty or good Memoirs</HI>, I say, perhaps, he want∣ed neither. For <HI>first</HI>, as to the former, some gross Blunders he has made in his Translation, but has for the most part faithfully followed my sense in every thing else. And by the way I must acquaint the Reader that as to those Faults which are in the French; I will by no means be accountable for them, and therefore shall refer him to my own Original, to be seen at the Booksellers, or to the English Translation. But these Mistakes I do not think willful. And, <HI>secondly</HI>, As to his want <HI>of good Memoirs</HI>, is what I shall con∣sult Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> in: <HI>Pag.</HI> 4. he says, that "<HI>when one thinks seriously upon what past amongst the great Multitude of Proselytes he cannot for∣bear saying, me vestigia terrent</HI>. But any Body that had seen what passed in my Conversion can very well perceive that this is only <HI>a very mali∣cious Reflection</HI>. For he could be informed from my Captain how I had been banish'd the Elector of <HI>Colen</HI>'s Service, because I would not turn Pa∣pist. All my Regiment could certifie him how I was there courted by <HI>Papists, Lutherans</HI>, and <HI>Calvinists</HI> to turn, and even very richly offer'd, whether by way of treat, or in good earnest, I know not; but however I refused all other means to be converted, but the right one, which was arguing. In <HI>Sluice</HI> I was, as he says, for long
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
time unknown by all except those of my Regi∣ment. I did not go to look after him, but he af∣ter me; and I should then have been very glad if he would have let me alone as I was, tho' I now bless God he found me out.</P>
<P>But besides if he was so suspicious of me, why was <HI>he so hot and desirous to convert me?</HI> Why <HI>with me for not going to him when he would have me?</HI> But of this enough.</P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> He employs all his Eloquence <HI>in vindica∣ting the Learning of the Ministers of</HI> Boisleduc: But he might as well have employed it in vindicating their Eye-sight as their Learning, for as I never did call 'em blind, neither did I ever call 'em ignorant, either in Discourse or Writing, to which I dare challenge all the World.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 5. He begins <HI>the History of my Conversion from the Day I was sent for by Brigadier Lawder</HI>. Very well! Only he omits this Circumstance, that <HI>he also was invited</HI>, and came accordingly, but having heard what he was sent for, <HI>he excused him∣self, and went away again without speaking a word to me</HI>. Wherefore, <HI>Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>supplied his place</HI>, but the Discourse ran more upon the Relation of my Country than Disputes of Religion; but two Days after I was invited by Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> to his Chamber, where <HI>Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>came also, and with whom I had that Conference I speak of in my Book</HI>, pag. 207<HI>th.</HI> so that his not being at the Bri∣gadier <HI>Lawder</HI>'s was no fault of mine.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> he nameth <HI>the several Gentlemen that were present at our Conference</HI>, 'tis more than I could do, and goes on very right <HI>pag.</HI> 7, 8, and 9<HI>th.</HI> and agrees very well with my English Book. As for the French, as I have already said, I have no∣thing to do with the Mistakes made by the Tran∣slator.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69"/>Pag. 10. He informs the Reader
<Q>“that after I had told him the chief Heads of my Religion he objected against them, because they did not an∣”swer the Notions we had premised of a God, <HI>but he says not a word of what these were he obje∣cted against</HI>.</Q>
But they were <HI>the Sacrifices of Chil∣dren</HI>, and <HI>the Apparition of our God in the Shape of a Bull</HI>, &amp;c. upon which I retorted to him <HI>his absolute Predestination</HI>, and <HI>the Appearance of the Holy Ghost in the Shape of a Dove</HI>, which he did not answer, neither would he let any Body else answer.</P>
<P>After this the Reader may judge whether <HI>I had any great Encouragement to go to him any more</HI>. However, as he said, <HI>Pag.</HI> 11. <HI>he did desire me to meet him at his House, for he was of opinion a private Conference between him and me</HI>, Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>, how∣ever admitted, <HI>would be better than one where there are so many</HI>. However, tho' I did not then refuse the Appointment, yet when the Day was come I could not find in my Heart to keep it, for I was persuaded he could not answer my Objections, and therefore <HI>was very willing to be quiet, and conti∣nue as I was</HI>. However <HI>private</HI> this Company was to be, yet he complains that <HI>I did disappoint a great many Gentlemen and Ladies</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 12. He tells you "<HI>of my having been car∣ried before the Consistory of</HI> Sluice. Right! And when we have abated the Eloquence with which he praises himself, and the Consistory, it amounts to no more than this, that they <HI>did not think fit to honour me with their Attention</HI>, which how just and reasonable Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> may call it, yet it does not appear so to me, neither does he give any Reason in his Book, nor they then, why they would not hear me; saving, that it was too soon for me to answer for my Conversion, which by the way, they could not be judges of. Besides there
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
was no Obligation either on Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s side or mine to appear before the said Consistory, there∣fore he ought not to be so very angry with me for refusing to repeat the same voluntary Act. Wherefore, in the stead of it Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> sent to them a Letter, whereof he now in <HI>Portugal</HI> has the Copy, therefore I can say but little of the Abstract, which Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> has took out of the Acts of his Consistory, in which, first they <HI>censure Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>for saying in the said Letter, that he did not carry me to the Consistory with a Design of making them Judges, but only Wit∣nesses of my Conversion</HI>. Now I don't see where the harm of that is; for first, <HI>the Reason why Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>did carry me to them</HI>, was because they were dissa∣tisfied at my Conversion, and whispered about that it was too hasty to be sincere, therefore they seem'd affraid least Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had used <HI>some other Means</HI> than Arguments to convert me. Wherefore to prevent <HI>their false Suspicion and Slander</HI>, I de∣signed <HI>they themselves should see they were in the wrong</HI>.</P>
<P>And <HI>2dly, Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>would have been very im∣prudent had he submitted to their Judgement in this Case</HI>, for they who think and call the Church of <HI>England</HI> Heterodox would never have thought me qualified for Baptism, tho' I had believed all the said Church affirms.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, in this abstract
<Q>“they complain of Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> for writing a Letter so unworthy a Mi∣”nister of the Gospel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
I have no Copy of the said Letter, therefore all I can say is, that I don't remember any <HI>thing in it that deserved such Epi∣thets</HI>. But why was not Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> so kind as either to transcribe or translate it, and put it in his Book that the Reader might have judged of it himself.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="64" REF="71"/>3<HI>dly, They complain of "the Brigadier</HI> Lawder "<HI>that he would not meddle in this Affair</HI>. That is in short, because he would not shew his Authority over Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>, and his Submission to them in forbidding Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> to proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y farther in my Conversion till the said Consistory should think meet. But I thought the Brigadier <HI>Lawder</HI> had given them sufficient Reason why he would not have a Hand in it, in saying <HI>that he was a Sol∣dier, and not a Bishop, and therefore such things were out of his Power, and out of his way</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 17. he proceeds in <HI>his History of my Bap∣tism</HI>, in which he finds the following Faults.
<Q>“First that it was on a Sunday Night at seven of the Clock, a time in which there is no publick Service performed. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that it was all done on a sudden, without my being brought be∣fore any Ecclesiastical assembly there to be exa∣”mined, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Thirdly, <HI>That the Ceremony was performed, without any Necessity in an unknown Languague</HI>, viz. <HI>in Latin, which was understood but by some of 'em that were present</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And 1<HI>st, As to the time</HI> I do think it indiffe∣rent, neither do I know of any Articles, or any Canons of the Church of <HI>England</HI> that appoints any certain time for it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly, As to my Baptism being performed with∣out my having been brought before an Ecclesiasti∣cal Assembly</HI>, &amp;c. is false, for Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy owns</HI> that I was brought before their Consistory for that purpose. <HI>And</HI> 2<HI>dly</HI>, upon their Refusal, which I could not help, <HI>Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>had me twice exa∣min'd, first</HI> by the Chaplain of our Regiment, and some more Gentlemen, who tho' not Divines, yet could very well judge whether the Arguments I brought for my Conversion were sufficient. 2<HI>dly, I was examined</HI> by the Minister of St. <HI>Ann</HI>, a Vil∣lage
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
distant about three Miles from <HI>Sluice</HI>; he came on purpose at the desire of Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>, and is a Man reckoned by them all, and I am sure by Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> himself, to be <HI>a Man of profound Learning</HI>, and all these Gentlemen gave me <HI>a Cer∣tificate under their Hands and Seals, of their hav∣ing duly examin'd me, and not only found me fitly qualified for Baptism, but also, that they thought it cruel and unchristian to delay my Baptism any longer</HI>, which Certificates, if questioned, Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> can produce. Besides, Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> knows very well that the next Day after my Baptism, I wrote <HI>six Copies of the Arguments, by which, with the Grace of God Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>did convert me, one of which I sent the Consistory</HI>, the others I distributed to se∣veral of the most judicious Persons of the Town, and <HI>this is as much I think as the severest Examen</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly, As to the Latin Tongue</HI>, being used in the Ceremony Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> may call it <HI>an unknown Tongue</HI>, if it was so to him.</P>
<P>But there was <HI>a Necessity of using the Latin Tongue</HI>, for as for <HI>English, Dutch, German</HI>, or <HI>French</HI>, if one of the Company understood it, the other did not, <HI>but Latin all understood</HI> who were invited to the Ceremony, for as for those that came by chance, we could not provide a Language for them.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 18. He brings <HI>that Article of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>in which the use of an unknown Tongue is condemned, as contrary to God's Word</HI>, but what I have already said answers that too.</P>
<P><Q>“Pag. <HI>18. He tells you,</HI> that the Regiment of Buckwold being come to <HI>Sluice</HI> again, the Chap∣lain thereof, Peligrim by name, made Complaints to the Consistory of the Proceedings of Mr. <HI>Innes,</HI> begging of 'em to grant him a Certificate in due
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
and lawful Forms, as an Atestation how Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had carried on this matter, the Company not be∣ing able to refuse so reasonable a Request have attested that it was to their great Sorrow and Grief that they did behold the Irregularity of Mr. <HI>Innes,</HI> in a Business of so great Moment, and that he did offer to keep the sole Conduct of it to himself in the stead of acting in concert with them, that he would baptize me without his com∣municating it to them and at a time when no divine Service is perform'd, and in an unknown Tongue. And in short, they fill the said Attestation with all their Grievances, which have been already mentioned, and so the said Certificate, <HI>signed by</HI> Isaac d'Amalvy <HI>the Consistory's Secretary</HI> in Name of the whole Company, is delivered to the ”said Peligrim.</Q></P>
<P>I could wonder my self old to see <HI>this Chaplain</HI> of our Regiment, <HI>after the Certificate he had given Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>after he had examined me</HI>, go now to make such Complaints, and specially to such as could but <HI>poorly</HI> redress him.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 22. The Author makes some Reflections from what has been said before, as thus,
<Q>“Hence the Reader may see, that Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had seen <HI>Psal∣”manaazaar</HI> before me.</Q>
—But whose Fault was it but his that went away when he was sent for to speak to me? and then
<Q>“Psalmanaazaar says that I went the next Morning to beg a Conference with him, which is false, for it was Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> that did ”it.</Q>
Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> is in the right, but it is not me but the <HI>French</HI> Translator, who is in the wrong, and had he well looked to the Original, he would not have committed that Error contrary to my As∣sertion, <HI>p.</HI> 207.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="74"/><HI>Pag.</HI> 24. He complains, and that very justly too, of an Assertion in the <HI>French</HI>, which says thus,
<Q>“that at our first meeting Mr. d'Amalvy promi∣sed me that he would turn of my Religion, if he ”could not make a Christian of me,</Q>
but this is a horri∣ble blunder of the <HI>French</HI> Translator, for my <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> runs thus,
<Q>“He made me this Promise before them all, that if I could shew more Evidence for the Truth of my Religion than he could for the Truth of his, he would gladly renounce his, and embrace ”mine; <HI>which Assertion Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>owns to have said</HI> vide <HI>his Book,</HI> p. <HI>7</HI>th.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 26. He is very sharp upon me for calling Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s little pitiful Chamber, as he calls it, <HI>a publick assembly</HI>, and for calling the Number of Six <HI>a great Number of Persons</HI>.</P>
<P>I wish Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> in the stead of criticizing upon Words and Expressions, would mind some more momentous Business, then there would be less Time and Paper wasted, but then he should have lost this favourable Opportunity of telling the World that Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had <HI>a little pittiful Cham∣ber</HI>. He had best in the stead of boasting so much of his Humility, go and learn first in the Second Chapter of St. <HI>Luke</HI>, where the King of Heaven and Earth chose to lye in State. 'Tho' by the way, Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s Chamber was not so pitiful, nor so little, but it could serve him to all Intents, and such as some Captains were very well pleased with before him, for <HI>Sluice</HI> being a miserably built Place, there are no good Lodgings to be let there.</P>
<P>And as for my Calling those that were present <HI>a multitude of Persons</HI>, tho' it does not run well in <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French</HI>, yet in <HI>Latin</HI> it might pass. For <HI>multitudo hominum</HI>, and <HI>multi homines</HI>, do not
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
seem to be so different, therefore he might have spared his scurrilous Allegory of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Spectacles, Microscopes, Polyledres, which is full of Malice against not only me, but <HI>the whole Church of</HI> England; for granting my Ex∣pressions were ever so hyperbolical and false, he would not have gone to expose the whole Church for it, had he had any respect for a Church, which is reverenced and admired by such as he ought, at least in Modesty, to think better than him∣self.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 29. He accuses me of having <HI>omitted what we spoke of first in our Conference, viz.</HI> we agreed upon certain Characteristicks of a God, and a true Notion of our selves, which I must own I omitted for shortness Sake, as not being material in what I was about then.</P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> He denies that I made any such Retortion to him as I have affirmed, and is angry at the Ex∣pressions, which are indeed of the <HI>French</HI> Tran∣slator's own putting, for he words it thus, <HI>at which the Minister was surprized, puzled and confounded</HI>, whereas my <HI>English</HI> says that <HI>to these Retortions he could not answer</HI>, which appears by his not answering. Then my Author continues, <HI>If</HI> Psalmanaazaar <HI>did so gloriously conquer me, why did he not challenge my Promise of turning a Pa∣gan</HI>; but as I have shewed it was a false Tran∣slation. Besides, tho' he made that Offer of himself, yet I would have him to know it was not my Business, nor my Desire to make any Prose∣lytes to my Religion; glad was I when I could enjoy it my self without being disturbed by others. Neither have I said any where that I had proved my Religion to be better than his, tho' he sad∣ly complains of it, for as I desired only to act
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
defensively. If I here say that he could not an∣swer my Objections that does not prove my hav∣ing convinced him of the Truth of my Religion, nor my boasting of it; for many times one can prove a contrary Opinion absurd, and at the same time not be able to prove one's own.</P>
<P>But pag. 35. <HI>He Denies my having made the said Retortions</HI>, saying that if I had he would surely have answered them, and he does answer them hereafter, how well we shall see when we come to it.</P>
<P>But as for his present <HI>Denial</HI>, I think he does take but an indifferent Method of arguing. Does he think that his bare Denial is sufficient against what I affirm, when witnessed by Mr. <HI>Innes?</HI> Since he is so near these Gentlemen who were present at our Conference, let him make them attest it under their Hands. I appeal to the same Gentlemen for the Truth, I have advanced; in the mean time let us hear his Answer to the said Retortions.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>, says he, <HI>pag.</HI> 37.
<Q>“<HI>Psalmanaazaar</HI> is in the wrong for calling the Doctrine of Predesti∣nation, and Reprobation frightful Doctrines, and ”contrary to all Laws of Religion.</Q>
If I was the first that ever say'd so, I should think my self oblig'd to say somewhat for my self, but since I have such great Number of learned Men, who not only called it so, but proved it such before me, therefore my best way, I think, is to stand be∣hind them, and hold my Tongue.</P>
<P>Ibid. He says,
<Q>“I use affected Expressions, which are too violent, too uncharitable, and too unworthy ever to come from the Mouth of a Pro∣”selyte.</Q>
But for my life I can't find the Reason on't, for I should think it more probable that a
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
Proselyte should use such Expressions, (if mine are really as he says, which I won't own) than a Man educated in the Christian Religion. And as for that Charity, he speaks of, which unites the Two Churches of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>, it does no ways hinder People from arguing against such Principles of either, as seem either absurd, or con∣trary to God's Word. But I would be glad to see Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> shew a little of that Charity to∣wards the Churches of <HI>England</HI>, which upon a Fault of mine he did but now banter with his Alle∣gory of Spectacles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Neither do I remember that ever I perceived the least <HI>Glimpse of it in him towards Mr.</HI> Innes, for he was so far from that, that he would <HI>oppose</HI> him in every thing; call him <HI>a Heretick</HI>, and publickly condemn him as <HI>a scandalous Man, an unworthy Minister</HI> for pow∣dering of his Hair, and playing upon Musical In∣struments, and such like innocent things; and which is more, did <HI>prosecute him</HI> before the States, for having baptized a Child of one of his own Re∣giment, and of the Church of <HI>England</HI>. Let the Reader be Judge who has trespassed more upon Charity.</P>
<P><Q>“I will believe, <HI>saith he,</HI> p. <HI>38.</HI> That this Do∣ctrine of Predestination is contrary to the Rea∣son of Mr. <HI>Psalmanaazaar,</HI> but the Question is, whether his Reason be decisive in this Particu∣”lar.</Q>
I never did say it was, neither do I think it is so <HI>as to any Body else</HI>, but <HI>as to my self it must be decisive</HI>, else I must pin my Faith on his Sleeve, which I can not yet do.</P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> He says,
<Q>“That it is no way against the Justice or Goodness and Mercy of God, to do with his Creatures what he thinks fit, and that since he is the Lord and Maker of all things,
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
why should he not show his Power over his Crea∣tures, in making some of 'em happy, and some of 'em miserable, specially when the Scripture teaches us that he does, and can without our be∣”ing able to say why, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I must refer Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> to <HI>Limburgh</HI>'s <HI>Theolo∣gia Christiana</HI>, in which he proves clearly all the Pas∣sages of the Scriptures, made use of by <HI>the Pre∣destinarians</HI> to prove that Doctrine, are screwed out of their proper Sense, and contrary to the De∣sign of the Holy Ghost; which Book Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> recommended to me that I might be assured that <HI>there is nothing in the Bible that does prove that Doctrine</HI>. And the Article of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> says, <HI>Nothing can be receiv'd as of Faith, but what can be proved there</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly, God's Power over his Creatures</HI>, in my Opinion, does not prove that he can exert the same in making some of 'em miserable without their having deserved it by their Deeds.</P>
<P>But 3<HI>dly, Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>has forgot my Retorti∣on</HI>, for <HI>the more he vindicates the Doctrines of Re∣probation the more he justifies the Sacrifices of Chil∣dren</HI>; for if a just and merciful God can without Breach of these Attributes condemn so many Men to eternal Miseries, without regard to their Acti∣ons, much more can he require the Death of a Number of Children, when they are sure to gain an eternal Life by it. So that Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> has said nothing to my Argument.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 41. He endeavours to insinuate me no true Convert, because I do not hold Predestination.
<Q>“P—r, <HI>says he,</HI> declareth War with the Church of <HI>England</HI> it self, who has in one of the ”<HI>39</HI> Articles declared for that Doctrine.</Q>
And then he repeats that Article. But had he attended to that and the rest he would have found the Church
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
of <HI>England</HI> doth not hold Predestination. And the very Article he quotes could have shew'd him, that she never proposed to be thought a Favourer of such Doctrine. For,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st</HI>, In Article 2 and 31, are these words, <HI>the Offering of Christ, is that perfect Redemption, Pro∣pitiation and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, both original and actual</HI>. And in the 16<HI>th</HI> even in the very next before that of Predesti∣nation we find this Assertion, <HI>that after</HI> we have received the Holy Ghost, we may <HI>depart from Grace given, and fall into Sin</HI>. Now what can Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> say to this, if Christ <HI>died for all the World</HI>, then not <HI>for the Elect only</HI>; if they, <HI>who have received the holy Ghost</HI> may fall away, then no one can <HI>be absolutely predestinated</HI>, unless, to receive the Holy Ghost, in the 16<HI>th</HI> Article be dif∣ferent from the same, in the 17 Article. Some other Spectacles than any Christian, not to say <HI>English</HI>∣man uses, must be found out to discover how these Articles can be said <HI>to affirm Predestination</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI>, And in the very Article quoted by Mr. <HI>d'A∣malvy</HI>, it is plain, <HI>that the Church of</HI> England <HI>ne∣ver intended to be thought a Favourer of that Do∣ctrine</HI>. She has indeed <HI>defined</HI> the Word, but not <HI>affirmed</HI> the thing; so far from that is she, that she cautions the Generality of Men against so much as thinking at all of it. Let Mr. <HI>d' A∣malvy</HI> read her Words,
<Q>“for curious and carnal Persons lacking the Spirit of God to have conti∣nually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous Downfal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them into despera∣”tion, <HI>or</HI> wretchlesness of most unclean Living.</Q>
Let him seriously consider whether <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Hy∣pocrisie, Envy</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI>, be not the spiritual
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
Impurities, and Uncleanness here meant. Let him if he can assign any other Cause, why a Gentleman, his own Name-sake, was thrust into this <HI>most dan∣gerous downfal</HI>, other than <HI>his having continually before his Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestina∣tion</HI>. What else could move Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> to be so angry at my not being baptized by him, and owning my Conversion to the Christian Religion to be by his Arguments; unless because he thinks himself <HI>a chosen Vessel elected to do every thing he thinks honourable and great</HI>; and is not this <HI>Pride?</HI> And does he not in this prefer his own Honour to that of our common Lord and Saviour? He had rather, as is now plain, that I had never been bap∣tized, than himself thus affronted thereby, and yet at the same time he pretends a mighty Zeal for the Faith. Do I miscal this, when I say 'tis <HI>Hy∣pocrisie</HI>; and if his Practices, then and since are not Instances of Malice and Envy, and if that and those do not proceed from the same bitter Root, that proud Opinion of his being elected, let the Rea∣der judge, or rather let Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> himself think upon it, as for me I am little disturbed at his Proceeding, but rather pray God to forgive him.</P>
<P>And that the Reader may see I had Reason to stand off from the Church of <HI>Geneva</HI>, I have here incerted that part of their Confession of Faith, in which the Doctrine of Predestination is asser∣ted, which take as follows.</P>
<P><Q>“We believe that from the general Corruption and Condemnation, in which all Men are plunged, God does draw those, whom by his eternal and unchangeable purpose he has elected by his alone Goodness and Mercy in our Lord Jesus Christ, without any Consideration of their Work, <HI>leaving
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
the Rest in the same Corruption and Condem∣nation to manifest his Justice in them, as upon the first he makes to shine the Richness of his Mercy</HI>. For you are not better than the other, <HI>until God has made the Difference</HI> according to his immutable Purpose, which he has determined in Jesus Christ before the Foundation of the World. And also no one is able to put himself into so great a Good <HI>by his own proper Vertue,</HI> for as much as of our Nature we cannot have any good Motion, nor Will, nor Thought, unless God has ”disposed us thereto.</Q>
Art. 12th.</P>
<P>And I do here again declare, that had the Church of <HI>England</HI> maintained the same I could never have joined with it.</P>
<P>Pag. 44. <HI>He also denies the Retortion I made to him of the Apparition of the Holy Ghost</HI>, tho' with as little Reason as he denies that of absolute Pre∣destination, and I appeal to these Gentlemen that were present, let them declare who is right.
<Q>“But, <HI>quoth he,</HI> granting he had made the said Retortion, why? is it so bad with me, that am a Minister of the Gospel, that I could not have answered it when any of our Students would be able to do it. I am sure, <HI>continueth he,</HI> if you ask any of 'em whether that Dove was the Image of the Holy Ghost, to which we ought to pay any divine Worship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they'll say no, but that it is, as the Cloud in the old Times, a pe∣culiar and extraordinary Sign of the actual Presence, and Manifestation of the divine Per∣”son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now let any Soul alive judge whether this is answering my Argument, for I never told him that <HI>either that Bull, Lion</HI>, &amp;c. were <HI>Gods to whom we ought to pay any Homage</HI>, but rather, that they
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
were only <HI>Signs of the more immediate Presence of our God</HI>, and of his being either <HI>angry or well pleased with his People</HI>. I pass by his accustomed Language, when his Argument is wrong.</P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>Psalmanaazaar, says he,</HI> Pag. <HI>41.</HI> Will make me pass for a mightier Man than I am, when he says that my bare saying hold your Tongue, could silence the whole Company in a Cause, where∣in the Truth of the Gospel was to run such great ”hazard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What I asserted in my Book, <HI>Pag.</HI> 208. I stand to, and say again, let the Gentlemen say whether Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> and I being engaged in this Dispute; a Gentleman that did offer me to put in a Word, and Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> stopt him, by saying, <HI>Sir, we cannot speak all together, pray let me go on in my Discourse</HI>. Now whether this is not silencing the Company, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P><HI>Why</HI>, says he, <HI>pag.</HI> 49 <HI>and</HI> 50, <HI>Ought any Body</HI>
<Q>“to think that I am so self conceited, as not to have owned my self embarrassed with his Argument, ”had I been really so, <HI>&amp;c. a pretty way of com∣ing of:</HI></Q>
But, Sir, you have neither answered my Argument, nor own'd your self embarrassed. I shall pass by all the false Reflections he maketh from what he has said here, and the divers Slan∣ders he throws both at Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> and me. He's too wise, and too innocent to mind them, and as for me, whether I do deserve this Language or not, let the Reader judge. However, to his praise be it, that gives it, for he gives it very very heartily, but God grant him better Marks of his being predestinate.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="83"/><HI>Pag.</HI> 52. He comes again upon me, because I say in my Book, that
<Q>“he was preaching Humi∣lity to me, where I saw the contrary in his Words ”and Behaviour.</Q>
To which among other things, not worth being here incerted, he says,
<Q>“That I must be very penetrating to have discovered any Pride in him at one single meeting: But, however, that I ought to have shewed more of a true Proselyte in me, and not have gone and ex∣posed a Minister, whom one cannot expose with∣out exposing his Ministry, and consequently the ”Truth of the Gospel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But first, I think, I needed not to be so sharp-sighted to have discovered him such as I repre∣sent him, and if I had been then mistaken, he should have done something since to have con∣vinced me of it. But instead of that his present Eclarcissement will shew the World I have made no Error. I wish for his own Sake I had.</P>
<P>I own I have trespassed upon that Charity, which all Christians ought to have; and that in more Instances than this, but then I beg of him not to make my Fault greater than it is, in saying that I re∣flected consequently upon the Ministry and Gospel it self, for I don't think it does follow: Faults be∣ing personal. And if the bad Lives of Christians and Ministers was any Argument against the Chri∣stian Religion, I am afraid that it ould be far from being the best in the World, and the onely true one. But I don't think any Body so simple, even of his Congregation that would think worse of the Go∣spel, because the Minister does not live according to it.</P>
<P><Q>“However, <HI>saith he,</HI> p. <HI>54.</HI> I do promise the Author and Mr. <HI>Psalmanaazaar</HI> I will make a good use of his Reproach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For was it a second
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
<HI>Shimei</HI>'s Discourse ought not one to make a Profit ”of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
But tho' Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> would make no difference between <HI>David</HI> and himself; yet he ought not not to have compared me to <HI>Shimei</HI>, for I never did curse him in Thought or Word, and I do assure him I am very thankful to him for his exhorting me to Charity and Humility, <HI>vid. p.</HI> 54, 55, and 56. and promise him without compa∣ring him to <HI>Shimei</HI>, I will indeavour, God help∣ing, to follow those Rules he therein gives me. But his Practice contradicts his own Pro∣fession.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 48. He complains of my <HI>promoting</HI> Ana∣themas <HI>in my Book against the Church of</HI> Holland, <HI>and appeals to the</HI> 8, 13 and 14 <HI>Propositions</HI>, vide pag. 216. Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> will remember that I told him in <HI>Sluice</HI> upon this Head, that if he could answer these Propositions I wou'd be of his Church, <HI>vide pag.</HI> 217. which was very fair, and now I repeat the Offer to him, and am ready to fulfil it when he shall have answered all those Propositions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which if he does not, I shall not value the Epithets he gives 'em.</P>
<P>This is all I have found that seemed to carry any Argument with it, as for the rest of the Book, <HI>i. e.</HI> from pag. 59 to 64, which is the last Page, there is nothing but a Mixture of <HI>S— M— S— P</HI>—, and whatsoever the Reader shall be pleased to call it.</P>
<P>But I will not conclude without telling him that all he has done shall never hinder me from being in perfect Charity with him. Neither should I have answered his Book, had he not in it cast some Reflections on the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> which could by no means admit of any Si∣lence in me; for were it such as he has represen∣ted
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
it, what honest Pagan can come over to it, or could not use his own words.</P>
<Q>Me vestigia terrent.</Q>
<P>But I thank God I have found it far otherwise than he makes it, and such as is very well wor∣thy all the Sufferings I have by his Book, or otherwise undergone, and therefore to that holy Spirit, by whose Light I have been thus con∣vinced, together with the Father and the Son three Persons and one God, be all Honour and Glory. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
