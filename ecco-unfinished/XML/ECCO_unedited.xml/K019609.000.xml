<LG>
<L>HOW goes it my HAMLET, thou prince of the bridle?</L>
<L>Who to work art so ready, tho' I am oft idle—</L>
<L>In thy walk, trot, or gallop, when didst thou need whipping?</L>
<L>Or a spur to thy side, who art never caught tripping?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Does <HI>Bob</HI> always dress thee well, comb thee, and curry?</L>
<L>I mean as he ought to do, not in a hurry;</L>
<L>Does he act as a friend to thee, not as a stranger?</L>
<L>Is there hay in thy rack, and good oats in thy manger?</L>
<L>With plenty of straw does he make up thy bed?</L>
<L>As oft as is proper to water art led?</L>
<L>That he ever has done so, <HI>Bob</HI> makes it his boast;</L>
<L>I'm inclin'd to believe him for HAMLET's no <HI>ghost.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good fare thou shalt have, and kind usage besides,</L>
<L>Since much I do owe thee for all my sweet rides.</L>
<L>With health, noble HAMLET, instruction I've caught,</L>
<L>Which thou from thy Master of old must have brought;</L>
<L>He gave me a treasure I could not withstand,</L>
<L>And nought but what's good ever came from his hand;</L>
<L>His manners so gentle, his heart free from blame,</L>
<L>Thy master of old is a WOLFF
<NOTE PLACE="foot">a GEORGE WOLFT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Danish Consul, who gave the Horse.</NOTE> but in name.</L>
</LG>

<L>My HAMLET, I tell thee, with thanks for thy pains,</L>
<L>'Tis thou may'st be trusted, not I, with the reins;</L>
<L>Tho' I bridle thy tongue, yet I fear 'twill be shown</L>
<L>There still is much need of well curbing my <HI>own.</HI></L>

<L>The loss of thine eye, tho' a blemish it be,</L>
<L>Gives also, good HAMLET, instruction to me;</L>
<L>And hints to all those, who that blemish deride,</L>
<L>That tho' they have two eyes, they <HI>have a blind side.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' the journey of life let us keep the right road,</L>
<L>Tho' heavy our burthen, support well the load;</L>
<L>Up-hill work we shall have, and rough ways we shall find,</L>
<L>But, still jogging on, we shall leave them behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not, brave HAMLET, the rest of thy days</L>
<L>(With merit entitled to much better lays)</L>
<L>Shall be spent in hard work; or that in thy old age</L>
<L>Thou shalt gallop and trot, or shalt pant thro' a stage;</L>
<L>Faithful servants, like thee, should find rest at the last,</L>
<L>Not die in the harness, when labour is past;</L>
<L>A friend thou hast, HAMLET, a judge of true merit,</L>
<L>Who often hath prais'd both thy beauty and spirit;</L>
<L>Thy good points and temper to CRICKITT
<NOTE PLACE="foot">b C. ALEXANDER CRICKITT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> M. P. of Smyth's Hall, Essex.</NOTE> are known</L>
<L>His notice is gain'd, and his care will be shown—</L>
<L>SMYTH'S HALL will receive thee, whenever we part,</L>
<L>Those lovely rich meadows will cheer thy old heart;</L>
<L>From whip and spur free, thou shalt roll in fine clover,</L>
<L>Rejoicing, good HAMLET, thy labour is over—</L>
<L>Whilst I, not ambitious, nor greedy of pelf,</L>
<L>Some quiet retreat shall seek out for myself.</L>

<HEAD>THE PUDDING.</HEAD>

<L>YOU say, my dear <HI>Sally,</HI> I cannot tell why,</L>
<L>A stanza or two I could write, if I try,</L>
<L>Let the subject you give me be just what it may;</L>
<L>And that e'en on a <HI>Pudding</HI> I've something to say.—</L>
<L>A <HI>Pudding,</HI> sweet <HI>Sall,</HI> I can shew in a trice.</L>
<L>Is a subject, of which I wou'd fain have a slice.—</L>
<L>The <HI>World</HI> is a <HI>Pudding</HI> of ev'ry ingredient,</L>
<L>Where each his own palate may suit as expedient;</L>
<L>Some folks have indeed (for it must be confess'd)</L>

<L>While others expert, or more cunning or quick,</L>
<L>Contrive all the <HI>Plums</HI> and the <HI>Sweetmeats</HI> to pick:</L>
<L>Where I but to help them, and give each his share,</L>
<L>Good things they should have—but they all shou'd cut fair.—</L>
<L><HI>Hasty Pudding</HI> and <HI>Custard</HI> our <HI>Childhood</HI> befriend:</L>
<L><HI>Yorkshire Pudding</HI> and <HI>Dumpling</HI> in <HI>Youth</HI> we commend:</L>

<L>There's <HI>Custard,</HI> and <HI>Marrow,</HI> and <HI>Plum,</HI> and there's <HI>Tanzy,</HI></L>

<SIGNED><HI>King's Head, Rochester.</HI></SIGNED></OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LOVE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>BY old Rochester's Clock (and it was not yet dark)</L>
<L>'Twas a quarter past six, ere I saw Madam Clark—</L>
<L>Much she curtsey'd and drew herself up at the Door,</L>
<L>And thought you were coming i'th' old coach and four</L>
<L>With Children and Servants at least half a score—</L>
<L>"Mrs. Townley is well? and the dear little creatures?</L>
<L>"So lovely a Groupe! with such sweet pretty features!</L>
<L>"How many, pray Sir, is it now that you boast?</L>
<L>"Is it five, six, or seven, perhaps, at the most?"</L>
<L>While thus full of the Praises of all the sweet Boys,</L>
<L>She was presently stopp'd by a clattering and noise</L>
<L>Of Horses and Servants, with two or three Chaises;</L>
<L>The bar-bell she rings, and her shrill voice she raises;</L>
<L>'Twas "Ostler" and "Chambermaid" echo throughout,</L>
<L>And the Waiters are scampering and flying about;</L>
<L>While Jem with his Hamlet trots up to the Stable</L>
<L>And provides for himself then as well as he's able.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, my dear pretty Mary, methinks you will say,</L>
<L>"I wish my good Man, in a regular way,</L>
<L>"Would but tell me, in verse, all the Scenes of the Day."</L>
</LG>
<PB N="2" REF="45"/>
<LG>
<L>To please then my Love, though she laughs at my verse,</L>
<L>I will grant her request—and 'tis thus I rehearse—</L>
<L>My Horse, my good Hamlet! "scarce ever caught tripping,</L>
<L>"Who goes without Spur, and who never wants whipping,"</L>
<L>To the old City brought me—which I, in a banter,</L>
<L>For shortness in verse, and on <HI>Horseback,</HI> call <HI>Canter</HI>—</L>
<L>It had not sruck ten when I reach'd the Red Lion—</L>
<L>Within the three Hours! need I faster to hie on?—</L>
<L>Having fed my good Beast, tho' I just saw him dress'd,</L>
<L>I thought it but right I should give him some rest,</L>
<L>While I scrap'd well my face, and fresh powder'd my hair,</L>
<L>Since to see a new Client I strait must repair;</L>
<L>You know whom I mean, Mr. Cumming th' Attorney,</L>
<L>Whom I promis'd to call on i'th' course of my Journey;</L>
<L>Much he press'd me to dinner, and good Mrs. Cumming</L>
<L>Would fain give me Wine, or some Water, with Rum in;</L>
<L>But so fix'd was my Plan before night to see Rochester,</L>
<L>I refus'd all their Liquors, nay even their Dorchester;</L>
<L>Having weigh'd well the Case, and the Papers and Pleas,</L>
<L>And enlarg'd on the merits—and hinted at Fees,</L>
<L>I then took my leave; and, in going along,</L>
<L>I just paid a visit to old Mrs. Tong,</L>
<L>By whose clack call her Tongue—and you'll not name her wrong.</L>
<L>Tho' my stay there was short, too much time had I spent,</L>
<L>And to one Mr. —'s Mansion I went;</L>
<PB N="3" REF="46"/>
<L>Yet so great was my haste, he'd not <HI>press</HI> me to stay—</L>
<L>But hop'd the next time—to be out of the way.—</L>
<L>I went to the Church, to inspect the good Pew;</L>
<L>I must call it <HI>good,</HI> from the Place—and the Stew</L>
<L>Which my Client is in—who must have her own will,</L>
<L>And keep the Possession—as Grist to the Mill;</L>
<L>When her Case is but doubtful she's <HI>sure</HI> she is right,</L>
<L>And to hear all her reasons, would keep me all night—</L>
<L>I wish'd her success, since her Cause is but Justice,</L>
<L>But as to the <HI>Law</HI> sure too strong now her trust is.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As I look'd at my Watch, when my visits were done,</L>
<L>How great my Surprize, when I found it was <HI>one</HI>—</L>
<L>Have I spent the whole morning, within this old City?</L>
<L>'Tis a great deal to lose, and I'm sure 'tis a Pity,</L>
<L>As the days are much shorten'd, and draw in apace,</L>
<L>Besides I hate riding, as if for a race—</L>
<L>I return'd to the Inn, and I thought I could eat,</L>
<L>In a twinkling, a morsel of any cold meat—</L>
<L>My Landlady shew'd me boil'd beef and cold ham,</L>
<L>But I spied in the larder some nice ribs of lamb—</L>
<L>Bring 'em out—"Would you choose, Sir, to have a potatoe"?</L>
<L>Oh bravo! I'll eat it—'twill make me no later—</L>
<L>The stage was a long one—I'd breakfasted soon,</L>
<L>And had had a good ride, and 'twas now afternoon—</L>
<L>So I trust you'll agree with your Jemmy and say,</L>
<L>Take a snap while you can—it's the very best way—</L>
<PB N="4" REF="47"/>
<L>But first I should tell you, I happen'd to meet</L>
<L>A very old friend, as he pass'd in the street;</L>
<L>It was one you may know, not a female or hoyden;</L>
<L>But my friend Mr. Fuller, of Updown—and Croydon;</L>
<L>He kindly stay'd with me, and saw me devour</L>
<L>My cold ribs of lamb, i'th' fourth part of an hour—</L>
<L>We parted—I paid, and I mounted my Hamlet</L>
<L>And away from old Canter—to Sittingbourne amble it—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I reach'd Mrs. Fordred's, the farthest Red Lion,</L>
<L>Before five o'Clock—not so slow to cry, fye on—</L>
<L>I stay'd forty minutes, in sipping my tea,</L>
<L>Saw Hamlet well dress'd—and then gave him <HI>his</HI> Fee—</L>
<L>Refresh'd, I remounted, and reach'd the King's Head,</L>
<L>The time most exactly already you've read.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Day was delightful, sweet, pleasant and airy;</L>
<L>Not a Cloud to be seen, but on parting with Mary:</L>
<L>'Tis a little past ten, and I've eat some veal cutlet,</L>
<L>But you know that at night I don't wish much to guttle it,—</L>
<L>I will now go to bed, having scribbled, you see,</L>
<L>What perhaps may amuse you, as coming from <HI>me.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Love to good Uncle, Aunt, Babies and Bess;</L>
<L>Whom I cannot love more, and I should not love less,</L>

<HEAD><HI>RULES,</HI> To be observed at LITTLE SHERWOOD BALL, Prescribed, without Ceremony, by the Master of the Ceremonies, and extracted from the celebrated Work of FIGURINI.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN the Company is assembled, the Fans of the several Ladies are to be collected by the Master of the Ceremonies, and by him presented to the Gentlemen; and on each Gentleman's receiving a Fan, he shall accept it in the most respectful man∣ner, pointing the tip of it towards his Heart, and then, graceful∣ly returning it to the fair Owner, he shall dance with her two Dances.</P>
<P N="2">2. No Lady is to disown her Fan.</P>
<P N="3">3. If any Gentlemen from hurry of Spirits, Excess of Politeness, being left-handed, or otherwise aukward, should break, or in the least injure a Fan, he is the next Morning early to send the Lady a new one, and, by way of excuse, a Copy of Verses, every word being properly spelt. Copies of them afterwards, given to the Master of the Ceremonies, will be thankfully received, to form a choice Collection for future Assemblies here.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it is well known that much beauty and Sweetness of Man∣ners will grace the Assembly, every Gentlemen will doubtless observe the greatest Respect and Decorum on the Occasion, and
<PB N="2" REF="61"/>will not give rise to any Challenge, Quarrel or Misunderstand∣ing, so that no Gentleman need be provided with more than his usual <HI>two</HI> Cases of Pistols.</P>
<P N="5">5. Should there unexpectedly be a Duel, and the Gentleman who was not in the least the Aggressor, unfortunately <HI>fall,</HI> he shall be buried with the Honors of Love, the Ladies attending in white Crape Veils.</P>
<P N="6">6. Any Lady fainting, or appearing to faint, or saying she is sure she shall faint soon, the Master of the Ceremonies is to be called, but the Bell is not to be pulled down with ringing hastily for Assistance. Every Smelling Bottle may however be immediately offered, and sprinkling of Lavender Water, &amp;c. freely allowed.</P>
<P N="7">7. There will be a smart Supper provided, and the Ladies and Gentlemen will sit in Pairs; but if, through Necessity, they should sit pretty close, and a Gentleman through Politeness, should be <HI>very</HI> assiduous, in helping a Lady to the Wing of a Chicken, or a Merry Thought, and the Lady receive it with very peculiar Sweetness, the Gentleman is not to be <HI>certain</HI> the Lady is in Love with him; nor is the Lady to expect a Letter from him the next Morning declaring his tender Passion.</P>
<P N="8">8. Bon Mots, Sallies of Wit, agreeable Fancies, and Quaint Con∣ceits, will be well received. No doubt the Gentlemens' Repar∣tees will be correct and decorous.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="62"/>
<P N="9">9. It is recommended that no Lady, after her return Home, keep her Female Friend up above one Hour, in describing the smart Things said to her; or her Ideas of any particular Gentleman's particular Attention, &amp;c. but she may resume the Subject the very next Morning at eleven.</P>
<P N="10">10. This being the first, and a kind of Rehearsal of a Ball at Lit∣tle Sherwood, the Master of the Ceremonies hopes for the Indul∣gence of his Friends, as he does for the Pleasure of their Com∣pany again very soon, assuring them that whatever Praise is due, it belongs to the Lady of the Manor, Donna Isabella.</P>

<P>THE Master of the Ceremonies takes the earliest Op∣portunity of returning his courteous Thanks to the Ladies and Gen∣glemen who honored him with their Company last Night, and assures the Ladies that their elegant Appearance, attractive Beauty, charm∣ing Grace, and sweetness of Manners captivated him; and, in the gay and correct Deportment of the Gentlemen, he felt the highest Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Having a slight touch of the Gout he was prevented pursuing the Mazes of the Dance, or shewing a light fantastic Toe, as he could have wished.</P>

<HEAD>LITTLE LUCY'S DREAM</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>At BOARDING SCHOOL, The Night before a Ball.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WELL—I dreamt the Day arrived,—or rather the Night—and that the School Room was lighted up for the Ball— all the young Ladies were in their best Bibs and Tuckers, as my Grand Papa calls it—the <HI>Teachers</HI> had French Hats—the two Half-Boarders had laid out all the little Money their Parents al∣lowed them, to set themselves off; and the <HI>Dancing Master</HI> ap∣peared in a new Pair of white Silk Stockings; while my stately Governess was so rich in her Dress, we were more frightened at her than ever—nay, the first day we came, and were shewn into the Parlour, (never yet seen in disorder) was nothing to her Ap∣pearance at this time—Parents themselves were now respectful to a degree—and some of the little Children look'd up at her only once—the Maids, who were nearly worn out with fatigue, from having spent the whole day in dressing the young Ladies, stood, if the door was opened, peeping over each others shoulders to have a view of the brilliant Ball Room, and of our grand Gover∣ness—and ugly old Joseph, the Footman, had blacked his shoes so highly on the occasion, we thought they were japanned, besides having out a Frill, for the first time.—The Parents, the rich ones, of some of us, were seated on the best forms, with a few young
<PB N="2" REF="75"/>Bridlers they brought with them—I pitied the poor <HI>Writing Master,</HI> who, tho' he had two Daughters and a Niece there, and had mended the Pens, ruled the Books and rapped the Knuckles of the whole School for more than twenty Years, was obliged to stand behind, near the Door, because his Gait was rather awk∣ward, and his worked-white Sattin Waistcoat was still fresh, tho' not in itself, yet in every body's recollection on such days.—</P>
<P>Well, now, what do you think?—at this moment, as I dreamt, HARLEQUIN jumped into the room, over the little Orchestra, twirled round three times, tripped up the Dancing Master, flou∣rished his wooden Spatter, smacked the Grand Piano, and, in an instant, the School Room was turned into a large PASTRY COOK'S SHOP,—when Harlequin, frisking round, presented to the young Ladies, Tartlets, Cheesecakes, and Jellies; to the Half Boarders and Teachers, Pusss and whipt Syllabubs; to the Dan∣eing Master a Trisle; to the Writing Master a stale Bun; and to my Governess a rich Twelfth Cake.</P>
<P>Seeing so many nice things, and hastily reaching out my hand I gave my Bed-fellow such a Shove as awoke her and my∣self too.</P>

<HEAD>FAMILY PRESENTS. <HI>January</HI> 2, 1806.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the complaints you make of the plague and trouble which you have with your large family, owing to the want of that respect which our parents received from us, yet I think you would find some relief by <HI>purchasing,</HI> as it were, a readiness and civility in them, occasionally making your children presents of money or of different articles; to ex∣plain what I mean, I send you an account of what I recollect to have lately done for such purpose, and by way of inducing them to let the remainder of my life, spent in toil and anxiety to place them in the very comfortable situations in which they now are, pass away with some degree of satisfaction and repose.</P>
<P N="1">I. To my eldest Son an increase of Salary, on his appearing sorry when I was extremely ill.</P>
<P N="2">II. A shilling a-piece to each of the little children to induce them not to make so great a noise at that time—<HI>note</HI>—I found this had better been left alone, for they all laughed immoderately after it.—</P>
<PB N="2" REF="86"/>
<P N="3">III. To my second Son, thinking I might induce him to copy a short letter for me—a new Penknife.</P>
<P N="4">IV. My daughter being once quite ready in time to go to Church—a pair of Gloves.</P>
<P N="5">V. Having thought I often desired my Niece to go up stairs for me in the Christmas Week—an Almanack with the new Country Dances in it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A Present to all my Children on their Mother's Birth-day.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Putting my Wife in good humour when I had an old friend dined with me, and she said we had drank rather too much —a new Gown.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Half-a-Crown to my Daughter seeing her give Six-pence to a poor Woman very big with Child.</P>
<P>Same day—gave her a new Fan on her seeming much pleased when I came and sat in her Room, and for sweeping up the hearth, which she knew I liked.</P>
<P N="9">IX. To my Son Henry, after I had read a Copy of my own Verses to him, asking me to read them again, tho' rather long— <HI>Gil Blas</HI> neatly bound.—</P>
<P><HI>Unfinished.</HI></P>
