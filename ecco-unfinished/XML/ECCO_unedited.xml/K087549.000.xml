<HEAD><HI>HANOVER</HI> OR <HI>ROME,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE with great Pleasure ob∣serv'd the good Disposition of the sober and reasonable Part of the Kingdom on the Report of the Pretender's threatning Us with an Invasion. They seem to be animated with the same Spi∣rit as drove our last Popish King out of this Island, and will, I doubt not defend it against all Pretenders to the Dominion of it, which our Laws have settled on a Protestant Line, who are happily in Possession of it, and will most certainly maintain it, to the Confusion of all their Enemies.</P>
<P>The Abhorrance every honest thinking Man must have of an Invasion, supported by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Cut∣throats, by fugative Criminals, and beggarly desperate <HI>Tories,</HI> will doubtless increase in the Minds of all good
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Subjects, and have so good an Effect, as to make them judge with more Deliberation for the future, and not be imposed upon by the specious Pretences of those who call themselves the only <HI>True Sons of the Church,</HI> but are indeed the Sons of Sedition and Rebellion, and would save themselves from the Punishment they have justly deserv'd, by the Ruin of their Country and Religion.</P>
<P>Is there a Man of Common Sense in the Kingdom, who can flatter himself, That the Pretender would have it in his Power, if it was in his Will, to support the Church of <HI>England</HI> When his pretended Father was sent by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth to <HI>Ireland,</HI> had he not the Count <HI>de' Ava<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to attend him, on purpose to prevent his doing any thing in Favour of the Protestants of that Kingdom? Not that King <HI>James</HI> had the least Inclina∣tion of himself to be favourabe to them: But while there was a Party in <HI>England,</HI> who under the Deonmi∣nation of <HI>Church of</HI> England - Men, promoted on all Occasions his, and the Popish Interest; some of his Councellors as the Lord <HI>Powis,</HI> the Lord <HI>Dover,</HI> &amp;c. advis'd him, tho' they were Pepists, to be more Gra∣cious to the Protestants: But the <HI>French</HI> Minister would allow of nothing but Plundering, Murdering; nothing but Fire and Sword, Rapes and Racks, would satisfy the <HI>French</HI> Counsellers he brought from <HI>France</HI> with him. Nay. 'tis Observable. That the <HI>French</HI> King obliged him to take the very Officers with him, whom he him∣self had made use of on the like Employment, Monsieur <HI>Maman,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Rosen,</HI> who were the very Men that were sent to <HI>Languedos</HI> to Dragoon the <HI>French</HI> Protestants, to Pluuder and Spoil their Houses, Ravish their Wives and Daughters, Torture themselves, their Fathers and Sons; and commit Cruelties which are not to be parallel'd in all the Histories of the Bloody Pagan Persecutions.</P>
<P>I know it will be objected, That we assert without Proof; Thus the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> while King <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
was destroying the Protestanes in <HI>Ireland,</HI> asserted. That the latter liv'd in the full Enjoyment of their Liberties and Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perties; and that all the Reports of their be∣ing Robb'd and Murder'd were groundless and malicious They will now doubtless treat our just Apprehensions of the like Usage from his pretended son, as Visionary and Chimerical. They will tell us of the fair Things he Promises in his Declarations, and especially of his good Will to the Clergy, whom he is to declare <HI>Independent of the State,</HI> as <HI>Lesley</HI> Writes in one of his treasonable Letters. They will not look back to the barbarous and arbitrary Conduct of <HI>James</HI> IId. to his breach of Laws and Faith; They will insist upon our trusting to the Word of his pretended Son; and putting our Selves, our Religion and Estates, entirely into his Hands, and let him do with Us, as he, and his <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Councel∣lors shall think fit. What then can we expect from a Person, who from an Infant has been instructed to look upon us as a Rebellious Heretical Nation, devoted to De∣struction, as soon as the Papists could effect it? What can we expect from one who has been told, that the Crown of these Kingdoms is his Birth-right, and that he has been unjustly kept our of it by his Slaves; that he has been forc'd to live on the Charity of the <HI>French King,</HI> when the Revenues of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are his Due; to which, <HI>they say,</HI> he has as good a Title as ei∣ther of us has to his House or Land? Will he be more careful of our Church, and our Properties, then King <HI>James</HI> was.</P>
<P>Will he who never knew what it was to live in a Coun∣try where Liberty was heard of, or where it was treated otherwise than as Rebellion and Faction, be more ten∣der of our Constitution than our abdicated King; who after having taken so many Oaths to maintain it, gave it up, not only to his own Will, but the Will of his Benefactor, the <HI>French</HI> King? King <HI>James</HI> had a Potent Adversary in King <HI>William,</HI> and a Powerful People to struggle with, after he had invaded <HI>Ireland.</HI> It was
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
therefore good Policy in him to temporize at least with the Protestants; yet such was his, and his Protector's the <HI>French</HI> King's Inveteracy to them, that contrary to good Policy, he suffer'd his <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Soldiers to use them worse than ever Dragoons of <HI>France</HI> treated the <HI>Hugmiots.</HI> What must we look for then from the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI> to the Throne he Abdicated, when by an <HI>Irish, French,</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> Power he has possest himself of the So∣vereignty, when he has no <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>German</HI> League to fear, when we have no Deliverer to have Recourse to; when the <HI>French</HI> King, being strengthned by the Alliance of a Popish Prince in <HI>Britain,</HI> shall give Laws not only to him but all <HI>Europe,</HI> what will our Revolution be term'd, and all the Acts subsequent to it? Every Man that has paid a Penny to support the War-against <HI>France</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> will be deem'd Guilty of high Treason. In a word, every P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>testant that has a Penny to lose, will be a Traytor and Reoel, and he that has not, lie at the Mercy of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Murderers. It cannot be otherwise; and yet how are the stupid and blind Po∣pulace hurry'd on by Faction to contribute to the Ru∣in of that Holy Church for which they affect so much Zeal? Can any one belive that the <HI>French</HI> King will suffer the Impostor to be less dependant on him than King <HI>James</HI> was? That after he has Subsisted him Seven and Twenty Years, and been at Twenty or Thirty Mil∣lions Charge about his pretended Father, Mother, Him∣self and their followers, that he will let him be any thing better than his Viceroy, or ever leave him so much Authority as one of his Lievtenant-General of a Province of <HI>France?</HI> And what must they think will be the Consequence of our being subjected to the Ty∣ranny of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV? Will he forgive our reducing him to a Condition when he scarce thought himself safe at <HI>Versaills;</HI> the many hundred Millions he has expend∣ed, and the many Disgraces that his Arms were attend∣ed with? Will he pardon us for robbing him of the Glorious Tittle of <HI>Ever Victorious?</HI> Whill he spare us, that spares not his own Natural Subjects? Will he content
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
himself with our Estates and Liberties? Shall our Re∣ligion and Lives be left us, and shall Beggery and Sla∣very attone for Heresy? Will he not exti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pate us as an Heretical, Stubborn, perverse People, and not suf∣fer us to be on the same sad Terms with one of his own miserable Provinces? Must not the Pretender owe all to him; and what can hinder his recovering the Debt with a word of his Mouth, of ever we should be so wretched as to come into Subjection to him.</P>
<P>As there is nothing that gives a more lively Idea of things, than Instances of the like which have happen'd before, I shall take from a very credible Author, a Clergy man, a Passage releating to the History of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> when King <HI>James</HI> was there; and from thence may we reasonably conclude, what a Shadow of a Prince the <HI>French</HI> King intends the Impostor shall be.</P>
<P>Before King <HI>James</HI> left <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> oblig'd him to Covenant with him that the <HI>French</HI> should be put into Possession of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and all the places of Strength in <HI>Ireland:</HI> Accordingly, on the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> 1683. Three Battalions of <HI>French</HI> enter'd the City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Lauzun</HI> their General sent to Collonel <HI>Lutterel</HI> the Governour to deliver the Keys of the City and Ca∣stle; <HI>Lutterel</HI> answer'd, he would first acquaint the King, which he did, taking the Lord Mayor and Alder∣men with him; the Governour and his Popish Attend∣ants told him, <HI>They had hitherto ventur'd their Lives and Fortunes in his Defence, and therefore hoped he would still en∣trust them with the Government of</HI> Dublin, <HI>and not give the</HI> French <HI>an Absolute Authority over them.</HI> To whom he reply'd, <HI>That he was engag'd to his Brother of</HI> France, <HI>to give the Government of</HI> Dublin <HI>to the Count de</HI> Lauzun, <HI>and could not recide from it.</HI> Upon which, the <HI>French</HI> General had the Keys of the City delivered to him▪ but <HI>Lauzun</HI> would not let the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers mount the Guard till he had the Keys of the Castle, and the next Day they also were brought to him. After this, the <HI>French</HI> very
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
commonly swore. <HI>They had no King but King</HI> Lewis, <HI>and would obey no Orders but the Count</HI> de Lauzun's, <HI>and they grew so insolent to the</HI> Irish <HI>as well as</HI> English, <HI>that the Pa∣pist themselves frequently complain'd of them to King</HI> James, <HI>but con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d never have any Redress,</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Reverend Author says farther, “The <HI>French</HI> had not been Two Days in <HI>Dublin,</HI> when they Murder'd Two or Three Protestant Clothiers in a part of that City call'd the <HI>Comb,</HI> for that great Crime of Protect∣ing their Wive from being made Prostitutes to their Lust; of which inhuman Act no Notice was ever ta∣ken, tho King <HI>James</HI> was complained to about it. About the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, some of them took a Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, who came to Market with her Father, and Ra∣vished her in the open Street at Noon-Day. Many suen barbarous pieces of Villany were perpetrated by them; and their Leaders moved in Council, that the City should be Burnt if they could not keep it; whereupon the <HI>Irish</HI> City Papists, and those of the Army, apply'd themselves to King <HI>James,</HI> represent∣ing to him, That the Catholicks would be great suf∣ferers by that as well as the Ptotestants, and they humbly and earnestly intreated him not to give way” to any such Council.</Q></P>
<P>It would be endless if I should go about to produce Examples of the Superiority of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the barbarous and bloody Use they made of it. What need is there of Proof by Fact? The Reason of the Thing is its own Evidence; and wherever the Preten∣der prevails, he Acts in entire subordination to his Be∣nefactor, and must be as much a Slave to his Will, as the Poor deluded <HI>Britons</HI> must be to his. Is the Impo∣stor worth a Great of his own; has he a Fishing Boat, has he a Footman, but what he must buy, and subsist by the <HI>French</HI> King's Alms? And whatever Artifice the <HI>French</HI> Court may make use of to colour their Actions, with whatever Evasions they may excuse the Assistance
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
they give him, it is impossible for him to Arm and Maintaine a Company of Foot, or hire a <HI>Bilander</HI> to Transport him to <HI>Britain,</HI> without he is assisted direct∣ly or indirectly by the <HI>French.</HI> His pretended Father King <HI>James</HI> was to have deliver'd up <HI>Portsmouth, Pilmouth</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> before he went from <HI>England,</HI> for the Supplies of Men and Ships Monsieur <HI>Bonrepos</HI> offer'd him in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> King his Master. Now if <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth cou'd demand Three such Towns in <HI>England</HI> of King <HI>James,</HI> when he was upon his Throne, and had not an Enemy in Arms against him in the Three Kingdoms, what will he not exact of his pretended Heir, for the Supply he furnishes him with? What less than the Three Kingdoms will content him? How could all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> prevent their falling into his Hands? These Considerations are so natural, so ob∣vious, and withal so terrible and affecting, that they need no Exaggeration. Every Reader will tremble at the Thought; and let this just Terror so alarm him, as to animate him to a vigorous Defence of the Invalu∣able Blessings we now Enjoy, in a <HI>Protestant</HI> King and <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Having shewn that it will not be left in the Preten∣der's Power to secure our Holy Church from the Per∣secution of Papists, and <HI>French</HI> Idolaters; I might now argue, that it will not be his Will, that he would not do it if he could, that his fair Speeches are more Gri∣mace than those of his pretended Father to the Privy Council and Parliament, on his Accession to the Throne. But sure such a Task is needless. It cannot be ima∣gin'd that a Creature of the <HI>French</HI> King's, Taught from his Childhood to look on the Protestants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as in a damnable Heresy; and to hold that no Faith is to be kept with them, when the Interests of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are concern'd: I say it can't be imagin'd that such a person will ever have the least for∣bearance with such an Heretical Generation as he deems the Church of <HI>England</HI> Protestants to be, but will fol∣low
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the Example as well as the Instruction of his Protect∣or, in rooting out our Religion, and restoring the Papal Tyranny in this Kingdom When his Factitious Father was once apply'd to by Colonel <HI>Sarsfield</HI> to give a Com∣mission to a Kinsman of his, who was a Protestant, for whose Fidelity the Colonel offer'd to be Bound: He reply'd, <HI>He would trust no Church of</HI> England <HI>Man</HI> And a little while after, comming from Chapel, he said to some Countiers, who were talking of the Protestants, <HI>That they Stunk in his Nostrils.</HI> If they were so Offensive to him who had his Breeding among them, who had been one himself, and own'd his Conversion only to the Arguments of that rare Casu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Colonel <HI>Richard Talbot,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> as the latter bragg'd when he was his Deputy in <HI>Ireland;</HI> What Offence must they give to the Impostor who has been bred up under a <HI>Confessor, Queen Mary</HI> of <HI>M. dena,</HI> the greatest Bigot to Popery in <HI>Christendome?</HI> One may suppose how kind he would be to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> King's Kindness to his own Protestants. But our Con∣dition must be worse; we cou'd not be banish'd for Re∣ligion, <HI>Lewa</HI> wou'd be every where Master; all <HI>Europe</HI> must follow the Fate of <HI>England;</HI> there wou'd be no Country left to receive us, or our Relligion wou'd be left to no Country. <HI>Galleys, Gibbets, Whips,</HI> and <HI>Wheels,</HI> all that <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Cruelty and Revenge cou'd in∣vent must necessarily be our Lot Poverty and want wou'd be the least of our Plagues; we shou'd think our selves happy to preserve our Religion at the Price of all other Blessings, at least, if there remain'd Virtue and Conscience among us. But alas! we must be Poor, we must be slaves, we must be Idolatrous; or be Rack'd, be Slaughter'd, and the very Name of <HI>Enlishman</HI> and Protestant be lost for ever. That the Pretender wou'd treat you thus, if you were Subject to him, is not to be doubted, from the Spirit and Practice of his Protec∣tor. Can he possess himself of Three Kingdoms by the help only of his <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> Fugitives? Suppose it were possible, as it is not, that he cou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecucd us by
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
as small a Band of Followers, as the Duke of <HI>Monmonth,</HI> join'd by the Giddy Riotous Rabble which is the Best of his Pretences; when his Work was done, wou'd not Friendship, Gratitude; Religion and Interest, bind him fast to the French King? Wou'd not our Strenth and Riches be quickly made the Instruments to bring all People, especially Protestants, into the same dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣able Circumstances as our selves.</P>
<P>About a Year ago there was a Report industriously spread in <HI>England,</HI> that the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enner was turn'd Pro∣testant; is was also rumour'd Three Years ago, and that vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Wretch <HI>Roper</HI> Printed it for News, that <HI>Loslcy</HI> was gone to Convert him, to hinder our being troubled with <HI>Come overs.</HI> When this Report had prevail'd over some thoughtless credulous Tories, and they began to give Credit to it, lest the <HI>Papists</HI> of the Three Kingdoms, on whom the <HI>French</HI> King makes his Dependance, shou'd be discorag'd by such a Rumour, it was presently De∣clar'd in the <HI>Paris Gazette,</HI> that it was groundless, and that the Impostor disown'd any such Conversion. <HI>Loslcy</HI> goes farther in one of his Treasonable Papers, and says, <HI>He is resolved not to deceive his good Subjects, by telling them he has renounced Popery; on the Contrary, he as∣sures them he never will,</HI> And that Tory Priest argues, that 'tis for the Interest and Security of the Protestant Religion that he never should. For, <HI>continues that Ireshman,</HI> If he owns himself a Protestant, the Church <HI>of - England - Men</HI> would think themselves secure, and not to be on their Guard against Popery, which he might still privately Encourage, if not openly Counte∣nance, under the Colour of <HI>Protestantism;</HI> whereas, if he was a Papist, the least Step he took in their Favour would be observ'd with more Jealousiy. Thus argues that <HI>Irish</HI> Missionary.</P>
<P>And what if it were Observ'd! What if he serv'd all the Colleges in <HI>England,</HI> as his pretended Father did that of <HI>Magdalen</HI> in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and all the Churches as he
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
serv'd <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the rest of the Pro∣testant Churches in <HI>Ireland?</HI> What if he cook away all the Privileges of one, and all the Worship of the other? The deluded enslave'd People must not resist, and if they did resist, what would Resistance signify, when he had the Power of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> supported by that of <HI>France</HI> to maintain him in his Abitrary and Cruel Government. What Benefit would it be for the <HI>Britons</HI> to perceive that he intended to make them Slaves, Beggars, and I∣dolaters, if They shou'd Turn, and become such Pa∣pists as the Converts of <HI>France:</HI> Would that save their Liberty and Property? Must they not be Slaves still, be first ruin'd in this World, and D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn'd in the next?

This too would be one of the least of their Sufferings; the remaining Portion of their Estates would be held precariously, and sujected to grievous Taxes by Proclamation, a Practice set up by King <HI>James</HI> after his Abdication. Their Persons, as well as Estates, would be Subject to the Will of a Po∣pish Tyrant, and this now Happy and Flourishing Nati∣tion be reduc'd to the utmost Distress and Desolation.</P>
<P>I have in several Places of this Discourse, made men∣tion of King <HI>James</HI>'s Conduct in <HI>Ireland,</HI> because he was there in almost the same Circumstances as his pretend∣ed Heir would be in <HI>England.</HI> With this Difference however, that the Latter would have less Restraint up∣on him, and no Body to please but his Friend and Pa∣tron the <HI>French</HI> King; whereas King <HI>James</HI> had a Party in <HI>Great Britain</HI> to impose upon, by pretensions of Fa∣vour to the Protestants, and yet under that Restraint did he deal worse with them, both with respect to their Liberties and Properties, than ever the <HI>French</HI> dealt by his Subjects, He put Copper on them for Silver, by one Proclamation dated the 4th of <HI>February,</HI> 1689. He seiz'd upon their most Merchantable Commodities, by another Proclamation of the same Date. And the very same Day publish'd another to levy a Tax on them of 10000 <HI>l.</HI> a Month. Here are Three Laws of his own making, more Despotick, and more invading on Pro∣perty, than any Edict the <HI>French</HI> King ever publish'd. Instead of Acts of Parliament, your Money would be forc'd from you by Order and Commands. Instead of a House of Commons, you would be Taxed by <HI>Irish</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Commissioners; and instead of Collectors, your Taxes would be levy'd by Granadiers and Dragoons. For whatever our abdicated King did after his Abdication, will most certainly be refined upon by his pretended Heir; and all his Maxims, all his Measures be impro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d, to advance one of the most grievous and destructive Tyrannies, by which a Free and Christian, Constitution was ever subverted.</P>

Friends by the Resentment and Disregard of our Gover∣nors: They will be ready enough to change their Tone when the Danger is over: They will find a hun∣dred Excuses for their Malignity and Indifference: They will have Proofs to bring you of, an extraordinary Zeal against the Impostor and his Abettors, They will disown their De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inquence, or Neutrality But let it not avail them; let us all have an Eye on such dangerous or in∣significant <HI>Britons;</HI> and let every true Lover of the Church and Liberty, signalize his Loyalty to the King, and his Zeal for our Religion, at this important Jun∣cture. Our All is at Stake, if the <HI>Pretender</HI> comes among us; and to be Lukewarm and Wary, when we have no other Chance to preserve it but the preservation of the Government, denotes the most fatal Stupidity; and that we are unworthy the Deliverance which providence sent Us a Second Time in King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Accession to the Throne.</P>
<P>If any where I have seem'd to be aprehensive of an Ivasion from the Pretender and his <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>French Cut-Throats,</HI> it is not an Apprehension that rises from Fear of the Success of such an Attempt, while we have so great and so good a King to protect us, and so Wise and so Loyal a Parliament to support Him. There is no In∣stance in Story that ever a Constitution so well esta∣blish'd was subverted. But that should be so far from rendring us too secure, that it should animate us all to exert our selves to chastise the Insolence of those Inva∣ders, and their Abettors; and to take hold of this Oc∣casion to suppress that Faction for ever, by putting the Laws in Force against them in Execution, with the Se∣verity that such Robbers and Rioters deserve.</P>
<P>Since His Majesty came to the Crown, He has not done one Act of Government but what ought to have gained the Hearts of all His Subjects, for whose Good he did it: His Conduct has been like a true Father of his Country; and I defy the most inveterate, the most in∣terested
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> to Name me one Instance in his Reign, where has not appear'd so much Good∣ness and Clemency, as ought to render Him as much the Delight of the <HI>Britons,</HI> as <HI>Titus</HI> was of the <HI>Romans.</HI> This I say, out of the Fulness of my Soul, and no Mo∣tive of Flattery or Expectation of Advantage. I never made any by any Government, and should have a mean Opinion of my self, if I should Embark in a Publick Quarrel for Privat Interest only. I know it gives a laudable Spirit to certain <HI>Genins</HI>'s: And I, for my own Part, matter not from what Motive another Man serves the Government, if he does it any Service: But since all the World are not so Complaisant, since they have more <HI>Delicacy,</HI> and will have every Present that's made them, come from the purest Hands; I thought fit to own to them, that I spake from the same honest Principle from which I sollicite them to Act, and with a fix'd Purpose to do in every Thing, what I wou'd have done on this emergent Occasion, as for as it lies in my Power: My Zeal is not affected or mercenary; the Cause is the Most Glorious and Necessary that a Peop'e can have. There is nothing so valuable that can be put in the Balance, with any Weight against it.</P>
<P>Let us now defend our Soveraign's Rights and our own, with the Courage and Fidelaty worthy the Name of <HI>Britons</HI> and Protestants and we shall secure our selves against the Insults of Faction. It was high Time to put an End to it by the utmost Rigour of the Law, and the full Strength of the Arm of Justice, before the Impo∣stor threatned to disturb us. But these arrogent Threats of his show, that the Mobs and Riots, by which we have been alarm'd lately, have really been so many Attempts in his Favour. The <HI>Rebels</HI> that have Burnt the Meet∣ing Houses, made the Church a Pretence only. Does the Church encourage or allow of such Wickedness? Is Drunkenness a Token of Zeal, and Curses a Sign of Devotion? Can one suppose that these Villains meant
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
any Thing more than to make a Tryal of their Strength, to see what Numbers they could get together, and what Encouragement they could give the Pretender by it, to put himself at their Head. We may depend up∣on it, Religion was no more in their Intention than in their Practice, and that they were his Forlorn Hope, which we ought to have fall'n upon, and cut off in their Rise; and to have had no more Mercy for those Incen∣diaries than for so many <HI>Banditti</HI> Men, or <HI>Rapparees.</HI></P>
<P>The only Objection that the hottest <HI>Tory</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> can make to King <HI>George</HI>'s Government, is the <HI>Change of the Ministry.</HI> Not to insist on the Arguments made use of by themselves, when Queen <HI>Ann</HI> chang'd Her Ministers, every one of which is much stronger in the Case of King <HI>George;</HI> I will appeal to the Conscience of even such a <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ry,</HI> Whether he does not verily belive that <HI>Oxford, Bo∣lingbroke, H—t,</HI> &amp;c. where His Majesty's Ene∣mies? Whether those that made the late scandalous and ruinous Peace, were not Friends to <HI>France,</HI> and con∣sequently to the <HI>Pretender?</HI> And whether such Men were proper to be trusted by his Present Majesty? Men whom we now see impeach'd of the most horrid Treasons a∣gainst their Queen and Country. Do they not own the Charge by running from their Tryal? If it be said that they run from a <HI>Majority;</HI> can one think they would run without carrying their Guilt along with them? Who can be safer than in the Judgment of the Parlia∣ment of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> What can Influence the Voice of so August an Assembly, but the Necessity of doing Justice to an injur'd Nation? Are not the Facts made Plain in the <HI>Report of the Committee of Secrecy?</HI> Was not the Peace treated of with <HI>Mesnager</HI> at first, without a∣ny Watrant from the Queen? And did not our Minist∣ers, and our General, Act in Concert with the <HI>French,</HI> before the Peace was concluded, and while we were bound by Honour, Interest and many solemn Treaties to Act in Concert with our Allies? Was not this to betray their Country, and their Queen, in both Coun∣cil
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and Action? Is not to <HI>Betray, Treason?</HI> And shall another Prince, who was Himself-Injur'd and Affront∣ed by them, trust those Traytors?</P>
<P>There is not a Tory in <HI>Britain,</HI> but when he divests himself of Passion and Pique, when he thinks sericusly of the Condition we were in before the Peace, and the Condition we are now in; there is not a Tory in <HI>Britain,</HI> however outragious he may be for the Loss of his Place, or his Pension, but does himself be∣live that those <HI>Ministers</HI> deserve the Punishment from which they fly; and I do not in this <HI>beg the Quest∣ion,</HI> it being a <HI>Maxim</HI> as old as <HI>Politicks,</HI> that those that <HI>Love the Treason, Hate the Trayter.</HI> Yet the disgrace of the <HI>Parricide</HI> and his Brethren, was made use of to Co∣lour the Outrage of the Rebble, spirited up by the <HI>Ja∣cobites;</HI> and the Doke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was huzza'd out of the Kingdom by the very Rabble that pretended to support him When a Man by his Weakness or Vanity has made his Name Dangerous to the publick Peace; it is safest for him to run that Country where he has been the oc∣casion of so much Uproar and Mischief: For to sup∣pose he did not Countenance and Reward them, is as foolish as to have done it. There were a thousand ways for him to have disown'd them and he took not one of them, but suffer'd the poor thoughtless Wretches to make use of his Name in their Riors, without any manner of Reproof. Whatever it is for himself, 'tis surely best for his Country that such a Man shoud be out of it.</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this Head, the Change of the Ministers, because it is the only one which the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> can take any handle of since his Majesty's coming to the Crown, to object by it to his Government. And how reasonable, how necessary it was to change them, is obvious to every Man of common Sense. Since there∣fore their Disaffection is so ill-grounded, and so Un∣grateful, may we not assure our selves that Creatures who are guilty of so much Folly and Ingratitude, are for any further Mischief, and ready to contribute to

Can we be safer than in an Army rais'd by King and Parliament for our Defenc? Is there the least Shadow of Reason for the vain Object∣ions of those that wou'd terrify us with the ill Conse∣quence of a <HI>Standing Iorce?</HI> Has not the Parliament limited the Term of their Pay to a Year, and will they pay them longer than they think them of absolute Ne∣cessity? Are not these Forces to be Commanded by a General and other Officers, who have been fighting for Liberty these Twenty Years and more; Disgrac'd and Injur'd by the late Ministers, purely because they would not fall in with their Measures to Enslave us, by de∣stroying the Balance of Power, and giving up all to <HI>France?</HI> Do these Toties, who affect such an extraordi∣nary Concern for Liberty, when they rail against our Army, really believe that the <HI>Whigs,</HI> whom they have charg'd from the beginning with <HI>Commonwealth</HI> Princi∣ples, intend to destroy our free Constitution, and Esta∣blish an Arbitrary Government? Or can they imagine that a Prince whose Vir'ue is as much fear'd by his Ene∣mies as his Power, will break in upon those Laws which he is come to defend, and which he has so often and so solemnly declear'd he will maintain? Or that a Prince who Govern'd his other Dominions, before his Accession to this Crown, where his Government was not confin'd by <HI>Statutes,</HI> with so much Justice and Clemency wou'd change his Conduct in his new Kingdom? What Folly, what Madness, has possest these men? They renounce Truth and Reason, as well as <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> when they commence Tories; and sure it will never be our hard Fate to be Ruin'd by such Madmen and Fools!</P>
<P>Had not the Pretender presum'd to threaten to Invade us, had he not got an Army together for that purpose? Does not the General Corruption that appears among the
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
inferior Clergy, and from them desends to the meaner part of the People, make it absolutely necessary to <HI>Strenthen the King's Hands</HI> with a∣nother Force, if the Civil is deficient. The Risings of the Rabble are like the Irruptions of the Sea, the Breaches are easily made up at first, but they spread if neglected, and fre∣quently become too powerful to be repell'd by common Methods. That the Civil Magistrates have been Remiss in the Discharge of their Trusts in <HI>Lancashire Saffordshire,</HI> and other Pla∣ces, is too notorious to need any Evidence. Where they have acted, they have been insult∣ed, heaten, and wounded. The Rioters have impudently own'd, and in some Corners Pro∣clam'd the Pretender; to speak of whom, as of their King, is Treason; and shall us suffer his Majesty's Title to be affronted at the Plea∣sure of every draken Mob? If they grow too strong for the <HI>Civil Arms,</HI> shall we not make use of the <HI>Military?</HI> Is not his Majesty's Cause more our own than His? He can be Great and Happy without us; and without Him we are Slaves and Beggars for ever. Shall we bear a∣ny longer with the foul Mouths of a debauch'd and insolent Populace? Shall we see our peac∣full Neighbours have their Houses plunder'd and burnt by them, and not lend our Assistance to prevent it? And how can it be done effect∣ually, but by being on our Guard against Fore∣ing Force, which those Rebels will always be

inviting over till they are crush'd, and the Fact∣ion so suppress'd as not to dare to murmur a∣gainst the Government that protects them, had there been one Man in the Three Kingdoms a sufferer by it in his Property or Liberty, contra∣ry to the known Laws of the Nation, Had there Prerogative been strech'd beyond the Bounds, or had our Church been betray'd in its Rights and Privileges, tho' that would not excuse the Violence of those Non-Riesisting Rebels, yet it would give some Pretence to their Fury where∣as now they have none but the Title of the Im∣postor to assert, which is Treason; and we can∣not give too much nor do too much to root out all those Traytors, that have giv'n their Coun∣try so much Disturbance, and been the Occa∣sion of a New Expence, the most Necessary that this nation were ever at for the Maintenance of their Liberties and Properties.</P>
<P>How long did the Government forbear with the Offenders? They wou'd not see their Crimes, in hopes they wou'd repent of it, and be reclaim'd of themselves; instead of which they grew more and more Insolent, and turn'd the Arms they rais'd against <HI>Presbytery,</HI> against the <HI>Constitution.</HI> When they found the Justices of Peace, Mayors of Towns, Constables, and Others, who at first might by a vigorous Oppo∣sition have easily suppress'd and punish'd them, were lazy and negligent, or rather perfidious

<P>Till the Militia is throughly reform'd, and the Command of them given every where to Men of Fidelity and Courage, it would be an unacountable Folly in us not to Rejoyce at a better Security provided for us by King and Parliament, and to sleep safely under the Guard of a great Force at Sea and Land sufficient to repel all <HI>Foreign</HI> Enemies, and to support the Execution of Justice on the <HI>Domestick.</HI></P>

Had the Government in pursuance of Trea∣ties, apply'd for Assistance of Allies Abroad, before we were arm'd at Home; what Clamour would have been made against bringing in <HI>Dutchmen</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> tho' both <HI>Germans and Dutchmen</HI> are much better Friends to <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> than the <HI>Tories</HI> are.

In a word, they are not at all afraid of suffering by the Force that is rais'd in either their Rights or Liberties, but that it will hinder others suffering by their Faction and Fury; and the more they are griev'd at it. the more have we Reason to be glad. Every Thing that displeases the Friends of the Pre∣tender, is surely Matter of Joy to the Friends of the Constitution, which is inconsistant with the Impostor's Claim.</P>

Charge, after the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Peace,</HI> as they call it, was concluded. And shall we grutch so small an Expence, to preserve our Church; our Li∣berty, our Estates, our All, which the Late Parliament and Ministry exceeded to maintain the Authority of those Ministers which had brought every Thing into Danger from a State of the greatest <HI>Security,</HI> We spent above a Hun∣dredred Millions to <HI>reduce the Exorbitant Power of</HI> France, and in a just and necessary War, and the Late Traiterous Ministers by an Infamous peace made that <HI>Power</HI> more <HI>Exorbitant</HI> than e∣ver it was before the War. Shall we think much of a Hundredth Part of that Expence to deliv∣er us from the Peril they brought us into. We are sure that what is given will be apply'd to those Uses. That it will be manag'd by Men of Integrity and Capacity, and not by a <HI>Sot</HI> void of Experience, Application, and Honesty. We know that it is for our own Sakes that the Go∣vernment is oblig'd to be at an extraordinary Charge; and that there is no other Way to se∣cure to us our Lands, our Funds, our Goods, and even our Bread. Shall we think much of parting with a Trifle to secure the whole? No surely, I trust there is not a True Protestant in <HI>Briton,</HI> but would be willing to go through the last immense Charge of a War, rather than be a Slave to <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> GOD be thank'd, there will be no Occasion of such an Expence, in Case we are zealous and watch∣ful

<P>What a Prospect of Security and Glory have we behind the little Cloud that now hangs o∣ver us, which will infallibly fall on our Ene∣mies, if we are faithful and resolute in the Righteous Cause of our <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Country?</HI> There is nothing that ought to discourage us in the Defence of it: We have a victorious Fleet and Army, commanded by Faithful and Fortunate Generals and Admirals, whose good Fortune was but the just Reward of their Va∣lour and Conduct. We have the Strength, the Riches of our Country, on our Side. We have the Religion, and the Virtue; but above all, we have that GOD, who has within our Me∣mories wrought Two wonderful Deliverances for us; the First from King <HI>James</HI>'s Tyranny, and the Second from that of the Late Ministers. What have the Pretender and his Abettors to Support them, but the Purse and Power of a betten beggar'd King who disowns his Pretences, and dars not assist him, but in Pri∣vat, and by Stelth? Who are his Generals and Counsellors, but Criminals and Fugitives; who are desperate enough to chuse rather to Die in the Field than on the Scaffold and Gib∣bet: The sad Choice which their Guilt has
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
left them. As for the <HI>Mobs</HI> and <HI>Riots</HI> we have lately seen and heard of; it is not to be doubted but the <HI>Faction</HI> made their utmost Ef∣forts to gather as great Numbers together as they could raise, by Drunkenness and Mutiny. And what has all their terrible Inserrections ammounted to, 4 or 500 loose fellows at a Time, enough to do Mischief to People un∣arm'd; but who, at the sight of a Squadron of Dragoons, no more Numerous than <HI>Harley</HI>'s Squadron of Peers, would fly to their Holes and Hovels, from the Hands of the Hangman and Beedle.</P>
<P>We may depend upon it, that this Attempt of the <HI>Impostor</HI> is the Effect of Despair in Him∣self and his Followers. They conclude from the first Year of his Majesty's Reign, that thro' the whole Course of it, his Subjects will have Reason to bless Heaven for so good and so gracious a Soveraign; that his Virtue will triumph over Faction, and his deluded Ene∣mies return with Shame and Remorse to their Duty: That then their will be nothing left for them but Want, Disgrace, and Misery, that like <HI>Cain</HI> they will be mark'd out to be avoid∣ed and detested by all Mankind; and that they had better die in Battle than in Jayls: For they have nothing before them but all the Cur∣ses that attend Traytors to their King and their Country. Shall we be afraid of such

Vagabonds, headed by a Creature of the <HI>French</HI> King's, who knows less of his Beginning than he seems to do of his End? I cannot sup∣pose that our ill Usage under the last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inistey, did in so short a Time dispirit us in such Man∣ner, as to render us more base and dastardly than our Ancestors. <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> had another guess Mob at his Heels than the Imposter is like to have, no less than 100,000 Men, and all with∣in the City of <HI>London,</HI> yet did the Lord-Mayor and his Followers only disperse them in an In∣stant, when they came to a firm Resolution to oppose them to the utmost. <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> was another sort of a <HI>Pretender</HI> than the Chevalier <HI>de St. George,</HI> he was assisted by the <HI>French</HI> King, by the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> then almost as Great as the <HI>French</HI> King, by the <HI>Scots</HI> King, at that Time a formidable Enemy to <HI>England</HI> when she had any other. He had also another Name to pretend to, that of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> a Royal Race Famous for Heroes. He had a Mob to assist him as well as all these Princes. He landed, and march'd his Army a Hundred Miles in the Coun∣try; but what was his Fortune, the Stocks first the Pillory next, and the Gallows at last. There was no Hundred Thousands for his Head. He had liv'd in the Court of <HI>France</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgundy,</HI> as a King; and his Guards and Officers, and some half witted beggarly <HI>English</HI> Lords to follow him.

<P>There never was as an Impostor that came not to a miserable End, however for a Time he might seem to flourish; And it would be a hard Case, if we who had beat his Pro∣tector the <HI>French</HI> King from one End of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> to the Other, should not now be able to Beat a Creature of His accompany'd by a few starvling Pugatives, and cowardly Mer∣cenaries. Nevertheless, tho' we do not fear him; tho' we have no Reason to be afraid of him and all his Abbetors, yet we may by too much Security, so expose our selves, as to have just Grounds for Fear hereafter. If we are too negligens of our own Defence, or have too much Linety for his Friends, we spare them at our own Cost, and are the Instruments of our own Peril. I would not be mistaken, That I think we ought to end the Dispute, as the <HI>Tories</HI> would end theirs on the like Occasion.
