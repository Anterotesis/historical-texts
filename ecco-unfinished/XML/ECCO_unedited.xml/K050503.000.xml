<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Should hardly have given the Reader the Trouble of a Preface, were it not to pay my Acknow∣ledgment to the kind Performers, who, notwithstanding the Hazard of being discountenanc'd, are yet so good-natur'd once more to venture in this Dangerous Road, purely with the friendly Desire of assisting my Interest.</P>
<P>We all join'd in this Belief, That I was below the Notice of the Criticks, and therefore hop'd I might escape their Cen∣sure. I own, Poetry is a thing I little un∣derstand; yet should I meet a better Fate than possibly I may deserve, I shall grate∣fully acknowledge my self oblig'd to the
<PB REF="4"/>
generous Town for their Indulgence, but never arrogate to my self any Merit thereon.</P>
<P>This Attempt being begun soon after the Run of the Celebrated <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera</HI> (to mention which gives me some Confu∣sion, while I am speaking of my own weak Endeavours) the Reader may perhaps find some few Tunes since made use of in other Entertainments of this Kind. I must de∣clare the Songs thereto were made before I ever saw any such Performances—and had Leisure permitted me, I had alter'd 'em —Such as it is, I throw it on the Mercy of its Auditors.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>CIBBER</HI> jun.</BYLINE>
<L>OUR <HI>humble</HI> Bard (well he deserves that Name,</L>
<L>Who from the <HI>Muse</HI> no borrow'd <HI>Aid</HI> can claim;)</L>
<L>Seeing your <HI>modern</HI> Opera's spring so thick,</L>
<L>Thought <HI>Sing-song easie</HI> as a <HI>Juggler</HI>'s <HI>Trick</HI>.</L>
<L>Building on <HI>This,</HI> and conscious of no Skill,</L>
<L>He gives You <HI>his</HI> Assay, of pure good Will.</L>
<L>Since he pleads <HI>guilty, wink</HI> at <HI>one</HI> Offence:</L>
<L><HI>Mercy</HI> has oft reclaim'd to <HI>sober Sense</HI>.</L>
<L>He likes the Trade <HI>so ill,</HI> as a <HI>Beginner,</HI></L>
<L>He swears, he ne'er shall grow a <HI>harden'd</HI> Sinner:</L>
<L>Unless—Heav'n help him! — <HI>Wit</HI> should turn his Brain;</L>
<L>Then—look for <HI>Hurlothrumbo's</HI> once again;</L>
<L>Then look—to see him <HI>ride the Moon,</HI>—and <HI>dance,</HI>—</L>
<L>And <HI>fiddle</HI> to his <HI>own Extravagance</HI>.</L>
<L>Tho',—should <HI>That</HI> happen, he might plead some <HI>Merit;</HI></L>
<L>What <HI>once</HI> was <HI>Madness, now</HI> is <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>.</L>
<L>But, <HI>yet,</HI> poor Soul! he claims not <HI>that proud</HI> Bays,</L>
<L>You'll <HI>understand</HI> him,—tho' you should not <HI>praise</HI>.</L>
<L>For <HI>Those</HI> whose <HI>doubtful</HI> Fate it is to be</L>
<L>The <HI>Organs</HI> of his <HI>chaunted</HI> Poetry,</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Him</HI> you censure, think, They <HI>barely</HI> do</L>
<L>Nor <HI>more,</HI> nor <HI>less,</HI> than what <HI>He prompts</HI> 'em to.</L>
<L>Then, 'faith, be kind;—you've had your Treat of <HI>Wit;</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>He</HI> would <HI>needs</HI> throw in his <HI>gratis Bit</HI>.</L>
<L>Like a <HI>frank Host,</HI> that, when the Reck'ning's o'er,</L>
<L>Brings up his Flask, adds <HI>Nothing</HI> to your <HI>Score</HI>.</L>
