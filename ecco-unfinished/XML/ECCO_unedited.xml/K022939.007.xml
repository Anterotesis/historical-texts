<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Publisher of the Surreptitious Edition, 1735.</HEAD>
<P>WE presume we want no apology to the reader for this publication, but some may be thought needful to Mr. Pope: however he cannot think our offence so great as theirs, who first separately published what we have here but collected in a better form and order. As for the letters we have procured to be added, they serve but to complete, explain, and sometimes set in a true light, those others, which it was not in the writer's, or our power to recall.</P>
<P>This collection hath been owing to several cabi∣nets: some drawn from thence by accidents, and others (even of those to ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of that sex we are beholden for the whole correspondence with H. C. esq. which let∣ters being lent her by that gentleman, she took the liberty to print; as appears by the following,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
which we shall give at length, both as it is some∣thing curious, and as it may serve for an apo∣logy for ourselves.</P>

<P>AFTER so long a silence as the many and great oppressions I have sighed un∣der have occasioned, one is at a loss how to begin a letter to so kind a friend as yourself. But as it was always my resolution, if I must sink, to do it as decently (that is, as silently) as I could; so when I found myself plunged into unforeseen, and unavoidable ruin, I retreated from the world, and in a manner buried my∣self in a dismal place, where I knew none, and none knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I have protracted a lingring death (for life it cannot be called) ever since you saw me, se∣questered from company, deprived of my books, and nothing left to converse with, but the letters of my dead or absent friends; among which latter I always placed yours, and Mr. Pope's in the first rank. I lent some of them indeed to an ingenious person, who was so de∣lighted with the specimen, that he importuned me for a sight of the rest, which having ob∣tained,
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
he conveyed them to the press, I must not say altogether with my consent, nor wholly without it. I thought them too good to be lost in oblivion, and had no cause to apprehend the disobliging of any. The public, viz. all persons of taste and judgment, would be pleased with so agreeable an amusement; Mr. Cromwell could not be angry, since it was but justice to his merit, to publish the solemn and private professions of love, gratitude, and veneration, made him by so celebrated an author; and sin∣cerely Mr. Pope ought not to resent the publi∣cation, since the early pregnancy of his genius was no dishonour to his character. And yet had either of you been asked, common mo∣desty would have obliged you to refuse, what you would not be displeased with, if done without your knowledge. And besides, to end all dispute, you had been pleased to make me a free gift of them, to do what I pleased with them; and every one knows, that the person to whom a letter is addressed, has the same right to dispose of it, as he has of goods pur∣chased with his money. I doubt not but your generosity and honour will do me the right, of owning by a line that I came honestly by them. I flatter myself, in a few months I shall again be visible to the world; and whenever thro' good providence that turn shall happen,
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
I shall joyfully acquaint you with it, there be∣ing none more truly your obliged servant, than, Sir,</P>

<P>WHEN these letters were first printed, I wondered how Curll could come by them, and could not but laugh at the pompous title; since whatever you wrote to me was hu∣mour, and familiar raillery. As soon as I came from Epsom, I heard you had been to see me, and I writ you a short letter from Will's, that I longed to see you. Mr. D—s, about that time charged me with giving them to a mi∣stress, which I positively denied: not in the least, at that time, thinking of it; but some time after, finding in the News papers Letters
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
from Lady Packington, Lady Chudleigh, and Mr. Norris to the same Sappho or E. T. I be∣gan to fear that I was guilty. I have never seen these Letters of Curll's, nor would go to his shop about them; I have not seen this Sappho alias E. T. these seven years.—Her writing, <HI>That I gave her 'em, to do what I would with 'em,</HI> is straining the point too far. I thought not of it, nor do I think she did then; but se∣vere necessity which catches hold of a twig, has produced all this; which has lain hid, and forgot, by me so many years. Curll sent me a letter last week, desiring a positive answer about this matter, but finding I would give him none, he went to E. T. and writ a postscript in her long romantick letter, to direct my an∣swer to his house; but they not expecting an answer, sent a young man to me, whose name, it seems, is Pattison. I told him I should not write any thing, but I believed it might be so as she writ in her letter. I am extremely con∣cerned that my former indiscretion in putting them into the hands of this <HI>Pretieuse,</HI> should have given you so much disturbance; for the last thing I should do would be to disoblige you, for whom I have ever preserved the greatest esteem, and shall ever be, Sir,</P>

<P>THO' I writ my long narrative from Ep∣som 'till I was tired, yet was I not sa∣tisfied; lest any doubt should rest upon your mind. I could not make protestations of my innocence of a grievous crime; but I was im∣patient till I came to town, that I might send you those Letters, as a clear evidence that I was a perfect stranger to all their proceeding. Should I have protested against it, after the printing, it might have been taken for an at∣tempt to decry his purchase; and as the little exception you have taken has served him to play his game upon us for these two years, a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more.—The great value she expresses for all you write, and her passion for having them, I believe, was what prevailed upon me to let her keep them. By the inter∣val of twelve years at least, from her possession to the time of printing them, 'tis manifest, that I had not the least ground to apprehend such a design: but as people in great straits, bring forth their hoards of old gold and most valued
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
jewels; so Sappho had recourse to her hid trea∣sure of Letters, and played off not only your's to me, but all those to herself (as the lady's last stake) into the press.—As for me, I hope, when you shall cooly consider the many thou∣sand instances of our being deluded by the fe∣males, since that great Original of Adam by Eve, you will have a more favourable thought of the undesigning error of</P>

<P>Now should our apology for this publica∣tion be as ill received, as the lady's seems to have been by the gentlemen concerned; we shall at least have <HI>Her Comfort,</HI> of being thanked by the rest of the world. Nor has Mr. P. himself any great cause to think it much offence to his modesty, or reflection on his judgment; when we take care to inform the public, that there are few Letters of his in this collection, which were not writ∣ten under twenty years of age: on the other hand, we doubt not the reader will be much
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
more surprized to find, at that early period, so much variety of style, affecting sentiment, and justness of criticism, in pieces which must have been writ in haste, very few perhaps ever reviewed, and none intended for the eye of the public.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Prefixed to the First Genuine Edition in quarto, 1737.</HEAD>
<P>IF what is here offered the reader, should happen in any degree to please him, the thanks are not due to the author, but partly to his friends, and partly to his enemies: it was wholly owing to the affection of the for∣mer, that so many Letters, of which he never kept copies, were preserved; and to the ma∣lice of the latter, that they were produced in this manner.</P>
<P>He had been very disagreeably used, in the publication of some Letters written in his youth, which fell into the hands of a woman who printed them, without his, or his corres∣pondent's consent, in 1727. This treatment, and the apprehension of more of the same kind, put him upon recalling as many as he could from those who he imagined had kept any. He was sorry to find the number so great, but immediately lessened it by burning three parts in four of them: the rest he
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
spared, not in any preference of their style or writing, but merely as they preserved the me∣mory of some friendships which will ever be dear to him, or set in a true light some mat∣ters of fact, from which the scriblers of the times had taken occasion to asperse either his friends or himself. He therefore lay'd by the Originals, together with those of his corres∣pondents, and caused a copy to be taken to de∣posite in the library of a noble friend; that in case either of the revival of slanders, or the publication of surreptitious Letters, during his life or after, a proper use might be made of them.</P>
<P>The next year, the posthumous works of Mr. Wycherley were printed, in a way disrepu∣table enough to his memory. It was thought a justice due to him, to shew the world his bet∣ter judgment; and that it was his last resolu∣tion to have suppressed those poems. As some of the Letters which had passed between him and our author cleared that point, they were published in 1729, with a few marginal notes added by a friend.</P>
<P>If in these Letters, and in those which were printed without his consent, there appear too much of a juvenile ambition of wit, or affe∣ctation of gaiety, he may reasonably hope it will be considered to <HI>whom,</HI> and at <HI>what age,</HI>
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
he was guilty of it, as well as how soon it was over. The rest, every judge of writing will see, were by no means efforts of the genius, but emanations of the heart: and this alone may induce any candid reader to believe their publication an act of necessity, rather than of vanity.</P>
<P>It is notorious, how many volumes have been published under the title of his correspon∣dence, with promises still of more, and open and repeated offers of encouragement to all per∣sons who should send any letters of his for the press. It is as notorious what methods were taken to procure them, even from the pub∣lisher's own accounts in his prefaces, viz. by transacting with people in necessities,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to vol. i. of a Book called Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence.</NOTE> or of abandoned<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Postscript to the Preface to vol. iv.</NOTE> characters, or such as dealt without names in the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Narrative and Anecdotes before vol. ii.</NOTE> dark. Upon a quarrel with one of these last, he betrayed himself so far, as to appeal to the public in Narratives and Advertisements: like that Irish highway-man a few years before, who preferr'd a bill against his companion, for not sharing equally in the money, rings and watches, they had traded for in partnership upon Hounslow-heath.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
Several have been printed in his name which he never writ, and addressed to persons to whom they never were written <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In Vol. iii. Letters from Mr. Pope to Mrs. Blount, &amp;c.</NOTE>; counterfeited as from bishop Atterbury to him, which neither that bishop nor he ever saw <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. of the same, 8°. pag. 20. and at the end of the Edition of his Letters in 12°, by the booksellers of London and Westminster; and of the last Edition in 12°, printed for T. Cooper, 1725.</NOTE>; and advertized even after that period when it was made felony to correspond with him.</P>
<P>I know not how it has been this author's fate, whom both his situation and his temper have all his life excluded from rivalling any man, in any pretension, (except that of pleasing by poetry) to have been as much aspersed and writ∣ten at, as any First Minister of his time: pam∣phlets and news-papers have been full of him, nor was it <HI>there only</HI> that a private man, who never troubled either the world or common conversation with his opinions of Religion or Government, has been represented as a danger∣ous member of Society, a bigotted Papist, and an enemy to the Establishment. The unwar∣rantable publication of his Letters hath at least done him this service, to shew he has constant∣ly enjoyed the friendship of worthy men; and that if a catalogue were to be taken of his
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>
friends and his enemies, he needs not to blush at either. Many of them having been written on the most trying occurrences, and all in the openness of friendship, are a proof what were his real sentiments, as they flowed warm from the heart, and fresh from the occasion; with∣out the least thought that ever the world should be witness to them. Had he sate down with a design to draw his own picture, he could not have done it so truly; for whoever sits for it (whether to himself or another) will inevitably find the features more composed, than his ap∣pear in these letters. But if an author's hand, like a painter's, be more distinguishable in a slight sketch than in a finished picture, this very carelessness will make them the better known from such counterfeits, as have been, and may be imputed to him, either through a mercenary or a malicious design.</P>
<P>We hope it is needless to say, he is not ac∣countable for several passages in the surreptiti∣ous editions of those Letters, which are such as no man of common sense would have pub∣lished himself. The errors of the press were almost innumerable, and could not but be ex∣tremely multiplied in so many repeated edi∣tions, by the avarice and negligence of pira∣tical printers, to not one of whom he ever
<PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>
gave the least Title, or any other encourage∣ment than that of not prosecuting them.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Chasms</HI> in the correspondence, we had not the means to supply them, the Author having destroyed too many Letters to preserve any Series. Nor would he go about to amend them, except by the omission of some passages, improper, or at least impertinent, to be di∣vulged to the publick: or of such entire Let∣ters, as were either not his, or not approved of by him.</P>
<P>He has been very sparing of those of his Friends, and thought it a respect shown to their memory, to suppress in particular such as were most in his favour. As it is not to <HI>Vanity</HI> but to <HI>Friendship</HI> that he intends this Monu∣ment, he would save his enemies the mortifi∣cation of showing any further how well their Betters have thought of him: and at the same time secure from their censure his living Friends, who (he promises them) shall never be put to the blush, this way at least, for their partiality to him.</P>
<P>But however this Collection may be received, we cannot but lament the <HI>Cause,</HI> and the <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI> of such a publication, and heartily wish no honest man may be reduced to the same. To state the case fairly in the present situation. A Bookseller advertizes his intention to publish
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>
your Letters: he openly promises encourage∣ment, or even pecuniary rewards, to those who will help him to any; and ingages to insert whatever they shall send. Any scandal is sure of a reception, and any enemy who sends it screened from a discovery. Any domestic or servant, who can snatch a letter from your pocket or cabinet, is encouraged to that vile practice. If the quantity falls short of a vo∣lume, any thing else shall be joined with it (more especially scandal) which the collector can think for his interest, all recommended un∣der your Name: you have not only Theft to fear, but Forgery. Any Bookseller, tho' con∣scious in what manner they were obtained, not caring what may be the consequence to your Fame or Quiet, will sell and disperse them in town and country. The better your Reputa∣tion is, the more your Name will cause them to be demanded, and consequently the more you will be injured. The injury is of such a nature, as the Law (which does not punish for <HI>Inten∣tions)</HI> cannot prevent; and when done, may punish, but not redress. You are therefore re∣duced, either to enter into a personal treaty with such a man (which tho' the readiest, is the meanest of all methods) or to take such other measures to suppress them, as are con∣trary to your Inclination, or to publish them,
<PB N="xix" REF="20"/>
as are contrary to your Modesty. Otherwise your Fame and your Property suffer alike; you are at once exposed and plundered. As an <HI>Author,</HI> you are deprived of that Power, which above all others constitutes a good one, the power of rejecting, and the right of judging for your self, what pieces it may be most use∣ful, entertaining, or reputable to publish, at the time and in the manner you think best. As a <HI>Man,</HI> you are deprived of the right even over your own Sentiments, of the privi∣lege of every human creature to divulge or conceal them; of the advantage of your Second thoughts; and of all the benefit of your Pru∣dence, your Candour, or your Modesty. As a <HI>Member of Society,</HI> you are yet more injured; your private conduct, your domestic concerns, your family secrets, your passions, your tender∣nesses, your weaknesses, are exposed to the Misconstruction or Resentment of some, to the Censure or Impertinence of the whole world. The printing private letters in such a manner, is the worst sort of <HI>betraying Conversation,</HI> as it has evidently the most extensive, and the most lasting, ill consequences. It is the highest offence against <HI>Society,</HI> as it renders the most dear and intimate intercourse of friend with friend, and the most necessary commerce of man with man, unsafe, and to be dreaded. To
<PB N="xx" REF="21"/>
open Letters is esteemed the greatest breach of honour; even to look into them already opened or accidentally dropt, is held an un∣generous, if not an immoral Act. What then can be thought of the procuring them merely by Fraud, and the printing them merely for Lucre? We cannot but conclude every honest man will wish, that, if the Laws have as yet provided no adequate remedy, one at least may be found, to prevent so great and growing an evil.</P>

<P>IT was certainly a great satisfaction to me to see and converse with a Man, whom in his writings I had so long known with plea∣sure; but it was a high addition to it, to hear
<PB N="4" REF="36"/>
you, at our very first meeting, doing justice to your dead friend Mr. Dryden. I was not so happy as to know him: <HI>Virgilium tantum vi∣di</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">When a very young Boy, he prevailed with a friend to carry him to a Cof∣fee-house which Dryden fre∣quented; where he had the satisfaction he speaks of.</NOTE>. Had I been born early enough, I must have known and lov'd him: For I have been assured, not only by yourself, but by Mr. Con∣greve and Sir William Trumbul, that his per∣sonal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwithstanding the many libellous misrepre∣sentations of them, against which the former of these Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">He since did so, in his dedication to the Duke of Newcastle, prefix'd to the duodecimo Edition of Dry∣den's Plays, 1717. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. I suppose those injuries were begun by the violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continued by envy at his suc∣cess and fame <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The fact seems to have been just the reverse. One of the first Satires against him was the Duke of Buck∣ingham's <HI>Rehearsal;</HI> and one of the last, Montague's paro∣dy of his <HI>Hind and Panther.</HI></NOTE>: And those Scriblers who at∣tacked him in his latter times, were only like gnats in a summer's evening, which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glo∣rious season; for his fire, like the sun's, shined clearest towards its setting.</P>
<P>You must not therefore imagine, that when you told me my own performances were
<PB N="5" REF="37"/>
above those Critics, I was so vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be so humble as to think myself quite below their notice. For critics, as they are birds of prey, have ever a natural in∣clination to carrion: and tho' such poor writers as I are but beggars, no beggar is so poor but he can keep a cur, and no author is so beggarly but he can keep a critic. I am far from think∣ing the attacks of such people either any ho∣nour or dishonour even to me, much less to Mr. Dryden. I agree with you, that whatever lesser Wits have risen since his death, are but like stars appearing when the sun is set, that twin∣kle only in his absence, and with the rays they have borrowed from him. Our wit (as you call it) is but reflection or imitation, therefore scarce to be called ours. True Wit, I believe, may be defined a justness of thought, and a facility of expression; or (in the midwives phrase) a perfect conception, with an easy delivery <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">This is no definition of wit at all, but of good writ∣ing in general.</NOTE>. However, this is far from a complete definition; pray help me to a better <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mr. Locke had given a better. But his Essay was a work our young Poet did not then relish.

<P>I Have been so busy of late in correcting and transcribing some of my madrigals for a great man or two who desired to see them, that I have (with your pardon) omitted to return you an answer to your most ingenious letter: so scriblers to the public, like bankers to the pub∣lic, are profuse in their voluntary loans to it, whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more just debts, to their best and nearest friends. However, I hope, you who have as much good-nature as good sense (since they generally are companions <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Good-nature and good sense generally are compa∣nions, yet wit and humanity seldom accompany each other.</HI> But they might keep com∣pany or not, just as they pleased, for the Author was gone in search of Witticisms.</NOTE>) will have pa∣tience with a debtor who has an inclination to pay you his obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time should consider, when you have obliged me beyond my present power of returning the favour, that a debtor may be an honest man, if he but intends to be just when he is able, tho' late. But I should be less just to you, the more I thought I could make a return to so much profuseness of Wit and Humanity together; which tho' they sel∣dom accompany each other in other men <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Good-nature and good sense generally are compa∣nions, yet wit and humanity seldom accompany each other.</HI> But they might keep com∣pany or not, just as they pleased, for the Author was gone in search of Witticisms.</NOTE>, are
<PB N="7" REF="39"/>
in you so equally met, I know not in which you most abound. But so much for my opinion of you, which is, that your Wit and Ingenuity is equalled by nothing but your Judgment or Modesty, which (tho' it be to please myself) I must no more offend, than I can do either right.</P>
<P>Therefore I will say no more now of them, than that your good wit never forfeited your good judgment, but in your partiality to me and mine; so that if it were possible for a hardened scribler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited than what I scrible myself: yet, I must confess, I ought to be more humbled by your praise than exalted, which commends my little sense with so much more of yours, that I am disparaged and disheartened by your commendations; who give me an example of your wit in the first part of your letter, and a definition of it in the last; to make writing well (that is, like you) more difficult to me than ever it was before. Thus the more great and just your example and defi∣nition of wit are, the less I am capable to follow them. Then the best way of shewing my judg∣ment, after having seen how you write, is to
<PB N="8" REF="40"/>
leave off writing; and the best way to shew my friendship to you, is to put an end to your trou∣ble, and to conclude</P>

<P>WHEN I write to you, I foresee a long letter, and ought to beg your patience before-hand; for if it proves the longest, it will be of course the worst I have troubled you with. Yet to express my gratitude at large for your obliging letter, is not more my duty than my interest; as some people will abundantly thank you for one piece of kindness, to put you in mind of bestowing another. The more fa∣vourable you are to me, the more distinctly I see my faults: Spots and blemishes, you know, are never so plainly discovered as in the bright∣est sunshine. Thus I am mortified by those commendations which were designed to encou∣rage me: for praise to a young wit, is like rain to a tender flower; if it be moderately bestow∣ed, it chears and revives; but if too lavishly, overcharges and depresses him. Most men in years, as they are generally discouragers of youth, are like old trees, that, being past bear∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="41"/>
themselves, will suffer no young plants to flourish beneath them: but, as if it were not enough to have out-done all your coevals in wit, you will excel them in good-nature too. As for<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His Pastorals, written at sixteen years of age. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> my green essays, if you find any plea∣sure in them, it must be such as a man natu∣rally takes in observing the first shoots and bud∣dings of a tree which he has raised himself: and 'tis impossible they should be esteemed any otherwise, than as we value fruits for being early, which nevertheless are the most insipid, and the worst of the year. In a word, I must blame you for treating me with so much com∣pliment, which is at best but the smoke of friendship. I neither write, nor converse with you, to gain your praise, but your Affection. Be so much my friend as to appear my enemy, and tell me my faults, if not as a young Man, at least as an unexperienced Writer.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the twenty-fifth of March I have received, which was more wel∣come
<PB N="10" REF="42"/>
to me than any thing could be out of the country, tho' it were one's rent due that day; and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with want of sincerity, or justice, for giving you your due; who should not let your modesty be so unjust to your merit, as to reject what is due to it, and call that compli∣ment, which is so short of your desert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if com∣pliment be the smoke only of friendship (as you say) however, you must allow there is no smoke but there is some fire; and as the sacrifice of incense offered to the Gods would not have been half so sweet to others, if it had not been for its smoke; so friendship, like love, cannot be without some incense, to perfume the name it would praise and immortalize. But since you say you do not write to me to gain my praise, but my affection, pray how is it possible to have the one without the other? we must admire before we love. You affirm, you would have me so much your friend as to appear your ene∣my, and find out your faults rather than your perfections; but (my friend) that would be so hard to do, that I, who love no difficulties, can't be persuaded to it. Besides, the vanity of a scribler is such, that he will never part with his own judgment to gratify another's; especially when he must take pains to do it: and tho' I
<PB N="11" REF="43"/>
am proud to be of your opinion, when you talk of any thing or man but yourself, I can∣not suffer you to murder your fame with your own hand, without opposing you; especially when you say your last letter is the worst (since the longest) you have favoured me with; which I therefore think the best, as the longest life (if a good one) is the best; as it yields the more variety, and is the more exemplary; as a chear∣ful summer's day, tho' longer than a dull one in the winter, is less tedious and more entertaining. Therefore let but your friendship be like your letter, as lasting as it is agreeable, and it can never be tedious, but more acceptable and ob∣liging to</P>

<P>I Have received yours of the fifth, wherein your modesty refuses the just praises I give you, by which you lay claim to more, as a bishop gains his bishopric by saying he will not episcopate; but I must confess, whilst I displease you by commending you, I please myself: just as incense is sweeter to the offerer
<PB N="12" REF="44"/>
than the deity to whom 'tis offered, by his being so much above it: For indeed every man partakes of the praise he gives, when it is so justly given.</P>
<P>As to my enquiry after your intrigues with the Muses, you may allow me to make it, since no old man can give so young, so great, and able a favourite of theirs, jealousy. I am, in my enquiry, like old Sir Bernard Gascoign, who used to say, that when he was grown too old to have his visits admitted alone by the la∣dies, he always took along with him a young man to ensure his welcome to them; for had he come alone he had been rejected, only be∣cause his visits were not scandalous to them. So I am (like an old rook, who is ruined by gaming) forced to live on the good fortune of the pushing young men, whose fancies are so vigorous that they ensure their success in their adventures with the Muses, by their strength of imagination.</P>
<P>Your papers are safe in my custody (you may be sure) from any one's theft but my own; for 'tis as dangerous to trust a scribler with your wit, as a gamester with the custody of your money.—If you happen to come to town, you will make it more difficult for me to leave it, who am</P>

<P>I Cannot contend with you: You must give me leave at once to wave all your compli∣ments, and to collect only this in general from them, that your design is to encourage me. But I separate from all the rest that paragraph or two, in which you make me so warm an offer of your Friendship. Were I possessed of that, it would put an end to all those speeches with which you now make me blush; and change them to wholsome advices, and free sentiments, which might make me wiser and happier. I know 'tis the general opinion, that friendship is best contracted betwixt persons of equal age; but I have so much interest to be of another mind, that you must pardon me if I can∣not forbear telling you a few notions of mine, in opposition to that opinion.</P>
<P>In the first place 'tis observable, that the love we bear to our friends, is generally caused by our finding the same dispositions in them, which we feel in ourselves. This is but self-love at the bottom: whereas the affection betwixt peo∣ple of different ages cannot well be so, the in∣clinations of such being commonly various. The friendship of two young men is often oc∣casioned
<PB N="14" REF="46"/>
by love of pleasure or voluptuousness, each being desirous for his own sake of one to assist or encourage him in the courses he pur∣sues; as that of two old men is frequently on the score of some profit, lucre, or design upon others. Now, as a young man who is less ac∣quainted with the ways of the world, has in all probability less of interest; and an old man, who may be weary of himself, has, or should have less of self-love; so the friendship between them is the more likely to be true, and un∣mixed with too much self-regard. One may add to this, that such a friendship is of greater use and advantage to both; for the old man will grow gay and agreeable to please the young one; and the young man more discreet and prudent by the help of the old one: so it may prove a cure of those epidemical diseases of age and youth, sourness and madness. I hope you will not need many arguments to convince you of the possibility of this; one alone abundantly sa∣tisfies me, and convinces to the heart; which is, that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wycherley was at this time about seventy years old, Mr. Pope under seventeen. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> young as I am, and old as you are, I am your entirely affectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 23, 1705.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Should believe myself happy in your good opinion, but that you treat me so much in a style of compliment. It hath been observed of women, that they are more subject in their youth to be touched with vanity, than men, on account of their being generally treated this way; but the weakest women are not more weak than that class of men, who are thought to pique themselves upon their Wit. The world is never wanting, when a coxcomb is accomplishing himself, to help to give him the finishing stroke.</P>
<P>Every man is apt to think his neighbour over∣stock'd with vanity, yet, I cannot but fancy there are certain times, when most people are in a disposition of being informed; and 'tis incredi∣ble what a vast good a little truth might do, spoken in such seasons. A small alms will do a great kindness, to people in extreme necessity.</P>
<P>I could name an acquaintance of yours, who would at this time think himself more obliged to you for the information of his faults, than the confirmation of his follies. If you would make those the subject of a letter, it might be as long as I could wish your letters always were.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="48"/>
I do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty (as you are pleased to say) in writing to me, since you have always chosen the task of commending me: take but the other way, and, I dare engage, you will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my verses, which you praise so much, I may truly say they have never been the cause of any vanity in me, except what they gave me when they first occasioned my acquaintance with you. But I have several times since been in danger of this vice; as often, I mean, as I re∣ceived any letters from you. 'Tis certain, the greatest magnifying glasses in the world are a man's own eyes when they look upon his own person; yet even in those, I cannot fancy my∣self so extremely like Alexander the great, as you would persuade me. If I must be like him, 'tis you will make me so, by compliment∣ing me into a better opinion of myself than I deserve: They made him think he was the son of Jupiter, and you assure me I am a man of parts. But is this all you can say to my ho∣nour? you said ten times as much before, when you call'd me your friend. After having made me believe I possess'd a share in your affection, to treat me with compliments and sweet sayings, is like the proceeding with poor Sancho Panca: they persuaded him that he enjoy'd a great do∣minion,
<PB N="17" REF="49"/>

For as when mad∣men are found incurable, wise men give them their way, and please them as well as they can; so when those incorrigible things, Poets, are once irrecoverably be-mus'd, the best way both to quiet them, and secure yourself from the effects of their frenzy, is to feed their vanity; which indeed, for the most part, is all that is fed in a poet.</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be heartily glad that all you say were as true, applied to me, as it would be to yourself, for several weighty reasons; but for none so much as that I might be to you what you deserve; whereas I can now be no more than is consistent with the small tho' utmost capacity of &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Have now changed the scene from the town to the country; from Will's coffee-house to Windsor-forest. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the common town-wits, and the downright country fools; that the first are
<PB N="18" REF="50"/>
pertly in the wrong, with a little more flourish and gayety; and the last neither in the right nor the wrong, but confirmed in a stupid set∣tled medium betwixt both. However, me∣thinks, these are most in the right, who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle reign of dulness, which the Wits must do at last, tho' after a great deal of noise, and resist∣ance. Ours are a sort of modest inoffensive people, who neither have sense, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial sort of dulness: They are commonly known in the world by the name of honest, civil gentlemen: They live, much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting life, pursuing with earnestness and hazard some∣thing not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but prefer solitude to the company of all these; for tho' a man's self may possibly be the worst fellow to con∣verse with in the world, yet one would think the company of a person whom we have the greatest regard to and affection for, could not be very unpleasant. As a man in love with a mistress, desires no conversation but hers, so a man in love with himself (as most men are) may be best pleased with his own. Besides, if the truest and most useful knowledge be the knowledge of ourselves, solitude, conducing most to make us look into ourselves, should be
<PB N="19" REF="51"/>
the most instructive state of life. We see no∣thing more commonly, than men, who for the sake of the circumstantial part and mere out∣side of life, have been half their days rambling out of their nature, and ought to be sent into solitude to study themselves over again. Peo∣ple are usually spoiled, instead of being taught, at their coming into the world; whereas by be∣ing more conversant with Obscurity, without any pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a man be a coxcomb, Solitude is his best School; and if he be a fool, it is his best Sanctuary.</P>
<P>These are good reasons for my own stay here, but I wish I could give you any for your com∣ing hither, except that I earnestly invite you. And yet I can't help saying I have suffered a great deal of discontent that you do not come, tho' I so little merit that you should.</P>
<P>I must complain of the shortness of your last. Those who have most wit, like those who have most money, are generally most spa∣ring of either.</P>

<P>YOurs of the 26th of October I have re∣ceived, as I have always done yours, with no little satisfaction, and am proud to discover by it, that you find fault with the shortness of mine, which I think the best excuse for it: And tho' they (as you say) who have most wit or money are most sparing of either; there are some who appear poor to be thought rich, and are poor, which is my case. I cannot but re∣joice, that you have undergone so much discon∣tent for want of my company; but if you have a mind to punish me for my fault (which I could not help) defer your coming to town, and you will do it effectually. But I know your charity always exceeds your revenge, so that I will not despair of seeing you, and, in return to your inviting me to your forest, in∣vite you to my forest, the town; where the beasts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long ears or horns, pursue one another either out of love or hatred. You may have the pleasure to see one pack of blood-hounds pursue another herd of brutes, to bring each other to their fall, which is their whole sport: Or if you affect a
<PB N="21" REF="53"/>
less bloody chace, you may see a pack of spa∣niels, called Lovers, in a hot pursuit of a two-legged vixen, who only flies the whole loud pack to be singled out by one dog, who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest, as they are making a noise to the loss of their game. In fine, this is the time for all sorts of sport in the town, when those of the country cease; therefore leave your forest of beasts for ours of brutes, called men, who now in full cry (pack'd by the court or country) run down in the house of commons a deserted horned beast of the Court, to the satisfaction of their spectators: Besides, (more for your diversion) you may see not only the two great play-houses of the nation, those of the lords and commons, in dispute with one another; but the two other play-houses in high contest, because the mem∣bers of one house are remov'd up to t'other, as it is often done by the court for reasons of state. Insomuch that the lower houses, I mean the play-houses, are going to act tragedies on one another without doors, and the Sovereign is put to it (as it often happens in the other two houses) to silence one or both, to keep peace between them. Now I have told you all the news of the town.</P>

<P>I Have receiv'd your kind Letter, with my paper<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The same which was printed in the Year 1717, in a Miscellany of Bern. Lintot's, and in the Post∣humous Works of Mr. Wy∣cherly. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> to Mr. Dryden corrected. I own you have made more of it by making it less, as the Dutch are said to burn half the spices they bring home, to inhance the price of the re∣mainder, so to be greater gainers by their loss, (which is indeed my case now.) You have prun'd my fading lawrels of some super∣fluous, sapless, and dead branches, to make the remainder live the longer; thus, like your master Apollo, you are at once a poet and a physician.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the town, your good nature was the first cause of my confident request; but excuse me, I must (I see) say no more upon this subject, since I find you a little too nice to be dealt free∣ly with; tho' you have given me some encou∣ragement to hope, our friendship might be without shyness, or criminal modesty; for a
<PB N="23" REF="55"/>
friend, like a mistress, tho' he is not to be mer∣cenary, to be true, yet ought not to refuse a friend's kindness because it is small or trivial: I have told you (I think) what a Spanish lady said to her poor poetical gallant, that a Queen if she had to do with a groom, would expect a mark of his kindness from him, though it were but his curry-comb. But you and I will dispute this matter when I am so happy as to see you here; and perhaps 'tis the only dispute in which I might hope to have the bet∣ter of you.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, to make you another excuse for my boldness in inviting you to town, I design'd to leave with you some more of my papers, (since these return so much better out of your hands than they went from mine) for I intend∣ed (as I told you formerly) to spend a month, or six weeks this summer, near you in the coun∣try. You may be assured there is nothing I desire so much, as an improvement of your friendship.</P>

<P>BY one of yours of the last month, you de∣sire me to select, if possible, some things from the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Printed in folio, in the year 1704. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> first volume of your Miscellanies, which may be alter'd so as to appear again. I doubted your meaning in this; whether it was to pick out the best of those verses (as those on the Idleness of business, on Ignorance, on La∣ziness, &amp;c.) to make the method and numbers exact, and avoid repetitions? For tho' (upon reading 'em on this occasion) I believe, they might receive such an alteration with advan∣tage; yet they would not be changed so much, but any one would know 'em for the same at first sight. Or if you mean to improve the worst pieces? which are such, as, to render them very good, would require great addi∣tion, and almost the entire new writing of them. Or, lastly, if you mean the middle sort, as the Songs and Love-verses? For these will need only to be shortened, to omit repetition; the words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know your mind in this, for I am utterly at a loss.
<PB N="25" REF="57"/>
Yet I have try'd what I could do to some of the songs, and the poems on Laziness and Ig∣norance, but can't (even in my own partial judgment) think my alterations much to the purpose. So that I must needs desire you would apply your care wholly at present to those which are yet unpublished, of which there are more than enough to make a considerable volume, of full as good ones, nay, I believe, of better than any in Vol. I. which I could wish you would defer, at least 'till you have finish'd these that are yet unprinted.</P>
<P>I send you a sample of some few of these; namely, the verses to Mr. Waller in his old age; your new ones on the Duke of Marlbo∣rough, and two others. I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them: some I have contracted, as we do sun-beams, to im∣prove their energy and force: some I have ta∣ken quite away, as we take branches from a tree, to add to the fruit; others I have entirely new express'd, and turned more into poetry. Donne (like one of his successors) had infinite∣ly more wit than he wanted versification: for the great dealers of wit, like those in trade, take least pains to set off their goods; while the haberdashers of small wit, spare for no de∣corations or ornaments. You have commis∣sion'd me to paint your shop, and I have done
<PB N="26" REF="58"/>
my best to brush you up like your neighbours <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Several of Mr. Pope's lines, very easy to be di∣stinguished, may be found in the Posthumous Editions of Wycherley's Poems: parti∣cularly in those <HI>on Solitude, on the Public,</HI> and <HI>on the Mixed life.</HI></NOTE>. But I can no more pretend to the merit of the production, than a midwife to the virtues and good qualities of the child she helps into the light.</P>
<P>The few things I have entirely added, you will excuse; you may take them lawfully for your own, because they are no more than sparks lighted up by your fire: and you may omit them at last, if you think them but squibs in your triumphs.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd yours of the 9<SUP>th</SUP> yesterday, which has (like the rest of your letters) at once pleas'd and instructed me; so that, I assure you, you can no more write too much to your absent friends, than speak too much to the present. This is a truth that all men own who have either seen your writings, or heard your dis∣course;

enough to make others show their judg∣ment, in ceasing to write or talk, especially to you, or in your company. However, I speak or write to you, not to please you, but myself; since I provoke your answers; which whilst they humble me, give me vanity; tho' I am lessen'd by you even when you commend me: since you commend my little sense with so much more of yours, that you put me out of countenance, whilst you would keep me in it. So that you have found a way (against the cu∣stom of great wits) to shew even a great deal of good nature with a great deal of good sense.</P>

<P>MR. Englefyld being upon his journey to London, tells me I must write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his desire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it so lately by the messenger you sent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair copy of the poem<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The original of it in blots, and with figures of the References from copy to copy, in Mr. Pope's hand, is yet extant, among other such Broüillons of Mr. Wy∣cherley's poems, corrected by him. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> on Dulness, which was not then finish'd, and which I should not care to hazard by the common post. Mr. En∣glefyld is ignorant of the contents, and I hope your prudence will let him remain so, for my sake no less than your own: since if you should reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder reports should be rais'd, and there are those (I fear) who would be ready to im∣prove them to my disadvantage. I am sorry you told the great man, whom you met in the court of requests, that your papers were in my hands: no man alive shall ever know any
<PB N="29" REF="61"/>
such thing from me; and I give you this warn∣ing besides, that tho' yourself should say I had any ways assisted you, I am notwithstanding resolv'd to deny it.</P>
<P>The method of the copy I send you is very different from what it was, and much more re∣gular: for the better help of your memory, I desire you to compare it by the figures in the margin, answering to the same in this letter. The poem is now divided into four parts, mark'd with the literal figures 1. 2. 3. 4. The first contains the Praise of Dulness, and shews how upon several suppositions it passes for 1. religion. 2. philosophy. 3. example. 4. wit. and 5. the cause of wit, and the end of it. The second part contains the Advantages of Dul∣ness; 1st, in business; and 2dly, at Court; where the similitudes of the Byass of a bowl, and the Weights of a clock, are directly tending to the subject, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of those ad∣vantages (which was your only objection to my adding them.) The third contains the Happiness of Dulness in all stations, and shews in a great many particulars, that it is so fortu∣nate as to be esteem'd some good quality or other in all sorts of people; that it is thought quiet, sense, caution, policy, prudence, majesty, valour, circumspection, honesty, &amp;c. The
<PB N="30" REF="62"/>
fourth part I have wholly added, as a climax which sums up all the praise, advantage, and happiness of Dulness in a few words, and strengthens them by the opposition of the dis∣grace, disadvantage, and unhappiness of Wit, with which it concludes <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the present Edition: Some of the lines are these:
<LG>
<L>"Thus Dulness, the safe opiate of the mind,</L>
<L>"The last kind refuge weary wit can find;</L>
<L>"Fit for all stations, and in each content,</L>
<L>"Is satisfy'd, secure, and innocent;</L>
<L>"No pains it takes, and no offence it gives,</L>
<L>"Unfear'd, unhated, undisturb'd it lives, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho' the whole be as short again as at first, there is not one thought omitted, but what is a repetition of something in your first volume, or in this very paper: some thoughts are contract∣ed, where they seem'd encompass'd with too many words; and some new express'd, or add∣ed, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll see particularly in the Simile of the clock-weights <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>It was originally thus express'd:
<Q><L>"As Clocks run fastest when most lead is on."</L></Q>
in a Letter of Mr. Pope to Mr. Wycherley, dated April 3, 1705, and in a paper of verses of his, To the Author of a poem call'd Successio, which got out in a Miscellany in 1712, three years before Mr. Wycherley died, and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publish∣ing any poems. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>These two similes of the <HI>Biass of a Bowl,</HI> and the <HI>Weights of a Clock</HI> were at length put into the first book of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> And thus we have the history of their birth, fortunes, and final establishment.</P></NOTE>) and the versification through∣out
<PB N="31" REF="63"/>
is, I believe, such as no body can be shock'd at. The repeated permissions you give me of dealing freely with you, will (I hope) excuse what I have done: for if I have not spar'd you when I thought severity would do you a kindness, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no absolute need of am∣putation. As to particulars, I can satisfy you better when we meet; in the mean time pray write to me when you can, you cannot too often.</P>

<P>YOU may see by my style, I had the happi∣ness and satisfaction to receive yesterday, by the hands of Mr. Englefyld, your extreme kind and obliging letter of the 20th of this month; which, like all the rest of yours, did at once mortify me, and make me vain; since it tells me with so much more wit, sense, and kindness than mine can express, that my letters
<PB N="32" REF="64"/>
are always welcome to you. So that even whilst your kindness invites me to write to you, your wit and judgment forbid me; since I may return you a letter, but never an answer.</P>
<P>Now, as for my owning your assistance to me, in over-looking my unmusical numbers, and harsher sense, and correcting them both with your genius, or judgment; I must tell you I always own it (in spite of your unpoetic mo∣desty) who would do with your friendship as your charity; conceal your bounty to magnify the obligation; and even whilst you lay on your friend the favour, acquit him of the debt: but that shall not serve your turn; I will always own, 'tis my infallible Pope has, or would re∣deem me from a poetical damning, the second time; and save my rhimes from being con∣demn'd to the critics flames to all eternity; but (by the faith you profess) you know your works of supererogation, transfer'd upon an humble, acknowledging sinner, may save even him: having good works enough of your own be∣sides, to ensure yours, and their immortality.</P>
<P>And now for the pains you have taken to recommend my Dulness, by making it more methodical, I give you a thousand thanks; since true and natural dulness is shown more by its pretence to form and method, as the spright∣liness

I thank you a thousand times for your repeated invita∣tions to come to Binfield: You will find, it will be as hard for you to get quit of my mercena∣ry kindness to you, as it would for me to de∣serve, or return to yours; however it shall be the endeavour of my future life, as it will be to demonstrate myself</P>

<P>THE compliments you make me, in regard of any inconsiderable service I could do you, are very unkind, and do but tell me in other words, that my friend has so mean an opinion of me, as to think I expect acknow∣ledgments for trifles: which upon my faith I shall equally take amiss, whether made to my∣self, or to any other. For God's sake (my dear friend) think better of me, and believe I desire no sort of favour so much, as that of serving
<PB N="34" REF="66"/>
you more considerably than I have been yet able to do.</P>
<P>I shall proceed in this manner with some others of your pieces; but since you desire I would not deface your copy for the future, and only mark the repetitions; I must, as soon as I've mark'd these, transcribe what is left on an∣other paper; and in that, blot, alter, and add all I can devise, for their improvement. For you are sensible, the omission of Repetitions is but one, and the easiest part, of yours and my de∣sign; there remaining besides to rectify the Method, to connect the Matter, and to mend the Expression and Versification. I will go next upon the poems of Solitude, on the Public, and on the mixt Life; the bill of Fare; the praises of Avarice, and some others.</P>
<P>I must take notice of what you say, of "my pains to make your dulness methodical;" and of your hint, <Q>“that the sprightliness of wit despises method.”</Q> This is true enough, if by wit you mean no more than fancy or conceit; but in the better notion of wit, con∣sider'd as propriety, surely method is not only necessary for perspicuity and harmony of parts, but gives beauty even to the minute and par∣ticular thoughts, which receive an additional advantage from those which precede or follow in their due place. You remember a simile
<PB N="35" REF="67"/>
Mr. Dryden us'd in conversation, of feathers in the crowns of the wild Indians, which they not only chuse for the beauty of their colours, but place them in such a manner as to reflect a lu∣stre on each other. I will not disguise any of my sentiments from you: to methodize in your case, is full as necessary as to strike out; other∣wise you had better destroy the whole frame, and reduce them into single thoughts in prose, like Rochefoucault, as I have more than once hinted to you.</P>

<P>Now as to your excuse for the plainness of your style, I must needs tell you, that friendship is much more acceptable to a true friend than wit, which is generally false reasoning; and a friend's reprimand often shews more friendship than his compliment: nay love, which is more than friendship, is often seen by our friend's correction of our follies or crimes. Upon this test of your friendship I intend to put you when I return to London, and thence to you at Bin∣field, which, I hope, will be within a month.</P>

Therefore I am glad to find by your letter you design your country-beauty of a muse shall ap∣pear at court and in public: to out-shine all the farded, lewd, confident, affected Town-dow∣dies, who aim at being honour'd only to their shame: but her artful innocence (on the con∣trary) will gain more honour as she becomes public; and, in spite of custom, will bring mo∣desty again into fashion, or at least make her sister-rivals of this age blush for spite, if not for shame. As for my stale, antiquated, poeti∣cal puss, whom you would keep in counte∣nance by saying she has once been tolerable, and wou'd yet pass muster by a little licking over; it is true that (like most vain antiquated

<P>I Am glad you receiv'd the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jacob Tonson's sixth Vol. of Miscellany Poems. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> Miscellany, if it were only to show you that there are as bad poets in this nation as your servant. This modern custom of appearing in miscellanies, is very useful to the poets, who, like other thieves, escape by getting into a crowd, and herd toge∣ther like Banditti, safe only in their multitude. Methinks Strada has given a good description of these kind of collections; <HI>Nullus hodie mor∣talium aut nascitur, aut moritur, aut praeliatur, aut rusticatur, aut abit peregre, aut redit, aut nubit, aut est, aut non est, (nam etiam mortuis isti canunt) cui non illi extemplo cudant Epice∣dia, Genethliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, Epi∣thalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Soterica, Pa∣raenetica, Naenias, Nugas.</HI> As to the success which, you say, my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you was pleas'd to say of me to the world; which you do well to call your prophecy, since whatever is said in my favour, must be a prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can per∣form.

My pastoral Muse, like other country girls, is but put out of countenance, by what you courtiers say to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young scribler's vanity needs no recruits from abroad: for nature, like an indulgent mother, kindly takes care to supply her sons with as much of their own, as is necessary for their satisfaction. If my verses should meet with a few flying commendations, Virgil has taught me, that a young author has not too much reason to be pleas'd with them, when he considers that the natural consequence of praise is envy and calumny.

When once a man has appear'd as a poet, he may give up his pretensions to all the rich and thriving arts: those who have once made their court to those mistresses without portions, the Muses, are never like to set up for fortunes. But for my part, I shall be satisfy'd if I can lose my time agreeably this way, without losing my re∣putation: as for gaining any, I am as indiffer∣ent in the matter as Falstaffe was, and may say of fame as he did of honour, <Q>“If it comes, it comes unlook'd for; and there's an end on't.”</Q> I can be content with a bare saving

game, without being thought an eminent hand, (with which title Jacob has graciously digni∣fy'd his adventurers and voluntiers in poetry.)

The salt of your wit has been enough to give a relish to the whole insipid hotch-potch it is mingled with; and you will make Jacob's Ladder raise you to immortality, by which others are turn'd off shamefully to their dam∣nation (for poetic thieves as they are) who think to be sav'd by others good works, how faulty soever their own are: but the coffee∣house wits, or rather anti-wits the critics, prove their judgments by approving your wit; and even the news-mongers and poets will own, you have more invention than they; nay, the detracters or the envious, who never speak well of any body (not even of those they think well

<P>I Have had yours of the 30th of the last month, which is kinder than I desire it should be, since it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to
<PB N="47" REF="79"/>
be sick again in Town in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of hap∣piness than of health. Yet, my dear friend, set raillery or compliment aside, I can bear your absence (which procures your health and ease) better than I can your company when you are in pain: for I cannot see you so with∣out being so too. Your love to the Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope) my love to it or you, since there I can enjoy your com∣pany without seeing you in pain to give me sa∣tisfaction and pleasure; there I can have you without rivals or disturbers; without the too civil, or the too rude: without the noise of the loud, or the censure of the silent: and wou'd rather have you abuse me there with the truth, than at this distance with your compli∣ment: since now, your business of a friend, and kindness to a friend, is by finding fault with his faults, and mending them by your obli∣ging severity. I hope (in point of your good∣nature) you will have no cruel charity for those papers of mine, you are so willing to be trou∣bled with; which I take most infinitely kind of you, and shall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No friend can do more for his friend than preserving his reputation (nay, not by preserving his life) since by preserving
<PB N="48" REF="80"/>
his life he can only make him live about three∣score or fourscore years; but by preserving his reputation, he can make him live as long as the world lasts; so save him from damning, when he is gone to the devil. Therefore, I pray, condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their accomplices in Newgate, to save them from condemnation by the public. Be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical faults, and do with my papers, as you country-gentlemen do with your trees, slash, cut, and lop off the excres∣cencies and dead parts of my wither'd bays, that the little remainder may live the longer, and increase the value of them by diminishing the number. I have troubled you with my papers rather to give you pain than pleasure, notwithstanding your compliment, which says you take the trouble kindly: such is your ge∣nerosity to your friends, that you take it kind∣ly to be desired by them to do them a kind∣ness; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it them. Where∣fore you may be sure to be troubled with my letters out of interest, if not kindness; since mine to you will procure yours to me: so that I write to you more for my own sake than yours; less to make you think I write well, than to learn from you to write better. Thus you see interest in my kindness, which is like

In order to which (my dear friend) I beg you to be so kind to me, as to be severe to them; that the critics may be less so; for I had rather be condemn'd by my friend in private, than expos'd to my foes in public, the critics, or common judges, who are made such by having been old offenders themselves. Pray, believe I have as much faith in your friendship and sincerity, as I have de∣ference to your judgment; and as the best mark

Pray then take pity at once both of my readers and me, in short∣ning my barren abundance, and increasing their patience by it, as well as the obligations I have to you: And since no madrigaller can enter∣tain the head, unless he pleases the ear; and since the crowded Opera's have left the best Comedies with the leaft audiences, 'tis a sign sound can prevail over sense; therefore soften my words, and strengthen my sense, and

<P>I Receiv'd your most extreme kind letter but just now. It found me over those papers you mention, which have been my employ∣ment ever since Easter-monday: I hope before Michaelmas to have discharg'd my task; which, upon the word of a friend, is the most pleasing one I cou'd be put upon. Since you are so near going into Shropshire, (whither I shall not care to write of this matter for fear of the miscar∣riage of any letters) I must desire your leave to give you a plain and sincere account of what I have found from a more serious application to them. Upon comparison with the former volume, I find much more repeated than I till now imagin'd, as well as in the present vo∣lume, which, if (as you told me last) you would have me dash over with a line, will de∣face the whole copy extremely, and to a de∣gree that (I fear) may displease you. I have every where mark'd in the margins the page and line, both in this and the other part. But if you order me not to cross the lines, or would any way else limit my commission, you will oblige me by doing it in your next letter; for I am at once equally fearful of sparing you, and
<PB N="52" REF="84"/>
of offending you by too impudent a correction. Hitherto however I have cross'd 'em so as to be legible, because you bade me. When I think all the repetitions are struck out in a copy, I sometimes find more upon dipping in the first vo∣lume, and the number encreases so much, that, I believe, more shortning will be requisite than you may be willing to bear with, unless you are in good earnest resolv'd to have no thought repeated. Pray, forgive this freedom, which as I must be sincere in this case so I could not but take; and let me know if I am to go on at this rate, or if you would prescribe any other method.</P>
<P>I am very glad you continue your resolution of seeing me in my Hermitage this summer; the sooner you return, the sooner I shall be happy, which indeed my want of any company that is entertaining or esteemable, together with fre∣quent infirmities and pains, hinder me from being in your absence. 'Tis (I am sure) a real truth, that my sickness cannot make me quite weary of myself when I have you with me; and I shall want no company but yours, when you are here.</P>
<P>You see how freely and with how little care I talk rather than write to you: this is one of the many advantages of friendship, that one can say to one's friend the things that stand in need
<PB N="53" REF="85"/>
of pardon, and at the same time be sure of it. Indeed I do not know whether or no the let∣ters of friends are the worse for being fit for none else to read. 'Tis an argument of the trust reposed in a friend's good nature, when one writes such things to him as require a good por∣tion of it. I have experienced yours so often and so long, that I can now no more doubt of the greatness of it, than I hope you do of the greatness of my affection, or of the sincerity with which I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOU give me an account in your letter of the trouble you have undergone for me, in comparing my papers you took down with you, with the old printed volume, and with one another, of that bundle you have in your hands; amongst which (you say) you find nu∣merous Repetitions of the same thoughts and subjects; all which, I must confess, my want of memory has prevented me from imagining, as well as made me capable of committing: since, of all figures, that of Tautology is the last I would
<PB N="54" REF="86"/>
use, or least forgive myself for. But seeing is believing; wherefore I will take some pains to examine and compare those papers in your hands with one another, as well as with the former printed copies, or books of my damn'd Miscellanies; all which (as bad a memory as I have) with a little more pains and care I think I can remedy. Therefore I would not have you give yourself more trouble about them, which may prevent the pleasure you have, and may give the world in writing upon new subjects of your own, whereby you will much better entertain yourself and others. Now as to your remarks upon the whole volume of my papers; all that I desire of you is to mark in the margin (without defacing the copy at all) either any repetition of words, matter, or sense, or any thoughts, or words too much re∣peated; which if you will be so kind as to do for me, you will supply my want of Memory with your good one, and my deficiencies of sense, with the infallibility of yours; which if you do, you will most infinitely oblige me, who almost repent the trouble I have given you, since so much. Now as to what you call free∣dom with me, (which you desire me to forgive) you may be assur'd I would not forgive you unless you did use it; for I am so far from thinking your plainness an offence to me, that

Be certain I shall most care∣fully observe your request, not to cross over, or deface the copy of your papers for the fu∣ture, and only to mark in the margin the Re∣petitions. But as this can serve no further than to get rid of those repetitions, and no way rec∣tify the Method, nor connect the Matter, nor improve the Poetry in expression or numbers, without further blotting, adding, and alter∣ing; so it really is my opinion and desire, that you should take your papers out of my hands into your own, and that no alterations may be made but when both us are present; when you may be satisfied with every blot, as well as

<P>Do not be so unjust, as to imagine from hence that I would decline any part of this task; on the contrary you know, I have been at the pains of transcribing some pieces, at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the copy, and yet to lose no time in proceeding upon the correction. I will go on the same way, if you please; tho' truly it is (as I have often told you) my sincere opinion, that the greater part would make a much better figure as Single Maxims and Reflections in prose, af∣ter the manner of your favourite Rochefou∣cault, than in verse <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"> Mr. Wycherley lived five years after, to Decem∣ber, 1715, but little pro∣gress was made in this de∣sign, thro' his Old age, and the increase of his infirmi∣ties.

I hope, when I have the happiness of seeing you again in London, not only to read over the verses I have now of yours, but more that you have written since; for I make no doubt but any one who writes so well, must write more. Not that I think the most volu∣minous poets always the best; I believe the contrary is rather true. I mention'd somewhat to you in London of a Pastoral Comedy, which I should be glad to hear you had thought upon since. I find Menage in his observations up∣on Tasso's Aminta, reckons up fourscore pa∣storal plays in Italian: and in looking over my old Italian books, I find a great many pastor∣ral and piscatory plays, which, I suppose, Me∣nage reckons together. I find also by Menage, that Tasso is not the first that writ in that kind, he mentioning another before him which he himself had never seen, nor indeed have I. But as the Aminta, Pastor Fido, and Filli di Sciro of Bonarelli are the three best, so, I think, there is no dispute but Aminta is the best of the three: not but that the discourses in Pastor Fido are more entertaining and copious in several peo∣ple's opinion, tho' not so proper for pastoral; and the fable of Bonarelli more surprizing. I do not remember many in other languages, that have written in this kind with success. Racan's <HI>Bergeries</HI> are much inferior to his lyric
<PB N="60" REF="92"/>
poems; and the Spaniards are all too full of conceits. Rapin will have the design of pasto∣ral plays to be taken from the Cyclops of Eu∣ripides. I am sure there is nothing of this kind in English worth mentioning, and therefore you have that field open to yourself. You see I write to you without any sort of constraint or method, as things come into my head, and therefore use the same freedom with me, who am, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Windsor-Forest, <DATE>July 2, 1706.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those papers of mine. You have no less right to correct me, than the same hand that rais'd a tree has to prune it. I am convinced as well as you, that one may correct too much; for in poetry, as in painting, a man may lay colours one upon another, till they stiffen and deaden the piece. Besides, to bestow heightening on every part, is monstrous: some parts ought to be lower than the rest; and nothing looks more ridiculous than a work, where the
<PB N="61" REF="93"/>
thoughts, however different in their own na∣ture, seem all on a level: 'tis like a meadow newly mown, where weeds, grass, and flowers, are all laid even, and appear undistinguish'd. I believe too that sometimes our first thoughts are the best, as the first squeezing of the grapes makes the finest and richest wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of a Pastoral comedy, because, I think, the taste of our age will not relish a poem of that sort. People seek for what they call wit, on all subjects, and in all places; not considering that nature loves truth so well, that it hardly ever admits of flourishing: Conceit is to nature what paint is to beauty; it is not only needless, but impairs what it would improve. There is a certain majesty in simplicity which is far above all the quaintness of wit: insomuch that the critics have excluded wit from the loftiest poetry, as well as the lowest, and forbid it to the Epic no less than the Pastoral. I shou'd certainly dis∣please all those who are charm'd with Guarini and Bonarelli, and imitate Tasso not only in the simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the Fable too. If surprizing discoveries should have place in the story of a pastroal comedy, I believe it would be more agreeable to probabi∣lity to make them the effects of chance than of design; intrigue not being very consistent with
<PB N="62" REF="94"/>
that innocence, which ought to constitute a shepherd's character. There is nothing in all the Aminta (as I remember) but happens by mere accident; unless it be the meeting of Aminta with Sylvia at the fountain, which is the contrivance of Daphne; and even that is the most simple in the world: the contrary is observable in Pastor Fido, where Corisca is so perfect a mistress of intrigue, that the plot could not have been brought to pass without her. I am inclin'd to think the pastoral comedy has another disadvantage, as to the manners: its general design is to make us in love with the innocence of a rural life, so that to introduce shepherds of a vicious character must in some measure debase it; and hence it may come to pass, that even the virtuous characters will not shine so much, for want of being oppos'd to their contraries. These thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have reason to doubt them: but I hope your judgment will set me right.</P>
<P>I would beg your opinion too as to another point: it is, how far the liberty of borrowing may extend? I have defended it sometimes by saying, that it seems not so much the perfection of sense <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He should rather have said, <HI>the perfection of conception.</HI></NOTE>, to say things that had never been said before, as to express those best that have been
<PB N="63" REF="95"/>
said oftenest; and that writers, in the case of borrowing from others, are like trees which of themselves would produce only one sort of fruit, but by being grafted upon others may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes poetry flourish; but then poets, like merchants, should repay with something of their own what they take from others; not, like pyrates, make prize of all they meet.

<P>I Had sooner return'd you thanks for the fa∣vour of your letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my journey to Windsor; but I am now forced to put that quite off, being engaged to go to my
<PB N="64" REF="96"/>
corporation of Richmond in Yorkshire. I think you are perfectly in the right in your notions of Pastoral; but I am of opinion, that the redun∣dancy of wit you mention, tho' 'tis what pleases the common people, is not what ever pleases the best judges. Pastor Fido indeed has had more admirers than Aminta; but I will ven∣ture to say, there is a great deal of difference between the admirers of one and the other. Corisca, which is a character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pa∣storal; and Bonarelli's fancy of making his shepherdess in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the liberty of Borrowing; 'tis very evident the best Latin Poets have extended this very far; and none so far as Virgil, who is the best of them. As for the Greek Poets, if we cannot trace them so plainly, 'tis perhaps because we have none be∣fore them; 'tis evident that most of them bor∣rowed from Homer, and Homer has been ac∣cus'd of burning those that wrote before him, that his thefts might not be discover'd. The best of the modern Poets in all languages, are those that have the nearest copied the Ancients. Indeed in all the common subjects of Poetry, the thoughts are so obvious (at least if they are natural) that whoever writes last, must write
<PB N="65" REF="97"/>
things like what have been said before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the arts of eating and drinking, and accuse the mo∣derns of having stolen those inventions from them; it being evident in all such cases, that whoever liv'd first, must first find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q><L>unus et alter</L>
<L>Assuitur pannus,</L></Q>
when there are one or two bright thoughts stolen, and all the rest is quite different from it, a poem makes a very foolish figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Ancients so mix'd with that of the Moderns, that none can distinguish the one from the other, I can never find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a different opinion, and that I have shewn your verses to some who have made that objec∣tion to them. I have so much company round me while I write this, and such a noise in my ears, that 'tis impossible I should write any thing but nonsense, so must break off abruptly.</P>

<P>AT my return from the North I receiv'd the favour of your letter, which had lain there till then. Having been absent about six weeks, I read over your Pastorals again, with a great deal of pleasure, and to judge the better read Virgil's Eclogues, and Spenser's Calendar, at the same time; and, I assure you, I continue the same opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occasions to improve them, 'tis probable you will make them yet better against winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a man may correct his verses till he takes away the true spirit of them; especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great Cri∣tics, by mechanical rules, and never enter into the true design and Genius of an author. I have seen some of these, that would hardly al∣low any one good Ode in Horace, who cry Virgil wants fancy, and that Homer is very in∣correct. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the common rate of mortals: but generally they are great admirers of Ovid and Lucan; and when they write themselves, we find out all the mystery. They
<PB N="67" REF="99"/>
scan their verses upon their fingers; run after Conceits and glaring thoughts; their poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the first may be last, or the last first, without any sort of prejudice to their works; in which there is no design, or method, or any thing natural or just. For you are certainly in the right, that in all writings whatsoever (not poetry only) na∣ture is to be follow'd; and we should be jealous of ourselves for being fond of Similies, Con∣ceits, and what they call saying fine Things. When we were in the North, my Lord Whar∣ton shew'd me a letter he had receiv'd from a certain great General in Spain <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Peterborow.</NOTE>; I told him I would by all means have that General recall'd, and set to writing here at home, for it was im∣possible that a man with so much Wit as he shew'd, could be fit to command an Army, or do any other business <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Walsh's Remark will be thought very inno∣cent, when the reader is in∣formed that it was made on the Earl of Peterborow, just before the glorious cam∣paigns of Barcelona and Valentia. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. As for what you say of Expression: 'tis indeed the same thing to Wit, as Dress is to Beauty: I have seen many women over-dress'd, and several look better in a care∣less night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoiselle Spanheim dress'd for a ball. I do not design to be in London till
<PB N="68" REF="100"/>
towards the parliament: then I shall certainly be there; and hope by that time you will have finish'd your Pastorals as you would have them appear in the world, and particularly the third, of Autumn, which I have not yet seen. Your last Eclogue being upon the same subject as that of mine on Mrs. Tempest's Death, I shou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it were to the Memory of the same Lady, if they were not written for some parti∣cular Woman whom you would make immor∣tal. You may take occasion to shew the dif∣ference between Poets Mistresses, and other mens. I only hint this, which you may either do, or let alone just as you think fit. I shall be very much pleas'd to see you again in Town, and to hear from you in the mean time. I am, with very much esteem,</P>

<P>AFTER the thoughts I have already sent you on the subject of English Versifica∣tion, you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars. There are indeed certain Niceties, which, tho' not much observed even by correct versifiers, I cannot but think, deserve to be bet∣ter regarded.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="69" REF="101"/>
1. It is not enough that nothing offends the ear, but a good Poet will adapt the very Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may express it so) a Style of Sound. As in describing a gliding stream, the numbers should run easy and flowing; in describing a rough torrent or deluge, sonorous and swelling, and so of the rest. This is evident every where in Homer and Virgil, and no where else, that I know of, to any observable degree. The following ex∣amples will make this plain, which I have taken from <HI>Vida.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque sonoras.</L>
<L>Immenso cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle sine ictu, conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape saxa manu, cape robora, Pastor.</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas, data tela, repellite pestem.</L>
</LG>
<P>This, I think, is what very few observe in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting the image on the reader: We have one excellent example of it in our lan∣guage, Mr. Dryden's Ode on St. Caecilia's day, entitled, <HI>Alexander's Feast.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Every nice ear must (I believe) have ob∣serv'd, that in any smooth English verse of ten
<PB N="70" REF="102"/>
syllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pause</HI> at the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable. It is upon these the ear rests, and upon the judicious change and management of which depends the variety of versification. For example, At the fifth.
<Q><L>Where'er thy navy {barline} spreads her canvass wings,</L></Q>
At the fourth.
<Q><L>Homage to thee {barline} and peace to all she brings.</L></Q>
At the sixth.
<Q><L>Like tracts of leverets {barline} in morning snow.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now I fancy, that, to preserve an exact Har∣mony and Variety, the Pause at the 4th or 6th should not be continued above three lines toge∣ther, without the interposition of another; else it will be apt to weary the ear with one conti∣nued tone, at least it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite so dead a weight, so tires not so much, tho' it be conti∣nued longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to Exple∣tives, whether words or syllables, which are made use of purely to supply a vacancy: <HI>Do</HI> before verbs plural is absolutely such; and it is not improbable but future refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the same manner, which are al∣most always used for the sake of rhime. The same cause has occasioned the promiscuous use
<PB N="71" REF="103"/>
of <HI>you</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> to the same person, which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would also object to the irruption of Alexandrine verses, of twelve syllables, which, I think, should never be allow'd but when some remarkable beauty or propriety in them atones for the liberty: Mr. Dryden has been too free of these, especially in his latter works. I am of the same opinion as to Triple Rhimes.</P>
<P N="5">5. I could equally object to the Repetition of the same Rhimes within four or six lines of each other, as tiresome to the ear thro' their Monotony.</P>
<P N="6">6. Monosyllable Lines, unless very artfully managed, are stiff, or languishing: but may be beautiful to express Melancholy, Slowness, or Labour.</P>
<P N="7">7. To come to the Hiatus, or Gap between two words, which is caus'd by two vowels opening on each other (upon which you desire me to be particular) I think the rule in this case is either to use the Caesura, or admit the Hiatus, just as the ear is least shock'd by either: For the Caesura sometimes offends the ear more than the Hiatus itself, and our language is naturally overcharg'd with consonants: As for example; If in this verse,
<Q><PB N="72" REF="104"/>
<L>The old have Int'rest ever in their eye,</L></Q>
we should say, to avoid the Hiatus,
<Q><L>But th' old have int'rest.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Hiatus which has the worst effect, is when one word ends with the same vowel that begins the following; and next to this, those vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other, are most to be avoided. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know, some people will think these Observations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corroborate them by some great autho∣rities, which I have met with in Tully and Quintilian. In the fourth book of Rhetoric to Herennius, are these words: <HI>Fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones, quae vastam atque hiantem reddunt or ationem; ut hoc est, Baccae aeneae amoe∣nissimae impendebant.</HI> And Quintilian l. ix. cap. 4. <HI>Vocalium concursus cum accidit, hiat &amp; inter∣sistit, &amp; quasi laborat oratio. Pessimi longe quae easdem inter se literas committunt, sonabunt: Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efferuntur.</HI> E <HI>plenior litera est,</HI> I <HI>an∣gustior.</HI> But he goes on to reprove the excess on the other hand of being too solicitous in this matter, and says admirably, <HI>Nescio an negligen∣tia in hoc, aut solicitudo sit pejor.</HI> So likewise <HI>Tully (Orator. ad Brut.) Theopompum reprehen∣dunt,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="105"/>
<HI>quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, etsi idem magister ejus Socrates:</HI> which last author, as Turnebus on Quintilian observes, has hardly one Hiatus in all his works. Quintilian tells us, that Tully and Demosthenes did not much ob∣serve this nicety, tho' Tully himself says in his Orator, <HI>Crebra ista vocum concursio, quam magna ex parte vitiosam, fugit Demosthenes.</HI> If I am not mistaken, Malherbe of all the moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point; and I think Menage in his observations upon him says, he has not one in his poems. To con∣clude, I believe the Hiatus should be avoided with more care in poetry than in Oratory; and I would constantly try to prevent it, unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the sound than the Hiatus itself.</P>

<P>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many men when they leave the World, whose loss itself they do not so much regret, as that of their friends whom they leave behind in it. For I do not know one thing for which I can envy London, but for your continuing there. Yet I guess you will expect me to recant this expression, when I tell you that Sappho (by which heathenish name you have christen'd a very orthodox La∣dy) did not accompany me into the Country. Well, you have your Lady in the Town still, and I have my Heart in the Country still, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more
<PB N="75" REF="107" MS="y"/>
room in it for my friends, and does not want a corner at your service. You have extremely obliged me by your frankness and kindness; and if I have abus'd it by too much freedom on my part, I hope you will attribute it to the natural openness of my temper, which hardly knows how to show Respect, where it feels Af∣fection. I would love my Friend, as my Mi∣stress, without ceremony; and hope a little rough usage sometimes may not be more dis∣pleasing to the one, than it is to the other.</P>
<P>If you have any curiosity to know in what manner I live, or rather lose a life, Martial will inform you in one line:
<Q><L>Prandeo, poto, cano, ludo, lego, coeno, quiesco.</L></Q></P>
<P>Every day with me is literally another yes∣terday, for it is exactly the same: It has the same business, which is Poetry, and the same pleasure, which is Idleness. A man might in∣deed pass his time much better, but I question if any man could pass it much easier. If you will visit our shades this spring, which I very much desire, you may perhaps instruct me to manage my game more wisely; but at present I am satisfy'd to trifle away my time any way, rather than let it stick by me; as shop-keepers are glad to be rid of those goods at any rate, which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands.</P>

<P>YOU talk of fame and glory, and of the great men of Antiquity: Pray, tell me, what are all your great dead men, but so many little living letters? What a vast reward is here for all the ink wasted by Writers, and all the blood spilt by Princes? There was in old time one Severus a Roman Emperor. I dare say you never call'd him by any other name in your life: and yet in his days he was styled Lucius, Septimius, Severus, Pius, Pertinax, Augustus, Parthicus, Adiabenicus, Arabicus, Maximus, and what not? What a prodigious waste of letters has time made! what a number have here dropt off, and left the poor surviving seven unattended!

<P>I Have been so well satisfy'd with the Coun∣try ever since I saw you, that I have not once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it besides Mr. Wycherley and yourself. And from him I understand of your journey this summer into Leicestershire; from whence I guess you are return'd by this time, to your old apartment in the widow's corner, to your old business of comparing Critics, and recon∣ciling Commentators, and to your old diversions of a losing game at picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the thea∣tre: where you are none of the malicious audi∣ence, but the chief of amorous spectators; and

according to the poetical, not the learned, Dodwell; who has done one thing worthy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense!] So you have the ad∣vantage of being entertain'd with all the beau∣ty of the boxes, without being troubled with any of the dulness of the stage. You are so good a critic, that 'tis the greatest happiness of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works: and next, that you are not so arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the rest) without hearing. But now I talk of those critics, I have good news to tell you concerning myself, for which I expect you should congratulate with me: It is that, beyond all my expectations, and far above my demerits, I have been most mer∣cifully repriev'd by the sovereign power of Ja∣cob Tonson, from being brought forth to pub∣lic punishment; and respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous executioners of the Muses, whom I was just now speaking
<PB N="80" REF="112"/>
of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty Criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver themselves into the hands of justice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage; and not out of any ambition to spread their fame, by being executed in the face of the world, which is a fame but of short continuance. That Poet were a happy man who could but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninety-nine years; for those names very rarely last so many days, which are planted either in Jacob Tonson's, or the Ordi∣nary of Newgate's Miscellanies.</P>
<P>I have an hundred things to say to you, which shall be deferr'd till I have the happiness of seeing you in town, for the season now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had communicated to you by letters before this, if I had not been uncertain where you pass'd your time the last season: So much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the pleasure you could desire from the country, and your own thoughts the best company in it. But nothing could allure Mr. Wycherley to our forest, he continued (as you told me long since he would) an obstinate lover of the town, in spite of friendship and fair weather. There∣fore henceforward, to all those considerable qualities I know you possess'd of, I shall add

that of Prophecy. But I still believe Mr. Wy∣cherley's intentions were good, and am satis∣fy'd that he promises nothing, but with a real design to perform it: how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imita∣tion, his sincerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmost that I am,</P>

<P>I Had sent you the inclos'd<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was a translation of the first book of Statius, done when the author was but fourteen years old, as appears by an advertisement before the first edition of it in a miscellany publish'd by B.

I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber, and to be very free of your re∣marks in the margins, not only in regard to the
<PB N="82" REF="114"/>
accuracy, but to the fidelity of the translation; which I have not had time to compare with its original. And I desire you to be the more se∣vere, as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense, that to do it in my own proper person. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire version of the first book. There is an omission from the 168th line—<HI>Jam mur∣mura serpunt Plebis Agenoreae</HI>—to the 312th—<HI>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>—(between these<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">These he since translated, and they are extant in the printed version. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> two Statius has a description of the coun∣cil of the Gods, and a speech of Jupiter; which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty, and were left out for no other reason, but because the consequence of this machine appears not till the second book.) The translation goes on from thence to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam,</HI> where there is an odd ac∣count of a battle at fifty-cuffs between the two Princes on a very slight occasion, and at a time when, one would think, the fatigue of their jour∣ney, in so tempestuous a night, might have ren∣der'd them very unfit for such a scuffle. This I had actually translated, but was very ill satis∣fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of con∣science;
<PB N="83" REF="115"/>
it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words—<HI>Hic primum lustrare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.—to the end of the book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt not, that Statius was none of the discreetest Poets, tho' he was the best verfifier next Virgil: In the very begin∣ning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry (which Horace had already taught the Romans) when he asks his Muse where to begin his Thebaid, and seems to doubt whether it should not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo.</HI> When he comes to the scene of his Poem, and the prize in dispute between the brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it—<HI>Pugna est de paupere regno.</HI>—Very different from the con∣duct of his master Virgil, who at the entrance of his Poem informs his reader of the greatness of its subject.—<HI>Tantae molis erat Romanam con∣dere gentem.</HI> [Bossu on Epic Poetry.] There are innumerable little faults in him, among which I cannot but take notice of one in this book, where, speaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers, he says, <HI>The whole world would be too small a prize to repay so much impiety.</HI></P>

I shall be extremely glad if the reading this can be any amusement to you, the rather because I had the dissatisfaction to hear you have been confin'd to your chamber by an illness, which, I fear, was as troublesome a companion as I have sometimes been in the same place; where, if ever you found any pleasure in my company, it must surely have been that, which most men take in ob∣serving the faults and follies of another; a plea∣sure, which, you see, I take care to give you even in my absence.</P>

The first I imagin'd you might have had before now, but since the contrary has hap∣pen'd, you may draw this moral from it, That authors in general are more ready to write non∣sense than booksellers are to publish it. I had
<PB N="86" REF="118"/>
I know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together, in which time all the verses you see added, have been written; which I tell you, that you may more freely be severe upon them. 'Tis a mercy I do not assault you with a number of original Sonnets and Epigrams, which our modern bards put forth in the spring-time, in as great abund∣ance, as trees do blossoms, a very few where∣of ever come to the fruit, and please no longer than just in their birth. They make no less haste to bring their flowers of wit to the press, than gardeners to bring their other flowers to the market, which if they can't get off their hands in the morning are sure to die before night. Thus the same reason that furnishes Covent-garden with those nosegays you so de∣light in, supplies the <HI>Muses Mercury</HI> and <HI>Bri∣tish Apollo</HI> (not to say <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Miscellanies) with verses. And it is the happiness of this age, that the modern invention of printing po∣ems for pence a-piece, has brought the nose∣gays of Parnassus to bear the same price; where∣by the publick-spirited Mr. Henry Hills of Black-friars has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the learned, who never over-abounding in transitory coin, should not be discontented (methinks) even tho' po∣ems were distributed gratis about the streets,
<PB N="87" REF="119"/>
like Bunyan's sermons and other pious treatises, usually publish'd in a like volume and cha∣racter.</P>
<P>The time now drawing nigh, when you use with Sappho to cross the water in an evening to Spring-garden, I hope you will have a fair op∣portunity of ravishing her:—I mean only (as Oldfox in the Plain-dealer says) thro' the ear, with your well-penn'd verses. I wish you all the pleasures which the season and the nymph can afford; the best company, the best coffee, and the best news you can desire: and what more to wish you than this, I do not know; unless it be a great deal of patience to read and examine the verses I send you: I promise you in return a great deal of deference to your judg∣ment, and an extraordinary obedience to your sentiments for the future, (to which, you know, I have been sometimes a little refractory.) If you will please to begin where you left off last, and mark the margins, as you have done in the pages immediately before (which you will find corrected to your sense since your last perusal) you will extremely oblige me, and improve my translation. Besides those places which may deviate from the sense of the author, it would be very kind in you to observe any deficiencies in the diction or numbers. The Hiatus in particular I would avoid as much as possible, to
<PB N="88" REF="120"/>
which you are certainly in the right to be a profess'd enemy: tho', I confess, I could not think it possible at all times to be avoided by any writer, till I found by reading Malherbe lately, that there is scarce any throughout his poems. I thought your observation true enough to be pass'd into a rule, but not a rule without exceptions, nor that ever it had been reduced to practice: But this example of one of the most correct and best of their Poets has unde∣ceived me, and confirms your opinion very strongly, and much more than Mr. Dryden's authority, who, tho' he made it a rule, sel∣dom observ'd it.</P>

<P>One of your objections, namely on that pas∣sage,

<PB N="89" REF="121" MS="y"/>
may be well grounded, in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words—<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the first book of Sta∣tius, ℣ 302. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Caetera reliquae ordine ducam.</HI> But the duration of the Action of Statius's poem may as well be ex∣cepted against, as many things besides in him: (which I wonder Bossu<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bossu did not write a critique upon Statius, but on∣ly used him, as he did other poets occasionally, for an example. So that it is no wonder there should be faults and beauties in Statius which he did not take notice of.</NOTE> has not observ'd) for instead of confining his narration to <HI>one year,</HI> it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books: The narration begins with Oedipus's prayer to the Fury to promote discord betwixt his sons; afterward the Poet expresly describes their entring into the agreement of reigning a year by turns; and Polynices takes his flight from Thebes on his brother's refusal to resign the throne. All this is in the first book; in the next Tydeus is sent ambassador to Eteocles, and demands his resignation in these terms,</P>

</LG>
<P>But Bossu himself is mistaken in one parti∣cular, relating to the commencement of the action; saying in book ii. cap. 8. that Statius
<PB N="90" REF="122"/>
opens it with Europa's Rape, whereas the Poet at most only deliberates whether he should or not <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">That was the same to Bossu's purpose; which was only to shew, that there were epic Poets so ignorant, or negligent of composition, as not to know where their sub∣ject should begin.</NOTE>?</P>

Indeed there are numberless particulars blame∣worthy in our author, which I have try'd to soften in the version:
<Q><L>dubiamque jugo fragor impulit Oeten</L>
<L>In latus, &amp; geminis vix fluctibus obstitit Isthmus,</L></Q>

<P>THE morning after I parted from you, I found myself (as I had prophesied) all alone, in an uneasy Stage-coach; a doleful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the least hope of en∣tertainment but from my last recourse in such cases, a book. I then began to enter into ac∣quaintance with your Moralists, and had just receiv'd from them some cold consolation for the inconveniencies of this life, and the uncertainty of human affairs; when I perceiv'd my vehi∣cle to stop, and heard from the side of it the
<PB N="92" REF="124"/>
dreadful news of a sick woman preparing to en∣ter it. 'Tis not easy to guess at my mortifica∣tion, but being so well fortify'd with philoso∣phy, I stood resign'd with a stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils, a sick woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dress, that she was young and a gen∣tlewoman; but no sooner was her hood re∣mov'd, but I saw one of the finest faces I ever beheld, and, to increase my surprize, heard her salute me by my name. I never had more rea∣son to accuse nature for making me short sight∣ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well, and was utterly at a loss how to address myself; till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know (even before I dis∣cover'd my ignorance) that she was the daugh∣ter of one in our neighbourhood, lately mar∣ry'd, who having been consulting her physi∣cians in town, was returning into the country, to try what good air and a husband could do to recover her. My father, you must know, has sometimes recommended the study of phy∣sic to me, but I never had any ambition to be a doctor till this instant. I ventur'd to prescribe some fruit (which I happen'd to have in the coach) which being forbidden her by her doc∣tors, she had the more inclination to. In short,
<PB N="93" REF="125"/>
I tempted, and she eat; nor was I more like the Devil than she like Eve. Having the good success of the 'foresaid Tempter before my eyes, I put on the gallantry of the old serpent, and in spite of my evil form accosted her with all the gaiety I was master of; which had so good effect, that in less than an hour she grew plea∣sant, her colour return'd, and she was pleas'd to say my prescription had wrought an imme∣diate cure: In a word, I had the pleasantest journey imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus far (methinks) my letter has some∣thing of the air of a romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what follows as the greatest of truths, that I think myself ex∣tremely obliged by you in all points; especially for your kind and honourable information and advice in a matter of the utmost concern to me, which I shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship, justice, and sin∣cerity. At the same time be assur'd, that Gentle∣man<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wycherley.—From his last letters to Mr. Pope, the Reader may perceive something of a growing cold∣ness and disgust, apparently proceeding from the liberties his young friend had taken with his versification and composition.

<P>But in one thing, I must confess you have yourself obliged me more than any man, which is, that you have shew'd me many of my faults, to which as you are the more an implacable enemy, by so much the more you are a kind friend to me. I could be proud, in revenge, to find a few slips in your verses, which I read in London, and since in the country, with more application and pleasure: the thoughts are very just, and you are sure not to let them suffer by the versification. If you would oblige me with the trust of any thing of yours, I should be glad to execute any commissions you would

<P>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my letters would be as bad as a rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your good-nature, the other would be too much for your quiet, which is one blessing good-nature should indispensably receive from mankind, in return for those many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in speaking well of me in my absence; the only thing by which you prove yourself no wit nor critic: tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will show just as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am absent, as he does severity to 'em when I am present. To be
<PB N="97" REF="131"/>
very frank with you, Sir, I must own, that where I receiv'd so much civility at first, I could hard∣ly have expected so much sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wish, that the last were but equal to the first, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, so you would omit nothing to improve me.</P>
<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to enquire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your speculative angle in the Widow's Coffee-house, and bid∣ing adieu for some time to all the Rehearsals, Reviews, Gazettes, &amp;c. have march'd off into Lincolnshire. Thus I find you vary your life in the scene at least, tho' not in the action; for tho' life for the most part, like an old play, be still the same, yet now and then a new scene may make it more entertaining. As for myself, I would not have my life a very regular play, let it be<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tolerable farce,</HI> in the Author's own Edit. <HI>a God's name</HI> omitted there. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> a good merry farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical unities! For the gene∣rality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither tragedy, comedy, nor farce, nor one, nor all of these; every actor is much better known by his having the same face, than by keeping the same character: for we change our minds as often as they can their
<PB N="98" REF="132"/>
parts, and he who was yesterday Caesar, is to day Sir John Daw. So that one might ask the same question of a modern life, that Rich did of a modern play; <Q>“Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me; Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?”</Q></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this, because I persuade myself it might be useful, at a time when we have no theatre, to divert ourselves at this great one. Here is a glorious standing comedy of Fools, at which every man is hear∣tily merry, and thinks himself an unconcern'd spectator. This (to our singular comfort) nei∣ther my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen herself can ever shut up, or silence.—<SUP>a</SUP> While that of Drury (alas!) lies desolate, in the pro∣foundest peace: and the melancholy prospect of the nymphs yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no less moving than that of the Trojan dames lamenting over their ruin'd Ilium! What now can they hope, dispossess'd of their ancient seats, but to serve as captives to the insulting victors of the Hay-market? The afflicted subjects of France do not, in our Post∣man, so grievously deplore the obstinacy of their arbitrary monarch, as these perishing people of Drury, the obdurate heart of that Pharoah, <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>b</SUP> What follows to the end of this Letter, is omitted in the Author's own Edit. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>

Rich, who, like him, disdains all proposals of peace and accommodation. Several libels have been secretly affixed to the great gates of his imperial palace in Bridges-street; and a me∣morial, representing the distresses of these per∣sons, has been accidentally dropt (as we are credibly informed by a person of quality) out of his first minister the chief box-keeper's poc∣ket, at a late conference of the said person of quality and others, on the part of the Confe∣derates, and his Theatrical Majesty on his own part. Of this you may expect a copy, as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congress, it is here re∣ported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of so ma∣ny wretched ladies may induce this haughty prince to reason.</P>

<P>I May truly say I am more obliged to you this summer than to any of my acquaint∣ance, for had it not been for the two kind let∣ters you sent me, I had been perfectly <HI>oblitus∣que</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="134"/>
<HI>que meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis.</HI> The only companions I had were those Muses, of whom Tully says, <HI>Adolescentiam alunt, senectutem ob∣lectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent, delectant domi, non impe∣diunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur:</HI> which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them: For the Muses, if you take them as companions, are very pleasant and agreeable; but whoever should be forced to live or depend upon 'em, would find himself in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which Cow∣ley calls the <HI>Companion of Obscurity,</HI> was not wanting to me, unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess I had for our friend's welfare. 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more anxiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinced by his long silence. However, the love of some things rewards itself, as of virtue, and of Mr. Wycherley. I am surprized at the danger, you tell me, he has been in, and must agree with you, that our nation would have lost in him, as much wit and probity, as would have remain'd (for aught I know) in the rest of it. My concern for his friendship will excuse me (since I know you honour him so much, and since you know I love him above all men)
<PB N="101" REF="135"/>
if I vent a part of my uneasiness to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one, to insinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. Wy∣cherley, which, I fear, may have had some ef∣fect upon him. If so, he will have a greater punishment for his credulity than I could wish him, in that fellow's acquaintance. The loss of a faithful creature is something, tho' of ever so contemptible an one; and if I were to change my dog for such a man as the aforesaid, I should think my dog undervalued: (who fol∣lows me about as constantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. Wycherley in the town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a worse subject, which my spleen tempts me to, I will give you some account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, since Mon∣taigne (to whom I am but a dog in compari∣son) has done the same thing of his Cat. <HI>Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam?</HI> You are to know then, that as 'tis likeness begets affection, so my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the finest shap'd. He is not much a spaniel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate him in) a dumb surly sort of kindness, that rather shows itself when he thinks me ill-us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by
<PB N="102" REF="136"/>
ourselves. If it be the chief point of friendship to comply with a friend's motions and inclina∣tions, he possesses this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I sit, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witness our walk a year ago in St. James's Park.—Histories are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends, but I will not insist upon many of them, because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of Pylades and Orestes, &amp;c. I will only say for the honour of dogs, that the two most antient and esteemable books, sacred and prophane, extant (viz. the Scripture and Ho∣mer) have shewn a particular regard to these animals. That of Toby is the more remark∣able, because there seem'd no manner of rea∣son to take notice of the dog, besides the great humanity of the author. Homer's account of Ulysses's dog Argus is the most pathetic ima∣ginable, all the circumstances consider'd, and an excellent proof of the old bard's good∣nature. Ulysses had left him at Ithaca when he embark'd for Troy, and found him at his re∣turn after twenty years (which by the way is not unnatural, as some critics have said, since I remember the dam of my dog was twenty-two years old when she dy'd: May the omen of

<P>Plutarch relating how the Athenians were obliged to abandon Athens in the time of The∣mistocles, steps back again out of the way of his history, purely to describe the lamentable cries and howlings of the poor dogs they left behind. He makes mention of one, that follow'd his

master across the sea to Salamis, where he dy'd, and was honour'd with a tomb by the Athenians, who gave the name of the Dog's Grave to that part of the island where he was buried. This respect to a dog in the most po∣lite people of the world, is very observable. A modern instance of gratitude to a dog (tho' we have but few such) is, that the chief order of Denmark (now injuriously call'd the order of the Elephant) was instituted in memory of the fidelity of a dog, nam'd Wild-brat, to one of their Kings who had been deserted by his sub∣jects: he gave his Order this motto, or to this effect (which still remains) <HI>Wild-brat was faith∣ful.</HI> Sir William Trumbull has told me a sto∣ry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sir Philip Warwick tells this story in his Memoirs.</NOTE> which he heard from one that was present: King Charles I. being with some of his court during his troubles, a discourse arose what sort of dogs deserv'd pre-eminence, and it being on all hands agreed to belong either to the spaniel or grey-hound, the King gave his opinion on the part of the grey-hound, because (said he) it has all the Good-nature of the other without the Fawning.

<P>I Had written to you sooner, but that I made some scruple of sending profane things to you in holy week. Besides, our family would have been scandaliz'd to see me write, who take it for granted I write nothing but ungodly verses. I assure you, I am look'd upon in the neighbourhood for a very well-dispos'd person, no great Hunter indeed, but a great admirer of the noble sport, and only unhappy in my want of constitution for that, and Drinking. They all say, 'tis pity I am so sickly, and I think 'tis pity they are so healthy. But I say nothing that may destroy their good opinion of me: I have not quoted one Latin author since I came down, but have learn'd without book a song of Mr. Thomas Durfey's, who is your only Poet of to∣lerable reputation in this country.

<P>I Had not so long omitted to express my ac∣knowledgments to you for so much good∣nature and friendship as you lately show'd me; but that I am but just return'd to my own her∣mitage, from Mr. C*'s, who has done me so many favours, that I am almost inclin'd to think my friends infect one another, and that your conversation with him has made him as obliging to me as yourself. I can assure you, he has a sincere respect for you, and this, I be∣lieve, he has partly contracted from me, who am too full of you not to overflow upon those I converse with. But I must now be contented to converse only with the dead of this world, that is to say, the dull and obscure, every way obscure, in their intellects as well as their per∣sons: or else have recourse to the living dead, the old Authors with whom you are so well ac∣quainted, even from Virgil down to Aulus Gel∣lius, whom I do not think a critic by any
<PB N="108" REF="142"/>
means to be compar'd to Mr. Dennis: And I must declare positively to you, that I will per∣sist in this opinion, till you become a little more civil to Atticus. Who could have imagin'd, that he, who had escap'd all the misfortunes of his time, unhurt even by the proscriptions of Antony and Augustus, should in these days find an enemy more severe and barbarous than those tyrants? and that enemy the gentlest too, the best-natur'd of mortals, Mr. Cromwell, whom I must in this compare once more to Augustus; who seem'd not more unlike him∣self, in the severity of one part of his life and the clemency of the other, than you. I leave you to reflect on this, and hope that time (which mollifies rocks, and of stiff things makes limber) will turn a resolute critic to a gentle reader; and instead of this positive, tremen∣dous, new-fashion'd Mr. Cromwell, restore un∣to us our old acquaintance, the soft, beneficent, and courteous Mr. Cromwell.</P>
<P>I expect much, towards the civilizing of you in your critical capacity, from the innocent air and tranquillity of our Forest, when you do me the favour to visit it. In the mean time, it would do well by way of preparative, if you would duly and constantly every morning read over a pastoral of Theocritus or Virgil; and let the lady Isabella put your Macrobius and

Aulus Gellius somewhere out of your way, for a month or so. Who knows, but travelling and long airing in an open field, may contribute more successfully to the cooling a critic's seve∣rity, than it did to the assuaging of Mr. Cheek's anger, of old?

<P>AFTER I had recover'd from a dangerous illness which was first contracted in town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I trou∣bled you with a letter, and<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Verses on Silence, in imitation of the Earl of Ro∣chester's poem on Nothing; done at fourteen years old. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> paper inclos'd, which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last I saw you, promising me in return some translations of yours from Ovid. Since when, I have not had a syllable from your hands, so that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have escap'd death, I have not oblivion. I should at least have expected you to have finish'd that elegy upon me, which, you told me, you was upon the point of beginning when I was sick in London; if you will but do so much for me
<PB N="110" REF="144"/>
first, I will give you leave to forget me after∣wards; and for my own part will die at discre∣tion, and at my leisure. But I fear I must be forced, like many learned authors, to write my own epitaph, if I would be remember'd at all. Monsieur de la Fontaine's would fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of sacrilege (do you think it is not?) to steal epitaphs. In my present, liv∣ing dead condition, nothing would be properer than <HI>Oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis,</HI> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civilities I received from yourself, and some others. They say indeed 'tis one quality of ge∣nerous minds to forget the obligations they have conferr'd, and perhaps too it may be so to for∣get those on whom they conferr'd 'em: Then indeed I must be forgotten to all intents and purposes! I am, it must be own'd, dead in a natural capacity, according to Mr. Bickerstaff; dead in a poetical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity as a useless member of the Commonwealth. But reflect, dear Sir, what melancholy effects may ensue, if dead men are not civil to one another! If he who has nothing to do himself, will not comfort and support another in his idleness: If those who are to die themselves, will not now and then pay the charity of visiting a tomb and a dead friend, and strowing a few flowers over him:
<PB N="111" REF="145"/>
In the shades where I am, the Inhabitants have a mutual compassion for each other; being all alike Inanes; we saunter to one another's habi∣tations, and daily assist each other in doing no∣thing at all. This I mention for your edifica∣tion and example, that all alive as you are, you may not sometimes disdain—<HI>desipere in loco.</HI> Tho' you are no Papist, and have not so much regard to the dead as to address yourself to them (which I plainly perceive by your silence) yet I hope you are not one of those heterodox, who hold them to be totally insensible of the good offices and kind wishes of their living friends, and to be in a dull state of sleep, without one dream of those they left behind them.

<P>'TIS very natural for a young friend, and a young lover, to think the persons they love have nothing to do but to please them; when perhaps they, for their parts, had twenty other engagements before. This was my case when I wonder'd I did not hear from you; but I no sooner receiv'd your short letter, but I for∣got your long silence: and so many fine things as you said of me could not but have wrought a cure on my own sickness, if it had not been of the nature of that, which is deaf to the voice of the charmer. 'Twas impossible you could have better tim'd your compliment on my phi∣losophy; it was certainly properest to commend me for it just when I most needed it, and when I could least be proud of it; that is, when I was in pain. 'Tis not easy to express what an ex∣altation it gave to my spirits, above all the cor∣dials of my doctor; and 'tis no compliment to tell you, that your compliments were sweeter than the sweetest of his juleps and syrups.

Nevertheless I would not have you entirely lay aside the thoughts of my epitaph, any more than I do those of the probability of my be∣coming (e're long) the subject of one. For death has of late been very familiar with some of my size; I am told my Lord Lumley and Mr. Litton are gone before me; and tho' I may now, without vanity, esteem myself the least thing like a man in England, yet I can't but be sorry, two heroes of such a make should die inglorious in their beds; when it had been a fate more worthy our size, had they met with their from an irruption of Cranes, or other warlike animals, those ancient enemies to our Pygmaean ancestors! You of a superior species little regard what befals us <HI>homunciones sesqui∣pedales;</HI> however, you have no reason to be so unconcern'd, since all physicians agree there is no greater sign of a plague among men, than a mortality among frogs. I was the other day in company with a lady, who rally'd my per∣son so much, as to cause a total subversion of my countenance: some days after, to be re∣venged on her, I presented her, among other company, the following Rondeau on that oc∣casion, which I desire you to show Sappho.</P>
<LG>
<L>You know where you did despise</L>
<L>(T'other day) my little eyes,</L>

Little legs, and little thighs,</L>
<L>And some things of little size,</L>

<L>You, 'tis true, have fine black eyes,</L>
<L>Taper legs, and tempting thighs,</L>
<L>Yet what more than all we prize</L>
<L>Is a thing of little size,</L>
<L>You know where.</L>
</LG>
<P>This sort of writing call'd the Rondeau is what I never knew practis'd in our nation, and, I verily believe, it was not in use with the Greeks or Romans, neither Macrobius nor Hyginus taking the least notice of it. 'Tis to be ob∣serv'd, that the vulgar spelling and pronouncing it Round O, is a manifest corruption, and by no means to be allow'd of by critics. Some may mistakenly imagine that it was a sort of Rondeau which the Gallick soldiers sung in Caesar's triumph over Gaul—<HI>Gallias Caesar sub∣egit,</HI> &amp;c. as it is recorded by Suetonius in Ju∣lio, and so derive its original from the ancient Gauls to the modern French: but this is erro∣neous; the words there not being ranged ac∣cording to the Laws of the Rondeau, as laid down by Clement Marot. If you will say, that the song of the soldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of poem, and so consequently imperfect, neither Heinsius nor I
<PB N="115" REF="149"/>
can be of that opinion; and so I conclude, that we know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I ask your pardon for all this buf∣foonery, which I could not address to any one so well as to you, since I have found by experi∣ence, you most easily forgive my impertinencies. 'Tis only to show you that I am mindful of you at all times, that I write at all times; and as nothing I can say can be worth your read∣ing, so I may as well throw out what comes uppermost, as study to be dull.</P>

<P>I Give you thanks for the version you sent me of Ovid's elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeable∣ness that charms us without correctness, like a mistress, whose faults we see, but love her with them all. You have very judiciously alter'd his methods in some places, and I can find nothing which I dare insist upon as an error: what I have written in the margins being merely
<PB N="117" REF="151"/>
guesses at a little improvement, rather than cri∣ticisms. I assure you I do not expect you should subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge them agreeable to reason and good sense. What I have done is not as a critic, but as a friend; I know too well how many qualities are requisite to make the one, and that I want almost all I can reckon up; but I am sure I do not want inclination, nor, I hope, capacity, to be the other. Nor shall I take it at all amiss, that another dissents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in understanding, he becomes the more every day a critic upon himself, and finds something or other still to blame in his former notions and opinions. I could be glad to know if you have translated the 11th elegy of lib. ii. <HI>Ad amicam navigantem.</HI> The 8th of book iii, or the 11th of book iii, which are above all others my particular favourites, especially the last of these.</P>
<P>As to the passage of which you ask my opi∣nion in the second Aeneid, it is either so plain as to require no solution; or else (which is very probable) you see farther into it than I can. Priam would say, that <Q>“Achilles (whom sure∣ly you only feign to be your father, since your actions are so different from his) did
<PB N="118" REF="152"/>
not use me thus inhumanly. He blush'd at his murder of Hector, when he saw my sor∣rows for him; and restored his dead body to me to be buried.”</Q> To this the answer of Pyrrhus seems to be agreeable enough. <Q>“Go then to the shades, and tell Achilles how I degenerate from him:”</Q> granting the truth of what Priam had said of the difference be∣tween them. Indeed Mr. Dryden's mention∣ing here what Virgil more judiciously passes in silence, the circumstance of Achilles's selling <HI>for money</HI> the body of Hector, seems not so pro∣per; it in some measure lessening the character of Achilles's generosity and piety, which is the very point of which Priam endeavours in this place to convince his son, and to reproach him with the want of. But the truth of this cir∣cumstance is no way to be question'd, being expresly taken from Homer, who represents Achilles weeping for Priam, yet receiving the gold, Iliad xxiv. For when he gives the bo∣dy, he uses these words, <Q>“O my friend Patro∣clus! forgive me that I quit the corpse of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ransom for it, which I will bestow upon thy funeral.”</Q></P>

<P>YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement, utterly forgotten of all his friends but you; for since Mr. Wycherley left London, I have not heard a word from him; tho' just before, and once since, I writ to him, and tho' I know myself guilty of no of∣fence but of doing sincerely just what he<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Correcting his verses.

<PB N="121" REF="155"/>
me in ignorance of his welfare, which I am always very sollicitous for, and very uneasy in the fear of any indisposition that may befal him. In what I sent you some time ago, you have not verse enough to be severe upon, in re∣venge for my last criticism: In one point I must persist, that is to say, my dislike of your Paradise, in which I take no pleasure; I know very well that in Greek 'tis not only us'd by Xenophon, but is a common word for any gar∣den; but in English it bears the signification and conveys the Idea of Eden, which alone is (I think) a reason against making Ovid use it; who will be thought to talk too much like a Christian in your version at least, whatever it might have been in Latin or Greek. As for all the rest of my remarks, since you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon them (as, I think, I told you before) and in particular in the point of <HI>trees enjoying,</HI> you have, I must own, fully satisfied me that the expression is not only defensible, but beautiful. I shall be very glad to see your translation of the elegy, <HI>Ad Amicam navigan∣tem,</HI> as soon as you can; for (without a compli∣ment to you) every thing you write, either in verse or prose, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing) that I will never
<PB N="122" REF="156"/>
be unsincere, tho' I may be often mistaken. To use sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have experienced so much of it; and I need not tell you, how much I really esteem you, when I esteem no∣thing in the world so much as that quality. I know, you sometimes say civil things to me in your epistolary style, but those I am to make allowance for, as particularly when you talk of <HI>admiring;</HI> 'tis a word you are so us'd to in con∣versation of Ladies, that it will creep into your discourse, in spite of you, even to your friends. But as women, when they think themselves se∣cure of admiration, commit a thousand negli∣gences, which show them so much at disad∣vantage and off their guard, as to lose the little real love they had before: so when men ima∣gine others entertain some esteem for their abi∣lities, they often expose all their imperfections and foolish works, to the disparagement of the little wit they were thought masters of. I am going to exemplify this to you, in putting into your hands (being encouraged by so much in∣dulgence) some verses of my youth, or rather childhood; which (as I was a great admirer of Waller) were intended in imitation of his man∣ner;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">One or two of these were since printed among other Imitations done in his youth. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> and are, perhaps, such imitations, as those

But my al∣most continual illnesses prevent that, as well as most other satisfactions of my life: However, I may say one good thing of sickness, that it is the best cure in nature for ambition, and designs upon the world or fortune: It makes a man

pretty indifferent for the future, provided he can but be easy, by intervals, for the present. He will be content to compound for his quiet only, and leave all the circumstantial part and pomp of life to those, who have a health vigo∣rous enough to enjoy all the mistresses of their desires. I thank God, there is nothing out of myself which I would be at the trouble of seeking, except a friend; a happiness I once hop'd to have possess'd in Mr. Wycherley; but—<HI>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</HI>—I have for some years been employ'd much like children that build houses with cards, endeavouring very bu∣sily and eagerly to raise a friendship, which the first breath of any ill-natur'd by-stander could puff away.—But I will trouble you no farther with writing, nor myself with thinking, of this subject.</P>
<P>I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your quotation from Voiture, that you had track'd me so far as France. You see 'tis with weak heads as with weak stomachs, they immediate∣ly throw out what they received last; and what they read, floats upon the surface of the mind, like oil upon water, without incorporating. This, I think, however can't be said of the love-verses I last troubled you with, where all (I am afraid) is so puerile and so like the au∣thor, that no body will suspect any thing to be

borrow'd. Yet you (as a friend, entertaining a better opinion of them) it seems, search'd in Waller, but search'd in vain.

If you think 'em not worth the trouble of correcting, pray tell me so freely, and it will save me a labour; if you think the contrary, you would particularly oblige me by your remarks on the several thoughts as they occur.

<P>I Am glad to find by your last letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend, setting down your thoughts as they occur, and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own trifles, which, I assure you, I never valued half so much as I do that sincerity in you which they were the occasion of discovering to me; and which while I am happy in, I may be trust∣ed with that dangerous weapon, Poetry; since
<PB N="127" REF="161"/>
I shall do nothing with it but after asking and following your advice. I value sincerity the more, as I find by sad experience, the practice of it is more dangerous; writers rarely pardon∣ing the executioners of their verses, even tho' themselves pronounce sentence upon them.—As to Mr. Philips's Pastorals, I take the first to be infinitely the best, and the second the worst; the third is for the greatest part a translation from Virgil's Daphnis. I will not forestal your judgment of the rest, only observe in that of the Nightingale these lines (speaking of the musician's playing on the harp)</P>

</LG>
<P>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for pastoral, especially being put into the mouth of a shepherd, as they are here; in the poet's own person they had been (I believe) more proper. They are more af∣ter Virgil's manner than that of Theocritus, whom yet in the character of pastoral he rather seems to imitate. In the whole, I agree with the Tatler, that we have no better Eclogues in

<P>I agree with you in your censure of the use of sea-terms in Mr. Dryden's Virgil; not only because Helenus was no great prophet in those matters, but because no terms of Art or cant words suit with the majesty and dignity of style which epic poetry requires.—<HI>Cui mens divi∣nior atque os magna sonaturum.</HI>—The Tar∣pawlin phrase can please none but such <HI>qui au∣rem habent Batavam;</HI> they must not expect <HI>auribus Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phrases of Martial here very dextrously.)</P>
<P>Tho' you say you did not rightly take my meaning in the verse I quoted from Juvenal, yet I will not explain it; because, tho' it seems you are resolv'd to take me for a critic, I would by no means be thought a commentator.—And for another reason too, because I have quite forgot both the verse and the application.</P>

I hope it will be no offence to give my most hearty service to Mr. Wycherley, tho' I per∣ceive by his last to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, since he there told me he was going instantly out of town, and till his return was my servant, &amp;c. I guess by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, assure him I have ever borne all the respect and kindness imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has estranged him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more safely my friend, since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him. I could not have thought any man so very cautious and suspicious, as not to credit his own experience of a friend. Indeed to believe no body, may be a maxim of safety, but not so much of honesty. There is but one way I know of conversing safely, with all men, that is, not by concealing what we say or do, but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be conceal'd, and I can truly boast this com∣fort in my affairs with Mr. Wycherley.

<P>YOU mistake me very much in thinking the freedom you kindly us'd with my love-verses, gave me the first opinion of your sincerity: I assure you it only did what every good-natur'd action of yours has done since, confirm'd me more in that opinion. The fa∣ble of the nightingale in Philips's pastoral, is taken from Famianus Strada's Latin poem on the same subject, in his <HI>Prolusiones Academicae;</HI> only the tomb he erects at the end, is added from Virgil's conclusion of the <HI>Culex.</HI> I can't forbear giving you a passage out of the Latin poem I mention, by which you will find the English poet is indebted to it.</P>

<P>I have (as I think I formerly told you) a very good opinion of Mr. Row's ix<SUP>th</SUP> book of Lucan: Indeed he amplifies too much, as well as Breboeuf, the famous French imitator. If I remember right, he sometimes takes the whole comment into the text of the version, as par∣ticularly in lin. 808. <HI>Utque solet pariter totis se effundere signis Corycii pressura croci.</HI>—And in the place you quote, he makes of those two lines in the Latin,
<Q><L>Vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret</L>
<L>Nostra dies, risitque sui ludibria trunci,</L></Q>
no less than eight in English.</P>
<P>What you observe, sure, cannot be an Error-Sphaericus, strictly speaking, either Ptolemaic, or our Copernican system; Tycho Brahe him∣self will be on the translator's side. For Mr.
<PB N="133" REF="167"/>
Row here says no more, than that he look'd down on the rays of the sun, which Pompey might do, even tho' the body of the sun were above him.</P>
<P>You can't but have remarked what a jour∣ney Lucan here makes Cato take for the sake of his fine descriptions. From Cyrene he tra∣vels by land, for no better reason than this;
<Q><L>Haec eadem suadebat hiems, quae clauserat aequor.</L></Q>
The winter's effects on the sea, it seems, were more to be dreaded than all the serpents, whirl∣winds, sands, &amp;c. by land, which immediately after he paints out in his speech to the soldiers: Then he fetches a compass a vast way round about, to the Nasamones and Jupiter Ammon's temple, purely to ridicule the oracles: and La∣bienus must pardon me, if I do not believe him when he says—<HI>sors obtulit, &amp; fortuna viae</HI>—ei∣ther Labienus or the map, is very much mis∣taken here. Thence he returns back to the Syrtes (which he might have taken first in his way to Utica) and so to Leptis Minor, where our author leaves him; who seems to have made Cato speak his own mind, when he tells his army—<HI>Ire sat est</HI>—no matter whither.</P>

<P>THE system of Tycho Brahe (were it true, as it is novel) could have no room here: Lucan with the rest of the Latin poets, seems to follow Plato; whose order of the spheres is clear in Cicero, <HI>De natura Deorum, De somnio Scipionis,</HI> and in Macrobius, The seat of the <HI>Semidei manes</HI> is Platonic too, for <HI>Apuleius De deo Socratis</HI> assigns the same to the Genii, viz. the region of the Air for their intercourse with gods and men; so that, I fancy, Rowe mistook the situation, and I can't be reconcil'd to, <HI>Look down on the sun's rays.</HI> I am glad you a∣gree with me about the latitude he takes; and wish you had told me, if the <HI>sortilegi,</HI> and <HI>fa∣tidici,</HI> could license his invective against priests; but, I suppose, you think them (with Helena) undeserving of your protection. I agree with you in Lucan's errors, and the cause of them, his poetic descriptions: for the Romans then knew the coast of Africa from Cyrene (to the south∣east of which lies Ammon toward Egypt) to Leptis and Utica: but, pray, remember how your Homer nodded while Ulysses slept, and

<P>TO make use of that freedom and familia∣rity of style, which we have taken up in our correspondence, and which is more pro∣perly talking upon paper, than writing; I will tell you without any preface, that I never took Tycho Brahe for one of the ancients, or in the least an acquaintance of Lucan's; nay, 'tis a mercy on this occasion that I do not give you an account of his life and conversation; as how he liv'd some years like an inchanted knight in

a certain island, with a tale of a King of Den∣mark's mistress that shall be nameless—But I have compassion on you, and would not for the world you should stay any longer among the Genii and Semidei Manes, you know where; for if once you get so near the moon, Sappho will want your presence in the clouds and infe∣rior regions; not to mention the great loss Drury-lane will sustain, when Mr. <HI>C</HI>—is in the milky way. These celestial thoughts put me in mind of the priests you mention, who are a sort of Sortilegi in one sense, because in their lottery there are more blanks than prizes; the adventurers being at best in an uncertainty, whereas the setters-up are sure of something. Priests indeed in their character, as they repre∣sent God, are sacred; and so are Constables as they represent the King; but you will own a great many of them are very odd fellows, and the devil of any likeness in them. Yet I can assure you, I honour the good as much as I de∣test the bad, and I think, that in condemning these, we praise those. The translations from Ovid I have not so good an opinion of as you; because I think they have little of the main characteristic of this author, a graceful easiness. For let the sense be ever so exactly render'd, unless an author looks like himself, in his air, habit, and manner, 'tis a disguise, and not a

<P>THE same judgment we made on Rowe's ixth of Lucan will serve for his part of the vith, where I find this memorable line,
<Q><L>Parque novum Fortuna videt concurrere, bellum</L>
<L>Atque virum.</L></Q>
For this he employs six verses, among which is this,
<Q><L>As if on Knightly terms in lists they ran.</L></Q>
Pray can you trace chivalry up higher than Pha∣ramond? will you allow it an anachronism?—Tickel in his version of the Phaenix from Clau∣dian,

Claudian thus,

<P>IT seems that my late mention of Crashaw, and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curiosity. I therefore send you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of those whose works may just de∣serve reading. I take this poet to have writ like a gentleman, that is, at leisure hours, and more to keep out of idleness, than to establish a reputation: so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him. All that regards design, form, fable (which is the soul of poetry) all that concerns exactness, or consent of parts (which is the body) will probably be wanting; only pretty conceptions, fine metaphors, glit∣tering expressions, and something of a neat cast of verse (which are properly the dress, gems, or loose ornaments of poetry) may be found in these verses. This is indeed the case of most other poetical writers of miscellanies; nor can it well be otherwise, since no man can be a true poet, who writes for diversion only. These authors should be consider'd as versifiers and witty men, rather than as poets; and under
<PB N="140" REF="174"/>
this head will only fall the thoughts, the ex∣pression, and the numbers. These are only the pleasing part of poetry, which may be judged of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to express myself like a painter) their colouring entertains the sight, but the lines and life of the picture are not to be inspected too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd himself upon Petrarch, or rather upon Marino. His thoughts, one may observe, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often strain'd and stiffen'd to make them appear the greater. For men are never so apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and inconsiderate authors would rather be admir'd than understood. This ambition of surprizing a reader, is the true na∣tural cause of all fustian, or bombast in poetry. To confirm what I have said, you need but look into his first Poem of the Weeper, where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21st stanza's are as sublime∣ly dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d stanza's of the same copy, are soft and pleasing: and if these last want any thing, it is an easier and more unaffected expression. The remaining thoughts in that poem might have been spared, being either but repetitions, or ve∣ry trivial and mean. And by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest; to be
<PB N="141" REF="175"/>
like this, a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and suitable expressions, of forced and inextrica∣ble conceits, and of needless fillers-up to the rest. From all which it is plain, this author writ fast, and set down what came uppermost. A reader may skim off the froth, and use the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs; either the top or bottom of him are good for little, but what he did in his own, natural, middle-way, is best.</P>
<P>To speak of his numbers, is a little difficult, they are so various and irregular, and mostly Pindaric; 'tis evident his heroic verse (the best example of which is his Music's Duel) is care∣lesly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is, that, had he taken more care, it had been musical and pleasing enough, not extreme∣ly majestic, but sweet: and the time consider'd of his writing, he was (even as uncorrect as he is) none of the worst versificators.</P>
<P>I will just observe, that the best pieces of this author are, a Paraphrase on Psal. xxiii. On Les∣sius, Epitaph on Mr. Ashton, Wishes to his sup∣pos'd mistress, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

<P>I Resume my old liberty of throwing out my∣self upon paper to you, and making what thoughts float uppermost in my head, the sub∣ject of a letter. They are at present upon laughter, which (for aught I know) may be the cause you might sometimes think me too remiss a friend, when I was most intirely so: for I am never so inclin'd to mirth as when I am most pleas'd and most easy, which is in the company of a friend like yourself.</P>
<P>As the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disrespect, so is raillery with a friend. I know there are prudes in friendship, who expect distance, awe, and ado∣ration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol-worshipper, tho' a Pa∣pist. If I were to address Jupiter himself in a heathen way, I fancy I should be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like Dionysius; I was just going to say, of his buttons; but I think Jupiter wore none (however I won't be positive to so nice a critic as you, but his robe might be subnected with a Fibula.) I know some philosophers define laughter, <HI>A recommending ourselves to our</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="177"/>
<HI>own favour, by comparison with the weakness of another:</HI> but I am sure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe children have any such consideration in their heads, when they express their pleasure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the most part, and as sillily. There is a difference too betwixt laugh∣ing <HI>about</HI> a thing and laughing <HI>at</HI> a thing: one may find the inferior man (to make a kind of casuistical distinction) provoked to folly at the sight or observation of some <HI>circumstance of a thing,</HI> when the <HI>thing itself</HI> appears solemn and august to the superior man, that is, our judg∣ment and reason. Let an Ambassador speak the best sense in the world, and deport himself in the most graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the tail of his shirt happen (as I have known it happen to a very wise man) to hang out behind, more people shall laugh at that than at∣tend to the other; 'till they recollect themselves, and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the minister. I must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you; several muscles of my face sometimes take an impertinent li∣berty with my judgment, but then my judg∣ment soon rises, and sets all right again about my mouth: and I find I value no man so much, as him in whose sight I have been playing the fool. I cannot be <HI>sub persona</HI> before a man I
<PB N="144" REF="178"/>
love; and not to laugh with honesty, when na∣ture prompts, or folly (which is more a second nature than any thing I know) is but a knavish hypocritical way of making a mask of one's own face.—To conclude, those that are my friends I <HI>laugh with,</HI> and those that are not I <HI>laugh at;</HI> so am merry in company, and if ever I am wise, it is all by myself. You take just another course, and to those that are not your friends, are very civil; and to those that are, very endearing and complaisant: thus when you and I meet, there will be the <HI>Risus &amp; Blanditiae</HI> united together in conversation, as they com∣monly are in a verse.

The news you tell me of the many difficulties you found in your return from Bath, gives me such a kind of pleasure as we usually take in accom∣panying our friends in their mix'd adventures; for, methinks, I see you labouring thro' all your inconveniencies of the rough roads, the hard saddle, the trotting horse, and what not? What an agreeable surprize would it have been to me,
<PB N="147" REF="181"/>
to have met you by pure accident, (which I was within an ace of doing) and to have carried you off triumphantly, set you on an easier pad, and relieved the wandring knight with a night's lodg∣ing and rural repast, at our castle in the forest? But these are only the pleasing imaginations of a disappointed lover, who must suffer in a me∣lancholy absence yet these two months. In the mean time, I take up with the Muses for want of your better company; the Muses, <HI>quae nobis∣cum pernoctant, peregrinantur, rusticantur.</HI> Those aërial ladies just discover enough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit, and draw me on in a wandering maze of thought, still in hopes (and only in hopes) of attaining those favours from them, which they confer on their more happy admirers. We grasp some more beauti∣ful idea in our own brain, than our endeavours to express it can set to the view of others; and still do but labour to fall short of our first ima∣gination. The gay colouring which fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it, goes off in the execution: like those various figures in the gilded clouds, which while we gaze long upon, to separate the parts of each imaginary image, the whole faints before the eye, and de∣cays into confusion.</P>
<P>I am highly pleased with the knowledge you give me of Mr. Wycherley's present temper,

I shall ever have such a fund of affection for him as to be agreeable to myself when I am so to him, and cannot but be gay when he is in good humour, as the surface of the earth (if you will pardon a poetical similitude) is clearer or gloomier, just as the sun is brighter or more over-cast—I should be glad to see the verses to Lintot which you mention, for, methinks, something oddly agreeable may be produced from that subject—For what remains, I am so well, that nothing but the assurance of your being so can make me better; and if you would have me live with any satisfaction these dark days in which I cannot see you, it must be by your writing sometimes to</P>

Oh happy fa∣vourite of the Muses! how <HI>pernoctare,</HI> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but skirmish with them, and decline a close en∣gagement.

Think on the dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater poetry, as Dennis says, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Criticism.

<P>IF I have not writ to you so soon as I ought, let my writing now atone for the delay; as it will infallibly do, when you know what a sa∣crifice I make you at this time, and that every moment my eyes are employ'd upon this pa∣per, they are taken off from two of the finest faces in the universe. But indeed 'tis some con∣solation to me to reflect, that while I but write this period, I escape some hundred fatal darts from those unerring eyes, and about a thou∣sand deaths or better. Now you, that delight in dying, would not once have dreamt of an absent friend in these circumstances; you that are so nice an admirer of beauty, or (as a Critic would say after Terence) <HI>so elegant a spectator of forms;</HI> you must have a sober dish of coffee, and a solitary candle at your side, to write an epistle lucubratory to your friend; whereas I can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights, that outshine the golden god of day and silver goddess of night, and all the refulgent eyes of
<PB REF="185" MS="y"/>
the firmament.—You fancy now that Sappho's eyes are two of these my tapers, but it is no such matter; these are eyes that have more per∣suasion in one glance than all Sappho's oratory and gesture together, let her put her body into what moving postures she pleases. Indeed, in∣deed, my friend, you could never have found so improper a time to tempt me with interest or ambition: let me but have the reputation of these in my keeping, and as for my own, let the devil, or let Dennis, take it for ever. How gladly would I give all I am worth, that is to say, my Pastorals, for one of them, and my Es∣say for the other? I would lay out all my Poe∣try in Love; an Original for a Lady, and a Trans∣lation for a Waiting-maid! Alas! what have I to do with Jane Gray, as long as Miss Molly, Miss Betty, or Miss Patty are in this world? Shall I write of beauties murdered long ago, when there are those at this instant that murder me? I'll e'en compose my own Tragedy, and the poet shall appear in his own person to move compassion: 'Twill be far more effectual than Bays's entring with a rope about his neck, and the world will own, there never was a more miserable object brought upon the stage.</P>
<P>Now you that are a critic, pray inform me, in what manner I may connect the foregoing part of this letter with that which is to follow,

I would willingly return Mr. Gay my thanks for the favour of his poem, and in particular for his kind mention of me; I hoped, when I heard a new Comedy had met with success upon the stage, that it had been his, to which I really wish no less; and (had it been any way in my power) should have been very glad to have contributed to its introduc∣tion into the world.

<P>I Send you the book of rudiments of Draw∣ing, which you were pleas'd to command, and think myself obliged to inform you at the same time of one of the many excellencies you possess without knowing of them. You are but too good a Painter already; and no picture of Raphael's was ever so beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my acquaintance. Indeed it was but just that the finest lines in nature should be drawn upon the
<PB REF="188" MS="y"/>
most durable ground, and none could ever be met with, that would so readily receive, or so faithfully retain them, as this Heart. I may boldly say of it, that you will not find its fel∣low in all the parts of the body in this book. But I must complain to you of my hand, which is an arrant traitor to my heart; for having been copying your picture from thence and from Kneller these three days, it has done all possi∣ble injury to the finest face that ever was made, and to the liveliest image that ever was drawn. I have Imagination enough in your absence, to trace some resemblance of you; but I have been so long us'd to lose my Judgment at the sight of you, that 'tis past my power to correct it by the life. Your picture seems least like when placed before your eyes; and, contrary to all other pictures, receives a manifest disadvan∣tage by being set in the fairest light in the world. The Painters are a very vain generation, and have a long time pretended to rival nature; but to own the truth to you, she made such a finish'd piece about three and twenty years ago (I beg your pardon, Madam; I protest, I meant but two and twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any long∣er to contend with her. I know you indeed made one something like it, betwixt five and six years past: 'Twas a little girl, done with abundance of spirit and life, and wants nothing

but time to be an admirable piece: but, not to flatter your work, I don't think 'twill ever come up to what your father made. However I would not discourage you; 'tis certain you have a strange happiness, in making fine things of a sudden and at a stroke, with incredible ease and pleasure.</P>

<P>IT is too much a rule in this town, that when a lady has once done a man a favour, he is to be rude to her ever after. It becomes our sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allow us; by this method I may write to you most impudently, because you once answer'd me modestly; and if you should never do me that honour for the future, I am to think (like a true coxcomb) that your silence gives consent. Perhaps you wonder why this is address'd to you rather than to Mrs. M—, with whom I have the right of an old acquaintance, whereas you are a fine lady, have bright eyes, &amp;c. First, Madam, I make choice of you rather than of your mother, because you are younger than your mother. Secondly, because I fancy you spell better, as having been at school later. Thirdly, because you have nothing to do but
<PB N="156" REF="190"/>
to write if you please, and possibly it may keep you from employing yourself worse: it may save some honest neighbouring gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances. Cast your eyes upon paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: men are seducing, books are dangerous, the amorous ones soften you, and the godly ones give you the spleen: If you look upon trees, they clasp in embraces; birds and beasts make love; the sun is too warm for your blood; the moon melts you into yielding and melancholy. Therefore I say once more, cast your eyes upon paper, and read only such letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from innocence of soul, and simplicity of heart. Thank God I am an hundred miles off from those eyes! I would sooner trust your hand than them for doing me mischief; and tho' I doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen, yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepar'd, since I may have time while I break open your letter to cross myself and say a Pater-noster, I hope Provi∣dence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance. I am told you are at this hour as handsome as an angel; for my part I have forgot your face since two winters. You may be grown to a giantess for all I know. I can't

tell in any respect what sort of creature you are, only that you are a very mischievous one, whom I shall ever pray to be defended from. But when your Minister sends me word you have the small-pox, a good many freckles, or are very pale, I will desire him to give thanks for it in your parish church; which as soon as he shall inform me he has done, I will make you a visit without armour: I will eat any thing you give me without suspicion of poison, take you by the hand without gloves, nay venture to follow you into an arbour without calling the company. This, Madam, is the top of my wishes, but how differently are our desires in∣clined! You sigh out, in the ardour of your heart, Oh play-houses, parks, opera's, assem∣blies, London!

<P>Written on one column of a Letter, while Lady M. wrote to the Lady's Husband on the other.</P>
<P>THE wits would say, that this must needs be a dull letter because it is a married one. I am afraid indeed you will find, what spirit
<PB REF="192" MS="y"/>
there is, must be on the side of the wife, and the husband's part, as usual, will prove the dullest. What an unequal pair are put toge∣ther in this sheet? in which, tho' we sin, it is you must do penance. When you look on both sides of this paper, you may fancy that our words (according to a Scripture expression) are as a two-edg'd sword, whereof lady M. is the shining blade, and I only the handle. But I can't proceed without so far mortifying Sir Ro∣bert as to tell him, that she writes this purely in obedience to me, and that it is but one of those honours a husband receives for the sake of his wife.</P>
<P>It is making court but ill to one fine woman to shew her the regard we have for another; and yet I must own there is not a period of this epistle but squints towards another over∣against it. It will be in vain to dissemble: your penetrating eyes cannot but discover, how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after lady M's. letters, which seem to bend as much from mine, and fly from them as fast as they are able. Ungrateful letters that they are! which give themselves to another man, in the very presence of him who will yield to no mortal, in knowing how to value them.</P>
<P>You will think I forget myself, and am not writing to you; but, let me tell you, 'tis you

Besides, can you imagine a man of my importance so stupid, as to say fine things to you before your husband? Let us see how far Lady M. herself dares do any thing like it, with all the wit and address she is mistress of. If Sir Robert can be so ig∣norant (now he is left to himself in the coun∣try) to imagine any such matter, let him know from me, that here in town every thing that lady says, is taken for satire.

<P>YOU have put me into so much gayety of temper, that there will not be a serious word in this day's letter. No more, you'll say, there would, if I told you the whole serious business of the town. All last night I conti∣nued with you, tho' your unreasonable regulari∣ty drove me out of your doors at three a clock. I dreamed all over the evening's conversation, and saw the little bed in spite of you. In the
<PB N="160" REF="194"/>
morning I waked, very angry at your phantom for leaving me so abruptly.—I know you de∣light in my mortification. I dined with an old Beauty; she appear'd at the table like a Death's head enamell'd. The Egyptians, you know, had such things at their entertainments; but do you think they painted and patched them? However, the last of these objections was soon remov'd; for the lady had so violent an appe∣tite for a salmon, that she quickly eat all the patches off her face. She divided the fish into three parts; not equal, God knows; for she helped Gay to the head, me to the middle, and making the rest much the largest part took it herself, and cried very naively, I'll be content with my own tail.</P>
<P>My supper was as singular as my dinner. It was with a great Poet and Ode-maker (that is, a great poet out of his wits, or out of his way.) He came to me very hungry; not for want of a dinner (for that I should make no jest of) but, having forgot to dine. He fell most furi∣ously on the broil'd relics of a shoulder of mut∣ton, commonly call'd a blade-bone: he pro∣fessed he never tasted so exquisite a thing! beg∣ged me to tell him what joint it was; wondered he had never heard the name of this joint, or seen it at other tables; and desir'd to know how he might direct his butcher to cut out the same
<PB N="161" REF="195"/>
for the future? And yet this man, so ignorant in modern butchery, has cut up half an hundred heroes, and quartered five or six miserable lovers in every tragedy he has written. I have nothing more to tell you to day.</P>

<P>YOU should have my Day too, Sir, but in∣deed I slept it out, and so I'll give you all that was left, my last Night's entertainment. You know the company. I went in late, in order to be better received; but unluckily came in, as Deuce-ace was flinging (Lord H. would say I came in the Nick.) The Lady colour'd, and the men took the name of the Lord in vain: No body spoke to me, and I sat down disappointed; then affecting a careless air, gap'd, and cried seven or eight times, <HI>D'ye win or lose?</HI> I could safely say at that moment I had no temptation to any one of the seven, lively sins; and in the innocent way I was, happy had it been for me if I had died! Moralizing sat I by the hazard-table; I looked upon the uncertain∣ty of riches, the decay of beauty, and the crash of worlds with as much contempt as ever
<PB N="162" REF="196"/>
Plato did. But ah! the frailty of human na∣ture! some ridiculous thought came into my head, wakened my passions, which burst forth into a violent laughter: I rose from my seat, and not considering the just resentments of the losing gamesters, hurl'd a ball of paper cross the table, which stop'd the dice, and turn'd up seven instead of five. Curs'd on all sides, and not knowing where to fly, I threw myself into a chair, which I demolish'd and never spoke a word after. We went to supper, and a lady said, <HI>Miss G. looks prodigiously like a Tree.</HI> Every body agreed to it, and I had not curiosi∣ty to ask the meaning of that sprightly fancy: Find it out, and let me know.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Bath, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are to understand, Madam, that my passion for your fair self and your sister, has been divided with the most wonderful re∣gularity in the world. Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to Bath fell out in the three hundred seventy-sixth week of the reign of my sovereign lady Sylvia. At the present writing hereof it is the three hun∣dred eighty-ninth week of the reign of your most serene majesty, in whose service I was listed some weeks before I beheld your sister. This Information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either shall hap∣pen to be Queen-regent at that time.</P>
<P>Pray tell your sister, all the good qualities and virtuous inclinations she has, never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation, as that one vice of her obstinacy will give me mortification this month. Ratcliffe commands her to the Bath, and she refuses! indeed if I were in Berkshire I should honour her for this obstinacy, and magnify her no less for disobe∣dience than we do the Barcelonians. But peo∣ple change with the change of places (as we
<PB N="165" REF="199"/>
see of late) and virtues become vices when they cease to be for one's interest, with me, as with others.</P>
<P>Yet let me tell her, she will never look so finely while she is upon earth, as she would here in the water. It is not here as in most other instances, for those ladies that would please extremely, must go out of their own element. She does not make half so good a figure on horseback as Christina Queen of Swe∣den; but were she once seen in the Bath, no man would part with her for the best meirmaid in Christendom. You know I have seen you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white, I have experienced the utmost you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful steps, deserve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and easy behaviour in buckram: Something be∣tween swimming and walking, free enough, and more modestly-half-naked than you can appear any where else. You have conquer'd enough already by land; show your ambition, and vanquish also by water. The buckram I mention is a dress particularly useful at this time, when, we are told, they are bringing over the fashion of German ruffs: You ought to use yourselves to some degrees of stiffness be∣forehand; and when our ladies chins have been
<PB N="166" REF="200"/>
tickled a-while with starched muslin and wire, they may possibly bear the brush of a German beard and whisker.</P>
<P>I could tell you a delightful story of Doctor P. but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances. He had heard it was an excel∣lent cure for love, to kiss the Aunt of the per∣son beloved, who is generally of years and ex∣perience enough to damp the fiercest flame: he try'd this course in his passion, and kissed Mrs. E—at Mr. D—'s, but, he says, it will not do, and that he loves you as much as ever.</P>

<P>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I must tell you, so very well, that I question how you and I should agree if we were in a room by ourselves. Mrs.—has honestly as∣sured me, that but for some whims which she can't entirely conquer, she would go and see the world with me in man's cloaths. Even you, Madam, I fancy (if you would not partake in our adventures) would wait our coming in at
<PB N="167" REF="201"/>
the evening with some impatience, and be well enough pleas'd to hear them by the fire-side. That would be better than reading romances, unless lady M. would be our historian. What raises these desires in me, is an acquaintance I am beginning with my lady Sandwich, who has all the spirit of the last age, and all the gay ex∣perience of a pleasurable life. It were as scan∣dalous an omission to come to the Bath and not to see my lady Sandwich, as it had formerly been to have travelled to Rome without visiting the Queen of Sweden. She is, in a word, the best thing this country has to boast of; and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be, so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be.</P>
<P>I must tell you a truth, which is not, however, much to my credit. I never thought so much of yourself and your sister, as since I have been fourscore miles distance from you. In the Fo∣rest I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at London as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, goddesses, or what you will. In the same manner I never knew at what rate I valued your life, till you were upon the point of dying. If Mrs.—and you will but fall very sick every season, I shall certainly die for you. Seriously I value you both so much, that I esteem others much the less for your sakes;
<PB N="168" REF="202"/>
you have robb'd me of the pleasure of esteem∣ing a thousand pretty qualities in them, by showing me so many finer in yourselves. There are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me, which, I believe, you are not capable of, I mean ill-nature and malice. I have seen enough of you, not to overlook any frailty you could have, and no∣thing less than a vice can make me like you less. I expect you should discover by my con∣duct towards you both, that this is true, and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one disposition.

<P>I Return'd home as slow and as contemplative after I had parted from you, as my Lord* retired from the Court and glory to his Country seat and wife, a week ago. I found here a dis∣mal desponding letter from the son of another great courtier who expects the same fate, and
<PB N="169" REF="203"/>
who tells me the great ones of the earth will now take it very kindly of the mean ones, if they will favour them with a visit by day-light. With what joy would they lay down all their schemes of glory, did they but know you have the generosity to drink their healths once a day, as soon as they are fallen? Thus the unhappy, by the sole merit of their misfortunes, become the care of Heaven and you. I intended to have put this last into verse, but in this age of ingratitude my best friends forsake me, I mean my rhymes.</P>
<P>I desire Mrs. P—to stay her stomach with these half hundred Plays, till I can procure her a Romance big enough to satisfy her great soul with adventures. As for Novels, I fear she can depend upon none from me but that of my Life, which I am still, as I have been, contriv∣ing all possible methods to shorten, for the greater ease both of the historian and the reader. May she believe all the passion and tenderness express'd in these Romances to be but a faint image of what I bear her, and may you (who read nothing) take the same truth upon hear∣ing it from me. You will both injure me very much, if you don't think me a truer friend, than ever any romantic lover, or any imitator of their style could be.</P>

<P>THE more I examine my own mind, the more romantic I find myself. Methinks it is a noble spirit of contradiction to Fate and Fortune, not to give up those that are snatched from us; but to follow them the more, the farther they are remov'd from the sense of it. Sure, Flattery never travelled so far as three thousand miles; it is now only for Truth, which overtakes all things, to reach you at this di∣stance. 'Tis a generous piece of Popery, that pursues even those who are to be eternally ab∣sent, into another world; whether you think it right or wrong, you'll own the very extrava∣gance a sort of piety. I can't be satisfied with strowing flowers over you, and barely honour∣ing you as a thing lost: but must consider you as a glorious tho' remote being, and be sending
<PB N="171" REF="205"/>
addresses after you. You have carried away so much of me, that what remains is daily lan∣guishing and dying over my acquaintance here, and, I believe, in three or four months more I shall think <HI>Aurat Bazar</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At Constantinople.</NOTE> as good a place as <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> You may imagine this is rail∣lery, but I am really so far gone as to take plea∣sure in reveries of this kind. Let them say I am romantic, so is every one said to be, that either admires a fine thing or does one. On my conscience, as the world goes, 'tis hardly worth any body's while to do one for the honour of it: Glory, the only pay of generous actions, is now as ill paid as other just debts; and neither Mrs. Macfarland for immolating her lover, not you, for constancy to your lord, must ever hope to be compared to Lucretia or Portia.</P>
<P>I write this in some anger; for having, since you went, frequented those people most, who seemed most in your favour, I heard nothing that concerned you talked of so often, as that you went away in a black full-bottom'd wig; which I did but assert to be a bob, and was answered, <HI>Love is blind.</HI> I am persuaded your wig had never suffered this criticism, but on the score of your head, and the two eyes that are in it.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="206"/>
Pray when you write to me, talk of yourself; there is nothing I so much desire to hear of: talk a great deal of yourself; that she who I al∣ways thought talked best, may speak upon the best subject. The shrines and reliques you tell me of, no way engage my curiosity; I had ten times rather go on pilgrimage to see one such face as yours, than both St. John Baptist's heads. I wish (since you are grown so covetous of golden things) you had not only all the fine statues you talk of, but even the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar set up, provided you were to travel no farther than you could carry it.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna is very edifying. The ladies, with respect to their husbands, seem to understand that text literally, that commands to <HI>hear one another's burthens:</HI> but, I fancy, many a man there is like <HI>Issachar,</HI> an <HI>ass</HI> between <HI>two burthens.</HI> I shall look upon you no more as a Christian, when you pass from that charitable court to the land of jealousy. I expect to hear an exact account how, and at what places, you leave one of the thirty-nine articles after another, as you approach to the lands of infidelity. Pray how far are you got already? amidst the pomp of a high mass, and the ravishing trills of a Sunday opera, what did you think of the doc∣trine and discipline of the church of England? had you from your heart a reverence for Stern∣hold
<PB N="173" REF="207"/>
and Hopkins? How did your Christian virtues hold out in so long a voyage? you have, it seems (without passing the bounds of Christ∣endom) out-travelled the sin of fornication: in a little time you'll look upon some others with more patience, than the ladies here are capable of. I reckon, you'll time it so well as to make your religion last to the verge of Christendom, that you may discharge your Chaplain (as hu∣manity requires) in a place where he may find some business.</P>
<P>I doubt not but I shall be told (when I come to follow you through those countries) in how pretty a manner you accommodated yourself to the customs of the true Muslemen. They will tell me at what town you practised to sit on the Sopha, at what village you learned to fold a Turbant, where you was bathed and anointed, and where you parted with your black full-bot∣tom. How happy must it be for a gay young woman, to live in a country where it is a part of religious worship to be <HI>giddy-headed?</HI> I shall hear at Belgrade how the good Bashaw received you with tears of joy, how he was charmed with your agreeable manner of pronouncing the words <HI>Allah</HI> and <HI>Muhamed;</HI> and how earn∣estly you joined with him in exhorting your friend to embrace that religion. But I think his objection was a just one, that it was attended
<PB N="174" REF="208"/>
with some circumstances under which he could not properly represent his Britannic Majesty.</P>
<P>Lastly, I shall hear how, the first night you lay at Pera, you had a vision of Mahomet's Paradise; and happily awaked without a soul, from which blessed moment the beautiful body was left at full liberty to perform all the agree∣able functions it was made for.</P>
<P>I see I have done in this letter as I often have done in your company, talk'd myself into a good humour, when I begun in an ill one; the pleasure of addressing to you makes me run on, and 'tis in your own power to shorten this letter as much as you please, by giving over when you please; so I'll make it no longer by apologies.</P>

<P>YOU have asked me news a hundred times at the first word you spoke to me, which some would interpret as if you expected nothing better from my lips: and truly 'tis not a sign two lovers are together, when they can be so impertinent as to enquire what the world does? All I mean by this is, that either you or I are not in love with the other: I leave you to guess which of the two is that stupid and insensible
<PB N="175" REF="209"/>
creature, so blind to the other's excellencies and charms?</P>
<P>This then shall be a letter of News; and sure, if you did not think me the humblest creature in the world, you could never imagine a Poet could dwindle to a brother of Dawks and Dyer, from a rival of Tate and Brady.</P>
<P>The Earl of Oxford has behaved so bravely, that in this act at least he might seem above man, if he had not just now voided a stone to prove him subject to human infirmities. The utmost weight of affliction from ministerial power and popular hatred, were almost worth bearing, for the glory of such a dauntless con∣duct as he has shewn under it.</P>
<P>You may soon have your wish, to enjoy the gallant sights of armies, incampments, stand∣ards waving over your brother's corn-fields, and the pretty windings of the Thames stained with the blood of men. Your barbarity, which I have heard so long exclaim'd against in town and country, may have its fill of destruction. I would not add one circumstance usual in all de∣scriptions of calamity, that of the many rapes committed, or to be committed upon those unfortunate women that <HI>delight in war.</HI> But God forgive me—in this martial age, if I could, I would buy a regiment for your sake and Mrs.
<PB N="176" REF="210"/>
P—'s and some others, whom, I have cause to fear, no fair means will prevail upon.</P>
<P>Those eyes, that care not how much mischief is done, or how great slaughter committed, so they have but a fine show; those very female eyes, will be infinitely delighted with the camp which is speedily to be formed in Hyde-park. The tents are carried thither this morning, new regiments with new cloaths and furniture (far exceeding the late cloth and linen designed by his Grace for the soldiery.) The sight of so many gallant fellows, with all the pomp and glare of war yet undeform'd by battles, those scenes which England has for many years only beheld on stages, may possibly invite your cu∣riosity to this place.</P>
<P>By our latest account from Dukestreet, West∣minster, the conversion of T. G. Esq. is re∣ported in a manner somewhat more particular. That upon the seizure of his Flanders mares, he seem'd more than ordinarily disturbed for some hours, sent for his ghostly father, and re∣solved to bear his loss like a Christian; till about the hours of seven or eight the coaches and horses of several of the Nobility passing by his window towards Hyde-park, he could no longer endure the disappointment, but instantly went out, took the oath of Abjuration, and re∣cover'd his dear horses, which carry'd him in

<P>THE weather is too fine for any one that loves the country to leave it at this sea∣son; when every smile of the sun, like the smile of a coy lady, is as dear as it is uncom∣mon: and I am so much in the taste of rural pleasures, I had rather see the sun than any thing he can shew me, except yourself. I de∣spise every fine thing in town, not excepting your new gown, till I see you dress'd in it, (which by the way I don't like the better for the red; the leaves, I think, are very pretty.) I am growing fit, I hope, for a better world, of which the light of the sun is but a shadow: for I doubt not but God's works here, are what come nearest to his works there; and that a true relish of the beauties of nature is the most easy preparation and gentlest transition to an enjoyment of those of heaven: as on the con∣trary, a true town-life of hurry, confusion,
<PB N="178" REF="212"/>
noise, slander, and dissension, is a sort of ap∣prenticeship to hell and its furies. I'm endea∣vouring to put my mind into as quiet a situa∣tion as I can, to be ready to receive that stroke which, I believe, is coming upon me, and have fully resign'd myself to yield to it. The sepa∣ration of my soul and body is what I could think of with less pain; for I am very sure he that made it will take care of it, and in what∣ever state he pleases it shall be, that state must be right: But I cannot think without tears of being separated from my friends, when their condition is so doubtful, that they may want even such assistance as mine. Sure, it is more merciful to take from us after death all memory of what we lov'd or pursued here: for else what a torment would it be to a spirit, still to love those creatures it is quite divided from? Unless we suppose, that in a more exalted life, all that we esteemed in this imperfect state will affect us no more, than what we lov'd in our infancy concerns us now.</P>
<P>This is an odd way of writing to a lady, and, I'm sensible, would throw me under a great deal of ridicule, were you to show this letter among your acquaintance. But perhaps you may not yourself be quite a stranger to this way of thinking. I heartily wish your life may be so long and so happy, as never to let you think
<PB N="179" REF="213"/>
<HI>quite so far</HI> as I am now led to do; but, to think <HI>a little towards it,</HI> is what will make you the happier, and the easier at all times.</P>
<P>There are no pleasures or amusements that I don't wish you, and therefore 'tis no small grief to me that I shall for the future be less able to partake with you in them. But let for∣tune do her worst, whatever she makes us lose, as long as she never makes us lose our honesty and our independance; I despise from my heart whoever parts with the first, and I pity from my soul whoever quits the latter.</P>
<P>I am grieved at Mr. G—'s condition in this last respect of dependance. He has Merit, Good-nature, and Integrity, three qualities, that I fear are too often lost upon great men; or at least are not all three a match for that one which is oppos'd to them, Flattery. I wish it may not soon or late displace him from the fa∣vour he now possesses, and seems to like. I'm sure his late action deserves eternal favour and esteem: Lord Bathurst was charm'd with it, who came hither to see me before his journey. He ask'd and spoke very particularly of you. To-morrow Mr. Fortescue comes to me from London about B—'s suit in <HI>forma pauperis.</HI> That poor man looks starved: he tells me you have been charitable to him.

<P>THIS is a day of wishes for you, and I hope you have long known, there is not one good one which I do not form in your be∣half. Every year that passes, I wish some things more for my friends, and some things less for myself. Yet were I to tell you what I wish for you in particular, it would be only to repeat in prose, what I told you last year in rhyme (so sincere is my poetry:) I can only add, that as I then wish'd you a friend <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">To Mrs.—on her Birth-day.
<Q><L>"O be thou blest with all that heav'n can send,</L>
<L>"Long health, long life, long pleasure, and a <HI>friend."</HI></L></Q></NOTE>, I now wish that friend were Mrs.—</P>
<P>Absence is a short kind of death; and in ei∣ther, one can only wish, that the friends we are separated from, may be happy with those that are left them. I am therefore very solli∣citous that you may pass much agreeable time together: I am sorry to say I envy you no other companion; tho' I hope you have o∣thers that you like; and I am always pleas'd in that hope, when it is not attended with any fears on your own account.</P>

I was troubled to leave you both, just as I fancy'd we should begin to live together in the country. 'Twas a little like dying the mo∣ment one had got all one desir'd in this world. Yet I go away with one generous sort of satis∣faction, that what I part with, you are to in∣herit.</P>
<P>I know you would both be pleas'd to hear some certain news of a friend departed; to have the adventures of his passage, and the new re∣gions thro' which he travell'd, described; and, upon the whole, to know, that he is as happy where he now is, as while he liv'd among you. But indeed I (like many a poor unprepar'd soul) have seen nothing I like so well as what I left: No scenes of Paradise, no happy bowers, equal to those on the banks of the Thames. Where∣ever I wander, one reflection strikes me: I wish you were as free as I; or at least had a tye as tender, and as reasonable as mine, to a relation that as well deserved your constant thought, and to whom you would be always pull'd back (in such a manner as I am) by the heart-string. I have never been well since I set out: but don't tell my mother so; it will trouble her too much: And as probably the same reason may prevent her sending a true account of her health to me, I must desire you to acquaint me. I would gladly hear the country air improves

<P>YOU can't be surpriz'd to find him a dull correspondent whom you have known so long for a dull companion. And tho' I am pretty sensible, that, if I have any wit, I may as well write to show it, as not; yet I'll con∣tent myself with giving you as plain a history of my pilgrimage, as Purchas himself, or as John Bunyan could do of his <HI>walking through the wild∣erness of this world,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>First then I went by water to Hampton-Court, unattended by all but my own virtues; which were not of so modest a nature as to keep themselves, or me, conceal'd: For I met the Prince with all his ladies on horseback, coming from hunting. Mrs. B* and Mrs. L* took me into protection (contrary to the laws against harbouring Papists) and gave me a dinner, with something I liked better, an opportunity of con∣versation with Mrs. H*. We all agreed that the life of a Maid of honour was of all things
<PB N="183" REF="217"/>
the most miserable: and wish'd that every wo∣man who envy'd it, had a specimen of it. To eat Westphalia-ham in a morning, ride over hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks, come home in the heat of the day with a fever, and (what is worse a hundred times) with a red mark in the forehead from an uneasy hat; all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for fox-hunters, and bear abundance of ruddy complexion'd children. As soon as they can wipe off the sweat of the day, they must sim∣per an hour and catch cold, in the Princess's apartment: from thence (as Shakespear has it) to <HI>dinner, with what appetite they may</HI>—and af∣ter that, till midnight, walk, work, or think, which they please. I can easily believe, no lone∣house in Wales, with a mountain and a rookery, is more contemplative than this Court; and as a proof of it I need only tell you, Mrs. L* walk'd with me three or four hours by moonlight, and we met no creature of any quality but the King, who gave audience to the vice-chamber∣lain, all alone, under the garden-wall.</P>
<P>In short, I heard of no ball, assembly, bas∣set-table, or any place where two or three were gathered together, except Madam Kilmansegg's, to which I had the honour to be invited, and the grace to stay away.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="218"/>
I was heartily tired, and posted to—park: there we had an excellent discourse of quackery; Dr. S* was mentioned with honour.

<P>I arrived in the forest by Tuesday noon, hav∣ing fled from the face (I wish I could say the horned face) of Moses, who dined in the mid∣way thither.

<P>NOthing could have more of that melan∣choly which once used to please me, than my last day's journey; for after having pass'd through my favourite woods in the forest, with a thousand reveries of past pleasures, I rid over hanging hills, whose tops were edged with groves, and whose feet water'd with winding rivers, listening to the falls of cataracts below, and the murmuring of the winds above: The gloomy verdure of Stonor succeeded to these; and then the shades of the evening overtook me. The moon rose in the clearest sky I ever saw, by whose solemn light I paced on slowly, without company, or any interruption to the range of my thoughts. About a mile before I reach'd Oxford, all the bells toll'd in different notes; the clocks of every college answered one another, and sounded forth (some in a deeper, some a softer tone) that it was eleven at night. All this was no ill preparation to the life I have led since, among those old walls, venerable galleries, stone portico's, studious walks, and solitary scenes of the University. I wanted nothing but a black gown and a salary, to be as mere a bookworm as any there. I conform'd myself to the college hours, was roll'd up in
<PB N="186" REF="220"/>
books, lay in one of the most ancient, dusky parts of the University, and was as dead to the world as any hermit of the desart. If any thing was alive or awake in me, it was a little va∣nity, such as even those good men us'd to en∣tertain, when the monks <HI>of their own order</HI> ex∣toll'd their piety and abstraction. For I found myself receiv'd with a sort of respect, which this idle part of mankind, the Learned, pay to their own species; who are as considerable here, as the busy, the gay, and the ambitious are in your world.</P>
<P>Indeed I was treated in such a manner, that I could not but sometimes ask myself in my mind, what college I was founder of, or what library I had built? Methinks, I do very ill to return to the world again, to leave the only place where I make a figure, and, from seeing myself seated with dignity on the most conspi∣cuous shelves of a library, put myself into the ab∣ject posture of lying at a lady's feet in St. James's square.</P>
<P>I will not deny, but that, like Alexander, in the midst of my glory I am wounded, and find myself a mere man. To tell you from whence the dart comes, is to no purpose, since neither of you will take the tender care to draw it out of my heart, and suck the poison with your lips.</P>

Here, at my Lord H—'s, I see a crea∣ture nearer an angel than a woman (tho' a woman be very near as good as an angel;) I think you have formerly heard me mention Mrs. T—as a credit to the Maker of angels; she is a relation of his lordship's, and he grave∣ly propos'd her to me for a wife; being tender of her interests, and knowing (what is a shame to Providence) that she is less indebted to for∣tune than I. I told him, 'twas what he could never have thought of, if it had not been his misfortune to be blind; and what I never could think of, while I had eyes to see both her and myself.</P>

It would be an inexpressible joy to me if I could serve you, and I will always do all I can to give myself pleasure.

<P>I Am not at all concern'd to think that this letter may be less entertaining than some I have sent: I know you are a friend that will think a kind letter as good as a diverting one. He that gives you his mirth makes a much less present than he that gives you his heart; and true friends would rather see such thoughts as they communicate only to one another, than what they squander about to all the world. They who can set a right value upon any thing, will prize one tender, well-meant word, above all that ever made them laugh in their lives. If I did not think so of you, I should never have taken much pains to endeavour to please you, by writing, or any thing else. Wit, I am sure, I want; at least in the degree that I see others have it, who would at all seasons alike be en∣tertaining; but I would willingly have some qualities that may be (at some seasons) of more comfort to myself, and of more service to my friends. I would cut off my own head, if it had nothing better than wit in it; and tear out my own heart, if it had no better dispositions than to love only myself, and laugh at all my neighbours.</P>

How many verses could I gladly have left unfinish'd, and turn'd into it, for people to say what they would of, had I been permitted to pass all those hours more pleasingly? Whatever some may think, Fame is a thing I am much less covet∣ous of, than your Friendship; for that, I hope, will last all my life; the other I cannot answer for.

<P>ALL the pleasure or use of familiar letters, is to give us the assurance of a friend's welfare; at least 'tis all I know, who am a mortal enemy and despiser of what they call fine letters. In this view, I promise you, it will always be a satisfaction to me to write letters and to receive them from you; because I un∣feignedly have your good at my heart, and am that thing, which many people make only a subject to display their fine sentiments upon, a Friend: which is a character that admits of lit∣tle to be said, till something may be done. Now let me fairly tell you, I don't like your style: 'tis very pretty, therefore I don't like it; and if you writ as well as Voiture, I would not give a farthing for such letters, unless I were to sell them to be printed. Methinks I have lost the Mrs. L* I formerly knew, who writ and talked like other people (and some∣times better.) You must allow me to say, you have not said a sensible word in all your letter, except where you speak of shewing kindness and expecting it in return: but the addition you make about your being but two and twen∣ty, is again in the style of wit and abomination. To shew you how very unsatisfactorily you

write, in all your letters you've never told me how you do. Indeed I see 'twas absolutely ne∣cessary for me to write to you, before you con∣tinued to take more notice of me, for I ought to tell you what you are to expect; that is to say, Kindness, which I never fail'd (I hope) to return; and not Wit, which if I want, I am not much concerned, because Judgment is a better thing; and if I had, I would make use of it rather to play upon those I despised, than to trifle with those I loved. You see, in short, after what manner you may most agreeably write to me: tell me you are my friend, and you can be no more at a loss about that article. As I have open'd my mind upon this to you, it may also serve for Mr. H—, who will see by it what manner of letters he must expect if he cor∣responds with me. As I am too seriously yours and his servant to put turns upon you instead of good wishes, so in return I should have nothing but honest plain How-d'ye's and Pray remem∣ber me's; which not being fit to be shown to any body for wit, may be a proof we correspond only for ourselves, in mere friendliness; as doth, God is my witness,</P>

As I have often condoled with you in your adversities, so I have a right, which but few can pretend to, of congratulating on the prospect of your better fortunes: and I hope, for the future, to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felicities. Tho' you modestly say the world has left you, yet, I veri∣ly believe, it is coming to you again as fast as it can: for, to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis past its power to oppose it. Therefore, if you can, take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it.

<P>I Can say little to recommend the letters I shall write to you, but that they will be the most impartial representations of a free heart, and the truest copies you ever saw, tho' of a very mean original. Not a feature will be softened, or any advantageous light employed to make the ugly thing a little less hideous; but

you shall find it in all respects, most horribly like. You will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing I shall say from this instant, as a com∣pliment, either to you or to myself: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to per∣severe till death, in every sentiment or notion I now set down, than you would imagine a man's face should never change when once his picture was drawn.</P>
<P>The freedom I shall use in this manner of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools, the honest ones. And since what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in spite of all our art to keep it down; methinks, 'tis almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at all, and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends. If Momus's project had taken, of having windows in our breasts, I should be for carrying it further, and making those windows, casements; that while a man showed his heart to all the world, he might do something more for his friends; even give it them, and trust it to their handling.

Not that I think every body naked altogether so fine a sight, as yourself and a few more would be, but because 'tis good to use people to what they must be acquainted with; and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other, to uncover every soul of us. We shall then see that the Prudes of this world owed all their fine figure only to their being straiter-laced than the rest; and that they are naturally as arrant squabs as those that went more loose, nay as those that never girded their loins at all.—But a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me, is, that I am confident no one knows you better; for I find, when others ex∣press their thoughts of you, they fall very short of mine, and, I know, at the same time, theirs are such as you would think sufficiently in your favour.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine how desirous I must be of a correspondence with a person, who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight, as to love: and who has since ruin'd me for all the conversation of one sex, and almost all the friendship of the other. I am but too sensible thro' your means, that the
<PB N="197" REF="231"/>
company of men wants a certain softness to re∣commend it, and that of women wants every thing else. How often have I been quietly go∣ing to take possession of that tranquillity and in∣dolence I had so long found in the Country; when one evening of your conversation has spoil'd me for a Solitaire! Books have lost their effect upon me, and I was convinced since I saw you, that there is one alive wiser than all the sages. A plague of female wisdom! it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own. What is very strange, Virtue herself (when you have the dressing her) is too amiable for one's repose. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allowed half the fine gentlemen who have seen you, to have conversed with you; they would have been strangely bit, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair lady, and you had bewitch'd them with Reason and Virtue (two beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy distance at which we corre∣spond, removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth, to save good-breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blush; we converse upon such unfortunate ge∣nerous
<PB N="198" REF="232"/>
terms, as exclude the regards of fear, shame, or design, in either of us. And, me∣thinks it would be as paltry a part, to impose (even in a single thought) upon each other in this state of separation, as for spirits of a differ∣ent sphere, who have so little intercourse with us, to employ that little (as some would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a question, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most instances of my life. In what manner did I behave in the last hour I saw you? What degree of concern did I discover when I felt a misfortune, which, I hope, you will never feel, that of parting from what one most esteems? for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever de∣cency made.</P>
<P>I never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon see∣ing the tomb of a friend, which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost. I reflect upon the circumstances of your departure, which I was there a witness of (your beha∣viour in what I may call your last moments) and I indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were given to
<PB N="199" REF="233"/>
me. I would fain imagine this was not acci∣dental, but proceeded from a penetration, which, I know, you have, in finding out the truth of people's sentiments; and that you were willing, the last man that <HI>would have</HI> parted from you, should be the last that <HI>did.</HI> I really looked upon you just as the friends of Curtius might have done upon that Hero, at the instant when he was devoting himself to glory, and running to be lost out of generosity: I was obliged to admire your resolution, in as great a degree as I deplored it; and had only to wish, that Heaven would reward so much virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could en∣joy elsewhere!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>I Can never have too many of your letters. I am angry at every scrap of paper lost, and tho' it is but an odd compliment to compare a fine lady to a Sibyl, your leaves, methinks, like hers, are too good to be committed to the winds; tho' I have no other way of receiving them but by those unfaithful messengers. I have had but three, and I reckon that short one
<PB N="200" REF="234"/>
from D—, which was rather a dying ejacu∣lation than a letter.</P>
<P>You have contrived to say in your last the two things most pleasing to me: The first, that whatever be the fate of your letters, you will continue to write in the discharge of your con∣science. The other is, the justice you do me, in taking what I writ to you, in the serious manner it was meant; it is the point upon which I can bear no suspicion, and in which, above all, I desire to be thought serious. It would be vexatious indeed, if you should pre∣tend to take that for wit, which is no more than the natural overflowing of a heart im∣proved by an esteem for you: but since you tell me you believe me, I fancy my expres∣sions have not been entirely unfaithful to my thoughts.</P>
<P>May your faith be encreased in all truths, that are as great as this; and, depend upon it, to whatever degree it may extend, you can ne∣ver be a bigot.</P>
<P>If you could see the heart I talk of, you would really think it a foolish good kind of thing, with some qualities as well-deserving to be half-laughed at, and half-esteemed, as most hearts in the world.</P>
<P>Its grand <HI>foible</HI> in regard to you, is the most like Reason of any <HI>foible</HI> in nature. Upon my
<PB N="201" REF="235"/>
word this heart is not like a great warehouse, stored only with my own goods, or with empty spaces to be supplied as fast as Interest or Am∣bition can fill them: but is every inch of it lett out into lodgings for its friends, and shall never want a corner where your idea will always lie as warm, and as close, as any idea in Christ∣endom.</P>
<P>If this distance (as you are so kind as to say) enlarges your belief of my friendship, I assure you, it has so extended my notion of your va∣lue, that I begin to be impious upon that ac∣count, and to wish that even slaughter, ruin, and desolation may interpose between you and the place you design for; and that you were restored to us at the expence of a whole people.</P>
<P>Is there no expedient to return you in peace to the bosom of your country? I hear you are come as far as—: do you only look back to die twice? is Eurydice once more snatched to the shades? If ever mortal had reason to hate the King, it is I, whose particular misfortune it is, to be almost the only innocent person he has made to suffer; both by his Government at home, and his Negotiations abroad.</P>
<P>If you must go from us, I wish at least you might pass to your banishment by the most pleasant way; that all the road might be roses
<PB N="202" REF="236"/>
and myrtles, and a thousand objects rise round you, agreeable enough to make England less desirable to you. It is not now my interest to wish England agreeable: It is highly probable it may use me ill enough to drive me from it. Can I think that place my country, where I cannot now call a foot of paternal <HI>Earth</HI> my own? Yet it may seem some alleviation, that when the wisest thing I can do is to leave my country, what was most agreeable in it should first be snatched away from it.</P>
<P>I could overtake you with pleasure in—, and make that tour in your company. Every rea∣sonable entertainment and beautiful view would be doubly engaging when you partook of it. I should at least attend you to the sea coasts, and cast a last look after the sails that transported you. But perhaps I might care as little to stay behind you; and be full as uneasy to live in a country where I saw others persecuted by the rogues of my own religion, as where I was persecuted myself by the rogues of yours. And it is not impossible I might run into Asia in search of liberty; for who would not rather live a freeman among a nation of slaves, than a slave among a nation of freemen?</P>
<P>In good earnest, if I knew your motions, and your exact time; I verily think, I should be once more happy in a sight of you next spring.</P>

<P>YOU will find me more troublesome than ever Brutus did his evil Genius; I shall meet you in more places than one, and often refresh your memory before you arrive at your Philippi. These shadows of me (my letters) will be haunting you from time to time, and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffer'd very much from you, and whom you have robb'd of the most valuable of his enjoy∣ments, your conversation. The advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the risque I generally run of mani∣festing my own indiscretion. You then re∣warded my trust in you the moment it was given, for you pleas'd or inform'd me the mi∣nute you answer'd. I must now be contented with more slow returns. However, 'tis some pleasure, that your thoughts upon paper will be a more lasting possession to me, and that I shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss I have so often regretted, that of any thing you said, which I happen'd to forget. In earnest,

Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it must be every day of my life. I attend you in spirit thro' all your ways, I fol∣low you through every stage in books of tra∣vels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead tra∣vellers; and if I read of a delightful prospect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet subsists to please you. I enquire the roads, the amuse∣ments, the company, of every town and coun∣try thro' which you pass, with as much dili∣gence, as if I were to set out next week to overtake you. In a word, no one can have you more constantly in mind, not even your Guardian-angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge so much Popery as to fancy some Being takes care of you, who knows your value better than you do yourself: I am willing to think that Heaven never gave so much self∣neglect and resolution to a woman, to occasion her calamity; but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory.</P>
<P>Your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the first dove that return'd to Noah, and just made him know it had found no rest abroad.</P>
<P>There is nothing in it that pleases me, but when you tell me you had no sea-sickness. I
<PB N="205" REF="239"/>
beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no discoveries that will be half so va∣luable to me as those of your own mind. No∣thing that regards the states or kingdoms you pass thro', will engage so much of my curio∣sity or concern, as what relates to yourself: Your welfare, to say truth, is more at my heart than that of Christendom.</P>
<P>I am sure I may defend the truth, tho' per∣haps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubtful at best, of the merits of differing religions and governments: but pri∣vate virtues one can be sure of. I therefore know what particular Person has desert enough to merit being happier than others, but not what Nation deserves to conquer or oppress an∣other. You will say, I am not <HI>public-spirited;</HI> let it be so, I may have too many tendernesses, particular regards, or narrow views; but at the same time I am certain that whoever wants these, can never have a Public spirit; for (as a friend of mine says) how is it possible for that man to love twenty thousand people, who ne∣ver loved one?</P>
<P>I communicated your letter to Mr. C—, he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought, I mean as I do, and one always thinks that to be just as it ought. His health and mine are
<PB N="206" REF="240"/>
now so good, that we wish with all our souls you were a witness of it. We never meet but we lament over you: we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory, where we strow flowers of rhetoric, and offer such libations to your name as it would be profane to call Toasting. The Duke of B—m is sometimes the High Priest of your praises; and upon the whole, I believe there are as few men that are not sorry at your departure, as women that are; for, you know, most of your sex want good sense, and therefore must want generosity: You have so much of both, that, I am sure, you pardon them; for one cannot but forgive whatever one despises. For my part I hate a great many wo∣men for your sake, and undervalue all the rest. 'Tis you are to blame, and may God revenge it upon you, with all those blessings and earthly prosperities, which, the Divines tell us, are the cause of our perdition; for if he makes you happy in this world, I dare trust your own vir∣tue to do it in the other.</P>

<P>YOU are by this time satisfied how much the tenderness of one man of merit is to be preferred to the addresses of a thousand. And by this time the Gentleman you have made choice of is sensible, how great is the joy of having all those charms and good qualities which have pleased so many, now applied to please one only. It was but just, that the same Virtues which gave you reputation, should give you happiness; and I can wish you no greater, than that you may receive it in as high a degree yourself, as so much good humour must infal∣libly give it to your husband.</P>
<P>It may be expected, perhaps, that one who has the title of Poet should say something more polite on this occasion: But I am really more a well-wisher to your felicity, than a celebrater of your beauty. Besides, you are now a mar∣ried woman, and in a way to be a great many better things than a fine lady; such as an excel∣lent wife, a faithful friend, a tender parent, and at last, as the consequence of them all, a saint in heaven.

<P>I Return you the Book you were pleased to send me, and with it your obliging letter, which deserves my particular acknowledg∣ment; for, next to the pleasure of enjoying the company of so good a friend, the welcomest thing to me is to hear from him. I expected to find, what I have met with, an admirable genius in those Poems, not only because they were Milton's <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">L'Allegro Il Penseroso, Lycidas, and the Masque of Comus. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, or were approved by Sir Hen.

Only do not afford more cause of complaints against you, that you suffer nothing of yours to come abroad; which in this age, wherein wit and true sense is more scarce than money, is a piece of such cruelty as your best friends can hardly pardon. I hope you will repent and amend; I could offer many reasons to this purpose, and such as you cannot answer with any sincerity; but that I dare not enlarge, for fear of ingaging in a style of Compliment, which has been so abused by fools and knaves, that it is become al∣most scandalous.

<P>I Have this moment received the favour of yours of the 8th instant; and will make you a true excuse (tho' perhaps no very good one) that I deferred the troubling you with a letter,
<PB N="211" REF="245"/>
when I sent back your papers, in hopes of see∣ing you at Binfield before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I should freely now (as I have done too pre∣sumptuously in conversation with you) tell you my opinion; which I have frequently ventured to give you, rather in compliance with your desires than that I could think it reasonable. For I am not yet satisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of poetry, who never have been practised in the art. There may possibly be some happy genius's, who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read Vitruvius, or knowing any thing of the rules of architec∣ture: but this, tho' it may sometimes be in the right, must be subject to many mistakes, and is certainly but a superficial knowledge; without entring into the art, the methods, and the par∣ticular excellencies of the whole composure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Besides my want of skill, I have another reason why I ought to suspect myself, by rea∣son of the great affection I have for you; which might give too much bias to be kind to every thing that comes from you. But after all, I must say (and I do it with an old-fashion∣ed sincerity) that I entirely approve of your
<PB N="212" REF="246"/>
translation of those pieces of Homer, both as to the versification and the true sense that shines thro' the whole: Nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion, that you would proceed in translating that incomparable Poet, to make him speak good English, to dress his admirable characters in your proper, signifi∣cant, and expressive conceptions, and to make his works as useful and instructive to this de∣generate age, as he was to our friend Horace, when he read him at <HI>Praeneste: Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c. I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which I confess I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to send this presently to be added to the Miscellanies, and, I hope, it will come time enough for that purpose.</P>
<P>I have nothing to say of my Nephew B.'s observations, for he sent them to me so late, that I had not time to consider them; I dare say he endeavour'd very faithfully (though, he told me, very hastily) to execute your com∣mands.</P>

You have given me the truest satisfaction imaginable not only in making good the just opinion I have ever had of your reach of thought, and my Idea of your comprehensive genius; but like∣wise in that pleasure I take as an Englishman to see the French, even Boileau himself in his Lutrin, out-done in your poem: for you des∣cend, <HI>leviore plectro,</HI> to all the nicer touches, that your own observation and wit furnish, on such a subject as requires the finest strokes and the liveliest imagination.

<P>THough any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me, yet I must own your last letter made me uneasy; you really use a
<PB N="215" REF="249"/>
style of compliment, which I expect as little as I deserve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young lady. From the moment one sets up for an author, one must be treated as ceremoniously, that is as unfaithfully,
<Q><L>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</L></Q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural vanity which first makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a coxcomb for life. But I must grant it is a just judgment upon poets, that they, whose chief pretence is Wit, should be treated as they themselves treat Fools, that is, be cajol'd with praises. And, I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to say this, as if the obliging letter you sent me deserv'd this impu∣tation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what Caesar said of his wife: <Q>“It was not sufficient that he knew her to be chaste himself, but she she should not be so much as suspected.”</Q></P>
<P>As to the wonderful discoveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of myself, I treat it, as you who are in the secret, treat common news, as groundless reports of things at a distance; which I, who look into the true
<PB N="216" REF="250"/>
springs of the affair, in my own breast, know to have no foundation at all. For Fame, tho' it be (as Milton finely calls it) <HI>the last infirmity of noble minds,</HI> is scarce so strong a temptation as to warrant our loss of time here: it can ne∣ver make us lie down contentedly on a death∣bed, (as some of the Ancients are said to have done with that thought.) You, Sir, have your∣self taught me, that an easy situation at that hour can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unat∣tainable by the strongest endeavours of the wit, but may be gain'd by the sincere intentions of the heart only. As in the next world, so in this, the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind, not the extent of the capacity; friendship here is an emanation from the same source as beatitude there: the same benevolence and grateful disposition that quali∣fies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other. The utmost point of my desires in my present state terminates in the society and good-will of worthy men, which I look upon as no ill earnest and foretaste of the society and alliance of happy souls here∣after.</P>
<P>The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy, but causes me to set some value upon myself as a part of your

<P>I Have been almost every day employ'd in fol∣lowing your advice, and amusing myself in painting, in which I am most particularly obliged to Mr. Jervas, who gives me daily instructions and examples. As to poetical affairs, I am content at present to be a bare looker-on, and from a practitioner turn an admirer, which is (as the world goes) not very usual. Cato was not so much the wonder of Rome in his days, as he is of Britain in ours; and though all the foolish industry possible has been used to make it thought a party-play, yet what the author once said of another may the most properly in the world be apply'd to him, on this occa∣sion,</P>

back by the Tories on the other; while the author sweated behind the scenes with con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern to find their applause proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the case too of the prologue writer <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Himself.</NOTE>, who was clapp'd into a stanch whig, at almost every two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applauses of the opposite faction, my Lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth, who play'd Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and pre∣sented him with fifty guineas; in acknowledg∣ment (as he express'd it) for defending the cause of liberty so well against a Perpetual Dic∣tator. The whigs are unwilling to be distanc'd this way, and therefore design a present to the same Cato very speedily; in the mean time they are getting ready as good a sentence as the for∣mer on their side: so betwixt them, 'tis pro∣bable that Cato (as Dr. Garth express'd it) may have something to live upon, after he dies.</P>

<P>IT was one of the Enigma's of Pythagoras, <Q>“When the winds rise, worship the E∣cho.”</Q> A modern writer explains this to sig∣nify, <Q>“When popular tumults begin, retire to solitudes, or such places where Echo's are commonly found, rocks, woods, &amp;c.”</Q> I am rather of opinion it should be interpreted, <Q>“When rumours increase, and when there is abundance of noise and clamour, believe the second report:”</Q> This I think agrees more exactly with the echo, and is the more natu∣ral application of the symbol. However it be, either of these Precepts is extremely proper to be followed at this season; and I cannot but applaud your resolution of continuing in what you call your cave in the forest, this winter; and preferring the noise of breaking ice to that
<PB N="221" REF="255"/>
of breaking statesmen, the rage of storms to that of parties, the fury and ravage of floods and tempests, to the precipitancy of some, and the ruin of others, which, I fear, will be our daily prospects in London.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish myself with you, to contem∣plate the wonders of God in the firmament, ra∣ther than the madness of man on the earth. But I never had so much cause as now to com∣plain of my poetical star, that fixes me, at this tumultous time, to attend the gingling of rhymes and the measuring of syllables: to be almost the only trifler in the nation; and as ridiculous as the poet in Petronius, who, while all the rest in the ship were either labouring or praying for life, was scratching his head in a little room, to write a fine description of the tempest.</P>
<P>You tell me, you like the sound of no arms but those of Achilles: for my part I like them as little as any other arms. I listed myself in the battles of Homer, and I am no sooner in war, but, like most other folks, I wish my∣self out again.</P>
<P>I heartily join with you in wishing Quiet to our native country: Quiet in the state, which, like Charity in religion, is too much the per∣fection and happiness of either, to be broken or violated on any pretence or prospect what∣soever. Fire and sword, and fire and faggot,
<PB N="222" REF="256"/>
are equally my aversion. I can pray for oppo∣site parties, and for opposite religions, with great sincerity. I think to be a lover of one's country is a glorious elogy, but I do not think it so great an one as to be a lover of man∣kind.</P>
<P>I sometimes celebrate you under these deno∣minations, and join your health with that of the whole world; a truly catholic health, which far excels the poor narrow-spirited, ridiculous healths now in fashion, to this church, or that church. Whatever our teachers may say, they must give us leave at least to wish generously.

<P>I Should be asham'd of my long idleness, in not acknowledging your kind advice about Echo, and your most ingenious explanation of it relating to popular tumults; which I own to

I am obliged further to this method, by the most severe weather I ever felt; when, tho' I keep as near by the fire side as may be, yet <HI>gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis;</HI> and often I apprehend the circulation of the blood begins to be stop'd.

<P>I Send you Dennis's remarks on the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">On Criticism.</NOTE> Essay; which equally abound in just criticisms and fine railleries. The few observations in my hand in the margins, are what a morning's leisure permitted me to make purely for your perusal. For I am of opinion that such a cri∣tic, as you will find him by the latter part of his Book, is but one way to be properly answer'd, and that way I would not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time
<PB N="226" REF="260"/>
persecuted by fortune. This I knew not be∣fore; if I had, his name had been spared in the Essay, for that only reason. I can't conceive what ground he has for so excessive a resent∣ment; nor imagine how those <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>But Appius reddens at each word you speak,</L>
<L>And stares tremendous with a threat'ning eye,</L>
<L>Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.</L>
</LG></NOTE> three lines can be called a reflection on his person, which on∣ly describe him subject a little to anger on some occasions. I have heard of combatants so very furious, as to fall down themselves with that very blow which they design'd to lay heavy on their antagonists. But if Mr. Dennis's rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienced writers from scribling, he should frighten us with his verse, not prose: for I have often known, that, when all the pre∣cepts in the world would not reclaim a sinner, some very sad example has done the business. Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with reason, and I will al∣ter them in case of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury, and so serve instead of a friend. What he observes at the bottom of page 20 of his reflections, was objected to by yourself, and had been mended but for the haste of the press: I confess it what the English call a Bull, in the
<PB N="227" REF="261"/>
expression, tho' the sense be manifest enough: Mr. Dennis's Bulls are seldom in the expres∣sion, they are generally in the sense.</P>
<P>I shall certainly never make the least reply to him; not only because you advise me, but because I have ever been of opinion, that, if a book can't answer for itself to the public, 'tis to no sort of purpose for its author to do it <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In works of Poetry, and generally, in whatever con∣cerns the <HI>Composition</HI> of a book, this rule is a very good one. In controverted <HI>Opinions</HI> the case is different. The advancement of truth, or the defence of an Au∣thor's honest fame, may sometimes make it necessa∣ry, or expedient for him to answer the Objections made to his book.</NOTE>. If I am wrong in any sentiment of that Essay, I protest sincerely, I don't desire all the world should be deceived (which would be of very ill consequence) merely that I myself may be thought right (which is of very little conse∣quence.) I would be the first to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of myself; for (as I take it) when a man owns himself to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wiser than he was. But I have had an advantage by the publishing that book, which otherwise I should never have known; it has been the occasion of making me friends and open abettors, of several gentle∣men of known sense and wit; and of proving
<PB N="228" REF="262"/>
to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken some notice of by the world, or I should never be attacked thus in particular. I have read that 'twas a custom among the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> while a General rode in triumph, to have the common soldiers in the streets that railed at him and reproached him; to put him in mind, that tho' his services were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</P>
<P>You will see by this, that whoever sets up for wit in these days ought to have the con∣stancy of a primitive Christian, and be prepar∣ed to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it. But sure this is the first time that a Wit was at∣tacked for his <HI>Religion,</HI> as, you'll find, I am most zealously in this treatise; and you know, Sir, what alarms I have had from the <SUP>c</SUP> oppo∣site side on this account. Have I not reason to cry out with the poor fellow in <HI>Virgil,</HI></P>

The manner in which Mr. D. takes to pieces several particular lines, detached from their na∣tural places, may shew how easy it is to a ca∣viller to give a new sense, or a new nonsense to any thing. And indeed his constructions are not more wrested from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the hetorodox parts, as they called them.</P>
<P>Our friend the Abbe is not of that sort, who with the utmost candour and freedom has mo∣destly told me what others thought, and shewn himself one (as he very well expresses it) rather of a number than a party. The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks most sorts of learning flourished among them, and I am opinion, that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by them: he be∣lieves that in the most natural and obvious sense, that line (A second deluge learning over-run) will be understood of learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be understood only (as 'tis meant) of polite learning, criticism, poetry, &amp;c. which is the only learning concerned in the subject of the Essay. It is true, that the monks did pre∣serve what learning there was, about Nicholas the fifth's time; but those who succeeded fell into the depth of barbarism, or at least stood at a stay while others arose from thence, insomuch that even Erasmus and Reuchlin could hardly
<PB N="230" REF="264"/>
laugh them out of it. I am highly obliged to the Abbe's zeal in my commendation, and goodness in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his testifying some esteem for the book just at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour against it, is an instance of great ge∣nerosity and candour, which I shall ever ac∣knowledge.</P>

<P>IN your last you informed me of the mis∣taken zeal of some people, who seem to make it no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous, than doctors do that they are sick; only that they may magnify their own cure, and triumph over an imaginary dis∣temper. The simile objected to in my Essay,
<Q><L>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</L>
<L>To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.)</L></Q>
plainly concludes at this second line, where stands a full stop: and what follows <HI>(Meanly they seek, &amp;c.)</HI> speaks only of wit (which is meant by that blessing, and that sun) for how
<PB N="231" REF="265"/>
can the sun of faith be said to sublime the southern wits, and to ripen the genius's of northern climates? I fear, these gentlemen un∣derstand grammar as little as they do criticism: and, perhaps, out of good-nature to the monks, are willing to take from them the censure of ig∣norance, and to have it to themselves. The word <HI>they</HI> refers (as, I am sure, I meant, and as I thought every one must have known) to those Critics there spoken of, who are partial to some particular sett of writers, to the prejudice of all others. And the very simile itself, if twice read, may convince them, that the censure here of damning, lies not on our church at all, unless they call our church <HI>one small sect:</HI> and the cautious words <HI>(by each man)</HI> manifestly show it a general reflection on all such (who∣ever they are) who entertain those narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty; which the reformed ministers and presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living.</P>
<P>Yet after all, I promise you, Sir, if the alte∣ration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith tho' weak understanding, I will (though it were from no other principle than that of common good-nature) comply with it. And if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies (for it is in a very narrow compass) that stumbling-block, tho' it
<PB N="232" REF="266"/>
be but a little pebble, shall be removed out of their way. If the heat of these good dispu∣tants (who, I am afraid, being bred up to wrangle in the schools, cannot get rid of the humour all their lives) should proceed so far as to personal reflections upon me, I assure you, notwithstanding, I will do or say nothing, how∣ever provok'd (for some people can no more provoke than oblige) that is unbecoming the true character of a Catholic. I will set before me the example of that great man, and great saint, Erasmus; who in the midst of calumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I doubt this is not strictly true. See his Answers to Lee, archbishop of York.</NOTE>, and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christia∣nity. However, I would advise them to suffer the mention of him to pass unregarded, lest I should be forced to do that for his reputation which I would never do for my own; I mean, to vindicate so great a light of our church from the malice of past times, and the ignorance of the present, in a language which may extend farther than that in which the trifle about criti∣cism is written. I wish these gentlemen would be contented with finding fault with me only, who will submit to them right or wrong, as far as I only am concerned; I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb
<PB N="233" REF="267"/>
it for things of so little consequence as my cre∣dit and my sense. A little humility can do a poet no hurt, and a little charity would do a priest none: for, as St. Austin finely says, <HI>Ubi charitas, ibi humilitas; ubi humilitas, ibi pax.</HI></P>

<P>THE concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation, by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy Vandals have thought fit to pass upon me, makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of setting before you, in a clear light, the true state of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believed the best piece of service one could do to our religion, was openly to ex∣press our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and <HI>piae fraudes,</HI> which it stands so little in need of, and which have laid it un∣der so great a scandal among its enemies.</P>
<P>Nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them, as that too peremptory and uncharitable
<PB N="234" REF="268"/>
assertion of an utter impossibility of salvation to all but ourselves: invincible ignorance excepted, which indeed some people define under so great limitations, and with such exclusions, that it seems as if that word were rather invented as a salvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl∣ed about so freely on almost all mankind by the hands of ecclesiastics) than as a real exception to almost universal damnation. For besides the small number of the truly faithful in our Church, we must again subdivide; the Janse∣nist is damned by the Jesuit, the Jesuit by the Jansenist, the Scotist by the Thomist, and so forth.</P>
<P>There may be Errors, I grant, but I can't think them of such consequence as to destroy utterly the Charity of mankind; the very great∣est bond in which we are ingaged by God to one another: therefore, I own to you, I was glad of any opportunity to express my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the reli∣gion I profess are commonly charged with; and I hoped, a slight insinuation, introduced so easi∣ly by a casual similitude only, could never have given offence; but on the contrary must needs have done good; in a nation and time, wherein we are the smaller party, and consequently
<PB N="235" REF="269"/>
most misrepresented, and most in need of vin∣dication.</P>
<P>For the same reason, I took occasion to men∣tion the superstition of some ages after the sub∣version of the Roman Empire, which is too manifest a truth to be denied, and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith, who are free from it. Our silence in these points may, with some reason, make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those bigotries; which yet in reality all good and sen∣sible men despise, tho' they are persuaded not to speak against them, I can't tell why, since now 'tis no way the interest even of the worst of our priesthood (as it might have been then) to have them smothered in silence: For, as the opposite sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being slander'd; 'tis our business now to vindicate ourselves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't so well be brought about with serious faces; we must laugh with them at what deserves it, or be content to be laughed at, with such as deserve it.</P>
<P>As to particulars: you cannot but have ob∣served, that at first the whole objection against the simile of Wit and Faith lay to the word They: when that was beyond contradiction re∣moved (the very grammar serving to confute
<PB N="236" REF="270"/>
them) then the objection was against the simile itself; or if that simile will not be objected to (sense and common reason being indeed a little stubborn, and not apt to give way to every bo∣dy) next the mention of Superstition must be∣come a crime; as if Religion and she were sisters, or that it were scandal upon the family of Christ, to say a word against the devil's bastard. Afterwards, more mischief is discover'd in a place that seemed innocent at first, the two lines about <HI>Schismatics.</HI> An ordinary man would imagine the author plainly declared against those schismatics, for quitting the true faith out of a contempt of the understanding of some few of its believers: but these believers are called <HI>dull,</HI> and because I say that those schis∣matics think some believers dull, therefore these charitable interpreters of my meaning will have it, that I think all believers dull. I was lately telling Mr. ** these objections: who as∣sured me I had said nothing which a catholic need to disown; and I have cause to know that gentleman's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head, which, I confess, I can't but acquiesce in; that when a sett of people are piqued at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage, their me∣thod of revenge on the truth-speaker is to attack his reputation a by-way, and not openly to ob∣ject
<PB N="237" REF="271"/>
to the place they are really galled by: what these therefore (in his opinion) are in earnest angry at, is, that Erasmus, whom their tribe oppressed and persecuted, should be vindicated after an age of obloquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an honest truth in be∣half of the dead, whom no man sure will flat∣ter and to whom few will do justice. Others, you know, were as angry that I mentioned Mr. Walsh with honour; who as he never refused to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him, so honestly deserved it from all others, tho' of ever so different interests or sentiments. May I be ever guilty of this sort of liberty, and latitude of principle! which gives us the hardi∣ness of speaking well of those whom envy op∣presses even after death. As I would always speak well of my living friends when they are absent, nay because they are absent, so would I much more of the dead, in that eternal ab∣sence; and the rather because I expect no thanks for it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see I do in my conscience persist in what I have written; yet in my friendship I will recant and alter whatever you please, in case of a second edition (which I think the book will not so soon arrive at, for Tonson's printer told me he drew off a thou∣sand copies in this first impression, and, I fancy,
<PB N="238" REF="272"/>
a treatise of this nature, which not one gentle∣man in threescore even of a liberal education can understand, can hardly exceed the vent of that number.) You shall find me a true Tro∣jan in my faith and friendship, in both which I will persevere to the end</P>

<P>I Thank you for having given my poem of Windsor Forest its greatest ornament, that of bearing your name in the front of it. 'Tis one thing when a person of true merit permits us to have the honour of drawing him as like as we can; and another, when we make a fine thing at random, and persuade the next vain creature we can find that 'tis his own likeness; which is the case every day of my fellow scrib∣blers.

<P>IT is not only the disposition I always have of conversing with you, that makes me so speedily answer your obliging letter, but the apprehension lest your charitable intent of writ∣ing to my Lady A. on Mrs. W.'s affair should be frustrated, by the short stay she makes there. She went thither on the 25th with that mix∣ture of expectation and anxiety, with which people usually go into unknown or half-disco∣ver'd countries, utterly ignorant of the disposi∣tions of the inhabitants, and the treatment they

The unfortunate of all peo∣ple are the most unfit to be left alone; yet, we see, the world generally takes care they shall be so: whereas, if we took a considerate prospect of the world, the business and study of the hap∣py and easy should be to divert and humour, as well as comfort and pity, the distressed. I cannot therefore excuse some near Allies of mine for their conduct of late towards this Lady, which has given me a great deal of anger as well as sorrow: all I shall say to you of them at present is, that they have not been my Rela∣tions these two months.

I am afraid to insinuate to you how much I esteem you: Flatterers have taken up the style which was once peculiar to friends, and an honest man has now no way left to ex∣press himself besides the common one of knaves: so that true friends now-a-days differ in their address from flatterers, much as right mastiffs

<P>YOU have at length complied with the re∣quest I have often made you, for you have shown me, I must confess, several of my faults in the sight of those letters. Upon a review of them, I find many things that would give me shame, if I were not more desirous to be thought honest than prudent; so many things freely thrown out, such lengths of unreserved friend∣ship, thoughts just warm from the brain, with∣out any polishing or dress, the very dishabile of the understanding. You have proved yourself more tender of another's embryo's than the fondest mothers are of their own, for you have
<PB N="244" REF="278"/>
preserv'd every thing that I miscarried of. Since I know this, I shall in one respect be more afraid of writing to you than ever, at this care∣less rate, because I see my evil works may again rise in judgment against me; yet in an∣other respect I shall be less afraid, since this has given me such a proof of the extreme indul∣gence you afford to my slightest thoughts. The revisal of these letters has been a kind of exa∣mination of conscience to me; so fairly and faithfully have I set down in them from time to time the true and undisguised state of my mind. But I find, that these, which were intended as sketches of my friendship, give as imperfect images of it, as the little landscapes we com∣monly see in black and white do of a beautiful country; they can represent but a very small part of it, and that deprived of the life and lu∣stre of nature. I perceive that the more I en∣deavour'd to render manifest the real affection and value I ever had for you, I did but injure it by representing less and less of it: as glasses which are design'd to make an object very clear, generally contract it. Yet as when peo∣ple have a full idea of a thing first upon their own knowledge, the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance, and are not displeas∣ing on that score; so, I hope, the foreknowledge
<PB N="245" REF="279"/>
you had of my esteem for you, is the reason that you do not dislike my letters.</P>
<P>They will not be of any great service (I find) in the design I mentioned to you: I believe I had better steal from a richer man, and plun∣der your letters (which I have kept as care∣fully as I would Letters Patents, since they in∣title me to what I more value than titles of ho∣nour.) You have some cause to apprehend this usage from me, if what some say be true, that I am a great borrower; however I have hi∣therto had the luck that none of my creditors have challenged me for it: and those who say it are such, whose writings no man ever bor∣row'd from, so have the least reason to com∣plain; and whose works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own. Another has been pleas'd to declare, that my verses are corrected by other men: I verily believe theirs were never corrected by any man: but indeed if mine have not, 'twas not my fault; I have endeavour'd my utmost that they should. But these things are only whisper'd, and I will not encroach upon Bays's province and <HI>pen-whispers,</HI> so hasten to conclude</P>

<P>I Am at a solitude, an house between Hamp∣stead and London, wherein Sir Charles Sed∣ley died. This circumstance set me a thinking and ruminating upon the employments in which men of wit exercise themselves. It was said of Sir Charles, who breath'd his last in this room,</P>

<P>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter, by which I find you shift the scene of your life from the town to the country, and enjoy that mix'd state which wise men both delight in, and are qualified for. Methinks the moralists and philosophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending entire∣ly either solitude, or publick life. In the for∣mer, men for the most part grow useless by too much rest, and in the latter are destroy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying still, pu∣trify, and are good for nothing, and running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others, and are swallow'd up and lost the sooner themselves. Those indeed who can be useful to all states, should be like gentle streams, that not only glide thro' lonely val∣leys and forests amidst the flocks and the shep∣herds, but visit populous towns in their course, and are at once of ornament and service to them. But there are another sort of people who seem design'd for solitude, such, I mean, as have more to hide than to show. As for my own part, I am one of those of whom Seneca says, <HI>I am</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="286"/>
<HI>umbratiles sunt, ut putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce est.</HI> Some men, like some pictures, are fitter for a corner than a full light; and, I be∣lieve, such as have a natural bent to solitude (to carry on the former similitude) are like waters, which may be forced into fountains, and ex∣alted into a great height, may make a noble figure and a louder noise, but after all they would run more smoothly, quietly, and plen∣tifully, in their own natural course upon the ground <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The foregoing Simili∣tudes our Author had put into verse some years before, and inserted into Mr. Wy∣cherley's poem on <HI>Mix'd Life.</HI> We find them in the versification very distinct from the rest of that poem. See his posthumous works, octavo, Page 3 and 4. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. The consideration of this would make me very well contented with the posses∣sion only of that Quiet which Cowley calls the companion of Obscurity. But whoever has the Muses too for his companions, can never be idle enough, to be uneasy. Thus, Sir, you see, I would flatter myself into a good opinion of my own way of living. Plutarch just now told me, that 'tis in human life as in a game at tables, where a man may wish for the high∣est cast, but, if his chance be otherwise, he is e'en to play it well as he can, and to make the best of it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 15, 1712.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU formerly observ'd to me, that no∣thing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the disparity we often find in him sick and well: thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a misera∣ble example of the weakness of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had fre∣quent opportunities of late to consider myself in these different views, and, I hope, have receiv'd some advantage by it, if what Waller says be true, that
<Q><L>The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>
<L>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</L></Q>
Then surely sickness, contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffold∣ing of the body, may discover the inward structure more plainly. Sickness is a sort of early old age: it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state, and inspires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thousand volumes of philosophers and divines. It gives so warning a concussion to those props of our vanity, our
<PB N="254" REF="288"/>
strength and youth, that we think of fortifying ourselves within, when there is so little depend∣ance upon our out-works. Youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gen∣tler and smoother manner than age: 'tis like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank, and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight, but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret. My youth has dealt more fair∣ly and openly with me, it has afforded several prospects of my danger, and given me an ad∣vantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the world have not dazzled me very much; and I begin, where most peo∣ple end, with a full conviction of the empti∣ness of all sorts of ambition, and the unsatis∣factory nature of all human pleasures. When a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tene∣ment of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honest Hi∣bernian, who being in bed in the great storm some years ago, and told the house would tum∣ble over his head, made answer, What care I for the house? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the best time to die when one is in the best hu∣mour; and so excessively weak as I now am, I may say with conscience, that I am not at all uneasy at the thought, that many men, whom I never had any esteem for, are likely to enjoy
<PB N="255" REF="289"/>
this world after me. When I reflect what an inconsiderable little atom every single man is, with respect to the whole creation, methinks, 'tis a shame to be concern'd at the removal of such a trivial animal as I am. The morning after my exit, the sun will rise as bright as ever, the flowers smell as sweet, the plants spring as green, the world will proceed in its old course, people will laugh as heartily, and marry as fast, as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is elegantly express'd in the Book of Wisdom) passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day. There are reasons enough, in the fourth chapter of the same book, to make any young man content∣ed with the prospect of death. <Q>“For honour∣able age is not that which standeth in length of time, or is measur'd by number of years. But wisdom is the grey hair to men, and an unspotted life is old age. He was taken away speedily, lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul,”</Q> &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Was the other day in company with five or six men of some learning; where chancing to mention the famous verses which the Em∣peror Adrian spoke on his death-bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of gaiety unwor∣thy of that prince in those circumstances. I could not but differ from this opinion: me∣thinks it was by no means a gay, but a very serious soliloquy to his soul at the point of its departure; in which sense I naturally took the verses at my first reading them, when I was very young, and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put upon them.</P>

<P>I confess I cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this: 'tis the most natural and obvious reflection imaginable to a dying man: and if we consider the Emperor was a heathen, that doubt concerning the future fate of his soul will seem so far from being the effect of want of thought, that 'twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise; not to mention that here is a plain confession included of his belief in its immortality. The diminutive epithets of <HI>vagula, blandula,</HI> and the rest, appear not to me as expressions of levity, but rather of en∣dearment and concern; such as we find in Ca∣tullus, and the authors of <HI>Hendeca-syllabi</HI> after him, where they are used to express the ut∣most love and tenderness for their mistresses.—If you think me right in my notion of the last words of Adrian, be pleas'd to insert it in the Spectator; if not, to suppress it.</P>

<P>I Am sorry you published that notion about Adrian's verses as mine: had I imagined you would use my name, I should have ex∣press'd my sentiments with more modesty and diffidence. I only sent it to have your opinion, and not to publish my own, which I distrust∣ed. But, I think the supposition you draw from the notion of Adrian's being addicted to magic, is a little uncharitable, ("that he might "fear no sort of deity, good or bad") since in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehen∣sion of a future state, by being solicitous whither his soul was going. As to what you mention of
<PB N="261" REF="295"/>
his using gay and ludicrous expressions, I have own'd my opinion to be, that the expressions are not so, but that diminutives are as often, in the Latin tongue, used as marks of tenderness and concern.</P>

To be uncensured and to be obscure, is the same thing.

<P>I Have receiv'd your letter, and am glad to find that you have laid so good a scheme for your great undertaking. I question not but
<PB N="267" REF="301"/>
the Prose<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The notes to his translation of Homer.</NOTE> will require as much care as the Poetry, but the variety will give yourself some relief, and more pleasure to your readers.</P>
<P>You gave me leave once to take the liberty of a friend, in advising you not to content your∣self with one half of the Nation for your ad∣mirers when you might command them all. If I might take the freedom to repeat it, I would on this occasion. I think you are very happy that you are out of the Fray, and I hope all your undertakings will turn to the better ac∣count for it.</P>
<P>You see how I presume on your friendship in taking all this freedom with you: But I alrea∣dy fancy that we have lived many years toge∣ther in an unreserved conversation, and that we may do so many more, is the sincere wish of</P>

<P>YOUR last is the more obliging, as it hints at some little niceties in my con∣duct, which your candour and affection prompts you to recommend to me, and which (so tri∣vial
<PB N="268" REF="302"/>
as things of this nature seem) are yet of no slight consequence, to people whom every body talks of and every body as he pleases. 'Tis a sort of Tax that attends an estate in Par∣nassus, which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small possession an author holds. For indeed an author, who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thanked for the pleasure, and sometimes ill∣treated by those very persons who first debauch∣ed him. Yet, to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way displeased that I have of∣fended the violent of all parties already; and at the same time I assure you conscientiously, I feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me, or are dissatisfied with me. This frame of mind is so easy, that I am perfectly content with my condition.</P>
<P>As I hope, and would flatter myself, that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either, so 'tis a plea∣sure to me that you guess'd so right in regard to the author of that Guardian you mentioned. But I am sorry to find it has taken air, that I have some hand in those papers, because I write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people, nor the disre∣pute of it with others. An honest Jacobite
<PB N="269" REF="303"/>
spoke to me the sense or nonsense of the weak part of his party very fairly, that the good peo∣ple took it ill of me, that I writ with Steele, tho' upon never so indifferent subjects. This, I know, you will laugh at as well as I do; yet I doubt not but many little calumniators and persons of sour dispositions will take occasion hence to bespatter me. I confess I scorn nar∣row souls, of all parties, and if I renounce my reason in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pass that the few Guardians I have written are so gene∣rally known for mine: that in particular which you mention I never discovered to any man but the publisher, till very lately: yet almost every body told me of it.</P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politic turn, I can∣not any way enter into that secret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the rest of his politics. Tho' 'tis said, he will take into these papers also several subjects of the politer kind, as before: But, I assure you, as to my∣self, I have quite done with them for the fu∣ture. The little I have done, and the great respect I bear Mr. Steele as a man of wit, has rendered me a suspected Whig to some of the violent; but (as old Dryden said before me) 'tis not the violent I design to please.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="304"/>
I generally employ the mornings in painting with Mr. Jervas <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Epistle to him in verse, writ about this time. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, and the evenings in the con∣versation of such as I think can most improve my mind, of whatever denomination they are. I ever must set the highest value upon men of truly great, that is honest principles, with equal capacities. The best way I know of over∣coming calumny and misconstruction, is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right, and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it. 'Tis partly from this maxim that I depend upon your friendship, because I believe it will do justice to my intention in every thing; and give me leave to tell you, that (as the world goes) this is no small assurance I re∣pose in you.</P>

<P>I Have been lying in wait for my own ima∣gination, this week and more, and watch∣ing what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy, that were worth communicating to you in a letter. But I am at length convinced that
<PB N="271" REF="305"/>
my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort; so I must e'en be contented with telling you the old story, that I love you heartily. I have often found by experience, that nature and truth, tho' never so low or vulgar, are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented: It would be diverting to me to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent inconsistencies and tautologies just as it thought them. This makes me hope a letter from me will not be unwelcome to you, when I am con∣scious I write with more unreservedness than ever man wrote, or perhaps talk'd to another. I trust your good-nature with the whole range of my follies, and really love you so well, that I would rather you should pardon me than esteem me; since one is an act of goodness and benevolence, the other a kind of constrained deference.</P>
<P>You can't wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent, when I tell you how they are dis∣tracted. Every hour of my life my mind is strangely divided; this minute perhaps I am above the stars, with a thousand systems round about me, looking forward into a vast abyss, and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of Creation, in dialogues with Whiston and the Astronomers; the next mo∣ment I am below all trifles groveling with T*
<PB N="272" REF="306"/>
in the very centre of nonsense: Now I am re∣created with the brisk sallies and quick turns of wit, which Mr. Steele in his liveliest and freest humours darts about him; and now le∣velling my application to the insignificant ob∣servations and quirks of Grammar of C* and D*.</P>
<P>Good God! what an incongruous animal is man! how unsettled in his best part, his soul; and how changing and variable in his frame of body? the constancy of the one shook by eve∣ry notion, the temperament of the other affect∣ed by every blast of wind! What is he altoge∣ther but one mighty inconsistency; sickness and pain is the lot of one half of him: doubt and fear the portion of the other! What a bustle we make about passing our time, when all our space is but a point? what aims and ambi∣tions are crowded into this little instant of our life, which (as Shakespear finely words it) is rounded with a sleep? Our whole extent of be∣ing is no more, in the eye of him who gave it, than a scarce perceptible moment of dura∣tion. Those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the natura∣lists tell us, are yet as long-lived and possess as wide a scene of action as man, if we consider him with a view to all Space, and all Eternity. Who knows what plots, what atchievements a
<PB N="273" REF="307"/>
mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust, within his life of some minutes; and of how much less consideration than even this, is the life of man in the sight of God, who is from ever, and for ever?</P>
<P>Who that thinks in this train, but must see the world and its contemptible grandeurs, lessen before him at every thought? 'Tis enough to make one remain stupify'd in a poize of in∣action, void of all desires, of all designs, of all friendships.</P>
<P>But we must return (thro' our very condition of being) to our narrow selves, and those things that affect ourselves: our passions, our interests flow in upon us, and unphilosophize us into mere mortals. For my part, I never return so much into myself, as when I think of you, whose friendship is one of the best comforts I have for the insignificancy of myself.</P>

<P>YOUR letter found me very busy in my grand undertaking, to which I must whol∣ly
<PB N="274" REF="308"/>
give myself up for some time, unless when I snatch an hour to please myself with a distant conversation with you and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no comfortable prospect to be reflecting, that so long a siege as that of Troy lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progress. Indeed the Greek fortification upon a nearer ap∣proach does not appear so formidable as it did, and I am almost apt to flatter myself, that Ho∣mer secretly seems inclined to a correspondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are, indeed, a sort of un∣derling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators and Critics, who would frighten many people by their number and bulk, and perplex our progress under pretence of fortifying their author. These lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have digged, encompassed with dirt of their own heaping up; but, I think, there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by min∣ing under ground, that is, by using the poeti∣cal engines, wings, and flying over their heads <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is a strange con∣fusion in this long continued metaphor: sometimes the <HI>fortifications</HI> spoken of are to keep the ignorant out, some∣times to let them in, and sometimes only to quibble with, as in the words <HI>[un∣der pretence of fortifying their author.]</HI> But it is no matter. The Critics and Commenta∣tors are to be abused, and any thing serves to do that.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="309"/>
While I am engaged in the fight, I find you are concerned how I shall be paid, and are so∣licitous that I may not have the ill fate of many discarded Generals, to be first envied and ma∣lign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and lastly neg∣lected. The former (the constant attendant upon all great and laudable enterprizes) I have already experienced. Some have said I am not a master in the Greek, who either are so them∣selves or are not: if they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without hav∣ing catechiz'd me. But if they can read (for, I know, some critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying before them some speci∣mens of my translation from this Author in the Miscellanies, which they are heartily wel∣come to. I have met with as much malignity another way, some calling me a Tory, because the heads of that party have been distinguish∣ingly favourable to me; some a Whig, because I have been favoured with yours, Mr. Con∣greve's, and Mr. Craggs's friendship, and of late with my lord Hallifax's patronage. How much more natural a conclusion might be formed, by any good-natured man, that a per∣son who has been well used by all sides, has
<PB N="276" REF="310"/>
been offensive to none. This miserable age is so sunk between animosities of Party and those of Religion, that I begin to fear, most men have Politics enough to make (thro' violence) the best scheme of government a bad one: and Belief enough to hinder their own salvation. I hope for my own part never to have more of either than is consistent with common Justice and Charity, and always as much as becomes a Christian and honest man. Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a Papist here, where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much or too little; I shall yet be easy under both their mistakes, and be what I more than seem to be, for I suffer for it. God is my witness that I no more envy you Protestants your places and possessions, than I do our Priests, their charity or learning. I am ambitious of nothing but the good opinion of good men, on both sides; for I know that one virtue of a free spi∣rit is worth more than all the virtues put to∣gether of all the narrow-soul'd people in the world.</P>

<P>I Have been acquainted by<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See two Letters, from Mr. Jervas, and the Answer to it. N<SUP>o</SUP> 22, 23. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> one of my friends, who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for you can deserve. May I hope that some late malevolencies have lost their ef∣fect? indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene∣mies, to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not; but if you would judge by probabilities, I beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has so little interest in pretending to be so? Methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who de∣sires no real service. I am only to get as much from the Whigs, as I got from the Tories, that is to say, Civility; being neither so proud as to be insensible of any good office, nor so hum∣ble, as not to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice.</P>
<P>I will not value myself upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you: for
<PB N="278" REF="312"/>
(to say the truth) all the world speaks well of you, and I should be under a necessity of doing the same, whether I car'd for you or not.</P>
<P>As to what you have said of me, I shall ne∣ver believe that the author of Cato can speak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you sincere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two first books of my translation of Homer, which are in the hands of my Lord Hallifax. I am sen∣sible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your good-will, when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice; and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts, at the same time that you tell others your most favourable ones.</P>
<P>I have a farther request, which I must press with earnestness. My bookseller is reprinting the Essay on Criticism, to which you have done too much honour in your Spectator of N<SUP>o</SUP> 253. The period in that paper, where you say, <Q>“I have admitted some strokes of ill-nature into that Essay,”</Q> is the only one I could wish omitted of all you have written; but I would not desire it should be so, unless I had the me∣rit of removing your objection. I beg you but
<PB N="279" REF="313"/>
to point out those strokes to me, and, you may be assured, they shall be treated without mercy.</P>
<P>Since we are upon proofs of sincerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advan∣tage of us both in each other's opinion) give me leave to name another passage in the same Spec∣tator, which I wish you would alter. It is where you mention an observation upon Ho∣mer's Verses of Sisyphus's Stone, as<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">These words are since left out in Mr. Tickel's E∣dition, but were extant in all during Mr. Addison's life. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> never ha∣ving been made before by any of the Critics: I happened to find the same in Dionysius of Halicarnassus's Treatise, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who treats very largely upon these verses.

<P>THE question you ask in relation to Mr. Addison and Philips, I shall answer in a
<PB N="280" REF="314"/>
few words. Mr. Philips did express himself with much indignation against me one evening at Button's Coffee-house (as I was told) say∣ing, that I was enter'd into a cabal with Dean Swift and others to write against the Whig-Interest, and in particular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends Steele and Addison: but Mr. Philips never opened his lips to my face, on this or any like occasion, tho' I was almost every night in the same room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. Addison came to me a night or two after Philips had talk'd in this idle manner, and as∣sur'd me of his disbelief of what had been said, of the friendship we should always maintain, and desir'd I would say nothing further of it. My Lord Hallifax did me the honour to stir in this matter, by speaking to several people to obviate a false aspersion, which might have done me no small prejudice with one party. How∣ever Philips did all he could secretly to conti∣nue the report with the Hanover Club, and kept in his hands the subscriptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have since given him to understand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with such a man) I would not ask him for this money, but commission'd one of the Players, his equals, to receive it. This is the
<PB N="281" REF="315"/>
whole matter; but as to the secret grounds<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">They were Mr. Pope's writing the ironical compa∣rison between his and Phi∣lips's Pastorals, in the Guar∣dian.</NOTE> of this malignity, they will make a very pleasant history when we meet. Mr. Congreve and some others have been much diverted with it, and most of the gentlemen of the Hanover Club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their Secretary. It is to this management of Phi∣lips, that the world owes Mr. Gay's Pastorals. The ingenious author is extremely your ser∣vant, and would have comply'd with your kind invitation, but that he is just now appointed Se∣cretary to my Lord Clarendon, in his embassy to Hanover.</P>
<P>I am sensible of the zeal and friendship with which, I am sure, you will always defend your friend in his absence, from all those little tales and calumnies, which a man of any genius or merit is born to. I shall never complain while I am happy in such noble defenders, and in such contemptible opponents.

<P>YOU mention the account I gave you some time ago of the things which Philips said in his foolishness: but I can't tell from any thing in your letter, whether you received a long one from me about a fortnight since. It was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence. I there launch'd into some account of my temporal af∣fairs, and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual. The conclusion of your let∣ter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you prayed for me. Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of most other friends, who ne∣ver talk of praying for a man after they have done him a service, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human sciences, which, I assure you, I am daily more convinced of; and indeed I have, for some years past, look'd upon all of them no better than amusements. To make them the ultimate end of our pursuit, is a miserable and short am∣bition, which will drop from us at every little disappointment here, and even, in case of no
<PB N="283" REF="317"/>
disappointments here, will infallibly desert us hereafter. The utmost fame they are capable of bestowing, is never worth the pains they cost us, and the time they lose us. If you at∣tain the top of your desires that way, all those who envy you will do you harm; and of those who admire you, few will do you good. The unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies, and probably the successful your secret ones: for those hate not more to be excell'd, than these to be rival'd: And at the upshot, after a life of perpetual application, you reflect that you have been doing nothing for yourself, and that the same or less industry might have gain'd you a friendship that can never deceive or end, a satisfaction, which praise cannot bestow nor vanity feel, and a glory, which (tho' in one respect like fame, not to be had till after death) yet shall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. These, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my sentiments, when∣ever I think at all: for half the things that em∣ploy our heads deserve not the name of thoughts, they are only stronger dreams of impressions upon the imagination: our schemes of govern∣ment, our systems of philosophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but so many shadowy images, and airy prospects, which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent, as
<PB N="284" REF="318"/>
we are more overcast with the darkness, and disturbed with the fumes, of human vanity.</P>
<P>The same thing that makes old men willing to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long habit, and weariness of the same track. Homer will work a cure upon me; fif∣teen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years, to make one old in rhyme: and I should be sorry and ashamed, to go on jingling to the last step, like a waggoner's horse, in the same road, and so leave my bells to the next silly animal that will be proud of them. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of Reason, who is measuring syllables and coupling rhymes, when he should be mending his own soul, and securing his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I should be unworthy even of those small and limited parts which God has given me; and unworthy of the friendship of such a man as you.</P>

<P>I Have no better excuse to offer you, that I have omitted a task naturally so pleasing to me as conversing upon paper with you, but
<PB N="285" REF="319"/>
that my time and eyes have been wholly em∣ploy'd upon Homer, whom, I almost fear, I shall find but one way of imitating, which is, in his blindness. I am perpetually afflicted with head-achs, that very much affect my sight, and indeed since my coming hither I have scarce past an hour agreeably, except that in which I read your letter. I would seriously have you think, you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendship, than he who least deserves it on all other accounts than his due sense of it. But, let me tell you, you can hardly guess what a task you under∣take, when you profess yourself my friend; there are some Tories who will take you for a Whig, some Whigs who will take you for a Tory, some Protestants who will esteem you a rank Papist, and some Papists who will account you a Heretic.</P>
<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men. The notions of right and wrong are so far strain'd, that perhaps to be in the right so very violently, may be of worse consequence than to be easily and quietly in the wrong. I really wish all men so well, that, I am satisfied, but few can wish me so; but if those few are such as tell me they do, I am content, for they are
<PB N="286" REF="320"/>
the best people I know. While you believe me what I profess as to religion, I can bear any thing the bigotted may say; while Mr. Con∣greve likes my poetry, I can endure Dennis, and a thousand more like him; while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can easily bear that the most violent and mad of all parties rise up to throw dirt at me.</P>
<P>I must expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my Homer. Whoever in our times would be a professor of learning above his fellows, ought at the very first to enter the world with the constancy and resolution of a primitive Christian, and be prepared to suffer all sort of public persecution. It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but en∣deavour to distinguish himself, or gratify others by his studies, he is immediately treated as a common enemy, instead of being looked upon as a common friend; and assaulted as generally as if his whole design were to prejudice the State or ruin the Public. I will venture to say, no man ever rose to any degree of perfection in writing, but thro' obstinacy, and an inveterate resolution against the stream of mankind: So that if the world has received any benefit from the labours of the learned, it was in its own despite. For when first they essay their parts,
<PB N="287" REF="321"/>
all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then some particular persons, who were before unfortunate in their own at∣tempts, are sworn foes to them only because they succeed.—Upon the whole, one may say of the best writers, that they pay a severe fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please.</P>

I have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of Poetry, for it takes me up so entirely, that I scarce see what passes under my nose, and hear nothing that is said about me.

I now and then just miss you as I step into bed; this minute indeed I want extremely to see
<PB N="290" REF="324"/>
you, the next I shall dream of nothing but the taking of Troy, or the recovery of Briseis.</P>
<P>I fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours, because, I am pretty sure, there never was a friendship of so easy a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Vanity we have expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Artist you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope, (pi∣ously hope) to hear these things. At home we follow our business, when we have any; and think and talk most of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friend∣ship of a stay'd man and his wife, who are seldom so fond as to hinder the business of the house from going on all day, or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the last, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantic friend∣ships, like violent loves, begin with disquiets, proceed to jealousies, and conclude in animosi∣ties. I have lived to see the fierce advance∣ment, the sudden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of these enormous friendships, and am perfectly convinced of the truth of a maxim we once agreed in, that nothing hinders
<PB N="291" REF="325"/>
the constant agreement of people who live to∣gether, but merely vanity; a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity of merit, and an inward expectation of such an Over∣measure of deference and regard, as answers to their own extravagant false scale; and which no body can pay, because none but themselves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts.</P>

<P>I Have a particular to tell you at this time, which pleases me so much, that you must expect a more than ordinary alacrity in every turn. You know I could keep you in sus∣pence for twenty lines, but I will tell you di∣rectly, that Mr. Addison and I have had a con∣versation, that it would have been worth your while to have been placed behind the wainscot, or behind some half-length picture, to have heard. He assur'd me, that he would make use not only of his interest, but of his art to do you some service; he did not mean his art of poetry, but his art at Court; and he is sensible
<PB N="292" REF="326"/>
that nothing can have a better air for himself than moving in your favour, especially since in∣sinuations were spread, that he did not care you should prosper too much as a poet. He pro∣tests that it shall not be his fault, if there is not the best intelligence in the world, and the most hearty friendship, &amp;c. He owns, he was a∣fraid Dr. Swift might have carried you too far among the enemy, during the heat of the ani∣mosity; but now all is safe, and you are es∣cap'd even in his opinion. I promis'd in your name, like a good Godfather, not that you should renounce the devil and all his works, but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake; therefore prepare yourself for some civilities.</P>
<P>I have done Homer's head, shadow'd and heighten'd carefully; and I inclose the out-line of the same size, that you may determine whe∣ther you would have it so large, or reduced to make room for feuillage or laurel round the oval, or about the square of the Busto? perhaps there is something more solemn in the image itself, if I can get it well perform'd.</P>
<P>If I have been instrumental in bringing you and Mr. Addison together with all sincerity, I value myself upon it as an acceptable piece of service to such a one as I know you to be.</P>

<P>I Am just arrived from Oxford, very well di∣verted and entertain'd there. Every one is much concern'd for the Queen's death. No panegyrics ready yet for the King.</P>
<P>I admire your whig-principles of resistance exceedingly, in the spirit of the Barcelonians: I join in your wish for them. Mr. Addison's verses on Liberty, in his letter from Italy, would be a good form of prayer in my opinion, <HI>O Li∣berty! thou Goddess heavenly bright!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What you mention of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr. Addison and me, deserves acknowledgments on my part. You thoroughly know my regard to his cha∣racter, and my propensity to testify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the scandalous meanness of that proceeding which was used by Philips, to make a man I so highly value, suspect my dispositions toward him. But as, after all, Mr. Addison must be the judge in what regards himself, and has seem'd to be no very just one to me; so, I must own to you, I expect nothing but civility from
<PB N="294" REF="328"/>
him, how much soever I wish for his friend∣ship. As for any offices of real kindness or ser∣vice which it is in his power to do me, I should be ashamed to receive them from any man who had no better opinion of my Morals, than to think me a Party-man: nor of my Temper, than to believe me capable of maligning, or en∣vying another's reputation as a poet. So I leave it to time to convince him as to both, to shew him the shallow depths of those half-witted creatures who mis-inform'd him, and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to imitate, and therefore asham'd to flatter. In a word, Mr. Addison is sure of my respect at all times, and of my real friendship whenever he shall think fit to know me for what I am.</P>
<P>For all that pass'd betwixt Dr. Swift and me, you know the whole (without reserve) of our correspondence. The engagements I had to him were such as the actual services he had done me, in relation to the subscription for Homer, obliged me to. I must have leave to be grateful to him, and to any one who serves me, let him be never so obnoxious to any par∣ty: nor did the Tory-party ever put me to the hardship of asking this leave, which is the greatest obligation I owe to it; and I expect no greater from the Whig-party than the same li∣berty

<P>I Lay hold of the opportunity given me by my Lord Duke of Shrewsbury, to assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection I have long born you, and the memory of so many agreeable conversations as we have pass'd together. I wish it were a compliment to say,
<PB N="301" REF="335"/>
such conversations as are not to be found on this side of the water: for the Spirit of dissension is gone forth among us: nor is it a wonder that Button's is no longer Button's, when old Eng∣land is no longer old England, that region of hospitality, society, and good humour. Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politics as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine sense, refin'd sense, and ex∣alted sense; but for use and happiness, give me a little common sense. I say this in regard to some gentlemen, profess'd Wits of our acquaint∣ance, who fancy they can make Poetry of con∣sequence at this time of day, in the midst of this raging fit of Politics. For, they tell me, the busy part of the nation are not more divid∣ed about Whig and Tory, than these idle fel∣lows of the feather about Mr. T*'s and my Translation. I (like the Tories) have the town in general, that is the mob, on my side; but it is usual with the smaller party to make up in industry what they want in number, and that is the case with the little Senate of Cato. However, if our principles be well consider'd, I must appear a brave Whig, and Mr. T. a rank Tory: I translated Homer for the public in general, he to gratify the inordinate desires of one man only. We have, it seems, a great Turk in poetry, who can never bear a brother
<PB N="302" REF="336"/>
on the throne; and has his mutes too, a sett of nodders, winkers, and whisperers, whose bu∣siness is to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new translator of Homer is the humblest slave he has, that is to say, his first Minister; let him receive the honours he gives me, but receive them with fear and trem∣bling; let him be proud of the approbation of his absolute Lord, I appeal to the people, as my rightful judges and masters; and if they are not inclined to condemn me, I fear no arbi∣trary high-flying proceeding from the small Court-faction at Button's. But after all I have said of this great man, there is no rupture be∣tween us. We are each of us so civil and ob∣liging, that neither thinks he is obliged: And I, for my part, treat with him, as we do with the Grand Monarch; who has too many great qualities not to be respected, though we know he watches any occasion to oppress us <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">We find here most of the sentiments he soon after put into verse on this occasion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>MEthinks when I write to you, I am mak∣ing a confession; I have got (I can't tell how) such a custom of throwing myself out upon paper without reserve. You were not mis∣taken in what you judged of my temper of mind when I writ last. My faults will not be hid from you, and perhaps it is no dispraise to me that they will not: the cleanness and pu∣rity of one's mind is never better proved, than in discovering its own fault at first view; as when a stream shews the dirt at its bottom, it shews also the transparency of the water.</P>
<P>My spleen was not occasioned, however, by any thing an abusive angry critic could write of me. I take very kindly your heroic manner

of congratulation upon this scandal; for I think nothing more honourable, than to be involved in the same fate with all the great and the good that ever lived; that is, to be envied and cen∣sured by bad writers.</P>
<P>You do no more than answer my expecta∣tions of you, in declaring how well you take my freedom, in sometimes neglecting, as I do, to reply to your letters so soon as I ought. Those who have a right taste of the substan∣tial part of friendship, can wave the ceremo∣nial: a friend is the only one that will bear the omission; and one may find who is not so, by the very trial of it.</P>
<P>As to any anxiety I have concerning the fate of my Homer, the care is over with me: the world must be the judge, and I shall be the first to consent to the justice of its judgment, whatever it be. I am not so arrant an Author as even to desire, that if I am in the wrong, all mankind should be so.</P>
<P>I am mightily pleas'd with a saying of Mon∣sieur Tourreil: <Q>“When a man writes, he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of pleas∣ing all the world: but he is to renounce that desire or hope, the very moment the book goes out of his hands.”</Q></P>

<P>THE Farce of the What-d'ye-call-it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Written by Gay.</NOTE> has occasioned many different speculations in the town. Some look'd upon it as a mere jest upon the Tragic poets, others as a satire upon the late War. Mr. Cromwell, hearing none of the words, and seeing the action to be tragical, was much astonished to find the audience laugh;
<PB N="306" REF="340"/>
and says the Prince and Princess must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same ac∣count. Several templars and others of the more vociferous kind of critics, went with a resolu∣tion to hiss, and confess'd they were forced to laugh so much, that they forgot the design they came with. The Court in general has in a very particular manner come into the jest, and the three first nights (notwithstanding two of them were court-nights) were distinguished by very full audiences of the first Quality. The com∣mon people of the pit and gallery received it at first with great gravity and sedateness, some few with tears; but after the third day they also took the hint, and have ever since been very loud in their claps. There are still some sober men who cannot be of the general opinion; but the laughers are so much the majority, that one or two critics seem determined to undeceive the town at their proper cost, by writing grave dissertations against it: to encourage them in which laudable design, it is resolved a Preface shall be prefix'd to the Farce, in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writ∣ing.</P>
<P>Yesterday Mr. Steele's affair was decided: I am sorry I can be of no other opinion than yours, as to his whole carriage and writings of late. But certainly he has not only been punished by
<PB N="307" REF="341"/>
others, but suffered much even from his own party in the point of character, nor (I believe) received any amends in that of interest, as yet, whatever may be his prospects for the future.</P>

There is a grand revolution at Will's; Morice has quitted for a coffee-house in the city, and Titcomb is restored, to the great joy of Cromwell, who was at a great loss for a person to converse with upon the fathers and church-history; the
<PB N="308" REF="342"/>

Mr. Rowe's Jane Gray is to be play'd in Easter-week, when Mrs. Oldfield is to person∣ate a character directly opposite to female na∣ture; for what woman ever despised Sove∣reignty? You know Chaucer has a tale where a knight saves his head, by discovering it was the thing which all women most coveted. Mr. Pope's Homer is retarded by the great rains that have fallen of late, which causes the sheets to be long a drying: this gives Mr. Lintot great uneasiness, who is now endeavouring to cor∣rupt the Curate of his parish to pray for fair weather, that his work may go on. There is a six-penny Criticism lately published upon the tragedy of the What-d'ye-call it, wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead, and Mr. Pope a knave. His grand charge is against the Pilgrim's Progress being read, which, he says, is directly levell'd at Cato's reading Plato; to back this censure, he goes on to tell you, that the Pilgrim's Progress being mentioned to be the eighth edition, makes the
<PB N="309" REF="343"/>
reflection evident, the Tragedy of Cato having just eight times (as he quaintly expresses it) vi∣sited the press. He has also endeavoured to show, that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of tragedy, which, he says, I have injudiciously and profanely abused <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This curious piece was entituled, A compleat Key to the What-d'ye-call it, written by one Griffin a Player, assisted by Lewis Theobald. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>.

I fear I must get the gout by drinking; purely for a fashionable pretence to sit still long enough to translate four books of Homer. I hope you'll by that time be up again, and I may succeed to the bed and couch of my predecessor: pray cause the stuffing to be repaired, and the crutches shorten'd for me. The calamity of your gout is what all your friends, that is to say, all that know you, must share in; we desire you in your turn to condole

<P>AS I take ingratitude to be a greater crime than impertinence, I chuse rather to run the risque of being thought guilty of the lat∣ter, than not to return you my thanks for a very agreeable entertainment you just now gave me. I have accidentally met with your Rape of the Lock here, having never seen it before. Style, painting, judgment, spirit, I had already admired in other of your writings; but in this I am charm'd with the magic of your inven∣tion, with all those images, allusions, and in∣explicable
<PB N="314" REF="348"/>
beauties, which you raise so surpris∣ingly, and at the same time so naturally, out of a trifle. And yet I cannot say that I was more pleas'd with the reading of it, than I am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts, the remembrance of one who values no happiness beyond the friendship of men of wit, learning, and good-nature.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard you mention some half-form'd design of coming to Italy. What might we not expect from a Muse that sings so well in the bleak climate of England, if she felt the same warm sun and breathed the same air with Virgil and Horace?</P>
<P>There are here an incredible number of Poets, that have all the inclination, but want the genius, or perhaps the art, of the An∣cients. Some among them, who understand English, begin to relish our Authors; and I am informed, that at Florence they have translated Milton into Italian verse. If one who knows so well how to write like the old Latin poets, came among them; it would pro∣bably be a means to retrieve them from their cold, trivial conceits, to an imitation of their predecessors.</P>
<P>As merchants, antiquaries, men of pleasure, &amp;c. have all different views in travelling; I know not whether it might not be worth a
<PB N="315" REF="349"/>
Poet's while, to travel, in order to store his mind with strong images of Nature.</P>
<P>Green fields and groves, flowery meadows and purling streams are no where in such per∣fection as in England: but if you would know lightsome days, warm suns, and blue skies, you must come to Italy: and to enable a man to de∣scribe rocks and precipices, it is absolutely ne∣cessary that he pass the Alps.</P>
<P>You will easily perceive that it is self-inter∣est makes me so fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it. If you came into these parts I should fly to see you. I am here (by the favour of my good friend the Dean of St. Patrick's) in quality of Chaplain to the Earl of Peterborough; who about three months since left the greatest part of his family in this town. God knows how long we shall stay here.</P>

<P>THO', as you rightly remark, I pay my tax but once in half a year, yet you shall see by this letter upon the neck of my last, that
<PB N="316" REF="350"/>
I pay a double tax, as we non-jurors ought to do. Your acquaintance on this side of the sea are under terrible apprehensions from your long stay in Ireland, that you may grow too polite for them; for we think (since the great success of such a play as the Non-juror) that polite∣ness is gone over the water. But others are of opinion it has been longer among you, and was introduced much about the same time with Frogs, and with equal success. Poor Poetry! the little that is left of it here longs to cross the seas, and leave Eusden in full and peaceable possession of the British laurel: and we begin to wish you had the singing of our poets, as well as the croaking of our frogs, to yourselves, <HI>in saecula saeculorum.</HI> It would be well in ex∣change, if Parnelle, and two or three more of your Swans would come hither, especially that Swan, who, like a true modern one, does not sing at all, Dr. Swift. I am (like the rest of the world) a sufferer by his idleness. Indeed I hate that any man should be idle, while I must translate and comment; and I may the more sincerely wish for good poetry from others because I am become a person out of the que∣stion; for a Translator is no more a poet, than a Taylor is a man.</P>
<P>You are, doubtless, persuaded of the validity of that famous verse,
<Q><PB N="317" REF="351"/>
<L>'Tis Expectation makes a Blessing dear:</L></Q>
but why would you make your friends fonder of you than they are? There is no manner of need of it. We begin to expect you no more than Anti-christ; a man that hath absented himself so long from his friends, ought to be put into the Gazettee.</P>
<P>Every body here has great need of you. Many faces have died for want of your pencil, and blooming Ladies have wither'd in expect∣ing your return. Even Frank and Betty (that constant pair) cannot console themselves for your absence; I fancy they will be forced to make their own picture in a pretty babe, before you come home: 'twill be a noble subject for a fa∣mily piece. Come then, and having peopled Ireland with a world of beautiful shadows, come to us, and see with that eye (which, like the eye of the world, creates beauties by look∣ing on them) see, I say, how England has al∣ter'd the airs of all its heads in your absence: and with what sneaking city attitudes our most celebrated personages appear, in the mere mor∣tal works of our painters.</P>
<P>Mr. Fortescue is much yours; Gay comme∣morates you; and lastly (to climb by just steps and degrees) my Lord Burlington desires you may be put in mind of him. His gardens flou∣rish,
<PB N="318" REF="352"/>
his structures rise, his pictures arrive, and (what is far more valuable than all) his own good qualities daily extend themselves to all about him: of whom I the meanest (next, to some Italian Fidlers, and English Bricklayers) am a living instance.</P>

<P>IF I had not done my utmost to lead my life so pleasantly as to forget all misfortunes, I should tell you I reckoned your absence no small one; but I hope you have also had many good and pleasant reasons to forget your friends on this side the world. If a wish could transport me to you and your present companions, I could do the same. Dr. Swift, I believe, is a very good landlord, and a chearful host at his own table: I suppose he has perfectly learnt him∣self, what he has taught so many others, <HI>rupta non insanire lagena:</HI> else he would not make a proper host for your humble servant, who (you know) tho' he drinks a glass as seldom as any man, contrives to break one as often. But 'tis a consolation to me, that I can do this, and many other enormities, under my own roof.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="353"/>
But that you and I are upon equal terms, in all friendly laziness, and have taken an invio∣lable oath to each other, always to do what we will; I should reproach you for so long a silence. The best amends you can make for saying no∣thing to me, is by saying all the good you can of me, which is, that I heartily love and esteem the Dean and Dr. Parnelle.</P>
<P>Gay is yours and theirs. His spirit is awak∣ened very much in the cause of the Dean, which has broke forth in a courageous cou∣plet or two upon Sir Richard Blackmore: He has printed it with his name to it, and bravely assigns no other reason, than that the said Sir Richard has abused Dr. Swift. I have also suffered in the like cause, and shall suffer more: unless Parnelle sends me his Zoilus and Book∣worm (which the Bishop of Clogher, I hear, greatly extols) it will be shortly, <HI>concurrere Bellum atque Virum</HI>—I love you all, as much as I despise most wits in this dull country. Ire∣land has turned the tables upon England; and if I have no poetical friend in my own nation, I'll be as proud as Scipio, and say (since I am reduced to skin and bone) <HI>Ingrata patria, ne</HI> ossa <HI>quidem habeas.</HI></P>

<P>THAT you have not heard from me of late, ascribe not to the usual laziness of your correspondent, but to a ramble to Oxford, where your name is mentioned with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of Doctor Clarke: He entertain'd me with se∣veral drawings, and particularly with the origi∣nal designs of Inigo Jones's Whitehall. I there saw and reverenced some of your first pieces; which future painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the Culex of Virgil and Batrachom. of Homer.</P>
<P>Having named this latter piece, give me leave to ask what is become of Dr. Parnelle and his Frogs <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He translated the Batrachom. of Homer, which is printed amongst his Poems.</NOTE>? <HI>Oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus et illis,</HI> might be Horace's wish, but will never be mine while I have such <HI>meorums</HI> as Dr. Parnelle and Dr. Swift. I hope the Spring will restore you to us, and with you all the beauties and colours of nature. Not but I congratulate you
<PB N="321" REF="355"/>
on the pleasure you must take in being admir'd in your own country, which so seldom hap∣pens to Prophets and Poets: but in this you have the advantage of Poets; you are master of an art that must prosper and grow rich, as long as people love, or are proud of themselves, or their own persons. However, you have stay'd long enough, methinks, to have painted all the numberless Histories of old Ogygia. If you have begun to be historical, I recommend to your hand the story which every pious Irish∣man ought to begin with, that of St. Patrick; to the end you may be obliged (as Dr. P. was, when he translated the Batrachomuomachia) to come into England, to copy the Frogs, and such other vermine as were never seen in that land since the time of that Confessor.</P>
<P>I long to see you a History painter. You have already done enough for the private, do something for the public; and be not con∣fined, like the rest, to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us. The An∣cients too expect you should do them right; those Statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the account you intend to write of their Characters. I hope
<PB N="322" REF="356"/>
you think more warmly than ever of that de∣sign <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope used to say he had had an acquaintance with three eminent Painters, none of which had common sense. Instead of valuing themselves on their perform∣ances in that art, where they all had merit; the one was deep in military Architec∣ture, without a line of Ma∣thematics; the other in the doctrine of Fate, without a principle of Philosophy; and the third in the translation of Don Quixote without a word of Spanish.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to your enquiry about your house, when I come within the walls, they put me in mind of those of Carthage, where your friend, like the wandring Trojan,
<Q><L>animum Pictura pascit inani.</L></Q>
For the spacious mansion, like a Turkish Ca∣ravanserah, entertains the vagabonds with only bare lodging. I rule the family very ill, keep bad hours, and lend out your pictures about the town. See what it is to have a poet in your house! Frank indeed does all he can in such a circumstance; for, considering he has a wild beast in it, he constantly keeps the door chain'd: Every time it is open'd, the links rattle, the rusty hinges roar. The house seems so sensible that you are its support, that it is ready to drop in your absence; but I still trust myself under its roof, as depending that Providence will pre∣serve so many Raphael's, Titian's, and Guido's, as are lodged in your Cabinet. Surely the sins
<PB N="323" REF="357"/>
of one Poet can hardly be so heavy, as to bring an old house over the heads of so many Paint∣ers. In a word, your house is falling; but what of that? I am only a lodger <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the story of the Irishman.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>LAST post brought me the favour of your letter of the 10th Aug. O. S. It would be taking too much upon me to decide, that it was a witty one; I never pretend to more judgment than to know what pleases me, and can assure you, it was a very agreeable one. The proof I can give you of my sincerity in this opinion, is, that I hope and desire you would not stop at this, but continue more of them.</P>
<P>I am in a place where pleasure is continually flowing. The Princes set the example, and the subjects follow at a distance. The Ladies are of all parties <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> In all companies.</NOTE>, by which means the conver∣sation of the men is very much softened and fashioned from those blunt disputes on Politics, and rough jests, we are so guilty of; while the
<PB N="324" REF="358"/>
freedom of the women takes away all forma∣lity and constraint. I must own, at the same time, these Beauties are a little too artificial for my taste: you have seen a French picture, the Original is more painted, and such a crust of powder and essence in their hair, that you can see no difference between black and red. By disusing Stays and indulging themselves at table, they run out of all shape; but as to that, they may give a good reason, they prefer Con∣veniency to Parade, and are, by this means, as ready, as they are generally willing, to be cha∣ritable.</P>
<P>I am surpriz'd to find I have wrote so much scandal; I fancy I am either setting up for a wit, or imagine I must write in this style to a wit; I hope you'll prove a good-natur'd one, and not only let me hear from you sometimes, but forgive the small encouragement you meet with. I won't trouble myself to finish finely; a true compliment is better than a good one, and I can assure you without any, that I am very sincerely,</P>

<P>I Had not omitted answering yours of the 18th of last month, but out of a desire to give you some certain and satisfactory account, which way, and at what time, you might take your journey. I am now commissioned to tell you, that Mr. Craggs will expect you on the rising of the Parliament, which will be as soon as he can receive you in the manner he would receive a man <HI>de belles Lettres,</HI> that is, in tranquillity and full leisure. I dare say your way of life (which, in my taste, will be the best in the world, and with one of the best men in the world) must prove highly to your contentment. And, I must add, it will be still the more a joy to me, as I shall reap a peculiar advantage from the good I shall have done in bringing you to∣gether <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr Craggs had had no learned education: he want∣ed to improve himself in knowledge of that kind, and desired Mr. Pope to chuse him out a polite scholar, by whose conversation and in∣struction he might improve himself in letters. Mr. Pope recommended Mr. Fenton: but Mr Craggs' untimely death prevented both from receiving the benefits of this connexion.</NOTE>, by seeing it in my own neighbour∣hood.
<PB N="326" REF="360"/>
Mr. Craggs has taken a house close by mine, whither he proposes to come in three weeks: In the mean time I heartily invite you to live with me; where a frugal and philoso∣phical diet, for a time, may give you a higher relish of that elegant way of life you will enter into after. I desire to know by the first post how soon I may hope for you?</P>
<P>I am a little scandalized at your complaint that your time lies heavy on your hands, when the Muses have put so many good materials in∣to your head to employ them. As to your question, What I am doing? I answer, Just what I have been doing some years, my duty; se∣condly, relieving myself with necessary amuse∣ments, or exercises, which shall serve me in∣stead of physic as long as they can; thirdly, reading till I am tired; and lastly, writing when I have no other thing in the world to do, or no friend to entertain in company.</P>
<P>My mother is, I thank God, the easier, if not the better, for my cares; and I am the hap∣pier in that regard, as well as in the conscious∣ness of doing my best. My next felicity is in retaining the good opinion of honest men, who think me not quite undeserving of it; and in finding no injuries from others hurt me, as long as I know myself. I will add the sincerity with which I act towards ingenious and unde∣signing

<OPENER><DATELINE>Naples, <DATE>Oct. 22. N. S. 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a letter, but was discouraged for want of something that I could think worth sending fifteen hundred miles. Italy is such an exhausted subject, that, I dare say, you'd easily forgive my saying nothing of it; and the ima∣gination of a Poet is a thing so nice and deli∣cate, that it is no easy matter to find out images capable of giving pleasure to one of the few, who (in any age) have come up to that cha∣racter. I am nevertheless lately returned from an island, where I passed three or four months; which, were it set out in its true colours, might, methinks, amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The island Inarime is an epi∣tome
<PB N="328" REF="362"/>
of the whole earth, containing within the compass of eighteen miles, a wonderful variety of hills, vales, ragged rocks, fruitful plains, and barren mountains, all thrown together in a most romantic confusion. The air is in the hottest season constantly refreshed by cool breezes from the sea. The vales produce ex∣cellent wheat and Indian corn, but are mostly covered with vineyards, intermix'd with fruit∣trees. Besides the common kinds, as cherries, apricots, peaches, &amp;c. they produce oranges, limes, almonds, pomegranates, figs, water∣melons, and many other fruits unknown to our climates, which lie every where open to the passenger. The hills are the greater part co∣vered to the top with vines, some with chesnut groves, and others with thickets of myrtle and lentiscus. The fields in the northern side are divided by hedge-rows of myrtle. Several fountains and rivulets add to the beauty of this landscape, which is likewise set off by the va∣riety of some barren spots, and naked rocks. But that which crowns the scene, is a large mountain, rising out of the middle of the island (once a terrible Volcano, by the ancients called Mons Epomeus) its lower parts are adorned with vines, and other fruits; the middle affords pasture to flocks of goats and sheep; and the top is a sandy pointed rock, from which you
<PB N="329" REF="363"/>
have the finest prospect in the world, surveying at one view, besides several pleasant islands ly∣ing at your feet, a tract of Italy about three hun∣dred miles in length, from the promontory of Antium to the cape of Palinurus: the greater part of which hath been sung by Homer and Virgil, as making a considerable part of the travels and adventures of their two Heroes. The Islands Caprea, Prochyta, and Parthenope, to∣gether with Cajeta, Cumae, Monte Miseno, the habitations of Circe, the Syrens, and the Lae∣strigones, the bay of Naples, the promontory of Minerva, and the whole Campagnia felice, make but a part of this noble landscape; which would demand an imagination as warm, and numbers as flowing as your own, to describe it. The inhabitants of this delicious isle, as they are without riches and honours, so are they without the vices and follies that attend them; and were they but as much strangers to re∣venge, as they are to avarice and ambition, they might in fact answer the poetical notions of the golden age. But they have got, as an alloy to their happiness, an ill habit of murdering one another on slight offences. We had an instance of this the second night after our arrival, a youth of eighteen being shot dead by our door: and yet by the sole secret of minding our own busi∣ness, we found a means of living securely among
<PB N="330" REF="364"/>
these dangerous people. Would you know how we pass the time at Naples? Our chief enter∣tainment is the devotion of our neighbours: besides the gaiety of their Churches (where folks go to see what they call <HI>una bella Devo∣tione</HI> (i. e.) a sort of religious opera) they make fireworks almost every week, out of de∣votion; the streets are often hung with arras, out of devotion; and (what is still more strange) the ladies invite gentlemen to their houses and treat them with music and sweatmeats, out of devotion; in a word, were it not for this devo∣tion of its inhabitants, Naples would have little else to recommend it, beside the air and situa∣tion. Learning is in no very thriving state here, as indeed no where else in Italy; however, among many pretenders, some men of taste are to be met with. A friend of mine told me not long since, that, being to visit Salvini at Flo∣rence, he found him reading your Homer: he liked the notes extremely, and could find no other fault with the version, but that he thought it approached too near a paraphrase; which shews him not to be sufficiently acquainted with our language. I wish you health to go on with that noble work, and when you have that, I need not wish you success.

I begin to fear you'll die in Ireland, and that Denunciation will be fulfilled upon you, <HI>Hibernus es, et in Hiberniam rever∣teris.</HI> I should be apt to think you in Sancho's case; some Duke has made you Governor of an island, or wet place, and you are admini∣string laws to the wild Irish. But I must own, when you talk of Building and Planting, you touch my string; and I am as apt to pardon you, as the fellow that thought himself Jupiter would have pardon'd the other madman who call'd himself his brother Neptune. Alas, Sir, do you know whom you talk to? one that has
<PB N="332" REF="366"/>
been a Poet, was degraded to a Translator, and at last, thro' mere dulness, is turned an Archi∣tect. You know Martial's censure, <HI>Praeconem facito vel Architectum.</HI> However, I have one way left, to plan, to elevate, and to surprize, (as Bays says) the next news you may expect to hear, is that I am in debt.</P>
<P>The history of my Transplantation and set∣tlement which you desire, would require a volume, were I to enumerate the many pro∣jects, difficulties, vicissitudes, and various fates attending that important part of my life: much more, should I describe the many Draughts, Elevations, Profiles, Perspectives, &amp;c. of every Palace and Garden propos'd, intended, and happily raised, by the strength of that facul∣ty wherein all great Genius's excel, Imagina∣tion. At last, the Gods and fate have fix'd me on the borders of the Thames, in the districts of Richmond and Twickenham: It is here I have pass'd an entire year of my life, without any fix'd abode in London, or more than casting a transitory glance (for a day or two at most in a month) on the pomps of the Town. It is here I hope to receive you, Sir, returned from eternizing the Ireland of this age. For you my structures rise; for you my Colonades extend their wings; for you my groves aspire, and roses bloom. And, to say truth, I hope posterity
<PB N="333" REF="367"/>
(which, no doubt, will be made acquainted with all these things) will look upon it as one of the principal motives of my Architecture, that it was a mansion prepar'd to receive you, against your own should fall to dust, which is destin'd to be the tomb of poor Frank and Betty, and the immortal monument of the Fidelity of two such Servants, who have excell'd in constancy the very Rats of your family.</P>
<P>What more can I tell you of myself? so much, and yet all put together so little, that I scarce care or know, how to do it. But the very reasons that are against putting it upon pa∣per, are as strong for telling it you in person; and I am uneasy to be so long denied the satis∣faction of it.</P>

I'd fain know if he be buried at Chester, or Dublin; and what care has been, or is to be taken for his Monu∣ment, &amp;c. Yet I have not neglected my devoirs to Mr. Rowe; I am writing this very day his Epitaph for Westminster-Abbey—After these, the best natur'd of Men, Sir Samuel Garth, has left me in the truest concern for his loss. His death was very heroical, and yet unaffected enough to have made a Saint or a Philosopher famous. But ill tongues, and worse hearts have branded even his last moments, as wrong∣fully as they did his life, with Irreligion.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your Mare could speak, she would give an account of what extraordinary company she had on the road; which since she cannot do, I will.</P>
<P>It was the enterprizing Mr. Lintott, the re∣doubtable rival of Mr. Tonson, who, mounted on a stone-horse (no disagreeable companion to
<PB N="337" REF="371"/>
your Lordship's mare) overtook me in Wind∣sor-forest. He said, he heard I design'd for Oxford, the seat of the Muses, and would, as my bookseller, by all means, accompany me thither.</P>
<P>I ask'd him where he got his horse? He an∣swer'd, he got if of his Publisher: <Q>“”For that rogue my Printer (said he) disappointed me: I hoped to put him in good-humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown fricassee of rabbits, which cost two shillings, with two quarts of wine, besides my conversation. I thought myself cocksure of his horse, which he readily promis'd me, but said that Mr. Tonson had just such another design of going to Cambridge, expecting there the copy of a new kind of Horace from Dr.—, and if Mr. Tonson went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the said copy.</Q></P>
<Q>“So in short, I borrow'd this stonehorse of my publisher, which he had of Mr. Oldmixon for a debt; he lent me too the pretty boy you see after me: he was a smutty dog yesterday, and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face; but the Devil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his Catechise: if you have any more baggs, he shall carry them.”</Q>
<P><PB N="338" REF="372"/>
I thought Mr. Lintot's civility not to be neg∣lected, so gave the boy a small bag, containing three shirts and an Elzevir Virgil; and mount∣ing in an instant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid devil behind.</P>
<P>Mr. Lintot began in this manner. <Q>“Now damn them! what if they should put it into the news-paper, how you and I went toge∣ther to Oxford? what would I care? If I should go down into Sussex, they would say I was gone to the Speaker. But what of that? If my son were but big enough to go on with the business, by G—d I would keep as good company as old Jacob.”</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon I enquir'd of his son. <Q>“The lad (says he) has fine parts, but is somewhat sick∣ly, much as you are—I spare for nothing in his Education at Westminster. Pray, don't you think Westminster to be the best school in England? most of the late Ministry came out of it, so did many of this Ministry; I hope the boy will make his fortune.”</Q></P>
<P>Don't you design to let him pass a year at Oxford? <Q>“To what purpose? (said he) the Universities do but make Pedants, and I in∣tend to breed him a man of business.”</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. Lintot was talking, I observ'd he sate uneasy on his saddle, for which I express'd
<PB N="339" REF="373"/>
some sollicitude: Nothing, says he, I can bear it well enough; but since we have the day be∣fore us, methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest a-while under the woods. When we were alighted, <Q>“See here, what a mighty pretty Horace I have in my pocket! what if you amus'd yourself in turning an ode, till we mount again? Lord! if you pleas'd, what a clever Miscellany might you make at leisure hours?”</Q> Perhaps I may, said I, if we ride on; the motion is an aid to my fancy, a round trott very much awakens my spirits: then jog on a pace, and I'll think as hard as I can.</P>
<P>Silence ensued for a full hour; after which Mr. Lintot lugg'd the reins, stop'd short, and broke out, <Q>“Well, Sir, how far have you gone? I answer'd, Seven miles. Z—ds, Sir, said Lintot, I thought you had done seven stan∣za's. Oldsworth, in a ramble round Wimble∣ton-hill, would translate a whole ode in half this time. I'll say that for Oldsworth (tho' I lost by his Timothy's) he translates an ode of Horace the quickest of any man in Eng∣land. I remember Dr. King would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could not speak: and there's Sir Richard, in that rumbling old chariot of his, between Fleet∣ditch and St. Giles's pound, shall make you half a Job.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="374"/>
Pray, Mr. Lintot (said I) now you talk of Translators, what is your method of managing them? <Q>“Sir (reply'd he) those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world: in a hungry fit, they'll swear they understand all the lan∣guages in the universe: I have known one of them take down a Greek book upon my counter and cry, Ay, this is Hebrew, I must read it from the latter end. By G—d I can never be sure in these fellows, for I neither understand Greek, Latin, French, nor Italian myself. But this is my way; I agree with them for ten shillings per sheet, with a pro∣viso, that I will have their doings corrected by whom I please; so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author; my judgment giving the negative to all my translators.”</Q> But how are you secure those correctors may not impose upon you? <Q>“”Why I get any civil gentleman, (especially any Scotchman) that comes into my shop, to read the original to me in English; by this I know whether my first translator be defi∣cient, and whether my corrector merits his money or not?</Q></P>
<Q>“I'll tell you what happen'd to me last month: I bargain'd with S* for a new ver∣sion of Lucretius to publish against Tonson's; agreeing to pay the author so many shillings
<PB N="341" REF="375"/>
at his producing so many lines. He made a great progress in a very short time, and I gave it to the corrector to compare with the Latin; but he went directly to Creech's trans∣lation, and found it the same word for word, all but the first page. Now, what d'ye think I did? I arrested the translator for a cheat; nay, and I stopt the corrector's pay too, upon this proof that he had made use of Creech instead of the original.”</Q>
<P>Pray tell me next how you deal with the Critics? <Q>“”Sir (said he) nothing more easy. I can silence the most formidable of them: the rich ones for a sheet a piece of the blotted ma∣nuscript, which costs me nothing; they'll go about with it to their acquaintance, and pretend they had it from the author, who submitted to their correction: this has given some of them such an air, that in time they come to be consulted with, and dedicated to, as the top Critics of the town.—As for the poor critics, I'll give you one instance of my management, by which you may guess at the rest. A lean man, that look'd like a very good scholar, came to me t'other day; he turn'd over your Homer, shook his head, shrug'd up his shoulders, and pish'd at every line of it: One would wonder (says he) at the strange presumption of some men; Ho∣mer
<PB N="342" REF="376"/>
is no such easy task, that every stripling, every versifier—He was going on, when my wife call'd to dinner: Sir, said I, will you please to eat a piece of beef with me? Mr. Lintot, said he, I am sorry you should be at the expence of this great book, I am really concern'd on your account—Sir, I am much obliged to you: if you can dine upon a piece of beef, together with a slice of pud∣ding—Mr. Lintot, I do not say but Mr. Pope, if he would condescend to advise with men of learning—Sir, the pudding is upon the table, if you please to go in—My critic complies, he comes to a taste of your poetry, and tells me in the same breath, that the book is commendable, and the pudding ex∣cellent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Now, Sir, (concluded Mr. Lintot) in return to the frankness I have shewn, pray tell me, Is it the opinion of your friends at court that my Lord Lansdown will be brought to the bar or not?”</Q> I told him I heard he would not, and I hop'd it, my Lord being one I had particular obligations to. <Q>“That may be (re∣ply'd Mr. Lintot) but by G-d if he is not, I shall lose the printing of a very good Trial.”</Q></P>
<P>These, my Lord, are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of Mr. Lintot,
<PB N="343" REF="377"/>
which I have chosen for the subject of a letter. I dropt him as soon as I got to Oxford, and paid a visit to my Lord Carleton at Middleton.</P>
<P>The conversations I enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen, and the pleasures from them only to be equal'd when I meet your Lordship. I hope in a few days to cast myself from your horse at your feet.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(In answer to a Letter in which he inclosed the De∣scription of Buckingham-house, written by him to the D. of Sh.)</HEAD>
<P>PLINY was one of those few author, who had a warm house over his heads nay two houses, as appears by two of his epi∣stles. I believe, if any of his contemporary authors durst have inform'd the public where they lodged, we should have found the gar∣rets of Rome as well inhabited, as those of Fleet-street; but 'tis dangerous to let creditors into such a secret, therefore we may presume that then, as well as now-a-days, no body knew where they lived but their Booksellers.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="378"/>
It seems, that when Virgil came to Rome, he had no lodging at all: he first introduc'd himself to Augustus by an epigram, beginning <HI>Nocte pluit tota</HI>—an observation which proba∣bly he had not made, unless he had lain all night in the street.</P>
<P>Where Juvenal lived we cannot affirm; but in one of his satyrs he complains of the exces∣sive price of lodgings; neither do I believe he would have talk'd so feelingly of Codrus's bed, if there had been room for a bedfellow in it.</P>
<P>I believe, with all the ostentation of Pliny, he would have been glad to have changed both his houses for your Grace's one; which is a country-house in the summer, and a town-house in the winter, and must be owned to be the pro∣perest habitation for a wise man, who sees all the world change every season without ever changing himself.</P>
<P>I have been reading the description of Pli∣ny's house with an eye to yours, but, finding they will bear no comparison, will try if it can be matched by the large country seat I inhabit at present, and see what figure it may make by the help of a florid description.</P>
<P>You must expect nothing regular in my de∣scription, any more than in the house; the whole vast edifice is so disjointed, and the several
<PB N="345" REF="379"/>
parts of it so detach'd one from the other, and yet so joining again, one cannot tell how, that, in one of my poetical fits, I imagined it had been a village in Amphion's time, where the cottages having taken a country dance together, had been all out, and stood stone-still with amazement ever since.</P>
<P>You must excuse me, if I say nothing of the Front; indeed I don't know which it is. A stranger would be grievously disappointed, who endeavour'd to get into this house the right way. One would reasonably expect after the entry through the Porch to be let into the hall: alas nothing less! you find yourself in the house of office. From the parlour you think to step into the drawing-room, but upon opening the iron∣nail'd door, you are convinced by a flight of birds about your ears, and a cloud of dust in your eyes, that it is the Pigeon-house. If you come into the chapel, you find its altars, like those of the Ancients, continually smoak∣ing, but it is with the steams of the adjoining kitchin.</P>
<P>The great hall within is high and spacious, flank'd on one side with a very long table, a true image of ancient hospitality: the walls are all over ornamented with monstrous horns of animals, about twenty broken pikes, ten or a dozen blunderbusses, and a rusty matchlock
<PB N="346" REF="380"/>
musquet or two, which we were inform'd had serv'd in the civil wars. Here is one vast arch'd window beautifully darken'd with divers scut∣cheons of painted glass: one shining pane in particular bears date 1286, which alone pre∣serves the memory of a Knight whose iron ar∣mour is long since perished with rust, and whose alabaster nose is moulder'd from his monument. The face of dame Eleanor in another piece owes more to that single pane than to all the glasses she ever consulted in her life. After this, who can say that glass is frail, when it is not half so frail as human beauty, or glory! and yet I can't but sigh to think that the most authentic record of so ancient a family should lie at the mercy of every infant who flings a stone. In former days there have dined in this hall gar∣ter'd Knights, and courtly Dames, attended by ushers, sewers, and seneschals; and yet it was but last night, that an owl flew hither and mis∣took it for a barn.</P>
<P>This hall lets you (up and down) over a very high threshold into the great parlour. Its con∣tents are a broken-belly'd virginal, a couple of cripled velvet chairs, with two or three mill∣dew'd pictures of mouldy ancestors, who look as dismally as if they came fresh from hell with all their brimstone about them; these are care∣fully set at the farther corner, for the windows
<PB N="347" REF="381"/>
being every where broken make it so convenient a place to dry poppies and mustard seed, that the room is appropriated to that use.</P>
<P>Next this parlour, as I said before, lies the pigeon-house, by the side of which runs an en∣try, which lets you on one hand and t'other in∣to a bed-chamber, a buttery, and a small hole call'd the chaplain's study: then follow a brew∣house, a little green and gilt parlour, and the great stairs, under which is the dairy; a little farther on the right the servants hall, and by the side of it up six steps, the old lady's closet for her private devotions; which has a lettice into the hall, intended (as we imagine) that at same time as she pray'd, she might have an eye on the men and maids. There are upon the ground-floor in all twenty six apartments, among which I must not forget a chamber which has in it a large Antiquity of timber, that seems to have been either a bedstead, or a cy∣der-press.</P>
<P>The kitchen is built in form of the Rotunda, being one vast vault to the top of the House; where one overture serves to let out the smoke, and let in the light. By the blackness of the walls, the circular fires, vast cauldrons, yawn∣ing mouths of ovens and furnaces, you would think it either the forge of Vulcan, the cave of Polypheme, or the temple of Moloch. The
<PB N="348" REF="382"/>
horror of this place has made such an impres∣sion on the country people, that they believe the Witches keep their Sabbath here, and that once a year the Devil treats them with infernal venison, a roasted Tiger stuff'd with ten-penny nails.</P>
<P>Above stairs we have a number of rooms: you never pass out of one into another but by the ascent or descent of two or three stairs. Our best room is very long and low, of the exact proportion of a Band-box. In most of these rooms there are hangings of the finest work in the world, that is to say, those which Arachne spins from her own bowels. Were it not for this only furniture, the whole would be a miserable scene of naked walls, flaw'd cielings, broken windows, and rusty locks. The roof is so de∣cay'd, that after a favourable shower we may expect a crop of mushrooms between the chinks of our floors. All the doors are as little and low as those to the cabbins of Packet-boats. These rooms have for many years had no other inha∣bitants than certain rats, whose very age renders them worthy of this Seat, for the very rats of this venerable house are grey: since these have not yet quitted it, we hope at least that this an∣cient mansion may not fall during the small remnant these poor animals have to live, who are now too infirm to remove to another. There
<PB N="349" REF="383"/>
is yet a small subsistance left them in the few remaining books of the Library.</P>
<P>We had never seen half what I had described, but for a starch'd grey-headed Steward, who is as much an antiquity as any in this place, and looks like an old family picture walked out of its frame. He entertain'd us as we pass'd from room to room with several relations of the fa∣mily; but his observations were particularly cu∣rious when we came to the cellar: he inform∣ed us where stood the triple rows of buts of sack, and where were ranged the bottles of tent, for toasts in a morning; he pointed to the stands that supported the iron-hoop'd hogsheads of strong beer; then stepping to a corner, he lugg'd out the tatter'd fragments of an unframed pic∣ture; <Q>“This (says he, with tears) was poor Sir Thomas! once master of all this drink. He had two sons, poor young masters! who ne∣ver arrived to the age of his beer; they both fell ill in this very room, and never went out on their own legs.”</Q> He could not pass by a heap of broken bottles without taking up a piece, to show us the Arms of the family upon it. He then led us up the Tower by dark wind∣ing stone steps, which landed us into several lit∣tle rooms one above another. One of these was nail'd up, and our guide whisper'd to us as a secret the occasion of it: It seems the course of
<PB N="350" REF="384"/>
this noble blood was a little interrupted about two centuries ago, by a freak of the lady Frances, who was here taken in the fact with a neigh∣bouring Prior, ever since which the room has been nailed up, and branded with the name of the Adultery-Chamber. The ghost of lady Frances is supposed to walk there, and some prying maids of the family report that they have seen a lady in a fardingale through the key-hole; but this matter is husht up, and the servants are forbid to talk of it.</P>
<P>I must needs have tired you by this long de∣scription: but what engaged me in it, was a generous principle to preserve the memory of that, which itself must soon fall into dust, nay perhaps part of it, before this letter reaches your hands.</P>
<P>Indeed we owe this old house the same kind of gratitude that we do to an old friend, who harbours us in his declining condition, nay even in his last extremities. How fit is this retreat for uninterrupted study, where no one that passes by can dream there is an inhabitant, and even those who would dine with us dare not stay under our roof! Any one that sees it will own I could not have chosen a more likely place to con∣verse with the dead in. I had been mad indeed if I had left your Grace for any one but Homer. But when I return to the living, I shall have
<PB N="351" REF="385"/>
the sense to endeavour to converse with the best of them, and shall therefore as soon as possible tell you in person how much I am, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The D. of BUCKINGHAM to Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>YOU desire my opinion as to the late dis∣pute in France concerning Homer: And I think it excusable (at an age alas! of not much pleasure) to amuse myself a little in taking no∣tice of a controversy, than which nothing is at present more remarkable (even in a nation who value themselves so much upon the Belles Let∣tres) both on account of the illustrious subject of it, and of the two persons, ingaged in the quarrel.</P>
<P>The one is extraordinary in all the Lyric kind of Poetry, even in the opinion of his very adversary. The other a Lady (and of more value for being so) not only of great Learn∣ing, but with a Genius admirably turn'd to that sort of it which most becomes her Sex for softness, genteelness, and promoting of virtue; and such as (one would think) is not so liable as other parts of scholarship, to rough disputes, or violent animosity.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="386"/>
Yet it has so happen'd, that no writers, even about Divinity itself, have been more out∣ragious or uncharitable than these two polite authors; by suffering their judgments to be a little warped (if I may use that expression) by the heat of their eager inclinations, to attack or defend so great an Author under debate. I wish for the sake of the public, which is now so well entertained by their quarrel, it may not end at last in their agreeing to blame a third man who is so presumptuous as to censure both, if they should chance to hear of it.</P>
<P>To begin with matter of fact. M. D'Acier has well judg'd, that the best of all Poets cer∣tainly deserved a better translation, at least into French prose, because to see it done in verse was despair'd of: I believe indeed, from a defect in that language, incapable of mounting to any degree of excellence suitable to so very great an undertaking.</P>
<P>She has not only perform'd this task as well as prose can do it, (which is indeed but as the wrong side of tapestry is able to represent the right <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A thought of Cervantes.</NOTE>) she has added to it also many learned and useful annotations. With all which she most obligingly delighted not only her own sex, but most of ours, ignorant of the Greek, and
<PB N="353" REF="387"/>
consequently her adversary himself, who frank∣ly acknowledges that ignorance.</P>
<P>'Tis no wonder therefore, if, in doing this, she is grown so enamour'd of that unspeakably-charming Author, as to have a kind of horror at the least mention of a man bold enough to blame him.</P>
<P>Now as to M. de la Motte, he being already deservedly famous for all sorts of Lyric poetry, was so far introduced by her into those beauties of the Epic kind (tho' but in that way of trans∣lation) as not to resist the pleasure and hope of reputation, by attempting that in verse, which had been applauded so much for the difficulty of doing it even in prose; knowing how this, well executed, must extremely transcend the other.</P>
<P>But, as great Poets are a little apt to think they have an ancient right of being excus'd for vanity on all occasions, he was not content to out-do M. D'Acier, but endeavour'd to out-do Homer himself, and all that ever in any age or nation went before him in the same enterprize; by leaving out, altering, or adding whatever he thought best.</P>
<P>Against this presumptuous attempt, Homer has been in all times so well defended, as not to need my small assistance; yet, I must needs say, his excellencies are such, that for their sakes
<PB N="352" REF="388"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="353" REF="389"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="354" REF="390"/>
he deserves a much gentler touch for his seem∣ing errors. These if M. de la Motte had trans∣lated as well as the rest, with an apology for having retain'd them only out of meer venera∣tion; his judgment, in my opinion, would have appear'd much greater than by the best of his alterations, though I admit them to be written very finely. I join with M. de la Motte in wondering at some odd things in Homer, but 'tis chiefly because of his sublime ones, I was about to say his divine ones, which almost sur∣prize me at finding him any where in the falli∣ble condition of human nature.</P>
<P>And now we are wondering, I am in a diffi∣culty to guess what can be the reason of these exceptions against Homer, from one who has himself translated him, contrary to the general custom of translators. Is there not a little of that in it? I mean to be singular, in getting above the title of a Translator, tho' sufficiently ho∣nourable in this case. For such an ambition no body has less occasion, than one who is so fine a Poet in other kinds; and who must have too much wit to believe, any alteration of an∣other can intitle him to the denomination of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI> himself: tho' no man in this age seems more capable of being a good one, if the French tongue would bear it. Yet in his trans∣lation he has done too well, to leave any doubt
<PB N="355" REF="391"/>
(with all his faults) that her's can be ever par∣allel'd with it.</P>
<P>Besides he could not be ignorant, that find∣ing faults is the most easy and vulgar part of a critic; whereas nothing shews so much skill and taste both, as the being throughly sensible of the sublimest excellencies.</P>
<P>What can we say in excuse of all this? <HI>Hu∣manum est errare:</HI> Since as good a Poet as, I be∣lieve, the French language is capable of, and as sharp a Critic as any nation can produce, has by too much censuring Homer subjected a trans∣lation to censure, that would have otherwise stood the test of the severest adversary.</P>
<P>But since he would needs chuse that wrong way of criticism, I wonder he miss'd a stone so easy to be thrown against Homer, not for his filling the Iliad with so much flaughter (for that is to be excused, since a War is not capable of being described without it) but with so many various particulars of wounds and horror, as shew the writer (I am afraid) so delighted that way him∣self, as not the least to doubt his reader being so also. Like Spanioletta, whose dismal pic∣tures are the more disagreeable for being always so very movingly painted. Even Hector's last parting from his son and Andromache hardly makes us amends for his body's being dragg'd thrice round the town. M. de la Motte in his
<PB N="356" REF="392"/>
strongest objection about that dismal combat, has sufficient cause to blame his inraged adver∣sary; who here gives an instance that it is im∣possible to be violent without committing some mistake; her passion for Homer blinding her too much to perceive the very grossest of his failings. By which warning I am become a lit∣tle more capable of impartiality, though in a dispute about that very Poet for whom I have the greatest veneration.</P>
<P>M. D'Acier might have consider'd a little, that whatever were the motives of M. de la Motte to so bold a proceeding, it could not darken that fame which I am sure she thinks shines securely even after the vain attempts of Plato himself against it: caus'd only perhaps by a like reason with that of Madam D'Acier's anger against M. de la Motte, namely, the finding that in prose his genius (great as it was) could not be capable of the sublime heights of poetry, which therefore he banish'd out of his common-wealth.</P>
<P>Nor were these objections to Homer any more lessening of her merit in translating him as well as that way is capable of, viz. fully, plainly, and elegantly, than the most admira∣ble verses can be any disparagement to as ex∣cellent prose.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="393"/>
The best excuse for all this violence is, its being in a cause which gives a kind of reputa∣tion even to suffering, notwithstanding ever so ill a management of it.</P>
<P>The worst of defending even Homer in such a passionate manner, is its being more a proof of her weakness, than of his being liable to none. For what is it can excuse Homer any more than Hector, for flying at the first sight of Achilles? whose terrible aspect sure needed not such an inexcusable fright to set it off; and methinks all that account of Minerva's restoring his dart to Achilles, comes a little too late, for excusing Hector's so terrible apprehension at the very first.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. 1, 1718.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am much honour'd by your Grace's com∣pliance with my request, in giving me your opinion of the French dispute concerning Ho∣mer. And I shall keep my word, in fairly tel∣ling wherein I disagree from you. It is but in two or three very small points, not so much of the dispute, as of the parties concern'd in it. I
<PB N="358" REF="394"/>
cannot think quite so highly of the Lady's learning, tho' I respect it very much. It is great complaisance in that polite nation, to al∣low her to be a Critic of equal rank with her husband. To instance no further, his remarks on Horace shew more good Sense, Penetration, and a better Taste of his author, and those up∣on Aristotle's Art of poetry more Skill and Science, than any of her's on any author what∣ever <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is a just Character of that excellent Critic.</NOTE>. In truth, they are much more slight, dwell more in generals, and are, besides, for the most part less her own; of which her Remarks upon Homer are an example, where Eustathius is transcribed ten times for once that he is quoted. Nor is there at all more depth of learning in those upon Terence, Plautus, (or where they were most wanted) upon Aristophanes, only the Greek s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holia upon the latter are some of the best extant.</P>
<P>Your Grace will believe me, that I did not search to find defects in a Lady; my employ∣ment upon the Iliad forced me to see them; yet I have had so much of the French complaisance as to conceal her thefts; for wherever I have found her notes to be wholly another's (which is the case in some hundreds) I have barely quoted the true Proprietor without observing upon it. If Madam Dacier has ever seen my
<PB N="359" REF="395"/>
observations, she will be sensible of this con∣duct, but what effect it may have upon a Lady, I will not answer for.</P>
<P>In the next place, as to M. de la Motte, I think your Grace hardly does him right, in sup∣posing he could have no Idea of the beauties of Homer's Epic Poetry, but what he learn'd from Madam Dacier's Prose-translation. There had been a very elegant Prose-translation before, that of Monsieur de la Valterie; so elegant, that the style of it was evidently the original and model of the famous Telemaque. Your Grace very justly animadverts against the too great dispo∣sition of finding faults, in the one, and of con∣fessing none in the other: But doubtless, as to Violence, the Lady has infinitely the better of the Gentleman. Nothing can be more polite, dispassionate, or sensible, than M. de la Motte's manner of managing the dispute: and so much as I see your Grace admires the beauty of his verse (in which you have the suffrage too of the Archbishop of Cambray) I will venture to say, his prose is full as good. I think therefore when you say, no disputants even in Divinity could be more outragious and uncharitable than these two authors, you are a little too hard upon M. de la Motte.

of the passions and pride of mankind in general, that (did but the same interests go along with them) they would carry the learn∣ed world to as violent extremes, animosities, and even persecutions, about variety of opini∣ons in Criticism, as ever they did about Reli∣gion: and that, in defect of Scripture to quarrel upon, we should have French, Italian, and Dutch Commentators ready to burn one another about Homer, Virgil, Terence, and Horace.</P>
<P>I do not wonder your Grace is shock'd at the flight of Hector upon the first appearance of Achilles in the twenty-second Iliad. However (to shew myself a true Commentator, if not a true Critic) I will endeavour to excuse, if not to defend it in my Notes on that book. And to save myself what trouble I can, instead of doing it in this letter, I will draw up the sub∣stance of what I have to say for it in a separate paper, which I'll shew your Grace when next we meet. I will only desire you to allow me, that Hector was in an absolute certainty of death, and depress'd over and above with the conscience of being in an ill cause. If your heart be so great, as not to grant the first of these will sink the spirit of a Hero, you'll at least be so good, as to allow the second may. But, I can tell your Grace, no less a Hero than my Lord Peterborow, when a person compli∣mented

<P>I Am extremely obliged to you for taking no∣tice of a poor old distressed courtier, com∣monly the most despiseable thing in the world. This blow has so rous'd <HI>Scriblerus</HI> that he has recover'd his senses, and thinks and talks like other men. From being frolicksome and gay he is turn'd grave and morose. His lucubra∣tions lie neglected among old news-papers, cases, petitions, and abundance of unanswer∣able letters. I wish to God they had been among the papers of a noble Lord sealed up. Then might Scriblerus have pass'd for the Pre∣tender, and it would have been a most excel∣lent and laborious work for the Flying Post or some such author, to have allegoriz'd all his ad∣ventures into a plot, and found out mysteries somewhat like the Key to the Lock. Martin's

office is now the second door on the left hand in Dover-street, where he will be glad to see Dr. Parnelle, Mr. Pope, and his old friends, to whom he can still afford a half pint of claret. It is with some pleasure that he contemplates the world still busy, and all mankind at work for him. I have seen a letter from Dean Swift; he keeps up his noble spirit, and tho' like a man knock'd down, you may behold him still with a stern countenance, and aiming a blow at his adversaries. I will add no more, being in haste, only that I will never forgive you if you don't use my aforesaid house in Dover-street with the same freedom as you did that in St. James's; for as our friendship was not be∣gun upon the relation of a courtier, so I hope it will not end with it. I will always be proud to be reckon'd amongst the number of your friends and humble servants.</P>

<P>I Am glad your Travels delighted you; im∣prove you, I am sure, they could not; you are not so much a youth as that, tho' you run about with a King of sixteen, and (what makes
<PB N="363" REF="399"/>
him still more a child) a King of Frenchmen. My own time has been more melancholy, spent in an attendance upon death, which has seized one of our family: my mother is something better, though at her advanced age every day is a climacteric. There was joined to this an in∣disposition of my own, which I ought to look upon as a slight one compared with my mother's because my life is not of half the consequence to any body that her's is to me. All these in∣cidents have hinder'd my more speedy reply to your obliging letter.</P>
<P>The article you enquire of, is of as little concern to me as you desire it should; namely the railing papers about the Odyssey. If the book has merit, it will extinguish all such nasty scandal; as the Sun puts an end to stinks, mere∣ly by coming out.</P>
<P>I wish I had nothing to trouble me more; an honest mind is not in the power of any dis∣honest one. To break its peace, there must be some guilt or consciousness, which is inconsis∣tent with its own principles. Not but malice and injustice have their day, like some poor short-lived vermine that die in shooting their own stings. Falshood is Folly (says Homer) and liars and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves, even in this world: in the next, 'tis charity to say, God have mercy on them! they
<PB N="364" REF="400"/>
were the devil's vicegerents upon earth, who is the father of lies, and, I fear, has a right to dis∣pose of his children.</P>
<P>I've had an occasion to make these reflections of late more justly than from any thing that concerns my writings, for it is one that con∣cerns my morals, and (which I ought to be as tender of as my own) the good character of an∣other very innocent person, who I'm sure shares your friendship no less than I do. No creature has better natural dispositions, or would act more rightly or reasonably in every duty, did she act by herself, or from herself; but you know it is the misfortune of that family to be governed like a ship, I mean the Head guided by the Tail, and that by every wind that blows in it.</P>

<P>YOUR Lordship may be surpriz'd at the liberty I take in writing to you; tho' you will allow me always to remember, that you once permitted me that honour, in conjunction with some others who better deserved it. I
<PB N="365" REF="401"/>
hope you will not wonder I am still desirous to have you think me your grateful and faithful servant; but, I own, I have an ambition yet far∣ther, to have others think me so, which is the occasion I give your Lordship the trouble of this. Poor Parnell, before he died, left me the charge of publishing these few remains of his: I have a strong desire to make them, their au∣thor, and their publisher, more considerable, by addressing and dedicating them all to you. There is a pleasure in bearing testimony to truth, and a vanity perhaps, which at least is as excusable as any vanity can be. I beg you, my Lord, to allow me to gratify it in prefixing this paper of honest verses to the book. I send the book itself, which, I dare say, you'll receive more satisfaction in perusing, than you can from any thing written upon the subject of yourself. Therefore I am a good deal in doubt, whether you will care for such an addition to it. All I shall say for it is, that 'tis the only dedication I ever writ, and shall be the only one, whether you accept of it or not: for I will not bow the knee to a less man than my Lord Oxford, and I expect to see no greater in my time.</P>
<P>After all, if your Lordship will tell my Lord Harley that I must not do this, you may de∣pend upon a suppression of these verses (the

I look back indeed to those evenings I have usefully and pleasantly spent, with Mr. Pope, Mr. Par∣nel, Dean Swift, the Doctor, &amp;c.

<P>Net to trouble you at present with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cital of all my Obligations to you, I shall only mention <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe things, which Stake particularly kind of you: your desire that I should write to you, and your proposal of giving me twenty Guineas to change my Religion, which last you must give me leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e make the subject of this Letter.</P>
<P>Sure <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Clergyman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver offered so much out of his own purse for the sake of any Religion. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is al∣most as many pieces of Gold, as an Apostle could get of Silver from the priests of old, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a much more valuable consideration. I believe it will be better worth my white to propose a change of my Faith by subscription, than a translation of Homer. And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convince you, how well disposed I am to the re∣formation, I shall be content, if you can prevail with my Lord Treasurer, and the ministry, to rise to the same Sum, each of them, on this pious account, as my Lord Hallifax has done on the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phane one. I am afraid there's no being at once a poet and a good Christian, and I am very much strai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned
<PB N="370" REF="406"/>
between two, while the Whigs seem willing to contri∣bute as much, to continue me the one as you would to make me the other. But, if you can move every man in the Government, who has above ten thou∣sand pounds a Year, to subscribe as much as your∣self, I shall become a convert, as most men do, when the Lord turns it to my Interest. I know they have the truth of Religion so much at Heart, that they'd certainly give more to have one good sub∣ject, translated from Popery to the Church of Eng∣land, than twenty heathenish authors out of any unknown tongue into ours. I therefore commission you, M<SUP>r</SUP>. Dean, with full authority, to transact this affair in my name, and to propose as f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. First, that as to the head of our Church, the Pope, I may engage to renounce his power, whensoever I shall receive any particular indulg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncies from the head of your Church, the Queen.</P>
<P>As to communion in one kind, I shall also promise to change it for communion in both; as soon as the Ministry will allow me.</P>
<P>For invocations to Saints, mine shall be turned to dedications to sinners, when I shall find the great ones of this World as willing to do me any good, as I believe those of the other are.</P>
<P>You see I shall not be obstinate in the main points;
<PB N="371" REF="407" MS="y"/>
but there is one article I must reserve, and which you seemed not unwilling to allow me, prayer for the dead. There are people to whose Souls I wish as well, as to my own; and I must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rave leave, humbly to lay before them, that though the subscriptions abovementioned will suffice for myself, there are necessary perquisites and Additions, which I must demand on the score of this charitable arti∣cle. It is also to be considered, that the greater part of those, whose Souls I am most concerned for, were unfortunately hereties, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hismaties, poets, painters, or persons of such lives and manners, as few or no Churches are willing to save. The expence will therefore be the greater, to make an effectual provision for the said Souls.</P>
<P>Old Dryden, though a Roman Catholic, was a Poet, and 'tis revealed in the visions of some anci∣ent Saints, that no Poet was ever saved under some hundred of Masses. I cannot set his delivery from purgatory at less than fifty Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Walsh was not only a Soci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an, but (what you'll own is harder to be saved) a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hig. He cannot modestly be rated at less than an hundred.</P>
<P>L'Estrange, being a Jory, we compute him but at twenty Pounds which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o friend of the party can deny to give, to keep him from damning in
<PB N="372" REF="408"/>
the next life, considering they never gave him Six∣pence to keep him from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arving in this.</P>
<P>All this together amounts to one hundred and seventy pounds.</P>
<P>In the next place, I must desire you to represent, that there are several of my friends yet living, when I design, God willing, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in consi∣deration of Legacies; out of which it is a doctrine in the reformed Church, that not a farthing shall be allowed to save their Souls who gave them.</P>
<P>There is one **** who will dye within these few months, with ****** one M<SUP>r</SUP>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erras, who hath grievously offended in making the likeness of almost all things in heaven above and earth below. And one M<SUP>r</SUP>. Gay, an unhappy Youth, who writes pas∣terals during the time of divine service, whose case is the more deplerable, as he hath miserably lavish∣ed away all that silver he should have reserved for his Soul's health, in buttons and loops for his Coat.</P>
<P>I can't pretend, to have these people honestly saved un∣der some hundred pounds, whether you consider the difficulty of such a work, or the extreme love and ten∣derness I bear them, which will infallibly make me push this Charity as far as I am able. There is but one more whose salvation I insist upon, and then I have done: but indeed it may prove of so much
<PB N="373" REF="409"/>
greater charge than all the rest, that I will only lay the Case before you and the ministry, and lay to their prudence and generosity, what sum they shall think fit to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston upon it.</P>
<P>The person I mean, is D<SUP>r</SUP>. Swift; a dignified cler∣gyman, butone, who, by his own confession, has composed m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> libels than sermons. If it be true, what I have heard often affirm'd by innocent peo∣ple, That too much wit is dangerous to salvation, this unfortunate Gentleman must certainly be damned to all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnity. But, I hope his long experi∣ence in the world, and frequent conversation with great men, will cause him (as it has some others) to have less and less wit every day. Be it as it will, I should not think my own Soul deserved to be saved, if I did not endeavour to save his; for I have all the Obligations in nature to him. He has brought me into better company than I cared for, made me merrier when I was sick than I had a mind to be, and put me upon making poems on purpose, that he might alter them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought I could never have discharged my debt to his kindness, but have lately been informed, to my unspeakable comfort that I have more than paid it all. For Monsieur de Montagne has assured me, "that the person who receives a
<PB N="374" REF="410"/>
benefit obliges the giver:" for since the chief endea∣vour of one friend is to do good to the other, he who administers both the matter and occasion is the—man who is liberal. At this rate it is impossible D<SUP>r</SUP>.

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a Lady, in the Name of her Brother.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not a chaste Ear, and a pure Heart, do not peruse this Letter; for as <HI>Jeremy Taylor</HI> says, in his <HI>Holy Living and Dying,</HI> the first thing a Virgin ought to endeavour, is to be ignorant of the <HI>Distinction</HI> of <HI>Sexes.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the Confidence I have, that you are thus inno∣cent, that I endeavour to gratify your Curiosity, in a Point which I am sensible none but a Brother could do with Decency.</P>
<P>I shall entertain you with the most reigning Curiosity in the Town, I mean a Person who is equally the Toast of Gentlemen and Ladies, and is at present more uni∣versally admired than any of either Sex: You know few Proficients have a greater Genius for Monsters than my∣self; but I never tasted a Monster to that Degree I have done this Creature: It was not, like other Monsters, produced in the Deserts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> nor come from the Country of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> but is the Production of the Joint endeavours of a <HI>Kentish</HI> Parson and his Spouse, who intended, in the Singleness of Heart, to have begot a Christian but of one Sex, and Providence has sent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various Opinions concerning the Creature about Town; Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> observes, that the Age is very licentious, and the present Reign very lewd and corrupt, in permitting a Lady, <HI>by Authority,</HI> (as appears by the printed Bills) to expose her personal Curiosities for a Shilling.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="412"/>
Mr. <HI>P.</HI> looks upon it as a Prodigy portending some great Revolution in the State: To strengthen which Opi∣nion, he produces the following Prophecy of <HI>Nostrada∣mus,</HI> which he explains politically.</P>
<LG>
<L>When as two Sexes join'd in one,</L>
<L>Shall in the Realm of <HI>Brute</HI> be shewn;</L>
<L>Than Factions shall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choose a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This Prodigy of common Gender,</L>
<L>Is neither Sex, but a Pretender,</L>
<L>So the Lord shield the Faith's Defender.</L>
</LG>
<P>Mrs. <HI>N</HI>—admires what People wonder at so much, and says <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he is just so herself: the Dutchess of <HI>S</HI>—is of the same Opinion.</P>
<P>Among these various Conjectures, that I might be informed of the Truth, I took along with me a Physici∣an and a Divine; the one to inspect the State of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The Persons I made choice of, were the ingenious Dr. <HI>P</HI>—and the Reverend Mr.—. We were no sooner in the Room, but the Party came to us, dress'd in that Habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophroditical Imitation of Men—Your sharp Wit, my dear Sister, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-Habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or myself looked first. The Priest you will maliciously fancy was in his Nature most an Infidel, and doubted most of this Miracle: We there∣fore proposed to him to take the surest Method of believ∣ing, seeing, and feeling: He complied with both Ad∣monitions; and having taken a large Pinch of Snuff upon it, advised us with a Nod, that we should by no
<PB N="20" REF="413"/>
means regard it as a Female, but as a Male; for by so doing, we should be guilty of less Sinfulness.</P>
<P>The Doctor, upon Inspection, differed from this Opi∣nion; he would by no means allow it a Miracle, or at most a natural one: He said, upon the whole, it was a Woman; that whatever might give a Handle to think otherwise, was a Trifle, nothing being more common than for a Child to be marked with that thing which the Mother longed for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's Temper of Mind, it appears to be a most even Disposition, partaking of the good Qualities of both Sexes; for she is neither so inaccessible as other Ladies, nor is he so impudent as other Gentlemen: Of how obliging and complaisant a Turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gen∣tleman, and that she tells the Gentlemen she has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a Lady. As a further Proof of this affable Disposition, he formerly received Visits of the fair Sex in their Masques, till an impertinent Fellow in a female Disguise mingled with a Party of Ladies, and impudent∣ly overheard their improving Speculations.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, she civilly promised at my Re∣quest, that my two Sisters should be admitted privately, whenever you wou'd do her the Honour of your Con∣sideration.</P>
<P>How agreeable soever this Sight has been to me, I assure you it cannot be so pleasing as the Sight of you in Town, and whatever you may see in the Country, I dare affirm, no Man or Woman can shew you the like.</P>
<P>I therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this Place; for tho' indeed like most other Brothers, I should be sorry you were married at my Expence, yet
<PB N="21" REF="414"/>
I would by no Means, like them, detain you in the Country from your Admirers; for, you may believe me, no Brother in the World ever lov'd a Sister as I do you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not describe <HI>Bl</HI>—in particular, not to forestal your Expectations before you see it: Only take a short Account, which, I will hazard my little Credit, is no unjust one. I never saw so great a thing with so much Littleness in it: I think the Architect built it entirely in Complaisance to the Taste of its Owners: For it is the most inhospitable thing imagin∣able, and the most selfish: It has, like their own Hearts, no room for Strangers, and no Reception for any Per∣son of superior Quality to themselves. There are but just two Apartments, for the Master and Mistress, be∣low; and but two Apartments above, (very much in∣ferior to them) in the whole House. When you look upon the Outside, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you see the Inside, it is too little for a Subject; and has not Conveniency to lodge a com∣mon Family. It is a House of Entries and Passages; among which there are three Vista's thro' the whole, very uselessly handsome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but spoil'd by two Arches to∣wards the End of it, which take away the Sight of se∣veral of the Windows. There are two ordinary Stair∣cases instead of one great one. The best Things, with∣in the House, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well proportioned; and the Cellars and Offices under∣ground, which are the most commodious, and the best contrived of the whole. At the Top of the Building
<PB N="23" REF="416"/>
are several Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill Essect, and make the Building look at once finical and heavy. What seems of the best Taste, is that Front towards the Gardens, which is not yet loaded with these Turrets. The two Sides of the Building are entirely spoiled by two monstrous Bow-windows, which stand just in the middle, instead of Doors: And as if it were fatal, that some trifling Littleness should every where destroy the Grandeur, there are in the chief Front two Semi-circles of a lower Structure than the rest, that cut off the Angles, and look as if they were purposely de∣signed to hide a loftier and nobler Piece of Building, the Top of which appears above them. In a Word, the whole is a most expensive Absurdity; and the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> gave a true Character of it, when he said, it was a great <HI>Quarry of Stones above Ground.</HI></P>
<P>We paid a visit to the Spring, where <HI>Rosamond</HI> bathed herself; on a Hill where remains only a Piece of a Wall of the old Palace of <HI>Henry</HI> II. We toasted her Shade in the cold Water, not without a Thought or two, scarce so cold as the Liquor we drank it in. I dare not tell you what they were, and so hasten to conclude,</P>
