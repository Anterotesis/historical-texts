<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, I was only afraid my visit to-day was troublesome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it, my dear Easy, far from it; to take a scrambling dinner with me here at the playhouse, the first day of our opening was a great act of charity, and I am very much obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; I assure you it is a matter of informa∣tion to me as well as entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, perhaps you thought our fare behind the scenes still more unsubstantial?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did indeed; and from what I have so often witnes∣sed on the stage, how could I suppose otherwise? why, I have seen Macbeth's Scotch nobles as poorly regaled as if they were in the Cave of Famine; not a hut on the Highlands could furnish worse provender; nay, I have seen our jovial Harry the Eighth, and all his courtiers, half starved by Cardinal Wolsey at a ban∣quet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I have known the Miller of Mansfield at supper make half the house hungry; and many a farce, as well as pantomime, has owed its life on the stage to a roast fowl and sausages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master Manager, here's a good season to you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And towards September I'll come and borrow a few hundreds of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Publick are very kind and extremely generous; but I do assure you, my friend, all I have yet re∣ceiv'd
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
here has been disburs'd again for their accom∣modation and entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but stock in trade, you know—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SERVANT.</STAGE>
<P>A Mr. Bustleton, Sir, has been inquiring after you at the stage-door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bustleton, I think he said was his name, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bustleton! they did not say I was in the house, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They said they did not know, Sir; and he is gone behind the scenes to look for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the gentleman through to the boxes directly, d'ye hear? <STAGE>[Exit Serv.]</STAGE> It would be particularly in∣convenient to see him at present; no knowing when we shou'd get rid of him; he'll talk to eternity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bustleton; that's the idle man of business, is it not? who does an infinite deal of nothing, because he wants something to do:—Talk! why his tongue travels
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
post, and all his sentences are periods of a mile; he converses with every body, upon every thing; Scan∣dal, Politicks, Religion, Arts, Tabernacles, Theatres, the Court and the Cock-pit, Newmarket and the Con∣vocation, and a thousand other objects, divide his atten∣tion. He knows the publick and private affairs of the town, and the nation, much better than those of his family; and is perfectly at home every where but in his own house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very man; his head is in a constant whirl of ideas, and his person in perpetual motion; he is known among his friends and acquaintance by the title of the Riding Magazine: he lives about a dozen miles out of town, but doats upon London; comes up on a hard trot every day after breakfast, stops every friend he meets to receive and communicate intelligence, and enquires after news from the men at the turnpikes; nay, sometimes, to hold himself in wind, tells the keeper of the gate at Kensington what he learnt srom the toll-gatherer at Hammersmith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>without.</STAGE>
<P>I'll step in directly; and please to take care of my galloshes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>There he is, and coming in too; I hear him in the passage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it; you shall introduce me to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh there will be no occasion for that; you'll find him a very familiar acquaintance at first sight, I pro∣mise you.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BUSTLETON.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! my little Dapperwit! I knew I shou'd find you at the Receipt of Custom; I thought to have met with you behind the scenes, like a tradesman behind the counter. I went there, but was told you were in Jewell's parlour—but hold! I hear very bad—<STAGE>(seeing Easy.)</STAGE> Oh! how dy'e do, Mr.—what's the Gentleman's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Easy, at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Easy, I din'd with an Uncle of yours yes∣terday at the Thatch'd—by the bye, you must give me leave to pull off my riding-stockings and great coat, Mr. Dapperwit; I think my linen begins to look rather soiled too; and if I thought yours wou'd fit me, I wou'd get you to lend me one of your shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occasion; your appearance is very—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>So so, I believe; I have been in twenty different places, and engag'd on twenty different affairs, since I got to town this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are never idle, Mr. Bustleton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Idle! it is impossible for a man that has three ideas in his head to be idle; every moment affords new diversions, and every hour teems with employment: Mr. Easy, I beg to have your opinion on this subject—by the bye, Mr. Dapperwit, remember that I have something of consequence to tell you afterwards;—you are a Gentleman, Mr. Easy, and none but a Gentle∣man can have a just notion of creating himself business—Tradesmen, Merchants, Bankers, Brokers, Law∣yers, and so forth, have no idea of business out of the narrow routine of their own dull vocations—and in∣deed it is not every Gentleman that has a sufficient ta∣lent for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one in a thousand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in ten thousand; I see you comprehend me, Mr. Easy; I love to talk with a man upon a subject that he is master of; for then we, each of us, give and receive information—One day talking with Admiral Sternpost at the Navy Office about the Battle of La Hogue—by the bye, that is a very good story; so put me in mind to tell you that afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you were going to tell us what you had been doing to-day, Mr. Bustleton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-day? I was so—but the human mind, you know—I say <HI>you know,</HI> Mr. Dapperwit, because you are a writer of Plays, and Farces, and Preludes, and Prologues, and Epilogues, and so forth; and the human mind is, or ought to be, your proper study—now the human mind is very apt, from a kind of as∣sociation of ideas, as Locke says, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we wish to know what you were going to dis∣close concerning yourself to-day, Mr. Bustleton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-day? true; but remember that we settle the state of the human mind another time, Mr. Dap∣perwit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will—but to-day's business, to-day, if you please, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Multifarious, as usual; first, a Committee of Asso∣ciation—then a short peep at the Exhibition—then a Ballot at the India House—then an hour and a half in the Gallery of the House of Commons—then a Cause in the House of Lords—after which I took a hasty morsel at the coffee-house, which I left half unfinish'd to run and tell you some news of very great impor∣tance to yourself, Mr. Dapperwit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great importance! what is it? why did not you communicate it immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, an hour or two makes no difference; for as you cannot possibly have any Play this evening—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Play this Evening! why not? who told you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always find I know more of other peoples' affairs than they do themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, put him out of his pain, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take me off the rack of suspence, or give me the <HI>Coup de Grace</HI> at once, I beseech you, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not observe to you, that all Managers are jealous of one another, and that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor fellow! the fact at once, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, what is it, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fact is, Sir, that the winter patentees have determin'd to strip you of all your performers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it; a committee of patentees have sat upon the question in the treasury of Covent Garden—and a sub-committee at Drury Lane; the chairman has reported—and a very ingenious report, let me tell you—He has reported that the patent of Drury Lane is thrice septennial, both those of Covent Garden per∣petual, and the Hay-market, only annual; yet that your influence on the town has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminish'd; that they ought to take away your board of actors, make your wardrobe useless (By the bye, they say that of your predecessor was furnish'd by contract) and attack your civil list; in short, that <HI>one</HI> house shou'd withdraw their performers, and the <HI>other</HI> forbid theirs from supplying their places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can't be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I recollect, I have seen something of this in the papers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the papers, I know more of the manoeuvres of this opposition than all the Advertisers, Posts, Chronicles, and Courants put together.</P>

<P><Q>“I am very sorry to find myself unable to join your company this summer; particularly as I had taken a long lease of three years, of a country-house within half a quarter of a mile of Westmin∣ster-bridge, on purpose to attend to my own health and your business; but am oblig'd to give up both my house and my engagement, as I find the mois∣ture of Lambeth Marsh and the heat of the Hay-market too much for my constitution; so shall retire to my lodgings in Drury Lane during the dog days, and remain, with the best wishes for your” success, your humble servant,</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>And here's another, with a new song at the end of it, for Free-mason's-hall.</P>

<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but ladies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear Sir, say no more; we <HI>must</HI> give the schools for eloquence the preference to the theatres; the pro∣fit is much greater, and the trouble much less.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure; for on the stage we are expected to be ripe in our parts, or to encounter censure and disap∣probation; one might as well sing at Sadlers Wells, or ride upon three horses at Astley's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but in the other elegant assemblies if we shou'd
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
be rather imperfect in an extempore oration, or if we shou'd happen to boggle in the midst of a sentence—from the copy of the speech being given us too late, or from our other avocations preventing our studying it—we have nothing to do but to hem, or cough a little, hold our fans to our faces for half a minute, and thus, overcome with modesty, sit down amidst a thunder of applause.</P>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen! I am desir'd by the Ma∣nager to inform you, that he is extremely unhappy that he finds himself totally unable to present you with the entertainments announced for this evening; but being, from various unforeseen causes, depriv'd of the assistance of the performers, he is oblig'd to request your usual indulg—</P>
<STAGE>IRISHMAN, <HI>from the Pit.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Before you say any more, my dear—Mr. Promp∣ter, that's your name, I think—give me leave to ax
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
you one little quiston; It's for want of play actors that we are to have no Play at all, is not it, Honey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IRISHMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, upon my soul now, that's no rason at all—have not we got the playhouse for all night—and mayn't we be the play actors ourselves? have not half the Jontlemen and Ladies in England been playing the fool all over the country, and has not your own little Manager there been blacking his own little face at Christmas down in North Wales? Have not your Lords and fine Ladies been taking off Miniature Pictures, just by the Bath road? and have not the folks been taking Miniature copies at Large in Drury Lane? and are not there two great Houses down at Westminster,—(not to spake of Westminster Hall)—where the Lords and Jontlemen are talking all day, and all night too fait, for their own diversion and that of the Pub∣lick? And pray now where's the want of a Play at your Schools for Eloquence, where the company can every night act a little play of their own? and why shou'd your foolish Manager pay his Actors for talking, when the Publick will pay him for letting them talk them∣selves? For my part, I am a true born Irishman, and one of the Loyal Volunteers; and so I stand up for the privileges of an Englishman—and I insist upon it, that the most material part of a Playhouse is the Au∣dience; and as long as the Audience are present, it does not signify a brass farthing whether there are Actors or no; and I say—I say—I have nothing more to say at all.</P>

<STAGE>LADY <HI>from the Balcony.</HI></STAGE>
<P>I beg leave, with all the diffidence natural to my sex, to offer a short word on the present occasion: the gentleman who has just spoken, if I may trust to his accent and dialect, is of a nation, to which ladies are inclin'd to be partial; but it must be acknowledged that sometimes, from being very fully possess'd of a subject, they are apt not to think it necessary to make it quite clear to other people; in this sublime confu∣sion of ideas, I apprehend, the ingenious gentleman in my eye has forgot to speak to the main question now before this assembly—The question urg'd by the gen∣tleman on the floor, I conceive to be the Distress of the Manager; now this pretended Distress, I humbly contend, is, or ought to be, no Distress at all; What is the Plea? want of auxiliaries. But if the Winter Potentates will not let out their troops upon subsidies, are there no other forces to be rais'd? and is not a time of Theatrical Contest as well as that of National War, the very moment to raise them? Is Human Nature confin'd or exhausted? I know the fact to be otherwise. Are not there hundreds of able bodied actors, besides those in the hun∣dreds of Drury? are there no Theatrical Plants grow∣ing out of the hot beds of Covent Garden? Millions! every house, every shop is a nursery. Is there a Milli∣ner's Pren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice in Town, that has not offer'd herself to the Manager, and is not already perfect in Jane Shore and Lady Townly? or a Hair Dresser that is not anxi∣ous to throw away his pomatum and curling irons, for a Dagger and a Truncheon? Let the Manager <HI>skirr the Country round!</HI> let him bring upon the Town, what the Town are always glad to see, some
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
new faces! let him produce too some good pieces! and then his Distresses will be reliev'd, and he will be sure of Publick Encouragement, without being reduc'd to the disgrace and mortification of a dismission or an apology.</P>
<STAGE>[Sits down.</STAGE>
<STAGE>(GENTLEMAN <HI>from the opposite Balcony.)</HI></STAGE>
<P>I humbly beg to offer a few loose thoughts on the question now under agitation<HI>—the Distress of the Ma∣nager.</HI> This Distress is founded on the absence of the actors; but if we can supply their absence, without being encumber'd with their presence, I humbly con∣ceive we shall be considerable gainers—a proposal was formerly made to present the Publick with actors in paste-board, and it was much doubted whether they wou'd not be preferable to the race of live actors. What were the actors of Menander the Grecian? Paste∣board! What were those of Plautus the Roman? Paste-board! What were those of Terence the Car∣thaginian? Paste-board! to what then can the Britons have recourse, but Paste-board? Busts on this plan have been exibited in this very Theatre, and are now actually exibiting in another place; if therefore the Manager will give us the delinquent performers in Paste-board, while the artist takes off the figures and faces, I will endeavour to give you their manner and voices.</P>

The part of Lady Randolph to be performed by Mrs. <HI>Crawford,</HI> who has not appeared on this stage these thirteen years, nor in London—during the whole winter season!</P>
