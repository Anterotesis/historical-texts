<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE English STAGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE DRAMA did not so much as grow into any Form in <HI>England</HI>, till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. It met, indeed, with some kind of <HI>Es∣tablishment</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; but flourished in That of King <HI>James</HI> I. Arts were cultivated, till the Beginning of our Intestine Broils in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I, when the Dramatic Muse was banished, and all the Arts degraded.</P>
<P>The Design of this Work is to give a faithful Account of the Stage and its Pro∣gress;
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
and to convey the Names of some of our most eminent Players, to a little longer Date, than Nature has given their Bodies.</P>
<P>But, before we descend to Particulars, let us, with a noble Peer, take a general View of that Period when MONARCHY was RE∣STORED; under which Administration the <HI>Drama</HI> was raised to its highest Degree of Perfection.</P>
<P><Q>“I behold (says Lord <HI>Lansdowne</HI>) a KING, with a guilty Nation at his Feet, raising his Enemies from the Ground, taking them by the Hand as if they had never offend∣ed: Sour hypocritical Zeal and Grimace turned, as by Inchantment, all at once into good Humour and open-hearted Chear∣fulness: Majesty and Splendor in the Court, Decency and Discipline in the Church, Dig∣nity and Condescension in the Nobility, Plenty and Hospitality in the Country, Opulence in the City, good Nature and good Manners amongst all Ranks and Con∣ditions of Men; Trade flourishing, Na∣vigation extended, Manufactures improved, Arts and Sciences encouraged, Wit abound∣ing, the Muses restored, the Gown respect∣ed; and above all, Liberty, <HI>real</HI> Liberty secured to Perpetuity, by that great Bul∣wark the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act. This is the Scene which then presented it self, and ”I look back with Pleasure upon it.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lord <HI>Lansdowne</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Remarks, &amp;c.</HI> 1732, 4to. pag. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>The STAGE having been always accounted a most rational and instructive Entertainment; has therefore met with all proper En∣couragement in the wisest Governments, and been supported by the wisest Men. The <HI>English</HI> Theatre has risen for a Series of many Years under the Patronage of Princes, and appeared in greater Lustre than any other; and, what still seems more extraordinary, is, that some of the most eminent Writers in the Dramatic way, have been themselves Play∣ers; of which SHAKESPEARE and OTWAY are immortal Instances.</P>
<P>I believe, no Nation in the World can boast of having produced so many excellent <HI>Writers</HI> for the Stage, nor so many inimita∣ble <HI>Performers</HI>, as our Own. The Memory of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>; Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Old∣field</HI>'s Performances are still fresh among us: And as their Merit rendered them universal∣ly admired, their Loss is now as universally lamented.</P>
<P>But, here it ought to be observed, that as Wit, good Sense, and Politeness were abso∣lutely necessary to support the Character and Dignity of the Scene; it was always thought proper to intrust the Management of the Theatre, to Persons who were supposed to be justly qualified to judge of all Performances fit to be introduced in that Place; that Works of Genius might meet with suitable
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
Encouragement, and Dullness and Immorality be effectually excluded.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> long had the <HI>Stage</HI> under his Direction; and he, undoubtedly, wanted no Abilities to <HI>distinguish</HI> Merit; nor have I ever heard that he wanted Inclination to <HI>reward</HI> it. And as eminent as he was allowed to be, yet he thought it, adviseable, and no way un∣worthy of him, to join with those who were professed Players. And of late Years Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, as they were all eminent in their Professions, as Ac∣tors; their own Interest, as well as the <HI>Hon∣our</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI>, made them industrious to support it in full Credit. The <HI>two</HI> former of these Patentees are dead; and so is that Envy which pursued them in their Lives. We have now no Memory for their <HI>Failings</HI>, and only retain the pleasing Remembrance of their various <HI>Excellencies</HI>.</P>
<P>From these general Observations then, we may perceive, that it hath been always thought essential to the Preservation of the Stage, and the Encouragement of Authors, to have the management of the Theatre com∣mitted to proper Persons, who had given some Public Proof of their Capacity to judge, what would be most instructive or agreeable to the Taste of an <HI>English</HI> Audience; as will, in the Course of this Undertaking, be fully shewn.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Duke of <HI>YORK</HI>'s Company under Sir <HI>WILLIAM D'AVENANT, 1662;</HI> and the <HI>UNION</HI> betwixt the <HI>KING</HI>'s and <HI>DUKE</HI>'s Company, <HI>1682.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE shall begin these MEMOIRS of PLAYERS, with an Account of, our <HI>English</HI> ROSCIUS, Mr. <HI>Thomas Betterton</HI>, whom we may suppose in his own particular Person, on a Foot with that Illustrious <HI>Ro∣man</HI>; especially when we consider that Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was excellent both in <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI>; whereas, by all we can discover, ROSCIUS was famous for <HI>Comedy</HI> only.</P>
<P>As to his Descent, he was the Son of Mr. <HI>Thomas Betterton</HI>, Under-Cook to King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st, born in <HI>Tothill-street, West∣minster</HI>, in the Year 1637. He had a very good Education, and when he was come to Years sufficient, by his own Choice, his Fa∣ther put him to Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI>, a Bookseller at <HI>Charing-Cross</HI>; Mr. <HI>Edward Kynaston</HI> was Fellow-'Prentice with him.</P>
<P>I must not here pass by Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Loyalty and Courage; who, tho' but a mere Stripling, went a Volunteer into the King's Service, as Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mohun</HI>, had done before him. They were all Four engaged at the Battle of <HI>Edge-Hill</HI>, in <HI>Warwickshire</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Mohun</HI> so re∣markably
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
signalized himself in this Engage∣ment, that the Major, who commanded our young Cavaliers, being shot, his Commission was given to Him.</P>
<P>After the Murder of the King, these Gentlemen all became Players; but what more immediately brought Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> upon the Stage, was their Mas∣ter's having, formerly, been <HI>Wardrobe-Keeper</HI> to the King's Company of Comedians in <HI>Black-Fryars</HI>. And upon the March of General <HI>Monck</HI> with his Army, from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Lon∣don</HI>, in the Year 1659, Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> obtained from the Powers then in being, a Licence to set up a Company of Players in the <HI>Cock∣pit</HI>, in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, and soon made it com∣pleat; his two Apprentices, <HI>Betterton</HI> for Men's Parts, and <HI>Kynaston</HI> for Women's, be∣ing the Head of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, tho' now but twenty-two Years of Age, acquired very great Applause by his Performances in <HI>The Loyal Subject. The Wild-Goose-Chace. The Spanish Curate</HI>; and several other Plays of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>. But, while our young Actor was thus rising, under his Master <HI>Rhodes</HI>, Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI> procured a Patent of King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId, for erecting a Com∣pany under the Title of <HI>The Duke of</HI> YORK'<HI>s Servants</HI>, and took Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, and all who acted under Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI>, into his Com∣pany; and in the Year 1662, opened a THEA∣TRE in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, with the <HI>first</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
and <HI>second</HI> Parts of <HI>The Siege of</HI> RHODES, having new Scenes, and Decorations of the Stage, which were then first used in <HI>England</HI>.</P>
<P>Altho' this be affirmed by Some, Others have laid it to the Charge of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, as a Crime that he was the first Innovator on our rude Stage; and that such Innovations were the Destruction of good Playing; but I think with very little Shew of Reason, and very little Knowledge of the Stages of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>, where, I am apt to believe, was, in their flourishing Times, as great Actors, as ever played here, before Curtains. For how that which helps the Representation, by as∣sisting the pleasing Delusion of the Mind in regard of the Place, should spoil the Acting I cannot imagine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenian</HI> Stage was so much adorned, that the very Ornaments or Decorations cost the State more Money, than their Wars a∣gainst the <HI>Persians</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI>; tho' their Dramatic Poets were much inferior to the <HI>Greeks</HI>, (if we may guess at those, who are perished, by those who remain) were yet not behind them, in the Magnificence of the Theatre to heighten the Pleasure of the Re∣presentation. If this was Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Thought, it was very just; since the Audi∣ence must be often puzzled to find the Place and Situation of the Scene, which gives great Light to the Play, and helps to deceive us agreeably, while they saw nothing before them but some <HI>Linsey-Wolsey</HI> Curtains, or at best some
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
Piece of old Tapestry filled with aukward Fi∣gures, such as were disagreeable to the Audience. This therefore I must urge as his Praise, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> endeavoured to compleat that Repre∣sentation which was before but imperfect.</P>
<P>At what time his Grace the Right Ho∣nourable <HI>George Villiers</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI> began to write his REHEARSAL, we can∣not exactly learn; but thus much may be certainly gathered from the Plays satirized in it, that it was before the End of the Year 1663, and it is demonstrable that it was fi∣nished before the End of 1664, because it had been several times Rehearsed, the Players were perfect in their Parts, and all things were in readiness for its Acting before the great Plague in 1665, which prevented its being played. What was then intended be∣ing very different from what now appears. In <HI>That</HI> the Poet was called BILBOA, by which Name Sir <HI>Robert Howard</HI> was the Person pointed at. During this Interval, many Plays were brought upon the Stage written in He∣roic Rhime; and on the Death of Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI> in 1668, whom Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> suc∣ceeded as Poet-Laureat, it became still in greater Vogue: This moved the Duke to change the Name of the Hero from <HI>Bilboa</HI> to BAYS, directly levelling his Bolt at Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>. It was brought upon the Stage in 1671, acted with universal Applause, and is the justest and truest Satire upon a vitiated and Dramatic Taste, the World ever saw; as it
<PB N="9" REF="13" MS="y"/>
will be an everlasting Proof of the Author's Wit and Judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, now making, among the <HI>Men</HI>, the foremost Figure in Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI>'s Company, he cast his Eyes on Mrs. <HI>Saunderson</HI>, who was no less eminent among the <HI>Women</HI>, and married her. She was bred in the House of the Patentee, im∣proved herself daily in her Profession, and having, by Nature, all the Accomplishments required to make a perfect Actress, she add∣ed to them the distinguishing Characteristick of a virtuous Life.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the Industry of the Patentee and Managers, it seems the KING's <HI>House</HI> then carried the Vogue of the Town, and the <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> Theatre be∣ing not so commodious, the Players and other Adventurers built a much more magni∣ficent one in <HI>Dorset-Gardens, Fleet-street</HI>, and adorned it with all the Machines and De∣corations the Skill of those Times could af∣ford. This likewise proving less effectual than they hoped, other Arts were employed, and the Political Maxim of DIVIDE &amp; IM∣PERA, (<HI>Divide</HI> and <HI>Govern</HI>) being put in prac∣tice, the Feuds and Animosities of the KING's <HI>Company</HI> were so well improved, as to pro∣duce an Union betwixt the two Patents. To bring this Design about, the following Agreement was executed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>If Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> shall hereafter be free to act at the DUKE's <HI>Theatre</HI>, this Agreement with him, as to his Pension, shall also cease.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> do <HI>Both</HI> also promise to promote with all their Power and Interest an Agreement between both Play∣houses; and Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> for himself, pro∣mises to endeavour, as much as he can, to get free, that he may act at the DUKE's Play∣house, but he is not obliged to play unless he have ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Day allowed for his Acting, and his Pension then to cease.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> promise to go to Law with Mr. <HI>Killigrew</HI> to have these Articles performed, and are to be at the Ex∣pence of the Suit.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. II. <HI>MEMOIRS of Mrs. BARRY</HI>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ELizabeth Barry</HI> was the Daughter of <HI>Robert Barry</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Barrister at Law; a Gentleman of an ancient Family, and good Estate.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of the Civil Wars, when King <HI>Charles</HI> invited all his Loyal Sub∣jects to take up Arms in his Defence, Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> raised a Regiment for his Majesty's Service, composed of his Neighbours and Tenants, equipping and maintaining them a considerable Time at his own Expence. This,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
as it ever after, made him known by the Title of Colonel <HI>Barry</HI>, it also so far incum∣bered his Estate, as to oblige his Children, when grown up, to make their own For∣tunes in the World.</P>
<P>The Lady <HI>D'Avenant</HI>, who had been se∣veral Years a Widow, and a particular Friend of Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI>, having the greatest Friendship for Col. <HI>Barry</HI>, took his Daughter, when young, and gave her a good Education. Lady <HI>D'Avenant</HI> made her not only her Companion, but carried her wherever she visited. Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> by frequently conver∣sing with Ladies of the first Rank and best Sense, became soon Mistress of that Behaviour which sets off the well-bred Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>What first recommended Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> to the Stage, was her Voice; her good Air, tho' no Beauty, made Sir <HI>William</HI> take her; but as she had a very bad Ear, they found it so diffi∣cult to teach her, that they thought it would be impossible to make her fit for the meanest Part. Three times she was rejected; and Three times, by the Interest of her Lady, they were prevailed on again to try her, but with so little Success, that several Persons of Wit and Quality being at the Play, and observing how ill she performed, positively gave their Opinion she never would be capable of any Part of Acting. But the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>, to shew them he had a Judgment superiour, entered into a Wager, that by proper Instruc∣tions, in less than six Months, he would en∣gage
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
she should be the finest Player on the Stage. He was opposed by them all, and tho' they knew him to be a Person of excellent Sense, yet they thought, on this Subject, he had started beyond the Bounds of his Judg∣ment; and so many poignant Things were said to him on this Occasion, that they piqued him into a Resolution of taking such Pains with Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, as to convince them he was not mistaken.</P>
<P>From the Moment he had this Dis∣pute, he became intimately acquainted with her, but to the World he kept it private, especially from those he had argued with about her. He soon, by talking with her, found her Mistress of exquisite Charms; and it was thought that he never loved any Person so sincerely as he did Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>. Whoever has a mind to see him in the Form of a Lover, may find him shine in the Letters annexed to his Poems (bound up with the Tragedy of <HI>Valentinian</HI>) Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> being the Person to whom those Letters were Addressed.</P>
<P>The first Parts Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> chose to teach Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, were the <HI>Little Gipsy</HI>, in the Co∣medy of the <HI>Rover</HI>, by Mrs. <HI>Behn:</HI> and <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>, the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Queen, in the Tragedy of <HI>Mustapha</HI>, by the E. of <HI>Orrery:</HI> which (besides the private Instructions he gave her) he made her Rehearse near 30 times on the Stage, and about 12 in the Dress she was to Act it in. He took such extraordinary Pains with her, as not to omit the least Look or Motion, nay,
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
I have been assured from those who were present, that her Page was taught to manage her Train, in such a Manner, so as to give each Movement a peculiar Grace.</P>
<P>But before I mention what Success the Peer had with his Pupil, to give the Reader a clearer Idea, it was certain Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> was Mistress of a very good Understanding, yet she having little, or no Ear for Music, which caused her to be thought dull when she was taught by the Actors, because she could not readily catch the Manner of their sound∣ing Words, but run into a Tone, the Fault of most young Players; this Defect my Lord perceiving, he made her enter into the Nature of each Sentiment; perfectly chang∣ing herself, as it were, into the Person, not merely by the proper Stress or Sounding of the Voice, but feeling really, and being in the Humour, the Person she represented, was supposed to be in.</P>
<P>As no Age ever produced a Person better skilled in the various Passions and Foibles of Mankind than my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI>, so none was more capable of instructing her to give those heightening Strokes which surprized and delighted all who saw her.</P>
<P>The first Night she played the <HI>Hungarian</HI> QUEEN, my Lord brought the <HI>King</HI>, and the <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Dutchess</HI> to the Play, besides the Persons he had disputed withal about her. The very Air she appeared with, in that di∣stressed Character, moved them with Pity,
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
preparing the Mind to greater Expectations, but when she spoke these Words to the in∣sulting Cardinal,
<Q><L>My Lord, my Sorrow seeks not your Relief;</L>
<L>You are not fit to judge a Mother's Grief:</L>
<L>You have no Child for an untimely Grave,</L>
<L>Nor can you lose what I desire to save.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here, Majesty distressed by the hostile Foe, the Widow Queen forlorn, insulted by her Sub∣jects, feeling all an afflicted Mother could suffer by a stern Counsellor's forcing her to yield her only Son to be sacrificed to the Enemy to save themselves and City, these Passions were so finely expressed by her, that the whole Theatre resounded with Applauses; the Dut∣chess of <HI>York</HI> was so pleased, that from Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> she learned to improve in the <HI>English</HI> Language, made her a Present of her Wed∣ding-Suit, and favoured her in so particular a Manner, not only whilst Dutchess, but when Queen, it is said, she gave Her her Coronation Robes to act Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, in the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>. In this Part, though the Play is but indifferently wrote, and stuft with Bombast, yet Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> so happily hit it, she made that Queen, which was so much beloved, re∣vive again, and become idolized in her: that little Speech of
<Q>What means my giving Subjects?</Q>
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
was spoken with such a Grace and Emphasis as was never before, or since, to be imitated; her Performance giving the Audience an Idea of that Princess in many important Passages of her Life. The Air with which she looked when she penetrated into the Thoughts of the Countesses of <HI>Rutland</HI> and <HI>Nottingham</HI> (on their endeavouring to hide the different Passions of <HI>Hate</HI> and <HI>Love</HI>) shewed, more than the Language, the piercing Genius of that great Lady; but when <HI>Cecil</HI> is recount∣ing the Seizure of the Earls, and mourns <HI>Essex</HI>'s fallen State, no Imagination can form, that has seen her Look, and Air, when she says
<Q><L><HI>Essex</HI> thou art fallen Indeed!</L>
<L>See! the Crocodile weeps over his Prey.</L></Q></P>
<P>As those who are acquainted with History know, that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> notwithstanding her Indulgence to her Favourites, had a quick Penetration into their Faults; so, it is cer∣tain, at the same time her Eyes flowed with Pity, for the Follies and Mismanagements which drew on their Fates. The Sword still executed Justice on the Traytors. This Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> represented so finely, that Love, Dis∣dain, Hate, Severity and Pity, were so blend∣ed together in this Politic Queen, one could not say which had the Mastery, and gave that Age greater Lights into Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI>'s Temper than History itself.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23"/><HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great:</HI> Or, <HI>The Rival Queens</HI>, was a Play in which Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> by her admirable Acting seemed to have new∣formed the Character; to read the Play one would think the Poet had been in a Rage the whole Time he was writing it, yet there are some Strokes in it which have the true Fire of Poetry. The Players, when this Tragedy first appeared, made it a Favourite one to the World, but for want of a <HI>Barry</HI> and a <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, the Characters of <HI>Roxana</HI> and <HI>Statira</HI> are perfect burlesque on the Dignity of Majesty, and good Manners. <HI>Roxana</HI> is haughty, malicious, insinuating; with this Compound, she is made desperately in Love with <HI>Alexander</HI>. On her first enter∣ing, what Misery did she seem to feel, tor∣tured with Jealousy, when she says,
<Q><L>Madness but meanly represents my Toil.</L>
<L><HI>Roxana</HI> and <HI>Statira!</HI> they are Names</L>
<L>That must for ever jar; eternal Discord,</L>
<L>Fury, Revenge, Disdain, and Indignation,</L>
<L>Tear my swoln Breast, make way for Fire and Tempest;</L>
<L>My Brain is burst, Debate and Reason quench'd,</L>
<L>The Storm is up, and my hot bleeding Heart,</L>
<L>Splits with the Rack.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have heard this Speech spoken in a Rage that run the Actor out of Breath; but Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> when she talked of her <HI>hot bleeding Heart</HI>, seemed to feel a Fever within, which
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
by <HI>Debate</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> she would <HI>quench</HI>. This was not done in a ranting Air, but as if she were strugling with her Passions, and trying to get the Mastery of them; a peculiar <HI>Smile</HI> she had, which made her look the most genteely malicious Person that can be imagin∣ed; when she meets <HI>Statira</HI> and insults her, in these Words:
<Q><L>I hope your Majesty will give me Leave</L>
<L>To wait you to the Grove, where you would grieve,</L>
<L>Where like the Turtle, you the Loss will moan</L>
<L>Of that dear Mate, and murmur all alone.</L></Q>
Then with what a Softness did she look and speak when she takes <HI>Alexander</HI> by the Hand, saying,
<Q><L>—now— for a last Look,</L>
<L>And that the Memory of <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Wrongs</L>
<L>May be for ever printed in your Mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the following Scene <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Cha∣racter rises; no Rage, no Revenge, nor even the Fear of <HI>Sysigambis</HI>, who by her Policies was suspected to aim at her, and the Infant's Destruction with which she was with Child, could make her admit a Thought against <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>'s Life, nay the Indignation she is in with <HI>Casander</HI> for tempting her, joined with his profered Love, is so great, that heightened at it, he is forced as in Astonishment, to sooth her Rage, and to contrive the getting <HI>Sta∣tira</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
into her Power. Once at the acting the last Scene of this Play Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> wounded Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> (who first played the Part of <HI>Statira</HI>) the Occasion of which I shall here recite.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> was likewise a very consi∣derable Actress; she was low of Stature, had very agreeable Features, a good Com∣plexion, but a Childish Look. Her Voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she generally acted the <HI>young Innocent Lady</HI> whom all the Heroes are mad in Love with; she was a Favourite of the Town; and, besides what she saved by Playing, the Generosity of some happy Lovers enabled her to quit the Stage before she grew old.</P>
<P>It happened these Two Persons before they appeared to the Audience, unfortunately had some Dispute about a <HI>Veil</HI> which Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> by the Partiality of the Property-Man ob∣tained; this offending the haughty <HI>Roxana</HI>, they had warm Disputes behind the Scenes, which spirited the Rivals with such a natu∣ral Resentment to each other, they were so violent in performing their Parts, and acted with such Vivacity, that <HI>Statira</HI> on hear∣ing the King was nigh, <HI>begs the Gods to help her for that Moment</HI>; on which <HI>Roxana</HI> hastening the designed Blow, struck with such Force, that tho' the Point of the Dagger was blunted, it made way through Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI>'s Stayes, and entered about a Quarter of an Inch in the Flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26"/>This Accident made a great Bustle in the House, and alarmed the Town; many differ∣ent Stories were told; some affirmed, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> was jealous of Mrs. <HI>Boutel</HI> and Lord <HI>Rochester</HI>, which made them suppose she did it with Design to destroy her; but by all that could be discovered on the strictest Exa∣mination of both Parties, it was only the <HI>Veil</HI> these two Ladies contended for, and Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> being warmed with Anger, in her Part, she struck the Dagger with less Caution, than at other times.</P>
<P>Tho' I have mentioned several Passages of this Play in which Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> shined, I cannot conclude without taking notice that tho' before our Eyes we had just seen <HI>Rox∣ana</HI> with such Malice murder an innocent Person, because better beloved than herself; yet, after <HI>Statira</HI> is dead, and <HI>Roxana</HI> is following <HI>Alexander</HI> on her Knees, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> made this Complaint in so Pathetic a Manner, as drew Tears from the greatest Part of the Audience,
<Q><L>O! speak not such harsh Words, my Royal Master:</L>
<L>But take, dear Sir, O! take me into Grace;</L>
<L>By the dear Babe, the Burden of my Womb,</L>
<L>That weighs me down when I would follow faster.</L>
<L>My Knees are weary, and my Force is spent;</L>
<L>O! do not frown, but clear that angry Brow;</L>
<L>Your Eyes will blast me, and your Words are Bolts</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="27"/>That strike me dead: the little Wretch I bear,</L>
<L>Leaps frighted at your Wrath, and dies within me.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here end the <HI>Memoirs</HI> communicated to us concerning Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>. But to the same Hand we are obliged for the following Account of that celebrated Actress, Mrs. MARSHALL.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>D'Avenant</HI>'s Company falling under Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Direction, as to the Women, he employed himself in visiting, and over∣looking their Actions as a Guardian, or Fa∣ther, and several Ladies so far busied them∣selves as often to enter into Quarrels with Nephews, Sons and Husbands, about attempt∣ing to corrupt them. The private Behaviour of these young Women were frequently talk∣ed of by the Ladies, extolling their virtuous Resistance of those dangerous Seducers, Man, to the Clouds; and comparing fallen Nymphs, with the Fiends sinking to the Shades below.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Betterton</HI>, encouraged by the Pub∣lic, joined with her own good Inclinations, trod the Stage without the least Re∣proach; but the first Thing that gave a Damp to these Endeavours, and caused her to find the guarding these Ladies Virtues a Task more laborious, and difficult, than any <HI>Hercules</HI> had imposed on him by his Step-Dame, was what happened to the famous Mrs. <HI>Marshall</HI>, more known by the Name of <HI>Roxalana</HI> from her Acting that Part. This Lady pos∣sessed
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
a Mind which shone with a haughty and severe Virtue according to the Haughtiness of that Age. She was attacked by, and had withstood the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AUBREY DE VERE.</NOTE> in every Form an artful Gallant could put on. Grown mad with Love, and her Repulses, he forms a Plot to get her by Force; intending to seize her as she went from the House after she had been acting this Part; which being made known to her, by some real Friend, she obtained a Party of the King's Guards to protect her. When her Chair appeared, the Nobleman began his Assault, but was valiantly repulsed, and she was safely conducted Home.</P>
<P>This Adventure was the whole Talk of the Court and Town; the Ladies applauded her Resolution secretly, not a little pleased to see their Sex's resolute Behaviour in <HI>Roxalana</HI>. Many Parties were formed both <HI>for</HI> and <HI>against</HI> her. The Fanatics cried out, saying, it was a Shame they should bring up Girls in the School of <HI>Venus</HI>, teaching them such Airs and Tricks to tempt Mankind. The Gentry liked the Diversion, alledging, the greater the Temp∣tation, the greater the Glory to resist, say∣ing that Ladies were bred up in virtuous Sentiments, their Minds improved by high Ideas, and encouraged by the Patronage of the Good and Great.</P>
<P>However, in this Affair, the King himself having the Story represented to him in the blackest Light, interposed; and his Majesty,
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
with a Freedom natural to one of the best tem∣pered Princes, told the Earl, he thought the Vice (though perhaps he gave too much Countenance to it by his own Irregularity) bad enough with the Consent of the <HI>Fair</HI>, but where Force or Violence was used, it was so heinous, he would not, though a Soveraign, indulge the Thought of such an Action, much more permit it to be done by a Subject.</P>
<P>This Reproof caused the Earl to answer with some Reserve, he said he would think no more of her; but soon after he renewed his Assault, telling her it was impossible to live without her. That, her exalted Virtue had inspired him with other Sentiments, propo∣sing to Marry her in private. This Bait <HI>Roxalana</HI> greedily swallowed, her Vanity inclining her to believe the Earl sincere. In short, the Earl comes, brings his Coachman dressed like a Minister, Marries her, and took her down to one of his Country-Seats, where soon growing weary of her, he pulled off the Mask, and, with Scorn, bid her return to the Stage. Upon this, she threw herself at the King's Feet, who coun∣tenanced her so far, that he made the Earl allow her 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; and, as long as her Son lived would not suffer him to Marry any other Lady; but, on the Child's Death, the Concern for so ancient a Family's becoming extinct (the Earl being the last of it) his Majesty through great Intercession was pre∣vailed on, to permit of the Earl's Re-Marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30"/>WE are, in this Place, obliged, in Justice to her Merit, to introduce, a Lady now living, Mrs. <HI>Anne Bracegirdle</HI>. She was the Daughter of <HI>Justinian Bracegirdle</HI> of <HI>Northamptonshire</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> where she was born.</P>
<P>It is not any Matter of our Enquiry by what Means a Gentlewoman of so good an Extraction came upon the Stage, since the best Families have been liable to the greatest Mis∣fortunes, amongst which was that of her Fa∣ther, in being bound, and suffering for Others. But it may be some kind of Alleviation to say, that in the Scene, wherein Providence had con∣signed her Fate, she had the good Fortune to be well placed, when an Infant, under the Care of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and his Wife, whose Ten∣derness she always acknowledges to have been Paternal; Nature formed her for the Stage, and it was to the Admiration of all Specta∣tors that she performed the Page in The <HI>Or∣phan</HI>, at the Duke's Theatre in <HI>Dorset-Gar∣den</HI>, before she was six Years old.</P>
<P>Here we must leave her for the present, and return to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>. For, with him, we must observe that the Disregard for the <HI>Tragic</HI> Poem, is at all times chiefly to be at∣tributed to a Defect in the <HI>Action</HI> when re∣presented on the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="31"/>Nor is there any greater Proof of the Vir∣tue or Corruption of the People, than their Pleasures. Thus in the Time of the Vigour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue, <HI>Tragedy</HI> was very much esteemed, its Dignity kept up, and the Decorum of the Stage so very nicely obser∣ved, that a <HI>Player's standing out of his Or∣der, or speaking a false Quantity, was suf∣ficient for him to be hissed off the Stage</HI>. This <HI>Cicero</HI> assures us, <HI>Histrio si paulo movit extra Numerum, aut si Versus pronunciatus est Syl∣laba una brevior aut longior exsibilatur &amp; exploditur</HI>. (Paradox iii.)</P>
<P>And when they gave us the most noble Examples of Virtue in their real Life, they were most pleased with the Representation of noble Examples on the Stage; for People are delighted with what bears the greatest Like∣ness to the Turn and Temperament of their own Minds. Thus when the <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue decayed, or indeed was lost with their Li∣berty, and they subsisted and spread their Dominions more by the Merit of their An∣cestors, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Name made terri∣ble by them, than by their own Bravery, then Effeminacy and Folly spread thro' the People, which immediately appeared in their Sports or Spectacles; and <HI>Tragedy</HI> was slighted.</P>
<P>Now Farce on the One hand, with its <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI>, and <HI>Opera</HI> on the Other, with its emasculating Sounds, invade and van∣quish the Stage, and draw the Ears and Eyes
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
of the People; who care only to laugh, or to see things extravagant and monstrous.</P>
<P>I rather at present attribute the Decay of <HI>Tragedy</HI> to our want of <HI>Tragedians</HI>, and in∣deed <HI>Tragic Poets</HI>, than to the Corruption of the People; which, tho' great enough, yet is not so desolate, as what we have mentioned in the <HI>Roman</HI> State.</P>
<P>I have often heard Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> say, that when he first Played under Sir <HI>Wil∣liam D'Avenant</HI>, the Company was much better regulated, and they were obliged to make their Study their Business, which our young Actors do not think it their Duty now to do; for they scarce ever mind a Word of their Parts but only at <HI>Rehearsals</HI>, and come thither too often scarce recovered from their last Night's Debauch; when the Mind is not very capable of meditating so calmly and judiciously on what they have to study, as to enter thoroughly into the Nature of the Part, or to consider the Variation of the Voice, Looks and Gestures which should give them their true Beauty, many of them thinking that making a Noise renders them agreeable to the Audience, because a few of the Upper Gallary clap the loud Efforts of their Lungs, in which their Understanding has no Share. They think it a superfluous Trouble to study real Excellence, which might rob them of what they fancy more, Midnight, or indeed whole Nights Debauches, and a lazy Remiss∣ness in their Business.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"/>Another Obstacle to the Improvement of our young Players, is, that when they have not been admitted above a Month or two into the Company, though their Education and former Business were ever so Foreign to <HI>Acting</HI>, they vainly imagine themselves Ma∣sters of an <HI>Art</HI>, which perfectly to attain, re∣quires a studious Application of a Man's whole Life. They take it therefore amiss to have the Poet give them any Instruction; and tho' they hardly know any thing of the Art of Poetry, will pass their Censure, and neglect or mind a Part as <HI>they</HI> think the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> and his Part deserves. Tho' in this they are led by Fancy as blind as Ignorance can make it; and so wandering without any cer∣tain Rule of Judgment, generally favour the bad, and slight the good. Whereas, said he, it has always been Mine and Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>'s Prac∣tice to consult even the most indifferent Poet in any Part we have thought fit to accept of; and I may say it of Her, she has often so ex∣erted herself in an indifferent Part, that her Acting has given Success in such Plays, as to read, would turn a Man's Stomach; and tho' I could never pretend to do so much Service that way, as She has done, yet I have never been wanting in my Endeavours. But while young Actors will think them∣selves Masters before they understand any one Point of their Art, and not give them∣selves Leisure and Time to study the <HI>Graces of</HI> ACTION <HI>and</HI> UTTERANCE, it is impossible
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
that the Stage should flourish and advance in Perfection.</P>
<P>Every one must be sensible of the Justness of these Sentiments, but some are apt to be∣lieve many of Them proceed from want of Judgment in the Managers, in admitting People unqualified by Nature, and not pro∣viding such Persons to direct them, as un∣derstand the Art they should be improved in. All other Arts People are taught by Masters skilful in them, but here Ignorance teaches itself, or rather confirms it self into the Confidence of Knowledge, by going on without any Rebuke.</P>
<P>From these Observations, and the instilling of them, into All under his Care, were owe∣ing that just <HI>Action</HI> which appeared on the <HI>Stage</HI> under Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Conduct.</P>
<P>We shall next give the Sentiments of a ri∣gid Critic upon the Action of that Period;
<Q>“Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> (says Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>) always pleases, and, what he delivers, every one takes up∣on Consent; their Eyes are prepossessed and charmed by his Action, before aught of the Poet's can approach their Ears; and to the most wretched of Characters he gives a Lustre and Brilliant, which dazzles the Sight, that the Deformities in the Poe∣”try cannot be perceived.</Q>

<P>He was brought into the Duke's Theatre to Sing at Seven Years old.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boman</HI> married <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, Daugh∣ter of Sir <HI>Francis Watson</HI>, Bart. She was born in the Parish of St. <HI>Martin</HI> in the <HI>Fields</HI> 1677, and was a very pretty Player both in her Person and Performances; particularly remarkable, for Acting the Part of <HI>Eurydice</HI> in OEDIPUS.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="36"/>That famous Comedian Mr. <HI>James Nokes</HI> was a Toyman in <HI>Cornhill</HI>. From his La∣bours on the Stage, he acquired and left to a Nephew at his Death, an Estate of 400 <HI>l. per Annum</HI>, at <HI>Totteridge</HI> near <HI>Barnet</HI>.</P>
<P>Upon his commencing Player, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second first discovered his Excellencies as he was Acting the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> in <HI>Shake∣speare</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Anthony Lee</HI> was of a good Family, and born in <HI>Northamptonshire</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>William Mountfort</HI> was a Gentleman descended of a very good Family. The first particular Notice taken of him on the Stage was in Acting the Part of <HI>Tall-Boy</HI>; soon after which his Salary was advanced; and he became more famous in Playing Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI>.</P>

<P>But this Chapter shall be concluded with a few Remarks, made by Mr <HI>Addison</HI>, rela∣ting to a very peculiar Player. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See GUARDIAN, Numb. 82.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. <HI>William Peer</HI> was an Actor at the Restoration, and took his Theatrical De∣gree with <HI>Betterton, Kynaston</HI> and <HI>Harris</HI>. Tho' his Station was humble, he performed it well; and the common Comparison with the Stage and Human Life which has been so often made, may well be brought out upon this Occasion. <HI>It is no matter</HI>, say the Moralists, <HI>whether you act a</HI> Prince,
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
<HI>or a</HI> Beggar, <HI>the Business is to do your Part ”well</HI>.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> distinguished himself parti∣cularly in <HI>Two</HI> Characters, which no <HI>Man</HI> ever could <HI>touch</HI> but himself; <HI>One</HI> of them was the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the <HI>Prologue</HI> to the <HI>Play</HI>, which is contrived in the Tragedy of HAM∣LET, to awake the Consciences of the Guilty Princes. Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> spoke this <HI>Prologue</HI> with such an <HI>Air</HI> as represented him an Actor, and with such an <HI>inferior manner</HI> as only <HI>act∣ing</HI> an <HI>Actor</HI>, as made the <HI>Others</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI> appear <HI>real</HI> great <HI>Persons</HI>, and not <HI>Representatives</HI>. This was a <HI>Nicety</HI> in <HI>Act∣ing</HI> that none but the most <HI>subtile Player</HI> could so much as conceive. I remember his speaking these Words, in which there is no great matter but in the <HI>right Adjustment</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> of the <HI>Speaker</HI>, with universal Ap∣plause.
<Q><L><HI>For</HI> Us, <HI>and for</HI> our Tragedy,</L>
<L>Here stooping to <HI>your Clemency</HI>,</L>
<L>We beg <HI>your hearing</HI> patiently.</L></Q>
<HI>Hamlet</HI> says very archly upon the pronoun∣cing of it, <HI>Is this a Prologue or a Poesie of a Ring?</HI> However the speaking of it got Mr. <HI>Peer</HI> more Reputation, than those who speak the Length of a Puritan's Sermon eve∣ry Night will ever attain to. Besides <HI>this</HI>, he got great Fame on <HI>another</HI> little Occasion. He played the Apothecary in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI>; it will be necessary to recite more
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
out of the Play than <HI>Peer</HI> spoke, to have a right Conception of what he did in it. <HI>Ro∣meo</HI>, weary of Life, recollects Means to be rid of it after this manner:
<Q><L>I do remember an Apothecary</L>
<L>That dwelt about this rendezvous of Death;</L>
<L>Meagre and very rueful were his Looks,</L>
<L>Sharp Misery had worn him to the Bones.</L></Q>
When this Spectre of Poverty appeared, <HI>Romeo</HI> addresses him thus;
<Q><L>I see Thou art very poor.</L>
<L>Thou may'st do any thing, here's fifty Drachmas,</L>
<L>Get me a Draught of what will soonest free</L>
<L>A Wretch from all his Cares.</L></Q>
When the Apothecary objects that it is un∣lawful, <HI>Romeo</HI> urges;
<Q><L>Art Thou so base and full of Wretchedness,</L>
<L>Yet fear'st to Die? Famine is in thy Cheeks,</L>
<L>Need and Oppression stareth in thy Eyes,</L>
<L>Contempt and Beggary hang on thy Back;</L>
<L>The World is not thy Friend, nor the World's Laws.</L>
<L>Then be not Poor, but break it, and take This.</L></Q>
Without these Quotations the Reader could not have a just Idea of the Visage and Man∣ner which <HI>Peer</HI> assumed, when in the most lamentable Tone imaginable; and delivering the Poison, like a Man reduced to the drink∣ing
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
it himself, if he did not vend it, says to <HI>Romeo</HI>,
<Q><L>My Poverty, but not my Will, consents.</L>
<L>Take this and drink it off, the Work is done.</L></Q></P>
<P>It was an odd Excellence, and a very par∣ticular Circumstance this of <HI>Peer</HI>'s, that his whole Action of Life depended upon speak∣ing <HI>five</HI> Lines better than any Man else.</P>

<P>FROM his very <HI>Name</HI> we may derive his <HI>Duty</HI>, he is called an <HI>Actor</HI>, and his Excellence consists in <HI>Acting</HI> and <HI>Speaking:</HI> The <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI> did all by Ge∣sture, and the Action of Hands, Legs and Feet, without making use of the Tongue in uttering any Sentiments or Sounds; so that they were something like our <HI>Dumb-Shows</HI>, with this Difference, one <HI>Pantomime</HI> ex∣pressed several Persons, and that to the Tunes of Musical Instruments. The <HI>Dumb-Shows</HI> made use of several Persons to express the
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
Design of the Play as a silent Action. The Nature of this is best seen in <HI>Hamlet</HI> before the Entrance of his <HI>Players</HI>.</P>
<Q>[Enter a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Queen</HI> very lovingly, the <HI>Queen</HI> embracing him; she kneels, and makes Shew of Protestation unto him; he takes her up, and reclines his Head on her Neck.

The <HI>Poisoner</HI> courts the Queen with Gifts; she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his Love.]</Q>
<P>I only repeat this to shew the manner of the old Time, and what they meant by Dumb-Shows, which <HI>Shakespeare</HI> himself condemns in this very Play, when <HI>Hamlet</HI> says to the <HI>Players</HI>,
<Q>“O! it offends me to the Soul to see a robustuous Perriwig-pated Fellow tear a Passion to Tatters, to very Rags, to split the Ears of the <HI>Ground∣lings</HI>, who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but <HI>inexplicable Dumb-Shows</HI> ”and Noise—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="42"/>But the <HI>Pantomimes</HI> or <HI>Roman Dancers</HI> expressed all this in one Person, as we have it in Mr. <HI>Mayne</HI>'s LUCIAN; where <HI>Demetrius</HI> the <HI>Cynic</HI> Philosopher railing against <HI>Dancing</HI>, is invited by one of them in the Time of <HI>Nero</HI>, to see him perform without either <HI>Pipe</HI> or <HI>Flute</HI>, and did so;
<Q>“for having imposed <HI>Silence</HI> on the Instruments, he by himself danced the Adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI>, the <HI>Sun</HI> betraying them, and <HI>Vulcan</HI> plot∣ing, and catching them in a Wire-Net; then every God, who was severally Specta∣tor; then <HI>Venus</HI> blushing, and <HI>Mars</HI> be∣seeching; in a Word, he Acted the whole Fable so well, that <HI>Demetrius</HI> much pleased with the Spectacle, as the greatest Praise that could be bestowed upon him, cryed out in a loud Voice, I <HI>hear</HI> my Friend, what you <HI>act</HI>; nor do I only <HI>see</HI> them, but methinks you <HI>speak</HI> with your ”Hands.</Q></P>
<P>This Instance not only shews the Differ∣ence between these <HI>Pantomimes</HI> from our old Dumb-Shows; but the Power of <HI>Action</HI>, which a <HI>Player</HI> ought to study with his ut∣most Application. The Orator at the Bar, and in the Pulpit, ought to understand the Art of Speaking perfectly well; but <HI>Action</HI> can never be in its Perfection but on the Stage, and in our Time the Pulpit and the Bar have left off even that graceful Action, which was necessary to the Business of those Places, and gave a just Weight and Grace to
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
the Words they uttered. And I wonder that our Clergy do not a little more consider this Point, and reflect, that they speak to the People as much as the Orators of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>; and what Influence Action had on them, will be evident from some Instances we shall give in their proper Places.</P>
<P>ACTION indeed has a natural Excellence in it, superior to all other Qualities; <HI>Action</HI> is <HI>Motion</HI>, and <HI>Motion</HI> is the Support of Na∣ture, which without it would again sink into the sluggish Mass of Chaos. <HI>Motion</HI> in the various and regular Dances of the Planets surprizes and delights: <HI>Life</HI> is <HI>Motion</HI>, and when that ceases, the human Body so beau∣tiful, nay, so divine when enlivened by <HI>Mo∣tion</HI>, becomes a dead and putrid Coarse, from which all turn their Eyes. The Eye is caught by any thing in <HI>Motion</HI>, but passes over the sluggish and motionless things as not the pleasing Object of its View.</P>
<P>This natural Power of <HI>Motion</HI> or <HI>Action</HI> is the Reason, that the Attention of the Au∣dience is fixed by any irregular or even fanta∣stic Action, on the Stage, of the most indif∣ferent Player; and supine and drowsy; when the best Actor speaks without the Addition of <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>It was the Skill the ancient Players of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> had in this, which made them not only so much admired by the Great Men of those Times and Places, but raised them to the Reputation of being Ma∣sters
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
of Two of the greatest Orators that <HI>Athens</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> ever saw; and who, had it not been for the Instructions of the Actors <HI>Satyrus, Roscius</HI> and <HI>Aesopus</HI>, had never been able to convey their admirable Parts to the World.</P>
<P><HI>Demosthenes</HI> being, after many successful Attempts, one Time exploded the Assembly, went Home with his Head muffled up in his Cloak, very much affected with the Dis∣grace; in this Condition <HI>Satyrus</HI> the Actor followed him, being his intimate Acquaint∣ance, and fell into Discourse with him. <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI> having bemoaned himself to him, told his Misfortune, that having been the most industrious of the Pleaders, and having spent almost the whole Strength and Vigour of his Body in that Employment, yet could he not render himself acceptable to the Peo∣ple; that Drunkards, Tarpaulins, Sots and illiterate Fellows, found so favourable a Hear∣ing, as to possess the Pulpit, while he him∣self was despised. What you say (replied <HI>Satyrus</HI>) is very true, but I will soon re∣move the Cause of all this, if you will re∣peat some Verses to me out of <HI>Sophocles</HI>, or <HI>Euripides</HI>. When <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had pronoun∣ced after his Way, <HI>Satyrus</HI> presently repeat∣ing the same Verses with their proper Tone, Mien and Gesture, gave such a Turn to them, that <HI>Demosthenes</HI> himself perceived they had quite another Appearance. By which being convinced how much Grace and
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
Ornament accrues to Speech by a proper and due Action, he began to think it of little Consequence for a Man to exercise himself in declaiming, if he neglected the just Pronunci∣ation or Decency of Speaking. Upon this he built himself a Place under Ground (which remained in the Time of <HI>Plutarch</HI>) whither he retired every Day to form his Action, and exercise his Voice. To shew what Pains this Great Man took, as an Example to our young Actors, who do not think themselves obliged to take any at all, I shall proceed with <HI>Plutarch</HI>. In his House he had a great Looking-Glass, before which he would stand and repeat his <HI>Orations</HI>, by that Means ob∣serving how far his <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI> were graceful or unbecoming.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Demosthenes</HI>, when a Client came to him on an Assault and Battery, he at large gave him an Account of what Blows he had received from his Adversary, but in so calm and unconcerned a Manner, that <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI> said, Surely, my good Friend, thou hast not suffered any one thing of what thou makest thy Complaint: Upon which his Client warmed, cryed aloud—<HI>How</HI>, Demos∣thenes? <HI>Have I suffered nothing?</HI> Ay marry, replies he, now I hear the Voice of a Man who has been injured and beaten. Of so great Consequence did he think the Tone and Ac∣tion of the Speaker towards the gaining Be∣lief.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46"/>This was the Case of <HI>Demosthenes</HI>, as <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI> assures us, and that of <HI>Cicero</HI> was not much different—At first (says <HI>Plutarch</HI>) he was, as well as <HI>Demosthenes</HI>, very defective in Action, and therefore he diligently applied himself to <HI>Roscius</HI> the <HI>Comedian</HI> sometimes, and sometimes to <HI>Aesopus</HI> the <HI>Tragedian</HI>. And such afterwards was the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Cicero</HI>, that it did not a little contribute to make his Eloquence persuasive; deriding the Rhetori∣cians of his Time, for delivering their <HI>Ora∣tions</HI> with so much Noise and Bawling, say∣ing, that it was their want of Ability to speak, which made them have Recourse to bellowing.</P>
<P>The same might be said to many of our bawling Actors, of which Number <HI>Aesopus</HI> was not, yet so possessed with his Part, that he took his acting to be so real, and not a Representation, that whilst he was on the Stage representing <HI>Atreus</HI> deliberating on the Revenge of <HI>Thyestes</HI>, he was so transported beyond himself, that he smote one of the Servants hastily crossing the Stage, and laid him dead on the Place.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>, in his <HI>Advancement of Learn∣ing</HI>, gives us a History from the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>Tacitus</HI>, of one <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, formerly an Actor on the Stage, but at that time a common Soldier in the <HI>Pannonian</HI> Garrisons; which is a wonderful Instance of the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Action</HI>, and what Force it adds to the Words. The Account is as follows,</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"/><HI>Vibulenus</HI>, on the Death of <HI>Augustus Cae∣sar</HI>, had raised a Mutiny, so that <HI>Blaesus</HI> the Lieutenant committed some of the Muti∣neers to Prison; but the Soldiers violently broke open the Prison-Gates, and set their Comrades at Liberty; and this <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, in a Tribunitial Speech to the Soldiers, begins in this manner—
<Q>“You have given Life and Light to these poor innocent Wretches— but who restores my Brother to me, or Life to my Brother? who was sent hither with a Message from the Legions of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> to treat of the common Cause; and this very last Night has he murdered him by some of his Gladiators, some of his Bravoes, whom he keeps about him to be the Murderers of the Soldiers. Answer, <HI>Blaesus</HI>, where hast thou thrown his Body; the most mortal Enemies deny not Burial to the dead Enemy: When to his Corps I have performed my last Duties in Kisses, and flowing Tears, command me to be slain at his Side, so that these our Fellow-Sol∣”diers may have leave to bury us.</Q></P>
<P>He put the Army into such a Ferment and Fury by this Speech, that if it had not immediately been made appear, there was no such Matter, and that he never had any Brother, the Soldiers would hardly have spared the Lieutenant's Life; for he acted as if it had been some Interlude on the Stage.</P>
<P>There is not so great a Pathos in the Words uttered by the Soldier, as to stir the
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
Army into so very great a Ferment, they must therefore receive almost their whole Force from a most moving and pathetic Ac∣tion, in which his Eyes, Hands and Voice joined in a most lively Expression of his Mi∣sery and of his Loss. It is true, that when an Army is tumultuous in itself, it is no dif∣ficult matter to run them into Madness; but then it must be done by some, who ei∣ther by their former Interest there, had pur∣chased an Opinion among them, or some one who by the Artfulness of his Address should touch their Souls, and so engage them to what he pleases. The latter I take to be our Case in <HI>Vibulenus</HI>, who by the Advantage of his Skill in Action recommended himself and his supposititious Cause so effectually to them, as to make the General run a great hazard of his Life for an imaginary Murder.</P>
<P>This has made some of the old Orators give the sole Power in <HI>Speech</HI> to <HI>Action</HI>, as I have read in some of those learned Men who have treated of this Subject in <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI>. And I am persuaded that the Clergy would move their Hearers far more, if they added but graceful <HI>Action</HI> to loud <HI>Speaking</HI>. This often sets off indifferent Mat∣ter, and makes a Man of little Skill in any other Part of Oratory, pass for the most eloquent; this, I have read, was the Case of <HI>Trachallus</HI>, who tho' none of the best Ora∣tors of his Time for the Composition and Writing-part, yet excelled all the Pleaders of
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
that Age, his Appearance and Delivery was so plausible and pleasing. The Stateliness of his Person and Port, the Sparkling of his Eyes, the Majesty of his Looks, the Beauty of his Mien and his <HI>Voice</HI>, added to these Qualities, which not only for Gra∣vity and Composedness came up to that of a <HI>Tragedian</HI>, but even excelled any Actors, that ever yet trod the Stage, as <HI>Quintilian</HI> assures us. <HI>Philistus</HI>, on the other hand, for want of these Advantages of Utterance, lost all the Beauty and Force of his Pleadings, tho for Language and the Art of Composition he excelled all the <HI>Greeks</HI> of his Time.</P>
<P>The same Advantage had <HI>Pericles</HI> and <HI>Hortensius</HI>, with this Difference, <HI>Hortensius</HI> ascribed all the Success of his Pleadings to the Merit of the Writing, and convinced the World of his Error by publishing his Ora∣tions; <HI>Pericles</HI>, tho' it is said he had the Goddess <HI>Persuasion</HI> on his Lips, and that he thundered and lightened in an Assembly, and made all <HI>Greece</HI> tremble when he spoke, yet would never publish any of his Orations, be∣cause their Excellency lay in the ACTION.</P>
<P>What I have said here of <HI>Action</HI> in ge∣neral, and the particular Examples I have given, is I believe sufficient to satisfy any one that is studious of Excellence on the Stage, that it ought to be his chief Aim and Application. But next to this is the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Speaking</HI>, in which also a Player ought to be perfectly skilled; for, as an eminent Writer
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
observes,
<Q>“The Operation of Speech is strong, not only for the Reason or Wit therein contained, but by its Sound. For in all good Speech there is a sort of Mu∣sic, with respect to its Measure, Time and Tune. Every well-measured Sentence is proportional Three Ways, in all its Parts to the Sentences, and to what it is intended to express, and all Words that have Time allowed to their Syllables, as is suitable to the Letters whereof they consist, and to the Order in which they stand in a Sen∣tence. Nor are Words without their Tune or Notes even in common Talk, which together compose that Tune, which is proper to every Sentence, and may be pricked down as well as any musical Tune: only in the Tunes of Speech the Notes have much less Variety, and have all a short Time. With respect also to Time and Measure, the Poetic is less various, and therefore less powerful, than that of Oratory; the former being like that of a short Country Song repeated to the End of the Poem, but that of <HI>Oratory</HI> is va∣ried all along, like the Divisions which a ”skilful Musician runs upon a Lute.</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to our former Consideration, saying,—
<Q>“The Behaviour and Gesture is also of Force; as in Oratory so in Con∣verse, consisting of almost as many Moti∣ons, as there are moveable Parts of the Body, all made with a certain agreeable
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
Measure between one another, and at the same time answerable to that of Speech, which when easy and unaffected is becom∣”ing.</Q></P>
<P>A Mastery in these Two Parts is what compleats an Actor: And I hope the Rules I shall give for both will be of Use to such as have truly a Genius for this <HI>Art</HI>; the Rules of which like those of <HI>Poetry</HI>, are only for those who have a Genius, and are not per∣fectly to be understood by those who have not.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with <HI>Action</HI>, the Player is to consider, that it is not every rude and undesigning <HI>Action</HI> which is his Business, for that is what the Ignorant as well as the Skil∣ful may have, nor can indeed want: But the Action of a Player is, what is agreeable to Personation, or the Subject he represents. Now what he represents is Man in his various Characters, Manner and Passions, and to these Heads he must adjust every Action; he must perfectly express the Quality and Man∣ners of the Man whose Person he assumes, that is, he must know how his Manners are compounded, and from thence know the se∣veral Features, as I may call them, of his Passions. A Patriot, a Prince, a Beggar, a Clown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must each have their Propriety, and Distinction in Action as well as Words and Language. An <HI>Actor</HI> therefore must vary with his Argument, that is, carry the Person in all his Manners and Qualities with
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
him in every Action and Passion; he must transform himself into every Person he repre∣sents, since he is to act all sorts of Actions and Passions. Sometimes he is to be a Lover, and know not only all the soft and tender Addresses of one, but what are proper to the Character of Him who is in Love, whether he be a Prince or a Peasant, a hot or fiery Man, or of more moderate and flegmatic Consti∣tution, and even the Degrees of the Passion he is possessed with. Sometimes he is to re∣present a choleric, hot and jealous Man; then he must be thoroughly acquainted with all the Motions and Sentiments productive of those Motions of the Feet, Hands and Looks of such a Person in such Circumstances. Some∣times he is a Person all dejected and bending under the Extremities of Grief and Sorrow; which changes the whole Form and Appear∣ance of him in the Representation, as it does really in Nature. Sometimes he is distract∣ed, and here Nature will teach him, that his Action has always something wild and irre∣gular, tho' even that regularly; that his Eyes, his Looks or Countenance, Motions of Body, Hands and Feet, be all of a Piece, and that he never falls into the indifferent State of Calmness and Unconcern. As he now represents <HI>Achilles</HI>, then <HI>Aeneas</HI>, another time <HI>Hamlet</HI>, then <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and <HI>Oedipus</HI>, he ought to know perfectly well the Characters of all these Heroes, the very same Passions differing in different Heroes as
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
their Characters differ: The Courage of <HI>Aeneas</HI>, for Example, of itself was sedate and temperate, and always attended with good Nature; that of <HI>Turnus</HI> joined with Fury, yet accompanied with Generosity and Greatness of Mind. The Valour of <HI>Mezen∣tius</HI> was savage and cruel; he has no Fury but Fierceness, which is not a Passion but Habit, and nothing but the Effect of Fury cooled into a very keen Hatred, and an in∣veterate Malice. <HI>Turnus</HI> seems to fight to appease his Anger, <HI>Mezentius</HI> to satisfy his Revenge, his Malice and barbarous Thirst of Blood. <HI>Turnus</HI> goes to the Field with Grief, which always attends Anger, where∣as <HI>Mezentius</HI> destroys with a barbarous Joy; he is so far from Fury, that he is hard to be provoked to common Anger; who calmly killing <HI>Ondes</HI>, grows but half angry at his Threats;
<Q>At whom <HI>Mezentius</HI> smil'd with mingled Ire.</Q>
Thus, it is plain, he has not the Fury of <HI>Turnus</HI>, but a Barbarity peculiar to himself, and a savage Fierceness, according to his Character, <HI>Virg.</HI> B. 10.</P>
<P>To know these different Characters of esta∣blished Heroes, the Actor need only be ac∣quainted with the Poets, who write of them; if the Poet who introduces them in his Play have not sufficiently distinguished them. But to know the different Compositions of the
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
Manners, and the Passions springing from those Manners, he ought to have an Insight into Moral Philosophy, for they produce va∣rious Appearances in the Looks and Actions, according to their various Mixtures. For that the very same Passion has various Appear∣ances, is plain from the History-Painters who have followed: Nature, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jordan</HI> of <HI>Antwerp</HI>, in a Piece of our Savi∣our's being taken from the Cross, which is now in his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Hands, the Passion of Grief is expressed with a won∣derful Variety; the Grief of the Virgin-Mo∣ther is in all the Extremity of Agony, that is consistent with Life; nay, indeed, that scarce leaves any Signs of remaining Life in her; that of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> is an extreme Grief, but mingled with Love and Tender∣ness, which she always expressed, after her Conversion, for our blessed Lord; then the Grief of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist is strong but manly, and mixed with the Tenderness of perfect Friendship; and, that of <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI>, suitable to his Years and Love for <HI>Christ</HI>, more solemn, more contracted in him∣self, yet forcing an Appearance in his Looks.</P>
<P><HI>Coypel</HI>'s Sacrifice of <HI>Jeptha</HI>'s Daughter has very luckily expressed a great Variety of this same Passion.</P>
<P>The <HI>History-Painters</HI> indeed have observed a Decorum in their Pieces, which wants to be introduced on our <HI>Stage</HI>; for they never place
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
any Person on the <HI>Cloth</HI>, who has not a Con∣cern in the <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>All the Slaves in <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s Tent of <HI>Darius</HI> participate of the grand Concern of <HI>Sisigambis, Statyra</HI>, &amp;c. This would render the Repre∣sentation extremely solemn and beautiful; but on the <HI>Stage</HI>, not only the Supernumera∣ries, as they call them, or Attendants, seem regardless of the great Concern of the <HI>Scene</HI>, and, even the <HI>Actors</HI> themselves, who are on the <HI>Stage</HI>, and not in the very principal Parts, will be whispering to one another, or bowing to their Friends in the Pit, or gazing about. But if they made Playing their Study, (or had indeed a Genius to the Art) as it is their Business, they would not only, not be guilty of these Absurdities, but would, like <HI>Le Brun</HI>, observe Nature wherever they found her offer any thing that could contribute to their Perfection. For this great Master was often seen to observe a Quarrel in the Street betwixt various People, and therein not only to regard the several Degrees of the Passions of Anger rising in the Fray, and their different Recess, but the distinct Expressions of it in every Face that was concerned.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Stage</HI>, indeed at the best, is but a very cold <HI>Representation</HI>, when supported by loud <HI>Prompting</HI>, to the great Disgust of the Au∣dience, and spoiling the Decorum of what is Represented; for an imperfect Actor af∣fronts the Audience, and betrays his own De∣merits. I must say this in the Praise of Ma∣jor
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
<HI>Mohun</HI>, he is generally perfect, and gives the Prompter little Trouble, and never wrongs the Poet by putting in any thing of his own; a Fault, which some applaud them∣selves for, tho' they deserve a severe Punish∣ment for their equal Folly and Impudence. They forget <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Advice to the Players. — <HI>Let those who play your Clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will of themselves laugh, to set on some Quantity of barren Spectators to laugh too; tho' in the mean time some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered. That's</HI> VILLAINOUS, <HI>and shews a most</HI> PITIFUL <HI>Ambition in the</HI> FOOL <HI>that uses it</HI>. This is too frequently done by some of our <HI>Comedians</HI>. But it is, I think, an unpardonable Fault in a <HI>Trage∣dian</HI>, who through his Imperfectness in his Part shall speak on, any Stuff that comes in his Head, which must infallibly prejudice the true Expression of the Business of the Play, let it be Passion, Description, or Narration. Tho' notwithstanding this Supinity in gene∣ral of too many of our modern Players, there are some among them who are in earnest; as may, from many Instances be pointed out in their respective Parts. Among those Players, who seem always to be in earnest, I must not omit the Principal, those incomparable Per∣formers Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>; their <HI>Action</HI> is always just, and produced naturally by the Sentiments of the Part they
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
Act, every where observing those Rules pre∣scribed to the Poets by <HI>Horace</HI>, and which equally reach the Players.</P>
<Q><L>We weep and laugh as we see others do,</L>
<L>He only makes me sad, who shews the way,</L>
<L>And first is sad himself; then <HI>Telephus</HI></L>
<L>I feel the Weight of your Calamities,</L>
<L>And fancy all your Miseries my own;</L>
<L>But if you ACT them ill! I sleep or laugh.</L>
<L>Your Look must alter as your Subject does,</L>
<L>From kind to fierce, from wanton to serene.</L>
<L>For Nature forms and softens us within,</L>
<L>And writes our Fortune's Changes in our Face.</L>
<L>Pleasure inchants, impetuous Rage transports,</L>
<L>And Grief dejects and wrings the tortur'd Soul;</L>
<L>And these are all interpreted by Speech.</L>
<L>But he, whose Words and Fortunes disagree</L>
<L>Absurd, unpity'd grows a public Jest.</L>
<BIBL>ROSCOM.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The Ladies just mentioned always entered into their Parts. How often have I heard Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> say, that she never spoke these Words in the <HI>Orphan,—Ah! poor</HI> CASTALIO!—without weeping. Nay, I have frequently observed her to change her Countenance several Times as the Discourse of <HI>others</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI> have af∣fected her in the Part she acted. This is be∣ing thoroughly concerned, this is to know one's Part, this is to express the Passions in the Countenance and Gesture.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58"/>The Stage ought to be the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>Passion</HI> in its various Kinds, and therefore the <HI>Actors</HI> ought to be thoroughly acquainted with the whole Nature of the Affections, and Habits of the Mind, or else they will never be able to express them justly in their Looks and Gestures, as well as in the Tone of their Voice, and Manner of Utterance. They must know them in their various Mixtures, as they are differently blended together in the different Characters they represent; and then that excellent Rule, in the <HI>Essay on Poetry</HI>, will be of equal Use to the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Player</HI>,

<HEAD>The following Letter is just come to our Hands, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the painful Warfare of a pub∣lic Life, Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI> hoped the Re∣mainder of it might have been passed in Si∣lence. But since she finds otherwise, and
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
that your <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI> is intended to do Honour both to the Dead and the Living, the following faithful Account of her is trans∣mitted, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Mary Porter</HI>, was the Daughter of Mr. <HI>Samuel Porter</HI>, but as she lost her Father too early to have any Knowledge of him, and being separated from her Mother when very young, she did not care to revive so ten∣der an Incident, as giving her the greatest Concern, being able to give no farther Ac∣count of a Parent than barely his Name.</P>
<P>Her Mother marrying Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> private∣ly, without her Parents Consent, her Father, Mr. <HI>Nicholas Mercator</HI>, being a <HI>German</HI>, and a Man of Letters, went, soon after his Daughter's Marriage, disgusted into <HI>France</HI>, and died there. He took with him all his Family except his New-married Daughter and his eldest Son, Mr. <HI>David Mercator</HI>, who was then one of the Clerks belonging to the Office of Ordnance in the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>. This Gentleman, after the Death of his Father, took care of his Niece without corresponding with his Sister. For which Reason Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Mother removed her from her Uncle, and put her into <HI>Bartholo∣mew</HI> Fair; where, the very first time of her Appearance, in Acting the Part of the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> took so great a liking to her, that, upon their Representation of her Performance, Mr. <HI>Bet∣terton</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
admitted her into the Theatre, and they treated her with the most tender Indul∣gence.</P>
<P>Our young <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> was boarded with Mrs. <HI>Smith</HI>, Sister to the Treasurer of the Playhouse, whose Care of her was Ma∣ternal, from the particular Recommendation of her Friends, more especially of Mrs. <HI>Brace∣girdle</HI>.</P>
<P>The Death of Mrs. <HI>Smith</HI>, in a few Years, and the Marriage of her Daughter, who was Miss <HI>Porter</HI>'s Companion, she being then not above fifteen Years of Age, yet thought it proper to take the Management of her Af∣fairs into her own Hands; and accordingly, as I have often heard her most gratefully ex∣press, discharged her Debts, tho' not her Ob∣ligations, to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>, for his Paternal Care of her.</P>
<P>The Veracity of these Informations, <HI>Sir</HI>, you may depend on, tho' coming from a Friend; for, as Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI> is not able to give a particular Account of her Family, so she would not by any means appear to be the Author of her own History.</P>
<P>Thus heartily wishing you Success in your present Undertaking, and all others, for the public Good, I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your most humble Servant</HI>, P. M.</SIGNED>
<DATE>June 24, 1736.</DATE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66"/>We find by this Letter, that the Pub∣lic stand indebted to Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, for this excellent Actress; the only living Ornament of the Tragic Scene.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion of a very good Judge of Dramatical Performers, that another Gen∣tlewoman, now living, was one of the great∣est, and most promising <HI>Genij</HI> of her Time. This was Mrs. <HI>Bradshaw</HI>, who was taken off the Stage, for her exemplary and prudent Conduct, by <HI>Martin Folkes</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Gentle∣man of a very considerable Estate, who mar∣ried her; and such has been her Behaviour to him, that there is not a more happy Couple. Mrs. <HI>Bradshaw</HI>, discoursing with a Friend, who was giving her some Instruc∣tions in her Profession, told him, that she did all in her Power to observe a Rule laid down by Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>,
<Q>“to make herself Mistress of her Part, and leave the <HI>Figure</HI> ”and <HI>Action</HI> to <HI>Nature</HI>.</Q>
Now tho' a great Genius may do this, yet <HI>Art</HI> must be consulted in the Study of the larger Share of the Professors of <HI>Oratory</HI>; for, as Mr. <HI>Bet∣terton</HI> most judiciously remarks, so great a Man as <HI>Demosthenes</HI> perfected himself by con∣sulting the Gracefulness of the Figure in his Glass: For to express Nature justly, one must be Master of Nature in all its Appear∣ances, which can only be drawn from Obser∣vation, which will tell us, that the Passions
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
and Habits of the Mind discover themselves in our Looks, Actions and Gestures.</P>
<P>Thus we find a <HI>rolling Eye</HI>, which is quick and inconstant in its Motion, argues a quick but light Wit; a hot and choleric Complex∣ion, with an inconstant and impatient Mind; and in a Woman it gives a strong Proof of Wantonness and Immodesty. Heavy dull Eyes, a dull Mind, and a Difficulty of Con∣ception. For this Reason we observe, that all or most People in Years, sick Men, and Persons of a flegmatic Constitution are slow in turning of their Eyes.</P>
<P>That extreme Propension to <HI>Winking</HI> in some Eyes, proceed from a Soul very subject to Fear, arguing a Weakness of Spirit, and a feeble Disposition of the Eye-lids.</P>
<P>A bold <HI>staring</HI> Eye, which fixes on a Man, proceeds either from a blockish Stupidity, as in Rusticks; Impudence, as in malicious Per∣sons; Prudence, as in those in Authority, or Incontinence, as in lewd Women.</P>
<P>Eyes <HI>inflamed</HI> and <HI>fiery</HI>, are the genuine Effect of Choler and Anger; Eyes quiet and calm with a secret kind of Grace and Plea∣santness are the Offspring of Love and Friendship.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Voice</HI>, when loud, discovers Wrath and Indignation of Mind, and a small trembling Voice proceeds from Fear.</P>
<P>In like manner, to use no <HI>Actions</HI> or <HI>Ge∣stures</HI> in Discourse, is a sign of a heavy and slow Disposition, as too much Gesticulation
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
proceeds from Lightness; and a Mean be∣twixt both is the Effect of Wisdom and Gra∣vity; and if it be not too quick, it denotes Magnanimity. Some are perpetually fidling about their Cloaths, so that they are scarce dressed till they go to Bed, which is an Ar∣gument of a childish and empty Mind.</P>
<P>Some cast their <HI>Heads</HI> from one side to the other wantonly and lightly, the true Effect of Folly and Inconstancy. Others think it essential to <HI>Prayer</HI>, to writh and wrest their Necks about, which is a Proof of Hypocrisy, Superstition or Foolishness. Some are wholly taken up in viewing themselves, the Proportion of their Limbs, Features of their Faces, and Gracefulness of Mien; which proceeds from Pride, and a vain Com∣plaisance in themselves; of this Number are Coquets.</P>
<P>In this manner we might examine all the natural Actions, which are to be found in Men of different Tempers. Yet not to dismiss the Point without a fuller Reflection, we shall here give the Signification of the Na∣tural Gestures from a <HI>Manuscript</HI> of a learn∣ed Jesuit who wrote on this Subject.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Passion</HI> or <HI>Emotion</HI> of the <HI>Mind, says he</HI>, has from Nature its peculiar and proper Countenance, Sound, and Gesture; and the whole Body of Man, all his Looks, and every Tone of his Voice, like Strings on an Instrument, receive their Sounds from the various Impulse of the Passions.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69"/>The <HI>Demission</HI> or <HI>hanging down of the Head</HI> is the Consequence of <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Sor∣row</HI>. And this therefore is a Posture and Manner observed in the Deprecations of the Divine Anger, and on such Occasions ought to be observed in the Imitations of those things.</P>
<P>A <HI>lifting</HI> or <HI>tossing up of the Head</HI> is the Gesture of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Arrogance</HI>. Carrying the <HI>Head aloft</HI> is the sign of Joy, Victory and Triumph.</P>
<P>A <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>bold Front</HI> or Forehead is looked on as a Mark of Obstinacy, Contu∣macy, Perfidiousness and Impudence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soul</HI> is the most visible in the <HI>Eyes</HI>, as being, according to some, the perfect Ima∣ges of the Mind; and as <HI>Pliny</HI> says, they burn, yet dissolve in Floods; they dart their Beams on Objects, and seem not to see them; and when we kiss the Eyes, we seem to touch the very Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Eyes lifted on high</HI>, shew Arrogance and Pride, but <HI>cast down</HI>, express Humbleness of Mind: Yet we lift up our Eyes when we address ourselves in Prayer to God, and ask any thing of him.</P>
<Q><P>Lifting in vain his burning Eyes to Heaven.</P>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>Denial, Aversion, Nauseating, Dissimula∣tion, and Neglect, are expressed by a turn∣ing away of the Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="70"/>A frequent <HI>Winking</HI>, or <HI>tremulous Motion</HI> of the <HI>Eyes</HI>, argues malicious Manners, and perverse and noxious Thought and Inclina∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>Eyes drowned in Tears</HI> discover the most vehement and cruel Grief, which is not capa∣ble of Ease even from Tears themselves.</P>
<P>To <HI>raise our Eyes</HI> to any Thing or Person, is an Argument of our Attention to them with Desire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hand</HI> put on the <HI>Mouth</HI> is a Token of Silence by Conviction, and is a Ceremony of the Heathen Adoration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Contraction</HI> of the <HI>Lips</HI>, and the <HI>scaunt Look</HI> of the <HI>Eyes</HI>, expresses the Ge∣sture of a deriding and malicious Person. Shewing the Teeth, and straitening the Lips on them, shews Indignation and Anger.</P>
<P><HI>Turning the whole Face to any thing</HI>, is the Gesture of Him, who attends and has a pe∣culiar Regard to that one thing. To bend the Countenance downward argues Conscious∣ness and Guilt; and, on the contrary, to lift up the Face is a Sign of a good Conscience or Innocence, Hope and Confidence.</P>
<P>The Countenance, indeed, is changed into many Forms, and is commonly the most cer∣tain Index of the Passions of the Mind. When it is pale it betrays Grief, Sorrow and Fear: and Envy, when it is very strong. A louring and dark Visage is the Index of Mi∣sery, Labour and vehement Agitations of the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="71"/>The <HI>Countenance</HI>, as <HI>Quintilian</HI> observes, is of very great Power and Force in all that we do. In this we discover when we are sup∣pliant, when menacing, when kind, when sorrowful, when merry; in this we are lifted up and cast down; on this Men depend, this they behold, and this they first take a View of before we speak; by this we love some, and hate others; and by this we understand a Multitude of things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arm extended and lifted up</HI>, signifies the Power of doing and accomplishing some∣thing; and is the Gesture of Authority, Vi∣gour and Victory. On the contrary, the hold∣ing your Arms close is a Sign of Bashfulness, Modesty and Diffidence.</P>
<P>As the Hands are the most habil Members of the Body, and the most easily turned to all Sides, so are they the Indexes of many Habits.</P>
<P>As we have two Hands, the Right and the Left, we sometimes make use of one, sometimes of the other, and sometimes of both, to express the Passion and Habit. The chief Forms of which I shall mention.</P>
<P><HI>Lifting of one Hand upright</HI>, or extending it, expresses Force, Vigour and Power. The Right Hand is also extended upwards as a Token of Swearing, or taking a solemn Oath; and this Extension of the Hand sometimes signifies Pacification, and Desire of Silence.</P>
<P><HI>Putting of the Hand to the Mouth</HI>, is the Habit of one that is silent, and acting Mo∣desty;
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
of Admiration and Consideration. The giving the Hand is a Gesture of striking a Bargain, confirming an Alliance, or of deli∣vering ones self into the Power of another. To take hold of the Hand of another ex∣presses Admonition, Exhortation and Encou∣ragement. The reaching out an Hand to another implies Help and Assistance. The lifting up both Hands on high is the Habit of one who implores, and expresses his Mi∣sery. And the lifting up of both Hands some∣times signifies Congratulation to Heaven for a Deliverance, as in <HI>Virgil</HI>;
<Q><L>His Hands, now free from Bands, he lifts on high,</L>
<L>In grateful Action to th' indulgent Gods.</L></Q></P>
<P>Holding the Hands in the Bosom is the Habit of the Idle and Negligent. Clap∣ping the Hands, among the <HI>Hebrews</HI>, signi∣fied deriding, insulting, and exploding; but among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI>, it was, on the contrary, the Expression of Applause. The Imposition of Hands signifies the im∣parting a Power in consecrating of Victims.</P>
<P><Q>“It is a difficult Matter, says <HI>Quintilian</HI>, to relate what a Number of Motions the Hands have, without which all Action would be maimed and lame, since these Motions are almost as various as the Words we speak. For the other Parts may be said to help a Man when he speaks, but the Hands (as I may say) speak themselves.
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
Do we not by the Hands desire a thing? Do we not by these promise? call? dis∣miss? threaten? act the Suppliant? ex∣press our Abomination or Abhorrence? our Fear? By these do we not ask Que∣stions? deny? shew our Joy, Grief, Doubt, Confession, Penitence, Moderation, Plenty, Number and Time? Do not the same Hands provoke, forbid, make Supplication, approve, admire, and express Shame? Do they not in shewing of Places and Persons, supply the Place of the Adverbs and Pro∣nouns? Insomuch that in so great a Variety or Diversity of the Tongues of all Nati∣ons, this seems to remain the universal ”Language common to all.</Q></P>
<P>It were to be wished that this Art were a little revived in our Age, when such useful Members, which of old contributed so much to the Expression of Words, should now puzzle our Players what to do with them, when they seldom or never add any Grace to the Action of the Body, and never almost any thing to the Explanation or fuller Ex∣pression of the Words and Passions. To pro∣ceed a little farther.—</P>
<P><HI>Stamping of the Feet</HI>, among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> signified Derision and Scoffing. Among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, &amp;c. Imperiousness. A constant and direct Foot, is the Index of a steady, certain, constant and right Study and Aim of our Designs.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74"/>On the contrary, <HI>Feet</HI>, full of Motion, are the Habit of the inconstant and fluctua∣ting in their Counsels and Resolves. And the <HI>Greeks</HI> thought this in Women a sign of a flagitious Temper.</P>
<P>Thus have I recited the <HI>Jesuit's</HI> Observa∣tions on the Gestures and Positions of the se∣veral Parts and Members of the Body. And tho' some of them may seem too particular, yet I am persuaded, that a Person of true Judg∣ment may find many Excellencies in them, which may afford him great Helps in the rendering his Gestures beautiful and expres∣sive. There is no greater Proof of this, than the Example I have already urged of The <HI>Pantomime</HI> and <HI>Demetrius</HI> the <HI>Cynic</HI> Philo∣sopher, who cried out to him, <HI>I hear, my Friend, what you act; nor do I only see them, but methinks you speak with your</HI> HANDS. But this Speaking with the Hands, (as it is here called) I find contain a great deal of the Representing of the Dancing Dumb-Shows of the <HI>Mimes</HI> and <HI>Pantomimes</HI>. It may be perhaps objected, that these Motions of the Hands were so well known to the Frequent∣ers of the Theatres, that, like our talking on our Fingers with those, who understand it, there would be no Difficulty in the Repre∣sentation; but that if any Stranger or Fo∣reigner should have been there, it would have been nothing but an unintelligible Gesticula∣tion, and what <HI>Shakespeare</HI> calls it, <HI>unexpli∣cable dumb Shews</HI>; whereas if these Actions
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
and Gestures were drawn from their Natural Significancy, according to those Marks I have already given, or others referred to by my Quotation of <HI>Quintilian</HI>, they must be intel∣ligible to all Nations, on first Sight to <HI>Bar∣barians</HI>, who never saw them before, as well as to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>, who conversed with them every Day.</P>
<P>I allow the Objection, but shall remove it by a farther Account of the very same <HI>Pan∣tomime</HI>, who lived in the Time of <HI>Nero:</HI> The Story is this—
<Q>“A <HI>Barbarian</HI> Prince who came from <HI>Pontus</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI>, on a Vi∣sit to <HI>Nero</HI>, among other Entertainments saw this <HI>Dancer</HI> personate so lively, that tho he knew nothing of what was sung, being half a <HI>Grecian</HI>, yet he understood all. Being therefore to return to his Coun∣try after this Entertainment of <HI>Nero</HI>'s, and bid ask what he would and it should be granted, replied, give me the <HI>Dancer</HI>, and you will infinitely oblige me. <HI>Nero</HI> ask∣ing him of what use he would be to him? My Neighbour <HI>Barbarians</HI> (says he) are of different Languages, nor is it easy for me to find Interpreters for them; this Fel∣low, therefore, as often as I have need, ”shall expound to me by his Gestures.</Q>
So clear and intelligible were his Actions and Gestures, and so derived from the Nature of the thing represented; which is a Proof, that there are certain Natural Significations of the Motions of the Hands, and other Members
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
of the Body, which are obvious to the Un∣derstanding of the sensible Men of all Na∣tions. If those which I have given you from my <HI>Jesuit</HI> be not, yet I am very sure, that many of them are explained by him, which will be plain to a serious Observer.</P>
<P>Gesture has therefore this Advantage above mere Speaking, that by this we are under∣stood by those of our own Language, but by Action and Gesture (I mean just and regular Action) we make our Thoughts and Passions intelligible to all Nations and Tongues. It is, as I have observed from <HI>Quintilian</HI>, the com∣mon Speech of all Mankind, which strikes our Understanding by our Eyes, as effectual∣ly as Speaking does by the Ears; nay, per∣haps, makes the more effectual Impression, that Sense being the most vivacious and touching, according to <HI>Horace</HI> in his <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI>;
<Q><L>But what we Hear moves less, than what we See;</L>
<L>Spectators only have their Eyes to Trust.</L>
<BIBL>ROSCOM.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I think we have already assigned tolerable Reasons why <HI>Movement</HI> and <HI>Action</HI> should teach us so sensibly; nay, the very Repre∣sentation of them in <HI>Painting</HI> often strikes the Passions, and makes Impressions on our Minds more strong and vivid, than all the Force of Words. The chief Work is cer∣tainly done by Speech in most other ways
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
of Public Discourse, either at the <HI>Bar</HI>, or in the <HI>Pulpit</HI>; where the Weight of the Reason and the Proof are first and most to be considered: But on the Stage, where the Pas∣sions are chiefly in View, the best <HI>Speaking</HI> destitute of <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI> (the Life of all Speaking) proves but a heavy, dull, and dead Discourse.</P>
<P>This, in some measure, will likewise reach all things delivered in Public, since we find <HI>Pliny the Younger</HI> talking of People in his Days reciting of their Speeches, or Poems, either by reading them themselves, or by ha∣ving them read by others, tell us, that this reading them was a very great Disadvantage to the Excellence of their Performance either way, lessening both their <HI>Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Cha∣racter</HI>, since the principal Helps of <HI>Pronun∣ciation</HI>, the <HI>Eyes</HI> and the <HI>Hands</HI>, could not perform their Office, being otherwise em∣ployed to read, and not adorn the Utterance with their proper Motions; insomuch that it was no manner of wonder, that the Attention of the Audience grew languid on so unactive an Entertainment. On the contrary, when any Discourse receives Force and Life, not only from the Propriety and Graces of speak∣ing agreeable to the Subject, but from a pro∣per <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI> for it, it is truly moving, penetrating, transporting; it has a Soul, it has Life, it has Vigour and Ener∣gy not to be resisted. For then the <HI>Player</HI>, the <HI>Preacher</HI> or <HI>Pleader</HI>, holds his Audience
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
by the Eyes, as well as Ears, and engrosses their Attention by a double Force. This seems to be well represented in some Words of <HI>Cicero</HI> to <HI>Caecilius</HI> a young Orator, in his first Cause, who would needs undertake the <HI>Action</HI> against <HI>Verres</HI>, in Opposition to <HI>Hor∣tensius</HI>. After he has shown his Incapacity in many Points to accuse <HI>Verres</HI>, both in Ability, and in not being free from a Suspi∣cion of a Share in the Guilt, he comes at last to the Power and Art of his Adversary. <HI>Hor∣tensius</HI>, says he, <HI>reflect, consider, again and again, what you are going to do! for there seems to me to be some Danger not only of his oppressing you with his Words, but even of his confounding and dazling the Eyes of your Understanding with his</HI> GESTURE, <HI>and the Motion of his Body, and so entirely drive you from your Design, and from all your Thoughts</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI>, in his Books of <HI>Oratory</HI>, tells us, that <HI>Crassus</HI> pleading against <HI>Brutus</HI>, deliver∣ed his Words with such an Accent and such a Gesture, that he perfectly consounded the latter, and put him out of Countenance, fix∣ing his Eyes stedfastly on him, and addres∣sing all his Action to him, as if he would devour him with a <HI>Look</HI> and a <HI>Word</HI>.</P>
<P>But to make these Motions of the Face and Hands easily understood, that is, useful in moving the Passions of the Auditors, or rather Spectators, they must be properly suited to the thing you speak of, your
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
Thoughts and Design; and always resembling the <HI>Passion</HI> you would express or excite. Thus you must never speak of mournful Things with a gay and brisk Look, nor <HI>affirm</HI> any thing with the Action of <HI>Denial</HI>; for that would make what you say of no manner of Authority or Credit; you would gain neither Belief nor Admiration. You must also have a peculiar Care of avoiding all manner of <HI>Affectation</HI> in your <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Gesture</HI>, for that is most commonly ridiculous and odious, unless where the Actor is to express some Af∣fectation in the Character he represents, as in <HI>Melantha</HI> in <HI>Marriage Ala-mode</HI>, and <HI>Mil∣limant</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World</HI>. But even then that very Affectation must be unaffected, as those two Parts were admirably performed by Mrs. <HI>Mountfort</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>. But your <HI>Action</HI> must appear purely natural, as the genuine Offspring of the things you express, and the <HI>Passion</HI> which moves you to speak in that manner.</P>
<P>In fine, the <HI>Player, Pleader</HI> or <HI>Preacher</HI> must have such nice Address in the Manage∣ment of his Gestures, that there may be no∣thing in all the various Motions and Disposi∣tions of his Body which may be offensive to the Eye of the Spectator; as well as nothing grating and disobliging to the Ears of his Au∣ditors, in his Pronunciation; else will his Person be less agreeable, and his Speech less efficacious to both, by wanting all that Grace, Virtue and Power it would otherwise obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="80"/>It is true, it must be confessed, that the Art of <HI>Gesture</HI> seems more difficult to be ob∣tained, than the Art of <HI>Speaking</HI>; because a Man's own Ear may be judge of the Voice and its several Variations, but cannot see his Face at all, and the Motion of the other Parts of the Body but very imperfectly. <HI>De∣mosthenes</HI>, as we have said, to make a true Judgment how far his Face and Limbs moved and kept to the Rules of good Action and Gesture, set before him a large <HI>Looking∣glass</HI> sufficient to represent the whole Body at one View, to direct him in distinguishing be∣twixt <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong</HI>, decent and indecent Actions; but yet, tho' this might not be unuseful, it lies under this Disadvantage, that it represents to the <HI>Right</HI> what is on the <HI>Left</HI>, and on the <HI>Left</HI> what is on the <HI>Right Hand</HI>; so that when you make a Motion with your <HI>Right Hand</HI>, the Reflection makes it seem as done by the <HI>Left</HI>, which confounds the <HI>Gesture</HI>, and gives it an aukward Ap∣pearance: But to rectify these erroneous Motions from the Glass, by changing Hands, might contract such an ill Habit, as ought with the utmost Caution to be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>Gesture</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI>, was never better ob∣served, than by that excellent Comedian Mr. <HI>Lacy</HI>. And in this very particular Action Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> used often to acknowledge his Obligations to Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of the <HI>Black Fry∣ars</HI> Company, and to Mr. <HI>Lowen</HI>, Sen. the

But here we must lament the great Loss our <HI>English</HI> Stage sustained in the untimely Death of Mr. <HI>William Betterton</HI>, who was drowned in swimming at <HI>Walling∣ford</HI> in <HI>Berkshire</HI>, otherwise the Merits of his Father might have longer continued amongst us.</P>
<P>We shall close this Chapter with the short Account left us of that memorable Comedian above mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Lacy</HI> was a Native of <HI>Yorkshire</HI>, born near <HI>Doncaster</HI>. He was bred in the Profession of a Dancing-Master, but pursuing some military Views, he became a Lieute∣nant and Quarter-Master under Colonel <HI>Ger∣rard</HI>. He was a well-shaped Man, of a no∣ble Stature, and justly proportioned. What brought him upon the Stage, we cannot determine; but a reputable Writer assures us, that, as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> has observed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Langhaine</HI>, in his Account of the Eng. Dram. Poets. Pag. 317.</NOTE>
<Q>“He was a Comedian whose Abilities in Action were sufficiently known to all who fre∣quented the King's Theatre. He per∣formed all the Parts he undertook to a Miracle, in so much that as the Age he lived in never had, so, I am apt to be∣lieve, no other will ever have his <HI>Equal</HI>,

at least not his <HI>Superiour</HI>. He was so well approved of by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. an un∣deniable Judge in Dramatic Arts, that he caused his Picture to be drawn in three Characters in one and the same Piece (<HI>viz.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The <HI>AMOUR</HI> of the Duchess of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Goodman,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> was Rival to Lord <HI>Buck∣hurst</HI>, and the KING, in the first Af∣fections of Mrs. <HI>Guyn</HI>; it likewise so hap∣pened, that Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> the Player, was another of his Majesty's Rivals in the Esteem of the Duchess of <HI>Cleveland</HI>.</P>
<P>The late famous Mrs. <HI>Manley</HI>, Author of the <HI>Atalantis</HI>, has in the Account of her Life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mrs. <HI>Manley</HI>'s Life, 8vo. p. 31, &amp;c. printed for <HI>E. Curll</HI>.</NOTE>, given a Relation of her Own Adven∣tures under the Name of <HI>Rivella</HI>, and drawn the Character of the Duchess of <HI>Cleveland</HI> under that of <HI>Hilaria</HI>. The Duchess was passionately fond of new Faces, of which Sex soever; and used a thousand Arguments to dissuade <HI>Rivella</HI> from wearing away her Bloom in Grief and Solitude. She read her learned Lectures upon the Ill-nature of the World, that would never restore a Woman's Reputation, how innocent soever she really were, if Appearances proved to be against her; therefore <HI>Hilaria</HI> gives <HI>Rivella</HI> this Advice, which she did not disdain to prac∣tice; <HI>viz. To make herself as happy as she could, without valuing or regretting those, by whom it was impossible to be valued</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84"/><HI>Rivella</HI> has often declared, that from <HI>Hi∣laria</HI> she received the first ill Impressions of Count <HI>Fortunatus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Late Duke of <HI>M</HI>******</NOTE> touching his Ingratitude, Immorality and Avarice; being herself an Eye-witness when he denied <HI>Hilaria</HI>, (who had given him Thousands) the common Civi∣lity of lending her Twenty Guineas at <HI>Bas∣set</HI>; which, together with betraying his Ma∣ster, and raising himself by his Sister's Dis∣honour, she had always esteemed a just and flaming Subject for <HI>Satire</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Rivella</HI> had now reigned six Months in <HI>Hilaria</HI>'s Favour, an Age to one of her in∣constant Temper; when that Lady found out a new Face, to which the old must give place; and such a one of whom she could not justly have any Jealousy in point of Youth or Agreeableness; the Person I speak of was the pretended Madam <HI>Beauclair</HI>, a Kitchen-Maid, married to her Master, who had been refuged with King <HI>James</HI> in <HI>France</HI>.</P>
<P>This pretended <HI>French</HI> Lady <HI>Beauclair</HI> plyed at Madam <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s Basset-Table, and was also of use to her in Love-Affairs.</P>
<P>As to the Character of <HI>Hilaria</HI>, she was Querilous, Fierce, Loquacious; excessively Fond, or infamously Rude: The Extreams of Prodigality, and Covetousness; of Love and Hatred; of Dotage and Aversion, were joined together in her Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="85"/>The whole Court and City knew that the Man <HI>Hilaria</HI> was in Love with was Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> the Player, for his fine Person and graceful Mien; he being the <HI>second</HI> Rival in the Favour of <HI>Two</HI> of the Royal Mistresses. As Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> equally cap∣tivated the Ladies on the Stage, it is not matter of any Admiration, that they should equally charm in more delightful Recesses: For,
<Q><L>In Love, and Death, such is the human Frame,</L>
<L>The Monarch and the Mimic are the same.</L></Q>
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has thus recorded <HI>Female Luxury</HI> and its Extravagancies; not forgetting <HI>Hi∣laria</HI>.</P>

<L>And Lands and Tenements go down her Throat.</L>

<P><HI>natural State</HI> and <HI>upright Position</HI>. In the Agitation indeed of a <HI>Passion</HI>, the Position will naturally follow the several Accesses and Recesses of the Passion whether <HI>Grief, Anger</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We must farther observe, that the Head must not be kept always like that of a Sta∣tue without Motion; nor must it on the con∣trary be moving perpetually, and always throwing itself about on every different Expression. It must therefore shun these ri∣diculous Extreams, turn gently on the Neck, as often as Occasion requires a Motion, ac∣cording to the Nature of the thing, turning now to one side, and then to another, and then return to such a decent Position, as your Voice may best be heard by all or the gene∣rality of the Audience. The Head ought always to be turned on the same Side, to which the <HI>Actions</HI> of the rest of the Body are directed, except when they are employed to express our Aversion to things, we refuse; or on Things we detest and abhor: For these Things we reject with the <HI>Right Hand</HI>, at the same time turning the Head away to the <HI>Left</HI>.</P>
<P>But the greatest Life and Grace of <HI>Action</HI> derive themselves from the <HI>Face</HI>. For this Reason, <HI>Crassus</HI> in <HI>Cicero</HI> remarks, that <HI>Ros∣cius</HI>, tho' so excellent a Player, lost his Ad∣miration among the <HI>Romans</HI> on the Stage, because the Masque he wore denied the Audi∣ence the Sight of those <HI>Motions</HI> and <HI>Attrac∣tive Charms</HI> which were to be discovered in
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
the Countenance. Some have been extremely surprized at the Ancients Use of those Masks on the Stage, which they called the <HI>Personae</HI>; nor is it easy to imagine how they were made, not to destroy that Grace and Beauty of Act∣ing in the Management of the Lineaments of the Face, which by all that we have of that kind must be entirely hid; and yet what <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI>, is a Proof, that the Players of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> were absolute Masters of Speaking and Action. It is true, there is much in the <HI>Voice</HI> to express the Passion artfully, yet certainly the several Figurations of the Countenance, as of the <HI>Eyes, Brow, Mouth</HI>, and the like, add the most touching and the most moving Beauties. But this Observation before men∣tioned sufficiently proves, that those were entirely lost by the <HI>Personae</HI>; which is a Proof, that in whatever they excelled our Actors, we have the Advantage in the mak∣ing the Representation perfect, by enjoying the Benefit of exposing all the Motions of the Face.</P>
<P>The Character which <HI>Lucian</HI> gives of those <HI>Personae</HI> makes them extremely ridiculous, and by his Description of the rest of the Tra∣gic Equipage, would make us very much doubt their Excellence in other Parts of Acting. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Mayne</HI>'s Translat. of <HI>Lucian</HI>.</NOTE>
<Q>“What a deformed and frightful Sight is it, to see a Man raised to a prodigious Length, stalking on exalted Buskins, his Face dis∣guised
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
with a grim Vizor, widely gaping, as if he meant to devour the Spectators; I forbear to speak of his stuffed Breasts and Fore-bellies, which make an adventitious and artificial Corpulency, lest his unnatu∣ral Length should carry a Disproportion to ”his Slenderness.</Q></P>
<P>Surely such a Figure as <HI>Lucian</HI> gives the <HI>Tragedian</HI>, must not only render him incapa∣ble of giving the Body all its just Motions and graceful Gestures, of which we are talk∣ing, and which the great Writers celebrate so much; but must be ridiculous to a Farce. But tho' what <HI>Lucian</HI> represents, may be looked upon as in the Time of the Corrup∣tion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Stage, yet the <HI>Cothurni</HI> and the <HI>Personae</HI> were in use among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, and must have been extremely preju∣dicial to the Beauty of the Representation. The Reason given for the first was the com∣mon Opinion, that the Heroes of former Times were larger and taller than our Cotem∣poraries; and it is probable that the first Use of the Vizor, which succeeded the besmeer∣ing the Face with Lees of Wine in the Time of <HI>Thespis</HI>, was chiefly to express the Looks and Countenance of the several Heroes repre∣sented, according to their Statues and Por∣traitures, which made the Players always new to the Audience; whereas we coming always on the Stage with the same Face, put a Force on the Imagination of the Audience to fancy us other than the same Persons. But
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
there is a Method, which, if maturely stu∣died, would obtain this Variety of Counte∣nance more artfully, and at the same time in∣spire the Actor better with the Nature and Genius of his Part. In a <HI>French</HI> Book writ∣ten by one <HI>Gafferel</HI> a Monk, he tells us, that when he was at <HI>Rome</HI> he went to see <HI>Campa∣nella</HI> in the <HI>Inquisition</HI>, and found him ma∣king abundance of Faces; which he at first imagined, proceeded from the Torments he had undergone; but he soon undeceived him by enquiring what sort of Countenance such a Cardinal had, to whom he had just before sent; for he was forming his Countenance, as much as he could, to what he knew of his, that he might know what his Answer would be.</P>
<P>If therefore a Player was acquainted with the Character of his Hero, so far as to have an Account of his Features and Looks, or of any one living of the same Character, he would not only vary his Face so much by that means, as to appear quite another Face, by raising, or falling, contracting, or ex∣tending the Brows; giving a brisk or sullen, sprightly or heavy Turn to his Eyes; shar∣pening or swelling his Nostrils, and the va∣rious Positions of his Mouth, which by Prac∣tice would grow familiar, and wonderfully improve the Art of Acting, and raise the no∣ble Diversion to greater Esteem. The study∣ing History-Painting would be very useful on this Occasion, because the Knowledge of
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
the Figure and Lineaments of the Persons re∣presented will teach the Actor to vary and change his Figure, which would make him not always the same in all Parts, but his very Countenance so changed, that they would not only have other Thoughts themselves, but raise others in the Audience. Some carry their Heads aloft and stately, others pucker their Brows, look with a piercing Eye; as we have said; and these things thoroughly considered by the Player, would in every Part make him a new Man; and with more Beauty supply the <HI>Personae</HI> of the Ancients, and raise our Stage to a greater Merit, than theirs could pretend to, which deprived the Audience of the noblest and most vivacious Part of the Representation, in the Loss of the Motions of the Face; of which we ought to take a peculiar Care, since it is on that, which the Audience or Spectators ge∣nerally fix their Eyes the whole Time of the Action.</P>
<P>Exercise and frequent Practice ought to reform the least Error in this Particular, be∣cause in the Performance every one presently discovers it, tho' the Actor sees it not him∣self. The surest Way of correcting this is either a Looking-Glass, or a judicious Friend, who can and will let you know what Coun∣tenance is agreeable, and what the contrary. But this is a general Rule, without any Ex∣ception, that you adjust all the Lines and Motions of the Face to the Subject of your
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
Discourse, the Passion you feel within you, or should according to your Part feel, or would raise in those who hear and see you. You must likewise consider the Quality you repre∣sent, as well as the Quality of those to whom you speak; for even in great Degrees of the Passions the Difference and Distance of that has a greater or less Awe upon the very Ap∣pearance of the Passion. The <HI>Countenance</HI> must be brightened with a pleasant Gayety on things that are agreeable, and that ac∣cording to the Degrees of their being so; and likewise in <HI>Joy</HI>, which must still be heighten∣ed in the Passion of <HI>Love</HI>; tho' indeed the <HI>Countenance</HI> in the Expression of this Passion is extremely various, participating sometimes of the Transports of Joy, sometimes of the Agonies of Grief; it is sometimes mingled with the Heats of Anger, and sometimes smiles with all the pleasing Tranquility of an equal Joy. Sadness or Gravity must pre∣vail in the <HI>Countenance</HI>, when the Subject is grave, melancholy or sorrowful; and Grief is to be expressed according to its various De∣grees of Violence. <HI>Hate</HI> has its peculiar Ex∣pression composed of <HI>Grief, Envy</HI> and <HI>Anger</HI>, a Mixture of all which ought to appear in the Eye. When you bring or offer <HI>Com∣fort</HI>, Mildness and Affability ought to be seen in your <HI>Countenance</HI>, as <HI>Severity</HI> should, when you censure or reprehend.</P>
<P>It is not in the least to be doubted, but that several other <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
have taken their Turns among the <HI>Court-Ladies</HI>, as well as Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> and Mr. <HI>Good∣man</HI>. However, we shall drop that En∣quiry, and resume the Subject of their The∣atrical Excellencies.</P>
<P>I have heard Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> mention these Parts as some of Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>'s shining Charac∣ters; <HI>Arbaces</HI>, in <HI>King and no King. Amin∣tor</HI>, in the <HI>Maid's Tragedy. Rollo</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy. Brutus</HI>, in <HI>Julius Caesar. O∣thello</HI> and <HI>Alexander the Great</HI>. In this last Character he appeared with such Majesty in his Looks and Gesture, that a Courtier of the first Rank was pleased to honour him with this Commendation, <HI>Hart</HI>, says he, <HI>might teach any King on Earth how to com∣port himself</HI>. He was no less inferior in Co∣medy. In the Parts of <HI>Mosca</HI> in <HI>Volpone</HI>, Don <HI>John</HI> in the <HI>Chances, Wildblood</HI> in the <HI>Mock-Astrologer</HI>, &amp;c. In all the Tragic and Comic Parts he performed, he arrived to a Pitch not equalled by any of his Cotempo∣raries, nor attainable by his Successors. But Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, and Major <HI>Mohun</HI> may be said to have been the Two SOCIAS. <HI>Par No∣bile Fratrum</HI> as to their Justness of Acting. The latter shone in the Parts of <HI>Volpone. Face</HI> in the <HI>Alchymist. Melantius</HI> in the <HI>Maid's Tragedy. Mordonius</HI> in <HI>King and no King. Cassius</HI> in <HI>Julius Caesar. Clytus</HI> in <HI>Alexan∣der the Great. Mithridates</HI> King of <HI>Pontus</HI>, in performing which Part, Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> cried out, in the greatest Extacy, O <HI>Mohun, Mohun!
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
Thou little Man of Mettle, were I to write a hundred Plays thou should'st be in 'em all</HI>.</P>
<P>Many were the good Actors of those Days, whose Excellencies to enumerate would be an endless Task, for which reason it is sufficient to have mentioned some of the Principal. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> likewise succeeded in Major <HI>Mo∣hun</HI>'s Parts.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kynaston</HI> was so famous for <HI>Womens Parts</HI>, that he played <HI>Arthiope</HI>, in the <HI>Un∣fortunate Lovers</HI>. The <HI>Princess</HI> in the <HI>Mad Lover. Ismenia</HI> in the <HI>Maid</HI> in the <HI>Mill. Aglaura</HI>, &amp;c. being Parts so greatly moving Compassion, that it has been disputed among the Judicious, whether any <HI>Woman</HI> could have more sensibly touched the Passions.</P>
<P>The Play called <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI>, written by Sir <HI>William D'Avenant</HI>, was Acted be∣fore the Court, and very richly Drest. The King gave Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, who played Prince <HI>Alvaro</HI>, his Coronation Suit. And to Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>, who played Prince <HI>Prospero</HI>, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> gave his Suit. And to Mr. <HI>Price</HI> who acted <HI>Lionel</HI> Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>, the Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> gave his Cloaths. Mrs. <HI>Daven∣port</HI> an excellent Actress played <HI>Evandra</HI>.</P>
<P>A short time afterwards Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Harris</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Price</HI>, all appeared again, in the Revival of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI>, when a very merry Incident happened. There being a Fight in this Play between the House of <HI>Capulet</HI> and the House of <HI>Paris</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Holden</HI>, a good Actress, who
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
was the Wife of <HI>Paris</HI>, entering in a violent Hurry, and crying out, <HI>O my dear Count</HI>, inadvertently omitted the Letter <HI>o</HI>, and lay∣ing a vehement Accent on the Word, put the House into the loudest Fit of Laughter and Merriment.</P>
<P>Among the many fine Players of this Age Mr. <HI>Sandford</HI> must be remembred, and sor∣ry we are, that we can obtain no other No∣tices of him than what we find among the <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI> prefixed to the Plays wherein he acted.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> brought three Plays, him∣self, upon the Stage.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Woman</HI> made a <HI>Justice</HI>. In this Comedy Mrs. <HI>Long</HI>, a fine Actress, played the Part of the Justice.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Unjust Judge:</HI> Or, <HI>Appius</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI>. A Tragedy. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> played <HI>Virginius</HI>, and his Wife <HI>Virginia</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Amorous Widow:</HI> Or, The <HI>Wanton Wife</HI>. In this Comedy Mr. <HI>Nokes</HI> played Sir <HI>Barnaby Brittle</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Long</HI> Mrs. <HI>Brittle</HI>, in which Part Mrs. <HI>Brace∣girdle</HI> succeeded her.</P>
<P>All these Plays were well received; but the <HI>Last</HI> only is preserved, the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Se∣cond</HI> being lost.</P>
<P>We must here observe, that notwithstand∣ing Mr. <HI>Otway</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> had very strong Inclinations to come upon the Stage, yet both these Gentlemen found Writing and Playing
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
so widely different, that they were each of them dashed in their first Attempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stage</HI> having worn out the Reign of its Royal Master King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> having undergone the Grand <HI>Revolu∣tion</HI> occasioned by the Abdication of King <HI>James</HI>, we shall now give an Account of the State of the Theatre under King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>.</P>
<P>A great Difference happening between the United Patentees of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Companies after the <HI>Revolu∣tion</HI>, the chief Actors, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and his Friends, together with Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle, &amp;c.</HI> Represented the great Oppression they lay under, in a Petition to the Right Honourable <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Dor∣set</HI>, &amp;c. then Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold. This generous Nobleman believ∣ing their Complaints to be just, did, with the Assistance of Sir <HI>Robert Howard</HI>, procure for them of their Majesties a separate License, constituting Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> Patentees. By this Authority they formed a select Com∣pany, and Metamorphosing the <HI>Tennis-Court</HI> in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</HI>, opened their new Theatre the last Day of <HI>April</HI> 1695, with a Comedy written by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> called, <HI>Love for Love</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Company were Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>, Mr. <HI>Sandford</HI>, Mr. <HI>Underhill</HI>, Mr. <HI>Dogget</HI>, Mr. <HI>Verbrugegen</HI>, Mr. <HI>Powell</HI>, Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI>,

Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>, Mr. <HI>Penkethman</HI>, Mr. <HI>Bullock</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We shall, for some time, leave these Gen∣tlemen in the Discharge of their Profession, and resume the farther Instructions of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> for attaining the <HI>Oratory</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI>, the <HI>Bar</HI>, and the <HI>Pulpit</HI>.</P>
<P>The Management of the <HI>Eyes</HI> in an <HI>Ora∣tor</HI> at the <HI>Bar</HI>, or in the <HI>Pulpit</HI>, seems something different from what they must be in a <HI>Player</HI>, tho' if we make the rest of the <HI>Actors</HI> on the <HI>Stage</HI> with him at the same time, his Auditors, the Rules for <HI>one</HI> will reach the <HI>other</HI>; for so indeed they are, for all the Regard that is to be had to the Au∣dience is that they see and hear distinctly, what we act and what we speak; that they may judge justly of our Positions, Gestures and Utterance, in regard to each other.</P>
<P>The Orator therefore must always be cast∣ing his Eyes on some or other of his Audi∣tors, and turning them gently from side to side with an Air of Regard, sometimes on one Person, and sometimes on another, and not fix them immoveably on one Part of the Audience, which is extremely unaffecting and dull, much less moving, than when we look them decently in the Face, as in common Dis∣course. This will hold good in <HI>Playing</HI>, if applied according to my former Rule; for in∣deed I have observed frequently some Play∣ers, who pass for great ones, have their Eyes lifted up to the Galleries, or Top of the
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
House, when they are engaged in a Discourse of some Heat, as if indeed they were con∣ning a Lesson, not acting a Part. <HI>Theophra∣stus</HI> himself condemned <HI>Tamariscus</HI>, a <HI>Player</HI> of his Time, who, whenever he spoke on the Stage, turned his Eyes from those who were to hear him, and kept them fixt all the while on one single and insensible Object. But Na∣ture acts directly in a contrary manner, and yet she ought to be the Player's as well as the Poet's Mistress. No Man is engaged in Dispute, or any Argument of Moment, but his Eyes and all his Regard are fixt on the Person he talks with; not but that there are Times according to the Turn or Crisis of a Passion, where the Eyes may with great Beauty be turned from the Object we address to several Ways, as in Appeals to Heaven, imploring Assistance, to join in your Addres∣ses to any one, and the like.</P>
<P>When we are free from Passion, and in any Discourse which requires no great Motion, as our modern Tragedies too frequently suffer their chief Parts to be, our Aspect should be pleasant, our Looks direct, neither severe nor aside, unless we fall into a Passion, which requires the contrary. For then Nature, if we obey her Summons, will alter our Looks and Gestures. Thus when a Man speaks in <HI>Anger</HI>, his Imagination is inflamed, and kin∣dles a sort of Fire in his Eyes, which spar∣kles from them in such a manner, that a Stranger, who understood not a Word of the
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
Language, or a deaf Man, who could not hear the loudest Tone of his Voice, would not fail of perceiving his Fury and Indignation. And this Fire of their Eyes will easily strike those of their Audience which are continually fixt on yours; and by a strange sympathetic In∣fection, it will set them on fire too with the very same Passion.</P>
<P>I would not be misunderstood, when I say you must wholly place your Eyes on the Person or Persons you are engaged with on the Stage; I mean, that at the same time both Parties keep such a Position in regard of the Audience, that even these Beauties escape not their Observation, tho' never so justly directed. As in a Piece of History-Painting, tho' the Figures fix their Eyes ever so directly to each other, yet the Beholder, by the Advantage of their Position, has a full View of the Expression of the Soul in the Eyes of the Figures.</P>
<P>The Looks and just Expression of all the other Passions has the same Effect, as this we have mentioned of Anger For if the <HI>Grief</HI> of another touches you with a real Compas∣sion, Tears will flow from your Eyes, whe∣ther you will or not. And this Art of Weep∣ing was studied with great Application by the ancient Players; and they made so extra∣ordinary a Progress in it, and worked the Counterfeit so near a Reality, that their Faces used to be all over bedewed with Tears when they came off the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="101"/>They were likewise so much affected by acting these mournful Parts, that they for some time, when off the Stage, seemed, as I have ob∣served, struck by a real Sorrow to the Heart.</P>
<P>This Behaviour justifies what the Antients practised in heightning their Theatrical Sor∣row, by fixing the Mind on real Objects; or by working the Actor up by a strong Imagination, that he is the very Person, and in the very same Circumstances, which will make the Case so very much his own, that he will not want Fire in Anger, nor Tears in Grief: And then he need not fear affecting the Audience; for Pas∣sions are wonderfully conveyed; the Tears of <HI>one</HI> melting the Heart of the <HI>other</HI>, by a very visible Sympathy between their Imaginations and Aspects.</P>
<P>You must lift up, or cast down, your Eyes, according to the Nature of the Things you speak of: Thus if of <HI>Heaven</HI>, your Eyes natur∣ally are lifted up; if of <HI>Earth</HI>, or <HI>Hell</HI>, or any thing Terrestrial, they are as naturally cast down. Your Eyes must also be directed ac∣cording to the Passions; as to deject them on Things of Disgrace, and which you are asham'd of; and raise them on Things of Honour, which you can glory in with Confidence and Reputa∣tion. In Swearing, or taking a solemn Oath, or Attestation of any Thing, to the Verity of what you say, you turn your Eyes, and in the same Action lift up your Hand to the Thing you swear by, or attest.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102"/>Your Eye-brows must neither be immove∣able, nor always in Motion: Nor must they both be rais'd on every thing that is spoken with Eagerness and Consent; and much less must one be rais'd, and the other cast down; but generally they must remain in the same Posture and Equality, which they have by Na∣ture, allowing them their due Motion when the Passions require it; that is, to contract them∣selves, and frown in <HI>Sorrow</HI>; to smooth and di∣late themselves in <HI>Joy</HI>; to hang down in <HI>Hu∣mility</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mouth</HI> must never be writh'd, nor the <HI>Lips</HI> bit or lick'd, which are all ungenteel and unmannerly Actions, and yet what some are frequently guilty of; yet in some Efforts or Starts of Passion, the Lips have their Share of Action, but this more on-the Stage, than in any other public Speaking, either in the Pul∣pit, or at the Bar; because the Stage is, or ought to be, an Imitation of Nature in those Actions and Discourses, which are produced betwixt Man and Man by any Passion, or on any Busi∣ness, which can afford Action; for all other has in reality nothing to do with the <HI>Scene</HI>.</P>
<P>Tho' to shrug up the Shoulders be no Gesture allow'd in Oratory, yet on the Stage the Cha∣racter of the Person, and the Subject of his Discourse, may render it proper enough; tho' I confess, it seems more adapted to Come∣dy, than Tragedy, where all should be great and solemn, and with which the gravest of the
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
Orators Actions will agree. I have read of a pleasant Method, that <HI>Demosthenes</HI> took to cure himself of this Vice of Action, for he at first was mightily given to it: He used to exercise him∣self in declaiming in a narrow and streight Place, with a Dagger hung just over his Shoul∣ders; so that as often as he shrugg'd them up, the Point, by pricking his Shoulders, put him in mind of his Error; which in time remov'd the Defect.</P>
<P>Others thrust out the Belly, and throw back the Head, both Gestures unbecoming and in∣decent.</P>
<P>We come now to the Hands, which, as they are the chief Instruments of Action, varying themselves as many Ways, as they are capable of expressing Things, so is it a difficult Matter to give such Rules as are without Exception. Those Natural Significations of particular Ge∣stures, and what I shall here add, will, I hope, be some Light to the young Actor in this Particular. First, I would have him re∣gard the <HI>Action</HI> of the Hands, as to their Expression of <HI>Accusation, Deprecation, Threats, Desire</HI>, &amp;c. and to weigh well what those Actions are, and in what manner expressed; and then considering how large a Share those Actions have in all Manner of Discourse, he will find that his Hands need never be idle, or employed in an insignificant or unbeautiful Gesture.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104"/>In the Beginning of a solemn Speech, or O∣ration, as in that of <HI>Anthony</HI> on the Death of <HI>Caesar</HI>, or of <HI>Brutus</HI> on the same Occasion, there is no Gesture, at least of any Considerati∣on, unless it begin abruptly, as <HI>O</HI> JUPITER, <HI>O Heav'ns! is this to be borne? the very Ships then in our Eyes, which I preserv'd</HI>, &amp;c. extending here his Hands first to <HI>Heaven</HI>, and then to the Ships. In all regular Gestures of the Hands, they ought perfectly to correspond with one another; as in starting in a Maze, on a sudden Fright, as <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Scene betwixt him and his Mother, on the Appearance of his Father's Ghost —
<Q><L>Save me, and hover o'er me with your Wings,</L>
<L>You Heavenly Guards!</L></Q></P>
<P>This is spoke with Arms and Hands extend∣ed, and expressing his Concern, as well as his <HI>Eyes</HI>, and <HI>whole Face</HI>. If an Action comes to be used by only one Hand, that must be by the <HI>Right</HI>, it being indecent to make a Ges∣ture with the <HI>Left</HI> alone; except you should say any such thing as,
<Q><L>Rather than be guilty of so foul a Deed,</L>
<L>I'd cut this Right Hand off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>For here the Actions must be expressed by the <HI>Left</HI> Hand, because the <HI>Right</HI> is the Mem∣ber to suffer. When you speak of yourself,
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
the <HI>Right</HI> not the <HI>Left</HI> Hand must be apply'd to the Bosom, declaring your own Faculties, and Passions; your Heart, your Soul, or your Con∣science: But this Action, generally speaking, should be only apply'd or express'd by laying the Hand gently on the Breast, and not by thumping it as some People do. The Ges∣ture must pass from the <HI>Left</HI> to the <HI>Right</HI>, and there end with Gentleness and Moderation, at least not stretch to the Extremity of Vio∣lence. You must be sure, as you begin your Action with what you say, so you must end it when you have done speaking; for Action either before or after Utterance is highly ridi∣culous. The Movement or Gestures of your Hands must always be agreeable to the Na∣ture of the Words, that you speak; for when you say <HI>Come in</HI>, or <HI>Approach</HI>, you must not stretch out your Hand with a repulsive Ges∣ture; nor, on the contrary, when you say, <HI>Stand back</HI>, must your Gesture be inviting; nor must you join your Hands, when you command Separation; nor open them, when your Order is <HI>closing</HI>; nor hang them down, when you bid <HI>raise such a Thing</HI>, or <HI>Person</HI>; nor lift them up, when you say <HI>throw them down</HI>. For all these Gestures would be so vi∣sibly against Nature, that you would be laugh'd at by all that saw or heard you. By these In∣stances of faulty Action, you may easily see the right, and gather this Rule, that as much as possible every Gesture you use should express the Nature of the Words you utter, which
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
would sufficiently and beautifully employ your Hands.</P>
<P>It is impossible to have any great Emotion or Gesture of the Body, without the Action of the Hands, to answer the Figures of Discourse, which are made use of in all Poetical, as well as Rhetorical Diction; for Poetry derives its Beauty in that from Rhetoric, as it does its Order and Justness from Grammar; which sur∣prizes me, that some of our modern taking Poets value themselves on that, which is not properly Poetry, but only made use of as an Ornament, and drawn from other Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>Thus when MEDEA says,
<Q><L>These Images of <HI>JASON</HI></L>
<L>With my own Hands I'll strangle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
'tis certain the Action ought to be express'd by the Hands, to give it all its Force.</P>
<P>In the lifting up the Hands, to preserve the Grace, you ought not to raise them above the Eyes; to stretch them farther might disorder and distort the Body; nor must they be very lit∣tle lower, because that Position gives a Beauty to the Figure: Besides, this Posture being ge∣nerally on some Surprize, Admiration, Abhor∣rence, &amp;c. which proceeds from the Object, that affects the Eye, Nature by a sort of Me∣chanic Motion throws the Hands out as Guards to the Eyes on such an Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107"/>You must never let either of your Hands hang down, as if lame or dead; for that is ve∣ry disagreeable to the Eye, and argues no Pas∣sion the in Imagination. In short, your Hands must always be in View of your Eyes, and so corresponding with the Motions of the Head, Eyes, and Body, that the Spectator may see their Concurrence, every one in its own Way to signify the same Thing, which will make a more agreeable, and by Consequence a deeper Impression on their Senses, and their Under∣standing.</P>
<P>Your Arms you should not stretch out side-ways, above half a Foot from the Trunk of your Body: You will otherwise throw your <HI>Gesture</HI> quite out of your Sight, unless you turn your Head also aside to pursue it, which would be very ridiculous.</P>
<P>In Swearing, Attestation, or taking any so∣lemn Vow or Oath, you must raise your Hand. An Exclamation requires the same Action: But so that the <HI>Gesture</HI> may not only answer the <HI>Pronunciation</HI>, or <HI>Utterance</HI>, but both the Na∣ture of the Thing, and the Meaning of the Words. In public Speeches, Orations, and Ser∣mons, it is true your Hands ought not to be always in Motion, a Vice which was once call'd the <HI>Babbling of the Hands</HI>; and, perhaps, it may reach some Characters, and Speeches in Plays; but I am of Opinion, that the Hands in Acting ought very seldom to be wholly quiescent, and that if we had the Art of the <HI>Pantomimes</HI>, of
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
expressing Things so clearly with their Hands, as to make the Gestures supply Words, the joining these significant Actions to the Words and Passions justly drawn by the Poet, would be no contemptible Grace in the Player, and render the Diversion infinitely more entertain∣ing, than it is at present. For indeed <HI>Action</HI> is the Business of the Stage, and an Error is more pardonable on the right, than the wrong Side.</P>
<P>There are some <HI>Actions</HI> or <HI>Gestures</HI>, which you must never make use of in Tragedy, any more than in Pleading, or Sermons, they be∣ing low, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter for Comedy or Burlesque En∣tertainments. Thus you must not put your∣self into the Posture of one <HI>bending a Bow, pre∣senting a Musquet</HI>, or playing on any Musical Instrument, as if you had it in your Hands.</P>
<P>You must never imitate any lewd, obscene or indecent Postures, let your Discourse be on the Debaucheries of the Age, or any Thing of that Nature, which the Description of an <HI>An∣thony</HI> and <HI>Verres</HI> might require our Discourse of.</P>
<P>When you speak in a <HI>Prosopopaeia</HI>, a Figure by which you introduce any Thing or Person speaking, you must be sure to use such Actions only, as are proper for the Character that you speak for. I can't remember at present one in Tragedy; but in Comedy <HI>Melantha</HI>, when she speaks for a Man, and answers him in her own Person, may give you some Image of
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
it. But these seldom happen in Plays, and in Orations not very frequently.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone through the Art of Action or Gesture, which tho' I have directed it chiefly for the Stage, and there principally for Trage∣dy, yet the <HI>Bar</HI>, and the <HI>Pulpit</HI> may learn some Lessons from what I have said, that would be of mighty use to make their Plead∣ing and Sermons of more Force and Grace: But, I think, the <HI>Pulpit</HI> chiefly has need of this Doctrine, because that converses more with the Passions, than the <HI>Bar</HI>, and treats of more sublime Subjects, meritorious of all the Beauty and Solemnity of Action. I am persuaded, that if our Clergy would apply them∣selves more to this Art, what they preach would be more efficacious, and themselves more respected; nay, have a greater Awe on their Auditors. But then it must be confess'd, it is next to impossible for them to attain this Per∣fection, while that Custom prevails of read∣ing of Sermons, which no Clergy in the World do but those of the Church of <HI>England</HI>. For while they read, they are not perfect enough in what they deliver, to give it its proper Ac∣tion and Emphasis, either in Pronunciation or Gesture. But the TATLER has handled this Particular very well; and if what he has said will have no Influence upon them, it will be much in vain for me to attempt it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comedians</HI>, I fear, may take it amiss, that I have had little or no Regard to them in
<PB N="106" REF="110"/>
these Rules. But, I must confess, tho' I have at∣tempted two or three Comical Parts, which the Indulgence of the Town to an old Fellow has given me some Applause for; yet Tragedy is, and has always been, my Delight. Besides, as some have observ'd, that Comedy is less diffi∣cult in the Writing; so I am apt to believe, it is much easier in the Acting; not that a good <HI>Comedian</HI> is to be made by every one that at∣temps it, but we have had, almost ever since I knew the Stage, more and better <HI>Comedians</HI>, than <HI>Tragedians</HI>; as we have better <HI>Comedies</HI> than <HI>Tragedies</HI> writ in our Language, as the Criticks and knowing Judges tell us. But be∣ing willing to raise Tragedies from their present Neglect, to the Esteem they had in the most polite Nation that ever <HI>Europe</HI> knew, I have endeavour'd to contribute my Part towards the improving of the Representation, which has a mighty Influence on the Success and Esteem of any Thing of this Nature.</P>
<P>We will now proceed to the other Duty of a Player, which is the Art of <HI>Speaking</HI>; which, tho' much the least considerable, yet, accord∣ing to our modern <HI>Tragedies</HI>, I mean those, which have been best receiv'd, is of most Use. For those Poets have very erroneously apply'd themselves to write more what re∣quires just <HI>Speaking</HI>, than just Acting: And our Players, generally speaking, fall very much short of that Excellence, ev'n in this which they ought to aim or arrive at; which but too plainly
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
proves what <HI>Roseneraus</HI> describes—<HI>An Airy of Children, little Yases, they cry out on the Top of the Question, and are most tyrannically clapt for't; these are now the Fashion, and so berattle the common Stages (so they call 'em) that many wearing Rapiers are afraid of Goose-Quills, and dare scarce come thither</HI>. And tho' what I have before quoted from <HI>Ham∣let</HI> (in this Account of the Actor's Action and Behaviour) does happily express the Soul and Art of Acting, which <HI>Shakespear</HI> has drawn, the compleat Art of Gesture in Miniature in the quoted Speech, yet all the Directions, which he gives, relate (except one Line) wholly to <HI>Speaking</HI>.</P>
<P>HAMLET.
<Q>“Speak the Speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it, trippingly on the Tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our Players do, I had as lieve the Town-Cryer had spoke my Lines. Nor do not saw the Air too much with your Hand thus, but use all gently: <HI>For in the very Torrent, Tempest, and I may say the Whirlwind of Pas∣sion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance, that may give it Smoothness.</HI> Oh! it of∣fends me to the Soul to see a robustous, <HI>per∣riwig-pated</HI> Fellow tear a Passion to Tat∣ters, to very Rags, to split the Ears of the Groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable <HI>dumb Shows</HI> and <HI>Noise</HI>. I could have such a Fel∣low whipt for o'erdoing Termagant: It out-<HI>Herod's
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>
Herod</HI>. Pray you avoid it—Be not too tame neither, but let your own Discretion be your Tutor. Suit the <HI>Ac∣tion</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI>, the <HI>Word</HI> to the <HI>Action</HI>, with this special Observance, that you o'er∣top not the Modesty of <HI>Nature</HI>. For any thing so overdone is from the Purpose of Playing, whose End, both at the first and now, was and is to hold as 'twere the Mir∣ror up to <HI>Nature</HI>; to shew Virtue her own Feature; scorn her own Image, and the very Age and Body of the Time, his Form and Pressure. Now this over-done, or come tardy off, tho' it make the Unskilful laugh, cannot but make the Judicious grieve: <HI>The Censure of which</HI> ONE, <HI>must in your Allow∣ance o'ersway a</HI> WHOLE THEATRE <HI>of others</HI>. Oh! there be Players, that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, (not to speak it prophanely) that neither hav∣ing the Accent of <HI>Christians</HI>, nor the Gait of <HI>Christian, Pagan</HI>, or <HI>Norman</HI>, have so <HI>strut∣ted</HI> and <HI>bellow'd, that I have thought some of Nature's Journey-Men had made Men, and not made them well, they imitated Humanity ”so abominably.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Player.</HI> "I hope we have reformed that in|"differently with us, Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Ham.</HI>
<Q>“Oh! reform it altogether. And let those, who play the Clowns, speak no more than is set down for 'em; for there be of them, who will themselves laugh, to set
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>
on some Quantity of barren Spectators to laugh too; tho' in the mean Time, some ne∣cessary Question of the Play be then to be consider'd: That's villainous, and shews a ”most <HI>pitiful Ambition</HI> in the Fool that uses it.</Q></P>
<P>If we should consider and weigh these Dire∣ctions well, I am persuaded they are suffi∣cient to instruct a young Player in all the Beau∣ties of <HI>Utterance</HI>, and to correct all the Errors he might, for want of the Art of Speaking, have incurr'd. By pronouncing it <HI>trippingly on the Tongue</HI>, he means a clear and disem∣barrass'd Pronunciation, such as is agreeable to Nature and the Subject on which he speaks. His telling the Actor, that he had as lieve the Town-Cryer should speak his Lines, as one that mouth'd them, is very just; for if Noise were an Excellence, I know not who would bear away the Palm, the <HI>Cryer</HI>, or the Player; I'm sure the Town-Cryer would be less faulty; his Business requiring Noise. <HI>Nor do not saw the Air with your Hand thus</HI>, but <HI>use all</HI> GEN∣TLY: This is the only Precept of Action, which is extremely just, and agreeable to the No∣tions of all, that I have met with on my full Enquiry among my learned Friends, who have read all that has been wrote upon Action, and who reckon <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>boisterous</HI> Gestures among the faulty: Art always directing a mo∣derate and gentle Motion, which <HI>Shakespear</HI> expresses by <HI>use all gently</HI>. Besides, this <HI>saw∣ing of the Air</HI>, expresses one who is very much at a Loss how to dipose of his Hands, but
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
knowing that they should have some Motion, gives them an aukward Violence. The next Observation is extremely masterly.—<HI>For in the very</HI> TORRENT, TEMPEST, <HI>and I may say the Whirlwind of Passion, you must acquire and get a Temperance, that may give it</HI> SMOOTHNESS. I remember, among many, an Instance in the Madness of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI>, in <HI>Lee</HI>'s Play. Mr. <HI>Goodman</HI> al∣ways went through it with all the Force the Part requir'd, and yet made not half the Noise as some who succeeded him; who were sure to bellow it out in such a man∣ner, that their Voice would fail them before the End, and lead them to such a languid and ennervate Hoarseness, as entirely wanted that agreeable <HI>Smoothness</HI>, which <HI>Shakespear</HI> requires, and which is the Perfection of beau∣tiful Speaking; for to have a just Heat, and Loudness, and yet a <HI>Smoothness</HI>, is all that can be desir'd. <HI>O! it offends me to the Soul</HI>, he goes on. —Methinks some of our young Gentlemen, who value themselves for great Players, nay, and Judges too of the <HI>Drama</HI>, set up for Critics, and who censure and re∣ceive or reject Plays, should be asham'd of themselves, when they read this in <HI>Shakespear</HI>, whose Authority they seem so fond on other Occasions.</P>

Some reported, that a Battalion of Soldiers begot her, and that her Mother died Drunk with Brandy in a Common-Sewer. They add, that she was at first no better than a Cinder-Wench; but that she sold Oranges, when first taken notice of, is generally agreed on; and then one Mr. <HI>Duncan</HI>, a Merchant, tak∣ing a Fancy to her smart Wit, fine Shape, and Foot, the least of any Woman's in <HI>England</HI>, kept her about two Years, then recommended her into the King's Play-house, where she be∣came an Actress in great Vogue, and Mistress both to old <HI>Lacy</HI> and young <HI>Hart</HI>, two fa∣mous Players at that Time.

Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>, paid their Addresses to her. She is mentioned to have come into the Royal Company of Comedians in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, a few Years after the first Opening of that House, in 1663. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See J. <HI>Downes</HI>'s <HI>Roscius Anglican.</HI> or Hist of the <HI>Stage</HI>. 8vo. 1708. p. 2.</NOTE> And the Parts she acted in some of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, Sir <HI>Robert Howard</HI>'s, and the Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI>'s, are also distinguished.

This Story may however perhaps-be excused: That having once by an unlucky Run of ill Luck at Gaming, lost all her Money, and run in Debt with Sir <HI>John Germain</HI>, he took the Advantage of making such a Propo∣sal for the easy Payment thereof, as may be well guessed at, by her Answer, when she replied, with equal Smartness and Fidelity to her Roy∣al Keeper, That truly, <HI>She was no such Sports∣woman, as to lay the Dog where the Deer should lie</HI>. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Charge against <HI>Mary</HI> his <HI>Dutchess</HI>; for Adultery with Sir <HI>J.

<P>Tho' the <HI>Revolters</HI> seemed to set up their iStandard here with great Satisfaction, and con∣stinued their Residence for about four Years, yet t was but in a Kind of fluctuating State; for everal of them were frequently deserting from one Company to another backwards and for∣wards from each of the subsisting Theatres.</P>
<P>To repair some very great Losses, which Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> had sustained, in the Years 1706, 1707, and 1708 successively, on <HI>Thursday</HI> the
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
7th of <HI>April</HI> 1709 the celebrated Comedy of <HI>Love for Love</HI>, was acted at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre for his Benefit. Those excellent Players Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Dogget</HI>, (then not concerned in the House) acted on this Oc∣casion. There had not been known so great a Concourse of Persons of Distinction, as at that Time: The Stage itself was covered with Gentlemen and Ladies, and when the Curtain was drawn up, it discovered even there a very splendid Audience. This unnusual Encou∣ragement, which was given to a Play, for the Advantage of so great an Actor, gave an undeniable Instance, that the true Relish for manly Entertainment and rational Pleasures was not then wholly lost. All the Parts were acted to Perfection; the Actors were care∣ful of their Carriage, and no one was guilty of the Affectation to insert Witticisms of his own, but a due Respect was had to the Au∣dience, for encouraging this admirable Player. It was not then doubted but <HI>Plays</HI> would re∣vive, and take their usual Place in the Opinion of Persons of Wit and Merit, and not degene∣rate into an Apostacy in Favour of <HI>Dress</HI> and <HI>Sound</HI>.</P>
<P>We must not omit to observe farther, that a <HI>Prologue</HI> written by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> was, on this Occasion, spoken by Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>; and an <HI>Epilogue</HI>, written by Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI>, was spoken by Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>. The <HI>for∣mer</HI> the Public were, not obliged with
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
but the latter was printed and dispersed in the House the very Night it was spoken. It was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>AS some brave Knight who once with Spear and Shield,</L>
<L>Had sought Renown in a many a well fought Field,</L>
<L>But now no more with sacred Fame inspir'd,</L>
<L>Was to a peaceful Hermitage retir'd;</L>
<L>There, if by Chance disast'rous Tales he hears,</L>
<L>Of Matrons Wrongs and Captive Virgins Tears,</L>
<L>He feels soft Pity urge his gen'rous Breast,</L>
<L>And vows once more to succour the Distrest:</L>
<L>Buckled in Mail he sallies on the Plain,</L>
<L>And turns him to the Feats of Arms again.</L>
<L>So we, to former Leagues of Friendship true,</L>

<L>To aid old <HI>Thomas</HI>, and to pleasure you.</L>
<L>Like Errant Damsels boldly we engage,</L>
<L>Arm'd, as you see, for the defenceless Stage.</L>
<L>Time was, when this good <HI>Man</HI> no Help did lack,</L>
<L>And scorn'd that any <HI>She</HI> should hold his Back.</L>
<L>But now, so Age and Frailty have ordain'd,</L>

<L>Had you with-held your Favours on this Night,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Ghost had ris'n to do him Right:</L>
<L>With Indignation had you seen him frown,</L>
<L>Upon a worthless, witless, tasteless Town;</L>
<L>Griev'd and repining you had heard him say,</L>
<L>Why are my famous Labous cast away?</L>
<L>Why did I only write, what only he could play?</L>

<L>Go on and make the gen'rous Work complete;</L>
<L>Be true to Merit, and still own his Cause,</L>
<L>Find something for him more than bare Applause.</L>
<L>In just Remembrance of your Pleasures past,</L>
<L>Be kind, and give him a Discharge at last.</L>
<L>In Peace and Ease Life's Remnant let him wear,</L>
<L>And hang his Consecrated Buskin here.</L></Q>
<P>In the Month of <HI>September</HI> following, <HI>Mr. Bet∣terton</HI> performed the Part of <HI>Hamlet</HI>; and in him every Spectator beheld the Force of Action in Perfection: He behaved himself so well, that though above Seventy, he acted Youth; and by the prevalent Power of proper Manner, Ges∣ture, and Voice, appeared through the whole <HI>Dra∣ma</HI> a young Man of great Expectation, Vivaci∣ty,
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
and Enterprize. The <HI>Soliloquy</HI> where he be∣gan the celebrated Sentence of —<HI>To be, or not to be</HI>; the <HI>Expostulation</HI> where he explains with his <HI>Mother</HI> in her Closet; the noble Ar∣dour, after seeing his <HI>Father's Ghost</HI>, and his generous Distress for the Death of <HI>Ophelia</HI>; are each of them Cirrcumstances which dwell strongly upon the Minds of the Audience, and would certainly affect their Behaviour on any parallel Occasions in their own Lives.</P>
<P>Such were the proper Ornaments, with which this great Man represented Virtue on the Stage.</P>
<P>But yet the indolent, emasculating <HI>Sing-Song</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI>, had gained so much Ground in <HI>England</HI>, that Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, weary of the Fatigues and Toil of Theatrical-Government, delivered his Company over to Mr. <HI>Vanbrugh</HI>'s new Licence. But they again giving way to the <HI>Operas</HI>, the Companies were once more united in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, and the <HI>Operas</HI>, con∣fined to the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>. However, Revolu∣tions became so frequent in this <HI>Dramatic State</HI>, that Mr. <HI>Swinny</HI> got the chief Players over to him and the Opera-House; among whom was Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, who being very much afflicted with the <HI>Gout</HI>, acted but seldom; yet at this Juncture, upon the Separation of the Houses, when Musical Performances were con∣fined to <HI>one</HI> Theatre, and Dramatic to the <HI>other</HI>, the <HI>British Enchanters</HI>; or, <HI>No Magick like Love</HI>, written by Lord <HI>Lansdowne</HI>, was brought on at the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Theatre</HI> in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>, 1710. Among the <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
of this truly polite <HI>English</HI> Opera, were (<HI>Men</HI>) Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, Mr. <HI>Verbruggen</HI>, &amp;c. (<HI>Women)</HI> Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Porter</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The sole Design of this excellent Perfor∣mance was a Portraiture of the Virtues of the immortal Queen <HI>Anne</HI>. The <HI>last Scene</HI> of it, re∣presented the <HI>Queen</HI> (and all the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of her Majesty's Reign)
<Q><L>Surveying round her, with impartial Eyes,</L>
<L>Whom to protect, or whom she should chastise.</L>
<L>In ev'ry Line of her auspicious Face,</L>
<L>Soft Mercy smil'd, adorn'd with ev'ry Grace.</L>
<L>Sure Hope of all who dire Oppression bear,</L>
<L>For all th'Oppress'd become her instant Care.</L>
<L>Nations, of Conquest proud, she tam'd to free,</L>
<L>Denouncing War, presenting Liberty;</L>
<L>The Victor to the Vanquish'd yields a Prize,</L>
<L>For in her Triumph, their Redemption lies.</L>
<L>Freedom and Peace for ravish'd Fame she gave;</L>
<L>Invades to bless, and conquers but to save.</L>
<L>So the Sun scorches, and revives by turns,</L>
<L>Requiting with rich Metals, where he burns.</L>
<L>Taught by this great Example to be just,</L>
<L>Succeeding Kings shall well fulfil their Trust;</L>
<L>Discord and War, and Tyranny shall cease,</L>
<L>And jarring Nations be compell'd to Peace;</L>
<L>Princes and States, like Subjects, shall agree,</L>
<L>To trust her Power, safe in her Piety.</L>
<L><HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Glory was this Royal Dame,</L>
<L>From <HI>Stuart</HI>'s Race she rose, and <HI>Anna</HI> was her <HI>Name</HI>.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="128"/>The chief Performers in this Opera, from their Deserts justly gained an universal Applause; but the same Year of its Representation, de∣prived the World of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, who died shortly after. His true Character follows, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See, <HI>the Tatler.</HI> No. 167.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>“SUCH an Actor as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ought to be Recorded with the same Re∣spect a <HI>Roscius</HI> among the <HI>Romans</HI>. The greatest Orator has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <HI>Roscius</HI> was the Example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning Beha∣viour. His Action was so well adapted to the Sentiments he expressed, that the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> thought they wanted only to be vir∣tuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <HI>Roscius</HI>. The Imagination took a lovely Im∣pression of what was great and good; and they who never thought of setting up for the Art of Imitation, became themselves ini∣”mitable Characters.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“There is no human Invention so aptly calculated for the forming a free-born People as that of a Theatre. <HI>Tully</HI> reports, That the celebrated Player of whom I am speak∣ing, used frequently to say, <HI>The Perfection of an Actor is only to become what he is doing</HI>. Young Men, who are too unattentive to re∣ceive Lectures, are irresistibly taken with Per∣formances.
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
Hence it is, that I extremly la∣ment the little Relish the Gentry of this Na∣tion have at present for the just and noble Representations in some of our Tragedies. The Operas, which are of late introduced, can leave no Trace behind them that can be of Service beyond the present Moment. To sing and to dance are Accomplishments ve∣ry few have any Thoughts of practising; but to speak justly and move gracefully, is what every Man thinks he does perform, or wishes ”he did.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have hardly a Notion, that any Perform∣er of Antiquity could surpass the Action of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> in any of the Occasions in which he has appeared on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he appeared in, when he examined the Circumstance of the Handkerchief in <HI>Othello</HI>; the Mixture of Love that intruded upon his Mind upon the innocent Answers <HI>Desdemona</HI> makes, betrayed in his Gesture such a Variety and Vicissitude of Passions, as would admonish a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, that it is to stab it, to admit that worst of Daggers, Jealousy. Whoever reads in his Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this admirable Scene, will find that he cannot, except he has as warm an Imagination as <HI>Shakespear</HI> himself, find any but dry, incoherent and broken Sentences: But a Reader that has seen <HI>Betterton</HI> act it,
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>
observes there could not be a Word added; that longer Speeches had been unnatural, nay impossible, in <HI>Othello</HI>'s Circumstances. The charming Passage in the same Tragedy, where he tells the Manner of winning the Affection of his Mistress, was urged with so moving and graceful an Energy, that while I walked in the Cloysters, I thought of him with the same Concern as if I waited for the Remains of a Person who had in real Life done all that I had seen him represent. The Gloom of the Place, and faint Lights before the Ce∣remony appeared, contributed to the melan∣choly Disposition I was in; and I began to be extreemly afflicted, that <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cas∣sius</HI> had any Difference; that <HI>Hotspur</HI>'s Gal∣lantry was so unfortuante; and that the Mirth and good Humour of <HI>Falstaff</HI> could not ex∣empt him from the Grave. Nay, this Oc∣casion in me, who look upon the Distinctions amongst Men to be meerly scenical, raised Reflections upon the Emptiness of all hu∣man Perfection and Greatness in general; and I could but regret, that the sacred Heads which lie buried in the Neighbourhood of this little Portion of Earth in which my poor old Friend is deposited, are returned to Dust as well he, and that there is no Differ∣ence in the Grave between the imaginary and the real Monarch. This made me say of ”human Life it self with <HI>Mackbeth</HI>:

<L>To-morrow, To-morrow, and To-morrow,</L>
<L>Creeps in a stealing Pace from Day to Day,</L>

<L>And all your Yesterdays have lighted Fools</L>
<L>To the eternal Night! Out, out short Handle!</L>
<L>Life's but a walking Shadow, a poor Player</L>
<L>That struts and frets his Hour upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And then is heard no more.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was interred in the Cloyster of <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI>.</P>
<P>We are now to return to Mrs. <HI>Barry</HI>, who did not long survive him; for she found such an inward Decay, that she was obliged to quit the Stage above seven Years before she died, which was on the 7th Day of <HI>November</HI>, 1713. She was interred at <HI>Acton</HI>, in the County of <HI>Middlesex</HI>. She had a Daughter by the celebrated <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>, who by Will 1680, left her an Annuity of 40 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> She died at about 13 Years of Age, and lies interred at the same Place.

<P>MR. <HI>Wilks</HI> was descended from a very good Family in <HI>Warwickshire</HI>; in which County all his Predecessors were born. His Fa∣ther, <HI>Edward Wilks</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was obliged to leave <HI>England</HI> through Misfortunes, and some Friends he had in <HI>Ireland</HI> procured him the Post of be∣ing one of the Pursuivants to the Lord Lieute∣nant of that Kingdom. He had three Sons, <HI>Ed∣ward, Robert</HI>, and <HI>William</HI>. The <HI>Second</HI> of which, our late excellent Comedian, was born at a little Village called <HI>Rathfarnam</HI>, near <HI>Dublin</HI>, 1665. He was bred up under Mr Secretary <HI>Southwell</HI>, and had for some Years a Seat in his Office; being an excellent Clerk, and wrote a

fine Hand. Upon the Breaking-out of King <HI>James</HI>'s Wars in <HI>Ireland</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> was for∣ced into the Army by Capt. <HI>Bourk</HI>, and was exempted from Military Duty, being made Clerk to the Camp. But the natural Propensi∣ty of his Genius was wholly turned towards the <HI>Stage</HI>, and hearing so much of the just Praises of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>'s Merit, he was not easy till he came over, and privately by a Stratagem escap∣ed from his Military Clerkship.</P>
<P>At his Arrival in <HI>England</HI>, he was indeed en∣tertained by Mr. <HI>Christopher Rich</HI>; but on no higher Terms than fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, out of which he was to allow ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month for learning to dance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> was the Master of whom he learnt; and at whose School, after Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> had been above a Year in <HI>England</HI>, he saw a young Gentlewoman of about 20 Years of Age, with whom he fell in Love. This was Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Knapton</HI>, youngest Daughter of <HI>Fer∣dinando Knapton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Town-Clerk of <HI>South∣ampton</HI>, and Steward of the <HI>New Forest</HI>. In due Time she brought Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> a Son, who was christened <HI>Robert</HI>. The Child was put to Nurse, and committed to the Guardianship of Mr: <HI>Bowen</HI> the Player, upon Mr: <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Return to <HI>Ireland</HI>, who took his Wife with him, upon the following Occasion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI>, Master of the <HI>Dublin</HI> Theatre, coming over to recruit his <HI>Stage</HI>, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> thinking Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> did not give Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> suffici∣ent Encouragement, especially since he had now
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
an increasing Family to provide for, earnestly recommended Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> to Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI>, as a young Man of very growing Hopes, and deserv∣ing of Favours. From this Character given of him, Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI> contracted with Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> for 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year certain, and a Benefit-Play. Upon these Terms was Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> deprived of Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>. But it was not long before he was made sensible of his Loss, and forced to send a special Messenger to <HI>Ireland</HI> to regain him: The Person deputed to go was Mr. <HI>Swinney</HI>, who with great Privacy got Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> and his Wife back, after contracting to allow him 4 <HI>l. per</HI> Week; the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> having is∣sued a Warrant that Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> should not de∣part the Kingdom, so much was he beloved in <HI>Ireland</HI>. However, Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> was rightly serv∣ed; and Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> but justly rewarded.</P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s dear Friend Mr. <HI>Far∣quhar</HI> left the <HI>Irish Stage</HI>, and came over with him, which was owing to a melancholy Accident.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was also extremely beloved in <HI>Ireland</HI>, and had indeed the Advantage of a ve∣ry good Person; though his Voice was weak; but as he never met with the least Repulse from the Audience in any of his Performances, he was resolved to continue on the <HI>Stage</HI>, till some∣thing better should offer; but this Resolution was soon broke by an Accident, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> being to play the Part of <HI>Guyomar</HI>, (in the <HI>Indian Emperor</HI>) who kills
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
<HI>Vasquez</HI> (one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Generals,) and for getting to exchange his Sword for a Foyl in the Engagement, he wounded his Brother Tra∣gedian, who acted <HI>Vasquez</HI>, very dangerously; and tho' it proved not mortal, yet it so shocked the natural Tenderness of Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Tem∣per, that it put a Period to his Acting ever after. But in a short Time the Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI>, in Re∣gard to his particular Merit, gave him a Lieu∣tenancy in his Regiment then in <HI>Ireland</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, well knowing the Abilities of Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, after their Arrival in <HI>England</HI>, he never ceased his Importunities with him, till he had prevailed on him to write a Play; assur∣ing him that he would gain much more Re∣putation by <HI>writing for the Stage</HI>, than <HI>appear∣ing on it</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI>, in the <HI>Island Princess</HI>, was the first Part Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> played at his Return to <HI>England</HI>; upon which Occasion he thus address∣ed the Audience.</P>

<P>In the Year 1698, Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, having ta∣ken Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Advice, had a Comedy brought upon the <HI>Stage</HI>, called <HI>Love and a Bottle</HI>. To which there was a very humorous <HI>Prologue</HI> and <HI>Epilogue</HI>, both written by <HI>Jo. Haynes</HI>, the lat∣ter spoken by him in Mourning. Mr: <HI>Wilks</HI> had not any Part in this Play; but Mrs. <HI>Rogers</HI> (of whom more hereafter) acted <HI>Lucinda</HI>, a Lady of considerable Fortune, and Mr. <HI>Mills Lovewell</HI>, her Gallant.</P>
<P>About this Time the <HI>English</HI> Theatre was not only pestered with Tumblers, and Rope-Dancers from <HI>France</HI>, but likewise Dancing-Masters, and Dancing-Dogs; Shoals of <HI>Italian</HI> Squallers were daily imported and the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Company almost broke. Upon this Oc∣casion

<P>BARTON BOOTH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was very well descended, and nearly related to the Earls of <HI>Warrington</HI>; nay, he has assured me that his Family always looked upon themselves as the Eldest Branch of the House of <HI>Booth</HI>. This excellent Tragedian, was the Son of <HI>John Booth</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> born 1681.</P>
<P><HI>Lancashire</HI> was the County of his Nativity, from whence his Father, with his whole Fami∣ly, removed to Town, and settled at <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI>, 1684. Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> (the youngest of Three Sons) was at nine Years of Age put under the Tuition of the <HI>Celebrated Dr. Busby</HI> under whom he became an excellent Scholar. He shewed, while at School, his great Inclination
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
to Poetry; and was very fond of repeating Po∣etical Performances and Parts of Plays, in all which he discovered a very promising Genius for the Stage. But Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s first Encourage∣ment in <HI>Acting</HI> came from his Master at the <HI>Rehearsal</HI> of a <HI>Latin Play</HI> in which he performed with general Applause.</P>
<P>The following Part of a <HI>Prologue</HI> was spoken at <HI>Westminster-School</HI>, which will evidently dis∣cover their high Esteem for Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>, as an Actor <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Your Antique Actors, as we read,</L>
<L>No more than Anticks were indeed:</L>
<L>With wide-mouth'd Masks their Babes to fright,</L>
<L>They kept the Countenance from Sight.</L>
<L>Now Faces on the Stage are shown;</L>
<L>Nor speak they with their Tongues alone,</L>
<L>But in each Look a Force there lies,</L>
<L>That speaks the Passion to the Eyes.</L>
<L>See then, which best deserves our Praise,</L>
<L>The Vizard, or the Human Face?</L>
<L>Old <HI>Roscius</HI> to <HI>our Booth</HI> must bow;</L>
<L>'Twas then but Art, 'tis Nature Now.</L></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> was at that time designed by his Father for Orders; but as he had received such early Praises of his blooming Qualifications for an <HI>Actor</HI>, and that from Persons of such Importance, it was not to be wondered at, that his Inclination led him to the Stage; in pur∣suance of which, and to avoid being sent to the
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
University, he ran away from School at 17 Years old, and went to <HI>Ireland</HI>, where he en∣tered himself with Mr. <HI>Ashbury</HI>, Master of the Theatre at <HI>Dublin</HI>.</P>
<P>He remained there Two Years, and acquired the Reputation of a very good Player. He re∣turned to <HI>England</HI> in 1701, and applied himself to Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI>, a Lord of the Bedcham∣ber to Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI>. His Lord∣ship recommended him to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> as a very promising Genius, who took him under his Care, and made him what he was. The Part of <HI>Maximus</HI> in <HI>Valentinian</HI> was chosen for his first Appearance. Mr. <HI>Verbruggen</HI> play'd <HI>Valentinian</HI>, Mr. <HI>Betterton Etius</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Barry Lucina</HI>. There never was more Applause expressed by any Audience, then was given to Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> on that Occasion.</P>
<P>Soon after he again appeared with univer∣sal Applause, in the Character of ARTABAN in the <HI>Ambitious Step-Mother</HI>.</P>
<P>In the Year 1704, he married Mrs. <HI>Fran∣ces Barkham</HI>, Second Daughter to Sir <HI>William Barkham</HI>, Bart. of <HI>Norfolk</HI>, who died in 1710. without Issue.</P>
<P>CATO greatly augmented both Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s Fame and Interest, by procuring him the Fa∣vour of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>, then Secretary of State; who, within a Year after, as a Reward for so much singular Merit, got him added to the Number of the Managers, by procuring him a special License from Queen ANNE.</P>

<HEAD>A Character of Mr. <HI>BOOTH,</HI> by <HI>Aaron Hill,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>TWO Advantages distinguished him, in the strongest Light, from the rest of his Fraternity: He had Learning to understand per∣fectly whatever it was his Part to speak; and Judgment to know how far it agreed or disa∣greed with his Character. Hence arose a pe∣culiar Grace, which was visible to every Spec∣tator; tho' few were at the Pains of examin∣ing into the Cause of their Pleasure. He could soften and slide over, with a kind of elegant Negligence, the Improprieties in a Part he act∣ed, while, on the contrary, he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties; as if he ex∣erted a latent Spirit, which had been kept back for such an Occasion, that he might alarm, a∣waken, and transport, in those Places only, where the Dignity of his own good Sense could be supported by that of his Author.</P>
<P>A little Reflection upon this remarkable Quality, will teach us to account for that mani∣fest
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>
Languor which has sometimes been ob∣serv'd in his Action, and which was generally, tho' I think falsly, imputed to the natural In∣dolence of his Temper.</P>
<P>For the same Reason, tho' in the customary Rounds of his Business he would condescend to some Parts in Comedy, he seldom appear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character. The Passions which he found in Comedy were not strong enough to excite his Fire; and what seem'd Want of Qualification, was only Absence of Impression.</P>
<P>He had a Talent at discovering the Passions, where they lay hid in some celebrated Parts, by the injudicious Practice of other Actors. When he had discover'd, he soon grew able to express them: And his Secret for attaining this great Lesson of the Theatre, was an Adaption of his Look to his Voice; by which artful Imita∣tion of Nature, the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance. So that it was Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s peculiar Felicity to be Heard and Seen the same, whether as the <HI>Pleas'd</HI>, the <HI>Griev'd</HI>, the <HI>Pitying</HI>, the <HI>Reproachful</HI>, or the <HI>Angry</HI>.</P>
<P>One would almost be tempted to borrow the Aid of a very bold Figure, and, to express this Excellence the more significantly, beg Permis∣sion to affirm, that the Blind might have seen him in his Voice, and the Deaf have heard him in his Visage.</P>
<P>His Gesture, or, as it is commonly call'd, his Action was but the Result and necessary Con∣sequence
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>
of this Dominion over his Voice and Countenance: For having, by a Concurrence of two such Causes, impressed his Imagination with such a Stamp and Spirit of Passion, his Nerves obeyed the Impulse by a kind of Natural De∣pendency, and relaxed or braced successively in∣to all that fine Expressiveness, with which he painted what he spoke, without Restraint or Affectation.</P>

<P>Our excellent Tragedian, being carried by his Father into <HI>Ireland</HI> in the Year 1700, then but Eight Years old, was educated under that eminent School-Master, the Reverend Dr. <HI>Jones</HI> of <HI>Dublin</HI>.</P>

<P>From this Disappointment at Law, he was advised by his Friends, to cultivate a Natural Propensity, and apply himself to the Stage, which he did with some Success in that King∣dom. But the <HI>Irish Theatre</HI> then labouring under great Discouragement, he returned to

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>WILLIAM MILWARD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is a Native of the City of <HI>Litchfield</HI>, where he was born on the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1702. His Father was an eminent Attorney at Law, at that Time resi∣ding there. The <HI>Milwards</HI> are descended from an ancient Family in the County of <HI>Derby</HI>, well known for their Loyalty and steady Attachment to their Prince; as a Proof of which, in the Troubles of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Great Grand∣father of our Player, Sir <HI>Thomas Milward</HI> Knight, Chief Justice of <HI>Chester</HI>, at his own Expence raised and maintained a Troop of Horse in Defence of his King and Country: Among whom were likewise his Grandfather, and several other Relations of Mr. <HI>Milward</HI>, to who I will now return. His Father (when he was very young,) removing from <HI>Litchfield</HI> to <HI>Ut∣toxeter</HI>, a Market Town in the same County, he had his Education in the Grammar School there; which School is always supplied with Masters from <HI>Trinity-College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI>, and an yearly Stipend from the said College allowed for their Support. Before the Age of Sixteen, he came with his Father to <HI>London</HI>, and was put Apprentice to an Apothecary in <HI>Norfolk-Street</HI>, in the <HI>Strand</HI>, 1717, with whom he con∣tinued near eight Years; but being accquainted with some young Gentlemen, sometimes acted Plays privately for the Diversion of themselves and Friends, he was prevailed on to join them,
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
and accordingly performed several Parts among them, in a small private Theatre made at the <HI>Hoop</HI> Tavern in <HI>St. Alban's-Street</HI>. Being flat∣tered by some Friends that he would make a con∣siderable Figure on a publick Stage, to which his Genius strongly led him, he resolv'd to quit the Study of Physick for that of the Drama, and accordingly, in the Year 1724 commenced at the New Theatre in the <HI>Hay-market</HI>, with a young Company who had never appear'd on a publick Stage; whose Incapacity and Inexpe∣rience soon gave way to Two established Thea∣tres, and obliged them to provide other ways for themselves, according to their different Ca∣pacities. Some quitted the Thoughts of the Stage; others, by Flattery and their own Inclinations, resolved to pursue that way of Life; among whom Mr. <HI>Milward</HI> was one, and in the Year 1725, engaged in Mr. <HI>Rich</HI>'s Company at the Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, where he con∣tinued till the Opening of the Theatre in <HI>Co∣vent-Garden</HI>, and all that Season; at the End of which he had Overtures from the Company of Comedians who had just separated themselves from the Managers of the Theatre Royal in <HI>Dru∣ry-Lane</HI>, with whom (after he had received a Message from Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> that the Salary he ex∣pected would not be complied with, and giv∣ing him proper Notice) he again agreed to per∣form at the New Theatre in the <HI>Hay-market</HI>, where he continued till the Company agreed with Mr. <HI>Fleetwood</HI> to return again to <HI>Dru∣ry-Lane</HI>, under whose Direction they now are.
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>
The Parts Mr. <HI>Milward</HI> is possessed of being too numerous to be recited, the Town are the best Judges of his Daily Improvement; and he may be justly thought to be the most pro∣per Successor of Mr. <HI>Quin</HI>, who has now left this Stage and Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>HENRY GIFFARD</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is the youngest of Eight Sons of <HI>William Giffard</HI>, of the County of <HI>Bucks</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> he was born in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> in the Year 1699, and educated at a Private Gram∣mar-School in <HI>London</HI>. At about Sixteen Years of Age, thro' the Interest of his Father, he was appointed one of the Clerks of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, in which Post he continued near Three Years; but having a stronger Propen∣sity to the Martial Acts of the Stage than the Mercantile Accompts of the State, he made an Excursion, and entered himself among the <HI>Bath</HI> Strolling Company of Comedians, 1719, whose Fortunes he followed two Years, whol∣ly unknown to all his Friends. Returning to Town, and hoping to atone for this Excursion with his Father, who was then in <HI>London</HI> in a very declining State of Health, he was disap∣pointed in these Hopes by his Father's Death, which happened in about six Months after. Being thus left wholly destitute and deprived of his Fortune as a severe Punishment for his Fault, he was obliged to make the best of that Inclina∣tion which prompted him to the Commission
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
of it. He was taken into Mr. <HI>Rich</HI>'s Company. Here he staid about two Years, and then went to <HI>Ireland</HI>. In the <HI>Dublin Theatre</HI> he was very readily accepted, and in a very short time was admitted one of the Sharers. Soon after he Mar∣ried a young Gentlewoman of that Theatre, who died before she was Twenty Years of Age, in Childbed of a Daughter; but, as some Com∣pensation for so great a Loss, she left him a Son now about her Age. She had a very promising Genius to have shone in her Profession; was very amiable in her Person, and in her Affection as a Wife every way deserving Praise.</P>
<P>About six Years afterwards he married ano∣ther Gentlewoman of the same Theatre; by whom he has had Issue one Daughter, who di∣ed an Infant of but two Years old.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and his Wife came to <HI>England</HI> 1730. Here it must be observed, that he had some Hopes of Success, from an Invitation made him, with great Shew of Friendship, by Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>. But Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> not brooking too long a De∣lay, and the Project of the <HI>Goodman's-Fields</HI> Theatre just then opening, he closed in with that Undertaker; who not succeeding therein, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> from a different Conduct became the sole Proprietor, and in 1733 rebuilt it in a ve∣ry commodious Manner, giving Universal Sa∣tisfaction to the Town, as he does at present, by his Regularity and prudent Behaviour.</P>

Having had a tolerable Education, he was put Apprentice to Mr. <HI>Curll, Bookseller</HI>, in the Year 1718. After he had served about two Years, he took it into his Head, that there was more to be got by acting of Plays, than by selling of them. His Master very generously advised his Father to let him prosecute the Bent of his Genius, and very amicably surrendered him up to the Stage. He trod the Theatres of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI> and <HI>Dublin</HI>; but found the most hospitable Enter∣tainment with his valuable Friend Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>.</P>
<P>He was taken off in the Vigour of his Age, in a most sudden and surprizing manner. Be∣ing very fond of shewing the Strength and Soundness of his Lungs, as he imagined, by loud Hemming, one Day, as he was in the <HI>Green-Room</HI> at <HI>Goodman's-Fields</HI>, to shew the <HI>Clear∣ness of his Pipes</HI>, as he expressed himself, he fetched a very <HI>hearty Hem</HI>, with such Violence, that he broke some considerable <HI>Blood-Vessel</HI>; for in a short time he found himself Giddy, Sick, and turned Pale: He went behind the Scene and a large Quantity of Blood issuing from his Mouth, almost unknown to him, he was advised to
<PB N="159" REF="163"/>
go home. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> sent for Dr. <HI>Beaufort</HI>, and another Eminent Physician; but the Flux of Blood continuing in so large a Quantity from his Mouth, as was computed in the whole to be near two Gallons, they thought it in vain to prescribe, and he died the 24th Hour after his Hemming. An Accident of this kind, was looked on as unheard of before.</P>
<P>Both Nature and Inclination had formed him for a very excellent Player, had he lived; and what he was at the Time of his Death, will be seen from the following just Character given of him by Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, who buried him in a ve∣ry genteel Manner, at his own Expence, at <HI>St. Mary White-Chapel</HI>, in the 35th Year of his Age. He has left a Son about Eight Years old.</P>
<P>"Mr. <HI>Charles Hulett</HI> was endowed with great Abilities for a Player; but laboured under the Disadvantage of a Person rather too Corpulent for the <HI>Hero</HI> or the <HI>Lover</HI>, but his Port well be∣came <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, <HI>Falstaff, Othello</HI>, and many other Characters both in Tragedy and Comedy, in which he would have been equally excellent, had his Application and Figure been proporon∣able to his Qualifications; which had he du∣ly cultivated, he would undoubtedly have be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome a very considerable Performer."</P>

can remind us of the excellent <HI>Original</HI>; so much is the Business of Acting reduced from its former Glory. I shall only add one Obser∣vation more, which is, that in the Meridian of Life she retains her <HI>Beauty</HI>, even without the entire Loss of her <HI>Bloom</HI>, and is, by far, the best Figure on either Stage.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. CATHARINE RAFTOR.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentlewoman was born in <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1711. She is the Daughter of <HI>William Raftor</HI>, Son of <HI>James Raftor</HI>, Es{que} of the City of <HI>Kilkenny</HI>, in the Kingdom of <HI>Ire∣land</HI>; a Gentleman of a very Ancient Roman Catholick Family, and possessed of a consider∣able Estate, which, at the late Revolution, was forfeited to the Crown, by his Sons being all en∣gaged in the Service of King <HI>James</HI>. After the Battle of the <HI>Boyne</HI>, her Father attended his Majesty to <HI>France</HI>, and obtained a Cap∣tain's Commission in the <HI>French</HI> King's Service: But growing weary of a Military Life, came to <HI>London</HI>, obtained a Pardon of King <HI>William</HI>, and afterwards married Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Daniel</HI>, Daughter of <HI>Edward Daniel</HI>, an eminent Lea∣ther-seller on <HI>Fish-Street-Hill</HI>, with whom he had a handsome Fortune. He was bred to the Law; but, being of the <HI>Romish</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
Persuasion, practised under such Restrictions as prevented his doing any Thing more for his Fa∣mily (which was very large) than bestowing a genteel Education on them.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Raftor</HI> came on the Stage in the Year 1728, and married Mr. <HI>George Clive</HI>, an Attorney at Law, in 1732.</P>
<P>This excellent Actress, was first distinguished in the Character of <HI>Dorinda</HI>, in the <HI>Tempest</HI>. But so extensive has been her Genius in the <HI>Drama</HI>, that it may be said, without the least Tincture of Flattery, no Woman, at her Age, ever shone, in so great a Variety of Cha∣racters, the Truth of which Assertion, <HI>the numerous List of her Parts, would, if recited, demonstrate</HI>.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall close these our Dramatic Me∣moirs with the Sentiments of Mr. Se∣cretary <HI>Addison</HI>, in relation to Theatrical-En∣tertainments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"I cannot, says he, be of the same Opinion with the <HI>Reformers of Manners</HI>, in their Severity towards PLAYS; but must allow, that a good Play, acted before a well-bred Audience, must raise very proper Incitements to good Beha∣viour, and be the most quick and most pre∣vailing Method of giving young People a Turn of Sense and Breeding.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171"/>"When the Character, drawn by a judicious Poet, is presented by the Person, the Manner, the Look and the Motion of an accomplished Player, what may not be brought to pass by seeing generous Things performed before our Eyes? <HI>The Stage is the best Mirrour of human Life</HI>; let me therefore recommend the apt Use of a Theatre as the most agree∣able and easy Method of making a polite and moral Gentry, which would end in rendering the rest of the People regular in their Beha∣viour, and ambitious of laudable Undertakings."</P>
