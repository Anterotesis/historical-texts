<P>THE Author begs Leave to premise, that in this Essay, he has retained some few of the obsolete Words of <HI>Spenser,</HI> and adopted the Sim∣plicity of the Diction in the ludicrous Cast, at the End of most of the Stanzas, to give it more the Air of that great Original.—He thinks he need not make any Apology for the Stile and Measure of the Verse, they being generally, if not univer∣sally allowed, the most suitable for Works of this Kind. — In order to make it more intelligible, at the Foot of each Page, is given an Explanation of the obsolete Words, as they occur. — As to the
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
modern Terms of the Ladies Dress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which per∣haps may be thought by some, to require as much Explanation as the obsolete Ones) he presumes as they are pretty well known among the Ladies and Beau Monde, he may be excused a Discussion.— Upon the whole, he hopes, that the novel Manner of thus treating these Subjects, will in some Measure atone for its many Imperfections.</P>
