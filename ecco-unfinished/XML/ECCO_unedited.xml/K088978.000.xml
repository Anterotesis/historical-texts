<P>THE original plan of this work proposed no more than. that each volume should contain a narrative of those events which distinguish its own Year. But, because we have entered upon our undertaking in the heat of an almost general and very important war, I thought it would not be unnecessary or disagreeable to look a little farther back. It would be difficult, perfectly to understand the operations of the several powers at war, during the last year, without reviewing the transactions of the pre∣ceding years; nor would it be easy to enter into the spirit of these with∣out examining the causes which
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
more nearly or remotely operated to produce those troubles that have in∣volved so many parts of the world in one common distraction.</P>
<P>The war in which all parties and interests seem now to be so perfectly blended, arose from causes which originally had not the least connec∣tion: the uncertain limits of the English and French territories in America; and the mutual claims of the houses of Austria and Brande∣bourg on the dutchy of Silesia. It is no wonder that the two former powers seizing on a country in which they considered the right of the na∣tural inhabitants as nothing, should find it a very difficult matter to settle their own. For a long time neither of these powers were sufficiently ac∣quainted with the geography of A∣merica, to enable them to ascertain the limits of their several pretensions with any tolerable exactness; nor, indeed, were these matters deemed of sufficient moment to call for a very laborious discussion. At the treaty of Utrecht, whilst so many more important interests, or what then seemed more important, were discussed, the limits of Nova Scotia, then called Acadia, were expressed only in general terms, and left to be put on a more certain footing by subsequent negotiations. These ne∣gotiations pursued with no vigour, and drawn out into an excessive length, seemed only to increase the former confusion. After the acces∣sion of the present Royal Family, a French: connection, perhaps neces∣sary from the circumstances of the time, and afterwards a certain ne∣gligence of all affairs but those of our domestic polity, suffered this important point to vanish almost wholly out of our consideration. During this interval, our colonies on the continent of North America, extended themselves on every side. Whilst agriculture and the maritime commerce flourished on their coasts, the Indian trade drew several of our wandering dealers far into the inland country, and beyond the great mountains. Here they found them∣selves in a delightful climate, in a soil abundantly fruitful, and watered with many fair and navigable rivers. These advantages, joined to those of the Indian trade, appeared to com∣pensate for its remoteness from the sea. It was judged, that as the first settlers on the coast, we had a good right to the inland country; and, if so, to the navigation of the Missisippi, which opened another door to the ocean. With these views, a com∣pany of merchants and planters, ob∣tained a charter for a considerable tract of land near the River Ohio, on the western side of the Allegeney mountains, but within the province of Virginia; and the adventurers began to settle pursuant to the terms of their patent.</P>
<P>Now began to shoot forth the seeds of another dispute, which had long lain unobserved, but which proved altogether as thorney and in∣tricate as that concerning the limits of Acadia. The French pretending to have first discovered the mouths of the Missisippi, claimed the whole ad∣jacent country, towards New Mexico on the east, quite to the Apalachian or Allegeney mountains on the west. They drove off the new settlers, and built a strong fort called du Quesne, on the forks of the River Mononga∣hela; a situation which commanded the entrance into all the country on the Ohio and Missisippi.</P>
<P>The reader will observe, that I do not pretend to decide con∣cerning the right of either nation in this contest. It is evident e∣nough, that the consideration of
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
the right had much less influence on both parties, than the consideration of conveniency. Should the French be able to unite Canada to their co∣lonies at the mouth of Missisippi by a possession of all that vast country which lies between them, the En∣glish colonies must lose all share in the Indian trade in time of peace; and in time of war be exposed to continual dangers, or to the ruin∣ously chargeable defence of a fron∣tier more than 1500 miles in length. If on the contrary, the French should fail to make good these claims on the Ohio, and those on Nova Scotia, their two colonies entirely disunited, and the entrance into one shut up for the winter season by frost, and the entrance into the other difficult in all seasons by the banks at the mouth of the Missisippi, must certainly lose all their value to France, and in their fall involve much of the for∣tune of their great settlements in the West Indies.</P>
<P>Both nations being fully persuaded of this, no longer looked on the affair of the Ohio as a matter of indiffe∣rence. They prepared to cut the gordian knot of the long and intri∣cate negotiation by the sword. Ships were fitted out, and some troops silently sent off from Brest. General Braddock sailed to Virginia with a∣bout 1500 regular troops; 24 men of war under the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1755.</NOTE> Admirals Boscawen and Mostyn were ordered to America, to inter∣cept the French supplies. Orders were sent to our colonies to arm; and three operations were actually undertaken, one against Fort du Quesne under Braddock; the other two against the French forts in No∣va Scotia, and the fort of Crown Point on the frontiers of New York. The two courts in the mean time breathed nothing but peace, and ex∣changed reciprocal professions of friendship and good will, which de∣ceived neither party.</P>
<P>They who are of opinion that the passions and characters of the ruling men, influence all public concerns as much as the public interests themselves, thought they saw other causes operating to hasten this breach. On the death of a great Minister, which happened some time before, the administration was new mould∣ed. Some persons then taken in, were considered as belonging to a party not perfectly united with the remains of the old administration. It was thought, that the leading man of this party proposed to work out the old servants of the crown, in order to make way for a more uni∣form system. As long as peace subsists, government is supported by itself; and any change is difficult. But the conduct of a war, is a thing critical to a ministry. The leader of this party, therefore, conscious of his own talents, which all men ac∣knowledged to be conspicuous, and of his connexions which were consi∣derable, warmly pushed on a war, seconded by the fairness of the pub∣lic motives, and the general voice of the people. In this war his friends relied that things must necessarily be so embarrassed, that the old party would find themselves obliged to re∣tire, and to leave the stage clear for them to serve their country accord∣ing to their own plans, and on their own terms. This design was be∣lieved to be pushed forward by ano∣ther great man of that party, who had played a game nearly of the same kind before, and in whom an advanced age had not abated any thing of his natural fire and love of violent councils.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14"/>
Things came to a crisis by the taking of two French men of war by the Admirals Bos∣cawen <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 10.</NOTE> and Mostyn. The operations by land were carried on with vigour; but whether conducted with equal judgment, we stand too near the time to decide. However, the French fort at <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 16.</NOTE> Beausejour was taken, and soon after those on St. John's river were abandoned; by which we re∣mained masters of all Nova Scotia. The principal expedition was that against Fort du Quesne, under Ge∣neral Braddock. That General a∣bounding too much in his own sense for the degree of military knowledge he possessed, commanding in a country which he did not know, and carrying on a species of war in which he had no experience, suffered him∣self, when he had advanced within 10 miles of Fort du Quesne, to be surprised by an ambuscade of French and Indians. His army was seized with a panic from <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> the unusual appearance, and horrid cries of the savages; they fled in confusion; they were totally de∣feated with a considerable slaughter, especially of their officers. The Ge∣neral himself, after having five horses killed under him, was mortally wounded; wiping away all the er∣rors of his conduct by an honourable death for his country.</P>
<P>The nation was something con∣soled for this loss in the signal advan∣tage gain'd by General Johnson, who commanded the expediti∣on designed against Crown <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 7.</NOTE> Point. He was attacked in his in∣trenchments by the French General Dieskau; but the assailants wanting cannon, and firing from too great a distance, were totally defeated, and Dieskau himself was made prisoner. This victory, tho' very honourable for Mr. Johnson and the provincial troops under his command, yet, as it was gained late in the season, and as the army was in no very good condition, it had no consequences. On the whole, we seemed, after al∣lowing for this victory, and for the dislodgement of the French from Nova Scotia, to have had the worst part in the campaign; considering the sanguine expectations which had been formed, and the great superio∣rity of strength which we exerted, or were able to have exerted, in that part of the world.</P>
<P>During this summer, our court took a resolution not to wait the precarious operation of our arms in America for redress of the grievances complained of, but to strike such a blow as would at once put a securi∣ty into our hands, for the evacuat∣ing the places the enemy had forti∣fied in our territories, and disable them in the two most material points, the resources of their trade, and their seamen. Their merchant ships were every where attacked, as if war had been actually declared, and vast numbers brought into our ports. The French made all Eu∣rope resound with complaints of what they called a proceeding so un∣just, and a violation of the law of nations so flagrant and unprecedent∣ed. But, whether it was that they were really in no condition to act, or that they intended to influence the other courts in their favour, by a shew of extraordinary moderation, they contented themselves with this, and neither declared war, nor made any sort of reprisal for seve∣ral months after. At length <NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> they began to act; several bodies of troops moved to the coasts of Picar∣dy, Normandy and Britany; and all things threatened an invasion on some part of this kingdom. Under the
<PB REF="15" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
shadow of this stratagem, they got ready in the harbour of Toulon a fleet of twelve men of war of the line, with the utmost expe∣dition, which convoyed an <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18.</NOTE> army of about 11,000 men, under command of the Duke de Richlieu, to the island of Minorca.</P>
<P>In a few days they opened trenches before St. Phillp's fort. <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>This was done whilst the nation trembled under a shameful panic, too public to be concealed, too fa∣tal in its consequences to be ever forgotten. The real invasion did not lessen our fears of the imaginary one; it threw us into a confusion that suffered us to be sensible of no∣thing but our own weakness. We did not look upon ourselves suffici∣ently secured by the arrival of the Hanoverian and Hessian troops, which the same weakness had in∣duced us to call to our assistance. The ministry seemed to have been infected with the common terror; for though they had very early no∣tice of the French designs, such was the apprehension of the invasion, or such the ill-contrived disposition of our navy, that Admiral Byng was not dispatched to the Mediterranean before the 5th of April, and then with a squadron of no more than 10 ships of the line.</P>
<P>The engagement with the French fleet under M. Galissoniere; the retreat of Byng by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 12.</NOTE> the garrison of fort St. was cut off from all hopes of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip</NOTE> relief; the surrender of that garrison after nine weeks <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29.</NOTE> open trenches; the senti∣ments of the court and the pub∣lic, on the different merits of the governor and the admiral; the op∣position of some, who thought the one too highly honoured, and the other too severely censured, and the measures which rather indignation at our losses and disgraces, than a cool sense of things obliged us to take, are known to all the world. Our affairs were in such a condition that we were driven to the expedient of a court martial to revive the British spirit, and to the unfortunate neces∣sity of shedding the blood of an Admiral, a person of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 14. 1757.</NOTE> a noble family, as a sacrifice to the discipline of our navy.</P>
<P>From this melancholy picture, let us turn our eyes another way, and review the steps by which this war came to involve the rest of the con∣tending powers. The French, a∣mongst the other plans they formed for distressing our affairs, made no secret of their design of attacking his Majesty's German dominions. These countries evidently had no sort of connexion with the matters which gave rise to the war. But being un∣der a Sovereign so remarkably affec∣tionate to his native country; they judged he might be terrified into a relaxation of his rights in America, to preserve Hanover from the cala∣mities with which it was threatened. Their politics, however, in this in∣stance proved as unsuccessful as they were unjust. No motion was made towards an abatement in our claims with regard to America; his Ma∣jesty took other methods for the preservation of the peace of Ger∣many. His British subjects by their representatives, not more generously than reasonably, resolved to defend the Hanoverians if attacked in their quarrel. To answer this purpose; the ministry entered into a subsidy treaty with the Empress of Russia, in virtue of which she was to hold 55,000 men in readiness to be sent on a requisition wherever the British service required.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17"/>
The alliance with Russia was cho∣sen for reasons which were then sufficiently plausible; though it is to be hoped they can never subsist a∣gain. The long ill understanding be∣tween the King of Prussia and our court, and his close connexion with that of Versailles, raised no ill∣grounded apprehensions that he might be induced to act a dangerous part on this occasion. Russia was therefore a proper ally, who had both a political and personal enmity to this monarch, and who would be sure to employ a great power with great vi∣gour in such a cause. But this sy∣stem was in a short time totally re∣versed. The King of Prussia had been too well apprised of the close conjunction of the courts of Peters∣burg and Vienna, and of the real motive to that conjunction, to have the least design of embroiling himself with England. Matters were there∣fore very soon explained, and the treaty between his Prussian majesty and this court, to keep all foreigners out of the Empire, was signed at London in January 1756. These treaties were censured as inconsistent with each other; but in reality they were consistent enough, aiming pre∣cisely at the same object, to oppose the schemes meditated by France for disturbing the affairs of Germany.</P>
<P>If reflecting on the sentiments of these courts, there was something unexpected in the alliance between Great Britain and Prussia; it was soon followed by another alliance of a nature infinitely more surprising. The Empress Queen of Hungary, finding England in no disposition to co-operate in her designs, had re∣course to other measures. The house of Austria, which had formerly united Europe to preserve her from the power of France, now entered herself into the most intimate union with that power. By this extraor∣dinary revolution, the whole political system of Europe assumed a new face; it was indeed a revolution so extraordinary, that we shall be justi∣fied if we interrupt the course of this narrative, to look back at the causes which produced it.</P>
<P>The house of Brandenbourg, a little more than two centuries ago, was in a very humble condition. But by the part she took in the refor∣mation, which put into her hands the estates of the Teutonic order; by a marriage from which she acquir∣ed the dutchy of Cleves; and by an uncommon succession of able Princes who carefully improved eve∣ry turn in the affairs of Germany to their advantage, she raised herself by degrees to a considerable state, to an electorate, and at last to a royalty, not only in name but in power. The late King of Prussia, in order to strengthen this power, though he past almost his whole reign in the most profound peace, gave his whole attention to his army; frugal in all other respects, in this alone he was expensive; it was his bu∣siness, and what was perhaps of greater moment, it was his only di∣version. Thus in a reign apparently inactive, there was always kept up an army of near 100,000 men, in as much exercise as they could have in peace, and formed with the most per∣fect discipline.</P>
<P>When his present majesty came to the throne, he immediately shew∣ed a disposition of employing ef∣fectually that military force which his father had spent his life only in forming and training. He managed his dispute with the Bishop of Liege by the summary method of force; and seemed disposed to carry all things with so high an hand, as made him indeed much respected, but
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
much dreaded too by the Princes of the Empire, who saw that there was another power to be feared in Ger∣many, besides that of Austria. But these were small matters, rather signs of the disposition of this Prince, than exertions of it. He meditated much greater things; and only wait∣ed an opportunity to make good the antient claims of his family on the most considerable part of the dutchy of Silesia. The right to that dutchy had been a very intricate affair; but the house of Austria availing herself of the greatness of her power, and of a dissension between the Elector Frederick II. and his son, prevail∣ed with the Elector to give up that right for an equivalent; then she persuaded his son to confirm the treaty; and at the same time for a trivial consideration to give up the equivalent itself. The King of Prussia, not thinking himself bound by these acts, though con∣firmed by a long possession, took advantage of his own power and the embarrassed circumstances of the house of Austria, to resume what their power and the embarrassed circumstances of his family had formerly deprived him of. For im∣mediately on the death of Charles the 6th, when the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1740.</NOTE> Austrian greatness seemed irrecoverably lost, he entered into Silesia, and made himself master of the whole country with little opposition. Then uniting with the French and Bavarians, he secured his conquests by two decisive vic∣tories, and by a treaty which yielded him the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11, 1742.</NOTE> greatest and best part of Silesia and the whole county of Glatz. But the cause of the Emperor which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 2, 1744.</NOTE> King of Prussia had em∣braced, soon caused a renewal of hostilities; the Queen of Hungary saw herself defeated in three pitched battles; her new ally the King of Poland, driven from his German do∣minions, and the King of Prussia en∣tering Dresden in triumph, where he gave the law in a treaty, by which Silesia was once more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1745.</NOTE> solemnly confirmed to him: in return to which he guarantied to the Queen of Hungary the rest of her dominions.</P>
<P>The Queen of Hungary could not easily lose the memory of the wound she had received in the loss of one of the finest and richest parts of all her dominions. Silesia, which she had just yielded, extends in length 200 miles along the course of the large and navigable river Oder. A country of the most exquisite fertili∣ty and highest cultivation; abound∣ing with men, abounding with valu∣able manufactures, and yielding a clear yearly revenue of 800,000 pounds sterling. The peace was hardly concluded by which she re∣signed this valuable territory, than she set on foot practices for recover∣ing it. She entered into a treaty with the court of Petersbourg, of an innocent and simply defen∣sive nature, so far as ap∣peared <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 22, 1746.</NOTE> to the public; but six secret and separate articles were added to it; one of which pro∣vides, that in case his Prussian majesty should attack her majesty the Em∣press Queen; or the Empress of Rus∣sia, or even the republick of Poland, that this attack should be considered as a breach of the treaty of Dresden; that the right of the Empress Queen to Silesia ceded by that treaty should revive; and that the contracting powers should mutually furnish an army of 60,000 men to re-invest the Empress Queen with that dutchy.</P>
<P>To this so extraordinary a treaty, the King of Poland was invited to
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
accede; and he did so far accede to it, as to shew he perfectly agreed in his sentiments with these courts. But his situation in the jaws of a formidable enemy, and the experi∣ence of passed misfortunes, had ren∣dered him so wary, that he declined signing the treáty; but still, with the consent of the parties concerned, whom he fully convinced of his re∣solution to co-operate in all their measures. He desired and they a∣greed, that in the success of their arms he should have a share in the spoil, on the footing of a treaty for the eventual partition of the King of Prussia's do∣minions <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 18, 1745.</NOTE> made in the last war. On these conditions the King of Poland without actually signing, was understood, and received as a party to the treaty of Petersbourg.</P>
<P>In consequence of these measures, all sort of means were employed to embroil the King of Prussia's affairs in the north, and particularly to render him personall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>odious to the Czarina. When their machinations had taken full effect, and Russia was fixed in an unalterable enmity to that monarch, preparations of magazines and armies were made in Bohemia and Moravia; and the King of Poland, under pretence of a military amusement, drew toge∣ther about 16000 men, with which he occupied the strong and impor∣tant post of Pirna. The Queen of Hungary saw that she stood in need of yet stronger supports than these in the arduous business she had un∣dertaken. She found that Great-Britain, which had often done so much for her distress, would do little for her ambition: she therefore had recourse to France, who joyfully ac∣cepting an alliance, that promised to confound the whole Germanic body, concluded a treaty with the Empress at Versailles the 1st of May 1756, a remarkable aera in the po∣litical history of Europe.</P>
<P>The secret articles of the treaty of Petersbourg, the fountain of the pre∣sent troubles, and the steps taken to put that treaty in execution though formed and carried on with as much secrecy as earnestness, could not es∣cape the vigilance of his Prussian ma∣jesty, who watched all their motions, and had perfect intelligence of their most hidden designs. When, there∣fore, he perceived that by the breach between England and France, the Empress Queen would take advan∣tage of these troubles to avail her∣self of her alliances and her arma∣ments; he ordered his minister at Vienna to demand a clear explica∣tion, and proper assurances concern∣ing the preparations he saw making: and receiving only a dry and equi∣vocal answer, that the Empress had taken measures for her own security and that of her allies and friends, the King believed himself no longer bound to preserve any terms; a dangerous war was to be kept out of his own territories at any rate; and being always in perfect readiness for action, he fell upon Saxony with a considerable army.</P>
<P>At first the King of Prussia seemed only to demand a free pas∣sage for his troops, and an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 29.</NOTE> observance of the neutrality profes∣sed by the King of Poland; but as he had very good reasons to distrust such a neutrality, he demanded as a security, that the Saxon troops should quit the strong post they oc∣cupied, and disperse themselves immediately. This demand was re∣fused, and the King of Prussia in consequence of that refusal, imme∣diately formed a sort of blockade about the Saxon camp at Pirna, with a view to reduce it by famine,
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
since its inaccessible situation render∣ed an attack unadviseable. There were in Bohemia two Austrian ar∣mies under M. Brown and M. Picolo∣mini; to keep these in awe, M. Schwerin had entered Bohemia from the county of Glatz; and M. Keith had penetrated into that kingdom on the side of Misnia. But the King of Prussia, not entirely confiding in these dispositions; and still apprehensive that M. Brown might be able to con∣vey some relief to the Saxons, re∣solved to bring him to an action, to the success of which he knew his own presence would greatly contri∣bute. He therefore left the blockade of the Saxon army, joined his forces under Keith, and engaged the Austrians at Lowositz. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1.</NOTE> Here he obtained a victory, which though it was not undisputed with regard to the field of battle, yet with regard to the consequences it was as decisive as could be wished. M. Brown found it impracticable to relieve the Saxons, notwithstanding the judicious efforts he made for that purpose; and that army, after a vain attempt to retire from their difficult post, which had one fault, that it was as difficult to leave it as to force it, were obliged to surrender prisoners of war. The King of Poland quitted his German domini∣ons; and the Prussians took up their winter quarters in Saxony, seized upon the revenues, levied exorbitant contributions, and obliged the coun∣try to furnish recruits. This un∣happy people saw their country ex∣hausted, and forced to bear the bur∣then of a war against itself. It was then, that the King of Prussia con∣sulting the rules of policy, more than those of politeness, made himself master of the archives at Dresden, in doing which some roughness was used towards the Queen; but he made himself amends for the clamour in∣dustriously raised on this pretence, by acquiring the originals of these pieces, which evinced to the world the reality of the design against him, and which therefore in a great measure justified the means he had taken to come at them, as well as the extraordinary severities he used towards the unfor∣tunate Saxons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>State of the English ministry. The characters and designs of the several factions. A coalition. Oswego taken by the French. Calcutta taken by the Nabob. Angria reduced by Admiral Watson.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILST the King of Prussia passed the winter in the most vigorous preparations for carrying on the war, his ally Great Britain presented a very different face of things. The loss of Minorca plunged the people into the utmost grief mixed with shame, for such a blot on the national honour, and with indignation not only against those who had acted weakly, but those who had provided insufficient∣ly for the relief of that important possession. The public resentment, which at first seemed to have no other object than Byng, was soon turned against the ministry. The clamour in parliament was great; without doors it was excessive. Ad∣dresses praying a strict enquiry into the cause of our misfortunes, were presented from all parts of the king∣dom. The ministry, notwithstand∣ing this general discontent, had a
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
real strength; and they might have stood, had they agreed amongst them∣selves. The commons could not be brought to any angry votes; and the result of the enquiry into the loss of Minorca, was as favourable as they could have wished. But Mr. F—thought it not adviseable to bear a large proportion of the odium caused by counsels, in which he had little share. Perhaps, he thought this embarrassment, a situation not un∣favourable to the arrangement he had always aimed at; he therefore suddenly threw up an employment, which he hoped to resume augment∣ed with greater power.</P>
<P>On the removal of this principal prop, the whole structure of the mi∣nistry fell to pieces. The D. of N. the Ld. Ch. the first lord of the ad∣miralty resigned; and the chiefs of the party by whose manoeuvres they were displaced, naturally suc∣ceeded to the management <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4. 1756.</NOTE> of affairs. They who had resigned gave them no apparent op∣position in parliament; but whether it was, that the new ministry were themselves too fresh from opposition, and some of them too full of the po∣pular manners that introduced them to court to be perfectly agreeable in the closet, or that they had made their bottom too narrow, after hold∣ing their employments for some months, to the great concern of the public, they in their turn were obliged to quit their posts. Thus was the helm of go∣vernment <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1757.</NOTE> a second time a∣bandoned. The case of the King and the nation was at that juncture truly deplorable. We were without any ally who could do us the least service, engaged in a war hitherto unsuccessful, with the most formid∣able power in Europe; we almost despaired of our military virtue; public spirit appeared utterly extin∣guished, whilst the rage of faction burned with the utmost violence; our operations were totally suspend∣ed; and having no ministry esta∣blished, we had no plan to follow.</P>
<P>Three factions divided the ruling men of the nation, for the gross of the people seemed to have no fur∣ther views than a redress of their grievances, by whatever means that could be brought about; the first of these factions was composed of those who had grown to place and power, or had formed their con∣nexions under the old ministry. They were some of the most respectable persons in the nation, and had un∣doubtedly the greatest parliamentary interest. They had at the same time another interest hardly less consider∣able, that of the monied people; but in some points, and these ma∣terial too, they were weak. They were not at all popular; a matter of great consideration in a government like ours; and they were supposed by the gross of the people, not to be under the direction of great poli∣tical abilities.</P>
<P>The second faction, though not suspected of the want of sufficient ability, was yet more unpopular than the former; they had not at∣tempted to preserve even the appea∣rances essential to popularity; and to them the more essential, as their parliamentary strength was, how∣ever respectable, much inferior to the first. If their influence at one court was able to ballance that of the old ministry, by means of a then powerful connection, that very con∣nection made them far worse at ano∣ther court, and worse with the ge∣nerality of the people, who enter∣tained or pretended at least to enter∣tain, suspicions of a nature the more dangerous, as they were only drop∣ped
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
in hints and whispers, and never could come to a full and open expla∣nation.</P>
<P>The third party, had little par∣liamentary and less court influence; but they had a prodigious populari∣ty, which supplied every other de∣fect. The abilities of their leader were of the most shining kind; his application equal to his abilities; his disinterestedness was confessed by his enemies; and though it would have shined in the days of heroism, was now the more valued, and set off to the greater advantage by the general selfishness which prevailed among the men of business. The nation reposed the most perfect obedience in his integrity and love to his country. This party, conscious where its strength lay, cultivated with great care the popularity which was the basis of their power; even perhaps so as to impair on some occasions the dignity of government.</P>
<P>These three factions differed from each other extremely with regard to power, the grand object of all fac∣tions. But in the general scheme of their politics, the two first were pretty much agreed. Looking on France as the most constant and most dangerous enemy of Great Britain, they dreaded the increase of her power and influence among the neighbouring nations as the greatest of all evils. To prevent so danger∣ous an aggrandisement, they thought it absolutely necessary to preserve a constant attention to the ballance of power, and to seek our particular safety and liberty in the general safe∣ty and liberty of Europe. A close connection was therefore to be kept up with the powers of the conti∣nent, not only by continual negoti∣ations, but by large subsidies, and even by assisting them with our troops if the occasion should require such assistance. For this purpose, as well as to secure the more effectual∣ly our present happy establishment, a considerable regular land force ought to be constantly maintained. Our navy, they thought, ought by no means to be neglected; but it was only to be cultivated and em∣ployed subserviently to the more comprehensive continental system. These parties were far from being friends to arbitrary power, or in any sort averse to parliaments; they loved the constitution; but they were for preserving the authority of govern∣ment entire, and in its utmost lawful force. To make government more easy, knowing that many would di∣sturb it, from disaffection or disgust, or mistaken notions of liberty, they thought it just to rule men by their in∣terests if they could not by their vir∣tues, and they had long been in the practice of procuring a majority in parliament, by the distribution of the numerous lucrative places and em∣ployments which our constitution leaves in the disposal of the Crown. Several believed that no other method was practicable, considering the nature of mankind, and our particular form of government.</P>
<P>But the third and popular party, was influenced by different principles. They looked indeed on the power of France in the same light with the two former, and were of the same opinion concerning the necessity of setting bounds to it. In the means of attaining this end they differed. Our situation they thought dictated a narrower, but a more natural, a safer, and a less expensive plan of politics, than that which had been adopted by the other party. We ought never to forget, said they, that we are an island: and that this cir∣cumstance so favourable both to our political and to our civil liberty, pre∣scribes
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
to us a conduct very different from that of every other nation. Our natural strength is a maritime strength, as trade is our natural employment; these must always go hand in hand, and they mutually support each other. But, if turning our back to our real interests, and abandoning our natural element, we enter that inextricable labyrinth of continental politicks; if we make ourselves par∣ties in every controversy; if we ex∣haust our wealth in purchasing the useless and precarious friendship of every petty prince or state; if we waste the blood of our people in all the quarrels that may arise on the continent; so far from going in the right way to reduce France, that we attack her on the strong side, and only destroy ourselves by our ill judged efforts against the enemy. That we can have nothing to fear from the superiority of France on the continent, whilst we preserve our superiority at sea; that we can always cut the sinews of the enemy's strength by destroying their traffic; that to fear an invasion from a power weak in its marine, is the idlest of all fears; that in case an invasion were possible, a well trained national militia, supplying by their zeal the defects of their dis∣cipline, would prove our best pro∣tection; that a standing army is in whatever shape dangerous to free∣dom; and that a government like ours, connected by its very essence with the liberty of the subject, can never be in want of the supports of despotic power. As little is parlia∣mentary influence necessary. A go∣vernment pleasing to the people, as every good government must be, can never be generally opposed; and men need no bribes to persuade them to their duty.</P>
<P>These notions, so opposite in their extreams, might be reconciled in a medium, and used to temper each other. For as, on one hand, it would be very absurd to make no sort of advantage of our insular situation, but to engage in all the business of the continent without reserve, and to plunge ourselves into real evils out of dread of possible mischiefs; so on the other hand, to think ourselves wholly unconcerned in the fortunes of our neighbours on the continent, or to think of aiding them in any case, only by the way of diversion with our fleets, would be a way of proceeding, still more extravagant than the former. If such notions were reduced to practice, we might soon lose all these advantages derived from a situation which we abused.</P>
<P>The reasonableness of such a tem∣perament, could not be perceived during the ferment of that time, in which these topics were bandied to and fro with infinite heat. The re∣signation, or rather deprivation, of the popular ministry, only increased their popularity, and the general discontent; the people could not believe that good measures could be pursued, when those, in whom alone they confided, were not employed; almost all the corporations of the kingdom presented the deprived ministers with their freedom, and addressed them in the warmest man∣ner, testifying the most entire ap∣probation of their conduct, and the sincerest concern to see them out of employment.</P>
<P>This conflict between an old esta∣blished interest, and the torrent of popularity, continued for a long time, and the nation was almost ruined by it. It is not easy, nor perhaps quite proper, to attempt to trace the steps by which so happy a coalition, as we have seen take place, was brought about. But it was formed in such
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
manner, has held together with such solidity, and produced such excel∣lent effects, as I believe the most sanguine could not <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1757.</NOTE> have hop'd for at that time. Mr. P. was again restored to the of∣fice of secretary of state, the D. of N. was placed at the head of the treasury, Mr. F. was appointed pay∣master of the forces. This arrange∣ment, which gave very general satis∣faction, was however disliked by those, whom their violent attach∣ment to their party had inspired with a narrow and exclusive spirit. It was the best measure, because it was an healing measure; and it was little less than impossible for any particular party to carry on public business on its single bottom.</P>
<P>It was high time that our domestic dissentions should be compos'd at last. From every quarter of the world, in which we had any concern, we heard of nothing but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14. 1756.</NOTE> losses and calamities. In America we lost the Fort of Oswego. That fort, situated at the mouth of the Onondaga river, commanded a commodious harbour on the Lake Ontario. It was built by General Shirley, and designed to cover the country of the Five Nations; to secure the Indian trade; to interrupt the communication between the French northern and southern establish∣ments; and to open a way to our arms to attack the forts of Frontenac and Niagara. For these purposes, some frigates had been fitted out for cruising, and a number of boats prepared for the transportation of troops; but they all fell to the ene∣my with the fort, where 100 pieces of cannon were, and a consi∣derable quantity of provision. 1600 men were made prisoners of war. The place made but a trifling resist∣ance, scarce holding out three days; the attempts to relieve it were too late. The French demolished the fort.</P>
<P>Our losses were not confin'd to A∣merica. The E. India company recei∣ved a blow, which would have shaken an establishment of less strength to its foundations. The news of the war between France and Eng∣land had not yet reached India, but a new and very formidable enemy was raised up in that quarter. The Nabob of Bengal (the Nabobs are a species of viceroys to the Grand Mo∣gul, grown almost independent in their several provinces,) irritated at the protection given to one of his subjects in the English fort of Cal∣cutta, and, as it is said, at the refu∣sal of some duties to which he claim∣ed a right, levied a great army, and laid siege to that place. The Gover∣nor, terrified by the numbers of the enemy, abandoned the fort with se∣veral of the principal persons in the settlement, who saved themselves with their most valuable effects on board the ships.</P>
<P>Thus deserted, Mr. Hollwel, the second in command, bravely held the place to the last extremity, with a few gallant friends, and the re∣mains of a feeble garrison. A very noble defence was insufficient to keep an untenable place, or to affect an ungenerous enemy. The fort was taken, and the gar∣rison <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 26.</NOTE> being made prisoners, were thrust into a narrow dun∣geon. Hollwel, with a few others, came out alive, to paint a scene of the most cruel distress which perhaps human nature ever suffered. The East India company lost their princi∣pal settlement in Bengal, and a fort, which secured to them the most va∣luable part of their trade.</P>
<P>In the space of this unfortunate year, we were stripped of Minorca
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
and Oswego; we apprehended an invaston of Great Britain itself: our councils were torn to pieces by fac∣tions; and our military fame was every where in contempt. Amidst <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 13.</NOTE> these losses, we considered as some advantage the re∣duction of the principal fort of An∣gria, a piratical prince, who had been many years troublesome to the English trade in the East Indies. This service was performed by Ad∣miral Watson in the beginning of the year.</P>

<P>WHAT turn the English poli∣tics were like to take in the year 1757, seemed for some time uncertain. The new ministry did not seem well established; nor was it well known, whether they would pursue the plans and preserve the connections of the old. Abroad, every thing was prepared for open∣ing the campaign with the utmost eclat. All Europe was in motion.</P>
<P>France, in order to demonstrate to the Queen of Hungary, the advan∣tageous choice she had made in con∣necting herself with the house of Bourbon, formed two great armies. The first was composed of near 80,000 men, the flower of the French troops, attended with a vast artillery, and commanded by M. de Etrees, a General of the best esta∣blished reputation she had in her service. Under him served M. de Contades, M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all officers of high character, and all fit to com∣mand in chief, if M. de Etrees had not been appointed to that emi∣nence. This formidable army pas∣sed the Rhine, and marched by Westphalia, in order to invade the King of Prussia's dominions in qua∣lity of allies to the Empress Queen, and guardians of the liberties of the Empire, and to no other in∣tent, as it was pretended; but in re∣ality, with a view to reduce Hano∣ver also. They judged that their ope∣rations against the King of Prussia might be executed, and their scheme to drive the King of England into some concessions with regard to A∣merica, might be compleated by one and the same blow. The second army was commanded by the Prince de Soubise; it consisted of about 25,000 men. This army was de∣stined to strengthen the Imperial army of execution; but before it had passed the Rhine, it made itself master of Cleves, Meurs and Gueldres, whilst a detachment from d' Etrees's army seized upon the town of Emb∣den, and whatever else belonged to Prussia in East Friesland.</P>
<P>As soon as the King of Prussia had entered Saxony in the beginning of the preceding summer, process was commenced against him in the Em∣peror's Aulic council, and before the diet of the Empire. It is not difficult to conceive how the affair must have been decided; when those who feared the King of Prussia, be∣lieved they had a fair opportunity to reduce him: and when those who feared the house of Austria, were, by that very fear, obliged to
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
support the power they dreaded: accustomed as they were to the in∣fluence of a family in which the Empire had so long been in a man∣ner hereditary; and overawed by the appearance of a confederacy, the most formidable the world had ever yet seen. Accordingly the King of Prussia was condemned for contu∣macy; and the Fiscal had orders to notify to him that he was put under the ban of the Empire, and adjudged fallen from all the dignities and pos∣sessions which he held under it. The circles of the Empire were ordered to furnish their contingents of men and money to put this sentence in execution; but the contingents were collected slowly, the troops were badly composed, and probably this army had never been able to act, if it had not been for the assist∣ance afforded under the Prince de Soubise.</P>
<P>The Austrians who were princi∣pals in the quarrel, were not behind their auxiliaries in the greatness of their preparations; they made the most strenuous efforts, by which they assembled a body of upwards of 100,000 men in Bohemia, and committed the command to Prince Charles of Lorrain, assisted by M. Brown. In the north all things threatened the King of Prussia. The Czarina, true to her resentments and her engagements, had sent a body of 60,000 men commanded by M. Apraxin, who were in full march to invade the ducal Prussia, whilst a a strong fleet was equipped in the Baltick, to co-operate with that ar∣my. Although the King of Swe∣den was allied in blood and inclinati∣on to his Prussian majesty, yet the jealousy which the Senate entertained of their sovereign; the hope of re∣covering their ancient professions in Pomerania by means of the present troubles, and in fine their old attach∣ment to France newly cemented by intrigues and subsidies, made their ill inclinations to the cause of Prussia more than suspicious. Hitherto in∣deed nothing more than the tendency of their councils was fully known. The Duke of Mecklenbourg took the same party, and agreed to join the Swedish army when it should be assembled, with 6000 men; a pro∣ceeding which he has since had rea∣son to repent bitterly. Thus were the forces of five mighty states <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Austria, Russia, France, Sweden, the Empire.</NOTE>, each of which had in their turn been a terror to all Europe, united to re∣duce the heir of the Marquisses of Brandenbourg; and in such a point of danger and glory, had the great and formidable abilities of his Prus∣sian majesty placed him, with lit∣tle, in comparison, that could en∣able him to sustain the violence of so many shocks, except what those abilities supplied. But his astonishing oeconomy, the incom∣parable order of his finances, the discipline of his armies beyond all praise, a sagacity that foresaw every thing, a vigilance that attended every thing, a constancy that no labour could subdue, a courage that no danger could dismay, an intultive glance that catches the decisive mo∣ment, all these seemed to form a sort of ballance to the vast weight against him, turned the wishes of his friends into hopes, and made them depend upon resources that are not within the power of calculation.</P>
<P>The only army that appeared in his favour was a body of between 30 and 40,000 Hanoverians and Hessians, who with some reinforce∣ments of his own troops, formed an

army of observation, commanded by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland; this army was posted on the Weser, to watch the motions of M. d'Etrees. The vast and un∣wieldy body of the French, encum∣bered as the French armies always are by an immense baggage and an innumerable multitude of mouths without hands, made a very slow progress through the rough and barren country that lies between the Rhine and the Weser. All the abi∣lities of the French general were employed in finding subsistence for his troops. His Royal Highness on the other hand, displayed great a∣bilities in throwing all possible im∣pediments in his way. But when these impediments were removed by the superiority of numbers, the Hanoverian army gradually gave way, yielding to that superiority, and the French troops passed the Weser without opposition.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his Prussian majesty being determined according to his maxim, to lay the cloth as far from home as possible; made his dispositions for carrying the war in∣to Bohemia as speedily as the season would admit. Three great bodies of his troops entered into that kingdom by three very different ways, but nearly at the same time. M. Schwerin penetrated into it from Silesia. The Prince of Bevern en∣tered with the corps under his com∣mand from Lusatia, and defeated as a preliminary to a more decisive victory, a body of 28,000 Austrians who opposed him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apr. 21.</NOTE> The King himself prepared to enter Bohemia at a great distance from the corps commanded by these generals; and as he seemed disposed to march towards Egra, the enemy imagined he intended to execute some design distinct from the object of his other armies. With this idea they de∣tached a body of 20,000 men, to observe his motions. The King of Prussia finding that this feint had all its effect, made a sudden and mas∣terly movement to his left, by which he cut off all communication be∣tween that detachment and the main army of the Austrians. Spirited with this advantage, he pushed on∣wards with the utmost rapidity to Prague, where he joined the corps under the Prince of Bevern and M. Schwerin, who had advanced with inconceivable diligence to meet him. Never were operations executed with more judgment, celerity and success.</P>
<P>The Austrian army was little short of 100,000 men, and the situation of their <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 6.</NOTE> camp, fortified by every advantage of nature, and every contrivance of art, such as on common occasi∣ons might justly be considered as impregnable; but the Prussians, be∣ing nearly as numerous as the ene∣my, inspired by a society of danger with their King, and filled with that noble enthusiasm, which, whilst it urges to daring enterprises, almost ensures their success, passed mo∣rasses, climbed precipices, faced batteries, and after a bloody and obstinate resistance, totally defeated the Austrians. They took their camp, military chest, cannon, all the trophies of a complete victory. The loss on the side of the vic∣tor, as well as the vanquished, was very great; but both sides had yet a greater loss in the death of two of the best Generals in Europe. M. Schwerin was killed at the age of eighty-two, with the colonel's standard in his hand at the head of his regiment. M. Brown received a wound, which, from the chagrin he suffered rather than from its own nature, proved mortal.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="28"/>
About 40,000 of the Austrian ar∣my took refuge in Prague. The rest fled different ways. The King of Prussia lost no time to invest the place, and to cut off all succours. If on one hand such an immense garrison made an attack unadvisea∣ble, on the other that formidable number itself seemed to make the reduction of the place by famine the more certain. The King of Prussia not relying solely on this, prepared to bombard the town. On the 29th of May, at midnight, after a most dreadful storm of rain and thunder, as if it were to display how much more ruinous the malice of men may be, than the greatest terrors of nature, on the signal of a rocket, four batteries, which dis∣charged every twenty-four hours two hundred and eighty-eight bombs, besides a vast multitude of red hot balls, began to pour destruction on that unfortunate city, which was soon in flames in every part. The garrison made a vigorous defence, and one well conducted and despe∣rate sally: but they were repulsed with great loss. The principal ma∣gistrates, burghers, and clergy, see∣ing their city on the point of being reduced to an heap of rubbish, made the most moving supplications to the commander to listen to terms. The commander was deaf to their prayers. Twelve thousand of the most useless mouths were driven out of the city. The Prussians forced them in again. The affairs of the Empress seemed verging to inevitable destruction; a whole army was upon the point of surrendering prisoners of war; the capital of Bohemia on the point of being taken, and with it all the rest of that flourishing kingdom. The sanguine friends of the King of Prussia began to compute the distance to Vienna.</P>
<P>In this desperate situation of af∣fairs, Leopold Count Daun entered on the stage, and began to turn the fortune of the war. This General never had commanded in chief be∣fore; but he was formed, by a long course of experience in various parts of Europe, under the greatest Gene∣rals and in the most illustrious scenes of action. Though of a very noble family, he had without the least assistance from court favour, risen insensibly by the slow gradation of mere merit, with much esteem and without any noise. This General arrived within a few miles of Prague, the day after the great battle. He collected the fugitive parties of the Austrian army, and retired to a post of great strength, from whence he fed the troops in Prague with hopes of relief. But as no man better un∣derstood the superiority of the Prus∣sian troops, and as he was sensible of the impression which the late defeat had left upon his men, he carefully avoided to precipitate mat∣ters by an hasty action. He knew that the situation he had chosen would embarrass the Prussians; that a large party of their army must be always employed to watch him; that this would weaken their efforts against the great body shut up in Prague, whilst his own forces gained time to recover their spirits, and to increase in strength by the daily succours, which his court exerted all their powers to send him: with these ideas he waited in his entrenched camp at Colin, to act as events should direct.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia was not less sensible than Count Daun of the ef∣fect of this conduct. He determin∣ed at all adventures to dislodge him from the post he held; but whether it was that the King feared to weak∣en his army, which had actually an
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
army to besiege, or whether he was blinded by a train of uniform suc∣cess, which made him believe his arms irresistible under every disad∣vantage, or whatever were his mo∣tives or necessities, the whole army employed in this undertaking, in∣cluding the Prince of Bevern's corps, did not exceed 32,000 men, caval∣ry and infantry; and with these he was to attack 60,000 men, in one of the strongest situ∣ations <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18.</NOTE> which could be chosen, and defended by a vast train of artillery. Whatever the most impetuous and well regulated courage, whatever an ardor inspired by the remem∣brance of so many victories could do towards overcoming every kind of disadvantage, was done by the Prussians on this occasion. They returned to the attack seven times: in none of their victorious battles had their bravery been more con∣spicuous. Both the King's bro∣thers were in the field; and they did every thing that could be ex∣pected from the King of Prussia's brothers. The King himself at the head of his cavalry, made one furious and concluding charge. E∣very thing was tried, and every thing was unsuccessful. The want of a sufficiently numerous infantry, in a ground where his cavalry could not support them, the want of an e∣qual artillery, the advantageous situ∣ation of the enemy, their numbers, their bravery, their General, obliged the King of Prussia to quit the field. What his loss was is not so certain; it was undoubtedly great in the ac∣tion, but still greater by desertions, and the innumerable ill consequences that follow a defeat.</P>
<P>Though the King of Prussia was defeated in this battle, and though he brought on his defeat, in a great mea∣sure, by some errors of his own, yet whatever small blemish his military skill might have suffered, his repu∣tation was raised higher than ever, in the opinion of all judicious men, by the noble and candid manner in which he acknowledged his mis∣take, by the firmness with which he bore his misfortune, and by those astonishing strokes of genius and heroism, by which he retriev∣ed his loss. The smiles of fortune make conquerors; it is her malice which discovers heroes.</P>

<P>NEVER was the old observa∣tion, <HI>une bataille perdue a un mauvais cu,</HI> more verified than in the consequences of the unfortunate battle of Colin. Though the King retired unpursued by his enemies, he was obliged to rejoin his own army before Prague without delay, and to raise the blockade of that place. The imprisoned Austrians with joy received Count Daun their deliverer, and their united forces became greatly superior to the Prussians. The King was in a short time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in Saxony. The
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
Austrians harassed him as much as possible; but their armies, notwith∣standing their great superiority, were not in a condition from their late suf∣ferings to make any decisive attempt upon him, as the frontiers of Saxony a∣bound with situations easily defended.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia's misfortunes now poured in upon him at once, and from every quarter. The army commanded by the Duke of Cum∣berland, who continually retired be∣fore the French, after they had passed the Weser, came however to a reso∣lution to make a stand at Hastenbeck, within a few miles of Hammelen, where it was judged that the superior numbers of the enemy might be the least prejudicial; but notwithstand∣ing the advantage of the situation, the bravery of the Hanoverians, and the conduct of the Duke, the allied army was driven from the field of battle, and retreated towards Stade. By taking this route <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> his Royal Highness was driven into a sort of <HI>cul de sac.</HI> Unable by his situ∣ation to retire, or by his strength to advance, he was compelled to sign the remarkable capitulation of Closter-seven, by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 8.</NOTE> Hanoverians laid down their <NOTE PLACE="marg">38000</NOTE> arms, and were dispersed into diffe∣rent quarters of cantonment. The French army had a little be∣fore this changed its com∣mander. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 6.</NOTE> D'Etrees, the favourite of all the military men, was removed from the command, which was con∣ferred on the Duke de Richlieu, who excelled him and all mankind in the profession of a courtier. The Ha∣noverians were now quite subdued, and all the French force, let loose by this treaty, was ready to fall in upon the King of Prussia's domi∣nions.</P>
<P>An enterprize was concerted in England against the coast of France, to make a diversion in his favour, by drawing a part of the French army to the defence of their own country. England proposed to com∣pass another great design, and which she had equally at heart, by the ex∣pedition, which was to give an effectual blow to the marine of France. The destination of this ar∣mament was kept a profound se∣cret, and whilst it exercised the pe∣netration of all the politicians of Eu∣rope, it filled France with the most serious alarms. The English fleet at last appeared before Roch∣fort. Some time was spent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 21.</NOTE> before it could be resolved what plan was to be followed in the attack; at last it was resolved to secure the small isle of Aix, from whence some ob∣struction was apprehended to their landing. The island was soon redu∣ced; but as a good deal of time was consumed in these deliberations and actions, the militia of the country had time to gather, and there was an appearance of two camps on the shore. The commanders now took into consideration the badness of the coast, the danger of landing, the time the enemy had to put the place in such a posture of defence, as might make any sudden attempt, or <HI>coup de main,</HI> unsuccessful: in consequence of these deliberations, they unanimously resolved to return without making <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 29.</NOTE> any attempt. The disappoint∣ment of the nation was equal to the sanguine hopes we had con∣ceived; nothing could exceed the general discontent. The mi∣litary men blamed the plan of the expedition. The Ministers, and with them the public voice, ex∣claimed at the execution. A <HI>court of enquiry,</HI> of officers of reputation, censured the commander; a <HI>court∣martial,</HI> of officers of reputation,
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
acquitted him. The expedition serv∣ed only in England to increase and imbitter our dissentions, and to turn our attention to vain disputes. It did nothing towards relieving the King of Prussia.</P>
<P>The Russians, who had made for a long time a dilatory march, and seemed uncertain of their own reso∣lutions, all at once hastened their motions. They entered the Ducal Prussia under M. Apraxin and Ge∣neral Fermer, and marked their progress by a thousand inhuman cruelties. A large body of Austri∣ans entered Silesia, and penetrated as far as Breslau. Then they made a turn backwards, and laid siege to the important fortress of Schweid∣nitz, justly considered as the key of that dutchy, which was the cause of the war. Another body enter∣ed Lusatia, and made themselves masters of Zittau. Twenty-two thousand Swedes pierced into the Prussian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and laid the whole country under contribu∣tion. Richlieu, freed from all op∣position on the side of Hanover, made his way into Halberstad, and the old marche of Brandenburg, first exacting contributions, and then plundering the towns. The army of the Empire, reinforced by that of Prince de Soubise, after many delays, was at last on full march to enter Saxony; this left the Austrians at liberty to turn the greatest part of their forces to the reduction of Silesia. General Haddick pierced through Lusatia, passed by the Prussian armies, and, suddenly pre∣senting himself before the gates of Berlin, laid the King of Prussia's capital under contribution; and though he retired on the approach of a body of Prussians, yet he still kept possession of his former post, in order to interrupt the communica∣tion of the King with Silesia. The fate which seemed to have threat∣ened the Empress some months ago, was now looked upon as the cer∣tain lot of her antagonist. All his endeavours to retrieve his affairs had hitherto been equally brave and unsuccessful. General Lehwald had orders at any hazard to engage the Russians: with thirty thousand he attacked double that number strongly entrenched, at a place called Norkitten; but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 30.</NOTE> after several of those won∣derful efforts, which the Prussians alone know how to make, he was compelled to retire; but he retired in excellent order, without being pursued, having killed five times more of the enemy, than he had lost of his own men, and more for∣midable after his defeat, than the Russians after their victory. The King of Prussia exerted himself upon every side; his enemies almost al∣ways fled before him; but whilst he pursued one body, another gained in some other part upon him, and the winter came on fast, as his strength decayed, and his adversaries mul∣tiplied from every quarter. The following letter, which appeared in the public papers about this time, paints the condition of that di∣stressed monarch, in so full a man∣ner, that I shall attempt no other de∣scription of it.</P>
<P>"Many persons, who saw the King of Prussia, when he passed lately through Leipsic, cannot express how much he is altered. They say he is so much worn away, that they scarce knew him. This, indeed, is not to be wondered at; he hath not a body of iron, like Charles XII. and he endures as great fa∣tigues as he did. He is as much on horseback as Charles was, and
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
often lies upon the ground. His inward sufferings cannot be less than his outward: let us cast our eyes on a map of the Prussian domi∣nions; and measure what he hath left of the many fair possessions he had in the month of April last, of which a space of seven months hath stript him. Whence can he have men? he is shut out from the Empire; and from whence can be draw money? the dutchy of Guel∣ders, the dutchy of Cleves, the principality of Moers, the county of Lingen, the county of Lipstadt, the principality of Minden, East-Friesland, Embden, and its infant company, part of the archbishop∣rick of Magdeburgh, some other parts of the marche, Ducal Pomera∣nia, a great part of Silesia, a great part of the kingdom of Prussia, Berlin itself, almost all his domi∣nions, in short, are either taken from him, or laid under contribu∣tion, and possessed by his enemies, who collect the publick revenues, fatten on the contributions, and with the money which they draw from the electorate of Hanover, and other conquests defray the ex∣pences of the war. This picture certainly differs greatly from that which the King of Prussia might have sketched out, the day he took arms to enter Saxony. Add to this the Duke of Cumberland's conven∣tion, which deprived him of all his allies, and left him without any assistance whatever, excepting four or five hundred thousand pounds sterling, which the British parlia∣ment may give him. Add likewise some domestic uneasinesses."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Battle of Rosbach. Schweidnitz taken by the Austrians. Prince of Bevern attacked in his entrenchments. Breslau taken by the Austrians. King of Prussia marches to Silesia. The Battle of Lissa. Breslau retaken. Au∣strians driven out of Silesia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS was the King of Prussia's situation, when the will of Providence, and his own wonder∣ful abilities, as wonderfully chang∣ed the scene. His majesty deferred to bring on a decisive action, dis∣tressed as his affairs were, until the approach of winter; had he march∣ed to attack the Imperial army, whilst it was at a considerable di∣stance, he must either have left Saxony exposed to the insults of the Austrian parties, or have greatly weakened his own forces employed in the principal action. He therefore suffered the army of the Empire to advance to the frontiers of Misnia, and even to threaten the siege of Leipsic, before he began to act against them: he however moved towards them, leaving an army in Lusatia to observe the Austri∣ans. On his first motions, the enemy retired with precipitation. But when they had reinforced themselves with numbers and courage sufficient to per∣suade them to advance, the King of Prussia in his turn retired. His reso∣lution seemed to have been to fight as near Misnia as possible, and as deep in the winter as he conveniently might; for if he should have the good for∣tune to succeed against the Imperial army, such a blow, at such a season, would effectually disable them from acting any thing to his prejudice, for that year at least; but if, on the contrary, he should fail, Saxony
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
was at hand, in which it would prove difficult for the enemy to make any impression whilst the winter continued. As for the time to be lost by following this plan, and the advantage it would afford the Austrians in their designs on Silesia, they were not to be com∣pared with the advantages which the King received from it. He knew that Schweidnitz was strong, and excellently provided; the Prince of Bevern was strongly posted near it to obstruct the enemy's ope∣rations; the winter would lean hea∣vier on the besiegers; and on the whole, he had reason to trust that his troops, animated by his own presence and example, would prove far superior to the enemy, in endur∣ing all the hardships of a winter cam∣paign.</P>
<P>After some time spent in various movements, between the allied army of the Imperialists and French on one side, and the Prus∣sians on the other, the King resolv∣ed to give battle to his enemies, who were now advanced to the confines of Misnia. On the 24th of October, the King had taken his resolution; at that time his ar∣my happened to be divided into several corps, some of them at a distance of no less than twenty leagues asunder; yet such were the spirit and excellent disposition of the Prussians, that the junction of all these corps was fully effected on the 27th, and the King advanced towards the enemy. The enemy fell back at his approach, and repassed the Sala; they were followed close. The two armies met near the village of Rosbach. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>The united army, commanded by the Prince of Saxe Hilburghausen and the Prince of Soubise, was 50,000 men compleat. But the troops of the Circles were new raised, and many of them not well affected to the service, nor to their French allies. The Prussians did not amount to 25,000; but then they were Prussians, and led on by the King of Prussia. As soon as the armies were formed, and the battle going to begin, which was to de∣cide the fate of so many nations, and to determine between force and virtue, the King of Prussia addressed his troops nearly in the following words.</P>
<P><Q>“My dear friends, the hour is come, in which all that is, and all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon the swords which are now drawn for the battle. Time permits me to say but lit∣tle; nor is there occasion to say much. You know that there is no labour, no hunger, no cold, no watching, no danger, that I have not shared with you hither∣to; and you now see me ready to lay down my life with you, and for you. All I ask, is the same pledge of fidelity and af∣fection that I give. And let me add, not as an incitement to your courage, but as a testimony of my own gratitude, that from this hour, until you go into quarters, your pay shall be dou∣ble. Acquit yourselves like men, and put your confidence in God.”</Q> The effect of this speech was such as cannot be described. The general emotion burst in an universal shout, and the looks and demeanor of the men were animat∣ed to a sort of heroic phrensy. In this disposition, which prognosti∣cated the success, the engagement began.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the action, the French cavalry came on with great spirit, but they were repulsed;
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
some regiments having gained an e∣minence defended themselves brave∣ly, but in the end they were to∣tally routed. The infantry, both French and Imperialists, made but a faint resistance. The King of Prussia in person exposed to the hottest fire, led on his troops; the enemy gave way in every part; they were seized with a panic, and fled in the utmost disorder. They left 3000 men dead on the field of battle; 63 pieces of can∣non, many colours. Eight French Generals, 250 officers of different ranks, and 6000 private men were taken. Night alone saved from total destruction the scattered re∣mains of an army that in the morn∣ing was so numerous and so for∣midable.</P>
<P>I have not undertaken on this, nor shall I undertake upon any o∣ther occasion, in these prelimina∣ry chapters, to enter into the de∣tail of all the various manoeuvres of every battle; they are matters little understood by, and little in∣teresting to, the generality of rea∣ders. Besides the accounts are some∣times inaccurate, and seldom or never consistent with each other.</P>
<P>The glorious success of the battle of Rosbach, was such as hardly wanted to be improved; the enemy was left totally incapable of action. The King was set free on that side; but it was a freedom which gave him no respite from his labours; it only gave him an opportunity of undergoing new labours in another part. The Austrians had a vast force, and had now begun to make a proportionable progress in Silesia. The dependence which the King had upon the fidelity of his Generals there, seemed shaken by something which then appeared, and still seems ambiguous in their conduct. The Austrians after a siege from the 27th of October to the 11th of November, carried on under infinite difficulties and with a prodigious loss, had re∣duced Schweidnitz, and obliged the Prussian garrison of 4000 men to surrender prisoners of war. Soon after, as they had intelligence of the victory of Rosbach, and knew that the King of Prussia was on full march to the relief of Silesia, the Austrians resolved to lose no time to attack the Prince of Bevern in his strong camp under the walls of Breslau. A treble superiority incited them to this attempt. They attacked the Prince's army with great resolution, and their attack was sus∣tained with amazing in∣trepidity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22.</NOTE> The slaughter of the Aus∣trians was prodigious. A great part of their army had retired from the field of battle, and the rest were pre∣paring to retire; when all at once the Prussian Generals unexpectedly took the same resolution. A part of their army had suffered a great deal in the engagement. They became appre∣hensive of a total defeat in case their intrenchments should be forced in any part. With these ideas they retreat∣ed from the strong post they occu∣pied, and retired behind the Oder. The Austrians returning, with asto∣nishment saw themselves masters of the field of battle, which they had but just been obliged to relinquish. What is remarkable, and what gave rise to many conjectures, the Prince of Bevern going to reconnoitre with∣out escort, and attended only by a groom, was taken two days after the battle by an advanced party of Croats, a small body of whom had crossed the Oder.</P>
<P>This advantage, though dearly bought, was immediately followed with many others. Breslau the capital of Silesia imme∣diately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24.</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
surrendered, where, as well as at Schweidnitz, they found vast stores of provision, ammunition and money. All Silesia was on the point of falling into their hands. Fortune seems every where to have thrown the King of Prussia's affairs into dis∣traction, in order to raise, and as it were to round his glory in establish∣ing them; and to have been even so jealous of his honour as not to per∣mit his own excellent generals and incomparable troops to triumph any where but in his own presence.</P>
<P>The King immediately after the battle of Rosbach, with those troops which he had a few days before col∣lected from places an hundred miles distant from each other, began a march of upwards of two hundred more, and led them from engaging one superior army, to engage ano∣ther still more superior; from dan∣ger to hardship, and from hardship to renewed danger. In a most ra∣pid march he passed through Thu∣ringia, through Misnia, through Lusatia, in spite of the efforts of the Generals Haddick and Marshal, who were posted in Lusatia to ob∣struct him; and entering Silesia arrived the 2d of December at Parchwitz upon the Oder. Here he was joined by the Prince of Bevern's corps who crossed that river to meet him.</P>
<P>About this time an incident hap∣pened which was very remarkable; one of these agreeable adventures that relieve the mind amidst the per∣petual horror that attends a narra∣tive of battles and bloodshed. The garrison of Schweidnitz had seen, with the greatest reluctance, the capitulation which bound their hands from the service of their King and country. Whilst the Austrians were conducting them to prison, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their master had gained at Rosbach; animated with this news, they unanimously rose upon the escort which conducted them, and which happened not to be very strong, and entirely dispersed it. Thus freed, they marched on not very certain of their way, in hope to rejoin some corps of the Prussian troops. The same fortune which freed them, led them directly to the army commanded by the King him∣self, which was hastening to their relief. Great was the joy on both sides at this unexpected meeting, for the prisoners had heard nothing of his majesty's march. This little in∣cident, whilst it added a considerable strength to the army, added like∣wise to its spirit, and seemed an hap∣py omen of success in the future engagement.</P>
<P>As his Prussian majesty approach∣ed to Breslau, the Austrians con∣siding in their superiority, abandon∣ed their strong camp (the same which had been, occupied by the Prince of Bevern) and resolved to give the King battle. He was marching with the utmost diligence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5.</NOTE> not to disappoint them; and they met near the village of Leuthen. The ground which the Austrians occupied was very advantageous, and every advantage of the situ∣ation was improved to the utmost, by the diligence and skill of Count Daun; who remembering that he was the only General who had ever carried the field from the King of Prussia, knew better than any body how difficult it was to ob∣tain such a victory. All the dis∣positions were made accordingly; the ground they occupied was a plain, except that in some parts it had small eminences; these they sur∣rounded with artillery; the ground was also interspersed with thickets,
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>
which they sought to turn to their advantage. On their right and left were hills on which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in their front was intersected by many causeways; and to make the whole more impracticable, the Austrians had felled a vast many trees, and scattered them in the way. The King of Prussia was not terrified with this situation, nor with the consciousness that above 70,000 excellent troops, commanded by Count Daun, were so posted. The Prussians, who did not exceed, as it is said, 36,000 men, attacked them with their usual resolution. It was almost impossible, at the beginning of the engagement, for the Prussian horse to act, on account of the im∣pediments we have just mentioned, but a most judicious disposition of the King himself overcame that dis∣advantage; he had in his first dis∣positions placed four battalions be∣hind the cavalry of his right wing, foreseeing that General Nadasti, who was placed with a corps de reserve on the enemy's left, designed to take him in flank. It happened as he had foreseen; that General's horse attacked the King's right wing with great fury; but he was received with so severe a fire from the four battali∣ons, that he was obliged to retire in disorder. Then the Kings flank well covered and supported was enabled to act with such order and vigour, that the enemy's right was obliged to give way. The Prussian artillery, which was incomparably served, and silenced that of the enemy, con∣curred to maintain the King's in∣fantry, and to enable them to act in grounds where their horse could give them but little assistance. The Austrians made a gallant resistance during the whole battle. The panic of the enemy did nor here, as at Ros∣bach, do half the business; every foot of ground was well disputed. The Austrians rallied all their forces about Leuthen, which was defended upon all sides with intrenchments and redoubts. After reiterated attacks made with the utmost impetuosity, and sustained with great firmness, the Prussians mastered the post; then the Austrians fled on all parts; they were entirely routed. The King pursued them to Lissa. 6000 of the Austrians were slain, 15,000 were made pri∣soners; and an immense artillery, up∣wards of 200 pieces of cannon, were taken.</P>
<P>This great and decisive action was fought on the very same day of the the next month after the no less im∣portant and decisive battle of Ros∣bach. The consequences that fol∣lowed the action of Leuthen, declar∣ed the entireness of the victory. Notwithstanding the rigour of the season, the siege of Breslau was im∣mediately undertaken, and prose∣cuted with such spirit, that by the 29th of December it surrendered; and with it surrendered the garrison of 13,000 men prisoners of war; the blockade of Schweidnitz was formed as closely as the inclemency of the winter would permit; whilst the Prussian parties not only repossessed those parts of Silesia which belonged to the King, but penetrating into the Austrian division, reduced Ja∣gerndorf, Troppau, and Tetschen, and left to the Empress Queen, ex∣cept a forlorn garrison in Schweid∣nitz, no sort of footing in that country, in which a few days before she reckoned her dominion perfectly established.</P>

<P>AS the misfortunes of his Prus∣sian Majesty, after the battle of Colin, came on him all at once, so his successes, after his victories at Rosbach and Lissa, flowed upon him all at once likewise, and in a full tide. The Russians, though they had repulsed General Lehwald, suf∣fered so much in that action, and their barbarous method of making war had so destroyed the country, that they seemed to themselves to have no way of safety left but in re∣tiring out of the Prussian territories. This extraordinary retreat of so great an army, and so lately victori∣ous, and still possessed of a good sea∣port in the country, could scarcely be accounted for on those motives we have assigned, and astonished all Eu∣rope, whilst it left Gen. Lehwald at liberty to turn his arms into Pome∣rania against the Swedes. The Swedes on this occasion did nothing worthy of their ancient military same; but every where retiring, left the Prussians an easy conquest, not only of the Prussian but of eve∣ry part of the Swedish Pomerania, excepting the port of Stralsund; they left their allies of Mecklenbourg quite exposed to all the resentment of the King of Prussia, who chastised them with the most severe contri∣butions and levies. The French, who had been ravaging the old marche of Brandenburg, evacuated that country immediately after the battle of Rosbach. But one of the greatest revolutions of fortune in the war, and one of the most glori∣ous and important consequences of that victory, was, that the Hanove∣rian troops were enabled to resume their arms.</P>
<P>From the moment the capitula∣tion of Closter-seven was signed, the Duke de Richlieu, who came to the command only to reap the ad∣vantage, and fully the honour of an∣other's conquest, seemed to think of nothing but how to repair, from the plunder of the unhappy Ha∣noverians, the fortune which he had shattered by a thousand vices. The most exorbitant contributions were levied with the most inflexible se∣verity; every exaction, which was submitted to, only produced a new one still more extravagant; and all the orderly methods of plunder did not exempt them from the pillage, licentiousness, and insolence of the French soldiery. However, in ju∣stice to merit, we must except from this general charge the conduct of the Duke de Randan, Governor of Hanover for the French; who saved the capital of the electorate from utter ruin by the strictness of all his discipline, by the prudence, the ju∣stice and moderation of all his con∣duct; a conduct which does more real honour to his name, than the most splendid victories.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu's rapaci∣ousness and oppression, whilst they leaned so heavily on the conquered people, did the conquering army no kind of service. Intent only on plunder, which he did not confine to the enemy, he relaxed every part of military discipline; and that numerous army which M. d' Etrees

had sustained, and brought in health and spirits through the dismal de∣sarts of Westphalia, under all the opposition of a skilful adversary, were now, in full peace, in the quiet pos∣session of a conquered and plentiful country, reduced in their numbers, decayed in their health and their spirits, without cloaths, without subsistence, without order, without arms. In this condition they began at last to perceive that the Hanove∣rians, with the yoke of the capitula∣tion about their necks, were still formidable. As they had broke almost every article of that treaty, they made no scruple to add another breach in order to secure them in all the rest. They attempted ac∣tually to take their arms from the Hanoverian and Hessian troops. These gallant troops, who had with a silent grief and indignation seen the distresses of their ruined country, were ravished to find that the vic∣tory at Rosbach encouraged their sovereign to resent at last this and all the other indignities they had suf∣fered. They began to collect and to act, and under the command of the gallant Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, reinforced with a body of Prussian troops, they broke from their confinement. They reduced the town of Harburg, and laid close siege to the castle, which it must be owned was defended very brave∣ly. In all other respects the French did not seem in a condition to main∣tain their ground any where. Those troops, which a few months before had so submitted as to make it ne∣cessary to declare that they were <HI>not prisoners of war</HI> in order to explain their condition, were now on the point of pushing their adversaries to almost the same streights. Such was the force of French military dis∣cipline, and such the triumphs of Voltaire's hero.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia now saw the full effect of his counsels and his labours. His dominions were freed; his allies were enabled to assist him; and his enemies defeated, broken, and flying every where before him. In what light posterity will view these things is uncertain; we, under whose eyes, as we may say, they were atchieved, scarcely believed what we had seen. And perhaps in all the records of time, the compass of a single year, on the scene of a single country, never contained so many striking events, never display∣ed so many revolutions of fortune; revolutions not only beyond what might have been expected, but far beyond what the most sagacious foresight, reasoning from experience, and the nature of things, could pos∣sibly have imagined. The King of Prussia at first triumphant: the whole power of the Austrians to∣tally defeated; their hopes utterly ruined: then their affairs suddenly re∣established, their armies victori∣ous, and the King of Prussia in his turn hurled down; defeated; aban∣doned by his allies; surrounded by his enemies; on the very edge of despair: then all at once raised be∣yond all hope, he sees the united Austrain, Imperial, and French power levelled with the ground. 40,000 Hanoverians, a whole army, submit to 80,000 French, and are only <HI>not</HI> prisoners of war. The French are peaceable masters of all the country between the Weser and the Elbe: anon, these subdued Hanoverians resume their arms; they recover their country, and the French in a little time think them∣selves not secure to the eastward of the Rhine. 500,000 men in action. Six pitched battles fought. Three great armies annihilated. The French army reduced and vanquish∣ed
<PB N="28" REF="40"/>
without fighting. The Rus∣sians victorious, and flying as if they had been vanquished. A con∣federacy, not of smaller potentates to humble one great power, but of five the greatest powers on earth to reduce one small potentate; all the force of these powers exerted and baffled. It happened as we have related; and it is not the his∣tory of a century, but of a single campaign.</P>

<P>WITH regard to the part we had in the transactions of this year, though it was not so full of striking events, nor does it af∣ford such a splendid subject for nar∣rative, yet it is as interesting to an English reader, and may perhaps prove more instructive; as it shews us in so strong a light, the miserable consequences of our political divisi∣ons, which produced a general un∣steadiness in all our pursuits, and infused a languor and inactivity into all our military operations. For, whilst our commanders abroad knew not who were to reward their services or punish their neglects, and were not assured in what light even the best of their actions would be con∣sidered, (having reason to apprehend that they might not be judged of as they were in themselves, but as their appearances might answer the end of some ruling faction;) they naturally wanted that firm∣ness and that enterprizing re∣solution, without which the best ca∣pacity, and intentions the most honest, can do nothing in war. The attachment of most men to their parties, weakened their affection to their country. It has been imagined that ministers did not always wish success even to their own schemes, lest obnoxious men should acquire credit by the execution of them; as it was suspected that officers even at the expence of their own reputation, did not exert their faculties to the ut∣most, lest a disagreeable ministerial system should establish the credit of its counsels by the vigour of their operations. For my own part, I think that these refinements, in which there is often as much malice dis∣covered as penetration, have car∣ried the matter infinitely too far. But certain it is, that the spirit of personal parties and attachments, never carried to greater lengths than at that time, proved of very bad consequence, if it had no other ef∣fect than to raise and to give a colour to such suspicions as we have just mentioned. Whatever was the cause, it is most certain, that our success in America this year, no more answered to the greatness of our preparations and our hopes than it did in the two preceding.</P>
<P>The attack upon Crown Point, which had been a principal object of our attention in the beginning, seemed at this time to be laid aside; and an expedition to Louisbourg, un∣doubtedly a more considerable ob∣ject in itself, supplied its place. Lord Loudon was to command the
<PB N="29" REF="41"/>
land forces in this expedition; Ad∣miral Holborn the navy. The for∣mer left New York with a body of 6000 men, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> sailed to Halifax, where he was joined by the latter, who had sailed from Corke on the 7th of May with a considerable fleet, and much the same number of land forces, which his lordship had brought from New York. When the united armies and fleets were on the point of departing for Louisbourg, news arrived at Halifax, that the Brest fleet consist∣ing of seventeen ships of the line be∣sides frigates, with great supplies of military stores, provisions, and men, were arrived at the harbour which they were preparing to attack. This news immediately suspended their preparations Councils of war were held one after another. The result of the whole was, that as the place was so well reinforced, the fleet of the French rather superior to our navy, and the season so far advan∣ced, it was the more prudent course to defer the enterprise to a more favourable opportunity. This resolution seems to have been the most eligible in their circumstances, because the council of war was al∣most unanimous in it.</P>
<P>Lord London returned to New-York, and the Admiral now freed from the care of the transports set sail for Louisbourg, in hopes as it was said, of drawing the French fleet to an engagement. But upon what grounds this hope was conceived, I confess I cannot see; as it could not be imagined, that the French fleet having no sort of occasion to fight in order to protect Louisbourg, would chuse out of a bravado to bring on an unnecessary battle. However it was, the English squadron continued to cruize off that harbour until the 25th of September, when they were overtaken by a terrible storm, in which one of our ships was lost, eleven dismasted, and the rest re∣turned to England in a very shat∣tered condition. This was the end of the expedition to Louisbourg from which so much was expected. But it was not the worst consequence which attended it.</P>
<P>Since Oswego had been taken, the French remained entirely masters of all the lakes, and we could do nothing to obstruct their collecting the Indians from all parts, and ob∣liging them to act in their favour. But our apprehensions, (or what shall they be called?) did more in favour of the French than their con∣quests. Not satisfied with the loss of that important fortress, we our∣selves abandoned to the mercy of the enemy all the country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who preserved even the ap∣pearance of friendship to us. The forts we had at the Great carrying Place were demolished; Wood Creek was industriously stopped up and filled with logs; by which it became evident to all those who knew that country, that our com∣munication with our allied Indians was totally cut off; and what was worse, our whole frontier left per∣fectly uncovered to the irruption of the enemies savages, who soon a∣vailed themselves of our errors. For after the removal of these barriers, and the taking of fort William-Henry, of which we shall speak presently, they destroyed with fire and sword the fine settlements which we pos∣sessed on the Mohawks river and on those grounds called the German flats. Thus with a vast increase of our forces, and the clearest superi∣ority over the enemy, we only a∣bandoned our allies, exposed our people, and relinquished a large and valuable tract of country. The
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>
French soon made us feel effectually the want of what we had lost, and what we had thrown away.</P>
<P>A considerable fort called Fort William-Henry, had been built on the southern edge of the Lake George, in order to command that lake, and to cover our frontiers; a garrison of 2500 men defended it. General Webb with about 4000 men was posted at no great distance. No sooner had the French learned that my Lord Loudon with the body of the army was gone on the Louis∣bourg expedition, than they pre∣pared to take advantage of his ab∣sence. They drew together all the forces which they had at Crown-Point, Ticonderoga, and the adja∣cent posts; they added a consider∣able body of Canadians, and a greater number of Indians than they had ever yet employed; the whole made near 8000 men. With these and a very good artillery, Monsieur Montcalm prepared to be∣siege Fort William-Henry. It is said that the advances of this commander were not made with so much secrecy as to prevent General Webb from having early intelligence of his mo∣tions; but unfortunately no credit being given to this intelligence, or∣ders were not sent to collect the militia in sufficient time, which in conjunction with his own forces, and with those in the fort, had either obliged the French to relinquish their attempt, or to have made it a very great hazard. But the siege being now regularly formed, and the besiegers meeting but lit∣tle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 3.</NOTE> opposition from within, and no disturbance at all from with∣out, the place was in six <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> days surrendered by the advice of General Webb; whose intercepted letter M. Montcalm sent into the fort.</P>
<P>The garrison marched out with their arms, and engaged not to serve during eighteen months. The French savages paid no regard to the capi∣tulation, but falling upon our men as they marched out, dragged away the little effects they had left, hawl∣ing the Indians and Blacks in our service out of their ranks, scalping some, carrying off others, and com∣mitting a thousand outrages and barbarities, from which the French commander endeavoured in vain to restrain them. All this was suffered by 2000 men with arms in their hands, from a disorderly crew of savages. However the greatest part of our men, though in a bad condition, got to Fort Edward, some by flight; some having surrendered themselves to the French, were by them sent home safe. The enemy demolished the fort, carried off the provision, ammunition, artillery, and the vessels which we had prepared on the lake, and departed with∣out attempting any thing further. Neither was any thing further at∣tempted on our side. And thus was finished the third campaign in North-America, where we had actually near 20,000 regular troops, a great number of provincial forces, and a great naval power of upwards of twenty ships of the line.</P>
<P>A war between the maritime powers is felt in all parts of the world. Not content with inflam∣ing Europe and America, the dissen∣tions of the French and English pursued the tracks of their com∣merce, and the Ganges felt the fa∣tal effects of a quarrel on the Ohio. But here the scene is changed great∣ly to the advantage of our nation; the bravery of Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, re-established the military honour of the English, which was sinking there as it had done in all other places. Admiral Watson
<PB N="31" REF="43"/>
with no more than three ships of the line, sailed from Madrass, and after a tedious voyage arrived at the port of Balasore in the kingdom of Bengal, where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5.</NOTE> strengthening his force with what recruits he could draw together, he entered the Ganges, and after a short resistance made himself master of Busbudgia fort which com∣manded that part of the ri∣ver. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 30.</NOTE> This opened him a passage to the fort of Calcutta, the late principal settlement of the company in Bengal, and the scene of the de∣plorable sufferings of so many of our unfortunate countrymen. Ani∣mated with revenge at the affecting sight of this place, our ships and land forces attacked it with so much spirit, that the Indians surrendered it on the same day it was approach∣ed. A few days after Hugly, situ∣ated higher up on the Ganges, was reduced with as little difficulty.</P>
<P>The Nabob, who saw that the tor∣rent of the English valour could not be resisted by such feeble dams as forts defended by Indians, drew down a whole army consisting of 10,000 horse, and 12,000 foot, to drive them from their conquests. In∣finitely inferior as our troops were in number, they did not he∣sitate to attack the Nabob's <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5.</NOTE> army. Though our forces did not entirely rout the Indians, yet they made a great slaughter amongst them; and they had so much the advantage of the field, that the Nabob was in a short time <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> glad to conclude a treaty of peace, by which the English East-India company was re-established in all its antient privileges; an immunity from all taxes was granted, and a restitution promised for all that the trade had suffered in the taking of Calcutta.</P>
<P>When all obstruction on the side of the Indians was removed, and the company's officers had taken possession of their antient establish∣ments, the Admiral turned his arms against the French. He resolved to attack Chandenagore, situated some∣what higher on the river than Cal∣cutta; a place of considerable strength and the principal settlement of the French in that part of the East-Indies. In this expedition Colonel Clive commanded 700 Europeans and 1600 Black soldiers. The Admirals Watson and Pocock commanded the fleet, if it may be called a fleet which consisted of no more than three ships of the line, the Kent, the Tyger, and the Salis∣bury. The French prepared in the best manner they could to receive them, and sunk several large vessels both above and below their fort; but the Admiral having by carefully sounding found a safe passage with∣out being driven to the necessity of weighing up any of the ships, made so severe a fire upon the fort, in which he was seconded by Colonel Clive's batteries on the shore, that the place capitulated in <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 24.</NOTE> less than three hours. 500 Europe∣ans and 700 Blacks surrendered pri∣soners of war; 183 pieces of cannon were found in the place, besides a considerable value in goods and money. Four forts cost our troops no more than four days to reduce them.</P>
<P>The judicious timeing of these several operations, as well as those which followed, was not less laud∣able than the gallant spirit with which they were executed. Before the French were alarmed, care was taken to repossess all the posts we formerly held; to humble the Na∣bob by some effectual blow; and by a treaty to tie up his hands from act∣ing
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
against us. This Prince had shewed himself from the moment of his signing that treaty, very little inclined to abide by the stipulations he had made. He indeed promised abundantly, but always deferred the performance upon such frivolous pretences, as evidently demonstrated his ill intentions. The English commanders understood this pro∣ceeding perfectly well; but they resolved to dissemble their sense of it, until they had broken the French power in this province, which they had greater reason to dread, small as it was, than all the armies of the Nabob. When they had fully accomplished this by the taking of Chandenagore, they deli∣berated whether they ought not to recommence hostilities with the In∣dians. A resolution in the affirma∣tive had been attended with great difficulty and danger, if a most for∣tunate incident had not helped to en∣sure success.</P>
<P>The Nabob Suraja Doula, the same who had the last year taken Calcutta, had shewn to his own sub∣jects the same violent and perfidious spirit, which formerly and still distres∣sed the English. His Generals were mostly discontented, and some of them entered into a conspiracy against him. Jaffier Ali Cawn one of his principal officers, a man of great power and interest, was at the head of this conspiracy. As soon as their designs were ripened, they communicated them to the English government in Calcutta, praying their assistance. The chiefs there did not hesitate long what party they should take; they entered into a treaty with Jaffier Ali Cawn and the conspirators; and in consequence of this treaty, our troops immediately took the field under Colonel Clive. The Ad∣miral undertook to garrison the fort of Chandenagore with his seamen, in order to leave the greater number of land forces for the expedition. A detachment of fifty seamen with their officers were added to serve as gunners. A twenty gun ship was stationed above Hugly, in order to preserve a com∣munication between Colonel Clive and the Admiral.</P>
<P>Their preliminary measures being thus judiciously taken, they advanced up the river, and in a few days brought the Nabob's army of about 20,000 men, exclusive of those who favoured the conspirators, to an ac∣tion, which was decisive in favour of the English. Two <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22.</NOTE> considerable bodies commanded by Jaffier and Roy Dolub remained inactive in the engagement. The Nabob seeing himself ruined by the treachery of his officers and the cowardice of his troops, fled with the few who continued faithful to him.</P>
<P>Jaffier Ali Cawn now de∣clared himself openly; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> entering Muxadavat the capital of the province with an army of his friends and victorious allies, he was placed by Colonel Clive in the antient seat of the Nabobs, and received the homage of all ranks of people as Suba of Bengal, Bahar and Orixa. The deposed Nabob was soon after made prisoner, and put to death in his prison by the conqueror. In about thirteen days this great revolution was accomplished; and with less force and trouble than often is required to take a petty village in Germany, was transferred the government of a vast kingdom, yielding in its di∣mensions to few in Europe, but to none in the fertility of its soil, the number of its inhabitants, and the richness of its commerce. By the alliance with the new Nabob, and by the reduction of Chandenagore, the French were entirely driven out
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
of Bengal and all its dependencies. This was one of the articles of the treaty. By the other articles, a perpetual alliance offensive and de∣fensive was made between the par∣ties. The territories of the com∣pany were enlarged, and upwards of two millions sterling was stipu∣lated to be paid as an indemnifica∣tion to the East-India company, and the sufferers in the taking of Cal∣cutta. The new Nabob full of gratitude to those to whom he owed his dignity, gave, besides the above large sums, about 600, 000 pounds, as a gratuity to the sea squadron and the troops. However short of ex∣pectation our enterprises in America fell this year, those in the East-In∣dies greatly exceeded every thing we could hope from the forces which were employed. And it may be doubted whether all the great powers engaged in the present bloody wars in Europe, in which such torrents of blood are spilled, and so many millions of treasure are wasted, will in the conclusion reap amongst them so much solid profit as the English East-India company did with a handful of men in a short campaign. The joy of the nation at these signal successes, was not a little damped by the death of Admiral Watson, who lost his life by the unwhole∣someness <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16.</NOTE> of the country, in which he had established a great and last∣ing reputation. Colonel Clive still lives to enjoy the fortune and ho∣nour he has acquired by his gallant actions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>French retire out of Hanover. The taking of Hoya. Minden taken. Distress of the French. Generosity of the Duke de Randan. The French retire beyond the Rhine. Recovery of Embden by Commodore Holmes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the bloodshed of the last campaign in <NOTE PLACE="marg">1758.</NOTE> Germany, and those losses which both the victorious and vanquished felt so very severely, produced no overtures towards peace from any of the powers at war. And perhaps nothing so singular ever happened, as that so many states, united, if not against their real interests, yet a∣gainst all their former habits of con∣nection, full of so many occasions of jealousy, abounding with matter of complaint against each other, and even involved in misfortunes which usually destroy a mutual confidence, that not one of these powers either from fear, or hope, or weariness, or levity, desisted from their hostilities against the King of Prussia; nor did that monarch acquire one ally more by the admiration of his successes, than he had formerly gained thro' compassion to his misfortunes. All the confederates preserved the same attachment to each other, to him the same animosity. It is equally a mat∣ter of great admiration, how the resources even of these great states, could keep pace with their ambition, and in a very few months supply the place of great armies almost wholly destroyed. The King of Prussia by his victories had added to his natu∣ral resources. These resources were more considerable than is commonly imagined; and the possession of Saxony which yielded him great supplies, saved his own revenue. He was indeed not quite so fresh as at the beginning of the war; but then the condition of the enemy was
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
in many respects far worse that his. His troops had besides acquired a high reputation and a clear supe∣riority over all others. The con∣sideration, however, of an army greatly harassed, and a most severe winter obliged him to restrain his ardor, and to attempt nothing a∣gainst the Austrians in the months of January, February, and March. The same inaction owing to much the same causes, prevailed amongst the Hanoverians for a little time: but having been reinforced about the middle of February by a body of Prussian horse, they put their whole army once more in motion.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu had been recalled, and the Count of Clermont now commanded the French troops. This was their third commander in chief within the space of a year; a circumstance alone sufficient to shew the unsteadiness of their councils, and the irregularity of their o∣perations. In effect, they every where retreated before the Hanove∣rians, whose main body marched on the right to the country of Bremen; whilst a second body under General Zastrow kept on the left towards Gif∣forn. They pushed the French from post to post. They obliged them to evacuate Ottersberg, Bremen, and Werden. The castle of Rotters∣berg was taken in six hours. A con∣siderable detachment under Count Chabot was posted at Hoya, a strong fort upon the Weser, and a place of such consequence that Prince Ferdinand resolved to dislodge the enemy from it. He appointed for that service the hereditary Prince of Brunswick, with four battalions of foot and some light horse. This Prince, not twenty years of age, had already entered into the course of glory under the auspices of his uncle, and full of ardor to signalize himself, with joy embraced the occasion: and here he gave an earnest of his fame, in one of the most lively and best conducted actions in the war. The first fruits of this young hero were such as would have done honour to the maturity of the most expe∣rienced soldiers.</P>
<P>The Prince had a broad and deep river to pass. He had no means of transporting his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23.</NOTE> men, but a single float; so that a long time must be spent in getting them over: what was worst, be∣fore half his troops were passed, a strong wind arose, which rendered the float unserviceable, and entire∣ly cut off all communication be∣tween the Prince and the most considerable number of his party, whilst the party he was going to attack was superior to him, had his whole body been together. In this exigence the Prince came to a resolution worthy of himself. He resolved not to spend any time in attempts to bring over the rest of his troops, much less to make any attempt to return to them; but to urge on boldly, in such a manner as to possess the enemy with an opinion of his strength, and to at∣tack them briskly before they could be undeceived. Therefore, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, they marched with the utmost speed di∣rectly to the Town of Hoya. When they were approached within a mile and an half of the place, another accident was on the point of de∣feating the whole enterprise. Their detachment fired by mistake upon four of the enemies dragoons, who were patrolling; the firing was caught from one to another, and at last became general. This seemed more than enough to discover their motions and alarm the enemy. But the same spirit influenced the con∣duct
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
of every part of this affair; a bold countenance became necessary, and it was assumed; they marched with the utmost diligence to the town, and encountered the enemy at the bridge; a fierce fire, well supported on either side, ensued. The ground was such, that the Prince could not bring up his whole detachment equally. Sensible of this disadvantage, he formed a design to overcome it, as judicious as it was re∣solute, which was to turn the enemy by attacking them in the rear; to ex∣ecute this design, it was necessary to make a circuit about the twon. Eve∣ry thing succeeded: the attack on the enemy's rear was made with bayonets fixed; a terrible slaughter ensued. The French abandoned the bridge, and fled in confusion: The Prince having cleared the town of the ene∣my, joined the party he had left. The Count de Chabot threw him∣self, with two battalions, into the castle, with a resolution to maintain himself there; but, in a little time, he capitulated, surrendering the place, his stores, and magazines, his troops being permitted to march out. The Prince, who had no artillery, and who, on account of the bad∣ness of the roads, despaired of bring∣ing up heavy cannon, suffered them to depart. Six hundred and seven∣ty men were made prisoners in the action, and a place of much impor∣tance, and which opened a passage over the Weser, secured to the Ha∣noverians, with the loss of less than 100 men killed and wounded. I have dwelt on this action, and described it as particularly as I could, though nothing decisive in itself, because it is not in pitched battles between great armies, where the most mosterly strokes of conduct are always dis∣played; these lesser affairs frequent∣ly call for as much or more of saga∣city, resolution, and presence of mind, in the commander; yet are they often slightly passed by, as mat∣ters of no consequence, by the ge∣nerality of people, who rather con∣sider the greatness of the event, than the spirit of the action.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand continued to advance, with his right on one side of the Weser, and his left on the other; the French continued to re∣tire, and successively abandoned all the places they had occupied in the electorate, except Minden. A gar∣rison of 4000 men defended that place; but it was closely invested, and in nine days the whole garrison surrendered priso∣ners <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 14.</NOTE> of war. Several skir∣mishes happened between the ad∣vanced parties of the Hanoverian army and the French, always to the advantage of the former. The wretched condition of the French troops is hardly to be described or imagined: officers and soldiers in∣volved in one common distress; the officers forgot their rank, and the soldiers their obedience; full hospitals, and empty magazines; a rigorous season, and bad covering; their baggage seized or abandoned, and the hussars and hunters of the allied army continually harassing, pillaging, and cutting them off. It was no alleviation to their mise∣ry, that the inhabitants of the country, which they abandoned, were reduced to the same extremi∣ties. The savage behaviour of some of their corps at their depar∣ture, took away all compassion for their sufferings: but this was not universal. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in Hanover, quit∣ted the place with the same virtue, that he had so long held it. Re∣sentment had no more power to persuade him to act with rigour, in
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
the adverse turn of the French af∣fairs, than the pride of conquest had in their prosperity. When he had orders to evacuate the place, there were very considerable magazines of corn and forage, amassed for the use of the army; he had full time to burn them, and he had prece∣dents enough to have justified the action; but he left the whole in the hands of the magistrates, to be gra∣tuitously distributed to the poor: he employed all his vigilance to prevent the least disorder amongst his troops, and was himself the last man that marched out of the town. This be∣haviour, which did such honour to his name and country, has made his memory for ever dear to the Hano∣verians, drew tears of love and gra∣titude from his enemies, and acknow∣ledgements from the generous Prince against whom he served.</P>
<P>The French, through extreme dif∣ficulties, marched towards the Rhine in three columns. The several scat∣tered bodies, which had united at Munster, formed the right. The body which came from Paderborn, and which was commanded by the Prince of Clermont in person, march∣ed in the middle. The forces which had occupied Hesse were on the left. In this order they reached the Rhine, which they all passed, except a body under Count Clermont, who still re∣mained at Wesel, and resolved to maintain that post. The French army, which about four months before had passed the Rhine in numbers, and in a condition to make the most power∣ful enemies tremble, without any ad∣verse stroke of war whatsoever, by a fate almost unparalleled, now re∣passed it like fugitives, in a condition the most deplorable, reduced to less than half their original number, and closely pursued by the enemy, which they had obliged to lay down their arms.</P>
<P>The same ill fortune, and the same despair of their affairs, followed them every where. On the arrival of a small English squadron, commanded by Commodore Holmes, before Emb∣den, and their taking an ad∣vantageous situation, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 18.</NOTE> cut off the communication between the town and the mouth of the river Ems; the French garrison, consisting of 4000 <NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> men, immediately evacuated the place. As soon as Mr. Holmes dis∣covered their design, and that they were transporting their artillery and baggage up the river, he ordered out a few armed boats to pursue them. These took some of the enemy's ves∣sels, in which were the son of an of∣ficer of distinction, and a considerable sum of money. The Commodore without delay restored the son to his father, and offered to return the mo∣ney, on receiving the officer's word of honour, that it was his private property. This affair is mentioned, not only to do justice to the judicious conduct by which a place of so much consideration was so easily carried, but also to that generosity of spirit, which so nobly distinguishes almost all those, who hold any rank in our service.</P>

<P>WHILST the French arms suffered such disgraces a∣broad, they endeavoured by an al∣teration of their councils at home, to restore their credit. Their ministers had been long the sport of female ca∣price; it was their power of pleasing a mistress who governed their King, that alone qualified them to serve their country. Some of the most able men were turned out of their employ∣ments with disgrace; others retir∣ed from the publick service with indignation; a certain low cha∣racter had for a long time appeared in all the proceedings of France, both within and without. Even in their domestic disputes, and where something of a free and manly spirit appeared, this spirit evapo∣rated, and spent itself upon un∣worthy and despicable objects. These contests which involved the church, the law, and the crown, weakened them all; and the state felt all the ill effects of disunion of its orders, without seeing an augmentation of power thrown in∣to the scale of any. But now taught by their misfortunes and disgraces, they were obliged to an alteration in their conduct: they were obliged to call men to the public service upon public prin∣ciples; at a time indeed, when in many respects things could only be altered not mended; and wise and able ministers could do little more by their penetration and public spirit, than to see and lament the ruin, caused by the want of those virtues in their predecessors. The Duke de Belleisle, known to all Europe for his great abilities, and his great exploits, was at length placed at the head of the military department, as Secretary at war.</P>
<P>There appeared in the common prints a speech, said to be made by that nobleman in council; which, if it be not authentic, contains at least such sentiments, as would come not unnaturally from a French patriot, and one who had served his King and country with honour during better times.</P>
<P><Q>“I know, said he, the state of our armies. It gives me great grief, and no less indignation: for besides the real evil of the disorder in itself, the disgrace and infamy which it reflects on our government, and on the whole nation, is still more to be apprehended. The choice of of∣ficers ought to be made with ma∣ture deliberation. I know but too well to what length the want of discipline, pillaging and robbing have been carried on by the officers and common men, after the example set them by their generals. It mortifies me to think I am a Frenchman; my principles are known to be very different from those which are now followed. I had the satisfaction to retain the esteem, the friendship and the conside∣ration, of all the princes, noble∣men,
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>
and even all the com∣mon people in all parts of Ger∣many where I command the King's forces. They lived there in the midst of abundance; eve∣ry one was pleased; it fills my soul with anguish, to find that at present the French are held in execration; that every body is dispirited and that many offi∣cers publicly say things that are criminal and highly punishable. The evil is so great that it de∣mands immediate redress. I can easily judge, by what passes in my own breast, of what our ge∣nerals feel from the speeches they must daily hear in Ger∣many, concerning our conduct; which indeed would lose much to be compared with that of our allies. I must particularly com∣plain of the delays and irregu∣larity of the posts; a service which is very ill provided for. I am likewise displeased with the negligence of our generals in returning answers; which is a manifest breach of their duty. Had I commanded the army, a thousand things which are done, would not have been done; and others, which are neglected, would have been executed. I would have multiplied my com∣munications; I would have had strong posts on the right, on the left, and in the center, lined with troops. I would have had ma∣gazines in every place. The quiet and satisfaction of the country should have been equal to their present dissaffection, at being harassed and plundered; and we should have been as much beloved, as we are at present abhored. The conse∣quences are too apparent to need being mentioned. I must insist on these things, because late re∣dress is better than the continua∣tion of the evil.”</Q></P>
<P>M. de Belleisle being established in his office, turned all his attenti∣on to the cure of the evils, which he lamented; and exerted all the power that remained in the nation, to put their army in Germany once more upon a respectable footing. The expedition into Germany was originally a measure as contrary to the true interests of France, as it was justice and equity; but having adopted that measure, the consequences which arose seemed to demand that it should be pur∣sued with vigour. Therefore the connection with the Empress Queen was drawn closer than ever, and nothing was omitted to give a greater strength, and a better or∣der to the army on the Rhine. But these endeavours which strain∣ed all the sinews of France, already too much weakened by the almost total ruin of several essential bran∣ches of their trade, drew away all the recources necessary to support their navy. It was then in a suf∣ficiently bad condition, from a want of seamen and stores; and there were no means found, or little attention used, to restore it: so that from a deficiency in the ma∣rine, it seemed to be equally im∣practicable to feed the war in A∣merica, or to preserve the coast of France itself from insults. Such was the condition of our enemies, at the opening of the campaign of 1758.</P>
<P>As to England, far from being exhausted by the war, or dispirited by our ill success, our hopes rose from our disappointments, and our resources seemed to be augmented by our expences; with such ease and alacrity were the necessary sup∣granted
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
and raised. Many errors and many abuses which the war discovered without making fatal, were corrected. The spirit of our officers was revived by fear or by shame. Our trade was well pro∣tected by the superiority, and pru∣dent distribution of our naval force. The revenue was frugally manag∣ed, and the whole state well ce∣mented and bound together in all its parts, by the union of the admi∣nistration, by the patriotism which animated it, and by the entire confidence which the people had in the presiding abilities and inten∣tions. As France persisted in her attachment to the enemies of his Prussian majesty, Great Britain en∣tered into still closer engagements with that monarch, the lustre of whose virtues, set off by his late wonderful successes, quite turned our eyes from the objections which were raised against the consistency of that alliance with our interests. How far it is consistent with them, is, I think, a much more difficult point to settle, than the adherents to either party seem willing to allow. But it ought to be con∣sidered, that the circumstances of affairs in the beginning of the war, hardly admitted of any other choice; it had been the height of madness to have been on ill terms with his Prussian majesty at that time; and it was impossible to have kept good terms with him, without being on very bad ones with Vienna. Things were in an ill situation; and the ballance of Germany was in dan∣ger of being overset, what party soever should prevail. It was im∣possible that England could have stood neuter in this contest: if she had, France would not have imi∣tated her moderation; she would gladly have joined with the King of Prussia to distress Hanover, and reduce Austria. These two powers so exerted, would doubtless com∣pass their end, unless we interposed to prevent it; and we must sooner or latter have interposed, unless we were resolved tamely to see France and her allies giving laws to the continent. In a word, France would certainly have joined with one par∣ty or the other, and the party which she joined, would certainly, by that union, prove dangerous to the com∣mon liberty, and must therefore be opposed by us; we must have been in spite of us engaged in the troubles of Germany, as we ever have been, and ever shall be, as long as we are a people of consideration in Europe. The al∣liance with Prussia was pointed out to us by the circumstance of his acting on the defensive. The King of Prussia meditated no con∣quests. But her Imperial majesty indisputably aimed at the recovery of Silesia, which was to disturb the settled order of things; and this design was the only cause of the troubles in that part of the world. I am sensible that this is notwith∣standing all that may be said, a question of some intricacy, and re∣quires a consideration of many more particulars, than the brevity of our design will allow. But whether we chose our party in this al∣liance judiciously or not, we have, I imagine, very great reason to be pleased with a measure, which has induced France to engage so deep∣ly in the affairs of Germany, at so ruinous an expence of her blood and treasure. Our ministry was at this time fully convinced of the prudence of the choice that had been made, and resolved to sup∣port his Prussian majesty, and the army under Prince Ferdinand, in the
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
most effectual manner; 100,000 l. was voted for the Hanoverian and Hessian forces; and a convention between the King of Prussia, and his Britannic majesty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 11.</NOTE> was signed at London, whereby the King of Great Britain engages to pay his Prussian majesty the sum of 670,000 pounds sterling; and each of the contracting powers en∣gage to conclude no peace with∣out the participation of the other.</P>
<P>The northern courts made no alteration in their system. In Swe∣den, some real plots to disturb the established constitution ended in the ruin of their contrivers; some ficti∣tious plots were set on foot to give a sanction to measures against the crown party, which answered their ends; and, as the ruling power continued the same, and the inter∣nal dissensions the same, the hosti∣lities against the King of Prussia were resolved with the former ani∣mosity, but promised to be pursued with the former languor. In Rus∣sia, the Empress did not think her intentions well seconded by her ministers. The great delays, and the unaccountable retreat in the last campaign, gave ground to sus∣pect, that she had been betrayed by her ministers, or her generals. M. Apraxin was removed from the command, and was put under arrest. He justified his conduct by express orders from Count Bestuchef. Bes∣tuchef was removed from his office, and put under arrest also. Count Woronzoff suceeded Bestuchef in his employment, and the Generals Brown and Fermor took the com∣mand of the army in the place of Apraxin.</P>
<P>As soon as the season permitted the King of Prussia to re∣commence his operations, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 3.</NOTE> he laid siege to Schweidnitz, and pushed it with so much vigour, that the place surrendered in thirteen days. The garri∣son <NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> reduced by sickness during the blockade, and by their losses during the siege, from seven to little more than three thousand men, yielded themselves prisoners of war. By this stroke, the King of Prussia left his enemies no footing in any part of his dominions. His next consi∣deration was how to guard against their future attempts, and at the same time to make a vigorous at∣tack upon some part of the Austrian territories. His forces were well stationed for both these purposes; for besides the troops which Count Dohna commanded on the side of Pomerania, a considerable body was posted between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Silesia from the fury of the Russians, in case they should make their inroad that way. An army, in a little time after was formed in Saxony, com∣manded by his brother Prince Henry, which consisted of thirty battalions, and forty-five squadrons. It was destined to make head against the army of the Empire, which by amazing efforts made during the winter, and by the junction of a large body of Austrians, was now in a condition to act again. A ready communication was kept up between all the King of Prussia's armies, by a proper choice of posts.</P>
<P>The King resolved to make Mo∣ravia the theatre of the war this year. Moravia was fresh ground; a country as yet untouched by the ravages of war. If he should suc∣ceed in his operations in this coun∣try, his successes by opening to him the nearest road to Vienna, must prove more decisive than they could any where else. If he should
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
fail, the Austrians were at a dis∣tance from the center of his affairs, and would find it difficult to im∣prove their advantages to his ruin. After the reduction of Schweidnitz, the King ordered two bodies of his troops to post themselves in such a manner, as to make it appear that he intended to carry the war into Bohemia. Whilst he drew away the enemies attention from the real objects by these dispositions, the main of his army, by a very rapid march, entered <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 3.</NOTE> into Moravia in two columns, and made themselves masters, in a short time and with little or no opposi∣tion, of all the posts necessary to cover the troops to be employed in the siege of Olmutz. On the 27th of May the trenches were opened before that city.</P>
<P>M. Daun was no sooner apprised of the King's march towards Mo∣ravia, than he took his route through Bohemia to that province. Notwithstanding that the Empress Queen omitted no possible endea∣vours to assemble a just army a∣gainst the King of Prussia, though she had for that purpose exhausted the Milanese and Tuscany, and swept up the last recruits in her Danubian territories, M. Daun was not yet in a condition to give the King of Prussia battle; neither did his character lead him to trust that to fortune, which he might ensure, though more slowly, by conduct. This wise General took his posts from Gewics to Lit∣tau, in a mountainous country, in a situation where it was impossible to attack him. He had the fertile country of Bohemia, from whence he readily and certainly drew sup∣plies, at his rear. He was from his position at the same time enabled to harass the Prussian army before Olmutz, and to intercept the con∣voys which were brought to them from Silesia.</P>
<P>Olmutz, by the extent of its works, and other advantageous circumstances, is a city which it is very difficult compleatly to invest. So that some of the King's posts being necessarily weakened by oc∣cupying so great an extent of country, were attacked by Daun's detachments from time to time, with such success, that abundant suc∣cours both of men and ammunition were thrown into the place. These attacks were always made by night, and very few nights passed with∣out some attack. The success was various. But the operations of the siege were greatly disturbed by these continual alarms. Besides it is said that the Austrians, before the King's invasion of this province, had de∣stroyed all the forage in the neigh∣bourhood of Olmutz. The horse were obliged to forage at a great distance, which harassed them ex∣treamly. M. Daun took advan∣tage of all these circumstances. It was in vain that the King of Prus∣sia endeavoured by all the arts of a great commander to provoke or entice him to an engagement. He profited of the advantages he had made, without being tempted by them to throw out of his hands the secure game he was playing.</P>
<P>The great object of M. Daun was the Prussian convoys. On re∣ceiving advice that a large and impor∣tant one was to leave Troppau on the 25th of June, he took measures to intercept it. He ordered Gene∣ral Jahnus, who was at Muglitz on the left, to advance towards Bahrn, and a detachment which was at Prerau at a considerable distance to the right, to march to Stadt-Leibe; so that these two corps should on
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>
different sides attack the convoy at one and the same time. To further the execution of this project M. Daun himself approached the Prus∣sian army, and directed all his mo∣tions as if he intended to give them battle. However, the King was too great a master in the game of gene∣ralship, which was now playing, to be deceived by this feint. He de∣tached a considerable party under General Ziethen, to support his con∣voy, which was already about 7000 strong. Before this detachment could come up, the convoy was attacked, but the Austrians were repulsed. But M. Daun, who provided for every thing, quickly reinforced his parties who renewed the engagement the next day. They first suffered the head of the convoy to go unmo∣lested; but as the center was still em∣barrassed in a dangerous defile, they easily cut off the head from the rest, and then they attacked the center with the greatest fury. The Prussians made as good a resistance as the na∣ture of the ground would suffer. Ge∣neral Ziethen did every thing which could be expected from an accom∣plished officer; but in the end they were entirely routed; all the wag∣gons in that division were taken; the rear was pushed back towards Trop∣pau; the head alone with great diffi∣culty arrived at the Prussian camp.</P>
<P>This was a fatal stroke, because it came at a time when it was im∣possible to repair it. The siege of Olmutz had been all along attended with great difficulties; and now the news which every day arrived of the nearer and nearer approach of the Russians, called the King loudly to the defence of his own dominions. Already the Cossacks and Calmucks made incursions into Silesia, and by their ravages and cruelties, an∣nounced the approach of the great army. The siege must be raised; Moravia must be abandoned; Mar∣shal Daun must have the honour of freeing his country, and driving a∣way such an adversary as the King of Prussia, from a conquest deemed certain; all was performed without a battle, by a series of the most refined and vigorous manoeuvres that ever were put in practice.</P>
<P>When the King of Prussia saw that the unprosperous situation of his affairs obliged him to retreat; he took a Resolution, such as a vic∣tory inspires in others. He took advantage even of the excellent movement of M. Daun, by which that able general had advanced his quarters to Poznitz, and placed himself so as to support Olmutz in the most effectual manner; by this movement, however, he was obliged to uncover the frontiers of Bohemia. The King of Prus∣sia, whom nothing could escape, was sensible of this advantage, and therefore, instead of falling back upon Silesia, which step would im∣mediately have drawn the Austrian army into his dominions, he deter∣mined to retreat from one part of the enemies territories into another. The day before the siege was raised the firing of the Prussians continued as brisk as ever, and shewed no sort of sign of an intention to depart; but in the night the whole army took the road to Bo∣hemia <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> in two columns, and gained an entire march upon the Austrians. So that notwithstanding the utmost efforts which the enemy could make to overtake and harass the King upon his march, he advanced into Bohemia with little molestation, seized upon a large magazine at Leutomissel, defeated some corps of Austrians who had attempted to disturb him in his progress, and
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
arrived at Konigsgratz, one of the most important posts in Bohemia, with all his sick and wounded, with all his heavy baggage, all his heavy artillery, and military stores compleat. This place he possessed after driving from it a body of 7000 Austrians who were entrenched there. He immedi∣ately laid this city and several other districts under contribution; but his plan not admitting any further ope∣rations on that side, he took no o∣ther advantage from this momentous post. He soon re-entered Silesia, and marched with the most amazing diligence to encounter the Russians, who had at this time united their di∣vided corps under Brown and Fer∣mor, and fixed the long fluctuating plan of their operations, by entering the New Marche of Brandenburgh and laying siege to Custrin. The reduction of this place could leave them but a few days march to Ber∣lin; Count Dohna was not in a condition to oppose their progress, the King was still at a great distance. But it is necessary to break our narrative of his affairs, however interesting, to take a view of the operations of the armies on the Rhine. We leave the King of Prus∣sia in full march, to give one body of his enemies battle, after execut∣ing a retreat from the other, in a manner that did his military genius the greatest honour. So that on the whole, it is difficult to say, which gained the greatest glory, the King of Prussia by his retreat, or M. Daun by the measures which obliged him to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Allies pass the Rhine. Battle of Crevelt. Action at Sangershausen. Action at Meer. Allies repass the Rhine.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PRINCE Ferdinand had it not in his power to cut off the re∣treat of the French over the Rhine; but he pressed them closely, and prepared himself to cross that river in pursuit of them. His design was to carry the war beyond the Maese, and thereby oblige the Prince de Soubise to abandon the enterprise he was preparing against Hesse Cassel. His Highness executed the passage of the Rhine at Herven with the corps immediately <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1.</NOTE> under his command; then he sent the bridge with which he served him∣self so well up the river to Rees; the rest of the troops passed there; the whole army were over before the 7th of June. The flattery of the last age saw with astonishment a passage of the Rhine by a French monarch, unopposed, at the head of a mighty army. We saw that river passed by the enemies of France, in the presence of an army of 50,000 of that nation; it was an action which did not need the exagge∣rations of rhetoric.</P>
<P>The French army retired as the Prince advanced, and took an ad∣vantageous camp which threatened to retard the operations of the allies. Their right was under Rheinberg; but the Prince by his well judged motions turned their left flank to∣wards the convent of Campe, by which the French found themselves obliged to quit their advantageous post, and to retire into Meurs. They still kept towards the Rhine. The Prince advanced on the side of the Maese.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="56"/>
It was evident, that whilst the French continued only to retire, it would prove impossible for them to hinder the allies from executing the plan they proposed. They therefore thought it adviseable to change their countenance. They had fallen back as far as Nuys; they now returned on their steps, and advan∣ced as far as Crevelt, within a few miles of Prince Ferdinand's camp. The Prince made the dispositions for a battle, with his usual vigour and prudence. He carefully recon∣noitred the situation of the enemy. He found that their right was at a village called Vischelon; their left extended towards Anrath, where it was covered with a wood: Crevelt, which was in the front of their right, was occupied by a party of their troops. His Highness resolved upon three attacks. The first and real attack was on the flank of the enemies left wing; the other two were designed to divert their atten∣tion, and prevent their succouring the object of his principal attack; for which purpose he recommended to his generals to make the best use of their heavy artillery, and not to advance too far unless they were per∣fectly assured of the success of the main operation.</P>
<P>Having made these wise disposi∣tions, and perfectly learned the best routes by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 23.</NOTE> the enemy might be approached, his Highness put himself at the head of the grenadiers of his right wing, and advanced on the side of Anrath in two columns. A cannonading violent and well supported opened the ac∣tion. The Hanoverian artillery was greatly superior to that of the French; but though the French lost many men, they lost no ground in this way, and their position in the wood made a close attack absolutely neces∣sary. The hereditary Prince of Brunswick put himself at the head of the first line of foot, and with his usual spirit, advanced with the whole front directly to the wood. Here a furious fire of small arms commenced, which continued with∣out the smallest intermission for two hours and an half. All the Ha∣noverian battalions threw themselves into the wood. Two ditches well lined with infantry were opposed to their fury. They were forced one after another. The enemies batta∣lions were pushed back, they were entirely broken, and fled out of the wood in a disorder which was irre∣parable. Their cavalry, who kept the best countenance possible, in spite of the terrible fire of the Hanoverian artillery, and in spite of the vigo∣rous attempts of the Hanoverian horse, who had by this time found means to gain the plain, covered the retreat of their scattered infantry, and saved them from utter ruin. The right wing and the center, though they suffered grievously by the can∣nonading, were no where broken, but retreated towards Nuys in the most perfect order.</P>
<P>Seven thousand of their best troops were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners; but there was nothing in this battle so grievous to France, and so affecting even to the enemy, as the fate of the Count de Gisors. This young nobleman, the only son of the Duke de Belleisle, not above twenty-five years of age, newly married to the heiress of an illustrious house; himself the last hope of a most noble family, was mortally wounded at the head of his regiment, which he brought up with the most heroic courage, and inspired by his example to make
<PB N="45" REF="57"/>
incredible efforts. He had been educated with all the care an excel∣lent father could bestow on a son of an uncommon genius, who was alone able to support the reputation of his family. To the purest morals he had united the politest manners; he had made a great proficiency in learning; he knew many branches of it, and loved all; he had seen every part of Europe, and read courts and nations with a discerning eye; and wanting nothing to fulfil all hope, and to make him a perfect and lasting ornament and support to his country, but a knowledge in the military art; he entered that course of glory and danger, and fell in his first campaign. The unhappy father and minister saw his pri∣vate misfortunes keep pace with the public calamities, and the tears of his family mingled with those of his country.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand gained a victory at Crevelt, which did the great∣est honour to his military capa∣city and to the bravery of his troops. But it was a victory neither entire nor decisive. The French army on their own frontiers was quickly and strong∣ly reinforced: so that they were not only in a condition in some sort to make head against the allies, but were enabled to detach a considerable rein∣forcement to the army of the Prince de Soubise on the other side of the Rhine.</P>
<P>Although the Prince had reason to imagine that he should not be able to keep his ground on this side of the Rhine for any considerable time, this did not hinder him from improving to the utmost the ad∣vantage he had obtained. Whilst the French disabled by their late defeat, were in no condition to oppose him, he passed the Rhine with a large detachment, and ap∣peared on the 28th of June be∣fore Dusseldorp, a city advantage∣ously situated on the river, and belonging to the Elector Palatine. A severe bombardment obliged it to capitulate on the 7th of July. The garrison, consisting of 2000 men, marched out with the honours of war. Prince Ferdinand placed here three battalions of Hanove∣rians, and threw a bridge of boats across the river; by that means he multiplied his posts and com∣munications on both sides of the Rhine; and threw a new and no small impediment in the way of the French, to retard their progress, in case he should find himself compelled to retire. After this, the army of the allies and that of France, spent several days in mak∣ing various marches and counter∣marches, as if they both pro∣posed to bring on an action, to which however, it does not appear that either party was very strongly inclined.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand still retained his hopes that the Prince of Ysen∣burg, who commanded the Hessian troops, would find the Prince of Soubise employment for some time. He had originally laid his plan in such a manner, that by passing the Maese and transferring the seat of war into the enemies country, he might draw the French from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince of Soubise to come to the assistance of the main army under M. de Contades, who commanded in the room of Count Clermont, being now the fourth commander of the French troops since they en∣tered Germany. But whilst Prince Ferdinand pleased himself with those hopes, and still continued to act as far as circumstances would ad∣mit, in pursuance of this plan he
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>
received an account which discon∣certed all his measures.</P>
<P>The Duke de Broglio support∣ed by the corps of the Prince de Soubise, with a much superior force, attacked and defeated the Hessian army of seven <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> thousand men near Sangershausen. This opened to them the possession of the Weser. They might act in Westphalia, on which side so ever they pleased, and it was to be feared, that if they availed them∣selves of the advantages they had, they might be able to intercept the British troops. These troops having been landed at Embden, were now on their march under the command of the Duke of Marlborough to reinforce the al∣lied army. The Prince in this situation of affairs, had no option left but an engagement with the French army or a retreat over the Rhine. The former was not easy to compass, as the French industri∣ously declined a battle, and it be∣came extremely dangerous to re∣main long in a position with the enemies army on his left, and the strong fortress of Gueldre on his right. In this situation his subsistence became every day more difficult. To repass the Rhine, had its difficulties too; the roads which led to that ri∣ver were rendered almost impassable by the heavy rains; the river itself was so swelled with them, that the bridge at Rees had been for some time useless.</P>
<P>These disagreeable circumstances of the allied army did not escape the penetration of Monsieur de Chevert, one of the ablest com∣manders among the French. He formed a plan upon them, which if it had succeeded, must have put the allies into the greatest perplexity. This general had some time before passed the Rhine, with an intention of making himself master of Dusseldorp, and he had prepared all things with great ability for that enterprise. The rains unusually heavy for that season, and some other cross accidents, had frustrated his inten∣tions. But perceiving that the same accidents which defeated his design proved also unfavourable to the enemy, he resolved to turn his disappointment into an advan∣tage, and from the ruins of his first project to build another of yet greater importance. Baron Im∣hoff was posted to the right of the Rhine in a strong situation near Meer. He was to cover the bridge at Rees; to secure a considerable magazine; and to keep open com∣munication between the English reinforcements and the main army. The plan of Monsieur Chevert was to dislodge Imhoff, to burn the bridge at Rees, to make himself master of the magazine, and to ren∣der the junction of the English troops with the Hanoverians im∣practicable. To execute this judi∣cious scheme, he united several de∣tachments from the garrison of We∣sel, to a considerable corps which he intended to have employed in the siege of Dusseldorp. The whole made near 12,000 men. The troops under Imhoff were but six battalions; and four squadrons, hard∣ly 3000 in all.</P>
<P>When that general was ap∣prised of the designs and motions of the French, he saw it was in vain to expect succours from the army of Prince Ferdinand. The swell of the river had rendered all relief impossible; all his hopes were therefore in his own genius and the bravery of his troops. He considered that though the
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
post he occupied was sufficiently strong, the enemy might make themselves masters of Rees, by turning his camp, and thus exe∣cute one of the principal parts of their design; he considered the great difference between attacking and being attacked; he considered the effect of an attempt altogether unexpected by the enemy; he there∣fore took the resolution of abandon∣ing his post, and going out to meet them. Perceiving that the French were marching into diffi∣cult ground, he did not lose a mo∣ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 5.</NOTE> to begin the action. He ordered a small party, which he had posted in a little coppice, to fall upon the ene∣mies left, which he observed to be uncovered; and appointed the fire of this party, as a signal for all the rest to advance, and make the on∣set with bayonets fixed. The French thus vigorously and unex∣pectedly attacked, fell into confu∣sion; their courage ill seconded the wisdom of their general; they did not stand half an hour; they left on the field of battle, eleven pie∣ces of cannon, many prisoners, and much baggage to the Hanoverians, who drove them under the cannon of Wesel.</P>
<P>This signal advantage over such a prodigious superiority was not more gallantly obtained, than well pursued and improved. Imhoff saw that the rains had increased to such a degree, as to leave no hopes for the allied army to pass by the bridge at Rees. Having taken proper care of his magazines, he quitted his post at Meer, and being reinforced by some parties, who passed the river in boats, he march∣ed with the utmost diligence to∣wards the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oute of the English forces, and happily effected a junc∣tion, which had hitherto been at∣tended with so many difficulties.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand in his retreat met with no obstruction, but just what was sufficient to display more fully the gallantry of his officers, and the spirit of his troops. A town called Wachtendonck was on his left, as he retreated; this place, though not fortified, is a post of much importance, and being an island surrounded by the river Ni∣ers, is extremely difficult of access. The French had thrown a body of troops into this place. The here∣ditary Prince, the first in every ac∣tive service, was employed to force it. The bridge on his approach had been drawn up. The Prince seeing that if he attempted to get down this bridge, the enemy would gain time to recollect themselves, threw himself into the river; his grenadiers, animated by so gallant an example, plunged in after him, and furiously attacking the enemy with their bayonets, in a few mi∣nutes drove them from that post. This advantage, joined to that gained by General Imhoff, and the uncommon resolution which ap∣peared in both these actions, awed the French. They found that their troops, raw, undisciplined, and little fit for hard service, were not to be relied upon; and they feared to bring on an action, which by being decisive against them might draw on the most fatal consequences. So that the Prince repassed the Rhine in a most excellent order, even with less trouble than he had at first passed it; and indeed with little molestation, but what he met with from the weather. Such exces∣sive rains had fallen, that he in vain attempted a passage at Rhineberg
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
or at his bridge of Rees; he effected it a little lower <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. and 10.</NOTE> at a place called Griethuy∣sen.</P>
<P>Although Prince Ferdinand was obliged to pass the Rhine, and to act more upon the defensive for the future; yet his vigorous conduct in the beginning was very glorious to him, and very advantageous to the common cause. The French suf∣fered greatly in their military repu∣tation; the Hanoverians had gain∣ed a superiority over them, and now so much of the campaign was wasted, that notwithstanding the greatness of their numbers, it was not probable that they would find themselves able to make any consi∣derable progress in their designs against the King's electoral domi∣nions for this year. The advan∣tage gained by Broglio and Sou∣bise was not attended with the consequences, which might have been apprehended. Prince Ysen∣burg kept so good a countenance in a strong post he had chosen, that the French did not choose to at∣tack him again; and since Prince Ferdinand had repassed the Rhine, he might always be well sup∣ported.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Retreat from Bohemia. Measures of Count Daun. Battle of Custrin. King of Prussia marches into Saxony, and joins Prince Henry.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the retreat of the Prussians from Moravia, the war had assumed a new face. The generals who conducted it had changed hands. The King of Prussia was obliged to act upon the defensive; M. Daun was now in a condition of displaying his talents in an of∣fensive war. The affairs of the King of Prussia were scarce ever in a more critical situation than at that time. The Russians seemed at first disposed to enter into Si∣lesia; but now they had united their several disjointed corps, pene∣trated into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and having com∣menced the siege of Custrin, a place that threatened them with no great opposition, they were arrived within a few days march of Berlin. Count Dohna posted with a great∣ly inferior force at Frankfort on the Oder, watched without being able to obstruct their progress. In Po∣merania, the Generals Weedel and Manteufel opposed almost the same ineffectual efforts to the arms of Sweden. The army of the Empire, and a considerable body of Austri∣ans under General Haddick, ad∣vanced into Saxony, and possessing themselves by degrees of those strong posts, which compose the frontiers of Misnia, they continually streightened the quarters of Prince Henry. That Prince was strongly encamped at Dippolswalde, with about 20,000 men, in order to cover Dresden, and command the course of the Elbe. Thus circumstanced, the King could not find his account in remaining long in Bohemia, where it was impossible to effect any thing decisive. Every thing depended upon his being able to drive the Russians out of his territories, who with a mighty force ruined every place they arrived at, and seemed not only to make war against him, but against human nature itself.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="61"/>
M. Daun was soon apprised of the King of Prussia's intentions: but he considered that if he was to pur∣sue the King into Silesia, he must encounter with difficulties almost insuperable; several strong places stood in his way, and it would prove easy for the Prussian troops left for the defence of that dutchy, to take an advantageous camp un∣der one of those places, and thus oblige them to waste unprofitably the time, which might be employ∣ed in the execution of more judi∣cious projects. Besides that in this manner of proceeding he could ne∣ver act in concert, nor preserve any effectual communication with the several bodies of his allies. To push forward with his whole force directly to Berlin, could at best be regarded as a <HI>coup de main,</HI> which could prove nothing decisive in the campaign, even supposing the project should succeed; but it was rather probable that it would not succeed, as the King of Prus∣sia might clear his hands of the Russians before the army of M. Daun could, for want of subsis∣tance arrive in the Lower Lusatia. Every consideration therefore point∣ed out the relief of Saxony as the great object of the Austrian opera∣tions. It was an object apparently to be compassed with greater ease, and if compassed, productive of more solid advantages than any other. The army of the Empire already superior to that of Prince Henry could co-operate in the de∣sign, and the recovery of Saxony once affected, the King of Prussia would see himself entirely divested of one of the principal resourses he had to rely upon in the war, for money, provisions, and forage; whilst his hereditary dominions stripped of this strong barrier de∣fenceless in themselves, and assaulted on three sides by powerful armies, could scarce find them employment to the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>M. Daun having resolved upon his plan of operations suffered the King of Prussia to continue his march towards the Russians, with∣out any molestation: he contented himself with leaving a consider∣able body of troops under the Ge∣nerals Harsch, and de Ville, on the southern frontiers of Silesia, in order to form some enterprise on that side, which might draw the attention and forces of the Prussians as far as possible from the great ob∣ject of his operations. When he had made these dispositions he march∣ed towards Saxony, through the country of Lusatia, by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen. His first project was bold. He proposed to cross the Elbe at Meissen; by which the communication between Dresden and Leipsic would be cut off at one stroke. Then he proposed to attack Prince Henry in his camp at Sedlitz, whilst the army of the Em∣pire fell upon him in another quarter. Thus the Prince was to be put be∣tween two fires, and his retreat un∣to Dresden to be rendered impracti∣cable; but upon mature considera∣tion, this project was laid aside. M. Daun reflected that the for∣tress of Sonnestein, of which he was not yet in possession, would prove no small impe∣diment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3.</NOTE> to his designs. He considered that the position of Prince Henry op∣posite to the army of the Empire was too advantageous, to make an attack upon him adviseable: and unless the Prince could be induced to attack the Imperialists first, a point not to be expected in his circumstances, he might always find it easy to throw himself into Dresden, and by pro∣per
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>
motions to preserve a free-com∣munication with the King. M. Daun was obliged to renounce his first de∣sign, but he was left at full liberty to form and to execute such other plans for the relief of Saxony as his prudence could suggest.</P>
<P>About that time the Imperial court elated with their recent suc∣cess, began to shew with what moderation they were likely to behave if it continued and in∣creased. They entirely threw off all the little appearance of respect they had hitherto retained for the King of Great Britain, and seve∣ral other of the most respectable Princes and persons of the Empire. They made the abuse of their au∣thority go hand in hand with the success of their arms. On the 21st of August a conclusum of the Aulic council was issued against the King of Great Britain, as E∣lector of Hanover, against the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, against Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, the Count of Lippe Buckebourg, and in general against all the ad∣herents to the King of Prussia, threatening them with penalties in dignity, person and estate. In con∣sequence of this decree, letters a∣vocatory were issued, notifying to the sovereign Princes, that if they did not within a limited time dis∣perse their armies, break off their connection with the King of Prus∣sia, pay their quota of Roman months, and send their contingents to the army of execution, they were to be put under the ban of the Empire. To all other persons who held any dignity in the Empire, orders were given and penalties were threatened suitable to their condition. They in short went all lengths but that of actually and formally putting them under the ban, which they would not have failed to do, if their success had answered its beginnings. So little regard had the court of Vienna to former services of the most interest∣ing nature; and so entirely did she seem to forget that she owed to the King of Great Britain, not only that power which she now unjustly and ungratefully turned a∣gainst him, but almost the very be∣ing of the house of Austria. So entirely did she forget that this Monarch had expended his trea∣sures, employed his armies, and even exposed his person in her cause, when it was not only abandoned, but attacked by almost all the rest of Europe. However the violent proceedings of the Aulic council, drew no one State or person from the Kings of Great Britain and Prussia; they rather had a contrary effect, in rousing the whole Evan∣gelic body to a sense of their own danger. Much less were they able to stop the progress of the al∣lied arms.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia conducted his retreat out of Bohemia in ad∣mirable order. The Generals Jah∣nus and Laudohn for several days hung upon his rear with two strong bodies. They took advantageous posts, sometimes on one side, some∣times on the other, sometimes to∣gether, sometimes separately, and threw all possible impediments in his way. But the vigour of the Prus∣sians drove them with loss from every post. So that by the 6th of August, they were obliged entirely to desist from their pursuit. The King of Prussia freed from this molestation marched with the utmost diligence by Wisoca, Politz, Landshut, and arriv∣ed on the 20th on Franckfort on the Oder. Here he joined the troops under Count Dohna. The army
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>
was now in a condition to act, and they did not lose <NOTE PLACE="marg">22d.</NOTE> a moment's time to march against the enemy. All their vigour and expedition was not more than ne∣cessary. The Russians had be∣sieged Custrin from the 15th. Though these people scarcely e∣merged from barbarism, had not the most perfect skill in operations of this nature, they supplied that deficiency by a ferocity that scrupled nothing, by numbers whose lives they did not regard, and by a most formidable artillery, which rudely but furiously managed, only spread the more general and indiscrimi∣nate destruction. In effect, they threw such a multitude of bombs and red hot balls into that un∣fortunate city, that in a short time, it was on fire in every quarter. Of the wretched inhabitants some were burned, some buried in the ruins, some killed by the balls that fell like hail in the streets: the survi∣ving majority safe neither with∣in nor without their houses, aban∣doned their homes and their sub∣stance, and fled, many of them al∣most naked, out of the city on the side which was not invested. Never was beheld a more de∣plorable spectacle; nor was it easy to say which formed the more wretched appearance, those who perished, or those who escaped. Meanwhile the Governor, firm in his courage and fidelity, did every thing for the defence of the walls and ruins of the place; but the walls built in the old manner did not promise a successful defence; the enemy had posted themselves in the suburbs, and in the firing of the town, the principal maga∣zine of the besieged was blown up.</P>
<P>The protector and avenger of his dominions, was now however at hand. On the 23d, the King of Prussia's whole army passed the Oder at Glustebissel, about twenty English miles to the north-east of Custrin. The Russians on the first notice of his approach, broke up the siege of that place, and march∣ed towards the villages of Zwicker and Zorndorff. It was the King's intention to wind round the left flank of their army, and to take them in the rear, by which he hoped to throw them into con∣fusion. But in this he found him∣self disappointed. The Russian Generals had foreseen his purpose and made excellent dispositions. As the ground did not admit them to extend greatly in length, they threw themselves into a square body composed of four lines, forming a front almost equal on every side, and on every side surrounded by cannon and chevaux de frize. In this formidable dispo∣sition they waited the attack of the Prussians.</P>
<P>It was on the 25th of August that the King of Prussia, after a march of 56 days, from the midst of Mo∣ravia, brought his army in presence of the Russians. The king had ne∣ver been personally engaged with that enemy before. His troops had never obtained any advan∣tage over them. The whole for∣tune of the war depended upon the event of this day. The Prussi∣ans were now in the closest sense to fight for their country, which was ready to fall under one of the severest scourges with which Pro∣vidence has chastised a nation. Nothing was wanting which could inspire the soldier with revenge. Every where the marks of the
<PB N="52" REF="64"/>
enemies cruelty were before their eyes; the country desolated on every side, and the villages in slames all round the field of battle.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock in the morn∣ing the battle began by a fire of cannon and mortars which rained on the right wing of the Russians without the least inter∣mission for near two hours. No∣thing could exceed the havock made by this terrible fire, nor the constancy with which the Mus∣covite foot, raw and unexperi∣enced, sustained a slaughter that would have confounded and dis∣persed the compleatest veterans. They fell in their ranks; new regiments still pressed forward to fill their places, and to supply new slaughter. When the first line had fired away all their charges, they rushed forward on the Prussi∣ans. That firm body of the Prussian infantry which had often stood, and often given so many terrible shocks, by one of those unaccountable movements of the human mind, that render every thing in war so precarious, gave way in the presence of their So∣vereign, and when they had in a manner secured the victory, retired in disorder before the half broken battalions of the Muscovites. Had the Russian officers known how to profit of this disorder; had they immediately thrown in their horse with vigour to compleat it, and entirely break that body; this had probably been the last day of the Prussian greatness. The king was not so negligent. For just in this anxious moment, whilst the battle was yet in suspense, by a very rapid and masterly motion, he brought all the cavalry of his right to the center, which with General Sodlitz at their head, bursting in upon the Russian foot, uncovered by their horse, and dis∣ordered even by their advantage, they pushed them back with a most miserable slaughter The repulsed battalions of Prussia had time to recollect, and to form themselves; and now returning to the onset with a rage exasperated by their late disgrace, they en∣tirely turned the balance of the sight. The Russians were thrown into the most horrible confusion. The wind blew the dust and smoke full in their faces. They no longer distinguished friends or enemies. They fired upon each other. In this distraction they plundered their own baggage which stood between the lines, and intoxicated themselves with brandy. Orders were now no more heard or obeyed. The ranks fell in upon one another; and being crammed together in a narrow space, every shot dis∣charged by the Prussians had its full effect; whilst the Russians kept up only a scattered fire, without direction or effect, and quite over the heads of their ene∣mies. It was now no longer battle, but a horrid and undis∣tinguishing carnage. Yet still, (which is a wonderful circumstance) the Russians thus distracted and slaughtered, kept their ground. The action continued without in∣termission from nine in the morn∣ing until seven at night. At last the night itself, the fatigue of the Prussians, and a judicious attack on their right wing, which drew their attention on that side, gave the Russian army some respite to re∣cover their order, and an oppor∣tunity of retiring a little from the scene of their disaster. On their side near 10,000 fell upon
<PB N="53" REF="65"/>
the spot; they had more than 10,000 wounded, most of them mortally; 939 officers, not in∣cluding the inferior, were killed wounded and taken prisoners; of two particular regiments consisting before the battle of 4595 effective men, only 1475 were left; their whole loss on this bloody day was 21,529 men. That of the Prus∣sians in every way did not amount to 2000.</P>
<P>The Gazettes of both parties warmly disputed the vain honour of the field of battle. On the most diligent enquiry, it appears that both parties spent the night on or very near the place of action. But this is an affair of little consequence. The Prus∣sians had all the fruits, and most of the proofs of a victory the most complete and decisive. A vast train of artillery taken, the military chest, a number of pri∣soners, many of them officers of high rank; the retreat of the Russian army, the next and the fol∣lowing days; their General Fer∣mor's request for leave to bury the dead; their incapacity to advance or form any new enterprise; the King of Prussia's unmolested opera∣tions against his other enemies; all these form the most clear and cer∣tain demonstration of a victory in all the points, for which a victory is desirable.</P>
<P>Nothing less indeed, than a very compleat victory could have done any essential service to the King's affairs at that time, when four armies of his enemies were making their way to one common center, and threatened to unite in the heart of Brandenburg. The King renewed the attack on the Russians the next morning. The event of the last day had shewed them, that there was no way of safety but in a retreat, and in ef∣fect they retreated before the Prussians as far as Landsperg on the frontiers of Poland. The King of Prussia was convinced that their late check must wholly disable them from attempting any thing material against his dominions on that side; and he saw clearly that whatever he might hope to gain by improving his advantage a∣gainst the Russians, he must lose far more by allowing his other ene∣mies to make a progress on the side of Saxony. He satisfied him∣self therefore, with leaving a small body of troops under Count Dohna, to observe the motions of the Mus∣covite army; and marched with the greatest part of his forces and the utmost expedition to the relief of Prince Henry.</P>
<P>M. Daun having laid aside his first project for passing the Elbe at Meissen, enterprised nothing new on the side of Saxony for some days; he contented himself with taking a position at Stolpen to the Eastward of the Elbe, by which, whilst he preserved to himself an easy communication with the army of the Empire, he interrupted the communication between Bautzen and Dresden; he favoured the o∣perations of General Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Lusatia to the confines of Branden∣burgh; and by drawing the at∣tention of the Prussian forces which were left in Silesia to the northward of that dutchy, he facilitated the progress of the arms of the Generals Harach and de Ville in the southern parts. Admirable dispositions with∣out question, if the time had not called for more vigorous measures, and if the rescue of Saxony from the King of Prussia had not been
<PB N="54" REF="66"/>
the great object of the campaign! It is not impossible that the court of Vienna had still such an hankering after Silesia, as induced them to slacken their efforts on the side of Saxony, in hope, that if M. Daun could protract the operations there, so as to find full employment for the King of Prussia, their other forces might reduce Silesia with great facility; and thus perhaps by aiming at two such difficult objects at once, as it generally happens, they lost them both. Upon any other supposition, it is not very easy to account for the seeming inactivity of M. Daun, whilst he had so fair a game in his hands. However advantageously Prince Henry might have chosen his post, or however strongly he might have secured it, yet, the prodigious superiority of the combined armies seems to have more than over-ba∣lanced that advantage, and to have justified, nay, to have demanded some bold and decisive attempt.</P>
<P>In fact, this appeared at length to be the Marshal's own opinion. For when the strong fortress of Sonnestein most unac∣countably surrendered, with a gar∣rison of 1400 men, to the Austrian General Mac-Guire after the resistance of no more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 5.</NOTE> than a single day; M. Daun pro∣posed that the Prince of Deux-Ponts should attack Prince Henry, whilst the grand army of the Aus∣trians laying bridges between two fires, at a small distance from each other, should pass the Elbe, and falling at the same time on the Prussians, se∣cond <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10.</NOTE> the attack of the Imperialists, and cut off the retreat of their ene∣mies towards Dresden. This was to bring matters to a speedy de∣cision. But now the King of Prus∣sia by the most rapid marches had reached the frontiers of Saxony. The whole design was disconcert∣ed; and far from being able to dis∣lodge Prince Henry, they found themselves utterly unable to pre∣vent the King his brother from joining him, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11.</NOTE> his whole army. On his approach General Laudohn abandoned his ad∣vantages in the Lower Lusatia, and fell back upon M. Daun; who him∣self retired from the neighbourhood of Dresden and fell back as far as Zittau. The army of the Empire possessed of the strong post of Pirna, which the Saxons had oc∣cupied in the beginning of the war, kept their ground; but did not undertake any thing. Thus in fifteen days the King of Prussia, by his unparallelled spirit, dili∣gence, and magnanimity, fought, and defeated a superior body of his enemies, in one extremity of his dominions, and baffled without fighting another superior body in the other extremity.</P>
<P>These advantages, glorious as they were, were not the only ones which followed the victory at Zorndorf. The Swedes who di∣rected their motions by those of their Russian allies, hastened their operations when that army had ad∣vanced into Brandenburgh. Ge∣neral Wedel was detached from Saxony, to stop their progress; and the Prince of Bevern, now Go∣vernor of Stein, gave them some opposition. All this, however, had proved ineffectual, if the news of the defeat of the Russians had not alarmed the Swedes in such a man∣ner, as to make them return with more expedition than they had advanced. Tho' the King of Prus∣sia's affairs began to put on a bet∣ter appearance by these efforts, the
<PB N="55" REF="67"/>
fortune of the war still hung in a very dubious scale. The enemy was still superior. The Swedes and Russians had still some foot∣ing in his dominions. The Au∣strians and Imperialists were yet in Saxony; and if the King's ar∣mies had it in their power to take strong situations; the enemy had the same advantages. The con∣dition of things was extremely critical, and the least error or mis∣fortune threatened still to plunge the King of Prussia into an abyss of calamities.</P>

<P>THE operations of the armies in Westphalia, seemed for a long time to languish. The grand army of the French under M. de Contades, was wholly unable to drive Prince Ferdinand from the posts which he had chosen so ju∣diciously along the Lippe. The other division of the French for∣ces under the Prince de Soubise, had made no great progress on the side of Hesse-Cassel, against the Prince Isenburg, who still kept his ground in that principality, in or∣der to protect the course of the Weser, and to cover the electo∣rate. The French were sensible that an attack on the principal army of the allies, would prove a very dangerous attempt, in which even if they should have some suc∣cess, their progress into the King's electoral dominions must be very slow and difficult. But as the body of the allies employed in Hesse Cassel was far the weakest, and as an advantage on that side promised them the command of the Weser, and a better passage into the heart of the enemies coun∣try, they determined to make an attempt there. To further this design, a considerable detachment was made from the army of M. de Contades, which increased the Prince of Soubise's corps to at least 30,000 men. Prince Ferdinand, who was sufficiently aware of the enemies plan, had some time be∣fore sent General Oberg with a strong reinforcement to join the Prince Isenburg; but notwithstand∣ing this reinforcement, the whole force of the allies in Hesse did not exceed 15000. This body was at∣tacked by the French at Lanwerenhagen, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 30.</NOTE> their great superiority, especially in point of cavalry, obliged the allies to retire with the loss of about 1500 men. The allies unable to keep the field, had however some woods in their rear which covered their re∣treat, and they preserved so good a countenance as prevented their defeat from becoming total.</P>
<P>Great consequences might have been apprehended from this affair.
<PB N="56" REF="68"/>
But the vigilance of Prince Ferdi∣nand, who had established the most ready communications all along the Lippe, suffered the victorious army to reap but little advantage from their victory. That accomplished General advanced with the utmost expedition towards Rheda, and the Prince Isenburg having fallen back upon him, they joined in such a manner as perfectly to secure the Weser, without losing any thing on the side of the Rhine. And al∣though these necessary motions, in some sort uncovered the electorate, so as to lay it open to the incursions of the enemies light troops, who penetrated even to the gates of Ha∣nover; yet the French were not in a condition to establish any considerable body, or to take any post of moment in that part.</P>
<P>During this time, the armies of the King of Prussia and M. Daun, made no very remarkable move∣ments. The Marshal kept his ad∣vantageous camp at Stolpen, by which he preserved a communica∣tion with the army of the Em∣pire. The army was secured by its inaccessible situation, but it enterprised nothing of consequence. The King of Prussia on the other hand, having taken possession of the important post of Bautzen, which lies so opportunely for com∣manding at once both Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a and Lusatia, extended his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wing to Hohkirch. By this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he preserved a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with the army of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Henry, he protected <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the incursions of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he secured these interesting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, he was better situated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> throwing succours into Siles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, that he c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld be any where else con∣sistently with his general plan. The two armies kept the most watch∣ful eye upon each others motions. The principal aim of the King of Prussia, seemed to have been the preventing M. Daun from commu∣nicating with Bohemia. The great intention of M. Daun was to cut off the King from Silesia. Things were so ballanced, that it did not seem possible by mere skill in marches and positions to answer these ends very fully: therefore a battle seemed inevitable. But it seemed too that considering the situa∣tions of both armies, a battle could not be attempted without extreme danger to the party who should be∣gin the attack.</P>
<P>M. Daun saw that if any more time was lost without action, the very season must oblige him to evacuate Saxony, and thus give up all the fruits of the campaign. He came to a resolution of giving the King of Prussia battle. But even in the vigour of this resolution, appeared the extreme caution which characterises that able General. Having communicated his design to the Prince of Deux-Ponts, and settled measures with him, he march∣ed in the dead of a very dark night, in three columns, towards the right of the King of Prussia's camp. Notwithstanding the dark∣ness of the night, notwith∣standing the necessary di∣vision <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 14.</NOTE> of the Austrian army, the greatness of their numbers, and the length of way they had to march, yet such was the wise conduct and great good fortune of this design, that they all arrived at the same time at the Prussian camp, none having lost their way, without dis∣covery, without confusion, and be∣gan the attack with the utmost regularity and resolution at 5 o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69"/>
How the King's out guards were kept so as to make such a sur∣prise practicable, is hard to say. It is hard to accuse the vigilance of so able a commander, or the attention of so many finished officers as served under him. To speak of treachery is a way of accounting for misfortunes, more common than reasonable. However it was, the Prussians had not time to strike their tents, when they found the enemy in the midst of the camp, and an impetuous attack already begun. Scarce had the battle be∣gan, when a defeat seemed cer∣tain; not so much from the con∣fusion of the troops, as the irre∣parable loss of two officers in the highest command, and of the greatest merit. M. Keith received two musquet balls, and fell dead upon the spot. Prince Francis of Brunswick had his head shot off by a cannon ball as he mounted his horse. The King of Prussia had then the whole of affairs to sustain alone, at the time when he most wanted assistance. But his presence of mind, his firmness, his activity, remedied in some measure the effects of this unforeseen at∣tack, and the losses and disorders it had occasioned; he was every where present, and inspired his troops with an ardor like his own. The King ordered some detach∣ments from his left, to reinforce his right wing; but in the moment the Orders were received, the left itself was furiously attacked. General Retzow who commanded in that quarter, with difficulty repulsed the Austrians, and was not able to af∣ford any considerable assistance to the right, which was alone obliged to support the whole weight of the grand attack.</P>
<P>The Austrians in the beginning of the engagement had beaten them out of the village of Hoh∣kirchen; as the fate of the day depended upon that post, the hot∣test of the dispute was there. The Prussians made three bloody and unsuccessful attacks on the vil∣lage; on the fourth they carried it; but the Austrians pouring con∣tinually fresh troops upon that spot, drove them out at length after reiterated efforts, and a prodigious slaughter on all sides. Then the King despairing of the fortune of that field, ordered a retreat; his troops which had been suddenly attacked in a dark night by superior numbers, and had run to arms some half naked, and all in the utmost confusion, had notwithstand∣ing made a most vigorous resistance, and maintained the fight for near five hours. They made their re∣treat in good order without being pursued, supported by the good countenance of their cavalry, and the fire of a numerous and well served artillery, which was placed in the center of their camp. They lost in this bloody action at least 7000 men, killed, wounded and prisoners, together with many cannon. The Austrian account allowed their own loss in killed and wounded to amount to near 5000.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia, in re∣tiring from Hohkirchen, in fact only altered the position of his right wing, which fell back as far as Weissenberg. His left still re∣mained at Bautzen. This position was nearly as good as the former. The great loss, was the loss of reputation which always attends a defeat, and the loss of two great Generals which attended this in particular. M. Keith was a Scotchman born. He engaged with his brother the Lord Marshal in the Rebellion of 1715.
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>
Being obliged to relinquish his country on this occasion, he en∣tered into the troops of Spain, and afterwards passing into Russia, he obtained a considerable com∣mand, and performed many signal services in their wars with Turky and Sweden; and served them also in peace by several embassies. But finding the honours of that country no better than a splendid servitude, and not meeting with those rewards, which his long and faithful services deserved, he left that court for one where merit is better known and better re∣warded; and having been employ∣ed since the beginning of the war in a distinguished command in the King of Prussia's armies, he fell at last in a service that was worthy of him.</P>
<P>If the King of Prussia lost some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>outation in suffering himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> surprised in this affair; he fully retrieved it by his extra∣ordinary conduct in the course of the action, and his admirable efforts after it. On the whole, per∣haps, when all circumstances are considered, the King of Prussia will appear greater in this defeat, than in any victory he ever yet obtained. The wing of his army that was attacked, was surprised at a distance from him, the two Generals that commanded it slain in the first onset, his other prin∣cipal Generals wounded, the whole wing in confusion without a lea∣der; to come, in these desperate circumstances, in haste from ano∣ther quarter; to recover all; twice to repulse the enemy, and at last to retire, overborn only by numbers and fatigue, without being pursued, is such an instance of great Generalship, as perhaps has never been exceeded.</P>
<P>Whilst these things were do∣ing in Saxony, the Russians made no farther attempts on the side of Brandenburgh; they remained in their camp near Landsperg, until the 21st of September; when after several feigned motions, made to cover their real design, they began their retreat towards Po∣merania, where they arrived on the 26th.</P>
<P>It was impossible that they should keep their ground in that province during the winter, un∣less they could secure some sea∣port, from whence they might be supplied with provisions. The little town of Colberg was very opportune for that purpose, as it is a sea-port on the Baltick, and so meanly fortified, that the re∣duction of it appeared to be as easy as expedient. On the third of October, they formed the siege of this inconsiderable place, with a body of 15000 men. But such was the bravery of Major Heydon the Governor; and such the inca∣pacity of the Russians for opera∣tions of this nature, that this little town, defended only by a ram∣part, without any outwork, and lined with a very feeble garrison, held out against the repeated at∣tacks of the enemy twenty-six days, and then obliged them to raise the siege, without any <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 29.</NOTE> succours whatsoever from without. This was the last enterprise of the Russians. Their vast army retired with disgrace, first from Branden∣burgh, and then from Pomerania; not having been able to master one place of strength in either country; but having destroyed with the most savage barbarity in both the open towns and defenceless villages; leaving as strong impressions of con∣tempt
<PB N="59" REF="71"/>
for the incapacity, as of hor∣ror for their cruelty.</P>
<P>After the defeat which the King received at Hohkirchen, he omitted no measures to prevent the enemy from making any material advan∣tage of it. He perceived clearly, that the advantage they proposed to derive from it, was to cover the operations of their armies in Silesia; and that they had no longer any se∣rious design upon Saxony during this campaign. The King therefore, made no scruple to reinforce his army by considerable detachments from that of Prince Henry, which were brought up by that Prince himself. And as he saw that Neiss, the siege of which had been already formed and prosecuted with great vigour, must certainly surrender if it were not speedily succoured, he resolved to march into Silesia.</P>
<P>To the execution of this design the greatest difficulties started up¦on all sides. The army of M. Daun lately victorious, had no other busi∣ness than to intercept him. To fight was dubious; to avoid it hard. If he could even avoid a battle, he had much to apprehend from the efforts of the enemy to harass him on his march. If he should be so happy as to escape or to conquer these difficulties, yet his march en∣tirely uncovered Saxony, and aban∣doned that most interesting possession, very poorly defended, to all the force of two powerful armies.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the con∣sideration of Saxony should detain him in his present situation, Silesia ran the same risque, and the same or greater disadvantages must ensue to his affairs, by suffering the Aus∣trians to obtain a footing there. This dilemma, which would have rendered a meaner genius entirely inactive, and hindered him from taking any resolution, only obliged the King of Prussia to take his re∣solution with the greater speed, and to execute it with the greater vigour.</P>
<P>On the 24th of November at night he quitted his camp at Do∣breschutz, and making a great com∣pass, he arrived, without any ob∣struction from the enemy, in the plain of Gorlitz. A body of the Austrians had in vain endeavoured to secure this post before him; those that arrived were defeated, with the loss of eight hundred men. By this happy march, all the advantages of M. Daun's studied position, of all the fruits his boasted victory at Hohkir∣chen, were lost in a moment, and an open passage to Silesia lay before the King. He pursued his march with the greatest diligence. General Laudohn, with 24,000 men, was sent to pursue him. That active General continually harassed his rear Guard; but the King continued his march without interruption, and suffered him to take many little advantages, rather than by delay∣ing to contest small matters, to en∣danger a design, which might be de∣cisive of the whole campaign.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Daun, not content with the obstacles which General Laudohn threw in the King's way, sent a large body of horse and foot by another rout to reinforce the army which under the Generals Harsch and De Ville had formed the siege of Neiss, and the blockade of Cosel. But he per∣ceived that all these measures would probably prove ineffectual, as his principal project, which was to co∣ver Silesia, had been defeated. He therefore turned his views towards Saxony and satisfying himself with detaching General Laudohn, which might create an opinion that the
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>
whole Austrian army pursued, he followed the king no farther than Gorlitz; which place he immediate∣ly quitted, and having by forced marches gained the Elbe, he passed that river at Pirna, and ad∣vanced <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 6.</NOTE> towards Dresden. At the same time the army of the Em∣pire, by its motions having obliged the Prussian army then extremely weakened by the detachments that had been drawn from it, to retire from its post before Dresden, some miles to the westward of that city, cut off their communica∣tion with Leipsic, whilst M. Daun attempted to cut off their commu∣nication with Dresden; but they found means to throw themselves into that city, and afterwards to retire to the other side of the Elbe. The Austrians and Imperialists be∣gan at once to invest those two im∣portant places; another party ad∣vanced towards Torgau, and at∣tempted that town. It seemed ut∣terly impossible to prevent the Aus∣trians from becoming masters of Saxony, who in a manner covered the whole country with their forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of Prussia drew nearer and nearer to Neiss. The siege of that fortress was commenced on the 4th of Au∣gust; on the 3d of October it was completely invested; and the place was pushed on one side with the greatest vigour, and on the other maintained with the most consum∣mate skill and bravery, until the approach of the king of Prussia obliged the Austrians, on the 1st of November, to raise the siege, leaving a considerable quantity of military stores behind them. The same terror obliged the parties em∣ployed in the blockade of Cosel, to leave that place at liberty, and to fall back, together with the ar∣mies of the Generals Harsch and De Ville, into Bohemia, and the Austrian Silesia.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia, when he had thus by the report of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9.</NOTE> his march, without fighting, driven his enemies out of Silesia, lost not a moment to return by the same route, and with the same expedi∣tion to the relief of Saxony. Two bodies of his troops had moved for the same purpose out of Pomera∣nia, one under Count Dohna, and one under General Wedel. The corps under Wedel had thrown itself into Torgau, repulsed the Austrians, who had attempted that place, and pursued them as far as Eulenburg. The grand operation of the Austrians was against Dres∣den. M. Daun, with an army of 60,000 men, came before that city, on the very day on which the King of Prussia began his march to op∣pose him, so that he might well imagine his success certain against a place meanly fortified, and de∣fended only by 12000 men. The same day he began to cannonade it, and his light troops, supported by the grenadiers of the army, made a sharp attack upon the suburbs. The Governor Count Schmettau saw that from the weakness of the suburbs it would prove impossible for him to prevent the enemy from possessing themselves of them by a <HI>coup de main,</HI> and if they succeeded in this attempt the great height of the houses, being six or seven stories, and entirely commanding the ramparts, would render the reduction of the body of the place equally easy and certain. These considerations deter∣mined him to set these suburbs on fire.</P>
<P>It is well known that the suburbs of Dresden compose one of the sinest towns in Europe, and are
<PB N="61" REF="73"/>
greatly superior to that which lies within the walls. Here the most wealthy part of the inhabitants re∣side, and here are carried on those several curious manufactures for which Dresden is so famous. Count Daun foresaw this consequence of his attempt. He endeavoured to intimidate the Governor from this measure, to which he knew the cruel reason of war would naturally lead him, by threatening to make him personally answerable for the steps he should take; but Count Schmettau answered with the firm∣ness that became a man of honour and a soldier, that he would an∣swer whatever he should do, and would not only burn the suburbs, in case M. Daun advanced, but would likewise defend the city it∣self street by street, and at last even the castle, which was the royal re∣sidence, if he should be driven to it. When the magistrates were ap∣prized of this resolution, they fell at the feet of Count Schmettau, and implored him to change his mind, and to have mercy on that devoted part of their city. The part of the royal family, who remained in Dresden, joined their supplications to those of the magistrates; they prayed him to spare that last refuge of distressed royalty, and to allow at least a secure residence to those, who had been deprived of every thing else. All entreaties were vain. Schmettau continued firm in his re∣solution. He told them that their safety depended on themselves, and on M. Daun; that if he made no attempts, the suburbs should be still secure; but that if he took any farther steps, the necessity of his master's service, and his own ho∣nour, would compel him to act very disagreeable to the lenity of his disposition. The Magistrates retired in despair. Combustibles were laid in all the houses.</P>
<P>At three o'clock next morning, the signal for fir∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 10.</NOTE> the suburbs was given, and in a moment a place so late∣ly the seat of ease and luxury, flourishing in traffick, in pleasures, and ingenious arts, was all in flames. A calamity so dreadful needs no high colouring. However, as little mischief attended such a combustion, as the nature of the thing could admit. Very few lost their lives; but many their whole substance. When this was done, the Prussian troops abandoned the flaming suburbs, and retired in good order into the city.</P>
<P>M. Daun saw this fire, which, whilst it laid waste the capital of his ally, made it more difficult for him to force it, he sent in some empty threats to the Governor. But the Saxon minister at Ratisbon, made grievous complaints to the Diet, of what he represented as the most unparalleled act of wanton and un∣provoked cruelty, that had ever been committed. The emissaries of the court of Vienna spread the same complaints; and they made no scruple to invent, and to alter facts in such a manner as to move the greatest pity towards the suffer∣ers, and the greatest indignation against the King of Prussia. All these, however, were in a short time abundantly confuted, by the authentick certificates of the ma∣gistrates of Dresden, and of those officers of the court, who were per∣fectly acquainted with the transac∣tion. By these certificates it ap∣pears, that only two hundred and fifty houses were consumed. Tho' this was a terrible calamity, it was nothing to the accounts given in the gazettes of the Austrian faction.
<PB N="62" REF="74"/>
By these certificates it appears also, that the people were not surprised, but had sufficient notice of the Go∣vernor's intentions, to enable them to provide for their safety. In a word, all the charges of cruelty against the Prussian commander, and soldiery were fully over∣thrown.</P>
<P>This fire made a <HI>coup de main</HI> im∣practicable; regular operations de∣manded time, and the King of Prussia was now in full march to∣wards Saxony. M. Daun retired from before the place on the 17th. The King after crossing Lusatia, passing the Elbe and joining his troops under Count Dohna and General Wedel, arrived trium∣phantly at Drefden on the 20th. The armies of M. Daun and the Empire gave way towards Bohe∣mia, into which kingdom they soon after finally retreated, without enterprising any thing further. Six sieges were raised almost at the same time; that of Colberg, car∣ried on by General Palmbach, un∣der the orders of Marshal Fermor; that of Neiss, by M: de Harsch; that of Cosel; that of Dresden by Marshal Daun; the blockade of Torgau by M. Haddic; and that of Leipsick by the prince of Deux-Ponts.</P>
<P>About the time that the Austrians retired into winter quarters, the French did the same; and the Ha∣noverians permitted them to do it without molestation, the season be∣ing too far advanced, and their army perhaps not of sufficient strength for offensive operations; and Prince Ferdinand kept the field no longer. The British troops had no occasion of signalizing their bravery during this year; but without a battle the nation suffer∣ed a very considerable loss, and was touched with a very deep and general sorrow. The Duke of Marlborough died in Munster, the 20th of October, of a fever, con∣tracted by the fatigues of the cam∣paign. Never did the Nation lose in one man, a temper more candid and benevolent, manners more a∣miable and open, a more primitive integrity, a more exalted generosity, a more warm and feeling heart. He left all the enjoyments, which an ample fortune and an high rank could bestow in the publick eye; and which every milder virtue, every disposition to make and to be made happy, could give in a domes∣tic life: he left these for the service of his country, and died for its de∣fence, as he had lived for its ornament and happiness.</P>
<P>If we compare the events of this year with those of the last, we shall find in the actions of the present year, perhaps something less of that astonishing eclat; fewer battles; not so many nor so striking revolu∣tions of fortune; but we may dis∣cover upon all sides far greater ma∣nagement, and a more studied and refined conduct; more artful move∣ments, a more judicious choice of posts, more quick and vigorous marches. If in the last year, the King of Prussia was the hero of the imagination, he is this year the hero of the judgment; and we have, I think, reason to admire him upon juster principles. Obliged to evacuate Moravia, he throws him∣self into Bohemia, and executes a re∣treat with all the spirit of an invasion. He marches more than an hundred miles through an enemy's country, followed and harassed by large armies, who are unable to obtain any advantage over him. Gaining at length his own territories, he engages the vast army of the Rus∣sians
<PB N="63" REF="75"/>
and defeats it. He is un∣able to follow his blow, but he disables them from striking any blow against that part of his do∣minions, which he is obliged to leave. Whilst he is engaged with the Russians on the frontiers of Poland, the Austrians and Imperia∣lists enter Saxony. Before they can do any thing decisive, the King is himself suddenly in Saxony, and by his presence, at once discon∣certs all their projects. The scene is again changed, they surprise him in his camp at Hohkirchen, two of his Generals are killed, his army defeated, his camp is taken. They attack Silesia with a formidable army. Notwithstanding his late defeat; notwithstanding the great superiority of his ene∣mies; notwithstanding the advan∣tage of their posts; he makes an amazing sweep about all their forces, eludes their vigilance, renders their positions unprofitable; and march∣ing with an astonishing rapidity into the remotest parts of Silesia, obliges the Austrian armies to re∣tire with precipitation out of that province. Then he flies to the relief of Saxony, which his enemies had again profited of his absence to invade; and again by the same rapid and well conducted march, he obliges them to abandon their prize. Defeated by the Au∣strians he acquired by his conduct all the advantages of the most compleat victory. He guarded all his possessions in such a manner, as to enable them all to endure his ab∣sence for some short time; and he conducted his marches with such spirit, as did not make it necessary to them to hold out any longer; he made twice the circuit of his domi∣nions, and in their turn he relieved them all.</P>
<P>Nor was the conduct of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick less wor∣thy of admiration. Placed at the head of a body of troops, who were but lately obliged to lay down their arms, he found the enemy in possession of the whole open country, and of all the strong places in it. Commencing the cam∣paign in the midst of a severe win∣ter, without any place of strength in his hands, he drove the enemy from all those they held. He obliged them to repass the Rhine, he followed and defeated them in a pitched battle. Being after∣wards obliged by the great force of France on its own frontier, and the numerous armies they had in different places, to repass the Rhine; he defended Lippe a∣gainst numbers greatly superior, and though they defeated a part of his army, they were not able to turn their victory to the least ad∣vantage. Prince Ferdinand's cam∣paign may well pass for a perfect mo∣del of defensive operations.</P>
<P>The Austrians, in taking win∣ter quarters, disposed their forces so as to form a chain of an a∣mazing length, from the frontiers of Moravia passing through Bohemia, all along the skirts of Silesia and the borders of Saxony. There the Imperial army joined this chain, and continued it through Thuringia and Franconia, where it was united to the quarters of the Prince De Soubise. These troops had fallen back from Hesse Cassel, finding themselves unable to maintain their ground in the landgraviate. The Prince de Soubise's cantonments extended westward along the course of the Maine and Lahn, to meet those of the M. de Contades which stretched to the Rhine, and continued the chain beyond it quite to the
<PB N="64" REF="76"/>
Maese, so as to command the whole course of the Rhine, on both sides, both upward and downward. Prince Ferdinand was unable to extend himself to such a length; and especially found it impracti∣cable to establish quarters on the other side of the Rhine; but he disposed his troops in the most ad∣vantageous manner in the bishoprics of Munster, Paderborn, and Hilde∣sheim, and in the landgraviate of Hesse Cassel. The several bodies may all unite with ease, and sup∣port each other. To preserve a communication between this and the Prussian army, as well as to break some part of that formidable chain of the enemy, the King sent some bodies of his troops into Thuringia, who dispossessed the army of the Empire of several of their posts there, and they now threaten to pe∣netrate still farther.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia, when he had a second time driven the Austri∣ans and Imperialists out of Saxony, resolved to keep no measures with that unhappy country. He declar∣ed that he was resolved no longer to consider it as a deposit, but as a country which he had twice sub∣dued by his arms. He therefore ordered those of the King of Po∣land's privy council, who still re∣mained at Dresden to retire at a very short warning. But if the King of Prussia had a right, as perhaps he had, to consider Saxony as a lawful conquest, he certainly seem∣ed not to consider the people as subjects, when he continued to ex∣act the most severe contributions; and in a manner too very little be∣coming a lawful sovereign; for he surrounded the exchange with sol∣diers, and confining the merchants in narrow lodgings on straw beds, he obliged them by extreme suf∣fering, to draw bills on their fo∣reign correspondents for very large sums. This city had been quite exhausted by former payments, and had not long before suffered mili∣tary execution. An enemy that acted thus, had acted severely; but when a country is entirely possessed by any power, and claim∣ed as a conquest, the rights of war seem to cease; and the people have a claim to be governed in such a manner as becomes a just Prince; especially when no extreme necessity in his affairs compels him to these rigorous courses. To re∣taliate on these miserable people some part of the cruelties committed by the Russians on his dominions seems to be very unreasonable, as it is but too obvious, that the barbarity of that people could not be re∣strained, however it might be exas∣perated by the total destruction of Saxony. Such retaliations are odious and cruel. We heartily wish we could praise the King of Prussia as much for his temperate use of his conquest, as for those wonderful and heroic qualities by which he obtained it. We might be con∣sidered as partial in our account, if we had omitted to take notice of what is alledged against the King of Prussia, when we have spoken so fully of the outrages committed by his enemies. It is now time to turn our eyes from this great theatre to∣wards lesser events, but such as will employ us altogether as agreeably; the operations of the British fleets and armies in Europe and America against the French.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>The burning of the ships at St. Maloes. Taking of Cherbourg. Defeat at St. Cas. Operations in America. Siege and taking of Louisbourg. English army defeated at Ticonderoga. They take Frontenac. The French aban∣don Fort du Quesne. Conclusion of the annals of the year</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this year, the good condition of our navy and our army; the spirit and popularity of the ministry; the wise choice of commanders, in contempt of vul∣gar and trivial maxims; the preva∣lence of the contrary to all these amongst the enemy; gave us the best grounded hopes of a vigorous and successful campaign. Concerning the theatre of our operations there was some doubt. It was the opinion of some, that our push in Europe should be made on the side of Germany; and that we ought to strengthen the army of Prince Fer∣dinand with such a respectable bo∣dy of troops, as might enable that finished commander to exert all his talents, and improve to the utmost the advantages he had already obtain∣ed over the French. They imagin∣ed, that if an early and consider∣able reinforcement were sent to the Prince, whilst the French army was yet in a distressed condition, and if in this condition that should receive any considerable blow, they would find it extremely difficult to retrieve it: and receiving this blow, on the frontier of their own territories, the Prince might carry the war into France itself; and thus very proba∣bly bring matters to a speedy deci∣sion. That in pursuing this plan a diversion on the coast of France was by no means excluded: and that on the contrary it must, on this plan, be attended with consequences infinitely more important than it could other∣wise; that otherwise, France might laugh at the little desultory efforts of an handful of men, who were to be embarked and disembarked with great difficulty and hazard, and which would always be obliged to fly at the first approach of an ene∣my. That whilst the French had only an army, greatly inferior in number to engage on the side of Germany, they would always find themselves well able to act abroad, and defend themselves at home.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was strong∣ly urged, that we ought to make the destruction of the French ma∣rine our great object, and to consi∣der all continental operations only in a secondary light. That in send∣ing a large body of English troops to the King's army on the Rhine, we must necessarily weaken our ef∣forts in America, and on the coast of France; and by drawing away all our forces, we must shake that internal security, which invigorated all our operations abroad. That whilst we maintained an army of 50,000 foreigners in Germany, it would be the greatest imprudence to send also a large body of our own national troops into the same country, and by that means not only squander away our men, but employ almost every penny granted for the land service, out of Great Britain; a method which could not fail of exhausting us in a very short time. That the force already in Germany was sufficient to keep the French engaged, and that the proposed expeditions to France
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
would, by attacking the coast, now in one part, now in another, and keeping all parts in continual alarms, necessarily detain a very considerable part of their forces at home, and thus make a powerful diversion, whilst it was pursuing what ought to be the grand perpe∣tual object of all our operations, the destruction of the French mari∣time power.</P>
<P>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was however so far modified by the arguments on the other side, that after some time a few regiments were sent into Germany, as we have before related. These and better reasons, no doubt, de∣termined the operations on the coast of France; but whilst the ne∣cessary preparations were making, their destination was kept an invio∣lable secret; and now, as they had the year before, inspired France with no little terror. Two squa∣drons, by the latter end of May, were in readiness for sailing. The greater under Lord Anson, the smaller under Commodore Howe, which was so designed to convoy the transports, and to favour the landing and reimbarkment. The land forces consisted of sixteen bat∣talions, and nine troops of light horse: they were commanded by the late Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>They sailed from Ports∣mouth; but as soon as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1.</NOTE> fleet set sail, the squadron of my Lord Anson separated from the rest, and bore off to the Bay of Biscay, in order to spread the alarm more widely, and to observe the French squadron in Brest. The other part of the fleet, which was commanded by Commodore Howe, with the transports, arrived without any ac∣cident in Cancalle Bay, at a small distance from the city of St. Maloes. Here the troops landed without opposition, and having for∣tified a post near Cancalle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5th.</NOTE> (a post by nature well fitted for de∣fence) for the security of their re∣treat, they marched in two columns to St. Maloes. When the army ar∣rived there it was soon visible, that the town, strongly situated on a pen∣insula, communicating with the main land only by a long and narrow causeway, was by no means a pro∣per object of a <HI>coup de main;</HI> and though for want of outworks, it was ill qualified to sustain a regular siege; yet our forces were, for want of strength and artillery sufficient, altogether as ill qualified for such an operation. They were therefore contented with setting fire to about an hundred sail of shipping, many of them privateers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">8th.</NOTE> which lay under the cannon of the town, and to several magazines filled with naval stores. The da∣mage was very considerable; yet, what is to be remarked, the enemy did not fire a single shot on the de∣tachment employed in this service: Having nothing more to do on this side, they retired to Cancalle; and reimbarked with as little opposition as they met <NOTE PLACE="marg">12th.</NOTE> with at landing; the land and sea commanders having made all the dispositions with great judge∣ment.</P>
<P>Before the fleet returned, they reconnoitred the town of Gran∣ville on the coast of Normandy; but finding that a large body of troops were encamped in the neighbourhood, they made no at∣tempt there. From thence they moved towards Cherbourg, and made the proper dispositions for landing near that place; but a hard gale blowing in to the shore, and the transports beginning to fall
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
soul on each other, it became ex∣tremely hazardous to attempt land∣ing. Besides, the provision was near exhausted, and the soldiers by being so long cooped up in the transports, were grown sickly. It became highly necessary to return home; and they arrived at St. Helen's on the 29th of June.</P>
<P>The success of this expedition, by which the French suffered large∣ly, with scarce any loss on our side, though it sufficiently answer∣ed the intention of the armament, fell somewhat short of the expec∣tations of the public, who had formed much greater hopes, than it was possible for the nature of such enterprises to fulfil. However, their hopes were again revived; by seeing that every thing was pre∣pared for another expedition, and that our armies and fleets were to be kept in constant action dur∣ing the summer. The time was now come when we were to turn the tables upon France, and to retaliate by real attacks, the terrors which had been raised by her me∣naces of an invasion. The Duke of Marborough had now taken the command of the English forces in Germany; and General Bligh suc∣ceeded him in this command. Prince Edward resolved to go upon the ex∣pedition, and to form himself for the service of his country under so brave and able a commander as Howe. It is easy to imagine, how much the spirit, the presence and example of the gallant young Prince, who went with the utmost chearfulness through all the detail of a midshipman's duty, inspired both in the seamen and the troops.</P>
<P>On the first of August, the fleet set sail from St. Helen's. In a few days they came to anchor before Cher∣bourg. The French had drawn a line strengthened by forts, along the most probable places for land∣ing. They had drawn down three regiments of regular troops, and a considerable body of militia to the shore, and had in all appear∣ance threatened a very resolute opposition to the descent of the English forces. But the Commo∣dore disposed the men of war and bomb ketches so judiciously, and made so sharp a fire upon the enemy, that they never ventured out of their entrenchments; so that the landing was ef∣fected <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 6.</NOTE> in excellent order, and with very little loss. The French who made so poor an opposition to the landing, had still many ad∣vantages from the nature of the ground which they occupied; but they neglected them all; and aban∣doning by a most shameful despair their forts and lines on the coast, they suffered the English to enter Cherbourg the day after the land∣ing, without throwing the least ob∣stacle in their way. It must be remembered too, that the whole number of the English forces on this expedition was rather short of 6000 men.</P>
<P>Cherburg is on the land side an open town; neither is it very strongly defended towards the sea. The harbour is naturally bad. But the place is well situated, in the midst of the channel, for protecting the French, and annoying the Eng∣lish commerce in time of war, and perhaps for facilitating an in∣vasion on England itself. Monsieur Belidor the famous engineer, had demonstrated its importance, and proposed a plan for the improve∣ment and defence of the harbour as well as for the fortifications of the town. This plan was approved
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
and partly put in execution by the building of a mole, digging a bason and making sluices and flood gates with excellent materials and a vast expence. The work had been for a considerable time dis∣continued; but in this expedition, that work of so great ingenuity, charge, and labour, was totally destroyed. Whilst our humanity re∣grets the unhappy necessity of war, we cannot help thinking that the English nation was freed by the success of this expedition, from what might one day be cause of no trivial alarms.</P>
<P>When this work of dectruction was over, all the vessels in the harbour burned, and hostages ta∣ken for the contributions levied on <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th.</NOTE> the town, the forces reim∣barked, with great speed and safety without any interruption from the enemy, and with the same expedition, care and conduct, as they had been first landed; the army having continued ten days unmolest∣ed in France.</P>
<P>The nation exulted greatly in this advantage, especially as it almost accompanied the news of our glorious successes in America. Nothing was omitted to give the action its utmost eclat; the brass cannon and mortars taken at Cher∣bourg, were drawn from Kensing∣ton to the tower, quite through the city, in great pomp and or∣der, adorned with stream∣ers, attended by guards, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16.</NOTE> drums, music, and whatever else might draw the attention of the vul∣gar. They who censured this pro∣cession as too ostentatious, did not consider, how forcibly things of this nature strike upon ordinary minds, and how greatly they contri∣bute to keep the people in good hu∣mour to support the many charges and losses that are incident to the most successful war.</P>
<P>The fleet when it left Cher∣bourg, was driven to the coast of England; but the troops were not disembarked; it was resolved, that the coast of France should have no respite; and accordingly they sailed towards St. Maloes, and landed in the bay of St. Lunar at a small distance from the town of St. Maloes. This choice of a place for landing, must necessarily have surprised all those who remembered upon what reasons the attempt a∣gainst that place had been so re∣cently laid aside. There was no other object of sufficient conside∣ration near it. The town was at least in as good a posture of de∣fence as it had been then; and the force which was to attack it had since then been considerably lessened. There is undoubtedly something very unaccountable, as well in the choice as in the whole conduct of this affair. The per∣sons in the principal commands, shifted the blame from one to another. There is nothing more remote from our design, than to set up for judges in matters of this nature; or ungenerously to lean on any officer, who meaning well to the service of his country, by some misfortune or mistake fails in such hazardous and intricate enterprises. We shall be satisfied with relating the facts as they hap∣pened.</P>
<P>As soon as the troops were landed in the bay of St. Lunar, it became evident that the design against St. Maloes was utterly im∣practicable. Other projects were then proposed, but they all seemed equally liable to objection. Whilst they debated concerning a plan for their operations, the fleet was in
<PB N="69" REF="81"/>
the greatest danger. The bay of St. Lunar is extremely rocky; and the experience of the people of the country, together with what he saw himself, convinced the Commodore that it was impossible to remain any longer in this road with tolerable safety. Therefore he moved up to the bay of St. Cas, about three leagues to the westward.</P>
<P>The fleet was separated from the land forces; but it was still easy to preserve a communication between them; and as no attack was yet apprehended, they made no scruple to penetrate farther in∣to the country. In two days they arrived at the village of Matig∣non, having had several skirmishes with small bodies of the enemy, who from time to time appeared on their flanks, and who always disappeared when they were briskly encountered. By this time the Duke d'Aiguillon, Governor of Britanny, was advanced within six miles of the English army, with a body of twelve battalions and six squadrons of regular troops, and two regiments of militia. This deter∣mined the council of war to re∣treat; they wanted but three miles to the bay of St. Cas. But in this little march a considerable time was consumed, and the French army was close upon them before they could be completely reim∣barked. A very steep hill formed a sort of amphitheatre about the bay of St. Cas, where the em∣barkation was making; but before the last division, which consisted of all the grenadiers of the army, and the first regiment of guards, could get off, the French had marched down this hill, through an hollow way, and formed them∣selves in a long line against the few English troops that remained. There remained in this exigency only the expedient of assuming a bold coun∣tenance, and attacking them with vigour. The bravery of our troops on this desperate occasion, was wor∣thy of a better fortune. The ships and frigates seconded their efforts, and made a severe fire upon the enemy. All was to no purpose; their ammunition was at last spent; the enemies numbers prevailed; our little body attempted to re∣treat, but they fell into confusion, they broke, an horrible slaughter fol∣lowed, many ran into the water and met their fate in that element. The shore was covered with dead bodies. General Dury was drown∣ed. Sir John Armitage a young vo∣lunteer of great fortune and hopes, was shot through the head. Seve∣ral officers, men of large fortune and consideration, fell. At length the firing of the frigates ceased, and the French immediately gave quarter. About 400 were made prisoners, 600 were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>In the midst of this carnage, in the midst of a fire that stag∣gered the bravest seamen who ma∣naged the boats, Commodore Howe exhibited a noble example of in∣trepidity and fortitude, by order∣ing himself to be rowed in his own boat through the thickest of the fire, to encourage all that were engaged in that service, and to bring off as many men as his vessel could carry.</P>
<P>This affair dispirited the people of England, and elated the people of France far more than an affair of so little consequence ought to have done. It was in fact no more than the cutting off a rear guard. There is often more bloodshed in skirmishes in Germany, which make no figure in the Gazettes. And
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
certainly, if our expeditions to the coast of France were planned with any judgment, on our part we had rather reason to congratulate our∣selves that we were able to land three times on that coast, with so incon∣siderable a loss. The French in∣deed had reason to magnify this loss; and they did greatly magnify it in order to console their people, who had seen their trade suffer so much, and their country so long insulted with impunity.</P>
<P>Whatever our successes were on the coast of France, they did not affect us in the same manner with those which we had in A∣merica. From this part of the world we had long been strangers to any thing, but delays, misfor∣tunes, disappointments, and disgraces. But the spirit which had been roused at home, diffused itself into all parts of the world where we had any concern, and invigorated all our operations.</P>
<P>Admiral Boscawen with a power∣ful fleet of men of war and se∣veral transports sailed for Halifax from England Feb. the 19th. He had the chief command in the ex∣pedition against Louisbourg, and in particular the direction of the na∣val operations. General Amherst, from whose character great things were expected, and who justified these expectations, was to com∣mand the land forces. These a∣mounted to about 14000 men, in∣cluding some light troops, fitted for the peculiar service of the country. The whole fleet consisting of 151 ships, set sail from the harbour of Halifax. On the second of June they appeared before Louisbourg. They were six days on the coast be∣fore a landing was found practicable; such a prodigious surf swelled all along the shore, that no boat could possibly live near it. The French not trusting to this obstacle, had drawn entrenchments in every part where it might be possible to land, supported them with bat∣teries in convenient places, and lined them with numerous in∣fantry. At length the surf though violent, at best, was observed to be somewhat abated, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 8.</NOTE> the Admiral and General did not lose a moment to avail themselves of this first opportunity of land∣ing; they made all their dispo∣sitions for it with the highest judge∣ment. They ordered the frigates towards the enemies right and left, to rake them on their flanks. Then the troops were disposed for landing in three divisions. That on the left was commanded by Ge∣neral Wolfe, and was destined to the real attack. The divisions in the center to the right, were only designed for feigned attacks, to draw the enemies attention to all parts, and to distract their defence.</P>
<P>When the fire of the frigates continued about a quarter of an hour, General Wolfe's division moved towards the land; the enemy reserved their shot until the boats were near in shore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and musquetry upon them. The surf aided their fire. Many of the boats overset, many were broke to pieces, the men jumped into the water, some were killed, some drowned; the rest sup∣ported and encouraged in all diffi∣culties, by the example, spirit, and conduct of their truly gallant com∣mander, gained the shore, took post, fell upon the enemy with such order and resolution, that they soon obliged them to fly in confusion. As soon as this post was made good, the center moved towards
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
the left, and the right followed the center, so that the landing was compleated, though not without much time and trouble, in an ex∣cellent order, and with little loss.</P>
<P>The operations of a siege are too minute and interesting to make a detail of them agreeable to readers, who are not conversant in the art military. The operations a∣gainst Louisbourg for several days went on very slowly, owing en∣tirely to the prodigious surf and the rough weather which made it extremely difficult to land the ar∣tillery, stores, and instruments to be employed in the siege; however, the excellent conduct of the Ge∣nerals Amherst and Wolfe, by de∣grees overcame all the difficulties of the weather, which was ex∣tremely unfavourable, the ground which was rugged in some places and boggy in others, and the re∣sistance of the garrison which was considerable. The French had five men of war of the line in the harbour, who could bring all their guns to bear upon the approaches of the English troops. The first thing done was to secure a point called the light-house battery, from whence they might play upon these vessels, and on the batteries on the other side of the harbour. General Wolfe performed this ser∣vice with his usual vigour and celeri∣ty, and took possession of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">12th.</NOTE> and all the other posts in that quarter. His fire from this post on the 25th silenced the island battery, which was that most immediately opposed to his; but the ships still continued to bear upon him until the 21st of the following month, when one of them blew up, and communicating the fire to two others, they also were in a short time consumed to the water edge. This was a loss not to be repaired; the approaches drew near the covered way, and things were in a good condition for making a lodgement in it; the enemies fire was considerably slackened: the town was consumed to the ground in many places, and the works had suffered much in all. Yet the enemy still delaying to surrender, gave occasion to add one brave action to the others, which had been displayed during the course of this siege. The ad∣miral, who had all along done every thing possible to second the efforts of the land forces, notwith∣standing the severity of the weather, resolved on a stroke, which by being decisive of the possession of the harbour, might make the re∣duction of the town a matter of little difficulty. He resolved to send in a detachment of 600 sea∣men in boats, to take or burn the two ships of the line which remain∣ed, and if he should succeed in this, he proposed the next day to send in some of his own great ships, who might batter the town on the side of the harbour. This was not more wisely planned by the Admiral, than gallantly and successfully executed by Captain Laforey. In spite of the fire from the ships and the batteries, he made himself <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> master of both these ships; one he towed off, the other, as she ran a∣ground, was set on fire.</P>
<P>This stroke, in support of the spi∣rited advances of the land forces, was conclusive The <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26.</NOTE> town surrendered the next day. The garrison were prisoners of war, and amounted with the irregulars and seamen to 5637.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="84"/>
The taking of Louisbourg was an event the most desired by all our colonies; that harbour had always been a receptacle convenient to the enemies privateers, who infested the English trade in North America. It was the most effectual blow which France had received from the commencement of the war. By the taking of Louisbourg, she lost the only place from whence she could carry on the cod fishery; and the only place she had in a convenient situation for the rein∣forcements that were sent to sup∣port the war in the other parts of America; and with Louisbourg fell the island of St. John's, and whatever other inferior stations they had for carrying on the fish∣ery towards Gaspesie and the bay De Chaleurs, which our ships soon after this event entirely destroyed. It is incredible how much this success in America, joined to the spirit of our other measures, ope∣rated to raise our military reputa∣tion in Europe, and to sink that of France, and consequently how much it influenced our most es∣sential interests and those of our allies.</P>
<P>The plan of our operations in America were, however, by no means confined solely to this ob∣ject, important as it was. Two other attempts were proposed: the first attempt was with a great force to drive the French from Ticonde∣roga and Crown Point; in which, if we could succeed, the enemy would lose those posts from which they were in the best condition to molest our colonies, and by losing them, would lay open an easy road into the very heart of their settlements in Canada. The second attempt was to be made with a considerable, though an inferior force, from Pensylvania against Fort du Quesne: The suc∣cess of this attempt would establish us in the possession of the Ohio, and break off the connexion between Canada and Louisiana.</P>
<P>General Abercrombie, command∣er in chief of our forces in America, conducted the first of those expe∣ditions. He embarked upon Lake George with near 16000 troops, regulars and provincials, and a nu∣merous artillery on the 5th of July; and after a prosperous navi∣gation, arrived the next day at the place where it had been proposed to make the landing. They landed without opposition. The enemies advanced guards fled at their ap∣proach. The English army pro∣ceeded in four columns to Ticon∣deroga. As the country through which their march lay is difficult and woody, and the guides which conducted the march to this un∣known country, were extremely unskilful, the troops were bewilder∣ed, the columns broke and fell in upon one another. Whilst they marched on in this alarming dis∣order, the advanced guard of the French, who had lately fled before them, was bewildered in the same manner; and in the same disorder fell in with our forces. A skir∣mish ensued, in which this party was quickly defeated with the loss of near 300 killed and 148 pri∣soners. The loss on the English side was inconsiderable in numbers; but great in consequence. Lord Howe was killed. This gallant man, from the moment he landed in America, had wisely conformed and made his regiment conform to the kind of service which the country required. He did not suf∣fer any under him to encumber themselves with superfluous bag∣gage;
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
he himself set the example, and fared like a common soldier. The first to encounter danger, to endure hunger, to support fatigue; rigid in his discipline, but easy in his manners, his officers and sol∣diers readily obeyed the com∣mander, because they loved the man; and now at the moment when such abilities, and such an example were the most wanted, was fatally lost a life which was long enough for his honour but not for his country. It adds indeed to the glory of such a death, and to the consolation of his country, that we still possess the heir of his titles, his fortunes, and his virtues, whilst we tremble to see the same vir∣tues exposing themselves to the same dangers. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Soon after the news of Lord Howe's death arrived, the following advertisement ap∣peared in the public papers; an application worthy of a Roman matron, in the virtuous times of the republic, and which could not fail of success, where the least spark of virtue existed:</P>
<P><Q>“To the gentlemen, clergy, freeholders, and burgesses, of the town and county of the” town of Nottingham.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As Lord Howe is now absent upon the public service, and Lieutenant Colonel Howe is with his regiment at Louisbourg. It rests upon me to beg the favour of your votes and interests, that Lieutenant Colonel Howe may supply the place of his late brother, as” your representative in parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Permit me therefore to implore the protection of every one of you, as the mother of” him, whose life has been lost in the service of his country.</Q> Albemarle Street, Sept. 14. 1758.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Excepting this loss, the army had hitherto proceeded successfully. In a little time they appeared before Ticonderoga. This is a ve∣ry <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 8.</NOTE> important post, and as strongly secured. The fort is situ∣ated on a tongue of land between Lake George and a narrow gut, which communicates with the Lake Champlain. On three sides it is surrounded with water; and for a good part of the fourth it has a dangerous morass in front; where that failed, the French had made a very strong line upwards of eight feet high, defended by cannon, and secured by 4 or 5000 men. A great fall of trees with their branches outward, was spread before the entrenchment for about an hundred yards.</P>
<P>The General caused the ground to be reconnoitred; and the en∣gineer made so favourable a report of the weakness of the retrench∣ment, that it appeared practicable to force it by musquetry alone. A fatal resolution was taken, in consequence of this report, not to wait the arrival of the artillery, which on account of the badness of the ground, could not be easily brought up, but to attack the enemy without loss of time. They were confirmed in this precipitate resolution, by a rumour that a body of 3000 men were on their march to join the French at Ticonderoga, and very shortly expected to arrive.</P>
<P>When the attack began, the difficulty of the ground and the strength of the enemies lines which had been so little foreseen, was but too severely felt. Although the troops behaved with the utmost spirit and gallantry, they suf∣fered so terribly in their approaches, and made so little impression on the entrenchment, that the Gene∣ral seeing their reiterated and ob∣stinate efforts fail of success, being
<PB N="74" REF="86"/>
upwards of four hours exposed to a most terrible fire, thought it necessary to order a retreat, to save the remains of the army. Near 2000 of our men were killed, wounded and taken prisoners; the number of the taken being very inconsiderable. This precipitat eat∣tack, was followed by a retreat as precipitate; insomuch that our army gained their former camp to the southward of Lake <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> George, the evening after the action.</P>
<P>To repair the misfortune of this bloody defeat, General Aber∣crombie detached Colonel Brad∣street with about 3000 provincials against Fort Frontenac. The Co∣lonel with great prudence and vigour, surmounting great diffi∣culties, brought his army to Os∣wego, where he embarked on the Lake Ontario, and arrived at Frontenac the 25th of August. This fort stands at the commu∣nication of Lake Ontario with the river St. Lawrence, the entrance into which river it in some manner commands. However, for a post of such moment, it was poorly fortified, and poorly garrisoned. It was taken without the loss of a man on our side, in less <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27.</NOTE> than two days after it had been attacked. The garrison con∣sisting of 130 men were made pri∣soners; nine armed sloops were taken and burned; and a large quantity of provisions amassed there for the use of their garrisons to the southward, was destroyed. The Fort was demolished. Colonel Bradstreet having performed this important service, returned. Many were of opinion, that so fine a post ought to have been kept and strongly garrisoned; others thought that it would be impossible to pre∣serve a place at such a distance from our own establishments.</P>
<P>It is very possible, that the suc∣cess of Colonel Bradstreet greatly facilitated that of the expedition under General Forbes. The Ge∣neral had had a very tedious and troublesome march, through a coun∣try almost impracticable, very little known, and continually harassed on his route by the enemies In∣dians. An advanced guard of this army, consisting of about 800 men under Major Grant, had most unaccountably advanced close to Fort du Quesne, with a design as it should seem of reduc∣ing the place by a <HI>coup de main;</HI> but the garrison suddenly sallying out and attacking them warmly on all sides, killed and made pri∣soners many of this party, and dispersed the rest. This was how∣ever their last success; for the body of the army being conducted with greater skill and circumspec∣tion, baffled all their attempts; so that the French being convinc∣ed by several skirmishes that all their efforts to surprize the troops, or interrupt their communication were to no purpose, and being conscious that their fort was not tenable against a regular attack, they wisely abandoned the place after destroying their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24.</NOTE> works; and fell down the Ohio, to the number of 4 or 500 men, towards their more southern settle∣ments. General Forbes once more erected the English flag on Fort du Quesne. Without <NOTE PLACE="marg">25th.</NOTE> any resistance we became masters in the third year after the com∣mencement of hostilities of that fortress, the contention for which had kindled up the flames of so general and destructive a war. This place with its masters has changed
<PB N="75" REF="87"/>
its name, and is called Pittsburg, with a propriety which does not need to be pointed out.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the unhappy affair at Ticonderoga, the cam∣paign of 1758 in America was very advantageous, and very ho∣nourable to the English interest. Louisbourg, St. John's, Frontenac, and du Quesne reduced, remove from our colonies all terror of the Indian incursions, draw from the French those useful allies, free our frontiers from the yoke of their enemies forts, make their supplies difficult, their communications pre∣carious, and all their defensive or offensive operations uneffective; whilst their country uncovered of its principal bulwarks, lies open to the heart, and affords the most plea∣sing prospects of success to the vigo∣rous measures which we may be as∣sured will be taken in the next cam∣paign. General Amherst is now commander.</P>
<P>It would be doing great inju∣stice to the spirit and conduct of the ministry, not to observe, that they omitted to distress the enemy in no part, and that their plans of operation were as extensive as they were vigorous.</P>
<P>Two ships of the line with some frigates, were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9.</NOTE> sent early in the spring to the coast of Africa, to drive the French from their settlements there. They en∣tered the river Senegal, and in spite of the obstruction of a dan∣gerous bar, which the ships of war could not pass, they obliged the French fort <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE> which commands the river to sur∣render. And on the 29th of De∣cember following, Commodore Kep∣pel, with the assistance of some troops under the command of Lieu∣tenant-Colonel Worge, made him∣self master of the island of Goree and its forts; the garrison surren∣dering at discretion to his Majesty's squadron. By these successes, we have taken from the enemy one of the most valuable branches of their commerce, and one of the most capable of abundant improve∣ment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The river Senga, or Senegal, is one of those channels of the river Niger, by which it is supposed to discharge its waters into the Atlantic ocean: The river Niger, according to the best maps, rises in the east of Africa; and after a course of 300 miles, nearly due west, divides into three branches, the most northerly of which is the Senegal, as above; the middle is the Gambia, or Gambra; and the most southern Rio Grande. Senegal empties itself into the Atlantic ocean in 16° north lat. The entrance of it is guarded by several forts, the principal of which is Fort Lewis, built on an island of the same name. It is a quadrangular fort, with two bastions, and of no inconsiderable strength. At the mouth of the river is a bar; the best season for passing it, is from March to August, or September, or rather from April to July, because the tides are then highest. The English had formerly settlements here, out of which they were driven by the French, who have engrossed the whole trade from Cape Blanco to the river Gambia, which is near 500 miles. The Dutch were the first who settled Senegal, and built two forts. The French made themselves masters of them in 1678. In 1692 the English seized them; but next year the French retook them, and have kept them ever since. They built Fort Lewis in 1692, and have beyond it a multitude of other settlements, extending 200 leagues up the river. The principal commodities which the French import from this settlement are, that valu∣able article gum senega, hides, bees-wax, elephants teeth, cotton, gold dust, negro slaves, ostrich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.</P>
<P>At present we are obliged to buy all our gum senega of the Dutch, who purchase it from the French; and they set what price they please on it. But as the trade to Africa is now open, by this important acquisition, the price of this valuable drug, which is so much used in several of our manufactures, will be much reduced.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="88"/>
From the East Indies we have this year heard nothing remarkable. It does not seem that the French, notwithstanding the great struggle they made to send out a strong ar∣mament under General Lally, have been in a condition to enterprise any thing. It is said, and proba∣bly with good foundation, that the greatest part of that force was dwindled away with sickness during the voyage. Our naval force was exerted with spirit and effect in the Mediterreanean. The French found that the possession of Mi∣norca could not drive us from the dominion of the Mediterranean, where Admiral Osborn gave the enemies maritime strength such blows, as they must long feel, and which merited him the greatest of all honours, to be joined with the conquerors of Louisbourg, in the thanks of the representative body of their country.</P>
<P>The coming year seems big with great events. In Germany the af∣fairs of the rival powers of Prussia and Austria, appear to be more nearly ballanced than at any time since the beginning of the war. Their force is as great as ever, and their animosity is no way les∣sened. Great steps are taken to as∣semble powerful armies on the Rhine; whilst Great Britain has sent out two considerable armaments, one to the West Indies, the other to A∣frica; the success of which must go a great way towards determining the issue of the war. Other great preparations are also making on the part of Great Britain. In the mean time, the Dutch enraged at the captures of their ships, make com∣plaints, and threaten armaments. The death of the Princess of O∣range, which happened at a most critical juncture, adds more per∣plexity to affairs in that quarter. If we look to the southward, the clouds seem gathering there also. The imminent death of the King of Spain, will be an event fruitful of troubles. In this affair the King of Sardinia, the house of Austria, and the house of Bourbon, will find themselves concerned; to say nothing of the maritime powers. In a word, the flame of war threatens to spread in every part of Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The inclinations of the powers at war at the closing the last campaign. The King of Spain's death apprehended. Condition of the King of Prussia, Empress Queen, Russia, Sweden, Holland, France, and England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER reflects up∣on the conclusion of the several campaigns since the year 1755, will easily perceive that at the end of the last, the fortune of the several powers at war seem∣ed more nearly upon a ballance, than it had been at the close of any of the former. That campaign was rather less bloody, than that which immediately preceded it; and it was not concluded with any action of such an eclat, as could greatly raise, or depress the hopes of any of the contending parties. All par∣ties became more cautious; because it became every day more evident, that the fortune of war was not to be decided by any single stroke, however considerable. The prize was reserved for the player of the skilful game; for the most attentive patience: for the greatest depth of resources. An equality of this kind seemed at last to promise Eu∣rope some repose. All sides might now give and receive honourable and equitable terms; and peace
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
might be settled on that footing, on which it has been usually made, for some time past, in our part of the world. But the great designs entertained by each power; re∣venge imbittered by the blows which all had felt in their turns, the consideration of the vast ex∣pences that fell upon all, and which a peace at that time would have made fruitless; even the hopes a∣rising from the equivocal appear∣ances of the last campaign, estranged every court from the disposition to peace. Insomuch that there were no terms directly offered by any of the belligerent powers; nor did any of the neutral interpose their mediation. Besides these, another cause operated powerfully; a great event was hourly expected about this time; an event which threatned to involve the Southern parts of Europe in the calamities of that war, that had so long wasted the Northern; and which, whenever it should take place, threatned to render the politi∣cal system infinitely more intricate, and probably to give the war quite a new turn.</P>
<P>The late King of Spain, by the force of a conjugal affection, rarely seen in that dignity, since the death of his Queen had been given up to a melancholy, which preyed upon his health and affected his understand∣ing. His death, or incapacity, ap∣peated inevitable within a short time. The King of Naples, Don Carlos, was next in the order of succession. In the treaty of Aix la Chapelle. it had been agreed, that the dutchies of Parma. Placentia and Guastalla, should be restored to the house of Austria, in case Don Carlos should ever come to the crown of Spain. These countries were at the end of that war, in the hands of the Empress Queen, or her allies. Her imperial Majesty had set up a claim to the re∣version of these dutchies, on the extinction of issue male in the house of Farnese. But the ambition of the Queen of Spain to make all her children Sovereigns, put powerful bars in her way to it. This ambi∣tion was one of the causes which made the last so general a war. The peace of Aix la Chapelle, which put a period to that war, after settling these contested dutchies as an esta∣blishment for Don Philip second son to the King of Spain, provided, that whenever the event, which we have mentioned above, should take place, that is to say, the accession of Don Carlos to the crown of Spain, then the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily should pass to the In∣fant Don Philip, and the dutchies which formed his establishment should revert to the house of Austria.</P>
<P>The King of Naples, not with∣out reason, looked upon this article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, as injurious to his rights; accordingly he never acceded to it. No method in this case could be seen, which might prevent matters from com∣ing to extremities, except the situa∣tion of the Empress, engaged as she was with a powerful adversary, who kept her forces strained to their utmost pitch. She was in no condition to engage in a new war, however interesting the object might be. Her ally France, who so inef∣fectually assisted her in Germany, could not probably assist her with more effect in Italy; she therefore seemed to have no other part left, than to acquiesce for the present, and wait in silence a more favoura∣ble opportunity to assert her claims. The event of the King of Spain's death has since happened. It has
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
produced none of those immediate effects which were apprehended; and this probably proceeded from the cause which we have just now hinted. A dead calm at present broods over Italy. But in this tranquillity and silence there are materials gathering, which may on no very distant period burst in a terrible tempest over that delight∣ful country. They are very near∣ly the same that produced the last troubles there, and may not only revive them, but spread the horrors of war once more over all Europe.</P>
<P>Such were the inclinations of the powers at war at the opening of this year; their strength seemed also very entire; in particular, the resources of the King of Prussia ap∣peared astonishing, after the great blows he had suffered; and after the advantages he had gained, but gained at so high a price. He was still able to shew himself the father and benefactor, as well as the pro∣tector of his people. In the midst of the devouring waste of such an expensive war, from the funds of his oeconomy he was enabled to remit the taxes to those parts of his dominions, which had suffer∣ed from the Russian barbarity; he even advanced money to those which had suffered the most consi∣derably.</P>
<P>To take a nearer view of his situation, we must observe, that the whole kingdom of Prussia still re∣mained in the hands of the Mus∣covites. The dutchy of Cleves, together with his other possessions on the Rhine, could yield him nothing; they were held by the French; but in these respects, his situation was not worse than it had been, almost from the beginning of the war. He had to ballance these losses, the rich country of Saxony, which he had twice in one campaign wrested from the hands of the Austrians. Add to this, the renewal of the subsidy treaty with Great Britain, on the advantageous terms of the former year. These were undoubtedly great supports; and the King seemed as entire in power, and more advanced in repu∣tation than ever.</P>
<P>But to a more critical examina∣tion, things had an aspect not quite so favourable. This appearance was rather specious than entirely solid; and whilst all without looked full and fair, within there was a decay of substance, and an hol∣lowness that rung at the slightest touch. That incomparable body of troops, which at the beginning of the war had given him so great a superiority, no longer existed in the same persons. If his troops derived advantages from a long series of ac∣tive service, these advantages were equally on the side of the enemy. His army had known what it is to be beaten; and it is no wonder, if a sort of weariness and despair be∣gan to creep upon them, after such an infinite train of unrewarded fa∣tigues, when they saw that so many wonderful exploits had not yet end∣ed the war in their favour. Many of his best generals had been killed in battle, or died, or had retired, or were disgraced. The hoards which he had amassed before the war, by this time must have been entirely spent; his dominions must have been greatly exhausted, both of men and money. Saxony could no longer yield such supplies, as formerly. The indigence of the subdued inhabitants, set bounds to the rapacity of the conqueror. The subsidy of Great Britain did a great deal; but it could not sup∣ply the deficiencies on this, and on
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
every other side. These circum∣stances, probably, made the King of Prussia more cautious and dilatory than usual.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna had as great burthens to sustain as the King of Prussia, and she had suffer∣ed much greater blows. That pow∣er has a strength, somewhat unac∣countable and peculiar to herself. More deficient in pecuniary funds, than any other great power in Eu∣rope, she is better able to subsist, and to do considerable things with∣out them. For by a long habit, the whole state is formed to its ne∣cessities; and the subject is more ready to supply free quarter, and to endure military licence than any other. The country is abundantly fruitful in all its parts. And whilst the war is carried on near home, an arbitrary government, operating on so extensive an object, can hardly fail of such resources, as must serve an Austrian army; which is still paid, in a great measure, as Tacitus describes the troops of the ancient Germans to have been; <HI>they have a plentiful table in lieu of pay.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nam epulae, et quanquam incompti, largi tamen apparatus pro stipendio cedunt.</HI> Tacit. de moribus Germ. §. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And indeed it must be owned, that there is no Sovereign, who is more highly honoured in his domi∣nions, or obeyed with a greater mixture of love and reverence, by all his subjects, than her Imperial Majesty. So that having a very am∣ple power, very willing obedience, a large territory and many men, not sufficiently employed in the arts of peace, it perhaps may be gues∣sed, in what manner she has been able to supply her many and great losses, and to continue a war, like the present, better than states more abundant in money. She is besides, and this is a matter of no small con∣sequence, supported by the coun∣tenance, the authority, and the forces of the Empire. And she has for her allies the first, and most formidable names in Euorpe. In the wars which this power carried on in the last, and in this century, though usually not very successful, she has always been the last to de∣sire a peace; though frequently slow in her operations, she makes amends by an extraordinary per∣severance.</P>
<P>This slowness could not escape general observation, in the actions of the last year. That the Austrians did not play with sufficient spirit, the great game which was in their hands, after the battle of Hohkir∣chen and the entry of the Russians into the New Marche of Branden∣burgh, seems hardly disputable. Per∣haps it was that the court of Vienna, by an error common to many courts, but particularly so to this, and often fatal to it, interfered too much and too minutely, in the operations of the campaign.</P>
<P>It is not impossible that the cha∣racter of Marshal Dawn himself, might have had some share in this inactivity; a character almost in all things the direct reverse of that of his Prussian Majesty. He saw that the King, active, resolute and ad∣venturous, wasted himself even by that activity and spirit, to which he owed his most brilliant successes. Should the Austrians carry on the war in the same spirit, they might suffer in the same manner, without being ever able to equal, much less to exceed that great Monarch, in a stile of action peculiarly his own. Daun therefore by principle, seems to have kept his army from coming to action, in order to oppose a strength entire, and recruited by a long rest, to that of the King of Prussia, wasted by the efforts it was obliged to make, incessantly and on
<PB N="81" REF="93"/>
every side. His design seemed to be, that the issue of the war should rather arise from the general result and concurrence of all the opera∣tions, gradually producing a solid though a slow advantage, than from the effect of a bold, quick, and masterly stroke. In fact, the Aus∣trians felt all the benefits, and all the inconveniencies which usually attend this sort of conduct, a con∣duct which probably lost them Sax∣ony in the last campaign, and which has secured them the possession of what they now hold in that country. The Austrians and Prussians watched the time and one another, and came very late to action.</P>
<P>The court of Petersburg still ad∣hered to its old system, in spite of the late ill success of her arms, and all the efforts of the British minis∣ter, to withdraw her from her al∣liance. If she had some loss of men, it was the least loss she could feel: and she thought that whilst the war was carried on at the expence of o∣thers, the reduction of so near, so dreaded, and so hated a rival as the King of Prussia, and the opportu∣nity of the forming her troops to service, and perfecting her officers, were objects of consequence enough to keep her closely attached to her first sentiments.</P>
<P>The Swedes preserved likewise the same connexion; but they continued as before, an inconsiderable, and in∣glorious part of the war.</P>
<P>Holland preserved her neutrali∣ty; but it was a neutrality little respected, and indeed in itself lit∣tle respectable. Divided in her councils, attentive only to private interests, she disgusted the English, and neither pleased nor served the French. For some of the subjects of that republic had carried on the trade of France in their bottoms, which subjected them to frequent captures from the English men of war and privateers. This produced loud complaints in Holland, and warm remonstrances to the court of London. These complaints met with little attention, being in many respects but indifferently founded. The affair was drawn out in length, until the dispute was ex∣tinguished by the destruction of its object; some of the French colonies were reduced, and the trade in the others, grown too small and too ha∣zardous to be continued longer with any hope of advantage.</P>
<P>The affairs of France and Eng∣land were partly connected with the general system, and partly di∣stinct and independent. France perceived that the strength of the English, and the exertion of that strength, increased continually in America; she knew from the na∣tural inferiority of her colonies, and the feeble state of her navy, that she could not in reason hope for great success in that quarter; for which reason, although she sent a fleet under Mons. Bompart into the West Indies, and some men of war, with as many store and transport ships as she could steal out of the river St. Lawrence, her great efforts were to be made in Europe; she had two objects, the recovery of Hanover, and the invasion of these islands; in either of which if she succeeded, there could be no doubt, but that it would prove a sufficient ballance for all that she had suffered, or had to apprehend in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>With regard to the first object, though it was difficult to attain it, and though if it should be attained, it did not promise to answer her purposes so well as the latter, yet it was upon that she chiefly depended.
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
Hitherto indeed the success which France had in Germany, was not at all proportioned to the prodigious efforts which she made; she began to find herself much exhausted. The wants of the French obliged them to pay little respect to neutral, or even to friendly powers; so that the esteem and assistance which they had in Germany, diminished con∣tinually. They eat up the country, and seized on such towns as were convenient to them, without any cere∣mony: yet freed from all these re∣straints, their army had made very little progress; their generals had not displayed any great abilities, and their army, in itself very badly composed, was deficient in discipline, to a degree which is scarcely credible. They kept neither guards nor posts, nor centinels; a great part of their troops wandered from the camp into the neighbouring towns, and returned drunk. Their councils of war were held in a tu∣multuous and disorderly manner; and all their designs were perfectly known in the camp of the allies, where a very different picture was exhibited, with regard to regularity and caution.</P>
<P>The French troops have several essential defects in their constitution, which prevent them from equalling those of Germany, and other nations. Several regiments are in a manner he∣reditary in great families, who placed at their first outset at a very high point of military rank, think it un∣necessary to attain the qualifications, which lead others to it step by step. As to the rest of the officers, as their pay is small and their hopes little, few study the art military, as a pro∣fession: they serve because it is the fashion to do so, and that it is thought necessary to a gentleman. Thus they dispatch their business as a dis∣agreeable task; and having little to lose in the service, it is almost im∣possible to preserve a due subordina∣tion. The common men are little more than abject vassals, and there∣fore want that high spirit which in their gentry makes some amends for the want of knowledge and assi∣duity. And as they are corrupted by the example of their superiors, so by their negligence they are left without any restraint. The officers do not chuse to incur the ill will of their men, or to give themselves trouble, by exercising that wholsome severity in which the health and vi∣gour of military discipline consists.</P>
<P>The German common people are indeed in a still lower state of vassal∣age than the French, and might therefore be supposed naturally, no better soldiers; but their bodies are more robust and hardy; their treat∣ment is severe and rigorous, their subordination is most exact, which makes their discipline perfect; and Germany is so habituated to war, that all the people may be said to be born soldiers. These things give the Germans a great superiority over the French; a superiority which was more visible in this, than in any for∣mer war.</P>
<P>These defects in their army were increased by the low state of their finances, which caused their troops to be very ill paid. The French court made some attempts to keep up their credit, by changing their former methods of raising money. Mr. Silhoute was made comptroller of the finances, and the farmers general were removed from their former employment of finding the supplies. New methods were devised, which might stave off the entire ruin of their finances, until their armies in Germany could strike some effec∣tive blow, or their project of an in∣vasion, which quieted the minds of
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
the people in some degree, should be put in execution.</P>
<P>With regard to the latter project, France had formerly found that the bare report of such a design had served many material purposes; but in England things had since then, been greatly changed. The threats of an invasion increased our internal strength, without raising any apprehensions; they in a great measure executed the militia act, which hardly any thing else could have put in execution; they in∣creased the regular troops, both in their number and their species. England for the first time saw light horse and light foot. There reign∣ed in both houses the most per∣fect and unprecedented union. A∣mong the great men there was no difference that could in the least af∣fect the conduct of the war. The dispute concerning the preference of the continental and the marine system, was entirely silenced; be∣cause a system took place which comprehended both, and operated in both as fully as the warmest ad∣vocates of either could desire. Ne∣ver did England keep a greater number of land forces on foot, on the continent of Europe, in Eng∣land, in America, when she turned all her power to her land forces on∣ly. Never did she cover the seas with such formidable fleets, when her navy alone engaged her atten∣tion. Such is the effect when pow∣er and patriotism unite; when <HI>li∣berty and order kiss;</HI> and when a nation sits with a happy security un∣der the shade of abilities which she has tried, and virtues in which she dares to conside.</P>

General Wobersnow's expedition into Poland. Prince Henry's into Bohemia and Franconia. General Macguire defeated. Bamberg pil∣laged. Prince Henry returns to Saxony. Hesse abandoned by the allies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE seizing of Francfort in the last year, by a most fla∣grant violation of the liberties of the Empire, had given the French and their allies the most material ad∣vantage they had acquired in the campaign; for it secured to them the course of the Maine, and the Rhine, and made it easy to them to receive every kind of reinforcement and supply. It secured likewise that communication between them, the Imperial, and the Austrian armies, and formed that chain, from which they derived no small benefit of mutual succour and concurrence in their operations. Much depended upon their being dislodged from that post; as well with regard to the fortune of his Britannic Majesty's army, as to that of the King of Prussia. Such a stroke must neces∣sarily have the greatest influence on the events of the whole ensuing campaign. Prince Ferdinand, sen∣sible of this, as soon as the season permitted him to enter upon action, drew his troops out of their canton∣ments; and at the head of thirty thousand men, prepared to dislodge them, before they could receive the supplies, of which they were in daily expectation. The rest of his army, consisting of about ten or twelve thousand men, were left to guard the electorate, and to watch the bishoprick of Munster. Some detachments of Hanoverians and Prussians had, in the latter end of February, driven the Imperialists
<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
and Austrians from the posts, which they occupied at Erfurth and Eisi∣nach, and some places in the coun∣try of Hesse; this drew a strong body of the enemy into that part, which pushed them back; but the hereditary Prince of Brunswick, who led the army of the allies through ways, before deemed im∣passable to an army, defeated them in some severe skirmishes; several places of importance were taken; several' whole battalions were made prisoners, with their officers. The French, alarmed at the vivacity of this beginning, judged it but the prelude to something more decisive. Accordingly the Duke of Broglio took an advantageous post, near Bergen, at a village between Franc∣fort and Hannau, which it was necessary that the allies should mas∣ter, before they could penetrate to his line. This place he had made his right, and secured his flanks and center in such a manner, that the attack could only be made at that village.</P>
<P>In this disposition was the French army when the allies approached; they formed themselves under an emi∣nence, and began the attack on the vil∣lage of Bergen, between nine and ten in the morning with great intrepidity. They were received with a very se∣vere fire, which the enemy had pre∣pared for them; they made three at∣tacks in the space of about two hours, and were every time repulsed.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand now observed that the enemy still kept a good countenance in their post, and that his own troops began to fall into some disorder. This able general, who never risques his fortune on a single throw, began to think of a retreat, whilst his loss was yet in∣considerable, and the disorder of his men easily to be repaired. But a retreat in the face of a victorious enemy, was hazardous; and the day was not yet above half spent. In this exigence he made such movements, as strongly indicated a design of falling once more upon the village, in the enemy's right, and of making at the same time a new attack upon their left. These appearances were farther counte∣nanced by a cannonade, on both these posts, supported with an un∣common fury. The French, de∣ceived by these manoeuvres, kept close in their posts; they expected a new and a lively attack every moment; they returned the can∣nonade as briskly as they could; and in this posture things continu∣ed until night came on, when the Prince made an easy retreat, with∣out disorder, or molestation, and halted at Windeken.</P>
<P>In this action the loss of the allies was about two thousand in every way; that of the French was by no means less considerable. The allies indeed suffered nothing in their reputation; their countenance through the whole action having been excellent. Prince Ferdinand gained as much honour, and dis∣played as much skill, as could have been obtained, or shewn upon a more fortunate occasion. The event however was, in its consequences, far from indifferent; for the allies having missed this blow, the French still kept Francfort, and all advan∣tages which they drew from that situation; they had time and means to receive their reinforcements; and they acquired in a short space such a superiority, as obliged Prince Fer∣dinand to content himself with act∣ing on the defensive, for a long time after.</P>
<P>The advantages which would have
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
a risen from another issue of that bat∣tle appeared more fully, from the operations which were carrying on on the side of Bohemia, and which probably were designed to concur with those of the Prince, in some grand and comprehensive scheme. There is no doubt, that the army of the allies, and those of his Prus∣sian Majesty, had determined to act in concert, and had settled some plan for that purpose: and though it should not be discovered with equal certainty, what that plan was, it may not however be unpleasant to trace it; as far at least, as a reasonable conjecture, guided by the lights de∣rived from the tendency of each ope∣ration, may lead us. For if we suc∣ceed at all, in such an attempt, it diffuses a wonderful clearness over the whole narrative.</P>
<P>It is not impossible then, that it was designed in the first place, to keep the Russians at a distance, un∣til the latter end of the summer, by the destruction of their magazines in Poland. That on the other side Prince Ferdinand should attempt to drive the French towards the Rhine, and to get between them and the army of the empire; which having thus lost its communication with the French, Prince Henry should rush out of Saxony, and fall upon them in Bohemia and Franconia, and cut off also their communication with the great body of the Austrians. Then the Imperialists would find themselves situated between two hostile and superior armies; whilst in Bohemia, Marshal Daun would be either obliged to try his fortune single handed, with the King of Prussia, or totally to abandon that kingdom, into which it was in the power of the Prussians to enter, in opposite parts at once.</P>
<P>The first part of this plan was executed with great spirit and suc∣cess. So early as the 23rd of Fe∣bruary the Prussian general Wo∣bersnow marched into Poland, from Glogau in Silesia, with forty-six squadrons, and twenty-nine batta∣lions, where they routed some bo∣dies of Cossacks; and after having destroyed several immense maga∣zines, particularly one at Posen, said to be sufficient for the sub∣sistence of fifty thousand men for three months, they returned without any loss into Silesia, on the 18th of April.</P>
<P>As for the second Act of this mi∣litary drama, it was executed with as great success, and with some ad∣vantages more striking than the first. Prince Henry commanded the Prus∣sian troops in Saxony, which the public accounts called forty thou∣sand men. He had certain intelli∣gence, that some movements, which had purposely been made by the King of Prussia, had drawn the greatest part of the Austrian troops, which had been posted as a watch upon Saxony, towards the frontiers of Silesia. He immediately took ad∣vantage of this opening, and entered Bohemia in two columns: one marched towards Peters∣wade; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 15.</NOTE> the other, which was com∣manded by General Hulsen, made its way by Pasberg and Commot∣tau. The first penetrated as far as Loboschutz and Leitmeritz, the en∣emy flying before them, and every where abandoning or burning the vast magazines which they had a∣massed in all those parts.</P>
<P>The body under General Hulsen did as much service, and it had a more active employment. The pass of Pasberg, strong in it self, was defended by a considerable body of Austrians. General Hulsen having conducted his cavalry by ano∣ther way, so as to fall directly on their
<PB N="86" REF="98"/>
rear attacked them with his infan∣try in front, and drove them out of all their intrenchments; one gene∣ral, fifty one officers, and no less than two thousand private men, were made prisoners on this occa∣sion. The Prussians lost but seventy men killed and wounded. They re∣turned into Saxony with hostages for the contributi∣ons <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap 22.</NOTE> they had exacted.</P>
<P>After this fatiguing expedition, the Prince gave his troops a few days to rest, and then led them once more to action. He directed his march through the Voigtland, towards the army of the Empire; they entered Franconia by the way of Hoff; they attacked General Macguire, who commanded a body of Austrians and Imperialists. Here they were bravely resisted for the whole day; but the numbers and spirit of the Prussians prevailing, Macguire gladly took advantage of the night to make a retreat, having lost about five hundred men. A few skirmishes more decided the fate of Franconia. The army of the Em∣pire retreated, as the Prussians ad∣vanced, and abandoned the rich bishoprics of Bamberg and Wurtz∣burg to contribution. The town of Bamberg surrender∣ed upon terms; but <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 16.</NOTE> some confusion happening before the capitulation was compleatly finished, a party of Croats came to blows with a party of Prussians, who had by this time possession of one of the gates; this was resented as an infringement of the capitulation. A pretence was given to plunder the place; it was given up to pillage, by order of the commanders, for two days, in a very unrelenting and licentious manner. This produced loud and just complaints against the Prussians, and in due time a severe retaliation.</P>
<P>Prince Henry had pushed back the army of the Empire, as far as Nuremberg; he had disabled a great part of the circle of Fran∣conia from giving them assistance; and thus far he had accomplished the objects of his expedition. But as that part of the plan, which Prince Ferdinand was to have ex∣ecuted, had failed, it was impos∣sible on one hand to hinder the French army from succouring that of the Empire, or on the other, to prevent a body of Austrians from availing themselves of his absence, to penetrate into Saxony. In these circumstances any farther stay in Franconia was useless, and might be dangerous. His army, loaded with booty and contribution, re∣turned to their old situation. The Austrians retired into Bohemia at their approach.</P>
<P>Appearances were hitherto favour∣able enough to the Prussians; how∣ever none of the great ends propo∣sed by the general plan were fully answered. The Russians, notwith∣standing the destruction of their ma∣gazines, continued their march to∣wards Silesia. Count Dohna, who had raised great contributions and levies in the dutchy of Mecklenburg, was preparing to oppose them on the side of Brandenburgh; other parties under other commanders, were post∣ed at those places where their irrup∣tion was the most apprehended. The approach of this army brought things nearer and nearer to a crisis. The eyes of all Europe were fixed with anxiety and expectation on their progress. It appeared the more formidable, because the pro∣gress of the French arms was very rapid after the battle of Bergen.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand finding that another attack was not adviseable, retreated continually. The French
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
possessed themselves of Hesse with∣out opposition; they met as little in making their way through the bishopric of Paderborn; and whilst their grand army, under Marshal de Contades, pushed the allies in that quarter and on the side of Hesse, M. d'Armentieres was posted by We∣sel, to advance on that side as oc∣casion should require. The condi∣tion of the allied army was ex∣tremely dubious; whilst the French increased in their numbers and spi∣rit. Their new success gave them reason to hope for a campaign as for∣tunate as that of 1757.</P>

<P>GREAT Britain was not con∣tent with the efforts which she had made in Germany: America, the interests of which had given rise to the war, was the object which principally engaged her attention. This was indeed the proper object of her natural strength, and by her suc∣cess in this quarter, she most effectu∣ally laid the ax to the root of the enemy's naval power, and cut away one great part of the resources which fed the war. A squadron of nine ships of the line, with sixty trans∣ports, containing six regiments <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1758.</NOTE> of foot, in the end of the last year, sailed for the West Indies, in or∣der to attack and reduce the French Caribbee islands. General Hopson commanded the land forces; the fleet in the expedition was to be under the orders of Commodore Moore, then in the West Indies.</P>
<P>Their first object was Martinico, the first in reputation of the French Caribbees, the seat of government, the center of all the trade which France carries on with those islands; strong both by nature and art. This island lies in the 15th degree N. lat. The shore is on every side indented with very deep bays, which they call Cul de Sacs, and the sands, only dis∣coverable at low water, form in ma∣ny places a hidden, and almost in∣surmountable barrier. A lofty ridge of almost impassable mountains, runs north west and south east quite through the island; all the space on both sides is intersected at inconsi∣derable distances with deep gullies, through which the water pours down in the rainy seasons, with great impetuosity. In other re∣spects, the island is pleasant and fruitful; well watered, and well cul∣tivated, abounding with plantations and villages all along the sea coast. The two principal places are St. Pierre, and Port Royal; both towns considerable in this part of the world, for their magnitude, trade and strength.</P>
<P>By this short description may be discerned, how desirable such a conquest was, and the difficulties which naturally opposed themselves to it. They were the greater, because at this time there was in the island a considerable number of regular troops. They have at all times a numerous and well armed militia, not contemp∣tible for their discipline, and
<PB N="88" REF="100"/>
well suited to the service of the country; add to this, that they can bring into the field a large body of negroes, habituated to arms, and in general well affected to the interests of their masters.</P>
<P>The English forces landed with∣out opposition, on the west side of Port Royal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6.</NOTE> harbour, after the men of war had driven the enemy from their bat∣teries and entrenchments. But on their landing, they found that the nature of the country proved a greater obstruction to their progress, than the strength of the enemy. These profound gullies, inclosed by steep, and almost perpendicular precipices, proved an unsurmount∣able obstacle to the regular march of the troops, or the conveyance of cannon. The enemy had broken up the roads; and five miles of such roads, and through such an im∣practicable country, were to be pas∣sed, before Port Royal could be at∣tacked by land. The commander, therefore, of the forces, judged the difficulties on the land-side insur∣mountable; the naval commander held it impossible to put the cannon ashore nearer to the sort. Some jea∣lousy seems to have arisen. The re∣sult of the whole was, that the forces were reimbarked on the day of their landing.</P>
<P>Very little was done at Port Roy∣al; but it was hoped, that more would be done at St. Pierre. They accordingly set sail for that place; but when they had arrived before it, and examined the coast, new difficulties arose, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> produced a new deliberation. They determined that the fort could not be reduced, without such detriment to the troops and the shipping, that they could afterwards make little use of their success; and in this they had probably good reason. The conduct of the officers afterwards plainly demonstrated, that no mean views had any influence on their councils; they agreed to abandon their enterprize against Martinico. But having been foiled in this their first attempt, they resolved not to return with the disgrace of having done nothing worthy of the great∣ness of the armament, and the ex∣pectation of their country. They considered, that the island of Gua∣daloupe was an object, though not of such an eclat, of full as much real consequence as Martinico; and they knew, that it was neither so strong in troops or fortifications. Their first failure might lead to an advantage, as considerable as that which they had missed. In pursu∣ance of these resolutions, they set sail for Guadaloupe.</P>
<P>This island is called Guadaloupe, from a resemblance which it bears to a chain of mountains of the same name in Old Spain. To speak with exactness, Guadaloupe is rather to be considered as two islands, divided from each other by a small arm of the sea, or salt-wa∣ter river, not above three hundred feet over where it is widest. One of these islands is called the Grand Terre; the other more particularly and by distinction, Guadaloupe; they are together in circuit about ninety leagues. The first is nearly destitute of fresh water, and not perfectly cultivated; but it is other∣wise with Guadaloupe. No part of the world is furnished with more or better. No less than fifty rivers, in that small circuit, throw themselves into the sea; many navigable by boats, for two, some even for three leagues into the country. Not to
<PB N="89" REF="101"/>
mention the numberless springs which rise among the rocks, and, after a thousand beautiful meanders, lose themselves in the larger streams. The first accounts which we have of that country, are lavish in the de∣scription of its beauties; and the latest agree with them, that no part of the West Indies, perhaps of the world, affords more agreeable and romantic scenes. It is full of high mountains; one of which towers far above the rest, and is a volcano, continually emitting smoke and fire. From hence they have considerable quantities of sulphur. They have also hot baths, fit for all the medi∣cinal purposes in which such wa∣ters are used. The land in the valleys is extremely fertile; it pro∣duces the usual West India commo∣dities, sugar, indigo, coffee, cotton, and ginger: the mountains abound with game: so that there is nothing in the island wanting, for the con∣venience and delight of life, in an air more temperate and salubrious than is commonly breathed between the tropics.</P>
<P>The French began to plant colo∣nies in this island as early as the year 1632. But for a long time this, together with all their other colo∣nies, continued in a languishing con∣dition. It was in the beginning of the present century, that they be∣gan to emerge. After the peace of Utrecht had given France time to breathe, she turned her attention strongly to these islands; Guada∣loupe partook however less of this care than Martinico; and yet, by its natural advantages, it does not fall short of that island, either in the quantity, or the goodness of its produce; if it does not greatly ex∣ceed it in both; as it certainly does in its capacity to receive all sorts of improvement. The importance of this island, until its late conquest, was very little known in England. The reason was this. By an old regulation, the people of Guada∣loupe were forbid to trade directly with Europe, but were obliged to send all their produce to Martinico, from whence also they had all their European commodities. A strange regulation, to be continued in an age so enlightened as this, by a nation so enlightened as France.</P>
<P>The English made attempts upon this island in 1691, and 1703; but they were neither powerful enough, nor conducted with sufficient abi∣lity to produce any permanent ef∣fect; the troops wasted the country, and retired with their booty. But on the occasion, of which we are going to speak, they were more able, strong, and fortunate.</P>
<P>On the 23d of January the fleet came before the town of Basse Terre, the capital of the island; a place of considerable extent, large trade, and defended by a strong fortress. This fortress, in the opinion of the chief engineer, was not to be redu∣ced by the shipping. But Commo∣dore Moore, notwithstanding this opinion, brought four men of war to bear upon the citadel; the rest were disposed against the town, and the batteries which obstructed the landing. About nine in the morn∣ing a fire from all sides began, which continued with the utmost fury un∣til night, when the citadel, and all the batteries, were effectually silen∣ced. During this cannonade the bombs, that were continually show∣ered upon the town, set it on fire in several places. It burned without interruption the whole of this and the following day; when it was al∣most totally reduced to ashes. The loss was prodigious from the num∣ber of warehouses in the town, full of rich, but combustible materials. Nothing could be more striking,
<PB N="90" REF="102"/>
than the horror of the spectacle, from the mutual and unremitted fire of so many great ships and batteries, heightened with a long line of flames, which extended a∣long the shore, and formed the back ground of this terrible picture.</P>
<P>In this lively engagement, our loss was very inconsiderable. The next day the forces landed with∣out opposition, and took possession of the town and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 24.</NOTE> citadel. Notwithstanding this suc∣cess, the island was far from being reduced. The country is rugged and mountainous, and abounded with passes and defiles, of a difficult and dangerous nature. The inha∣bitants had retired with their armed negroes into the mountains; and all seemed prepared to defend their possessions bravely, and to the last extremities.</P>
<P>General Hopson died on the 27th of February, and General Barrington succeeded him. He em∣barked part of his forces for the Grand Terre, where Colonel Crump attacked and reduced the towns of St. Anne, and St. Francois; whilst this attack diverted the enemy's at∣tention, the General fell upon the strong post of Gosier, and possessed himself of it; and thus the Grand Terre was in a manner reduced, and disabled from sending any relief to the other part.</P>
<P>There is a considerable moun∣tain, not far from the town of Basse Terre, called Dos d'Asne, or the Asses' Back; thither a great part of the enemy had retired. It is a post of great strength, and great importance, as it keeps a watch upon the town, and at the same time forms the only communication there is between that town, and the Capes Terre, the plainest, pleasantest, and most fruitful part of the whole island. It was not judged practicable to break into it by this way; and all the rest of Guadaloupe was in the enemy's possession. Therefore a plan was formed for another operation, by which it was proposed to surprize Petit Boutg, Goyave, and St. Ma∣ry's, and by that way to march into Capes Terre, which might be easi∣ly reduced. But this design failing, it was necessary to attempt those places by plain force. Col. Clave∣ring and Col. Crump landed near Arnonville, and attacked the ene∣my, strongly intrenched at a post, strong by nature, called Le Corne. This was forced; another intrench∣ment at Petit Bourg had the same fate; a third near St. Mary's yield∣ed in the same manner. An open∣ing being at last made into the Capes Terre, the inhabitants saw, that the best part of the country was on the point of being given up to fire and sword; they came in and capitulated; their possessions, and their civil and religious liber∣berties were granted to them. <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Three small islands, near Guada∣loupe, Deseada, Santos and Pe∣tite Terre, surrendered a few <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> days after, and on the same terms.</P>
<P>This capitulation was hardly sign∣ed, when the French squadron un∣der M. Bompart appeared before the island, and landed at St. Anne's, in the Grand Terre, the General of the French Caribbees, with six hundred regular troops, two thou∣sand buccaneers, and a large quan∣tity of arms and ammunition. The capitulation was made at the most critical time; for had this reinforce∣ment arrived but a day sooner, the whole expedition had probably been lost.</P>
<P>Thus came into the possession of Great Britain, this valuable island, after a campaign of near three
<PB N="91" REF="103"/>
months, in which the English troops behaved with a firmness, courage and perseverance, that ought never to be forgotten. Intolerable heat, continual fatigue, the air of an un∣accustomed climate, a country full of lofty mountains and steep preci∣pices, posts strong by nature and by art, defended by men who fought for every thing that was dear to them; all these difficulties only increased the ardour of our forces, who thought nothing impossible under commanders, who were not more distinguished for their intre∣pidity and skill, than their zeal for the service of their country, and the perfect harmony and good un∣derstanding that subsisted between them. There is nothing perhaps so necessary to inspire confidence into the soldier, as to observe that the of∣ficers have a perfect confidence in one another.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that many of the inhabitants exerted them∣selves very gallantly in the defence of their country. A woman, a con∣siderable planter in the island, parti∣cularly distinguished herself; she was called <HI>Madam Ducharmey:</HI> this a∣mazon put herself at the head of her servants and slaves, and acquitted herself in a manner not inferior to the bravest men.</P>
<P>Soon after the reduction of Guadaloupe, the island <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26.</NOTE> of Marigalante surrendered itself upon terms similar to those which were granted to the former island. This is a small place, but the conquest is of consequence, as the French by this are left no foot∣ing in the Leeward islands: Mar∣tinico is one of those to the wind∣ward. These beginnings were hap∣py omens to the success of the more important undertaking, which was to be carried on in another part of America. The reputation of our arms there, except in the reduction of Louisbourg, had hitherto not been very great. But other com∣manders were now appointed, and other maxims prevailed. However, we postpone the narrative of these very interesting events, to consider those which intervened on the con∣tinent of Europe, in which too we are to see our arms no less distin∣guished; and to behold England emerging from the rubbish of low principles and timid conduct, once more become the pride and terror of Europe, and acting in a manner not unworthy the most illustrious periods of her history.</P>

<P>WE left the army of Prince Ferdinand upon the retreat, ever since the battle of Bergen. The French advanced with great vivaci∣ty; their light troops made incur∣sions almost to the gates of Ha∣nover. The Prince still continued to retire, but he left garrisons in Lipstadt, Ritberg, Munster and Minden, in order to retard the
<PB N="92" REF="104"/>
enemy's progress: their principal design seemed to be to cut off his retreat to the Weser, to which he kept very close, as he knew the in∣finite consequence of that commu∣nication. However, if the enemy failed to compass that object, all the precautions of the Prince prov∣ed also ineffectual to retard the pro∣gress of their arms. Ritberg was surprised, Lipstadt was blockaded, Minden, was taken by assault, where a garrison of 1500 men were made prisoners, and where immense ma∣gazines fell into their hands. D' Armentieres advanced against Mun∣ster; he attempted to take the place by a coup de main. Though foiled in this attempt with consi∣derable loss, he did not desist; he drew up his cannon from Wesel, and after a short <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> siege, made himself master of the city; the garrison of 4000 men became his prisoners. Nothing seemed able to withstand the ra∣pid torrent with which the French over-ran the whole country; they no longer hoped, the conquest of Hanover; it was with them an ab∣solute certainty. Elated with the fair appearance of their fortune, they kept no bounds The French mini∣ster, the Duke of Belleisle, in his letters to the Marshal Contades, speaks only of the means of securing their con∣quest, and preventing another ex∣pulsion from Hanover; and for this end proposed the most cruel and un∣warrantable expedients. Nor was there less dread and dejection visible on the side of the allies, than pride and confidence on that of the French. The archives and most valuable moveables were sent off from Hano∣ver to Stade. All things seemed hastening to the same posture which drew on the famous capitulation of Closter Seven.</P>
<P>In this general gloom that over∣spread the fortune of the allies, the Prince kept himself unmoved and attentive to his designs. He did not suffer himself to be disconcerted by blows, which he had probably fore∣seen, and the ill consequences of which he knew how to prevent. The body of the French army after the taking of Minden, had posted themselves near that city, to which the right of their army extended; their left was protected by a very steep hill; in their front was a large morass; and a rivulet covered their rear. Nothing could be more ad∣vantageous than this situation; and whilst they continued in it, nothing could be enterprized against them. The army of the allies after a con∣tinued retreat, began at last to ad∣vance, and fixed their camp altoge∣ther as advantageously at Petersha∣gen, a place about three leagues from the enemy.</P>
<P>Things were brought to that pass, that nothing but a battle could hinder the French from taking winter quarters in the electorate. There was no possibility of at∣tacking them with any hope of success in the camp which they then occupied. The point was to draw them from that post into the plain; but the movements ne∣cessary to effect this were extreme∣ly hazardous to an inferior army, in fight of the enemy. The ope∣rations of Prince Ferdinand, on this occasion, displayed so pene∣trating and uncommon a genius, such a guarded boldness, such a certainty of the grounds he went upon, such a perfect possession of himself, that perhaps there is no instance in history of generalship so compleat and finished; for which reason we shall endeavour from the best lights we have, to draw out at length the several parts that con∣to
<PB N="93" REF="105"/>
form this remarkable piece; we could indeed wish that the authentick accounts of so very memorable an event, had been more clear and explicit; but we must content ourselves with the ma∣terials we have.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July, Prince Fer∣dinand forsook his camp on the Weser, and marched towards Hil∣len, a village considerably to his right, with the greatest part of his army: However he took care to leave on the brink of that river, a body under General Wangenheim; which extended to the town of Thornhausen, where they were intrenched, and supported by a considerable artillery. He had the day before detached the He∣reditary Prince of Brunswick, <NOTE PLACE="marg">July, 28.</NOTE> with 6000 men, to make a compass towards the enemy's left flank, and to post himself in such a manner, as to cut off the commu∣nication of their convoys from Pader∣born.</P>
<P>The French were not inat∣tentive to these movements; their Generals immediately held a coun∣cil of war; and the result was, that they gave completely into the snare that was laid for them. They saw, as they imagined, the allied army divided and disjointed; and now the happy moment presented itself, for the attack of General Wangen∣heim, who they knew was not strong, and who seemed at a great distance from the rest of the army, so that it appeared impossible that he could be relieved. This body being routed, as it easily might, it was obvious that they should then be able to place themselves be∣tween Prince Ferdinand's army and the Weset, and cut off his commu∣nication with that river; the great object at which they aimed, through the whole campaign, and in which was involved the certain destruction of the allies.</P>
<P>Full of these ideas they left their advantageous post, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1.</NOTE> in eight columns passed the morass in their front, and advanced into the plain. The Duke of Broglio was to lead the attack, by falling upon that body that lay near the river, which seemed to present him an assured and easy victory. He marched on, therefore, with great confidence; but as soon as he had gained an e∣minence which lay along his front, he was struck with the utmost sur∣prize, when, instead of a few posts weakly guarded, he beheld the whole army of the allies drawn up in excellent order, extending from the banks of the Weser, quite to the morass, in the front of the late French camp. This was a stroke entirely unexpected: they believed the Prince to have been at Hillen; but he had marched up, and the whole army was joined in the night. This discovery for a while put a stop to the motions of the French; they were hemmed in between the allies, the morass and the river. Their situation was disagreeable, but it was now impossible to recede.</P>
<P>The allies, finding the French slower than they expected, began to advance, and threatened the e∣nemy's center. This was composed almost wholly of horse; but it was the flower of their cavalry, who anticipated the shock of the al∣lies, and began the engagement. The brunt of the battle was almost wholly sustained by the English infantry, and some corps of Hanoverians, which stood the reiterated charges of so many bo∣dies of horse, the strength and glory of the French armies, with a resolution, steadiness, and expert∣ness in their manoeuvre, which was
<PB N="94" REF="106"/>
never exceeded, perhaps never e∣qualled. They cut to pieces or en∣tirely routed these bodies. Two brigades of foot attempted to sup∣port them, but they vanished before the English infantry. Waldgrave's and Kingsley's regiments distinguished themselves in a particular manner this day; nor were their command∣ers less distinguished. The enemy's horse which composed their center being entirely discomfited, and their right, which attacked Wangenheim, having made no sort of impression, they thought of nothing but a re∣treat.</P>
<P>At this point of time the Prince sent orders to Ld. George Sackville, who commanded the whole British, and several brigades of the German cavalry to advance. That cavalry formed the right wing of the allies, extended to the morass, and if it could have charged at the instant of the enemy's retreat, such a shock at that time, and in that situation, would in all probability have left the French without an army in Ger∣many. But the orders were not sufficiently precise, or they were not sufficiently understood by the English commander; so that there was some delay in waiting for an explanation. The critical minute passed away; the British cavalry lost their share in the glory of the action; and the French retreated in some order, favoured by the spirited and well-judged efforts of the Duke of Broglio, and the advantages which the possession of Minden gave them.</P>
<P>What is remarkable, the French attributed their misfortune in this battle to the same error in their disposition, which lost them the battle of Blenheim; that of com∣posing their center almost wholly of cavalry, without any proper sup∣port of foot.</P>
<P>The battle was over; but then it was that the effects of Prince Ferdi∣nand's admirable dispositions ap∣peared in their full lustre. The French not having been molested by the British cavalry in their re∣treat, had an opportunity of re∣gaining their former advantageous post. They had, indeed, lost the honour of the day, and missed the stroke which they had meditated. They had likewise lost a great num∣ber of men. But all these losses and disgraces might be repaired, and there seemed nothing decisive in the day of Minden. It had cer∣tainly happened, as it then ap∣peared, if the Prince who foresee∣ing this, and neglecting nothing which could be provided, had not formed the plan of detaching away the Hereditary Prince in the man∣ner already related. At five in the morning of that day, this young hero attacked a large body of the French under the Duke de Brisac; this body, though posted in a most advantageous manner, he entirely defeated, and obliged them to take refuge in Minden. The news of this blow came with an ill omen to M. de Contades, in the instant when the English infantry began to engage his center. The enemy himself could not help admiring the dexterity of the stroke under which he sunk: and full of astonishment at a con∣duct at once so daring and judicious, paid the just applause to a Ge∣neral, who could detach with secu∣rity so large a body from his army, when he was going to attack an e∣nemy already much superior to him in numbers.</P>
<P>This happy stroke decided the affair, all the passes through which
<PB N="95" REF="107"/>
the French could draw succour or provision, were seized. They re∣linquished their strong post; they fled through Minden, and passing the Weser, retreated to the east∣ward of that river; thus losing all the advantages which they had made in the campaign, and forced to retreat through a country dif∣ferent from that through which they had advanced, and in which they had taken no measures to pro∣cure subsistance.</P>
<P>The loss of the French in this action amounted to about seven thou∣sand men killed, wounded and pri∣soners; among whom were many officers of considerable rank. The loss of the allies was not more than two thousand. The English as they gained the greatest glory, so they were the greatest sufferers. Twelve hundred of the killed and wounded were of that nation. The Prince on the day after the battle paid the due honours to these illustrious corps, as well as to several of the Hanoverians who had behaved in the same gallant manner. He did justice to the merit of the officers; he distinguished their names; and even particularised so low as cap∣tains. To some in the most o∣bliging manner he sent considerable presents; and he omitted nothing to shew that he knew what it is to be well served, and how to en∣courage the troops and officers to do their duty with spirit and cheer∣fulness.</P>
<P>Although the English had the greatest share in the honour of this signal day, and that the Prince ac∣knowledged their merit in the strongest terms, yet a cloud was cast over their triumph. There were some expressions in the orders for the rejoicing, which were supposed to convey a very severe reflection on Lord G. S. commander in chief of the English forces. The Prince re∣quired with an emphasis, which seemed particularly pointed, that his orders by his aids de camps for the future should be more ex∣actly obeyed. In a manner still less to be misunderstood, he expressed his concern that the Marquis of Granby had not had the com∣mand of the British cavalry. Had he commanded, his highness made no doubt that the success of the day had been much more compleat and brilliant. The severe insinua∣tion concerning the disobedience to orders, and the invidious compli∣ment to a subordinate officer, were clear declarations.</P>
<P>The news of a victory so glorious to our troops, and of a censure so disgraceful to their commander, came at once to England. In propor∣tion to the joy which filled all hearts, in proportion to their opinion of the great general to whom they owed so seasonable an advantage, was their indignation against the unfortunate commander to whom it was attri∣buted that this advantage was not greater. The public as usual judged definitively upon the first charge. They never pardon a general whose error it is to fall short. In vain they are prayed to suspend their judg∣ment, and to wait for a full dis∣cussion; the matter is already decid∣ed; they have a fact against an offi∣cer, and they look upon all reason∣ing in his favour, not so much a defence of his conduct, as the exer∣tion of eloquence and artifice to pal∣liate a neglect of duty. This indeed makes the case of officers particularly hard; but then it always shews them what they have to do.</P>
<P>The merits of the matter are
<PB N="96" REF="108"/>
still regarded in the same light by the public. But the heat, the ea∣gerness, and curiosity of the first movements being over, the matter will be heard, whenever it comes to be again discussed with less attention, but with less passion too. It is not for us to deliver any opinion in so nice a controversy. We have in points of less moment hitherto de∣clined it; and we shall always de∣cline it until the proper judges be∣fore whom it probably will come, shall have taught us what to think. There is indeed no doubt that if the cavalry of the allies right wing, si∣tuated as it was, had been brought to act at the critical time when it had orders to move, the battle of Min∣den had proved as decisive as that of Hocstet. But whether it was a fault in the giving or the delivering of the orders, or whether it was some mis∣apprehension in him who received them, we cannot but sincerely pity a commander of such admirable ta∣lents, who by the error or the mis∣fortune of a moment, lost an op∣portunity that would have ranked him for ever with the Marlboroughs and the Brunswicks.</P>
<P>A few days after the battle his lordship resigned his command and returned to London. He was but a few days in London when he was deprived of all his military em∣ployments. The Marquis of Gran∣by, whom the opinion of Prince Ferdinand, and the desires of the whole army had pointed out, suc∣ceeded him in his command. A generous and ardent courage, an affability of manners that flowed from no artifice, a manly freedom and openness of soul, a chearful and unreserved conversation, a mu∣nificence that knew no bounds, so many qualities of the man and of the soldier, endeared him to the whole army, and rendered English and foreigners, his inferiors, his e∣quals and his superior in command, unanimous in his favour.</P>
<P>Whilst these changes were mak∣ing, Prince Ferdinand lost no time to improve his victory, by the pur∣suit of the French who retired in the utmost distress. The allies were not indeed able to overtake the main body of their army, but they harassed them extremely, and the French were obliged to sacrifice a great part of their army piece∣meal to preserve the rest entire. The necessity of providing sub∣sistence drove them towards Cassel. The Prince pursued them, obliged them to evacuate that place, and once more freed that poor distressed country from the French tyranny. The castle of Ziegenhayn after an hour's defence gave the allies about four hundred prisoners. After this the Heredi∣tary <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug 23.</NOTE> Prince of Brunswick, equally conspicuous in the greater and the lesser operations of war, made a private march at night in or∣der <NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> to surprize a corps of French irregulars commanded by the fa∣mous partizan Fischer, which were posted at Wetter, where it was convenient for the allies to en∣camp. This corps he entirely rout∣ed, killing a great number and taking four hundred. The French threw a garrison into Marpurg, in hopes of putting some stop to the rapid career of the allies. In effect this did prove an obstacle for some days, but at length the castle surren∣dered, and the garrison consisting of between eight <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11.</NOTE> and nine hundred men became pri∣soners of war.</P>
<P>Here a bound was set of the pro∣gress
<PB REF="109"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE MARQUIS OF GRANBY</HEAD>

<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
of the allied arms. Not that they were stopped by any consider∣able obstruction from the main body of the French in that quarter, but from some effects in another quar∣ter of the unsuccessful beginning of the campaign, from which the bat∣tle of Minden had not yet perfectly disengaged them. Munster was still behind them, and still in the hands of the enemy, who had a power∣ful garrison in that city. M. de Contades, who even after his de∣feat exceeded the allies in numbers, and had now no further view of an offensive campaign, sent a strong body under d'Armentieres, which was reinforced by some troops from the Lower Rhine, to near fifteen thousand men, to cover that place. Prince Ferdinand had before detach∣ed General Imhoff from Cassel in order to reduce it. On the ap∣proach of d'Armentieres, Imhoff was obliged to raise the siege. But <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 6.</NOTE> being soon after reinforced, the French commander re∣tired in his turn towards Wesel, the possession of which place has all a∣long proved of infinite importance to the French in all their operations. The siege of Munster was again resumed, but the business threaten∣ed to be difficult and tedious. This however was the only rub which the allies encountered. In all other respects they were perfectly fortu∣nate. They had driven their e∣nemy two hundred miles before them, and at the end of the cam∣paign, after all their efforts, and all their sanguine hopes of conquest, set them down just where they had begun it.</P>
<P>The event of the battle of Min∣den, and the subsequent misfortunes of the French arms, threw Ver∣sailles into the utmost confusion. The news of that defeat arrived just as the King was taking horse to hunt. He retired silent and deject∣ed into the apartment of Madam de Pompadour, and for some time saw none of his ministers. The Duke of Broglio and M. de Contades mu∣tually accused each other, for the ill conduct of that day. The public acquitted Broglio. Belleisle and his general Contades lost all reputation: but the duke still preserved his em∣ployment and a considerable part of his influence at court.</P>
<P>As soon as the first confusion and surprize of so unexpected an event was a little abated; it was resolved to send reinforcements to their ar∣my in Germany, and at the same time to send thither some officer of experience and authority, who might judge, and compose, if pos∣sible, the differences which subsist∣ed between the commanders; as well as to assist in the deliberations for retrieving their affairs. Pub∣lic misfortunes call great men from their obscurity. M. de Etrees was chosen on this occasion, and in∣vested with an authority which he unwillingly accepted. When he arrived at the French camp, he could not avoid <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 25.</NOTE> a sigh on viewing of the ruins of that army, which had triumphed under his command at Hastenbeck. However, his behaviour to M. de Contades was polite and generous. The old Marechal told him that he was not come to take his com∣mand, but to serve under him; and whilst he assisted him with his advice, he would receive his or∣ders.</P>
<P>Whilst the French endeavoured to piece up their broken fortune in Germany, they made some show
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
of pushing the other part of their scheme with vigour. All their ports were full of the preparations for an invasion of the British dominions. Men of war, transports and flat∣bottomed boats, now almost a word of ridicule, were prepared with great diligence. They talked of a triple embarkation. M. Thurot was to command a small squadron and several transports from Dun∣kirk, which it was believed were intended for Scotland. This man from a master of a merchant ship became a captain of a privateer, in which capacity he greatly annoyed the English trade, and acquired a reputation. At a time when France does not abound with great men, his services in this way and his da∣ring spirit, recommended him to a command in the King's service.</P>
<P>The design against England, as the voyage hither is the shortest, was to be attempted from Havre, and some other ports of Normandy, in flat-bottomed boats. The third embarkation, which was supposed against Ireland, was to be made from Vannes in the Lower Brit∣tany, where a large body of troops was assembled, commanded by the Duke d'Aiguillon governor of that province. This embarkation was to be covered by the fleet under M. de Conflans, which was preparing with great diligence in Brest. Had this design been such as it was repre∣sented, and had it been put into execution, there is no doubt but such an attempt upon both king∣doms, at three different places at once, must have thrown the whole into no small confusion. But ex∣cellent measures were taken on the part of England to frustrate their designs, whatever they might have been.</P>
<P>A squadron under Commodore Boys was stationed before Dun∣kirk. Admiral Rodney was sent to bombard Havre, which service he performed with success. Admiral Hawke blocked up the harbour of Brest with a strong squadron, whilst a lesser kept a watch upon that of Vannes. These precautions were continued the whole summer, during which time the French pro∣ceeded rather slowly, but after the battle of Minden had destroyed their hopes in Germany, they turn∣ed to this object with the greater attention. What issue it had we shall relate in its proper place. But their first attempts on the ocean proved as unsuccessful as their arms on land.</P>
<P>A great fleet was equipped at Toulon, which some destined for America, whilst others believed it was designed to unite itself with that of Brest to favour the invasion. Admiral Boscawen who command∣ed in the Mediterranean, blocked up this squadron, until some unfa∣vourable weather and the foulness of his ships obliged him to return to Gibraltar to refit. The French took this opportunity to sail out, and they pro∣ceeded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14.</NOTE> with great diligence to the streights.</P>
<P>They had arrived very near Gi∣braltar before the admiral had no∣tice of their approach; but not∣withstanding that our ships were not perfectly prepared to sail, the admi∣ral used such great expedition that in two hours after the account arrived the English fleet was out at sea.</P>
<P>The English fleet was composed of fourteen ships of the line besides frigates. The enemy had twelve of the line. They were superior in the bulk of their ships and in the
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
number of men, if they were inferior in the number of vessels; and it is the opinion of many persons of judg∣ment, that if they had formed a line of battle, and fought Mr. Bof∣cawen in order, they might very well have hoped for a better issue of this matter than they found. But the evil genius of France operating on the cowardice or incapacity of their commander, induced them to separate their fleet and fly. The English ships were newly refitted; they proved better sailors; and the men, animated with the spirited example of their Admiral, en∣gaged the French ships as they could overtake them; and they overtook some of them off Cape Lagos in Portugal. A brisk eagage∣ment ensued. Two of the enemy's ships, the Ocean and the Redoubt∣able, were run on shore and burn∣ed. The first was the ship of M. de la Clue, the French Admiral, who escaped to land; but being grie∣vously wounded, and, as it is said, having lost both his legs, he died soon after. Two other capital ships, the Centaure and Modeste, were taken.</P>
<P>The scattered remains of their fleet with difficulty got into the harbour of Cadiz, where they were soon after blocked up, and where they still remain. This action hap∣pened on the 18th of August; and it gave a great eclat to the British arms, which, in the same month, had triumphed so signally both by sea and land.</P>

<P>AS the King of Prussia's victory at Rosbach had given the Hanoverians an opportunity to free their country, it might be ex∣pected that the affair at Minden would have served to free his Prus∣sian Majesty from some of the nu∣merous armies that oppressed him. But as this battle was fought in the middle of the season for action, and as Munster still continued in the possession of the French, Prince Ferdinand could not venture at that time, to make any detachment from his army in the King's favour, without risquing all the advantages which he had obtained from his victory. The King of Prussia was therefore left alone to struggle with Austrians, Russians, Imperialists and Swedes</P>
<P>The Russians, whose motions go∣verned those of all the other armies, left their camp at Posna in Poland, and quitting the Vistula, drew near to the banks of the Oder. They were under the command of a Russian nobleman, Count Soltikoff. Count Dohna, who had been order∣ed to oppose them, saw that their numbers were too considerable, and their posts too strong to be attack∣ed with any prospect of advantage, so that he contented himself with observing their motions, and ha∣rassing their march. This conduct seemed more dilatory and timid than the circumstances, or the in∣clinations
<PB N="100" REF="113"/>
of the King could bear. He is said to have reproached that General in so severe a manner, for a conduct in which he was in all pro∣bability very justifiable, that he took the first opportunity to resign his command, and, under a pretence of recovering his health, retired to Berlin. The King immediately put General Wedel into his place, with positive orders to engage the Rus∣sian army at all events. To enable him to obey his commands, he re∣inforced him with several detach∣ments from his own army. The positiveness of the King's orders on this occasion may perhaps be cen∣sured; but it must be owned, that the time required a course next to desperate. His hereditary domi∣nions were in the utmost danger, and nothing but some great and fortunate stroke could effectually prevent the junction of the Austrian and Russian armies, an event which, of all others, he had the greatest rea∣son to dread.</P>
<P>Fortified in some measure by the reinforcements he had received, and in consequence of his orders, Ge∣neral Wedel resolved to attack the Russians on their march. They <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> had got to Zulichau and directed their course to Crossen in Silesia, to get before the Prussian army, and to make good the passage of the Oder. The situ∣ation of the Russians was very ad∣vantageous; posted upon eminen∣ces, defended by a powerful artil∣lery, and near seventy thousand strong. The Prussian army fell short of thirty thousand; and they had greater disadvantages than their inferiority of number to get over. They had a bridge to pass, and such a narrow defile to struggle through, that scarce a third of a battalion could march in front. The ground was such, that the cavalry could not support their infantry. Yet with all these difficulties the attack was long and resolute. But this resolution made their repulse, which all these disadvantages had rendered inevitable, far more bloody and distressful. Four thousand se∣ven hundred were killed or pri∣soners: the wounded came to three thousand. General Wobersnow, an officer of great ability, was killed, and General Manteuffel was wounded. The Prussians were obliged to re∣tire, but they were not pursued, and they passed the Oder without mo∣lestation. The Russians seized upon the towns of Crossen and Frankfort on the Oder.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia, since the be∣ginning of the war, had never hi∣therto obtained an advantage where he was not personally present. His presence now became more necessa∣ry than ever. Since the action at Zulichau, the Russians had pene∣trated a considerable way into his territories, and had taken possession of the important city of Frankfort upon the Oder. He therefore marched with ten thousand of his best troops, to join the broken army of Wedel, in order to drive this formidable and determined enemy from his country. Prince Henry command∣ed the remainder of his army, which was too well posted to fear any in∣sult during his absence. The eyes of all were fixed upon his march, and his soldiers, who remembered Zorndorf, eagerly longed to try their strength once more with the same antagonists.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not unapprised of the motions of the Russians, or the designs of the King of Prussia. He knew that the great fault of the
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
Russian troops, was the want of a regular and firm cavalry, which might be depended upon in a day of action. This defect was a prin∣cipal cause of their misfortune at Zorndorf in the last year; a mis∣fortune which disconcerted all the operations of that campaign. As this was the only want which the Russians were under, so it was that which Daun was best able to supply at a short warning. With this view he selected about twelve thousand of his horse, and there is no better horse than that of the Austrians, which with about eight thousand foot he placed under the command of General Laudon, one of the a∣blest officers in that service. This body was divided into two columns, one of which marched through Si∣lesia, and the other through Lu∣satia. By extreme good fortune and conduct with little loss or oppo∣sition, they both joined the Russian army, and were received with tran∣sports of joy.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King of Prussia, who was unable to prevent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4.</NOTE> this stroke, joined General Wedel at Muhlrose, and took upon him the command of the united armies. But still finding him∣self too weak for the decisive action he was preparing to attempt, he re∣called Gen. Finck, whom he had sent some time before into Saxony with nine thousand men, in order to oppose the Imperialists in that coun∣try. With these reinforcements he was not able to raise his army to fifty thousand compleat. That of the Russians since the junction of Laudon, was upwards of ninety thousand. They had besides taken a post which they had so strongly entrenched, and defended with such a prodigious number of cannon, that it was extremely difficult and hazardous to attempt them, yet un∣der these accumulated disadvanta∣ges, it was absolutely necessary that he should fight. The detachments from Count Daun's army already menaced Berlin; Saxony which he was obliged to leave exposed, had become a prey to the Imperialists; and the Russians united with the Austrians encamped before his eyes in Silesia, the best and richest part of his dominions. In short, his for∣mer reputation, his present difficul∣ties, his future hopes, every mo∣tive of honour and of safety de∣manded an engagement; the cam∣paign hasted to a decision, and it was evident that nothing farther could be done by marches and choice of posts. The sanguine tem∣per of other generals has often obli∣ged them to fight under disadvan∣tages; but the King of Prussia's cir∣cumstances were such, that from the multitude of his enemies, he was neither able to consult times nor situations. Rashness could hardly dictate, any thing which in his con∣dition, would not have been recom∣mended by prudence.</P>
<P>When the attack was resolved, the King's troops <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12.</NOTE> put themselves in motion at two in the morning, and having formed themselves in a wood, advanced to∣wards the enemy. It was near e∣leven before the action began. The principal effort of the King of Prus∣sia was against the left wing of the Russian army. He began ac∣cording to their usual method, with a fierce cannonade, which hav∣ing had the effect he desired from it, he attacked that wing with several battalions disposed in columns.</P>
<P>The Russian entrenchments were forced with great slaughter. Se∣venty-two pieces of cannon were
<PB N="102" REF="115"/>
taken. But still there was a defile to be passed, and several redoubts to be mastered which covered the village of Cunnersdorf. These were attacked with the same resolution, and taken one after another. The enemy made another stand at the village, and endeavoured to pre∣serve their ground there, by push∣ing forward several battalions of horse and foot; but their resistance there proved not more effectual than it had done every where else; they were driven from post to post quite to the last redoubts. For up∣wards of six hours Fortune favour∣ed the Prussians, who every where broke the enemy with an unparal∣lelled slaughter. They had driven them from almost all the ground which they had occupied before the battle, they had taken more than half their artillery; scarce any thing seemed wanting to the most com∣plete decision.</P>
<P>The King in those circumstances wrote a billet to the Queen to this effect, <Q>“Madam, we have beat the Russians from their entrench∣ments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.”</Q> This news arrived at Berlin, just as the post was going out, and the friends of the King of Prussia throughout Europe, exulted in a certain and conclusive victory. Mean time For∣tune was preparing for him a terrible reverse.</P>
<P>The enemy, defeated in almost every quarter, found their left wing shattered as it was, to be more en∣tire than any other part of the army. Count Soltikoff therefore assembled the remains of his right, and ga∣thering as many as he could from the center, reinforced that wing, and made a stand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advanta∣geous eminence, in a place called <HI>the Jews burying ground.</HI> Nothing was wanting to finish matters in fa∣vour of the King, but to drive the Russians from this their last hope. But this enterprize was difficult. It is confidently said, that the Prus∣sian generals were unanimous in opinion, that they should not en∣deavour at that time to push any further the advantages they had obtained. They represented to the King, that the enemy was still ve∣ry numerous, their artillery consi∣derable, and the post which they occupied of great strength; that his brave troops who had been en∣gaged for so long a time, in the se∣verest action perhaps ever known, and in one of the hottest days ever felt, were too much exhausted for a new attempt; an attempt of such extreme difficulty as might daunt even troops that were quite fresh. That the advantage he gained would be as decisive in its conse∣quences as that at Zorndorf; and whilst the enemy filled the gazettes of their party, with frivolous dis∣putes of the field of battle, he would be reaping as he did then, all the ef∣fects of an unquestioned victory. That the enemy would be obliged to retire immediately into Poland, and to leave him at liberty to act in other quarters, where his presence was full as necessary.</P>
<P>These reasons were very cogent; and for a few moments they seemed to have some weight with the King. But his character soon determined him to a contrary resolution. He could not bear to be a conqueror by halves. One effort more was a∣lone wanting to that victory, which would free him for ever from the adversary, which had leaned heavi∣est on him during the whole war.</P>
<P>Once more he put all to the ha∣zard.
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
His infantry still resolute and supported by their late success, were readily brought to act again. They drew on their bodies fainting with heat and labour to a new attack. But the enterprize was beyond their strength. The situation of the ene∣my was impregnable; and their ar∣tillery which began to be superior to that of the Prussians, on account of the difficulty of the ground, which made it impossible for the latter to bring up any other than a few small pieces, repulsed these feeble batta∣lions with a great slaughter. With an astonishing, perhaps with a blame∣able perseverance, the Prussian in∣fantry was brought to a second at∣tack, and were a second time re∣pulsed, and with a loss greater than at first. These efforts being unsuc∣cessful, the affair was put to the ca∣valry. They made redoubled but useless attacks; the horses were spent as well as those they carried.</P>
<P>It was just at that time when the Prussian horse was wasted by these unsuccessful efforts, that the greatest part of the Russian, and the whole body of the Austrian cavalry, which had been hitherto quite inactive, and which was therefore quite fresh, rushed down upon them, broke them to pieces, forced them back up∣on their foot, and threw the whole into irreparable disorder. The whole army was seized with a panic; and in a few minutes those troops so lately victorious and irresistable, were total∣ly dispersed and defeated. The King did every thing to restore the field, hazarding his person even be∣yond his former daring, and prodi∣gal of a life which he seemed to think ought not to be separated from conquest. Thrice he led on his troops to the charge; two horses were killed under him; several balls were in his cloaths, The ef∣forts of skill, courage and despair were made, and proved ineffectual; a single error outweighed them all. Scarcely a general, hardly an infe∣rior officer in the army was without some wound. That of General Seidlitz was particularly unfortunate; for to that wound the failure of the horse which he commanded was principally attributed. It was to the spirit and conduct of this able officer, that a great part of the success at Zorndorf was owing, in the last cam∣paign. Is is known, that if it had not been for a seasonable movement of the horse, the whole Prussian army had then been in great danger of a defeat.</P>
<P>The night and the prudent use of some eminences, which were de∣fended as well as circumstances would admit, preserved the Prussian army from total destruction. However, their loss was far greater than any which they had sustained from the beginning of the war. All their cannon was taken. The killed, wounded and prisoners, by the most favourable accounts were near twen∣ty thousand. General Putkammer was killed on the spot. These ge∣nerals whose names are so distinguish∣ed in this war, Itzenplitz, Hulsen, Finck, Wedel, and Seidlitz, were among the wounded; as was the Prince of Wurtenburg, and five ma∣jor generals. The enemy could not have fewer than ten thousand killed on their side. For hardly ever was a more bloody battle.</P>
<P>When the King of Prussia found himself obliged to quit the field, he sent another dispatch to the Queen expressed in this manner, <Q>“Re∣move from Berlin with the roy∣al family. Let the archives be
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
carried to Potzdam. The town may make conditions with the enemy.”</Q> We should in vain at∣tempt to draw the picture of the court and city, on the receipt of such news in the midst of the joy, which they indulged for that which they had received but a few hours before. The terror was increased by the in∣distinct relation that soon followed, which gave them only to understand that their army was totally routed; that there was no account of the King, and that a Russian army was advancing to take possession of their city.</P>
<P>The day after the battle the King of Prussia repassed the Oder, and encamped at Retwein. From thence he moved to Fustenwalde, and placed himself in such a manner that the Russians did not venture to make any attempt upon Berlin. He continually watched their army; a part of which instead of turning to∣wards Brandenburgh marched into Lusatia, where it joined that of the Austrians. Here the victorious Ge∣neral Soltikoff, for the first time, met M. Daun, and amidst rejoicings and congratulations, consulted about the measures for improving their success.</P>
<P>The Russian and Austrian armies thus united, scarce seemed from their strength and their victories to have any other deliberation left, than of what part of the Prussian dominions they should take imme∣diate possession. The King was twice defeated with a vast loss. He was cut off from all communication with the army of his brother Prince Henry; yet to the astonishment of all the world, the superior, the victorious and united army acted upon the defensive, and were cur∣bed in all their motions, and frus∣trated in all their designs by the in∣ferior, the beaten and divided. Nothing ever shewed the genius of the King of Prussia more fully than his conduct after the battle of Cunnersdorf. In a few days after so terrible a defeat, every thing was in order in his camp. He sup∣plied the loss of his artillery from his stores in Berlin. He recalled Ge∣neral Kleist with about five thou∣sand men from Pomerania; in pre∣sence of two such armies as those of M. Daun and Count Soltikoff, he detached six thousand men from his small body, to the relief of Saxony, where the army of the Empire had availed itself of his absence to reduce the whole coun∣try. Hall, Wittemberg, Leipsic, Torgan, and at last Dresden itself had opened their gates to the Im∣perialists. With the remainder of his troops he put himself between the Russians and Great Glogau, co∣vered that city which was the ob∣ject of the enemy's designs, and saw them soon after, notwithstand∣ing their two victories, obliged to return again into Poland; and to leave him free for the rest of the campaign.</P>
<P>What was done by the King of Prussia since that time, will be the subject of another chapter; after we have related the proceedings of the English and French in America, to which the order of time directs our present attention. But we cannot dismiss the affairs of Germany, in which two such battles as those of Minden and Cunnersdorf were fought, with events so different for the common cause, without observing something concerning the two gene∣rals who conducted them.</P>
<P>They are certainly in reputation the first in Europe, which probably
<PB N="105" REF="118"/>
never produced two greater men; Tho' they differ as much in their cha∣racters, and in the kind of talents they possess, as they agree in the greatness of their abilities for war. The King of Prussia, rapid, vehe∣ment, impatient, often gives deci∣sive blows; but he often misses his stroke, and wounds himself. Prince Ferdinand is cool, deliberate, ex∣act, and guarded; he sees every possible advantage, he takes it at the moment, pursues it as far as it will go; but never attempts to push it further. Nothing in the man disturbs the commander. In him we do not see a person who is a great soldier; it is the idea of a perfect General; it is a general in the abstract. Fer∣dinand suffers his temper to be gui∣ded by his business. He never pre∣cipitates matters; he takes them in their order and their course, and trusts nothing to fortune. The King on the other hand leads, and even forces circumstances; he does not endeavour to remove but to over∣leap obstacles; he puts all to the risque; and by suffering Fortune to play her part in his designs, he ac∣quires a splendor and eclat in his actions, which mere wisdom could never give him. Prince Ferdinand is famous for never committing a fault. The King of Prussia is above all the world, in repairing those he has committed. Like some of the great masters in writing, whenever he makes or seems to make a mis∣take, it is a signal to the observer, to prepare for some great and ad∣mirable stroke of spirit and conduct. His errors seem to be spurs to his abilities. He commits an error, he repairs it; he errs again; and a∣gain astonishes us by his manner of escaping. We should often con∣demn the commander, but that we are always forced to admire the hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Plan of the campaign in North America. Three expeditions. Ticonderoga and Crown Point abandoned. Col Townshend killed. Expedition to Nia∣gara. Col. Prideaux killed. Sir William Johnson defeats the French. Takes Fort Niagara. Consequençes of this.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE theatre of our operations in America is of such a vast extent, that if we had persevered in the course we pursued for some time, in attacking but one place at once, the war would inevitably be spun out to an extreme length, without bringing on any thing de∣cisive; and it would have rendered our natural superiority of little use, by suffering the French to collect, as they had hitherto done, their strength into one single point, which enabled them to contend with us, with a force sufficient for the ser∣vice in that country. This year a∣nother method was followed. It was proposed to attack the French in all their strong posts at once; to fall as nearly as possible at the same time upon Crown Point, Niagara, and the forts to the south of Lake Erie, whilst a great naval armament, and a considerable body of land∣forces should attempt Quebec, by the River St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>This plan was very advisable, as it tended to weaken by distracting the resistance of the enemy, and whilst we adhered to it, it was clearly impossible for the French to main∣tain their ground in any of those
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
places which were attacked, with∣out very weakly defending, or even deserting some of the others; and if, by the means of such diversions, any one of those places should fall into our hands, the campaign could not be said to be spent to no pur∣pose. But besides the end in dis∣tracting the enemy's defence, there was another proposed of no less con∣sequence; which was to make a concurrence in all the various ope∣rations, so that whilst they divided the enemy, they might mutually sup∣port one another.</P>
<P>General Amherst, who commands the American forces in chief, with the most considerable body, amount∣ing, in regulars and provincials, to about twelve thousand men, was to attack Ticonderoga and Crown Point by Lake George; the re∣duction of those forts would natu∣rally lay open the Lake Champlain, where, having established a sufficient naval force, he was by the River Sorel, which forms the communi∣cation between this Lake and the great River St. Lawrence, to pro∣ceed directly to Quebec, the capital of Canada. Here he was to make a junction with General Wolfe and Admiral Saunders, who, having en∣tered the River St. Lawrence at the opposite quarter, would probably have commenced the siege of Que∣bec, by the time that General Am∣herst might find it practicable to join them. It was not doubted that if this junction could be affected, the reduction of that city would fol∣low of course.</P>
<P>The third of the grand operations was against the fort, near the Falls of Niagara; a place of very great consequence both in war and in peace. The reduction of this was committed to Brigadier General Prideaux, under whom Sir William Johnson commanded the provinci∣als of New York, and several Indi∣ans of the Five Nations, who were engaged in our service by the credit that gentleman has obtained among their tribes.</P>
<P>The object of this operation lay too remote from the others, to ex∣pect, with any great confidence, that they could be assisted by its success in any other manner than by weak∣ening the enemy's forces. However it was hoped, that if they should be fortunate enough to take Niagara, early in the season, the troops might be embarked on the Lake Ontario, and finding no longer any obstruction from Fort Fronte∣nac, which was destroyed last year, might fall down the River St. Law∣rence, and possibly either make themselves masters of Montreal, or by their approach at least, draw such a force to that part, as greatly to facilitate our designs upon Quebec and Crown Point. But if this scheme, in addition to its own end, should not facilitate either of the other two capital undertakings, it would probably, as it was the most im∣portant place the French had in that part of the world, draw all the troops they had upon the lakes to at∣tempt its relief, which would leave the forts on those lakes exposed to a fourth though inferior expedition, which was made against them under General Stanwix. In reality, it af∣terwards had that effect.</P>
<P>The army under General Am∣herst was the first in motion. The Lake George, or, as the French call it, Lake Sacrament, is a long, but, in proportion, narrow water, about forty miles in length, and enclosed on either side with mar∣shy grounds. This communicates
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
by another long and very narrow streight with Lake Champlain. This streight is secured at each side by a fort; that to the side of Lake George is called Ticonderoga; that to the Champlain Lake is called Fort Frederick, or Crown Point; both extremely strong in their si∣tuation; and the former of which had repulsed our troops with a very considerable slaughter, as has been related amongst the events of the last year.</P>
<P>Amherst after he had passed Lake George, arrived with very little opposition from the enemy before Ticonderoga; at first the French made some appearance, as if they meant to defend the place; but as they knew the strength of our forces, as they saw that the preparations for the attack were making with as much judgment as vigour, and as the enterprize which was preparing against Quebec did not leave them a force so consider∣able as they had there in the pre∣ceding campaign, they abandoned their fort in the night, having da∣maged <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 7.</NOTE> it as much as they could, and retired to Crown Point.</P>
<P>General Amherst immediately set himself about repairing the fortifi∣cations of this post, which effectu∣ally secured the Lake George; covered our colonies, and was of such vast importance to enable him to push forward his offen∣sive operations, or to favour his retreat in case of a reverse of for∣tune. The only loss of any con∣sequence which the English army suffered, in making this valuable acquisition, was the death of Col. Townsend, who was killed in re∣connoitring by a shot from the fort. The steady bravery, the promising genius, and the agreeable manners of this officer, caused this loss to be considered as a very great one. They compared this melancholy e∣vent with the death of Lord Howe; they remembered how much these young soldiers resembled each other, both in their virtues and in the circumstances of their fate. Both dear to the troops, and having both lost their lives on an expedition a∣gainst this place.</P>
<P>Although the general had reason to imagine, that the same reasons which had induced the enemy to abandon their fort and lines at Ti∣conderoga, would persuade them also to relinquish Crown Point; he took all his measures with the same care, as if he expected an obstinate defence at the fort, and an attempt to surprize him on his march. He re∣membered how fatal security had proved to us in that part of the world upon many occasions.</P>
<P>The French abandoned the fort as it had been foreseen. The ge∣neral retired with about three thou∣sand five hundred men to the bot∣tom of Lake Champlain, and posted himself at the island called Isle du Noix. He was still pretty strong on the lake, having several armed boats and sloops, with which he hoped to prevent the progress of the English into the interior parts of Canada. Amherst as soon as he had taken possession of Crown Point, used every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14.</NOTE> endeavour to attain a naval superi∣ority on the lake, and in the mean time began to fortify this post as he had that at Ticonderoga. To this time the French were actually esta∣blished in the heart of our territo∣ries; so that during a war of three years, we had in effect been only acting on the defensive. It was on the day on which Mr. Amherst took
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
possession of Crown Point, that he received the agreeable news of the reduction of Niagara by the troops under Sir William Johnson; and he had the pleasure and encourage∣ment of seeing two of the great ob∣jects of the campaign accomplished, whilst he prepared himself to co-o∣perate in the accomplishment of the third, which was to be decisive of the whole. The body which had been appointed for Niagara under General Prideaux, without any ac∣cident arrived at the fort, which lies at the bottom of the lake to∣wards the south-west.</P>
<P>This is without exception the most important post in America, and secures the greatest number of com∣munications. For it is situated at the very entrance of a streight, by which the Lake Ontario is joined to that of Erie, which is connected with the other three great seas of fresh water, by the course of the vast river St. Laurence, which runs through them all, and carries off their superfluous waters to the ocean. A little above the fort is the cataract of Niagara, which is esteemed the most remarkable in the world, for the quantity of wa∣ter and the greatness of the fall. This fall would interrupt the com∣merce between the lakes, but for a road which the French have made up the hilly country that lies by the streight; so that there is here a good carrying-place, and not very tedious; for after a portage of about eight miles you reimbark again, and proceed without any interrupti∣on to the Lake Erie.</P>
<P>As the great communication of those who go by water is along this streight, and carrying place, so those who travel by land are obliged to cross it. The lakes are so disposed, that without a somewhat hazardous voyage, the Indians cannot any o∣therwise pass from the north-west to the south-east parts of North-Ame∣rica for many hundred miles. The fort of Niagara thus naturally com∣mands all the Five Nations, and all those Indian tribes that lie to the northward of the lakes, as well as those that are scattered along the banks of the Ohio, Ouabache and Missisippi, and according as it is pos∣sessed by the English or the French, connects or disjoints the colonies of Canada and Louisiana, protects or lays open our own, and is in all respects of so much consequence, that it was the opinion of persons the most conversant in American business, that this attempt ought to have been made much earlier; and that if such an attempt made at such a time had succeeded, it would have contributed very much to the secu∣rity of those parts of our colonies which were the most exposed, and would have at the same time greatly facilitated all our offensive measures, and shortened the war.</P>
<P>From the time that the French were acquainted with this place, they were fully possessed with an o∣pinion of its importance, both with regard to commerce and to domi∣nion They made several attempts to establish themselves here; but the Indians, who seemed more sensible of the consequences than we were, constantly opposed it. They obli∣ged them to relinquish a fort which they had built, and guarded this spot for a long time with a very se∣vere and prudent jealousy.</P>
<P>But whilst we neglected, confi∣ding in our strength, to cultivate the Indians, and the French sensible of their weakness, omitted no endea∣vour to gain these savage people to
<PB N="109" REF="122"/>
their interests, and they prevailed at last, under the name of a trading house, to erect a strong fort at the mouth of the streight, on the very best harbour, not only on this but on any of the lakes; an harbour which is safe from every wind, and open for the whole year. A French officer, an able and enterprising man, had been a prisoner among the Iroquois for a long time, and having, according to their custom, been naturalised, he grew extreme∣ly popular amongst them, and at last acquired his liberty. He com∣municated to the then governor of Canada, the plan of an establish∣ment at Niagara, and he himself undertook to execute it. He re∣turned amongst the Iroquois, and pretending great love for their na∣tion, which was now his own, told them that he would gladly come to make frequent visits to his brethren; but it was proper for that purpose, that they should allow him to build an house, where he might live at ease, and according to his own manner: at the same time he pro∣posed to them advantages in trade from this establishment. A request which seemed a compliment to those to whom it was made, was readily granted. The house was built. By degrees this house ex∣tended itself; it was strengthened by various additions; and it grew at last to a regular fortress, which has ever since awed the Five Nations, and checked our colonies.</P>
<P>The siege of this place had not been long formed <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20.</NOTE> before general Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn. As soon as this accident happened, which threatened to throw a damp on the operations, an express was sent to General Am∣herst, who always attentive to the service, lost no time to send an officer of character to command in his place. But the command which in the interim devolved upon Sir William Johnson, could not have been better bestowed. He omitted nothing to continue the vigorous measures of the late general, and added to them every thing his own genius could suggest. Respected by the regular troops, dear to the provincials, almost adored by the Indians, possessed of that genius for acquiring popularity amongst all kinds of men, and that versatile disposition, which we so seldom see united with disinterestedness and integrity, he employed those talents solely for the benefit of his country. The troops remembering that it was under that general, the first advantage had been obtained over the French, pushed on the siege with so much alacrity, that in a few days they had brought their approaches within an hundred yards of the covered way.</P>
<P>The French were alarmed at the imminent danger of this interesting place. They therefore collected all the regular troops and provincials, which they could draw from all their posts about the lakes, and to those joined a large body of savages, in order to give the English battle, and to raise the siege. They amount∣ed in all to 1700 men.</P>
<P>When General Johnson was ap∣prized of their approach, he order∣ed his light insantry, supported by some grenadiers and regular foot, to take post on the road to his left, by which the French were to take their route. He placed his Indians on his flanks. Whilst he took mea∣sures to receive the French, who came to relieve the place, he posted
<PB N="110" REF="123"/>
a strong body in such a manner, as to secure his trenches from any at∣tempt of the garrison during an engagement.</P>
<P>In this disposition he waited to receive the ene∣my. <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> At nine in the morning the engagement began by a violent and horrid scream of the enemies savages, according to their barba∣rous custom. It was this scream, perhaps the most horrid sound that can, be imagined, which is said to have struck a panick into the troops of General Braddock, and was one of the principal causes of that de∣feat, by which our endeavours in America were so long frustrated; but on this occasion it had no effect. The enemy was so well received by the troops in front, and by the Indians on their flanks, that in less than an hour's time their whole army was ruined. The pursuit was hot and bloody; and it continued for five miles. Seventeen officers were made prisoners, among whom were the first and second in com∣mand.</P>
<P>This action was fought in sight of the fort; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> it was no sooner concluded in favour of our troops, than the general summoned the garrison to surrender; sending in a list of the prisoners, and remonstrating on the ill effects of their holding out longer, particularly with regard to the Indians. The capitulation was signed that night. The garrison, consisting of about 600 men, sur∣rendered prisoners of war, and were conducted to New-York. The fort and stores were given up to the English troops.</P>
<P>This was the second very im∣portant service performed by Ge∣neral Johnson in this war, and a second time he had the good fortune to make the commander in chief of the enemy his pri∣soner. It must not be omitted to the honour of this gentleman, that though he was not regularly bred a soldier, the most compleat officer could not have made more excellent dispositions for the battle, or have conducted the siege from the beginning to the end, with a more cool and steady resolution, or with a more compleat knowledge of all the necessary manoeuvres of war. The taking of Niagara broke off effectually that communication, so much talked of and so much dreaded, between Canada and Louisiana, and by this stroke, one of the capital political designs of the French, which gave occa∣sion to the present war, was de∣feated in its direct and immediate object.</P>

<P>THE consequences which at∣tended the reduction of the fort of Niagara, as well as those upon Lake Champlain, were very interesting; but the great and cen∣tral operation to which all the rest tended, and to which even those were to be only subservient, was that against Quebec, the capital of Canada; and as this was to be the decisive stroke, it was proper that the greatest force should have been employed against it. If we reckon the maritime force, there is no doubt that we employed a greater number of men against Quebec, than against the Champlain forts; but the land forces, from some cause, fell much short of the num∣ber originally proposed, for they did not exceed 7000 men, regu∣lars and provincials, though the original plan intended 9000 for that expedition, independent of the junction of those under General Amherst, whose assistance on the occasion was taken for granted. In this expedition General Wolfe com∣manded the land forces. The fleet was under Admiral Saunders.</P>
<P>The whole embarkation <NOTE PLACE="marg">26th.</NOTE> arrived in the latter end of June at the Isle of Orleans, a few leagues from Quebec, without any accident whatsoever, notwithstand∣ing the ill fame of the river St. Laurence, and the reports of its dangerous navigation, probably spread for political purposes. They landed upon the Isle of Orleans, which is formed by the branches of the river St. Laurence. This island is about twenty miles in length, and seven or eight in breadth, highly cultivated, and affording every kind of refreshment to the soldiers and sailors after their tedious voyage.</P>
<P>As this island extends quite up to the bason of Quebec, it was ne∣cessary to possess it in order to act against the town; for the most westerly point of this island ad∣vances towards an high point of land on the continent, called Point Levi. Both of these shut up the view of the northern and southern channel, which environ the isle of Orleans, so that the harbour of Quebec appears to be a bason land∣locked upon all sides. The possession of both these points were necessary, as they might be employed either with great advantage against the town, or much to the annoyance of the besiegers; for whilst the enemy continued masters of those, it was impossible for a ship to lie in the harbour of Quebec. When these posts were possessed, which was done with little difficulty, the harbour and town of Quebec ap∣peared full to the view, at once a tempting and a discouraging sight.
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
For no place seems possessed of greater benefits of nature; nor none of which nature seems more to have consulted the defence.</P>
<P>Quebec, says F. Charlevoix, can boast of a fresh water harbour, ca∣pable of containing an hundred men of war of the line, at one hun∣dred and twenty leagues distance from the sea. It lies on the most navigable river in the universe. The river St. Laurence up to the Isle of Orleans, that is for about a hun∣dred and twelve leagues from its mouth, is no where less than from four to five leagues broad; but above that isle it narrows, so that before Quebec it is not above a mile over. Hence this place got the name of Quebeis or Quebec, which, in the Algonquin tongue, signifies a strait.</P>
<P>The city is the seat of the go∣vernor and the intendant, and the supreme tribunals of justice for all the French North America; it is also an episcopal see, and a place of considerable trade. It is large in extent, and elegant in many of its buildings both public and pri∣vate. It consists of an upper and lower town; the lower, which is narrow, is built upon a strand, at the foot of a lofty rock, upon which the upper town stands. This rock extends itself, and continues with a bold and steep front, westward along the river St. Laurence for a considerable way. Another river from the north-west, called St. Charles, falls here into the former, washing the foot of the rock on which Quebec stands; the point on which the town is built thus be∣comes a sort of peninsula by the junction of these rivers; so that whoever attacks Quebec, must ei∣their make his approaches above the town, and overcome the precipice which I have mentioned, or cross the river St. Charles, and attempt it upon that side. The former of those methods must appear to a prudent commander wholly unad∣viseable, and the latter extremely difficult. If the former method should be attempted they would have that dangerous precipice to overcome, defended by the enemies whole force, which the attack would draw to this quarter. On the other hand the country from the river St. Charles to the northward, for more than five miles, is ex∣tremely rough, broken and diffi∣cult, full of rivulets, gullies, and ravines, and so continues to the river of Montmorenci, which flows by the foot of a steep and woody hill. On the side of the river St. Laurence is a bank of sand of great extent, which prohibits the ap∣proach of any considerable vessel.</P>
<P>In this advantageous situation was the French army posted, upon what was deemed the only ac∣cessible side of Quebec, all along from the river St. Charles to that of Montmorenci, entrenched at every attackable spot, with the river and sandbank above-mention∣ed in their front, and thick impe∣netrable woods upon their rear. It is impossible to imagine a stronger post; a post at once more defensible in itself, or better calculated for suc∣couring the city, on which side soever it should be attacked. Thus posted, they greatly exceeded in number the besiegers, being about ten thousand men, under an able, and hitherto fortunate commander, M. de Montcalm, who, though he was superior in number to the En∣glish, resolved to risque nothing, and wisely relied on the natural strength of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="126"/>
When Wolfe saw the situation of the town, the nature of the country, the number of the troops, and their position, though of a sanguine tem∣per and highly adventurous, he began to despair; but, however another commander might have thought in∣action in such circumstances justified to himself, or even to the world, by such strong appearances, Wolfe re∣solved to leave nothing unattempted, but amidst the choice of difficulties which lay before him, to pitch upon those where the valour of his troops might be employed with the best prospect of success.</P>
<P>As soon as he had secured the west point of the isle of Orleans, and that of Levi, he erected batteries there of cannon and mortars, on the high ground, from the point of Levi, which looks towards the town; these fired continually upon the place; Admiral Saunders was stationed be∣low in the north channel of the isle of Orleans, opposite to Montmorenci; Admiral Holmes was stationed a∣bove the town, at once to distract the enemies attention, and to prevent any attempts from the enemy against the batteries that played upon the town.</P>
<P>After this wise disposition was made of the fleet, General Wolfe caused the troops to be transported over the north channel of the river St. Lau∣rence, to the north-east of Montmo∣renci, with a view of passing that ri∣ver, and bringing the enemy to an engagement. Some heights which commanded the enemies intrench∣ments, and a ford above, and another below the falls, encouraged him to this attempt; but, upon reconnoitring the ground, the opposite shore was found so steep and woody, that he could not hope to put his design in execution, which was by moving to∣wards the enemies flank, to draw them to an engagement. To bring the French to an action was his single ob∣ject. He had found that any attempts to assault the city would prove to no purpose, whilst the fleet could only batter the lower town, and must suf∣fer greatly by the cannon and bombs of the upper, whilst they were em∣ployed in this ineffectual service; for after the reduction of the lower town, the passages to the upper were ex∣tremely steep, and moreover so well entrenched, that this advantage would prove little towards the reduction of the place.</P>
<P>The only point left therefore, was by every means to entice or force the enemy to an engagement; and to this end no means were omitted, by sending detachments up the ri∣ver, and by every appearance of a design to attack the town on that side. But the Marquis de Montcalm, in chusing his post, was well ap∣prised of its importance. He knew sufficiently the nature of the coun∣try up the river, and he trusted to it; and therefore kept himself close∣ly in his post, disposing his parties of savages, in which he was very strong, in such a manner, as to make any attempt upon him by surprize absolutely impossible. In the mean time, from the town, fireships and boats were let down the stream to destroy the shipping, which, as they almost wholly filled the channel, were greatly endangered. But by the extraordinary skill and vigilance of Admiral Saunders, every vessel of this kind sent against them was towed ashore without doing the least mischief.</P>
<P>The general finding that all his efforts to decoy the enemy to an en∣gagement had proved unsuccessful, and, sensible that they desired no∣thing more than to act defensively,
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
until the season itself should fight for them and oblige the English to re∣tire, he came at last, in spite of all difficulties, to the resolution of at∣tacking them in their entrenchments on the side of Montmorenci. The place where the attack was to be made, was chosen with great judge∣ment, as the only place thereabouts in which the artillery could be brought into use; as there, and there only, the greatest part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once, and that there the retreat in case of a repulse was secure, at least for a certain time of the tide. Having determined upon the place where the attack was to be, which was at the mouth of the river Mont∣morenci, the best dispositions for it <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30.</NOTE> were made, both on the part of the admiral and of the general. But notwithstanding that the whole was conducted with equal vigour and prudence, it was totally defeated by one of those ac∣cidents which so frequently interpose to the disgrace of human wisdom, and which demonstrates that she is far from being the sole arbitress of war.</P>
<P>The English grenadiers, who led the attack, had orders, immediately after their landing, to form them∣selves on the beach; but instead of forming themselves as they were di∣rected, from the hurry and noise of their landing, or from an ill-govern∣ed ardor, they rushed impetuously towards the enemies entrenchments in the utmost disorder and confusion, without waiting for the corps which were to sustain them, and join in the attack. In this disorder, they were met by a violent and steady fire from the entrenchments, by which they were thrown into more confu∣sion, and obliged them to shelter themselves behind a redoubt, which the French had abandoned on their approach.</P>
<P>The general perceiving that it was impossible for these grenadiers to form under so severe a fire, that the night drew on, a violent tempest was gathering, and the tide began to make, saw clearly that he had no∣thing further left, than to order a retreat, with as little disadvantage as possible. He therefore called off those troops, and having formed them behind Brigadier Monkton's corps, which was on the beach in excellent order, the whole repassed the river without molestation, the general exposing his person with that intrepidity, which distinguished him both during the attack, and the re∣treat.</P>
<P>The loss in this check was not inconsiderable; and the event on the whole was such, as to discou∣rage any further attempts upon that side. They returned to the old measures. The general again sent some bodies above the town, and some men of war sailed up the stream for more than twelve leagues. They received intelligence that the enemy had amassed some magazines of provisions in the interior country, and they proposed by getting be∣tween them and the town, to draw the French army from their entrench∣ments, to the long-desired engage∣ment; but if they failed to compass this, they might at least destroy the ships of war which the enemy had in the river, and help to open a com∣munication between them and Gene∣ral Amherst, on whom their last ex∣pectations were fixed, and who, they flattered themselves, was on his march to their assistance.</P>
<P>But though they succeeded in de∣stroying some of the enemies maga∣zines, there was nothing of great mo∣ment
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
in this. They could not come near the men of war. However they received intelligence from some prisoners, of the success of Sir Wil∣liam Johnson against Niagara; they learned likewise, that the French had smoothed the difficulties in the way of General Amherst, by abandoning Crown Point and Ticonderoga. But this intelligence, otherwise so pleas∣ing, brought them no prospect of the approach of any assistance from that quarter. The season wasted apace. The general fell violently ill, consumed by care, watching, and a fatigue, too great to be supported by a delicate constitution, and a body unequal to that vigorous and enterprising soul that it lodged. It was not enough for him to escape from so great an expedition uncon∣demned and unapplauded; to be pitied, was he thought but a milder censure; and he knew that no mili∣tary conduct can shine, unless it be gilded with success. His own high notions, the public hope, the good success of other commanders, all turned inward upon him, op∣pressed his spirits, and converted disappointment into disease. As soon as he had a little recovered, he dis∣patched an express with an account of his proceedings to England, writ∣ten indeed in the stile of desponden∣cy, but with such perspicuity, clear∣ness, and elegance, as would have ranked him among our best writers, if his military exploits had not placed him among our greatest com∣manders.</P>
<P>He resolved, when he sent away his account, to continue the cam∣paign to the last possible moment; and after a deliberation with his offi∣cers, determined, that any further attempts at Montmorenci were to little purpose, and that their princi∣pal operations should be above the town, in order, if possible, to draw the enemy to an action. But the design of Wolfe was deeper, and more particularly directed than it had been before. The camp at Mont∣morenci was broke up, and the troops were conveyed to the south∣east of the river, and encamped at Point Levi. The squadron under Admiral Holmes made movements up the river for several days succes∣sively, in order to draw the enemies attention as far from the town as possible. This succeeded in some measure; for, though it could not persuade the Marquis de Montcalm to quit his post, it induced him to detach M. de Bougainville with 1500 men to watch their motions, and to proceed along the western shore of the river, whilst the English army di∣rected its march the same way on the eastern bank.</P>
<P>When General Wolfe saw that matters were ripe for action, he or∣dered the ships under Admiral Saun∣ders to make a feint, as if they pro∣posed to attack the French in their entrenchments, on the Beauport shore below the town, and by their motions to give this feint all the appearance of a reality which it possibly could have. This disposition being made below the town, the general em∣barked his forces about one in the morning, and with Admiral Holmes's division went three leagues further up the river than the intended place of his landing, in order to amuse the enemy, and conceal his real design. Then he put them into boats, and fell down silently with the tide, un∣observed by the French centinels posted along the shore. The rapi∣dity of the current carried these boats a little below the intended place of attack. The ships followed
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
them, and arrived just at the time which had been concerted to cover their landing. Considering the dark∣ness of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation, and it required excellent heads both on the part of the marine, and the land service, to preserve a communication, and to prevent a discovery and confusion.</P>
<P>As the troops could not land at the spot proposed, when they were put on shore an hill appeared before them extremely high and steep in its ascent; a little path winded up this ascent, so narrow that two could not go abreast. Even this path was in∣trenched, and a captain's guard de∣fended it. These difficulties did not abate the hopes of the general, or the ardor of the troops. The light infantry under Colonel Howe laying hold of stumps and boughs of trees, pulled themselves up, dislodged the guards, and cleared the path; and then all the troops surmounting every difficulty, gained the top of the hill, and as fast as they ascended formed themselves, so that they were all in order of battle at day break.</P>
<P>Montcalm when he heard that the English had ascended the hill, and were formed on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> the high ground at the back of the town, scarcely credited the intelli∣gence, and still believed it to be a feint to induce him to abandon that strong post, which had been the ob∣ject of all the real attempts that had been made since the beginning of the campaign. But he was soon, and fatally for him, undeceived. He saw clearly that the English fleet and army were in such a situation, that the upper and lower town might be attacked in concert, and that nothing but a battle could possibly save it. Accordingly he determined to give them battle, and quitting Beauport passed the river St. Charles, and formed his troops opposite to ours.</P>
<P>He filled the bushes that were in his front with detachments of Indians and his best marksmen, to the num∣ber of about 1500; his regular forces formed his left; his right was composed of the troops of the colony, supported by two battalions of regu∣lars. The rest of the Indians and Canadians extended on that side, and attempted to outflank the left of the English, which was formed to pre∣vent that design, in a manner which the military men call <HI>Potence;</HI> that is, in a body which presents two faces to the enemy. Here Brigadier General Townshend commanded six regiments, and the Louisbourg gre∣nadiers were disposed in a line to the right of this body, extending to the river. A regiment was drawn up behind the right for a reserve. It was formed in eight subdivisions with large intervals. The light in∣fantry under Colonel Howe protected the rear and the left. The disposi∣tions on both sides were judicious, and the engagement on both sides began with spirit.</P>
<P>The English troops were exhorted to reserve their fire; and they bore that of the enemies light troops in front, which was galling, though ir∣regular, with the utmost patience and good order, waiting for the main body of the enemy, which advanced fast upon them. At forty yards distance our troops gave their fire, which took place in its full extent, and made a terrible havoc among the French. It was supported with as much vivacity as it was begun, and the enemy every where yielded to it; but just in the moment when the fortune of the field began to declare itself, General Wolfe, in whose life every thing seemed in∣cluded,
<PB REF="130" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Major General; JAMES WOLFE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="117" REF="131"/>
fell: General Monkton, the next to him in command, fell im∣mediately after, and both were con∣veyed out of the line; the com∣mand now devolved on General Townshend. It was at a very critical time. For, though the enemy be∣gan to fall back, and were much broken, the loss of the two generals was a very discouraging circumstance, and it required great temper and great exertions to support the advan∣tages that had been gained, and to push them to their proper extent. General Townshend shewed himself equal to so arduous a duty; the troops preserved their spirit, and each corps seemed to exert itself with a view to its peculiar character. The grenadiers with their bayonets, the Highlanders with their broad swords, and the rest of the forces, with a steady and continued fire, drove the enemy in great disorder from every post, and compleated their defeat. During the whole action, Colonel Howe with his light infantry covered the left wing in such a manner, as entirely to frustrate the attempts of the enemies Indians and Canadians upon that flank.</P>
<P>The field now seemed to be com∣pleatly decided, when a new enemy appeared, which threatened to bring on a fresh engagement, and to put all again to the hazard. M. de Bougainville, whom the feigned movements of the English troops had drawn up the river, turned back on discovering their real design, and now appeared on the rear of the army, with a body of 2000 men. But fortunately the main body of the French was by this time so broken and dispersed, that the general was able to establish his rear, and to turn such an opposition on that side, that the enemy retired after a very feeble attempt.</P>
<P>In this decisive action our troops lost about 500 men; on the side of the enemy at least 1500 were killed. But however glorious this victory was, and however important in its consequences, it must be admitted that it was very dearly bought. Soldiers may be raised; officers will be formed by experience; but the loss of a genius in war, is a loss which we know not how to repair. The death of Wolfe was indeed grievous to his country, but to himself the most happy that can be imagined; and the most to be envied by all those who have a true relish for mi∣litary glory. Unindebted to family, or connections, unsupported by in∣trigue or faction, he had accom∣plished the whole business of life at a time, when others are only begin∣ning to appear; and at the age of thirty-five, without feeling the weak∣ness of age or the vicissitude of for∣tune, having satisfied his honest am∣bition, having compleated his cha∣racter, having fulfilled the expecta∣tions of his country, he fell at the head of his conquering troops, and expired in the arms of victory.</P>
<P>The circumstances that attended the death of such a person, are too interesting to be passed over in silence, and they were indeed such as spoke the whole tenor of his life. He first received a wound in the head; but, that he might not discourage his troops, he wrapped it up in his kandkerchief, and en∣couraged his men to advance; soon after he received another ball in his belly; this also he dissembled, and exerted himself as before; when he received a third in his breast, under which he at last sunk, and suffered himself, unwillingly, to be carried behind the ranks. As he lay strug∣gling with the anguish and weakness
<PB N="118" REF="132"/>
of three grievous wounds, he seemed only sollicitous about the fortune of the battle. He begged one, who attended him, to support him to view the Field; but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed and confused his sight, he desired an officer, who was by him, to give him an account of what he saw. The officer answered, that the enemy seemed broken; he repeated his question a few minutes after with much anxiety, when he was told that the enemy was totally routed, and that they fled in all parts. Then, said he, "I am satisfied;" and imme∣diately he expired.</P>
<P>Without the same advantages, the enemy also had an heavy loss in this battle, which, no doubt, contri∣buted to their defeat. M. de Mont∣calm, commander in chief, was kil∣led on the spot; an officer who had done the highest services to his coun∣try throughout the whole American war, and perfectly supported his re∣putation in this last scene of it, hav∣ing made the most perfect dispositions that human prudence could suggest, both before the battle and in the en∣gagement. It is something remark∣able that in both armies, the first in command should be killed, and the second dangerously wounded. But General Monkton happily recovered, the French officer died a little after the battle.</P>
<P>Five days after the action, the enemy seeing that the communica∣tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 18.</NOTE> between the town and the army was cut off, and that the English fleet and troops were preparing with all vi∣gour for a siege, surrendered the city of Quebec upon terms of ho∣nour to the garrison, and advantage to the inhabitants, who were pre∣served in the free exercise of their religion, and the possession of their civil rights, until a general peace should decide their future condition. The fortifications of the city were in tolerable order; the houses almost totally demolished. A garrison of 5000 men under General Murray, were put into the place, with a plen∣ty of provisions and ammunition for the winter. The fleet sailed to Eng∣land soon after, fearing lest the setting in of the frosts should lock them up in the river St. Laurence.</P>
<P>Thus the capital of French A∣merica was rendered to the English, after a most severe campaign of near three months; and perhaps, if the whole be considered, there never was an enterprise of such difficulty carried on with a more gallant perseverance, or accomplished with more vigour and ability. A city strong in situa∣tion and fortifications, was to be at∣tacked. An army greatly superior in number to the besiegers, was posted under the walls of that city in an impregnable situation. That army was to be forced to a battle a∣gainst the inclinations of a wise and cautious commander. A theatre of more than five leagues was to be fil∣led, and operations of that extent to be carried on in the eye of the superior army, by less than 7000 men. In this contest with so many difficulties, one may say with nature itself, the genius of the commander shewed itself superior to every thing. All the dispositions to that daring but judicious attempt, near Sillery, which at last drew Montcalm from his entrenchments, were so many master pieces in the art of war. But it is certain, that these things, not∣withstanding the extraordinary abi∣lities of the general, could never have been compassed, had not the marine co-operated with an unani∣mity,
<PB N="119" REF="133"/>
diligence, and skill, which never could have taken place, but from that perfect love to their country, that animated all those that were concerned in this expe∣dition. Here was no murmuring nor discontent, nor absurd jealou∣sy; no mean competition between the land and sea-service; but the most zealous endeavours to second each others efforts, and the most generous inclinations on each side, to give a due praise to their mutual services.</P>
<P>When the news of this decisive action arrived in England, we all remember, though it is very diffi∣cult to describe, the various and mixed emotions with which every one was affected. But two days before this came, was received the express which General Wolfe had sent off after the affair of Montmo∣renci. When, the general doubted, the public thought they had reason to despair. But whilst this gloom was fresh and in the midst of the general despondency, a second ex∣press arrives, and brings all at once an account of the victory, the taking of Quebec, and the death of Gene∣ral Wolfe. The effect of so joyful news, immediately on such a dejec∣tion, and then the mixture of grief and pity, which attended the public congratulations and applauses, was very singular and affecting. The sort of mourning triumph, that ma∣nifested itself on that occasion, did equal honour to the memory of the general, and to the humanity of the nation.</P>
<P>A little circumstance was talked of at that time, and it deserves to be recorded, as it shews a fineness of sentiment, and a justness of thinking, in the lower kind of people, that is rarely met with even amongst persons of education. The mother of General Wolfe was an object marked out for pity by great and peculiar distress; the pub∣lic wound pierced her mind with a particular affliction, who had expe∣rienced the dutiful son, the ami∣able domestic character, whilst the world admired the accomplished officer. Within a few months she had lost her husband; she now lost this son, her only child. The po∣pulace of the village where she lived unanimously agreed to admit no illuminations or firings, or any other sign of rejoycing whatsoever near her house, lest they should seem by an ill-timed triumph, to insult over her grief. There was a justness in this, and whoever knows the people, knows that they made no small sacrifice on this oc∣casion.</P>
<P>The nation, which never suffers any public service to pass unre∣warded, proceeded to honour the merits of the living and of the dead. The minister himself made the motion for this purpose in the house of commons, and all the force of eloquence was dis∣played in setting off these services in their proper light. A magnifi∣cent monument was voted for the deceased general in Westminster Ab∣bey; the living generals and admi∣rals received the greatest of honours, the thanks of their country, by their representatives.</P>
<P>It is not known with certainty in what manner the French dis∣posed of the remainder of their army after the battle of Quebec. It is probable that they retired to∣wards Montreal and Trois Rivieres, the only places of any consequence which they have left in Canada. In order to deprive them of sub∣sistence
<PB N="120" REF="134"/>
in any attempt they might be induced to make towards the recovery of Quebec in the winter, the country along the river was laid waste for a very considerable extent. A measure, which for the sake of humanity, we could have wished not to have been found ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>Whilst the operations were thus successfully carried on in the river St. Laurence, General Amherst was not wanting in his endeavours on the side of Lake Champlain. Though the retreat of the French from Crown Point and Ticonderoga had left him entirely master of Lake George, he found that the command of Lake Champlain was still an ob∣ject of some difficulty. Mr. Bourle∣maque, who commanded in that part, had retired to the Isle de Noix, at the bottom of the lake, where he had three thousand five hundred men strongly entrenched; he had like∣wise four stout armed sloops, by which he could easily defeat any at∣tempt by boats.</P>
<P>General Amherst found it ne∣cessary to attain a naval superiority upon the Champlain, before he could hope to push his operations any further; but this was a work of so much time, that it made it absolutely impossible to attain the great end of the campaign, the communication with General Wolfe, who was left in the man∣ner we have seen to the exertion of his single strength. The naval preparations were not perfectly ac∣complished before the 10th of October. They consisted of a great radeau, eighty four feet in length, and twenty in breadth, which car∣ried six twenty-four pounders; the rest consisted of a brigantine and a sloop.</P>
<P>Covered by these the army was embarked in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> boats in a most excellent disposition, and proceeded a considerable way upon the lake; but as the season was far advanced, and the wea∣ther growing cold and tempestuous, he judged it highly dangerous to venture his troops much upon the water in open batteaux; for the waves run as high on this lake as at sea in an hard gale of wind. Besides, he could not hope at this advanced season to act at such a distance as the Isle de Noix with any effect; he therefore wisely postponed his opera∣tions on that side to another year, and contented himself for the pre∣sent with the efforts of his little ma∣rine, which exerted itself with great activity; they blocked up two of the enemies strongest vessels in a bay, but the French a∣bandoned them in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 15.</NOTE> night, and sunk them in a deep wa∣ter, the crews making their escape; these they were in hopes to weigh up. The French appearing no where to oppose them, the arm∣ed sloops returned to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 21.</NOTE> Crown Point soon after the troops, which were disposed in winter quarters.</P>
<P>The memorable and vigorous campaign of 1759, which made full amends for the inactivity of the former, was thus happily closed. By the taking of Niagara, Ticon∣deroga, and above all Quebec, the French, in the little remaining part of Canada, are invested upon every side. The troops which they have under Mr. Levy at Montreal, and those under Mr. Bourlemaque at Isle de Noix, can neither be re∣cruited with men, nor properly supplied with military stores, all communication with France being cut off. So that in the opening of

the next campaign, if they are at∣tacked with vigour from the side of Quebec, whilst General Amherst advances with his body by Lake Champlain, of which he has now the entire dominion, the resistance will be no more than sufficient to give reputation to the conquest; and it will depend more upon our own sentiments of convenience what part of North America we shall leave to France, than to any efforts they may make in that part of the world; happy if our Eu∣ropean system should so far concur, as to leave us free to conclude a peace in America upon its own me∣rits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Prince Henry's march into Saxony. General Vehla defeated. King of Prussia enters Saxony. Prussians defeated at Maxen. Again defeated at Meissen. M. Daun occupies the camp at Pirna. Munster surrenders to the allies. Hereditary Prince of Brunswick defeats the Duke of Wurtemburg at Fulda. March of the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick to Saxony.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE took notice, in the preced∣ing part of our narrative, of that movement of the King of Prussia, by which he got between the Russians and Great Glogau, and thereby baffled their design upon that important place. This move∣ment, at once daring, prudent and necessary, hindered the Rus∣sians from taking winter quarters in his dominions; but at the same time it unavoidably cut off all com∣munication with the army of Prince Henry.</P>
<P>That Prince, seeing that he could not second the operations of the King, his brother, on the side of Silesia, contrived another expedient of co-operating with him, which was immediately to direct his march towards Saxony. There was no object, the possession of which was more interesting; on that account it was very proper; but this march answered also another end; for it drew the attention of M. Daun to the side of Saxony, and disabled him from assisting the designs of the Russians against Glogau, either with his whole army, or with any considerable detachment from it. The whole country of Lusatia, through which this projected march lay, was in a manner overspread with the enemy. M. Daun, with the main army of the Austrians, lay at a place called Sorau, opposite to the Prince's camp. Five bodies of Russians occupied as many ad∣vantageous posts between the Bober and the Neiss. General Laudohn possessed the whole country along the Spree, with several Austrian corps. To get round M. Daun, it was necessary to make a vast circuit, and to march between the Austrian and Russian armies for more than sixty English miles.</P>
<P>Before the Prince entered upon this arduous design, by several bold movements he obliged M. Daun to retreat from Sorau to Gor∣litz, and from Gorlitz as far as Bautzen, keeping himself as much as possible between the Prince and Saxony. But his Royal Highness, having perceived the direction in which M. Daun was moving, made
<PB N="122" REF="138"/>
a compass to the northward of the Austrians, into the Lower Lusatia, passed the Neiss at Rothenburg, and marching with the utmost expedi∣tion arrived at Hoyers Werda in two days from his leaving his posts near Zittau. This <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 25.</NOTE> rapid march brought them quite un∣expected upon a body of five or six thousand Austrian irregulars, com∣manded by General Vehla, who were situated in all security behind the town. They were routed with no small slaughter. Having dis∣lodged this corps, the Prince's army had leisure to repose themselves af∣ter such a fatiguing march, for two days; and then continued their pro∣gress towards the Elbe, which river they crossed at Torgau, hav∣ing received notice that M. Daun <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 2.</NOTE> had crossed it before them near Dresden. Thus was the grand theatre of the war once more trans∣ferred into Saxony, and that misera∣ble country, continually harassed, continually tossed from hand to hand, the sport of violence and fortune, suffered equal distresses from its deli∣verers and its enemies.</P>
<P>The Prussian army, from the be∣ginning of this war, has been par∣ticularly distinguished for its marches; and there is certainly nothing in all the various operations of war, which more particularly distinguishes good troops, and able and spirited leaders. But this march of Prince Henry, over such a tract of country, almost every where occupied by the enemy, in so short a time, and with so little loss, is perhaps one of the most ex∣traordinary, and the best conducted, of the marches that have been made by the Prussian, or any other army.</P>
<P>This fortunate stroke, together with the retreat of the Russians, afforded some hope, that notwith∣standing his repeated disasters, the King of Prussia might still conclude the campaign to his advantage. The detachments under Finck and Wunsch had no sooner entered Misnia, than they attained a superio∣rity over the united armies of Au∣stria and the empire; all the places which in so short a time they had seized, in as short a time were re∣duced to the obedience of their for∣mer masters. Wunsch had engaged their army, and defeated one of its wings. This victory gave them the possession of every thing to the gates of Dresden, the only town which remained to the enemy of all those they had taken. They found them∣selves unable to prevent Prince Henry from passing the Elbe; they found themselves unable to prevent Gene∣ral Hulsen from coming to his re∣lief with a considerable detach∣ment; they found themselves un∣able to prevent the King from joining himself to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 12.</NOTE> those; when, after obliging the Rus∣sians to evacuate Silesia, he marched to their relief, leaving General It∣zenplitz, with a part of his army, to keep the Russians from availing themselves of his absence. On this the army of the empire retired. M. Daun fell back towards Dresden. All the King of Prussia's posts were left unmolested, and after all his losses, and all his necessary detach∣ments, he still saw himself at the head of a gallant army of sixty thousand men, in high spirits, and ready to execute the most desperate of his orders, notwithstanding the advanced season, and the great ex∣tremity of the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="139"/>
It is true, that M. Daun was su∣perior to him in numbers, and yet more so in situation. He could at any time take possession of the fa∣mous camp at Pirna, where he could not be attacked with any prospect of success; but then the freezing of the Elbe, the snow on the mountains which divide Bohemia from Saxony, and the continual molestations which might be expected from the Prussian parties, made this situation as dan∣gerous, in some respects, as it was desirable in others.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of many, that these advantages on the side of the King of Prussia, well pursued with∣out aiming at more, would in a short time infallibly have obliged M. Daun to relinquish his strong post, and to retire into Bohemia, abandoning Dresden, and with it all the fruits of his victorious campaign. But the King, possessed by an idea of the ill situation of the Austrians, thought that advantages of greater moment, and more decisive, might be drawn from it. He knew, that the passes into Bohemia were so dif∣ficult, that by some posts properly chosen and strongly guarded, the subsistence of the Austrians might be made impracticable, and that even their retreat rendered so difficult, that M. Daun would find himself compelled to fight at a disadvantage, and to put to the hazard of the field, all that his caution and prudence had been so long and so painfully procuring.</P>
<P>Upon this plan the King, having obliged M. Daun to retreat as far as Plauen, advanced himself as far as Kesseldorf; and ordered General Finck, with a strong corps, to turn the Austrians, and seize the defiles of Maxen and Ottendorf, through which alone it seemed possible for the Austrians to communicate with Bohemia. This was so successfully executed, that there appeared no doubt that the King had effectual∣ly secured one of his principal ob∣jects, and had placed Daun between two fires.</P>
<P>Whilst the Prussians enjoyed this security, M. Daun, who was aware of their design, had so occupied all the eminences about this rough and dangerous place, and all the passes into it, that the Prussians were hard∣ly attacked, when their defeat seem∣ed inevitable. It is probable that they had got too far into these defiles, and had not taken proper measures to secure a retreat, or any sort of com∣munication with the grand army. They became too late sensible of their situation, and they made, for a whole day, the most intrepid efforts to disengage themselves from it; but they were foiled in every attempt, with considerable loss of men, and of the most part of their artillery.</P>
<P>Night put a stop to the engage∣ment; the Austrians employed it ef∣fectually, to entangle the Prussians, by guarding with double strength and vigilance, every avenue thro' which it was possible for them to escape. So that when the morning appeared, they saw the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26.</NOTE> hills covered upon every side with great bodies of their enemies, and every defile presented a wall of bayonets, through which it was im∣possible to penetrate. Thus galled with the losses of the preceding day, in which it is said they had exhaust∣ed almost all their ammunition, stripped of the greatest part of their cannon, surrounded by the enemy on all quarters, no resource, no pro∣spect of relief appearing, the army lost all hope, and all spirit. To make any efforts in this condition,
<PB N="124" REF="140"/>
General Finck thought would only be to throw away unprofitably the lives of many brave men, which might be reserved for a more hopeful occasion; he therefore, notwithstand∣ing the known rigour of his master, the apparent shame of the thing, and the thousand circumstances of em∣barrasment that must have arisen to a man of honour at such a juncture, came to a resolution of surrendering the whole army prisoners of war. Nineteen battalions and thirty-five squadrons, composing near twenty thousand men by the Austrian ac∣count, above twelve by the Prussian confession, sixty-four pieces of can∣non, many standards and colours were taken on this occasion.</P>
<P>It was unquestionably the greatest blow which the Prussians had felt from the beginning of the war; considering the critical time, the numbers taken, and the loss of re∣putation, which arose from the man∣ner in which they were taken. It is no wonder, that such an extraordina∣ry advantage, thus cheaply obtained, should greatly have elevated the friends of the house of Austria. They had put the cheat upon the Prus∣sians, they had caught their enemy in the very trap which they had laid, as they thought, with such address for them. They had now received a full indemnification for the cap∣ture of the Saxon army, which had surrendered in much the same man∣ner, and very near this place, in the year 1756.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia had not time to recover from this stroke, under which he was yet staggering, when he received another blow, and a se∣vere one. General Durceke was posted at the right of the Elbe, op∣posite to Meissen; but on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4.</NOTE> the approach of a large bo∣dy of Austrians, they prepared to re∣treat over the river into that place into which they thought their re∣treat secure; but having been obli∣ged by an hard frost to withdraw their bridge of boats, a thaw super∣vening, when they attempted to lay a bridge of pontoons, so many great fragments of ice floated in the river, that they found it impractica∣ble; they were therefore under the necessity of passing over their army in boats. Whilst they struggled with these difficulties, their rear guard was attacked by the Austrians with great fury, and all the men that composed it, together with the Ge∣neral, were killed or made prisoners. The loss of the Prussians on this oc∣casion is said to have been three thou∣sand killed and taken; and this se∣cond surprize brought a new discre∣dit, as well as a great detriment to the Prussian arms.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not so carried away with this flood of success, as to de∣part in the least degree from his usual cautious management. Two advantages were now obtained, which, with a very few efforts, might be improved, to the entire destruc∣tion of the King of Prussia. At least, many Generals would have thought so; but M. Daun thought that the same conduct, which, with no risque, and with little loss, had reduced the King so low, was the most likely, if pursued, to bring on his entire ruin. He resolved to give that monarch no sort of chance to recover his fortune; Daun, after the two great victories of the Rus∣sians his allies, after the two great victories he had himself newly ob∣tained, retired behind Dresden; and as if he had been beaten, as often as he was victorious, he took resuge in the impregnable camp at Pirna,
<PB N="125" REF="141"/>
having so disposed matters, that the King of Prussia, now too weak to send out any great detachments, could not prevent his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P>Whilst the King of Prussia carried on his unsuccessful campaign in Saxony, through all the rigours of the severest winter for many years felt in Europe; the army of the allies kept the field with better fortune. It is true, things had been so disposed by the obstinate resis∣tance of Munster, and the reinforce∣ments which arrived in the French army, that Prince Ferdinand did not find himself in a condition to force them to a decisive action; and there∣fore the situation of the two armies had continued much the same for a considerable time. At length Munster, after a series of opera∣tions, sometimes a siege, sometimes a blockade, now broken off, and now resumed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20.</NOTE> at last surrendered, and the garrison capitulated for their liberty.</P>
<P>Not long after this, the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, all whose en∣terprises are distinguished with a pe∣culiar eclat and splendor, that mark them for his own, performed a ser∣vice that curbed the French, even more than the loss of Munster. Prince Charles of Bevern was also engaged in this design.</P>
<P>The Duke of Wurtemburg had renewed his treaty of subsidy with France, and having recruited and augmented his troops, he lay at Fulda, a great way to the right of the French army. The Here∣ditary Prince formed a design to attack him at that distance.</P>
<P>On the 28th of November, taking a small, but well chosen corps of horse and foot, and disengaging them from their baggage, he arriv∣ed in two days at Fulda, where the Wurtemburgers enjoyed themselves in full security. A <HI>feu de joye</HI> had been ordered for that day; the troops were all in their best cloaths; the Duke had invited all the ladies in the town to his table, and to a ball, which he intended to have given that very day; but the Hereditary Prince disconcerted their measures, both of war and diversion. A large party of the Wurtemburg troops were posted in a plain before the town. The Hereditary Prince fell upon them unawares in their front and flank, and drove them in∣to the town, into which he closely pursued them. Here they made some appearance of maintaining their ground for some minutes, but they were soon drove out on the other side, and hotly pursued by the Prince of Brunswick; without the town they were met by Prince Charles of Bevern who had made a compass about the place, and attack∣ed them vigorously as soon as they had got out of it. Four battalions made some resistance, and were all cut to pieces or made prisoners; the rest, with the Duke himself cover∣ed by the resistance of these bat∣talions, made a shift to escape. Above a thousand prisoners were made no this occasion; and the Prince returned to the camp of the allies, after having effectually dis∣abled this corps from performing any thing considerable; and this ac∣tion was of the greatest consequence, as, by the disposition of that corps at Fulda, there was an appearance as if the French meant to form a communication with the army of the Empire, for the mutual extension and security of their winter quarters.</P>
<P>This enterprise was only the per∣lude to another, which promised to be much more extensive in its conse∣quences.
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
The season was now grown too severe to suffer the allies to push any further the advantages they had obtained over the French; at the same time it disabled the French from attempting any thing considerable against them. Besides these advantages of the season, by possessing Munster, the allies were no longer obliged to keep so large a body of men in Westphalia. These were the considerations which suffered Prince Ferdinand to turn his eyes to the distressed state of the King of Prussia's affairs. After the two great blows which that monarch had suffered, there was no hope of dis∣lodging M. Duan with his single force; and he was utterly unable to avail himself as heretofore, of the rigour of the season, to strike a decisive blow. Prince Firdinand, distant as he was from his distressed ally, and so near to an enemy superior in numbers, did not hesitate to send him succours, to enable him, if possible, to make a final effort. He detached there∣fore 12,000 of his best men, and placed them under the command of the Hereditary Prince, with whose vigour and diligence he was perfect∣ly acquainted, and under whom he knew the soldiers would endure any hardship with chearfulness. They marched from Korsdorff, and in the depth of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> late severe season, without losing a man by sickness or desertion, in fif∣teen days, marched near three hun∣der miles, and joined the King of Prussia at Freybourg.</P>
<P>This junction raised for a while the spirits and hopes of the Prussian army, but, in effect, it did more honour to the abilities of the Here∣ditary Prince, than service to the King. The season which fought equally against all sides, the inacces∣sible camp at Pirna, and the caution of M. Daun, rendered it impossible to the King, notwithstanding this re∣inforcement, to make any attempt. So that after several movements in hopes of bringing the Austrains to an engagement, he was obliged at length to desist, and to suffer the shattered remains of his army to repose in winter quarters, after the fruitless fatigues of so long, so labo∣rious, and so bloody a campaign.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia did not derive the benefits that were expected from this detachment; the French had no sooner notice of it, than they at∣tempted to avail themselves of the weakness it caused in the allied army. The Duke of Broglio was now at the head of the French troops; he had lately returned from Versailles, having ruined the cha∣racter of M. de Contades, establish∣ed his own, removed his rival, and, in spite of seniority, had acquired the marshal's staff, and the command of the army. He thought he had now an opportuinty for an action of eclat to distinguish his entrance into command. He attempted to attack Prince Ferdinand by sur∣prise. But finding him <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 24.</NOTE> perfectly prepared, and all his posts well guarded, he thought it most prudent to retire to his former quar∣ters; and with this abortive attempt closed the operations of the German campaign, from whence France had entertained such sanguine hopes; leaving to Prince Ferdinand the glory of taking Munster in the presence of one of their armies, and of securing his own posts against all their efforts, after he had, from an inferior num∣ber, detached 12,000 men three hundred miles from his camp.</P>

Conclusion of the annals of</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>THE severity of the winter could not put a stop to the operations of the land armies; it had no more effect upon the opera∣tions at sea, which went on with vigour, in spite of the inclemency of the season. The invasion projected by France, which the engagement off Cape Lagos had retarded, was by no means laid aside.</P>
<P>The preparations for a naval equipment in the harbour of Brest, and for transporting a body of forces from Vannes, went on continually. The winter did not delay these pre∣parations, because it was hoped that in that season, the British fleet might be obliged to take refuge in their own harbours; and thus might afford on opportunity for the French fleet to come out unopposed, and to execute the object of their destination before the British navy could be in readiness to encounter them.</P>
<P>In fact, they were not wholly dis∣appointed in their expectations. A violent storm forced Sir Edward Hawke to quit his station off Brest. He came with his whole fleet to an∣chor in Torbay.</P>
<P>The French fleet avail∣ed itself of his absence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> to put to sea. The whole English nation was alarmed; but it was an alarm which produced no hurry or disturbance, but vigorous, cool, and settled methods for defence.</P>
<P>And now the event of the whole war was put to the issue; for upon the good or ill success of this stroke every thing depended. Admiral Hawke lost not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> a moment's time to put again to sea, and to seek the French fleet. Both squadrons put to sea on the same day; Sir Edward Hawke from Torbay, M. de Conflans from Brest. There was a difference of but one ship of the line in their forces.</P>
<P>It is impossible here to pass over the gallant behaviour of one of our Admirals, as it helps to mark the ge∣nius and spirit of this happy time, and as this is one of the finest instances of it. Admiral Saunders came into port from his Quebec expedition im∣mediately after Hawke had sailed. After such a long voyage and so se∣vere a campaign, unbroken by fa∣tigue, and still insatiated with glory, he determined immediately to set sail again, and partake the honour and danger of the coming engagement. For this purpose no time was to be lost, and he had no orders. But he thought the exigences of his country sufficient orders; and he knew that at this time the letter of military dis∣cipline would never be set against its spirit. He therefore set sail without waiting for orders with ten ships; but fortune did not favour the gene∣rosity of his intentions, and he did not join the British fleet time enough for the engagement.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward Hawke conclud∣ed that the first rendezvous of the enemy's fleet would be at Quiberon,
<PB N="128" REF="144"/>
he directed his course with all dili∣gence for that bay. But here again fortune for a while seemed to declare for the French; for a strong wind blown in an easterly point, drove the English fleet a great way to the west∣ward; but at length it became more favourable, and bore them in directly to the shore. About eight o'clock the headmost ships discovered the ene∣my bearing to the northward, between the island of Belleisle and the main land of France.</P>
<P>Hawke saw at last what he had so long, and so ardently wished for, (though hitherto in vain) the enemy in his reach. But yet there were such difficulties in his way, as would have checked a very cautious com∣mander, or perhaps any commander in circumstances less critical to the publick safety. On the slightest in∣spection of the chart it will appear, that all this sea is sown thick with sands and shoals, and shallows and rocks; our pilots were by no means well acquainted with it; and the wind blew little less than 2 violent storm, and the waves ran mountain high. In these circumstances they were to attack a very strong squa∣dron of the enemy on their own coast, with which they were perfect∣ly acquainted. All these difficulties only animated the English Admiral. In one of the finest ships in the world, commanding the flower of the British navy, and seconded by some of the most tried and bravest officers in the service; and above all not dubious of himself. He order∣ed the ships nearest the enemy im∣mediately to chase, and, by engag∣ing them, to give time for the rest of the fleet to come up.</P>
<P>M. Conflans had two choices, ei∣ther to fly, or to stand and fight it out. But he followed neither per∣fectly; for some time he appeared as if he meant to fight; but after giving the British ships time to come near him, when it was too late, he crouded all the sail he could carry; at the same time he shewed an atten∣tion to keep all his squadron toge∣ther.</P>
<P>At half an hour after two, the ac∣tion began with great fury. In two hours the enemy had lost three ships of the line, one struck, two were sunk outright. Hawke ordered his ship to reserve her fire, to pass by all the others, and to be laid along side of the Soleil Royal, the best ship in the French navy, and commanded by M. de Conflans; the master re∣monstrated on the almost inevitable danger of the coast. Hawke an∣swered, <Q>“You have done your duty in this remonstrance; now obey my orders, and lay me along side the French Admiral.”</Q> A French ship of 70 guns generously put him∣self between them; Hawke was obliged to bestow here the fire he had reserved for a greater occasion, and at one broadside sunk her to the bottom. The headmost of the English ships fired on the enemy as they came up to them, and then past on to others, leaving those behind to improve their success, and destroy or take them; and by this method they had got up quite to the van of the enemy, and would have totally destroyed their fleet, had not night interposed to save them. Before night came on, the enemy's fleet was much dispersed; but in the eagerness of the pursuit, two of the English ships unfortunately run up∣on a sand, called the Four, and were lost. The enemy fled in to their own coast. Seven ships of the line threw overboard all their guns, and escaped into the River Villaine;
<PB N="129" REF="145"/>
about as many more got out to sea, and made for other ports.</P>
<P>Nothing could be conceived more dreadful than the night which suc∣ceeded this action. A violent storm blew all night long. It was a pitchy darkness; a dangerous coast sur∣rounded them on almost all sides. A continual firing of distress guns was heard, without knowing whether they came from friend or enemy; and on account of the badness of the coast and the darkness of the night, our people were equally unable to venture to their assistance.</P>
<P>When morning came on, they found the French Admiral had run his ship, and another called the Heros, on shore; the first was set on fire by the enemy, the other by our seamen. Thus concluded this remarkable action, in which the French had four capital ships de∣stroyed, one taken, and the whole of their formidable navy, in which consisted the last hope of their ma∣rine, shattered, disarmed, and dis∣persed. The long threatened inva∣sion which was to repair their losses in every part of the world, was dis∣sipated, and the credit of their arms broken along with their forces. The behaviour of the English cap∣tains and seamen, on the contrary, added as much to the glory of the British arms, as to the safety of their country. Perhaps there never was a naval engagement of such extent, in which no captain was accused, nor even in any degree suspected of misbehaviour or cowardice; in which those who engaged, and those who did not, gave proofs that they were equally ardent in the service of their country.</P>
<P>Those who think such matters deserving of their notice, have ob∣served, that this decisive naval en∣gagement, the surrender of the Prus∣sian troops at Maxen, and the taking of Munster, happened on the same day, the 20th of November.</P>
<P>This was the conclusion of the French affairs in Europe. The is∣sue of the campaign in America had not been more favourable to them. Although the events in the East In∣dies belong properly to the last year, yet, as the accounts did not arrive until this, and that the actions there were of great importance, and equal∣ly fortunate on our side, it is proper that we should take some notice of them here.</P>
<P>The English had by no means that superiority over the French in the East Indies, which they had in America. It was here the French seemed to have made those efforts, by which they hoped in some degree to ballance their losses in other parts. They had a very strong squadron un∣der Mons. d'Ache in those seas. M. de Lally, an officer of credit, and of greater rank than had usually been sent on that service, commanded a body of 2000 Europeans, a great ar∣my, in a country where the name of an European is itself a strength. In the beginning, their success seemed proportioned to their forces; they took the fort and city of St. David's. But in a very short time the ill star of France, which in no part of the world sets well on their affairs, be∣gan to influence them here. M. d'Ache, in two naval engagements, was worsted, and prevented from co∣operating with the land forces for the rest of the campaign. And had the spirit and conduct of Admiral Pococke been as well seconded by some of his captains, as it was by others, there is great reason to be∣lieve, that the French naval power had been as effectually destroy∣ed
<PB N="130" REF="146"/>
in those seas, as it has been in those of Europe.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these checks, it was necessary that M. Lally should act. But it was not only the dis∣grace of the French fleet, but an ex∣treme want of money which delay∣ed his operations. A Prince of the country, the King of Tanjour, ap∣peared the only resource which was open. To this Prince he applied for a considerable sum of money, which being resolutely refused, he carried the war into his dominions, and laid siege to his capital city. But after lying several days before it, and after having even made a practicable breach, the skill of some English gunners, the want of provi∣sions and ammunition, and the dis∣orders which reigned in his army, obliged him to return without the money, and with the mortification of being beaten from a place, only for∣tified after the Indian manner.</P>
<P>This failure in their pecuniary expectations, and their repulse from an Indian town, were bad encourage∣ments to the undertaking of an en∣terprize against an European ene∣my, and a fortification in some de∣gree regular. But having seized upon a Dutch vessel, as it is thought much with its own consent, which contained a large treasure, they set out at length to besiege Madrass. But here their success was no better than at Tanjour, tho' their strength was greater, and their efforts much more obstinate.</P>
<P>Colonel draper and Major Brere∣ton defended the place with the utmost skill and bravery. Mr. Pi∣got likewise with equal generosity and prudence, seconded their endea∣vours, by the supplies of stores and ammunition, which were admirably distributed, and co-operated with the military with a firmness and in∣trepidity, by which he obtained an honour equal to any in the defence of the place. Whilst the town was defended with great spirit within; parties were continually sent out, which so infested the roads through which the enemy's convoys were to pass, that their army in the trenches was infinitely weakened by the de∣tachments which they were obliged to send out. After a siege of more than two months, they were obliged to abandon their enterprize, and by that means renounce for ever all those sanguine hopes, which they had entertained from the forces in this part of the world. The Eng∣lish, on the contrary, went on from success to success. Whilst they de∣feated the French on the Eastern coast of the great peninsula of India, on the western they took the great and opulent city of Surat from the powers of the country, with very little loss.</P>
<P>General Lally left Madrass in the utmost transports of rage and despair, which a man of honour and ability in his profession can feel, who is ill seconded by his troops, neglected by those who ought to support him, and cheated by the villainy of con∣tracters, and of all those who turn war into a low traffick. His letter is a strong and very striking picture of these agitations; and certainly it is worthy of remark, that every where there should appear something more unaccountably wrong and weak in the management of the French, than has been in the conduct of that or almost any other nation at any time. It seems to argue an essential and radical fault in some superior part of their government, more easily in∣deed visible in its consequences, than discoverable in its cause.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="147"/>
In Europe they rececived offers of peace from the Kings of Great Britain and Prussia. But as they did not expect, from their situation, very advantageous or honourable terms, they resolved to act, in one instance, the Roman part, and still hold out, determined to hazard the last extremities; perhaps, hoping something favourable from the for∣tune of their allies, since their own had deserted them; and resolving to contract their plan, and to make one strong effort in one part, rather than unprofitably to waste their strength upon several inferior ob∣jects. This effort could be made with any prospect of success only in Germany. But the supplies ne∣cessary for this great charge, were difficult to a nation, whose trade was wholly destroyed. On this oc∣casion they did not scruple to break in upon the public faith, and to find supplies for one year in an expedient, that struck at the sources of all future credit. They stopped the payment on many public bills and funds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French court have stopt payment of the following public debts, viz. 1. The three kinds of rents created on the posts. 2. Those constituted upon the chest of redemptions. 3. The coupons of bills on the same chest. 4. Those of the two royal lotteries. 5. The reimbursement of bills drawn to bearer on the same chest. 6. The bills of the two royal lotteries. 7. The rents created on the two sols per pounds of the tenth penny. 8. The reimbursement of the capitals of rents. 9. The payments of bills dischargeable in nine years, known under the name of annuities. 10. Those of the new actions on the benefit of the farms. 11. All the bills drawn by the colonies upon the government, amounting to 1.333,000l.</NOTE>. The King threw in his own plate into the public stock as an example, and a request that others should contribute in the same manner from their private fortune, to the necessities of the state; tho' several of the nobility, and many churches and convents sent in their plate, there was yet a general back∣wardness to give into this method of supply, and to trust the public with so considerable part of their sub∣stance at the instant when they saw it so notoriously break its faith in other particulars.</P>
<P>However, these resources, such as they are, will enable them to keep the war on foot. They turn their whole attention to Germany, where they have very greatly augmented their army, and placed it under a general, from whom they have some hopes, after their repeated disappoint∣ments, and the frequent changes they have made. They propose al∣so another army under the Prince de Soubise; if they can compass this latter project, as it is believed they may, the system of Germany is still in very imminent danger. For not∣withstanding the tried goodness of our troops, and the admirable com∣mander at the head of them, it is certain, even with any reinforce∣ments we may be able to send, we shall find it very difficult to con∣tend with two armies, supposing that we shall have no other than French armies to contend with, and that the King of Prussia should be able, as he has hitherto been, to find employ∣ment for the many, the powerful, and the implacable enemies that sur∣round him.</P>
<P>It is certain he is much reduced; and that his resources are nearly ex∣hausted.
<PB N="132" REF="148"/>
These are facts which cannot be concealed; and yet some glimmering of hopes may be still preserved, when we consider the admirable talents for war and go∣vernment, which that monarch pos∣sesses; and when we consider even the events of the last (to him) un∣fortunate campaign; where after having suffered four capital defeats, and having obtained no one consider∣able advantage, he has yet continued in some sort superior in the field; the enemy has not been able to make the least impression upon his dominions; and he has, at last, more than divided Saxony with them; the city of Dresden is all that they possess in that country, and the acquisition of which has been the only fruit of four campaigns, and four victories in one campaign, and the efforts of the united forces of Austria, Russia, and the Empire, to say nothing of France and Sweden.</P>
<P>As for Great Britain, she has only to fear from her connections. In no one year since she was a nation, has she been favoured with so many successes, both by sea and land, and in every quarter of the globe; nor have her officers, both by sea and land, ever done more honour to their country, by their skill and bravery. And with regard to the in∣ternal administration, it suffices to say, that whilst France became bank∣rupt, without delay or murmuring there has been more than six millions borrowed in England at a very easy rate; and that the interest on this immense sum has been made good by a single tax upon malt, which will scarce be felt by the people. By this the resources of England may be imagined; especially if we consider, that highly as we are taxed for the necessary charges of the war; we have not been prevented from great and expensive voluntary exertions of public spirit and bene∣ficence. The cities of London and Westminster, and after their ex∣ample other towns, made a large subscription for enlisting soldiers. Sub∣scriptions were also carried on to a great amount, for cloathing the ene∣mies prisoners, abandoned through the neglect or poverty of their sove∣reign; and for administering to the relief of the families of those who had fallen in the battles of Quebec and Minden. Thus actuated by the warmest patriotism, which far from extinguishing, seemed to kindle a beneficence towards our enemies in their distress.</P>
<P>The condition of Europe, which all people thought would have been decided in this campaign, is nearly as dubious as ever; and the difficulties which oppose them∣selves to a peace are rather aug∣mented than diminished. Here then we close the scene, and conclude the events of the present year; in the next we hope, notwithstanding appearances, after so many scenes of horror, to have the more pleasing task of relating the steps taken to a general peace, on terms as par∣ticularly advantageous to our own country, as the mixed interests of Europe, and the various fortunes of the powers embarked in the same cause, will admit.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT WAR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>For the YEAR 1760.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Nothing decided in the war. State of the several powers concerned. Great Britain and Prussia propose an accommodation. Difficulties in concluding a peace. The condition and hopes of France. Demands on the King of Prussia. Treaty said to be between Russia and Austria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF all the wars which have ha∣rassed Europe for more than a century had not proved it, the events of the last campaigns must have satisfied every thinking man, that victories do not decide the fate of nations. Four most bloody, and to all appearance most ruinous de∣feats, which he suffered in that year, had despoiled the king of Prussia of no more than a single town. After these accumulated blows he still found himself in a condition to make good his winter∣quarters; to cover his dominions; and to tempt the favour of fortune in another campaign.</P>
<P>To carry our attention a little further back; who could have ima∣gined, that when the French had compelled the Hanoverian troops to lay down their arms, when they had thrust them into a defenceless corner, had bound them down with the yoke of a strict and severe capi∣tulation, and had possessed them∣selves of every place which could boast the smallest share of strength in the king's German dominions, that in a few months they should find
<PB N="134" REF="150"/>
themselves compelled to fly before their captives; and after having suf∣fered a considerable defeat, should be pushed back almost on their own territories.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it might have been supposed that the effects of these advantages under the management of a very great commander, who was besides largely reinforced, could have been frustrated only by the loss of some great battle. But the fact was otherwise. The Hano∣verians, without any adverse stroke in that campaign, were obliged to repass the Rhine and the Lippe; and since that time, fortune having decided nothing by the events of five years war, has given to Prince Ferdinand the possession of a great part of Westphalia in the manner of a conquered country; and yet sees him abandoning Hesse, and with dif∣ficulty covering the borders of Ha∣nover.</P>
<P>In short, the victory of Crevelt could not enable the Duke of Bruns∣wick to defend the Rhine. The battle of Bergen did not give M. Broglio an entrance into Hanover. The great victory of Minden did not drive the French from the Maine. We have seen armies, after complete victory, obliged to act as if they had been defeated; and after a defeat, taking an offensive part with success, and reaping all the fruits of victory.</P>
<P>These reflections are still more strongly enforced by the fortune of the King of Prussia. Covered with the laurels of Lowositz, Prague, Rosbach and Lissa, when he began after so many compleat triumphs, to pursue his advantages, and to improve success into conquest, the scene was suddenly altered. As soon as he attempted to penetrate with effect into the enemies coun∣try, without having suffered any very signal blow, without any con∣siderable mistake committed upon his side, Fortune, who hath as it were attached herself to the defen∣sive, immediately forsook him. He was not able to take a single place. And those advantages which at other times and situations, would have laid the foundation of lasting empire, have in his case only pro∣tracted a severe destiny, which some think in the end inevitable; but which as many, as great, and as en∣tire victories since obtained over his forces, have not been yet able to bring upon him.</P>
<P>The ballance of power, the pride of modern policy, and originally invented to preserve the general peace as well as freedom of Eu∣rope, has openly preserved its liberty. It has been the original of innume∣rable and fruitless wars. That Po∣litical torture by which powers are to be enlarged or abridged, accord∣ing to a standard, perhaps not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y accurately imagined, ever has been, and it is to be feared will always continue a cause of infinite conten∣tion and bloodshed. The foreign ambassadors constantly residing in all courts, the negotiations inces∣santly carrying on, spread both con∣federacies and quarrels so wide, that whenever hostilities commence, the theatre of war is always of a prodigi∣ous extent. All parties in those dif∣fusive operations, have of necessity their strong and weak sides. What they gain in one part is lost in ano∣ther; and in conclusion, their af∣fairs become so ballanced, that all the powers concerned are certain to lose a great deal; the most fortu∣nate acquire little; and what they do acquire is never in any rea∣sonable proportion to charge and loss.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="151"/>
Frequent experience of this might prove one of the strongest grounds for a lasting peace in Eu∣rope. But that spirit of intrigue, which is the political distemper of the time, that anxious foresight which forms the character of all the present courts, prevent the salutary effects which might result from this experience. These mo∣dern treaties of peace, the fruits not of moderation but necessity; those engagements contracted when all the parties are wearied and none satisfied, where none can properly be called conquerors or conquered, where after having sought in vain to compel, they are content to over∣reach, teem in the very moment they are formed, and from the very act of forming them, with the seeds of new dissentions, more implacable animosities, and more cruel wars. For if to forward the work of peace, any member in these alliances should acquire a cession of any importance in its favour, this afterwards be∣comes a ground for another alli∣ance, and for new intrigues to deprive them of their acquisition. To settle the peace of Germany, Silesia was yielded in 1745 to the King of Prussia, and that cession gave occasion for the war of 1756.</P>
<P>The kings of Great Britain and Prussia chose the moment of suc∣cess, to propose an accommodation; and they desired that the opposite powers should concur with them in nominating some place for a con∣gress. Some spoke of Leipsic, as a means of indemnification to that un∣fortunate city; the States General would have given a town of theirs; King Stanissaus offered Nancy, his capital: but the time of peace was not yet come. The two kings made a display of moderation; and they had reason to think that if their proposals should be accepted (which probably they did not then expect) they must naturally take the lead in that negotiation, and must give the whole a turn to their ad∣vantage. But the adverse alliance unanimously rejected their offers, and the refusal of some of its mem∣bers was couched in terms sufficient∣ly haughty.</P>
<P>To speak impartially, they could not at that time have accepted pro∣positions for peace. France had suffered in every quarter: in her present condition she could scarcely look for very favourable terms. As they had now abandoned in despair all attempts by sea, and consequent∣ly all efforts in North America and both the Indies, all their hopes were centered in Germany. Hither∣to their fortune in that country had not been very encouraging. But still, in that country lay their best and indeed their only prospect. The strength and perseverance of the two empresses, the wasted condition of the K of Prussia, the enormous expence the German war to England, which must gradually exhaust the resources of her credit, and with them the patience of an inconstant people, had inspired with no small hope. All these considerations confirmed their resolution of hearkening to no terms, until by acquiring superiori∣ty, or at least an equality, they might be assured of procuring such as were not very disadvantageous or humiliating.</P>
<P>The empress queen upon her part had a moral certainty, that she could not procure, by a treaty proposed at such a juncture, those objects for which she had begun, and with such steadiness in every fortune had car∣ried on the war. In reality, her circumstances then were and they still continue very intricate and em∣barrassed.
<PB N="136" REF="152"/>
It was necessary that she should have allies of great power; but if they have done her great services, they have formed high pretensions; indeed so high, that if she and her allies cannot abso∣lutely prescribe the terms of peace, it is impossible that they should all be in any degree satisfied.</P>
<P>Her situation in this respect has pushed <HI>ad internecionem,</HI> the war between her and the King of Prussia. Even the cession of all Silesia in her favour, cannot procure a peace for that monarch. The Russians will never let loose their hold of the ducal Prussia; a country conquered by their own arms, a possession which rendered the king most formidable to them, and which is their sole in∣demnification for what they have expended in a war entered into for other views than those of glory, or even of revenge. It has been confidently asserted, that the em∣press queen of Hungary has actu∣ally guarantied the possession of that country to its conquerors. This is indeed a very extraordinary step, and the fact is not sufficiently authenti∣cated. But the report is not alto∣gether improbable. We may be sure that if such a guarantee has been made, it has been entered in∣to upon some reciprocal engagement of equal force, and for an object equally important.</P>
<P>Nothing but the last desperate necessity, nothing in short but being conquered in the most absolute sense, will ever induce the King of Prussia to submit to both these ces∣sions. By such a submission, beside being despoiled of that conquest, which is the great glory of his reign, and constitutes the firmest support of his revenue, he will see his hereditary dominions curtailed of another province from whence he derives his royal title, and what makes it of infinitely greater im∣portance in his eyes, the best com∣mercial part of his territories, and that only part of his territories, by which he could have hoped to be∣come in any degree a maritime power.</P>
<P>But tho' it were possible that his Prussian Majesty could be brought to submit to these humiliating terms, a great deal still remains to be ad∣justed. There are other demands, which though not so high in their nature, nor so strongly enforced, are notwithstanding considerable, and cannot with any decency be totally neglected. What is the na∣ture of the bargain between the Empress and the Senate of Sweden, has not yet been made publick. Be it what it will, this is probably the least perplexing part of the whole.</P>
<P>But some indemnification for the King of Poland, on whose domini∣ons the greatest calamities of the war have fallen, seems absolutely necessary; and on what principle can Austria ever expect an ally, if she should secure all the benefits of the pacification to herself, and leave to her confederates nothing but the sufferings of a war in which they were involved purely in her quarrel?</P>
<P>This variety of demands, all to be satisfied out of the dominions of a single prince, must necessarily per∣plex the work of peace with almost insurmountable difficulties. It ought not indeed to be concealed, that there are circumstances which feem to lead to some solution of this em∣barrassment. But if they are atten∣tively considered, they will, I be∣lieve, be rather found to increase it.</P>
<P>Great Britain has had remarkable success against France at sea, in America and in the Indies. On the continent of Europe, her for∣tune
<PB N="137" REF="153"/>
is even at this day, tolerably ballanced: the two weak parts, therefore, in the opposite alliances, (I speak only with regard to the events of the present war) are France and Prussia. As therefore France will expect some cessions from Great Britain, it is reasonable that they should be bought by some moderation of the rigorous terms which otherwise would have been imposed on Prussia.</P>
<P>All the sacrifices to peace must be made out of the advantage ac∣quired by Austria and Great Britain. But when Great Britain shall have consented to some concessions, to forward this great work, what re∣turn can the Empress Queen make, but an abatement of her demands upon Silesia? That is, by giving up that grand, favourite, and indeed to her sole object, for which she has brought upon her∣self an heavy war, disgusted her ancient and natural allies, and pur∣chased the aid of her natural ene∣my, at the price of places which the best blood of Europe has been so often shed to preserve in her fa∣mily. To all who consider the cha∣racter of that court, it will appear very plainly that she will hazard almost any thing, and even risque those consequences to which her imprudent alliance with France has exposed her, rather than accept a peace which must deprive her or her hopes of Silesia.</P>
<P>When these things are weighed, it will not appear wonderful that there have been so few serious over∣tures for peace; and that the longer the war continues, the greater diffi∣culties seem to oppose themselves to any conclusion of it.</P>
<P>The only hope that remains of any happy conclusion, is that some of the great members of the al∣liance, wearied and exhausted, will at length fly off, and thereby throw the rest into such confusion, that a peace will be suddenly huddled up; and all difficulties not removed, but forgotten, by not allowing time to weigh and study what may be gained or lost. This must produce a system of pacification, the nature of which it is impossible to foresee; because it cannot be said upon which side this defection will begin; but prin∣cipally because the war still con∣tinues, in the event of which, in spite of all that can be conjectured from the strength and present con∣dition of the powers concerned, for∣tune will have so large a share. But we may predict without rash∣ness, that the first overtures will be between Great Britain and France: for they never think of peace in Germany.</P>

<P>THIS was the posture of Eu∣rope at the close of the cam∣paign of 1759. And all thoughts of peace being entirely removed, the war was prosecuted in this part of the world with the utmost vigour as soon as the season permitted them to recommence operations.</P>
<P>But in America, the severity of winter was not able wholly to inter∣rupt the progress of the war. Ca∣nada had been supposed conquered,
<PB N="138" REF="154"/>
by the taking of Quebec. Indeed without the possession of that place, it had been impossible to reduce that country; but still a great deal re∣mained to compleat the advantage to which the taking of Quebec had only given an opening. The French troops after their defeat, had retired into the heart of their country. And the English navy having provided the town sufficiently with military stores and provisions, set sail, fearing lest they should be overtaken by the frost. Ten battalions, two companies of the artillery, one of American wood∣rangers, in all about 7000 men, formed the garrison which was left in Quebec to command Canada during the winter, and to facilitate the en∣tire reduction of that province in the ensuing campaign. They were un∣der the orders of Gen. Murray.</P>
<P>As the river St. Laurence is com∣monly shut up by ice, for the greater part of the winter, all communication with Europe was cut off. The con∣quering army was therefore subject to be invested in Quebec. The French commander M. Levi, was sensible of this advantage; and he saw that it was the only resource by which he could have any chance of preserving Canada. He accordingly prepared to make use of this last, and only opportunity; and he was not with∣out some prospect of success.</P>
<P>He knew that the fortifications of Quebec were weak and incomplete, without any kind of outwork; that the town was almost a general ruin, since the late siege; and that the English garrison had been much en∣feebled, and greatly reduced in their numbers by the scurvy. He knew also, that by some misfortune, no provision had been made to prevent his attaining a superiority on the ri∣ver; as no vessels had been left, on a supposition, that they could not be useful in winter.</P>
<P>The winter had passed in skir∣mishes always terminating in fa∣vour of the English, by which they enlarged the sphere of their subsistence. M. Levi had indeed proposed, during the rigour of the season, to attempt the place by a coup de main; and had made pre∣parations for that purpose. But the activity of the garrison was such; and all the outposts so well secured, that he thought it more prudent to abandon that design, and to post∣pone his operations, to the opening of the spring, when a regular siege might be formed.</P>
<P>The forces which still remained in Canada, were not unequal to the attempt. Ten battalions of re∣gular troops, amounting to near five thousand men; 6000 of the experienced militia of Canada; a∣bout 300 savages. This was the force which M. Levi had collected at Montreal, and with which he took the field on the 17th of April, 1760.</P>
<P>His provisions, ammunition, and heavy baggage, fell down the river St. Laurence, under the convoy of six frigates from 44 to 26 guns. By this squadron, which there was no∣thing to oppose, he acquired the undisputed command of the river, a point of the greatest importance to the whole design. In ten days march, the French army arrived at the heights of Abraham three miles from Quebec.</P>
<P>When Gen. Murray perceived the approach of the enemy, he had two parties to take, either to keep within the town, and confiding in his troops, which though weak as an army, were strong as a garrison, to sustain the siege to the utmost extremity; or to march out, and by trying the fortune of the field, to avoid the tedious hardships of a
<PB N="139" REF="155"/>
siege, in a place which seemed to him scarcely tenable.</P>
<P>He resolved on the latter party. But when he came to review his ability for this undertaking, he could possibly draw into the field no more than three thousand men. However he was not frighted by the enemies great superiority. He determined to engage; and he grounded his resolution on the fol∣lowing reasons.</P>
<P>First, that his army, notwith∣standing its inferiority, was in the habit of beating the enemy. That they had a fine train of field artil∣lery; that to shut themselves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the single chance of hold∣ing out for a considerable time a wretched fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter, at the same time that it gave an additional one, and per∣haps a better; and in fine, that if the event was not prosperous, he might, after holding out to the last extremity, retreat, with what should remain of the garrison, to the isle of Orleans or Coudres, and there wait for reinforcements.</P>
<P>It is not easy to comprehend the prudence of engaging in the open field, an army four times superior; especially when the weaker army had it in their power to keep upon the defensive in a strong post; and Quebec may well be considered at least as a strong retrenchment. It is as hard to understand how the chance of holding out a fortress, should not be lessened after a defeat of the troops, which compose the garrison, who must necessarily suffer by such an event, both in numbers and in spirit; it is equally difficult to con∣ceive how the remains of that gar∣rison, which should be driven from Quebec, could have safely retreated to the isle of Orelans or Coudres, or have remained in either of these places, with any tolerable security, whilst the enemy were, as they were, confessedly masters of the river. These are matters not so easily com∣prehended by those who are at a dis∣tance from the scene of action; there circumstances may have given these reasons their due weight; and they had the greater influence from the character of the general; a man of the most ardent and intrepid courage, passionately desirous of glory, and emulous of the reputa∣tion Wolfe had acquired. He knew that a bold and successful stroke, and well pursued, might so dis∣able the enemy who were in no likelihood of receiving speedy or considerable succours from France, that the way to conquest would lie plain and open before him; and he might expect the honour of the to∣tal reduction of Canada, before the arrival of the rest of the king's forces to his assistance.</P>
<P>Thus depending on fortune, on the tried goodness of his troops, and his own courage to animate them, he marched out of the city, and descended from the heights of Abra∣ham with the army mentioned above, and twenty field pieces. The right and left of the enemy's van pos∣sessed themselves of some small woody eminences: the main army marched by the road of St. Foix; and formed themselves under the shelter of the woods. Whilst the body of the enemies army was yet unformed, the English troops attacked their van, both on the right and left, with the utmost impetuosity, and drove them from the eminences, though they were well maintained; the advan∣ced posts of the French center gave way, without a blow, and fell back upon their main army.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="156"/>
Hitherto the fortune of the field was favourable to the English; but now the advantages they had ob∣tained brought them full on the main army of the French, which formed in columns, and advanced with great rapidity to support their broken vanguard The fire became very hot, and stopped the progress of our troops; whilst those of the enemy having supported their center, wheeled round the flanks of the British army to the left and right, and formed a semi circle, which threatened to close upon our rear. Proper movements were made to protect the flanks, but it was evi∣dent the army was in the greatest danger, not only of a defeat, but of seeing itself surrounded, and its retreat to Quebec intirely inter∣cepted. Near one thousand men, soldiers and officers, (a third of the army), had been by this time killed and wounded. Nothing could be now thought of but as speedy a re∣treat as possible; and in this there were difficulties, which nothing but the bravery of the soldiery and the skill and spirit of the officers could overcome. They gained Quebec with little loss in the pursuit; but they were obliged to leave their cannon, which they could not bring off, on account of the wreaths of snow, which even in this advanced season, and in the temperate lati∣tude of 47, still lay upon the ground. The French lost at least 2000 in the action.</P>
<P>When the account of this victory arrived in Europe, the French were for a while infinitely elated. The blow was sensibly felt in England. Our sanguine hopes were at once sunk. If Quebec was lost, it was evident that the greatest difficulties must have arisen to our affairs in America; and the reduction of Canada must become the work of more than one campaign. Nobody imagined that the town could hold out long after such a defeat; and the fleet sent from Europe to reinforce the place was then at a great distance.</P>
<P>Nevertheless all things were pre∣pared at Quebec for a vigorous de∣fence. The late check he had re∣ceived, only roused the governor to more strenuous efforts. He knew that the loss of the place would be attributed to the temerity of his councils; he was sensible that in proportion to the honours paid by the public to those who had con∣quered Quebec, would their indig∣nation fall upon those by whom it should happen to be lost; and that in general nothing makes a worse figure, than a rashness which is not fortunate. These thoughts were perpetual stings to a mind like his, passionately desirous of glory; and that very disposition which led him to fight unsuccessfully with a weak army, gave him activity and success in the defence of a weak fortifica∣tion.</P>
<P>The French, whose whole hope of success depended on perfecting their work before a British squadron could arrive, lost not a moment's time to improve their victory. They opened trenches before the town the very night of the battle. But it was the 11th of May before they could bring two batteries to play upon the fortifications. They were greatly deficient in this respect. Their accounts say, they had no more than twelve pieces of iron artillery, which carried twelve pound balls. The English train, was without comparison, superior. Be∣fore the French had opened their batteries, 132 pieces of cannon were placed on the ramparts. The fire of the besiegers was therefore
<PB N="141" REF="157"/>
always slack, interrupted, and of little effect.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the weakness of the enemies fire, the superiority of the English artillery, and the resolu∣tion of the governor and garrison, the relief of the place depended en∣tirely on the early arrival of the British fleet, which was looked out for every hour with the most anxious expectation. Had any French ships of force come before the English, it was the general opinion that the place must inevitably have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>On the 9th of May, to the great joy of the garrison, an English fri∣gate anchored in the bason and brought them an account that the British squadron commanded by Lord Colville, was then in the river. On the 15th, a ship of the line and a frigate arrived; the next morning the two frigates were sent to attack the French squadron above the town. They executed their commission so well, that in a moment all the French vessels of whatever kind were dis∣persed, and the greatest part destroy∣ed or taken.</P>
<P>M. Levi, who had the mortifi∣cation to behold from the eminences this action, which at one stroke put an end to all the hopes he had conceived from his late victory, was persuaded that these frigates by the boldness of their manner, must have been the vanguard of a considerable reinforcement; and that too close at hand: he therefore raised the siege in the utmost hurry and precipitation, leaving behind all his artillery, and a great part of his ammunition and baggage, although Lord Colville, with the rest of the squadron, did not arrive at Quebec until two days after.</P>
<P>Thus was fortunately preserved from the most imminent danger, the most considerable place we had taken in the war; and that which gave us the most decisive advantage. The triumph of the French, and the anxiety of England, were but short. The account of the siege, and the raising of it, followed close on the heels of each other. And there was nothing now to cloud the prospect of the certain reduction of Canada, by the united efforts of three English armies, who by different routs were moving to attack those parts of it which still remained to France. In the mean time that haughty power was obliged to sit the impotent spec∣tator of the ruin of her colonies, with∣out being able to send them the smal∣lest succour. It was then she found what it was to be inferior at sea.</P>
<P>We shall resume the American af∣fairs, when we have reviewed the scenes that began about this time to open on the theatre of Europe.</P>

<P>A Winter remarkably severe suc∣ceeded the bloody campaign of 1758. At Bareith in the night of the 16th of December, the cold was insupportable. Reaumur's ther∣mometer was sunk to 15, which is
<PB N="142" REF="158"/>
precisely the same degree it fell to in 1709. A year like this distin∣guished by the intenseness of the cold, and the fury of war. Birds dropped dead in their flight. At Leipsic ten centinels were frozen to death. An infectious disease which began in the armies, diffused itself among the inhabitants of Saxony, and made a dreadful havock. A pestilential contagion raged among the cattle. Famine was soon added to the rest of their calamities; and every misery that can afflict man∣kind, was poured out upon that unfortunate people with the most liberal measure. There was no pros∣pect of an alleviation of these dis∣tresses. On the contrary, the suf∣ferings of the people only made their sovereigns more earnest for revenge; and out of the general want a re∣source arose to their armies, who were the more readily recruited, because the scanty pay and sub∣sistence of a soldier, became an ob∣ject of envy to the wretched peasan∣try in most of these countries; and death seemed more honourable and less certain by the sword, than by penury and disease.</P>
<P>France and England vied in their endeavours to augment their forces in Germany. M. Broglio had now the command of the grand army, and the sole conduct of the general plan of operations. He had early in this year, been honoured with the staff of a marshal of France. And nothing was omitted to give lustre to his command, and to furnish him with every means of exerting his talents. His corps was augment∣ed to near 100,000 effective men. Thirty thousand drawn out of their quarters in Dusseldorp, Cleves, Co∣logn and Wesel, and compleated by draughts from France, formed a separate army on the Rhine, under the Count de St. Germain. This disposition was made not only to divide the attention of the allied ar∣my; but to prevent the ill conse∣quences of the misunderstanding which was known to subsist between this general and the Duke de Broglio. The third army proposed at the close of the foregoing campaign did not appear.</P>
<P>On the side of England, the pre∣parations were not less considerable in proportion to her ability for that kind of war. Six regiments of foot commanded by Major Ge∣neral Grissin, were forthwith sent to reinforce the allied army. El∣liot's regiment of light horse soon followed them. At the opening of this campaign, we had in Ger∣many twelve regiments of heavy, and one of light horse; and twelve regiments, with two Highland bat∣talions of foot; the whole amount∣ing to about 22000 men. In the course of the summer, they were further reinforced to near 25000. Such a number of British troops, serving in one army, had not been seen on the continent, for two hundred years past. The al∣lied army indeed fell short of the French in numbers; but they ex∣ceeded it in the quality of the troops. Those newly arrived from England were fresh but not undis∣ciplined; the old were indeed har∣rassed, but they had been accustom∣ed to victory.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year, the death of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel had ex∣cited <NOTE PLACE="marg">31 J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> some apprehensions; the dis∣positions of the successor were un∣certain; and his withdrawing him∣self from the cause of the allies would have made a breach in their
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
army, that it would have proved al∣most impossible to stop. But these fears were soon dissipated. The new Landgrave among the very first acts of his government, gave the strong∣est proofs of his steady adherence to the system of his father, and even agreed to add considerably to the Hessian troops in the pay of Great Britain; so that all things promised as favourably to the allies, as from that irremediable inferiority in num∣ber could have been expected.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia was under far greater difficulties; he had felt the heaviest blows, and was most scanted in the means of healing them.</P>
<P>His losses were not to be reckoned by the men killed and prisoners, but by armies destroyed or taken. Forty generals had died, or were slain in his service, since the first of October 1756 exclusive of those who had been wounded, disabled or made prisoners. And this alone would have been a loss not to be repaired, if these murdering wars which cut off so many experienced officers, did not at the same time, form so many more to supply their places. The king had renewed his alliance on the former terms with Great Britain. By his indefatigable industry, no gaps were seen in his armies. But they were no longer the same troops, and if the King of Prussia had formerly the merit of ably commanding the most excellent armies; he was now to fill up the most remarkable deficiency on the part of his troops by his own he∣roism; and to undertake far more arduous enterprizes, than his first, with insinitely weaker instruments. His affairs wore a bad aspect in the opening of the former year. In this they seemed altogether desperate.</P>
<P>The Russians had suffered; but they were sufficiently reinforced. The Swedes who had been generally obliged to give ground in the winter, had in that of 1759 the advantage in several smart skirmishes, and had even taken prisoner the Prussian general Manteuffel. As to the Au∣strians, victorious for a whole cam∣paign almost without fighting, their armies and magazines were full, their corps compleat, their men fresh, vigorous, and full of resolu∣tion. Several skirmishes of conse∣quence had been fought during the cessation of the great operations; and they were generally to their ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia was sensible, that in this, as in the former cam∣paigns, he should be attacked by four armies; and that his dominions would be invested upon every side. As these operations were very ex∣tensive and complicated, to enable the reader to form an idea of the campaign, it will not be amiss to say something of the ground the king had to defend, which is circum∣stanced in this manner.</P>
<P>To the north is Pomerania. This country is very open; and it is de∣fended on that part on which the Swedes generally act, with but few and those mean fortifications, An∣clam, Demmein and Passewalk. But then the Swedish army is not nume∣rous, and if they should attempt to penetrate far into the country, they must leave Stetin, in which there is always a strong garrison behind them to their left, which would render their subsistence difficult and their retreat in case of any mis∣fortune, extremely hazardous; and they have not sufficient strength to master this place by a regular siege. This has always proved a check to
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
the progress of that army, even when they have been otherwise suc∣cessful.</P>
<P>This same country to the eastward of the Oder, is one great object of the Russian designs. Its chief strength in this quarter is the town of Colberg; a place they have frequently attempted, but always without success. And their failure, in this instance, has been the main cause why they have never been able to take winter quarters in the King of Prussia's dominions, or even during the campaign, to make any considerable impression upon Pomerania. For they can have no communication with their own country by sea, for want of this port. On their rear, lies the exten∣sive and inhospitable desert of Wal∣dow; and this with the uncertain disposition of the city of Dantzick, renders their supplies of provision from Poland difficult and precarious. Neither is it possible in these circum∣stances, to unite their forces with those of Sweden acting in the same country. The Oder flows be∣tween them; which is so command∣ed by the city of Stetin, as to make all communication between these armies in a great measure impracti∣cable. Insomuch that on the side of Pomerania, the force of these two powers is compelled to act separate∣ly, without concert, and therefore weakly and ineffectually.</P>
<P>To the westward the King of Prussia is sufficiently covered by the city of Magdebourg, the strongest place in his dominions, and in that part of Germany. Here are his greatest magazines, and his princi∣pal founderies; and this is the re∣pository of whatever he finds neces∣sary to place out of the reach of sud∣den insult.</P>
<P>To the southward he is obliged to defend Saxony and Silesia. Both of these countries on their frontiers towards Bohemia, rise into very rough, broken, and mountainous grounds, abounding in advanta∣geous posts and strong situations. Lusatia lies between them; a level sandy plain, (interspersed with pine∣woods,) extending without any ob∣stacle to the very gates of Berlin. Through this country the king's communication between Silesia and Saxony must be kept up, and there∣fore it has been from the beginning of this war, the great scene of those remarkable marches and counter∣marches, by which his Prussian ma∣jesty has acquired so great a repu∣tation; and also of those bold and sudden attempts which have distin∣guished some of the generals of the adverse party. As an army cannot be advantageously posted in this ter∣ritory, it has not been usual for a con∣siderable body to remain there long; and it is particularly unfavourable to defensive operations. This coun∣try may be considered as the cur∣tain, and the frontiers of Saxony and Silesia as the bastions, that flank the sort of fortification, which the king is to maintain.</P>
<P>No part of that monarch's terri∣tories are naturally more defenceless than the eastern; at the same time that it is attacked by the most pow∣erful of his enemies. A country al∣together sandy and level, extends along both sides of the Oder, from the northern frontier of Silesia, until it meets Pomerania a country of the same kind. There is no respect∣able fortification on this side; and the river Warta that falls here into the Oder, makes the transport of provisions, and consequently the subsistence of the armies that act against him more easy.</P>
<P>As to Silesia, it is covered on the
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
Bohemian side with mountains, and it contains places of such strength as to be above the necessity of yield∣ing to the first army that appears before them. Indeed it is to be re∣marked that such a degree of strength seems sufficient for the kind of ser∣vice which has distinguished this war. Never was a war of such a length and extent, in which fewer sieges of consequence have been formed; and the late service which affords so large a field for experience in every other species of military operations, affords very little matter of improvement in the art of reducing or defending strong places.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia's design seems to have been to save himself as much as possible to the end of the campaign; the only time when his success might be decisive, and his ill-fortune not ruinous. He therefore formed a defensive plan. In pur∣suance of this he withdrew his out∣posts from Freyberg, and drawing a chain of cantonments from the fo∣rest of Tharandt on his right to the Elbe, he took a most advantageous camp between that river and the Multa; strongly entrenching it where it had not been previously fortified by nature; and furnished it with so numerous an artillery, that they rec∣koned in their front only 250 pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>In this situation he covered the most material parts of Saxony, kept the attention of M. Daun's army en∣gaged, and was enabled to send out reinforcements to Prince Henry, or elsewhere, as occasion should require, without exposing one part whilst he defended another.</P>
<P>Whilst the king's army defended his conquests in Misnia, Prince Henry had assembled an army about Frank∣fort on the Oder, and took various positions about that place and Cros∣sen. In this position, he command∣ed three principal communications, in such a manner as to protect at once Silesia, the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and the avenues to Berlin; all which were threatened by several bodies of the enemy. General Fouquet had established his quarters near the county of Glatz, and whilst he covered that side of Silesia communicated with Prince Henry, and was so disposed as to send to or receive succours from him, as either party should happen to be pressed.</P>
<P>M. Daun, as soon as he saw that the King of Prussia had fortified himself in his post, he too buried himself in entrenchments, and kept the most attentive eye upon all his majesty's motions. Whilst he con∣fined himself in this position, in or∣der to tie down the King of Prussia, general Laudohn, with a strong but light and disincumbered army, moved from the camp he had occupied du∣ring the winter in Bohemia, and pre∣senting himself alternately on the side of Lusatia, and on the frontiers of Silesia, threatened sometimes to pe∣netrate to Berlin, sometimes by a bold stroke to effect a junction with the Russians, and attack Prince Henry, sometimes to sit down before Glatz, Schweidnitz, or Breslau; and thus the alarm was spread upon every side, not knowing where the storm would fall.</P>
<P>At length he declared himself. Having by several feints persuaded General Fouquet that his inten∣tions were against Schweidnitz, that general marched thither a con∣siderable body of his troops, and left Glatz uncovered. As soon as Laudohn perceived this movement, he on his side made another, and
<PB N="146" REF="162"/>
possessed himself of Landshut; and when he had taken Landshut, he pretended a design of securing this post by leaving a small body of troops there. This feint also suc∣ceeded, and drew General Fouquet from Schweidnitz back again to Landshut. He drove the Austrians from that place without difficulty; but in the mean time Laudohn made himself master of several important passes, by which he was in some sort enabled to surround the corps of Ge∣neral Fouquet.</P>
<P>That commander finding himself in those dangerous circumstances, had nothing left but to fortify his post, formerly made a very strong one, with additional works; which he did with such effect, that it had more the resemblance of a regular Fortification than an entrenchment. However, the army he commanded was far from numerous; and he was obliged to weaken it still farther by a detachment of 2000 men, to pre∣serve, if possible, a communication with Schweidnitz.</P>
<P>Laudohn longed to distinguish himself by some capital stroke; and he had now by a series of very artful movements procured a most favourable opportunity. First, therefore, he shut up with great dexterity the passes on every side, and rendered his adversary's retreat impracticable. Then he began an <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 23.</NOTE> attack on the Prussian en∣trenchments in the dead of the night in three different places. The signal for the assault was given by four hawbitzers fired in the air. The Austrians rushed to the attack with uncommon fury, and maintained it with so steady a resolution, that in three quarters of an hour the two strongest entrench∣ments were carried, and the line of communication forced. The Prussians at day-break found them∣selves pushed back from hill to hill, and line to line, to their last en∣trenchments. Their resistance was all along brave, and their retreat re∣gular. The enemy purchased every advantage at the dearest rate; but at last pressed upon every side, worn down by a terrible slaughter, their general disabled by two mortal wounds, at eight in the morning the remnant of the army threw down their arms, and surrendered on the field of battle.</P>
<P>On the side of the vanquished, the slain were about 4000. The prisoners were, one general of foot, namely General Fouquet; two ma∣jor generals; four colonels; two hundred and thirteen officers of the inferior ranks; and upwards of 7000 private soldiers, fifty-eight pieces of artillery, with a number of colours. Never was a more entire and deci∣sive victory. The whole army, ge∣neral, officers, every thing was de∣stroyed. Scarce three hundred of the body intrenched by Landshut escaped. The corps alone which was to preserve the communication, together with some bodies of cavalry who had not been engaged, with difficulty got into Schweidnitz, where they expected every moment to be besieged. This advantage cost the Austrians above 12000 men killed and wounded.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The Austrians take Glatz. Situation of the Prussian armies. King of Prussia marches towards Silesia and deceives M. Daun. King of Prussia returns to Saxony. Siege of Dresden. Town burned. Return of Daun. Siege raised. Breslau besieged by the Austrians. March of Prince Henry. Laudohn retreats.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS victory was pursued with as much rapidity as it was obtained with courage and address. Baron Loudohn immediately turned back from Landshut, and fell like a storm upon Glatz. Glatz consists of two fortresses, the old and the new. The old was taken by storm; the new surrendered at discretion. Two thousand brave men and some good works could not defend it against the impetuosity of the Aus∣trians. One hundred and one pieces of brass cannon were taken. Im∣mense magazines of provision and military stores piled up in this fron∣tier place to favour in better times an irruption into Bohemia, fell into the hands of the conqueror. Every thing gave way. The possession of Glatz laid all Silesia open, and the Austrians might turn their arms upon any side without the least danger to the freedom of their re∣treat. Neither was there any sort of army to give the least obstruction. The King of Prussia held down by M. Daun, was in Saxony. Prince Henry was also at a great distance towards Custrin. If that Prince at∣tempted to move to the relief of Si∣lesia, he laid open Brandenburgh, and even Berlin itself to the irrup∣tions of the Russians. If he re∣mained in his post, Silesia was in∣evitably lost. Even his speediest march seemed by no means a cer∣tain way to relieve it. The king was yet further distant; and any motion of his threatened to shake and unhinge the whole scheme of his defence; exposing at once Saxony and Berlin. The loss of his third army, small as that army was, laid him under difficulties that seemed insuperable.</P>
<P>Favoured by these circumstances, Laudohn had only to chuse what direction he should give his arms. Silesia, as has been observed, lay open before him. He had threatened Schweidnitz; but he saw that Bres∣lau was a place of greater conse∣quence, much more easily reduced, and that the possession of it facilitat∣ed a junction with the Russians; a point on which the ultimate im∣provement of his victory wholly de∣pended. The place besides is of so great extent, and the works of so little comparative strength, that he had no small hopes of mastering it before Prince Henry could come, if he should at all attempt to come to its relief.</P>
<P>He therefore delayed no longer than the march of his heavy artille∣ry and the necessary preparatives required, to lay siege to the capi∣tal of Silesia, of whose safety the most sanguine friends of his Prus∣sian majesty began to despair.</P>
<P>But in the interval between the battle of Landshut and the com∣mencement of the siege of Bres∣lau, the King of Prussia was not
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
idle. His thoughts were continu∣ally employed to repair this disas∣ter; all ordinary resources were impracticable or ineffectual. His genius alone could enter the lists with his ill fortune. Placing there∣fore his hopes in himself, he aimed by a daring and unexpected stroke, to draw even from so severe a mis∣fortune some new and more bril∣liant advantages.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the plan he had laid, he disposed all <NOTE PLACE="marg">2d July.</NOTE> things for a march towards Sile∣sia, and had passed the Elbe and penetrated through a woody coun∣try without opposition; had the enemy been apprised of his march as early as he began it, it had been attended with great and un∣surmountable difficulties. Marshal Daun no sooner had advice of his march, than he also immediately moved with the utmost expedition at the head of his main army to∣wards Silesia, leaving the army of the Empire, and a body under Ge∣neral Lacy, to awe Saxony in his absence.</P>
<P>The two armies continued their out through Lusatia; that of the King of Prussia a little to the northward, that of Marshal Daun to the southward; both apparently pushing towards the same object, and with equal eagerness. But as the army of the marshal had rather the shorter cut to make, and as he moved with far greater and more unaffected diligence, he got very considerably the start of the king. When his majesty was ap∣prised that Marshal Daun had <NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE> gained full two days march upon him; that he had actually arrived at Gotlitz, and was pushing by forced marches to Lauban; his great pur∣pose was obtained. Immediately he struck into Marshal Daun's track, but wheeled into the opposite direction, repassed the Spree near Bautzen, and whilst every one imagined him on the frontiers of Silesia, he suddenly sprung up like a mine before Dres∣den. The army of the Empire re∣tired. Lacy's corps was obliged to shift its situation. The Prussian generals Hulsen and Ziethen, who had probably been prepared to act in concert with the king, joined him before that place, and knowing there was <NOTE PLACE="marg">13th July.</NOTE> no room for delay, began the siege with the utmost vigour.</P>
<P>Then was this most unfortunate city a third time exposed to the fury of war. The inhabitants suf∣fered in their habitations for the weakness of the works; and there were armies both without and with∣in of such mutual and determined rage, and so careless of all things but their enmity, that they little scrupled to strike at each other through the bodies of the suffering Saxons. All Europe had now its eyes turned to the event of this masterly manoeuvre; and certainly through the whole course of this eventful war, nothing appeared more worthy of regard, nor at any time had there been exhibited a piece of generalship more compleat, than the conduct of the King of Prussia's march.</P>
<P>Since Dresden had fallen into the hands of the Austrians, it had been strengthened with the addi∣tion of several new works. The burning of the suburb by the Prus∣sians, in order to keep them out, became an advantage to them when they came to possess the town. In short, the place was ren∣dered in all respects more defensi∣ble than formerly. It had also a
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
very large garrison under General Macguire, an officer of courage and experience, who resolved to main∣tain it to the last extremity: when he was summoned to surrender, he made answer, "That it was im∣possible the king could have been apprised with his being entrusted with the command of that capital; otherwise so great a captain as his majesty would not make such a proposal to an officer of his stand∣ing: that he would defend himself to the last man; and wait whatever the king should think proper to at∣tempt."</P>
<P>Both parties being therefore in∣spired with the utmost resolution, the one to attack, the other to de∣fend, the siege was pushed on by every method of force and address; there was scarce any intermission of assaults, surprizes, coup de mains, sallies, and all kinds of actions used on such occasions; and all the most vigorous in their way. In the mean time three batteries of cannon and mortars played continually, but with much greater damage to the buildings than effect on the forti∣fications.</P>
<P>Marshal Daun was in Silesia when he heard all at once of the deceit put upon him by the King of Prussia, of his return to Saxony, of the siege, and the extreme dan∣ger of Dresden. His return was as rapid as his march had been. On the 19th he appeared within a league of Dresden. His approach only caused the Prussians to re∣double their efforts; that day they had received reinforcements of hea∣vy cannon and mortars, and bat∣tered the place with new fury. The cathedral church, the new square, several principal streets, some pa∣laces, the noble manufactory of porcelain, were all entirely reduced to ashes.</P>
<P>The siege continued till the 22d. The night of the 21 st M. Daun had thrown sixteen battalions into Dres∣den. It was in vain to continue any longer the pretence of besieging a whole army within the town, whilst at the same time there was another army to reinforce it without. The king withdrew his forces without molestation from the suburbs, tho' there were three considerable armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood, besides that which was within the walls.</P>
<P>Thus ended, without the suc∣cess so masterly a proceeding de∣served, the King of Prussia's fa∣mous stratagem. But the want of success can detract nothing from the merit of the measure. By drawing Marshal Daun from Saxony to Silesia, he gained the use of eight days, free of obstruction from the enemy's grand army; eight days at a time when hours and even moments were critical. In this time he had certainly a chance at least of reduc∣ing Dresden; and by the possession of that place he would have found himself infinitely better able to car∣ry his arms to the defence of every part of his territories for the present, and for the future would have that great place of retreat in case of any misfortune. If he failed in this at∣tempt his affairs were precisely in their former condition; and he could not suffer in reputation by having made it.</P>
<P>As the King of Prussia could not be blamed for the speedy return of Marshal Daun, and the conse∣quences of that return; so neither in effect could the marshal suffer any just imputation in having been deceived by the king's march. He
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
knew that there were very plau∣sible motives to call, and even to press him to move that way. He knew that if the king should get into Silesia without any opposition from him, Laudohn might not only be deprived of all the advantages he could hope for from his late victory, but by being attacked by the united armies of the king and his brother, would run the risque of a defeat that might fully revenge that of Landshut.</P>
<P>Whatever the merit of either of the commanders might be on this occasion, it is certain that Laudohn met no considerable obstruction.</P>
<P>He appeared before Breslaw the 30th of July; the following day the town was compleatly invested; and on the first of August they had erected their batteries of cannon and mortars.</P>
<P>But Laudohn, who saw all things prepared for an obstinate defence, did not wholly trust to his military manoeuvres. He sent a letter to the governor Count Tavenzien, to in∣timidate him by the display of his strength. He set forth, that his forces consisted of 50 battalions and 80 squadrons; that the Rus∣sian army of 75,000 men were within three days march; that it was in vain for the governor to ex∣pect succour from the King of Prus∣sia, who was then at the other side of the Elbe; that it was still more vain to look for relief from Prince Henry, who could scarce hope to stand his own ground against the grand army of the Russians; that in case of obstinacy he could expect no reasonable terms; and that these were the last that should be offered. Moreover he reminded him, that the place was a mercantile town, not a fortress; and that he could not defend it without contravening the laws of war.</P>
<P>These rules, by which honour is reduced to act, not by its own feelings, but according to intrinsical circum∣stances; rules by which they have attempted to determine exactly and mechanically that nicest of all lines which discriminates courage from rashness, form one of the strongest in∣stances of the great difference between the ancient and modern methods and ideas of war. In the ancient times, a brave commander would have an∣swered this threatning message in ge∣neral terms of defiance. But Count Tavenzien respected these imaginary laws. He took care to prove that in defending the town, he did not in∣fringe them; and spoke as Laudohn had done in the character of a mili∣tary jurisconsult, as well as a soldier; he gave for reply, "That the town of Breslaw being surrounded with works and wet ditches, was to be considered as a place of strength, and not simply as a mercantile town. That the Austrians themselves de∣fended it as such in 1757, after the battle of Lissa. That the king had commanded him to defend it to the last extremity, that therefore Gene∣ral Laudohn might see it was not from humour he had refused to listen to his summons. That he was not frighted with the general's threats to destroy the town; for he was not entrusted with the care of the houses, but the fortications."</P>
<P>Laudohn had also sent in a memo∣rial in the same menacing stile, where he thought it might have a greater effect, to the civil magistrates, hop∣ing that the ruin with which the town was threatened, might induce them to join with the inhabitants, to persuade the governor to a speedy surrender.</P>
<P>All these menacing measures seemed to argue a fear in Baron Laudohn, that the Russians were not
<PB N="151" REF="167"/>
so near as he pretended, and that the town might possibly be relieved before their arrival. However he shewed them, at nine of the very evening of the message, that his threats were not vain, by a terrible discharge of mortars and red hot balls that fell in an uninterrupted shower upon the city until mid∣night. During this fierce bombard∣ment, that made a dreadful havock in the town, he attempted the out∣works by assault. His Croats at∣tacked the covered way in many places at once, with the usual im∣petuosity of those brave irregulars; but they were received and repulsed with resolution equal to their own, and with more steadiness.</P>
<P>The operation of this dreadful night, having made no impression on the inflexible determination of the governor, Baron Laudohn had once more recourse to negotiation. He now changed his stile, and held out the most flattering propositions; offering to grant him what capitula∣tion he should think proper to ask, and even to leave himself to draw up the articles. The governor replied that the firing the town had made no change in his resolution; that he would wait with firmness for the enemy upon the ramparts; but that he could not help observing, it was contrary to the laws of arms to be∣gin the siege of a fortress, by ruin∣ing its inhabitants. The messenger made answer, that the trenches would be soon opened. The go∣vernor said, it was what he had long expected.</P>
<P>The Austrians, foiled in their hopes from treaty, continued to bat∣ter the town, and made several at∣tempts upon the outworks for three days successively. They found every post bravely defended; the Russian army did not appear, but they now began to perceive the approach of another army less agreeable; that of Prince Henry; which having marched with the utmost diligence from Great Glogau, now came fast upon him; and on the 5th of Au∣gust, reached within a few miles of the town.</P>
<P>Laudohn did not think it expedient to put the advantage he had gained, and those which he had yet to ex∣pect from the management of time, to the issue of a battle; he therefore decamped and made his retreat in good order, but with sufficient quick∣ness; having procured from this en∣terprise only the wretched satis∣faction of reducing a great part of the city to a heap of rubbish, and of having revenged upon Breslaw some part of the sufferings of Dresden.</P>

But the vigour of their operations did not altogether corresponded with what might have been expected from their strength and mutual ani∣mosity. The campaign, at least in any effective manner, opened late. A country which had been so long
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
the theatre of so ruinous a war, had been too much wasted to make the subsistence, and consequently the free motion of the armies easy. The winter had been severe and long; and it was not until the green forage appeared plentifully above ground, that those great bodies of cavalry, which make so large a part in our modern armies, were in a condition to act. The sufferings of the English horse, from a want of dry forage, during a great part of the winter and the spring had been extreme; this obliged them to fall much further back from the French cantonments; and to molest them less than they otherwise would have done. It was besides a loss, that at the opening of the campaign, they had not so extensive a tract between them and Hanover; which by an artful choice of posts might have been yielded step by step, and the campaign so managed and spun out, that the season of action must-have expired, before the French could have reaped any decisive advantage from their superiority.</P>
<P>Although the French were during the winter supplied far better than the allies with all necessaries by the command of the Maine, the Moselle and the Rhine; and that the countries at their back had been much less consumed by the war; yet the same difficulties embarrassed them as soon as they thought of taking the field, and quitting their advantageous cantonments. There∣fore there was a slowness in the prin∣cipal armies upon both parts, until the middle of summer.</P>
<P>Not however, but that some∣thing was attempted in this interval, by lesser parties. On the side of the Rhine, some actions happened between the army of St. Germain, and the corps of General Sporken, who was posted at Dulmen, to ob∣serve the French in that quarter. Dulmen formed the right flank of the chain of cantonments made by the allied army, which extended its left to the south-east frontiers of the country of Hesse, above an hundred and fifty miles distant. The Here∣ditary Prince who was on that wing, exerted, as much as circumstances would permit, his usual activity and enterprize. He threw himself into the district of Fulda; he laid it un∣der an heavy contribution, and broke up several French corps that were posted there.</P>
<P>These actions decided nothing. The French army superior in num∣ber, and in situation, advanced; and the allies, who seemed to have chosen the defensive, gradually re∣tired. In effect, if the French had pursued their original plan, it would have proved almost impossible for the allied army to maintain its ground. If St. Germain, pos∣sessed of Cleves, Wesel, and Dus∣seldorp, had advanced on the side of Munster; and M. Broglio mov∣ing forward through the country of Hesse, had made a strong de∣tachment to the eastward of the Weser, whilst with his main body he engaged the attention of Prince Ferdinand, the allies would shortly have found themselves enclosed up∣on three sides; and nothing could have extricated them but a capital victory obtained under every disad∣vantage.</P>
<P>The French army was sufficient∣ly numerous for these operations. But it was suspected that the jealou∣sy which subsisted between M. de St. Germain and the Duke of Brog∣lio prevented their being carried in∣to execution. This misunderstand∣ing
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
daily increased. Insomuch, that M. Broglio thought fit to order the corps of St. Germain to unite itself with the grand army. The count, who could not brook obe∣dience to a younger officer, and one besides with whom he was not on the best terms, retired from the service. He had only served before upon con∣dition <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23</NOTE> of commanding an army en∣tirely distinct, and under his own particular orders. This difference deprived France of one of its most able generals, and disconcerted one of its most promised schemes of operation.</P>
<P>Before this misunderstanding had produced these effects, the affairs of the French went on with all imagi∣nable prosperity. The principal army not retarding itself, by con∣sideration of the places of strength which the allies possessed in their front, the castles of Marburg and Dillenbourg, pushed forward into the landgraviate of Hesse, leaving detachments to reduce those for∣tresses. The first of which surren∣dered on the 30th of June, the latter held out to the 16th of July; but the garrisons of both surrendered prisoners of war.</P>
<P>In the mean time whilst M. Broglio advanced on <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 10.</NOTE> the side of Hesse; the corps of St. Germain had penetrated through the dutchy of Westphalia, and the two armies joined near a place cal∣led Corbach. The allied army had fallen back from the post they occu∣pied at Fritzlar, and were retreat∣ing towards the river Dymel. As yet they had received no advice of the dreaded junction of the French armies; but as it was ima∣gined that the corps of St. Ger∣main only moved that way, and the vanguard only of that corps could be arrived at Corbach, which could not be estimated at more than 10,000 foot, and 17 squadrons at the utmost, the Hereditary Prince formed a scheme of attacking and driving them from that post.</P>
<P>When he had begun the attack, contrary to his expectation he found the enemy already formed; but it was now impossible to recede. The action grew every moment more furious and bloody. The French stood their ground with firmness, and the main army being extremely near, instead of being wasted in the action, they grew more numerous by the reinforcements that were con∣tinually sent.</P>
<P>In this situation it was necessary that the prince should make as speedy a retreat as possible; but the difficulty of drawing out of the field in the middle of the day, before an enemy quite fresh, and every in∣stant reinforced, may be easily ima∣gined. To compleat this difficul∣ty, some bodies of the German troops both horse and foot fell into great confusion. The enemy saw it at the first glance, and to in∣crease it to the utmost disorder, pushed forward upon them with a numerous artillery and a large body of cavalry. The allied army seem∣ed to be in the way of inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>In this exigence the Heredi∣tary Prince, as his last resource, put himself at the head of a squadron of Bland's and Howard's regiments of dragoons. By these the uncom∣mon heroism of their young lead∣er was perfectly seconded. They charged the enemy with the utmost fury, stopped the career of their victorious horse; and enabled the allied battalions to make an undisturb∣ed retreat.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince was wound∣ed
<PB N="154" REF="170"/>
in this action; about 900 men were killed, wounded, or prisoners, fifteen pieces of cannon, the whole of the artillery, was left to the ene∣my, but still in their circumstances to have avoided a total defeat, was in some sort victory. The well∣timed impetuosity of the Hereditary Prince, and the spirit of the English horse, could not be too highly praised. The prince retired to the main army of the allies, who had now possessed themselves of the strong post of Saxenhausen: whilst the French continued opposite to them in the no less strong post of Corbach, which they had acquired by their victory; and here for some time they watched each other.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince suffered more by this check than from the wounds he had received. His mind, forgetful of his pain and weakness, only brooding over his defeat, seek∣ing out with anxiety an opportuni∣ty of revenging his loss by some bold, signal, and unexpected stroke against the enemy. It was not long before an opportunity presented itself.</P>
<P>Advice had been received, that among the detachments which the French employed to reduce those fortresses which the allies had gar∣risoned on their retreat, there was one very considerable, formed of French and Saxons, under Mons. Glaubitz, moving towards Ziegen∣hagen, a place of importance in the landgraviate of Hesse. The Here∣ditary Prince undertook to relieve it, and for <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 July.</NOTE> that purpose selected six batta∣lious of the German troops, two brigades of hunters, a regi∣ment of hussars, and Elliot's light dragoons. Although this last corps was but just arrived, had been newly raised, and had never seen any kind of service, the prince was so well pleased with their coun∣tenance, that he chose them pre∣ferably to all others for this difficult enterprize and the event proved that he was not mistaken.</P>
<P>Mons. Glaubitz remained in the most perfect security; he was under no sort of apprehension of being molested by a detachment of an army at sixty miles distance, under the eye, and as it were guard of a superior body which demanded all its attention; when on a sudden he found himself attacked with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16.</NOTE> utmost violence. The Hereditary Prince having reconnoitred his po∣sition, made a detour of two leagues through woods and mountains, fell upon his left, whilst the rest of his troops climbed the mountains on the opposite side, and rushed with the same spirit upon the right.</P>
<P>Glaubitz had scarce time to form his troops; and they were only formed to be immediately broken. They retired with precipitation, leaving their camp and all it con∣tained to the enemy. The prince had so disposed his cavalry as to cut off the retreat of some; but the most considerable part gained ground upon him. On this occa∣sion he relied entirely on Elliot's horse, as it was altogether impos∣sible for the infantry, already haras∣sed by the action, and a most fa∣tiguing forced march of two days, to follow them. At the head of this horse he overtook the fugitives as they came out of a wood, charg∣ed and broke through them five different times, separated a body of 500 from the rest, surrounded them and obliged them to throw down their arms. Having routed this, with the like rapidity, he flew to
<PB N="155" REF="171"/>
another body who had taken post near a wood, surrounded them in the same manner; summoned and re∣ceived them all prisoners of war. A regiment of the enemy's hussars was entirely cut to pieces. Nothing was wanting to compleat his victory. Elliot's light horse, proud to be led on by the prince himself, and worthy of that honour, had the greatest share of the glory and suf∣ferings of that day. So young a corps had never so eminently di∣stinguished itself. No more than 79 of the allies were killed in this action, but of these 71 were of this single regiment.</P>
<P>The numbers of the enemy kil∣led is not known, but for a time the slaughter was terrible. General Glaubitz himself was made prisoner, together with the Prince of Anhalt. There were besides 177 officers, and 2482 private men. A greater num∣ber of prisoners could scarcely be expected from a victory in a general engagement. The trophies were nine pair of colours, and six pieces of cannon. In all the <HI>Petite Guerre</HI> of this campaign, (and the campaign between the French and the allies was almost wholly made up of such,) this was by far the most brilliant action; and alone might have established the reputation of the Hereditary Prince, if any thing had been wanting to establish him the first man of his age, in that spe∣cies of war. He returned to the camp of Saxenhausen, without mo∣lestation, having fully revenged the affair at Corbach.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand did not remain long after this action in his camp at Saxenhausen. By so advanced a position, the landgraviate, and even Hanover, lay too open to the enemies incursions. He therefore took his camp at a place called Kal∣le, in a situation nearer to Cassel. On this M. Broglio formed a plan, which the greatness of his army in some sort enabled him to execute. The Chevalier de Muy, who com∣manded in the room of the Count St. Germain, was ordered to cross the Dymel at Statbergen, with his reserve, consisting of 35,000 men, in order to cut off the al∣lies from their communication with Westphalia. Whilst the rest of the French, dividing themselves into two bodies, moved, the main army under M. Broglio towards Duke Ferdinand's camp at Kalle, the re∣serve under Prince Xavier of Saxony towards Cassel.</P>
<P>These important movements o∣bliged Prince Ferdinand to set him∣self also in motion; and as he was not in a condition to make detach∣ments of sufficient strength, he cros∣sed the Dymel with his grand army, in order to fight the chevalier de Muy.</P>
<P>His serene highness formed his main body on the heights of Corbach, and moved <NOTE PLACE="marg">31 July.</NOTE> towards the enemy, who were ad∣vantageously posted near War∣bourg; in the mean time the Hereditary Prince with two co∣lumns wheeled round the enemies left, and began a vigorous attack at once upon that flank, and upon their rear. The French command∣er poured reinforcements on that quarter. An hot engagement was there maintained with equal obsti∣nacy for near four hours. Whilst this combat continued with uncer∣tain fortune on the left, Prince Fer∣dinand caused some bodies to file off towards the French bridges on the Dymel to their right, by which he proposed to attack also on that side, and intercept them on their re∣treat;
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
at the same time the main of his army advanced with the utmost expedition to charge the enemy in front.</P>
<P>The French now saw themselves in the most imminent danger of being surrounded. Already their left, attacked in flank and rear by the Hereditary Prince, began to give way: his fire became every moment superior; and the earliest retreat was the safest.</P>
<P>As soon as Prince Ferdinand per∣ceived the enemy to retire, he saw it was absolutely in vain to think of bringing his infantry upon their front. The English cavalry also, upon which he chiefly confided, was too distant to give almost any hope that they could be made to act. But the English cavalry out-did his ex∣pectations, and indeed all former examples. They considered them∣selves as defrauded of their share of the glory of Minden: and they panted for an occasion of signalizing their courage; and their command∣ers, Lord Granby and Mostyn, for∣warded their ardour, knowing that great actions are commonly transgres∣sions of ordinary rules.</P>
<P>They came up five miles on a full trot, (the Germans called it a gallop) without being blown, with∣out the least confusion or disorder, and attacked the enemies cavalry and infantry several times. The great∣est part of the enemies horse fell back and did not stand the charge. The English artillery were brought up with the same surprizing quick∣ness, and employed with the same powerful effect. Captain Phillips had done more with artillery than had been thought possible at Min∣den; and he exceeded it at War∣bourg. The English foot vied with the cavalty and artillery, and made such earnest efforts to come to action, that in straining their passage thro' morassy ground and in burning weather, several soldiers dropped down on their march. But they were too late to engage, and proba∣bly in their wasted condition it was well that it so happened.</P>
<P>The French made a precipitate retreat towards Statberg; several were drowned in passing the Dymel; 1500 were left on the field of battle; as many were made pri∣soners. Ten pieces of cannon were taken; but they consoled them∣selves in having lost no colours. The loss of the allied army in gene∣ral has not been, that I can find, published. That of the English in killed, wounded, and missing, was 590, but then the battle lay chiefly on them, and the killed in∣cluded in that number were but about 130.</P>
<P>So brilliant a success following close on the heels of the former, raised the reputation of the allied arms. As considerable an advan∣tage might have well been expected from it; but according to the usual play of fortune in this war, the first account that followed the de∣feat of so large a part of the French army, was, that with a rapid and unresisted tide of success, they had reduced Cassel, Eimbach, and Zie∣genhayn; by which they became masters of the whole landgraviate of Hesse; that they had pushed into the king's territories, seized upon Gottingen and Munden, and threa∣tened Hanover itself. In short, al∣most the worst consequences which could have arisen from a defeat fol∣lowed a victory; and whilst in Eng∣land we gave a loose to our joy on the success of our arms, the French were taking the most important places of our allies.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173"/>
The fact was that Prince Ferdi∣nand must have been sensible, that in quitting his camp at Kalle and taking post to the northward of the Dymel, he in a great measure laid open Cassel and the whole territory of Hesse to the French; nay, that by this movement nothing was left to hinder their entering the Ha∣noverian dominions on the right of the Weser. But notwithstanding these risques, the step he took was prudent, and even necessary. Had he suffered the progress of the Che∣valier de Muy, on the Dymel; had he permitted him to strengthen his posts upon that river, his communi∣cation with Westphalia had been ine∣vitably cut off, and of course his sphere of subsistence greatly streigh∣tened. It would have had a worse effect. For he must have entirely lost the command of the Weser, without which he could not have stood his ground a moment; and he would on that loss have found him∣self compelled to retire into the heart of Hanover, where he must necessari∣ly be streightened in his winter canton∣ments, and where a blow of any conse∣quence must be decisive against him.</P>
<P>He therefore fought the battle of Warbourg though he lost all Hesse by his victory; and he would not quit his posts on the Dymel, though he saw Gottingen and Mun∣den in the hands of the French. He was not to be frighted from his steady and well chosen plan, by vain rumours or threatening ap∣pearances. He was by no means in a condition to make large detach∣ments; it was therefore necessary to sacrifice something; and he made the smallest sacrifice that cir∣cumstances would admit. For he foresaw that the French army whilst he kept his position on the Dymel, could not possibly take up their quarters in Hanover, or even act there in any considerable body, and for any considerable time, without subjecting themselves to the same or greater inconveniencies than those to which he would have been himself liable, had he in de∣fending Hesse suffered them to oc∣cupy those critical posts on the Dymel. He knew farther, that it would prove extremely dangerous for them to hazard themselves be∣yond Gottingen; and that it would be more difficult for the French army to support themselves in that advanced post, than for him to annoy them there.</P>
<P>It is possible that reasons some∣what like the foregoing, together with others probably far more co∣gent, might have determined that great commander to this conduct. But whilst he secured that middle communication, and acted upon the defensive plan, the troops were not idle; his detachments acted in many parts with spirit and effect. But we must defer for a while the narrative of these actions, being called from this part of the theatre to the eastern parts of Germany, where a∣bout this time scenes of greater eclat were opened.</P>

Intercepted letter from the King of Prussia to the Marquis of Argens.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the time that the King of Prussia found himself com∣pelled to raise the siege of Dresden, it was evident that he could have no hope of acting in Saxony to any good purpose. The busy part of the campaign came on fast. Though Prince Henry had obliged Laudohn to retire from Breslaw; that gene∣ral, able, and lately victorious, was still formidable; he kept Neisse and Schweidnitz blocked up; and waited to effect a junction with the Russians, by which he pro∣posed to give the final blow to the king's power in Silesia. The Russians had now actually arrived in the frontier parts of that province, and wanted but a very few days easy march to compleat that fatal and long dreaded junction. At the same time another body of Russians had penetrated into Pomerania; laid all the defenceless parts under con∣tribution; and threatened the siege of Colberg. The Swedish army, said to consist of 22,000 men, com∣menced also, tho' with less vigour, their operations. In all that country the King of Prussia had not 5000 men to oppose them.</P>
<P>In these circumstances a plan of mere defence would have proved altogether without effect. The King of Prussia had but two armies; and it was necessary that one of them, at least, should make the most rapid and sudden movements to op∣pose so many combinations. On the side of Silesia the danger seem∣ed most pressing, and accordingly he marched to its relief; advanced near two hun∣dred <NOTE PLACE="marg">30th July.</NOTE> miles, and left Marshal Daun, who had considerably the start, far behind him. This march would have been thought an astonishing exploit in a partizan at the head of a small and disencumbered corps: but that a numerous army, clogged with its artillery, with a∣bove two thousand waggons, should in that time traverse such a space, should pass the Elbe, the Spree, the Neisse, the Queiss, and the Bober, five considerable rivers; that they should effect all this, with one army of the enemy on one side of its flanks, another behind, and with a third in its front (the actual position of the Austrians in Lu∣satia) was an action reserved for, and only to be expected from the King of Prussia. The attempt itself could have been justified only by necessity; and the necessity was urgent. The Russians approached. M. Daun fol∣lowed towards Silesia; and the king could hardly promise himself success, but from a march of such ra∣pidity, as might enable him to try his fortune with General Laudohn, before the triple junction he apprehended had made his enemies irresistible.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="175"/>
But notwithstanding the hopes conceived from this march, before the king could come to an action three bodies of Austrians had joined, Laudohn's, Daun's, and Lacy's; and extending themselves along the Katsbach, a river which falls into the Oder, occupied all the ground from Parchwitz to Cossendau, a space of little less than thirty Eng∣lish miles. But in this extent, their posts were every where strong, and their communications easy. The king's camp was at Lignitz. It was in vain that for several days he at∣tempted, by various devices, to de∣tach one body of the enemy from the rest, or to turn their flanks and attack them at disadvantage. The nature of the ground or the skill of the opposite generals always disap∣pointed him.</P>
<P>At length M. Daun took himself the offensive party. The advan∣tage of his situation, and the su∣periority of his numbers, prevailed over his cautious nature to risque an attack. It was therefore resolved, after the situation of Lignitz had been well reconnoitred, all circum∣stances maturely weighed, and the design communicated to the other generals, to attempt the King of Prussia in his camp, with the united strength of the three armies. To ensure success beyond a doubt, it was determined that this attempt should be made by surprize, and therefore in the night. M. Daun remembered the bad guard which had been kept by the Prussians; and the advantage, which in the year 1758 he derived from a night attack at the battle of Hohkirchen.</P>
<P>In consequence of this plan the whole army, as soon as it should begin to grow dark, was to march from their several posts to such situ∣ations as were marked out for each corps; they were to strike their tents, but yet to keep up the fires in their camps, and to have the drums beat the tattoo as usual.</P>
<P>Some time after Marshal Daun had begun to move, to his astonish∣ment the patroles he had sent out returned with the account, that they had met no out-posts. As soon as day broke and the army had ad∣vanced, their apprehensions were confirmed. They were disappoint∣ed in their design, there was no enemy in the camp; but when they cast their eyes from thence, they could perceive at a distance the rising of a thick smoke, which left them no room to doubt that their fortune was then on the point of decision, by a part of their forces only, and that the king and Baron Laudohn were on that moment hotly engaged; Daun could only look on and wait the event.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July the king was in his camp at Lignitz, when he received advice that the Russian army of 24,000 men, under Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges o∣ver the Oder, at a place called Au∣ras, and that they were to pass the river on that very day. He suspect∣ed also, that the enemy had formed the design of a general attack. Troops which have been a long time op∣posed to each other can reciprocally guess at each other's designs; the method used by the enemies ge∣nerals grows familiar, and the least motion they make discloses their designs.</P>
<P>This is the account the Prussians gave of the means by which they came to a knowledge of M. Daun's projects. The Austrians attributed this discovery, not to the Prussian sa∣gacity, but to intelligence given by deserters.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176"/>
Whatever the means were by which the King of Prussia became suspicious of this design, it is cer∣tain, that he took the most early, the most vigorous, and the most effective measures to defeat it. He thoroughly sensible of the danger he ran of being surrounded, if he continued in his post at Lig∣nitz; out of that very design, which was calculated for his ruin, his genius drew a new means of safety. He saw at a glance, that the plan which the enemy had formed to surround him, at the same time, necessarily divided their own armies. And this division was the great object he had pursued so long, and thro' such discouraging disappointments. His only business was to prevent their reuniting in a general attack upon his quarters. Therefore in the very evening calcu∣lated for the attempt on his camp, he quitted it with as much privacy as the enemy had proposed to attack it, marched and took an advantageous post on the way through which Lau∣dohn was to pass.</P>
<P>And now the decisive hour ap∣proached, in which he was to put to the risque as great a stake as had been play'd for since the begin∣ning of the war. No vulgar ad∣vantage would suffice in his situa∣tion, and that very situation in some sort disabled him from attain∣ing a great one. After four bloody campaigns, and the vicissitudes of a success in all its changes exhausting, his old corps was nearly annihilated. Those who succeeded to their places, had scarcely seen the brilliant times of the king's fortune; and they in∣herited neither the severe discipline, nor the undaunted spirit of the first companions of his hopes; they were new to service, yet dispirited with defeats. The king himself gave life to the whole, he alone was to rectify a thousand faults, and to sup∣ply a thousand deficiencies.</P>
<P>The post which he chose, was such, as whilst it stopped the progress of Laudohn in front, if Daun should attempt his rear, would from the nature of the ground lay him under great difficulties. This rear he fur∣ther strengthened with several bat∣teries. As soon as his army was drawn up, he divided it, leaving his right on the ground, where it had been formed to observe Marshal Daun and to maintain that post; whilst with his left he turned in order to fall upon the corps under Laudohn. No dispositions could have been made with a more perfect skill.</P>
<P>Meantime Laudohn was advancing fast to the snare which had been laid for him. Already he had passed the Katsbach, and was moving towards Lignitz, full of the hopes of no small share in the glory of giving the final blow to the King of Prussia, and had advanced as far as the vil∣lage of Psaffendorf, when by three in the morning, the day-light began to dawn; a thick fog that had covered all the adjoining grounds suddenly cleared up, and like the opening of a great scene disclosed at once the whole Prussian army, regularly em∣battled, advantageously posted, fur∣nished with a dreadful and well∣placed artillery.</P>
<P>He was now come full upon his enemy. It <NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Aug.</NOTE> was impossible to recede; the sur∣prize he intended was turned upon himself. But this able general, though surprized, was not disor∣dered. The best dispositions were made that the time would admit; a sharp and obstinate combat began; which continued without giving way on either side, until six. The King
<PB N="161" REF="177"/>
of Prussia exerted himself with in∣credible diligence to preserve an uni∣form strength in every part of his line, and hazarded his own life with a daring, which nothing but his situation could excuse from te∣merity. His cloaths were shot through in several places, his horse was killed under him. But all these troubles and dangers were fully compensated by the efforts of his troops, who maintained so steady a fire, and pushed the Austrians with so much ardour, that they at last gave ground, and retreated with precipitation, though not without some order, towards the Katsbach.</P>
<P>The king pursued them to this river, and no further. His advan∣tage as it was gained by the most vigorous steps, so bounds were set to the ardour of improving it with the most guarded caution. He feared if he pursued his success too far, it might disjoin the part of the army engaged from that which he had left to observe M. Daun; and perhaps give that general an opportunity of taking a severe revenge on the right, for the suc∣cesses of the left. Notwithstanding this reserve of the king, (a reserve, the want of which was formerly the only failing in his military charac∣ter, but which his misfortunes had now perfectly taught him,) notwith∣standing, I say he did not push his good fortune against Baron Laudohn to the utmost, the victory was com∣pleat, glorious, and adorned with all the trophies. By their own confes∣sion, the Austrians lost upwards of 6000 men, killed, wounded and pri∣soners. The Prussians made it a∣mount, and not without probability, to 10,000. Among the prisoners, were two generals, and 84 officers; 82 pieces of cannon and 23 pair of colours were taken. On the side of the conquerors, five hundred were killed, and 1200 wounded.</P>
<P>With regard to Silesia, the victory near Lignitz produced some most immediate, and most useful effects. Although M. Daun, not dispirited with his late misadventure, and only sollicitous to repair his loss, had detached a strong corps under Prince Lowenstein, and Gen. Beck to strenghthen the Russians and en∣courage them to advance, Count Czernichew was so intimidated with the late defeat of the Austrians, that he repassed the Oder by the same bridges on which he had lately crossed it.</P>
<P>Thus one great end of the King of Prussia's march was obtained. He prevented the dreaded junction of those two powers. In the other part of his design, he did not so perfectly succeed. M. Daun since the action of Psaffendorf, could in∣deed make no progress in Silesia; but on the other hand, the king was not able entirely to drive him out of that province. The Austrians even after their defeat, far superior to the king, had been besides largely reinforced. The empress exerted all her power, to remove the ill effect this late check might have had on the reputation of her arms; at the same time that she augmented her troops, she com∣forted and encouraged Baron Lau∣dohn, and by a very generous and gracious letter let him see, that she was not a sovereign, in whose mind a late misfortune cancels the memory of past services. In the praises which this letter bestowed on Laudohn, several were of opinion, was couched an indirect censure on the conduct of Count Daun, the slowness of whose temper so ill
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
agreed with the ardour of her am∣bition, and with these great hopes, which the number of her forces, and the strength of her alliance had encouraged her to entertain.</P>
<P>The king after this victory joined his brother Prince Henry at New∣marcke. One part of that prince's army under Gen. Goltze had passed the Oder to observe the Russians, who since the repassing that river, seemed to direct their motions north∣ward. The king being strengthened by this junction, and having his communication with Breslaw clear, marched against Daun, who had begun to form the blockade of Schweidnitz, fell upon a corps under Gen. Beck; made two battalions of Croats prisoners, dispersed several squadrons, and by this lively affair obliged the enemy's grand army to raise the blockade, and by a pre∣cipitate retreat, to take refuge in the mountains of Landshut.</P>
<P>Whilst his majesty was thus ex∣erting the most heroic efforts in de∣fence of Silesia; Gen. Hulsen, who commanded for him in Saxony, se∣conded his endeavours in that quar∣ter with uncommon bravery and success. The army of the empire had formed a design of cutting him off from Torgau. To frustrate their intentions, that general quitted his camp at Meissen, and marched to Strehla. The enemy divided into two bodies; one attacked an advan∣ced post about a cannon shot from his camp upon every side, with the greatest fury from day break to six <NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Aug.</NOTE> in the morning, whilst ano∣ther corps was so placed as to keep his camp in awe, and to prevent his attempting any thing for the relief of the advanced post. Gen. Hulsen saw that unless he could speedily do something for its suc∣cour, that body must inevitably pe∣rish. He therefore in this exigency, gave orders to his cavalry to make a circuit round an height; and to charge if possible the enemies flank. This order was executed with the utmost promptitude and spirit. The Imperialists were charged on their flank; their battalions and horse were thrown upon one another in confusion, and 41 officers and 1200 men were made prisoners. The loss of the Prussians was inconside∣rable. Gen. Hulsen by this ad∣vantage, was enabled to encamp under Torgau, while he retreated through an apprehension, as the grand army of the Imperialists was coming up, that he might be cut off from his communication with the Elbe. This retreat made the Austrians magnify the affair into a victory on their side; but the cir∣cumstances render the Prussian ac∣count much more probable.</P>
<P>Fortune seemed once more to have smiled, after a long interval of gloom on the King of Prussia's af∣fairs; and the reputation of his arms began to revive. But the vic∣tories he obtained, though glorious, were decisive of little more than the field upon which they were fought. They were far from ha∣ing lowered the power of the enemy to an equality with his. And the movements he made to gain those advantages, and to pro∣tect one part of his dominions ne∣cessarily exposed the rest. The enemy was able to detach without end; and whilst bodies of Russians traversed the Lower Silesia, several corps of Austrians scoured Lusatia; and thus together they broke off all regular communication between the king's army and his hereditary do∣minions, and of course between him

and his general Hulsen, who with very unequal forces was struggling to secure Saxony; a country in which there are towns indeed forti∣fied; but fortified for the greater part in such a manner, as to be little more than snares for increasing the number of prisoners, by betraying defenceless garrisons into the hands of an enemy superior in the field.</P>
<P>In this situation, the king is said to have wrote a letter to the cele∣brated <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Author of the Jewish Spy, &amp;c. and now resident at Berlin.</NOTE> Marq. d'Argens, very pathetick, and very descriptive of his condition, and of his frame of mind under those pressures. This let∣ter is said to have been intercepted by a Russian detachment, and industri∣ously spread about in order to dis∣spirit his friends. On that account some have suspected its authenticity. But the letter is surely highly con∣sonant to his circumstances, and sufficiently agreeable to his general manner of writing: so that we do not think ourselves dispensed with inserting it in this place.</P>
<P>"Formerly, my dear marquis, the affair of the 15th of August would have decided a campaign. At present that action is no more than a scratch; a great battle must deter∣mine our fate.

Don't talk to me of danger; the last action cost me only a suit of cloaths and a horse. This is buying victory very cheap.</P>

I have the labours of a Hercules to undergo, at a time of life when my strength fails me, my infirmities increase, and, to speak the truth, when hope, the only consolation of the unhappy, begins to desert me. You are not sufficiently acquainted with the circumstances of affairs to have a clear idea of all the dan∣gers which threaten the state; I know, but conceal them; I keep all my fears to myself, and only communicate to the public my hopes, or the little good news that I can acquaint them with. If the blow that I meditate succeeds, then, my dear marquis, it will be time enough to express our joy: but till then, let us not flatter ourselves, for fear some unexpected bad news should deject us too much.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="181"/>
I lead here the life of a military monk. I have much to think of about my affairs, and the rest of my time I devote to literature, which is my consolation, as it was of the consul, the father of his country and of eloquence.

<P>When our correspondence shall be more'open, you'll oblige me by writing more frequently. I know not where we shall have our winter∣quarters.

<P>Well, my dear marquis, what is become of the peace with France? Your nation, you see, is more blind, than you imagined. Those fools lose Canada, and Pon∣dicherry, to please the queen and the Czarina. Heaven grant that Prince Ferdinand may well reward them for their zeal. The officers, innocent of these evils, and the sol∣diers, will be made the victims, and the illustrious offenders will suffer nothing.</P>

<P>WE leave the King of Prussia to these thoughts, in order to return to the armies on the Weser. Pr. Ferdinand was not mistaken, in imagining that Gottingen would prove the utmost bound of the French progress into Hanover. After they had secured that place with a strong garrison, the grand army of M. Broglio moved towards the reserve which had been defeated, and pitch∣ed his camp at Dierenberg, a place
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
within a small distance of the allies, who ever since the battle continued to occupy Warbourg, the Dymel running between the two armies. In this situation they continued for a∣bout a month.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince, who was ever in motion, and continually hovering now on one side, now on the other of the French camp, in one of his excursions had perceived that the French, according to their usual negligence, were not very exact in their out-posts and pa∣trols. He had also received intel∣ligence, that they had thrown a corps of horse and foot, consisting of some∣thing more than two thousand men, into the town of Zierenberg, a place surrounded with some damaged walls.</P>
<P>From these lights, he resolved upon the surprize of this body, and accordingly made his dispositions for this bold attempt, in the man∣ner following; first, he ordered a body of his light troops to turn the town of Zierenberg, and to take post between it and Darien∣berg, in order to intercept any that should attempt passing to the camp of the enemy. Next he posted at proper distances eight squadrons of dragoons, two batta∣lions of grendadiers, and one regi∣ment of foot, on the road between his own camp and the place which was to be attacked, with a view to cover his retreat, in case he should be repulsed and pursued. With the rest of his foot, consisting for the greater part of English, he marched with the utmost caution and diligence towards the town.</P>
<P>When they had arri∣ved within two miles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Sept.</NOTE> they divided into three bodies, which took three different routs, by which the place was compleatly surrounded. At eight in the evening, they set out from Warbourg, and came before this place at two the following morning. Notwithstand∣ing the precautions taken, the trampling of the troops over the gardens gave the alarm to a guard of the enemies dragoons, who im∣mediately began to fire. Strict or∣ders had been given to proceed with as little alarm as possible, and to reserve their fire; and such was the deliberate courage, such the perfect discipline of the English grenadiers, that they sustained this fire, pushed on with bayonets, drove back the enemies piquets, killed the guard at the gate, and entered the town along with the fu∣gitives, without the least noise, hurry, or confusion. Never was surprize more compleat.</P>
<P>The column of the English gre∣nadiers having forced the gate, advanced regularly with their bay∣onets fixed, and without fiting a mus∣quet, by the two streets that led to the church-yard, (which being the only open part of the town, served the French as a place of arms,) killing or taking a great number of those who ran from the houses towards this rendezvous; and thus they ad∣vanced with the greatest order and the most profound silence, until they reached the church-yard. The night night was so dark that they formed by the side of the French, who for a while took them to be their own pic∣quets that had assembled; but they were soon undeceived; a fierce en∣counter with bayonets ensued, in which the French were quickly ob∣liged to give way.</P>
<P>Two regiments of the enemies dra∣goons
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>
endeavoured to fly to the gate that led to their camp; but they found it occupied by 400 grenadiers, who drove them back with their bay∣onets; forced from hence, they fled to another gate; there they were repulsed with a sharp fire of small arms. Then they were compelled to separate; and flying at random as fortune and the night directed, made their escape at the several breaches of the wall. The prince was master of the place in about an hour; but the nearness of the French camp and the approach of day prevented as long a continuance in the place as he wished for reaping the full fruits of his vic∣tory; therefore about three o'clock he began his retreat, carrying off 2 pieces of cannon, 36 officers, and between 4 and 500 private men. The slaughter of the enemy was considerable. The prince reached his camp without the least molesta∣tion in his retreat.</P>
<P>If we consider the difficulty of this attempt, very few have been bolder; if we examine the dis∣positions, none could be conducted with greater wisdom; if we attend to the behaviour of the troops, we shall no where find an example of more exact obedience, discipline and courage. To attack so large a body of the enemy, so strongly posted, within a little league of their grand camp, to march so far in that critical situation, and in a very dark night, to divide into so many parts, yet to act with so much order and so entire a concert, was certainly an exploit of the very first rank; and though not of any great importance in its consequences, is so admirable in its conduct and execution, that it well deserves to be told at the length we have given it. This added greatly to the reputa∣tion of the British soldiers as troops, and no less to their honour as men, by the humanity they shewed to their prisoners, and the generous sentiments of the common sort with regard to money; as there were several noble instances that night of their refusing to take any thing from their prisoners, who had offered them their purses. They lost but ten men.</P>
<P>From this time the operations of the two armies, which for a time seemed to languish, were renewed with fresh vigour. Prince Fer∣dinand perceived, that whilst the French communication with the Rhine and with Frankfort on the Maine continued open, it must prove to little purpose to attempt any thing either for the relief of Gottingen or Cassel. Their progress indeed into Hanover had been checked; but whilst ever they continued in so advanced a position, it was evi∣dently impossible to prevent their making very ruinous inroads into that country. To force them to a battle against their inclination, would be difficult, and the attempt itself dangerous. There remained but one method, which was to make fre∣quent and strong detachments into the southern parts of Hesse and Wet∣teravia, and thus render precarious the French communication with the Rhine and Maine, from whence they drew the greatest part of their sup∣plies of all kinds.</P>
<P>With this intention, he detached General Bulow at the head of a strong corps, who pushed forward toward Marpurg, surprized the town, destroyed the French ovens, with se∣veral hundred waggons of flour, and carried off a considerable quantity of cloathing and military stores. In the mean time, his light troops scour∣ed the country in such a manner
<PB N="167" REF="184"/>
as for a while answered the great end of the expedition in breaking the French comunication with Frankfort. Proceeding on this plan he made a further movement towards Fran∣kenau, which, at length, necessitat∣ed the French general Stainville, who commanded in those parts, to quit his position, and endeavour to stop the progress of this detachment. He came up with their rear as they were pas∣sing <NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Sept.</NOTE> the river Orche, and falling upon them at this disadvantage with superior numbers and great fury, he entirely routed the rear; and took some men and a very great number of horses.</P>
<P>It was to be apprehended that he might have pursued this advantage, to the entire ruin of M. Bulow's de∣tachment; if the Hereditary Prince by a forced march of five German miles had not arrived time enough to support him. On the prince's arrival M. Stainville fell back, and took possession of a strong post in which it was in vain to attack him.</P>
<P>Whilst these measures were tak∣ing with mixed success for disquiet∣ing the French, and interrupting their communication to the south∣ward of their quarters, like move∣ments were made to the northward, to oblige them, if possible, to relin∣quish their hold on Gottingen. But General Wangenheim, who with that design had crossed the Weser, and in the beginning had proceeded with no small expectations; but at length he received a severe <NOTE PLACE="marg">19. Sept.</NOTE> check, which forced him to repass the river with some pre∣cipitation. However these frequent detachments answered so well the end of harassing the French, that on the 20th they retired from Im∣menhausen, and fell back upon Cas∣sel where they began to entrench themselves. Prince Ferdinand followed them close; and the better to observe their motions, fixed his quarters as near as he could to those of the enemy.</P>
<P>But whilst the grand armies thus watched each other, the Eyes of Europe were drawn to a different quarter, by a movement equally a∣stonishing for its rapidity and myste∣rious for its design. The Heredi∣tary Prince of Brunswick, whom we have seen but a few days before in the furthest part of Hesse, suddenly appeared on the frontiers of the United Provinces, with an army of twenty battalions and ten squadrons. One detachment of his troops which had proceeded on the side of Dussel∣dorp, passes the Rhine above Roe∣root; another which had marched through Munster, passes it nearly about the same time, but a great distance below, at Rhees; these two detachments move to meet each other, and as they proceed, seize all the French posts along the Rhine; the enemy's guards are every where taken or abandon their redoubts. This puts into their pos∣session a number of boats, by which they are enabled to transport all the rest of the troops which are in∣tended to act upon the left of the Rhine. Then they proceed without delay or opposition directly to Cleves; the garrison <NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Oct.</NOTE> takes refuge in the castle, which is vigorously attacked, and in three days surrenders 500 men prisoners of war. Whilst this was performed by one body, another had laid siege to Wesel, and battered the place with so much fury, that the reduc∣tion of it appeared certain; and with it the entire possession of the Lower Rhine almost from Dusseldorp to Cleves.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="185"/>
The secrecy, and the rapidity of the march, together with the vigour of the subsequent operations, were such as might be expected from the character of the Hereditary Prince; but on what design this rapid march was made, and these vigorous steps ta∣ken at that particular time, gave room for a great deal of reasoning. During a good part of the summer, very great preparations had been made in Eng∣land for a conjunct expedition; a powerful fleet was in readiness; and they had embarked a large train of field and battering artillery, a con∣siderable body of foot, and a regi∣ment of light horse.</P>
<P>As this armament was supposed in readiness to sail about the time of the Hereditary Prince's march to the Rhine, conjecture united these two designs together, and supposed the fleet at Portsmouth and the army in Westphalia, were to act on the same plan. On this supposition it was judged that the storm would proba∣bly fall on the Austrian Netherlands; and that Ostend, which the Em∣press so unpolitically for herself, and so ungratefully to her former friends, had given into the hands of France, would be the first object of those forces which were to unite from such a distance.</P>
<P>This design of the expedition from Portsmouth has, we under∣stand, been formally disavowed. Whether in strictness, not being a principal in the war, with her im∣perial majesty, England ought to have made such an attempt, though Ostend was defended by a French garrison, we shall not take upon us to determine; but without the aid of such considerations, it is evi∣dent there were sufficient objections to it from the side of mere prudence. Almost insuperable difficulties oc∣curred in such a scheme; and it would scarcely appear to most men adviseable to add a Flemish to our German war.</P>
<P>But we think it possible to give some reasonable account of the ex∣pedition of the Hereditary Prince, independent of any connection with the British armament. For a consi∣derable time the French had seemed resolved to resume their former plan of an army on the Lower Rhine; such motions were made as strongly indicated that this design would short∣ly be put in execution; and the allied army had every thing to fear from it. For as the French were checked from proceeding to the complete conquest of the electorate by the allied army on the Dymel, if this army should itself be so check∣ed, by one of the enemy advancing from the Lower Rhine, there would be then nothing to hinder M. Broglio from sending forward so strong a re∣serve as might finally reduce Hanover. In these circumstances nothing but a very decisive victory could possibly save the allied army, thus surround∣ed and deprived of its subsistence, from perishing in the most miserable, or surrendering in the most shameful manner.</P>
<P>There was one step only which might with certainty prevent this design, and even in some measure turn it upon the enemy; the tak∣ing Cleves and Wefel into the hands of the allies. This would not only defeat the scheme of the French for acting on the Lower Rhine, but greatly embarrass their operations in every other quar∣ter. Even the attempt, though it should not be attempted with success, would necessarily draw the attention of the French that way, and thus save Hanover at least for one
<PB N="169" REF="186"/>
campaign. This alone had been a sufficient reason for the march. But had the British armament at the same time been intended for some part of the coast of France, or had England politically kept up such a rumour, when she had in reality a more remote object for her ar∣mament; in either of these cases it would undoubtedly have co-operat∣ed with the Hereditary Prince's de∣signs, by detaining a greater body of the French troops at home to defend their own coasts.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to penetrate into all the motives. But it is evi∣dent, that in the German enter∣prise every thing depended on the celerity of the operations. The siege of Wesel was carried on with great vigour, by that part of the prince's army which was on the right of the Rhine, whilst the prince covered it on the left. But before the enemy could disturb him, nature declared against his success by the fall of immense rains, which swelled the Rhine and Lippe to such a degree as greatly inter∣rupted the progress of the siege, having rendered the roads of West∣phalia impassable, and therefore prevented the arrival of these rein∣forcements which were intended to push the siege with the greater ef∣fect. These rains also made it very difficult for the prince to pre∣serve his communication with the besiegers, which however he made a shift to keep open by one bridge above and another below the town.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the French with all the expedition they could use, had collected an army under M. de Castries of thirty battalions and thirty-eight squadrons, partly from the great army in Hesse, partly from the Low Countries. This body advanced as far as Rheinberg, and after a strenuous resistance drove out a detachment of the allies which had been posted there. From thence they marched by their left, and en∣camped behind the convent of Campen. The Hereditary Prince now saw at the same time the sea∣son and a superior army acting a∣gainst him; to fight this enemy, fully prepared to receive him, with the troops which he could spare from the siege, might be a desperate at∣tempt. To break up the siege would have of itself answered the intention of the enemies march. There was no medium but a sur∣prize; which was resolved, and all the dispositions for it made with the judgment by which the great prince who commanded is distin∣guished upon such difficult occa∣sions. This attempt became the more necessary, and the less time was to be lost in making it, as intelligence had been received that the French army was shortly to be augmented by powerful reinforce∣ments. The prince began his march at ten in the evening.</P>
<P>To reach the enemies camp, it was necessary to dislodge Fischer's corps of irregulars, who had occupied the convent of Campen in their front. This produced some shot, and this shot alarmed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Oct.</NOTE> whole French army, which immedi∣ately got under arms and posted themselves in a wood. The allied troops pushed forward, twice repul∣sed the French, and with the most noble perseverance reiterated their attacks on the wood, and kept up a terrible and well supplied fire for six∣teen hours without intermission, that is from five in the morning to the same evening at nine. There have been few examples of so obstinate a combat. But at length finding night approach, the troops harassed, their
<PB N="170" REF="187"/>
ammunition spent, and all hopes vain of dislodging a superior ene∣my from an advantageous post, the Hereditary Prince having had an horse killed under him, and being himself wounded, was with regret compelled to retire. Eleven hundred and seventy of the allies were killed and wounded in this bloody action; about 500 were made pri∣soners. The loss of the French was far greater; but they had the field.</P>
<P>On this occasion, the English na∣tion regretted the loss of one of its most shining ornaments in the death of Lord Downe, who whilst his grateful sovereign was destining him to higher honours, received a mortal wound in this battle. He was a person of free and pleasure∣able life; but of an excellent un∣derstanding, amiable manners, and the most intrepid courage. In the beginning of this war he had a con∣siderable share in rousing a martial spirit amongst the young people of rank in England, and having long shewed them by a gallant example how to fight, he at last by a melan∣choly one, shewed them how to die for their country.</P>
<P>As the British troops had been the greatest sufferers in this as well as in most other actions of the campaign, great murmurs were raised against the commander of the allied army, as if upon all occasions, even the most trivial, he had wantonly exposed the lives of the British, in order to preserve those of the German soldi∣ery. Some carried this complaint to a ridiculous length. But could it with reason have been expected, that where 25,000 English had serv∣ed for a whole campaign, were en∣gaged in five sharp encounters (some of them a sort of pitched battles) in all which they acquired the whole glory, that they should lose a smaller number than 265 killed and 870 wounded, which is the whole of their loss in all the encoun∣ters of this campaign? It is true, the life of a man is a sacred thing, and of value to his country. But in some circumstances it is ridiculous for a nation to think of sparing even a greater effusion of blood to acquire reputation to their arms, and experi∣ence to the troops and the officers. The English desired the post of honour with equal spirit and wis∣dom, they were entitled to it, they had it, and they purchased it more cheaply, than on the whole might have been expected. Neither was their blood lavished on every trivial occasion, as had been falsely sug∣gested. The only affairs in which they suffered any thing worth no∣tice, were those of Warbourg and Campen; both actions of the highest consequence.</P>
<P>After the disappointment and loss the Hereditary Prince had suffered in the late engagement, he was sensible that a siege could no longer be carried on with any prospect of success, in sight of an army so much superior; the Rhine every day swelled more and more, and his communication with the troops be∣fore Wesel became ever hour more difficult. Besides, as the whole country was by this time overflowed, his men must have been exposed to the greatest hardships and the most fatal distempers. These considera∣tions determined him to repass the Rhine without delay. Notwith∣standing the extreme nearness of the French army, the late repulse the prince had met, and the great swell of the waters, such was the impres∣sion he had lest on the enemy, and the excellence of his dispo∣sitions, that they did not even at∣tempt
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>
to distress his rear; and he passed the Rhine without the least molestation, not only under the eye, but as it were within the grasp of a superior French army.</P>
<P>From this the operations of the armies became gradually more lan∣guid; for as nothing decisive hap∣pened on either side during the whole campaign, it was impossible to think at this advanced season of undertaking any very signal enter∣prise. As if by common consent they began to move towards winter quarters. So that whatever hap∣pened after this was not connected with the general plan of the cam∣paign; and were the sudden acts of detached parties who attempted some advantages of surprize. Of these we shall take some notice before we conclude, but we pass them by at present; the attention of all men being at this time more engaged by an event of the greatest importance, and which many were of opinion would make no small change in the nature of the war, and above all in the general system of pacification. This was the death of George II. king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>He died suddenly in his palace at Kensington in the 77th year of his age and 33d of his reign. The immediate cause of his death was the rupture of the substance of the right ventricle of his heart, by which the circulation was stopped in an instant. This was preceded by no sort of apparent illness. His ma∣jesty enjoyed an uncommon degree of health and strength for that age; but it was believed that he had suffered, by exposing himself too much to the cold, in reviewing some troops that were to be em∣barked for the expedition. He had been extremely sollicitous about the fortune of this expedition. He had been no less anxious for the fate of the enterprize under the Hereditary Prince, an account of the ill success of which he had received, though it was not at that time made public. This was believed to have touched him deeply, and to have been one of the causes of a death so afflicting to all his people.</P>
<P>When future historians come to speak of his late majesty, they will find both in his fortune and his virtue, abundant matter for just and unsuspected panegyric. None of his predecessors in the throne of England lived to so great an age; few of them enjoyed so long a reign. And this long course was distin∣guished by circumstances of peculiar felicity, whether we consider him in the public or the private character. His subjects, allowing for one short and as it were momentary cloud, en∣joyed perpetual peace at home, and abroad on many occasions acquired great glory. There was to the last a considerable increase in their agriculture, their commerce, and their manufactures, which were daily improving under the internal tranquillity they enjoyed, and the wise regulations that were made in every session of his parliaments. By a wonderful happiness, he left these improvements no way checked, but rather forwarded, in one of the most general and wasteful wars that has raged in the world for many cen∣turies.</P>
<P>He lived entirely to extinguish party and the spirit of party in his kingdoms; it was not till the close of his reign, that his family might have been considered as firmly and immovably seated on the throne; but he, having baffled all the pri∣vate machinations of his enemies
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>
policy, subdued at length the utmost effort of their force: and though on that menacing occasion, he ex∣perienced in the fullest measure the affection of his people, yet the com∣pletion of this great service to his family, he owed solely to the capa∣city and bravery of his own son.</P>
<P>He lived with his queen in that kind of harmony and confidence, that is seen between the best suited couples in private life. He had a numerous issue, in which he had great cause of satisfaction, and very little of disquiet, but what was the almost necessary consequence of a life protracted to a late period. He survived several of his children. He had the satisfaction to see in his suc∣cessor, what is very rare, the most affectionate obedience, the most du∣tiful acquiescence in his will; and what is no less rare, contrary to the fortune of most old kings, he never possessed more perfectly the love of his subjects than in the last years of his life. And he died at the very point of time when the terror of his arms, the power of his kingdoms and the wisdom of his government, were all raised to almost as high a pitch as they could possibly arrive at; they were indeed at that height of pros∣perity and glory, as never had been exceeded in the reign of the most fortunate of his predecessors.</P>
<P>His parts were not lively or bril∣liant; but the whole of his conduct demonstrates that he had a judg∣ment both solid and comprehensive. He understood the interests of the other sovereigns of Europe; and was particularly skilled in all the re∣cesses of that political labyrinth, the system of Germany; of the liber∣ties of which he was through his whole life a most zealous assertor. In the year 1741, he took up arms, and even risqued his own person, when by the projected dismember∣ment of the house of Austria, they were in danger of falling a sacrifice to a French faction. He afterwards resisted with equal firmness that very house of Austria, which he had ex∣posed his life to defend, when the li∣berties of the empire were threat∣ened from that quarter.</P>
<P>The acquisitions of his father, were by him confirmed, improved and enlarged. He was enabled by his oeconomy always to keep up a considerable body of troops in Ha∣nover; by which means, when the war broke out, there was a disci∣plined force ready to oppose the common enemy; and we do not hazard any thing in asserting, that if it had not been for the prudent foresight of that measure, the army which has since been formed, and the great things which have since been done, could never have had existence. So that if we only exa∣mine what he has done in Germany, when we reflect what enemies se∣cret and declared he had at different times to manage and to fight in that country, he must in every fair judg∣ment be allowed the greatest prince of his family.</P>
<P>He was in his temper sudden and violent; but this, though it influ∣enced his behaviour, made no im∣pression on his conduct, which was always sufficiently deliberate and at∣tentive to his own interests and those of his subjects.</P>
<P>He was plain and direct in his in∣tentions; true to his word; steady in his favour and protection to his servants, and never changed them willingly; this appeared clearly in those who served more immediately on his person, whom he scarce ever removed; but they grew old along with him, or died in their places. But having been in a sort compelled
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>
by a violent faction, to relinquish a minister for whom he had great affec∣tion, and in whom he reposed an un∣limited confidence, it afterwards be∣came a matter of more indifference to him by whom he was served in the affairs of his government.</P>
<P>He was merciful in his disposition, but not to such a degree as in any sort to encourage offences against his government. On the suppres∣sion of the rebellion in 1746, he be∣haved without any remarkable dis∣play either of severity or clemency. Many were pardoned, many punish∣ed; and this, perhaps, is the most proper conduct on such occasions, where offended majesty requires victims, justice examples, and hu∣manity pardons. But though the law in many instances had its free course, the excesses committed in the rage of war, were by him neither command∣ed nor approved. After that rebel∣lion had been suppressed, he retain∣ed no bitter remembrance of it, either to the country in which it un∣fortunately began, or even to many of the persons who were actually concerned in it.</P>
<P>As he came into England in a riper age, and of consequence never had been able to attain a perfect knowledge of the force and beauties of our language, he never shewed a sufficient regard to the English li∣terature, which in his reign did not flourish: and this must be consider∣ed as the greatest, or rather the only blemish that lay upon his go∣vernment.</P>
<P>He has been censured, as a little too attentive to money; and per∣haps in some minute things this cen∣sure was not wholly without founda∣tion. But there are two considerations which greatly enervate this objecti∣on to his character. First, that this disposition never shewed itself in one rapacious act; and 2dly, that it never influenced his conduct on any impor∣tant occasion. For it is now well known that he shewed no improper parsimony, when this war broke out. In fact, he expended so much on that occasion; that on his decease, his private wealth was found to be far inferior to what had commonly been imagined.</P>
<P>Though it is true, that during his whole life, he had shewn a re∣markable affection to his Hanove∣rian subjects, yet the last act of it demonstrated that they were far from engrossing the whole of his re∣gard; and that in reality his Ger∣man possessions held no other place in his consideration than what their relative importance to the rest of his dominions naturally claimed. For when that truly severe trial came, in which the interests of England and Hanover were separated, when a war began for an object wholly foreign to that country, a war in which Hanover must suffer much, and could hope no advantage, even there his majesty did not hesitate a moment to expose his German dominions to almost inevitable ruin, rather than make or even propose the smallest abatement from the immensity of the English rights in America. A conduct that more than wipes off every suspicion of an improper partiality; and which surely ought never to be mentioned without the highest gratitude to the memory of that magnanimous monarch.</P>
<P>If the authors of these sheets were equal to such a design, it would perhaps be impossible to exhibit a more pleasing picture than that which might be formed from a just view of his late majesty's conduct, to these two so differently constituted parts of his dominions. His virtue was
<PB N="174" REF="191"/>
proved by two of the greatest trials to which the nature of man is liable; the trust of absolute and unbounded power; and the most exalted station limited by the strictest laws. For these two so very different situa∣tions, very different and almost opposite tempers and talents have been always thought necessary. But that king had a mind per∣fectly adapted to both; for whilst in England he kept the liberties of his people inviolate, and like a wise magistrate, was satisfied to make his authority co-operate with law, and his will freely sub∣servient to the wisdom of ages, in Hanover like an indulgent father, act∣ing only from the sentiments of a pa∣ternal heart, his affection and his equity supplied the want of law and constitution. He has indeed left to his illustrious successor, an admir∣able example; which he not only promises to follow, but in many respects to exceed; and his sub∣jects take the greater interest in his virtues, as they look upon them as more peculiarly their own; and they now boast of a prince, who neither has, nor can have any partiality but the best, and who is in birth as well as inclination British.</P>
<P>As soon as his present majesty came to the throne and had met his parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Nov.</NOTE> he in the most public and so∣lemn manner confirmed the hopes of his allies, and gave the most un∣doubted assurances of his resolution to continue the war on the former plan, and with the former vigour; and he found his parliament no ways changed in their resolution of sup∣porting it with the same liberality and spirit. Insomuch that as there was no apparent change either in the system of the alliance, in the disposition of the king, or in that of the nation, or in the general plan of the war, we have only to pass again to the trans∣actions of the continent, thinking it unnecessary to apologize to our rea∣ders for having been diverted from the course of the narrative for a short time, by an event of such melan∣choly importance to Great Britain and to all Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Russians and Austrians enter Brandenburg. General Hulsen retreats from Saxony to Berlin. Evacuates it. The city capitulates. Berlin described King's palaces plundered. Enemy retires out of Brandenburg after having pillaged it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE King of Prussia's letter, with which we closed the 6th chapter, exhibited a true picture of that monarch's apprehensions; the events which immediately fol∣lowed proved that these apprehen∣sions were but too well grounded. The victory near Lignitz, indeed, gave some relief to Silesia; but whilst the enemy had so many and so numerous armies in the field, even shame independent of their in∣terest exacted from them some stroke of consequence.</P>
<P>The late manoeuvres had neces∣sarily drawn the King of Prussia in∣to the southern parts of Silesia, and consequently to a great distance from Brandenburg, with which country his communication was much interrupted, or rather wholly cut off. The Russian army, which after it had repassed the Oder at Auras, began to move out of Silesia,
<PB N="175" REF="192"/>
pushed forward a powerful detach∣ment under Count Czernichew to∣wards the March of Brandenburg. A body of 15000 Austrians under the Generals Lacy and Brentano from the army of Count Daun, and the whole united corps of Austrians and Imperialists which acted in Saxony, began their march in con∣cert with the Russians, and proposed to unite at the gates of Berlin. These armies amounted to forty thousand men.</P>
<P>General Hulsen, who was altoge∣ther too weak to oppose the Imperi∣alists in Misnia, fell back upon Ber∣lin. General Werner who had lately been sent into Pomerania, re∣turned with incredible speed and joined the troops under Hulsen; but when they viewed their com∣bined strength, they found it con∣sisted of no more than 15 or 16000 men, a force far too weak to op∣pose to those powerful armies that were marching against them. Whol∣ly unable to protect a place of such immense extent, and such imper∣fect fortification, they saw that to attempt a defence, would be only to involve the troops in the inevit∣able fate that waited the city, with∣out being able to add any thing ef∣fectual to its security; therefore after having defended it against the advanced guard of the Russians un∣der Tottleben, who attacked the gates and bombarded the town, when they found the grand armies advancing; they made their retreat; leaving only three weak battalions in the place, to enable it to make some sort of capitulation with the enemy.</P>
<P>Berlin is composed of five towns, which have stretched to each other and grown into one vast city upon the banks of the river Spree. It has been augmented to this gran∣deur, by having long been the re∣sidence of the electors of Branden∣burg and kings of Paussia, who as they have enlarged their dominions by inheritance, force, or policy, have all contributed something to the grandeur and magnificence of this their capital. The situation of the town on so noble and navigable a river as the Spree, communicating on one side with the Oder, by a canal (the most princely work of her sovereigns) and on the other falling into the Elbe, has added not a little to its extent and opulence; but that which has contributed most of all, has been the reception of the French refugees, to which this city has always been a most assured and favourable asylum, as it has also been to those protestants who have been persecuted in any part of Germany; and the present king by enlarging his plan, and imparting an extent of toleration unknown to his predeces∣sors, has also introduced Roman catholics, whom he has encouraged by suffering them to build a most magnificent church in the heart of Berlin. By this means he has brought the most opposite factions to concur in promoting the gran∣deur of his royal residence. From these causes Berlin is become one of the most considerable cities in Eu∣rope; vast in its extent; consider∣able in its commerce; and magni∣ficent beyond most others in its pub∣lic and private buildings, and the regular distribution of the streets in the new town. It had long been the seat of the greatest military arrange∣ments in the world; and it was made by the present king the seat of arts and sciences, and the place of resort
<PB N="176" REF="193"/>
of ingenious men, in every science, in every art, and from every quarter.</P>
<P>Such is Berlin, which at this time being deserted by the greatest part of its garrison, was abandoned to the mercy of a mighty army of Austrians, Russians, Saxons and Im∣perialists, animated by revenge; exasperated by injuries; and insti∣gated by avarice. Nothing could exceed the terror and consternation of the inhabitants on this occasion. They were acquainted with the sa∣vage character of one part of the enemy, and with the violent ani∣mosity of the rest; and they knew that they did not want pretences for colouring their severities, with the appearance of a just retaliation.</P>
<P>In these dispositions of the in∣habitants, the enemy approached. The garrison immediately proposed to capitulate. With respect to them, the terms were short; they were made prisoners of war. But with regard to the inhabitants, where the great danger lay, the conditions were more tolerable than they ex∣pected; they were promised the free exercise of their religion; and an immunity from violence to their goods and persons. It was also agreed that the Russian irregulars should not enter the town; and that the king's palace should be inviola∣ble. These on the whole, were favourable terms; and they were granted principally on the mediation of the foreign ministers residing in Berlin, who interposed their good offices with great zeal and humanity. The difficulty was, how to secure the observance of them.</P>
<P>These conditions being made, the army of the allied <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Oct.</NOTE> powers entered the town; totally de∣stroyed the magazines, ansenals, and founderies, seized an immense quan∣tity of military stores, and a number of cannon and arms; called first for the immediate payment of 800,000 guilders, and then laid on a con∣tribution of 1,900,000 German crowns: not satisfied with this, many irregularities were committed by the soldiery; but on the whole, though some shocking actions were committed, a far more exact disci∣pline was observed than from such troops could have been expected upon such an occasion, where there was every incentive which could work upon the licence of a con∣quering army. Their officers no doubt with great difficulty preserved even that degree of order.</P>
<P>But though their behaviour was tolerable, with regard to the private inhabitants, there was something shocking and ungenerous in their treatment of the king's palaces. The apartments of the royal castle of Charlottenburgh were entirely plun∣dered, the precious furniture spoil∣ed, the pictures defaced, without even sparing the antique statues col∣lected by Cardinal Polignac, which had been purchased by the house of Brandenburg. The castle of Schon∣housen, belonging to the queen, and that of Fredericksfeld, belong∣ing to the margrave Charles, were also plundered.</P>
<P>The palace of Potsdam, the fa∣mous Sans-souci, had a better fate; Prince Esterhasi commanded there; it was preserved from the smallest violation. The prince on viewing the palace only asked which picture of the king resembled him most, and being informed, desired that he might have leave to take it, toge∣ther with two German flutes which the king used, to keep them, he
<PB N="177" REF="194"/>
said, in memory of his majesty. This was a sort of taking very dif∣ferent from pillage.</P>
<P>They staid in the city four days, but hearing that the king, apprehen∣sive of this stroke, was moving to the relief of his capital, they quit∣ted it on the 13th of October; and having wasted the whole country round for a vast extent, and driven away all the cattle and horses they could find, retreated by different routs out of Brandenburg, leaving the people still trembling under the alarm, and hardly yet certain of their safety.</P>
<P>We do by no means undertake to authenticate the ravages which the Prussian accounts charged upon the Austrians and their allies, in this in∣cursion; nor whether they may not have been in general much exag∣gerated, or in some cases absolutely feigned. We have abundant rea∣son to suspect the exact veracity of many pieces of that nature which have been published on all sides; and which are but too frequently a sort of state libels, where the powers at war, not content to de∣stroy each other in the field, pursue their adversaries reputation, and en∣deavour mutually to paint each other as monsters equally devoid of justice and compassion. Indeed if we were to give credit to all the writings of this kind that have ap∣peared, it were hard to say which of the parties have by their con∣duct brought the greatest disgrace upon human nature. It is, how∣ever, certain, that the country of Brandenburg suffered more severely on this occasion than the city of Berlin. An ill disciplined army is al∣ways most furious in its retreat, and the country had made no condi∣tions.</P>

Battle of Torgau. M. Daun wounded. The towns in Misnia retaken. Siege of Colberg raised. Swedes driven back.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE King of Prussia at last saw his capital taken by his most cruel enemies, and put to ransom; his native country was wasted; they took up their quarters in his palaces: but this was far from the whole of his misfortunes. When Gen. Hulsen marched to cover Brandenburg, there remained no Prussian army in Saxony. So that the Imperial army on their return from Berlin, within a short time, and with little opposition, made themselves masters of Leip∣sick, Torgau, Meissen, and at last of Wittemberg; in which city they took the grand magazine of the Prussians immensely stored. The king was now totally <NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Oct.</NOTE> driven out of Saxony, in which he had no longer a single place.</P>
<P>M. Stainville with a detachment of Broglio's army, as soon as Wan∣genheim had been obliged to repass the Weser (as we have related in the seventh chapter) pushed into the King of Prussia's dominions on that side, and laid the city and dutchy of Halberstadt under contribution. In the eastern Pomerania, the Russians had invested Colberg both by land
<PB N="178" REF="195"/>
and sea, and pressed that city with a close and unremitted siege. The king could scarcely hope to relieve it. In the western Pomerania, the Swedes urged forward with uncom∣mon vigour, hoping to partake in the plunder of Berlin; and they advanced with success. In Silesia, the king had no sooner began his march to the northward, than Baron Laudohn profited of his absence to rush again into that country, and to invest the strong and important for∣tress of Cosel. Whilst the king's dominions were thus attacked in so many parts, he was himself attend∣ed every step of his march by the superior army of Count Daun, who moved along with him and watch∣ed him with the most attentive vi∣gilance. His condition seemed ex∣tremely to resemble that to which he had been reduced in the autumn immediately preceding the battle of Rosbach. In Silesia, his condition was at that time worse; but he was then in the possession of Saxony, of which in this campaign he was wholly de∣prived.</P>
<P>Saxony was, however, still his great object, and knowing that the enemy had evacuated Brandenburg on his approach, he left that coun∣try on his right, and continued his march to the Elbe, which he pass'd on the 25th of October. M. Daun passed it the same day. The two champions were to engage once more for the so often contended prize; but now every disadvantage was on the side of the King of Prussia, who had no longer any place of strength in that country, and all the magazines he had amassed were in the hands of the enemy. But being joined by his generals Hulsen and P. Eugene of Wirtemberg, with the corps under their command, he advanced up the Elbe, whilst M. Daun fell back to cover Leipsic and Torgau; but finding the Prussians directed their march towards the Elbe, he encamped within reach of Torgau, one part of his army ex∣tending to the Elbe, by which he was covered on that side, and whilst he was protected on every other quarter by ponds, hills, and woods, it was impossible to chuse a more advantageous situation, in which above 80,000 men were posted with every precaution that could be taken by a weak army in the most unlucky position.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia was ex∣tremely sensible of the strength, the advantageous posture, and the pre∣cautions of M. Daun; he could have no hope of drawing that wary commander from his post; and yet he saw a necessity of fighting him even there. The winter was now far advanced. His troops were ex∣tremely harassed by such long and rapid marches: and he had no place for their winter-quarters but his own country, already wasted by the ene∣mies incursions; and here streighten∣ed for subsistence, cut off from all power of recruiting, he was to ex∣pect to be attacked, as it were, in a narrow corner by the combined force of so many powerful and ex∣asperated enemies.</P>
<P>In these circumstances he was re∣solved to come to a battle. He caused his army to be informed that he was to lead them to a most des∣perate attempt, that his affairs re∣quired it, and that he was deter∣mined to conquer or die in the ex∣pected engagement. They unani∣mously answered, that they would die along with him.</P>
<P>Animated by this decla∣ration he began his march; <NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Nov.</NOTE>
<PB N="179" REF="196"/>
but having taken a resolution as dar∣ing as could be dictated by despair, he made all the dispositions with as much skill and care as could be sug∣gested by the most guarded pru∣dence. He divided his army into three columns; General Hulsen with one was to take post in a wood that lay on the left of the Austrian army, and had orders not to move until he found the rest of the Prussians en∣gaged. General Ziethen was to charge on the right; the great at∣tack in front was to be made by the king in person. The king had disposed his force in such a man∣ner, that either his right or left must take the enemy in rear and close them in, so as to disable them from undertaking any thing against the part where he intended to effect his principal attack. This was the king's disposition.</P>
<P>M. Daun as soon as he perceived that the King of Prussia was serious in his resolution of fighting, to pre∣vent confusion, sent all his baggage over the Elbe, across which he threw three bridges to be ready in case a re∣treat should be found necessary. At the same time he caused Torgau to be evacuated. And then extending his first line to a village called Zinne on the left, he stretched it to another called Groswitz on the right; sup∣porting the right of his second line, upon the Elbe.</P>
<P>In this disposition he was found when about two o'clock in the afternoon, the King began his attack, and was received with the fire of two hundred pieces of cannon, which were disposed along the Austrian front. Three times the Prussians were led on; they persevered in their attacks with uncommon resolution, but were every time repulsed and broken with a most terrible slaughter. The king at length ordered a fresh body of his cavalry to advance, which at first compelled the Austrians to give way; but as fresh reinforce∣ments were continually poured on that part, this cavalry was in its turn obliged to fall back, and the battle still remained at least du∣bious, or rather inclined against the King of Prussia, whose troops, as they had made astonishing efforts, so they suffered beyond all descrip∣tion. But whilst the Prussians sustain∣ed themselves in that quarter with such extreme difficulty, General Zie∣then, with the right wing took the enemy in the rear, repulsed them and possessed himself of some emi∣nences which commanded the whole Austrian army. Encouraged by this success the Prussian infantry once more advanced, mastered several of the enemy's intrenchments, and made way for a new attack of their cavalry, which broke in with irresis∣tible impetuosity upon the Austrians, and threw several bodies of them in∣to irreparable disorder. It was now about nine o'clock, the two armies were involved in a pitchy dark∣ness; yet the fire continued with∣out intermission, and the battalions with a blind rage discharged at each other without distinguishing friend or foe.</P>
<P>M. Daun did every thing in the disposition and the action, that be∣came his high character. But he was obliged to yield to the mi∣raculous fortune of the King of Prussia. He received a dangerous wound on the thigh, and was car∣ried from the field, which probably disheartened the troops, and has∣tened the defeat. The command then fell on the Count O'Donnel, who finding a great part of his
<PB N="180" REF="197"/>
troops in disorder, the night ad∣vanced, and the enemy possessed of eminences which commanded his camp, and of which it was vain to think of dispossessing them, order∣ed a retreat, which was conducted in this darkness and across the Elbe with wonderful order; none were lost in passing the bridges, and far the greater part of their artillery was preserved. The Prussians re∣mained masters of this well-fought and bloody field. The darkness hindered them from molesting the enemies retreat or improving their victory, which they bought at the expence of ten thousand killed and wounded, and about three thousand prisoners. But even with this loss, the advantage was well purchased: it was a necessary and a glorious victory. It re-established the re∣putation of their arms; it secured their winter-quarters; and gave them again the possession of a great part of Saxony.</P>
<P>Probably of all the King of Prus∣sia's battles, this was the most im∣portant; and it was that in the con∣duct of which he shewed the great∣est skill, intrepidity, and perseve∣rance. His troops behaved with a firmness which would have done honour to those which he formerly led into Bohemia. In this action where they were to surmount every obstacle and encounter every diffi∣culty and danger in order to attack so great and excellent an army as the Austrian, under such an ac∣complished commander as M. Daun, their number did not exceed fifty thousand men.</P>
<P>The loss of the Austrians was very great; the number killed and wounded is not indeed accurately known. Probably it did not much, if at all exceed the loss on the side of the victorious army; but the prisoners were far more numerous, two hundred and sixteeen officers of the Austrians were taken, among whom were four generals, together with eight thousand of the common sort. The king in this battle, in which he every moment exposed his life to the greatest dangers, received a slight contusion in his breast by a musket shot.</P>
<P>The Austrians disputed the victo∣ry in the Gazettes. But the King of Prussia reaped all the fruits of it; he recovered all Saxony except Drefden; it had been the ex∣tremity of rashness to have com∣menced the siege of that place in the depth of winter, and in the sight of an army strongly posted, and which though it had been beaten continued after its defeat, more nu∣merous than his own. His troops had already sustained fatigues almost be∣yond human strength; and the most prudent part now left was to per∣mit them to enjoy a little repose; and in the interval of action to prepare, by employing the means his victory had put into his hands, for the arduous work of the ensuing campaign.</P>
<P>Indeed the face of the Prussian af∣fairs had been prodigiously changed since the day in which their enemies had entered Berlin. It was observed that the taking of that city had been before this ominous to the Austrian cause: and that General Haddick's expedition against it in 1757, had been followed by the victories of Rosbach and Lissa, as this irruption was by that of Tor∣gau. There was some difference between the former victories and the latter. But the Prussians drew motives of consolation and hope from these coincidences. There was also something solid in the ad∣vantages
<PB N="181" REF="198"/>
they had acquired. After the King of Prussia's march had delivered Berlin, General Werner marched into Pomerania; and on his approach, together with that of Win∣ter, the Russians raised the siege of Colberg, (which they had kept so long blocked up by sea and land) and then retired into Poland, not having been able to effect in Pomerania by the operations of the whole year, more than the devastation of the open country. Then Werner having freed the Eastern, flew to the relief of the Western Pomerania, where the suc∣cess was as rapid, and more brilliant. He defeated a body of Swedes which was posted near Passewalk, compel∣led them to retire with the loss of a thousand men, in killed and pri∣soners; and pursuing his advantage with spirit, the Swedes were at length compelled to evacuate the Prussian Pomerania, and to fall back upon Stralsund.</P>
<P>All the armies of the Russians at length quitted the king's territories. General Laudohn abruptly raised the blockade of Cosel; and afterwards abandoning Landshut, he retired in∣to the Austrian Silesia, and left all the Prussian part in quiet. M. Daun after the battle of Torgau, seeing the King of Prussia at∣tempt nothing against Dresden, placed one part of his army in that city, and cantoned the rest in those strong posts which lie to the south and west of it, by which he com∣manded the Elbe and kept open his communication with Bohemia. The army of the empire retired into Fran∣conia, and placed its head quarters at Bamberg.</P>
<P>The King of Prussia omitted nothing to re-establish his affairs; and the recovery of Saxony gave him great opportunities for that purpose. We may judge of the importance of that possession by the resources he was able to draw from it. He demanded of the circle of Leipsick for the contributions of the ensuing year, two millions of crowns, exclusive of the ordinary revenue, together with a vast quantity of forage and provision. From all the other parts of Mis∣nia which he held he exacted in the same proportion. He compel∣led them also to supply a vast num∣ber of recruits: his demand was twenty thousand; and though it be certain that they could not supply so many, yet he was enabled by the re∣cruits furnished by Saxony alone, entirely to fill up the breaches which the battle of Torgau had made in his battalions. He drew also vast resources from the duchy of Meck∣lenburgh, which he taxed at some millions of crowns, an immense quantity of provision, and a great number of recruits. These he in∣sisted either on receiving immediately, or that the duke should enter his troops into the Prussian service. It is said that his majesty then made some sort of treaty or composition with the duke, whose condition has been from the beginning of the war, the worst that can be imagined. For his situation is such, just behind the Prussian dominions, and out of all possibility of communication with the grand armies of his allies, that he cannot be benefited by any advantages which they ac∣quire; on the contrary, he suffers almost equally, whether the King of Prussia be victorious or defeated; and his dominions must furnish the means of improving the king's victories, and repairing his losses. If the King of Prussia has made a treaty with this prince, there is no doubt
<PB N="182" REF="199"/>
that it is almost wholly in his majesty's favour, and that he has taken care that he shall not draw much less pro∣fit from the Duke of Mecklenburg as an ally, than he had derived from him as an enemy.</P>
<P>In short, with regard to ex∣tent of possession, the King of Prus∣sia is much in the same situation in which he was left at the closing the foregoing campaign; but in all other respects his condition is infinitely pre∣ferable. He had then indeed the same possessions in Saxony; but he closed that campaign with the loss of two battles, destructive in them∣selves, and disgraceful in their cir∣cumstances: he closed this by a most beneficial and most glorious victory, by which the reputation of his arms, greatly tarnished, was restored to its former brightness, and which in its consequences has given him as fair a prospect of success as he can have, whilst the alliance against him is not in the least degree weakened by the falling off of the most inconsiderable member, or the abatement of the smallest degree of their animosity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>The Allies raise the siege of Gottingen. Winter quarters and sufferings of the British troops. Popular debates in England concerning the German war.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE allied army in Westpha∣lia after their failure on the lower Rhine, turned their attention to the eastward of the Weser, and made a vigorous attempt upon Got∣tingen, which from the 22d of No∣vember, until the 12th of the fol∣lowing month, they kept blockaded. But the French made a brave de∣fence, and having taken a strong post of the allies in a fally, they compelled them to raise the block∣ade. They were before heartily weary of it, having suffered incre∣dible hardships, both in this and all the other services of the cam∣paign, in which they had so often traversed that great tract of coun∣try which lies between the Maine, the Weser, and the Rhine: and though the winter continued very temperate and open, such unusual rains had fallen, that the waters were every where out, and the roads so damag∣ed, that their provisions could scarce∣ly arrive, or their communication be preserved.</P>
<P>At length therefore, they sub∣mitted to go into winter quarters, leaving the French in possession of Hesse, and the whole country east∣ward of the Weser to the frontiers of the electorate: by which they communicated with the Austrians and Imperialists, and prevented the succours with which the King of Prussia, after the battle of Torgau, had intended to reinforce the al∣lied army. The English troops were cantoned for the winter, in the bishopric of Paderborn; and Lord Granby established his head∣quarters in the city of that name. But these quarters proved a very in∣different place of repose for the British troops, worn out with the fatigues of so labourious a campaign, partly from the natural penury of the country; and partly from the vast numbers to be supported, at a time when the sphere of their sub∣sistence was extremely streightened; and even that narrow sphere ex∣hausted by having been four years
<PB N="183" REF="200"/>
the seat of war. This scarcity was increased by the difficulty of the roads, and probably in some de∣gree by the avarice of contractors, over whom, several were of opini∣on, as strict a watch had not been kept, as is at all times necessary for that sort of people.</P>
<P>But whatever were the causes of this scarcity; it was bitterly felt by the troops, and was accompanied by diseases which thinned them ex∣tremely. This raised a general dis∣content in the army, which was speedily communicated to England, where the people during the pre∣ceding year, not having been struck with those brilliant advantages which distinguish an offensive cam∣paign, did not confine their com∣plaints to the conduct of the war, but began to fall into an almost ge∣neral dislike of the very system upon which it was pursued.</P>
<P>Much of the old dispute between the naval and continental schemes was renewed; and enforced with many additional topics. The al∣liances of the war in Germany were severely criticised. "We are pur∣suing, said they, a system, by which we must certainly lose all the ad∣vantages which we acquired for the short time we followed one that was more national, and suitable to our circumstances; a system of all others the most absurd; a system in which defeats are attended with their usual fatal effects, and in which even victory itself cannot save us from ruin. We will not enter, said they, into that long and vainly agitated question, Whether we ought to take any part in the differences which may arise between the powers on the continent? This disquisition is foreign to the present purpose; and it is besides of too vague and general a nature to admit any pre∣cise determination; but this un∣doubtedly may be asserted, that we can never, consistently with com∣mon prudence, engage in a conti∣nental war against France, without a concurrence in our favour of the other powers on the continent. This was the continental scheme of the great King William; and this principle the foundation of the grand alliance which he projected, and at the head of which, in de∣fence of the liberties of Europe, he made the most august appearance to which human nature can be rais∣ed. It was on this principle, that in conjunction with half Europe, we carried on the war with so much honour and success against France, under the Duke of Marlbo∣rough. But to engage in a conti∣nental war with that power, not only unassisted but opposed by the greatest part of those states with whom we were then combined, is an attempt never to be justified by any comparative calculation of the populousness, the revenues, or the general strength of the two nations. It is a desperate struggle, which must finally end in our ruin.</P>
<P>But what is the scene which we have chosen for this struggle? We have chosen Germany; the very spot of all others which the French, if they had their choice, would have pointed out to us. By mak∣ing Germany the theatre of war, they see that country wasted and destroyed, the strength of which has always proved the greatest bul∣wark against their overbearing am∣bition. They see the swords of the Germans, from one end to the other of that vast and populous country, turned against each other; and they see with joy the English, whose in∣terest
<PB N="184" REF="201"/>
it is to save them as much as possible, co-operating with her blood and her treasures, to com∣pleat the disunion, and consequent∣ly the desolation of Germany. In a war in that country France has many advantages: she supports her armies in a great degree by pillag∣ing those whom in every respect it is her interest to weaken. She is not very remote from her own frontiers, from whence she is easily provided, easily recruited; and by means of which a great part of the public money is expended in the country where it is raised. Is she unsuccessful? she is brought thereby but the nearer to her fron∣tier, supports her troops with still the greater facility, and exhausts still less the natural wealth of her people. Even suppose the French army dri∣ven into France; even then these advantages on her side are increased; and very obvious circumstances ren∣der it impossible for the allied ar∣my to push their success on the Ger∣man frontiers of France to any de∣cisive consequence.</P>
<P>But to the English, every thing is unfavourable in such a war; their greatest successes will only carry them to greater distance from their resources, and every step of their pro∣gress must make the transport of pro∣vision, artillery, ammunition, and the infinite impediments of a large army more difficult, and in the end altogether impracticable. This is not speculation; the events which followed the battle of Cre∣velt have proved it. Prince Fer∣dinand, victorious in that action, was obliged, rather from the diffi∣culty of subsisting, than the superi∣ority of the enemy, to repass the Rhine, and to bring back to Ger∣many that war with which he threatned France. It is thus, that upon this plan, victory itself cannot save us, and that all our successes serve only to accumulate new dis∣tresses, new difficulties, new charges. Whilst France, who has only con∣tracted her expences by the loss of her navy, encourages us to enter deeper and deeper into the inextri∣cable toils of a German war, in which we waste our strength only to entangle ourselves further. She holds the strings, and can never be tired out at this game. From all this arises an expence unknown even in thought to our forefathers, and which the single revenue of Eng∣land is by no means able to bear. The allies, if they deserve the name, supply not the smallest part of it. The Hanoverians and Hessians con∣tribute to our service only by en∣abling us to protract still longer our efforts in a system, in which nothing can so effectually serve us as being defeated as early as possible.</P>
<P>As to the King of Prussia, what we pay to that monarch, may ra∣ther be considered as tribute than subsidy; since we receive nothing in return: and that far from being able to afford any relief to our ar∣mies, he is scarcely in a condition to support himself. So that this al∣liance is worse than the former, as it is an heavy charge compensated not only with no real, but even with no apparent or shewy advan∣tage. Indeed, he is an ally the last in the world we ought to have chosen, on account of his long con∣nection with our worst enemies, the mean and the hostile sentiments he has always entertained towards us, the injuries he has done us, and the general lightness of his faith with re∣gard to his former allies. We re∣gard him, it is true, as the protec∣tor of the protestant religion; but how lightly he thinks of all religi∣on
<PB N="185" REF="202"/>
his writings testify; and what mischiefs he has done the protes∣tant cause in particular, this war will be a lasting memorial. When he entered Saxony, a protestant country, he found that religion no ways molested in those places, where it had been established or tolerated by the treaty of West∣phlia. Even in the popish do∣mmions the persecution began to lose something of its edge, when he under the name of its protector, brought upon it as great a calamity as its most determined enemies could have wished; by dividing the re∣formed states of the empire, and setting protestants to cut the throats of protestants, whilst all the popish powers have been forced into a strict confederacy.</P>
<P>Had we kept ourselves clear of this ruinous system; and instead of engaging France on her strong side, attacked and vanquished her colonies, one after another, we might without exhausting our own strength have gradually wasted away the principal resources of her trade, and whilst we continued this me∣thod, have as little reason to grow tired of a war (the whole funds of which would be spent at home) as France has to grow weary in the pre∣sent manner of carrying it on. If the powers on the continent were left without our interposition to do their own business, they would pro∣bably better understand and better defend their own rights. At worst let France enter, let them conquer, let them possess Hanover; there is no mischief they can do that country greater than it suffers by the present war; and we not exhausting our∣selves by a fruitless defence, should in the end by the entire posses∣sion of the French colonies, be able, besides the security of our own just claims, to restore the Hanoverian dominions to their lawful sovereign, and even to procure some indemni∣fication for what they might have suffered in our quarrel."</P>
<P>This is pretty nearly the sub∣stance of what was urged against the German system; and the argument was conducted with great ma∣nagement and address, and inter∣spersed with a number of topics well calculated to spread discontent, and to place in an odious light every step taken in those alliances and in that war. Many, however, strongly adhered to that method, and they answered "That the best reasons on the other side were more specious than solid; and that the chief writings against our German connections were declamations ra∣ther than arguments. That the complaint of the expence of this war was in some measure just; but if the advantage was in any degree equivalent, the expence was incur∣red to good purpose. That France by engaging so heartily as she has done in the German war, has drawn away so much of her attention and her revenue from her navy, that it enabled us to give such a blow to her maritime strength, as possibly she may never be able to recover. Her engagement in the German war, has likewise drawn her from the defence of her colonies, by which means we have conquered some of the most considerable she possessed. It has withdrawn her from the protection of her trade, by which it is entirely destroyed, whilst that of England has never in the profoundest peace been in so flourish∣ing a condition. So that by em∣barking in this German war, France has suffered herself to be
<PB N="186" REF="203"/>
undone, so far as regards her par∣ticular and immediate quarrel with England. But has she had in Ger∣many such successes as will counter∣ballance this loss? Far from it. At this moment she is infinitely less ad∣vanced than she was the year she en∣tered Germany, after having spent such immense sums of money, and lost by the sword, by disease, and by desertion, at least 100,000 of her people.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the account stands thus with regard to England; deeply embarked as she has been in this German war, in her particular quarrel with France, she has been carried along with an almost unin∣terrupted tide of success. She has taken many of the French colonies; she has destroyed their navy and their trade, and having insulted the enemies coasts, has ruined an har∣bour which might one day prove very obnoxious to us. Then how stands the account in Germany? The French have been there frequently defeated; Hanover has been recover∣ed and protected; the K. of Prussia has been preserved so long at least from the rage of his enemies, and in general the liberty of Germany has been hitherto secured. So that if we have incurred a great expence, we have done by it infinitely more than France has done at an ex∣pence much greater than ours. For the advocates who declaim against the King of Prussia, seem to have forgot that the charge of the French army must exceed ours, as the num∣ber of their troops to be paid, ex∣ceeds the difference between French and English pay. Those on the English establishment in Germany, have at no time exceeded 25000 and the rest of the confederates serve very nearly on the same terms with the French. Not to mention the subsidies so greatly superior to ours, which that power pays to states from whom she has not a single regiment to augment her armies. Thus although by our victories France is relieved from the charge of her navy, and that of the defence of some of her most considerable colonies, the German war alone has brought her finances to a distress of which the whole world has been witness. And nothing less could have happened; the expence how∣ever contracted was still enormous; and the resource of every war, trade, was almost wholly destroyed. In England, the expence was also undoubtedly great: but then, the old trade still remained to supply it, and new channels were opened. Had we lain by and tamely beheld Germany in part possessed, and the rest compelled to receive laws from France, the war there would soon have been brought to an end; and France, strengthened by victory, by conquest and alliance, would have the whole force and whole revenue of her mighty monarchy free to act against us alone.</P>
<P>They argued further, that com∣mon faith obliged us to an adhe∣rence to our engagements both with Hanover nnd Prussia; and that the pleaded incapacity to assist them arising from the greatness of the charge could not excuse us; be∣cause the incapacity was not real; and if the expence were inconveni∣ent, we ought to have looked to that when we contracted our en∣gagements. That it was not true, that we received no advantage from our alliance with the King of Prussia; for if it be once admitted, that we entered with any reason in∣to the German war (which they sup∣posed
<PB N="187" REF="204"/>
proved) then the King of Prussia has been very materially ser∣viceable to us; because it was his victory at Rosbach, and the rein∣forcement from his troops, which has enabled us to do all that has since been atchieved. In the like man∣ner, if the support of the protestant religion be any part of our care, that religion must suffer eminently by the ruin of the King of Prussia; for though the writings attributed to his Prussian majesty be such, as if really his, reflect on account of their impiety great disgrace on his character as a man, yet as a king, in his public and political capacity, he is the natural protector of the protestant religion in Germany; and it will always be his interest to defend it."</P>
<P>We shall not presume to deter∣mine, which party has the right side of this question; it was once undoubtedly a question very fit to be discussed with great care; but having chosen our party, it is at present little more than a matter of political speculation.</P>

<P>BEfore we resume the account of the war in America, it will be necessary to take some notice of the attempt of the celebrated Thurot. It happened much earlier in the year, than the events which we have just related. But to avoid breaking the thread of the more important events in Germany, we have reserved it for this place.</P>
<P>The reader will remember, that in the French scheme for invading these islands, (which was described as it then appeared to us in the 4th chapter of the annals of 1759.) a small squadron was prepared at Dunkirk, under Monsieur Thurot, the destination of which most people at that time imagined to have been for Scotland. But, it has since ap∣peared, that this little squadron was intended to make a diversion on the north coast of Ireland, whilst the grand fleet under Monsieur de Con∣flans, made the principal descent in some of the southern parts of that kingdom. The manner in which the latter and principal part of this project failed, has already been re∣lated among the transactions of that year. It remains now to give some account of the part in which Thurot was concerned.</P>
<P>His squadron, consisting of five frigates, on board of which were 1270 land soldiers, sailed from the port of Dunkirk on the 5th of Oc∣tober 1759. They had been blocked up until that time by an English fleet; but under favour of an hazy night, they put out to sea, and ar∣rived at Gottenburg in Sweden ten days after. From thence they made to Bergen in Norway. In these voyages, the men were reduced by sickness, and the vessels themselves
<PB N="188" REF="205"/>
had so suffered by storms, that they were obliged to send one of the most considerable of them back to France. It was not until the 5th of Decem∣ber, that they were able to sail di∣rectly for their place of destination. But their old ill fortune pursued them with fresh disappointments. For near three months they beat backward and forward amongst the western isles of Scotland, having in vain attempted a convenient land∣ing near Derry. In this tedious in∣terval they suffered every possible hardship. Their men were thinned and disheartened. Another of their ships was separated from them, of which they never heard more. The now remaining three were extreme∣ly shattered, and their crews suf∣fered extremely by famine. This obliged them to put into the isle of Ilay; where they re∣fitted <NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Feb.</NOTE> and took in some cattle and provisions, which were liberally paid for by the generous adventurer who commanded, and who behaved in all respects with his usual courtesy and humanity.</P>
<P>Here they heard for the first time of the defeat of Conflans's squadron. This was a circumstance of great discouragement. But as Thurot could not be sure that this intelli∣gence was not given to deceive him; he persisted in his resolution to sail for Ireland. Indeed he had scarce∣ly any other choice; for he was so poorly victualled, that he could not hope without some refreshment, to get back to France. And he was further urged on by his love of glory, no small share of which he was cer∣tain to add to his character, if he could strike a blow of never so little importance on the coast of Ireland; For by this he might make some ap∣pearance of having revenged the many insults which had been offered to the coast of France.</P>
<P>Full of these ideas, he arrived be∣fore the town of Carrickfergus on the 28th of February; and landed his troops, now reduced to about 600 men, the day following. They were augmented by draughts from his seamen to near a thousand. These he formed on the beach, and moved to the attack of the town. Carrickfergus is surrounded by an old wall ruinous in many places. Colonel Jennings commanded a∣bout four companies in the town, mostly of new raised men, extreme∣ly ill provided with ammunition, and no way prepared for this at∣tack, which they had not the small∣est reason to expect. However, they shut the gates, sent off the French prisoners to Belfast, and took all the measures their circumstances would admit. The enemy advanc∣ed and attacked the gates. There was no cannon; but the gates were defended with effect by musquet shot, until the ammunition was spent. Then the garrison retired into the castle, which having a breach in the wall near 50 feet in extent, was no ways tenable. They there∣fore surrendered prisoners of war with terms of safety for the town.</P>
<P>Thurot as soon as he was master of Carrickfergus, issued orders to Bel∣fast to send him a quantity of wine and provision; he made the same demand to the magistrates of Car∣rickfergus, which they having im∣prudently refused to comply with, the town was plundered. Thurot having victualled, and gained as much reputation by this action as could be expected from a fleet which was no more than a sort of wreck of the grand enterprise, set sail for France. But he had not left
<PB N="189" REF="206"/>
the bay of Carrickfergus many hours, when near the coast of the Isle of Man, he perceived three sail that bore down upon him. These were three English frigates which happened to be in the harbour of Kinsale, when Thurot made his descent; the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant, dispatch∣ed orders to the commander of the frigates to go in quest of the French armament. The English frigates were one of 36 guns commanded by Capt. Elliot; and two of thirty-two.</P>
<P>Such was their diligence and suc∣cess, that they overtook Thurot's squadron before they could get out of the Irish sea. They were ex∣actly three frigates to three. The French ships were much the larger, and their men much more numer∣ous; but both ships and men were in a bad condition. A sharp and close engagement began. None of the French could possibly escape, and they must take or be taken. Thurot did all that could be expected from the intrepidity of his character; he fought his ship until she had her hold almost filled with water, and her decks covered with dead bodies. At length he was killed. The crew of his ship, and by her example those of the other two, dispirited by this blow, and pressed with un∣common alacrity by the signal bra∣very of Captain Elliot, and those who commanded under him, struck, and were carried into Ram∣say Bay in the Isle of Man. Even this inconsiderable action ad∣ded to the glory of the English arms. None had been better con∣ducted, or fought with greater reso∣lution. This sole insult on our coasts was severely punished; and not a vessel concerned in it escaped. The public indeed lamented the death of the brave Thurot, who even whilst he commanded a pri∣vateer, fought less for plunder than honour; whose behaviour was on all occasions full of humanity and generosity; and whose undaunted courage raised him to rank, and merited distinction. His death secured the glory he always sought: he did not live to be brought a pri∣sonet into England; or to hear in France those malignant criticisms, which so often attend unfortunate bravery. This was the fate of the last remaining branch of that grand armament, which had so long been the hope of France, the alarm of England, and the object of general attention to all Europe.</P>
<P>In America, the French had no great reason to boast of their suc∣cess. The action of Sillery only gained them, by an immense effusion of their blood, a victory which was attended with no advantageous consequences. Vaudreuil the go∣vernor of Canada, after Levy had been compelled to raise the siege of Quebec, fixed his head-quarters at Montreal, to make if possible a last stand in that place; for which purpose he carried in all his posts; and here he collected the whole re∣gular force that remained in Canada. At the same time he sought to keep up the spirits of the people by va∣rious rumours and devices, by which he practised on their credu∣lity; one of these artifices is curi∣ous enough; the reader will find it among the state papers. But Monsieur Vaudreuil's greatest hope, was not in his artifices, nor his force, but in the situation of Ca∣nada, which is much harder to be entered, than when the enemy has entered it, to be conquered. On the side where the most considerable part of the British force was to act
<PB N="190" REF="207"/>
it is covered with vast impenetrable woods, morasses, and mountains; the only tolerable entrance to an army, is by the river St. Laurence; and the navigation of this river is rendered extremely difficult and hazardous by the number of shal∣lows, rifts and falls, that lye be∣tween the discharge of Ontario and the isle of Montreal. Vaudreuil was in expectation, that the pre∣parations necessary for conduct∣ing an army thro' such a long and difficult way, would necessarily con∣sume so much of the summer, as not to leave sufficient time for the operations absolutely necessary to reduce the remainder of Canada. He did not apprehend much danger from the garrison of Quebec, which had been weakened by its defeat in the spring. These considerations gave him some confidence that he might protract the war somewhat longer, and another year might possibly give fortune an opportunity to take some turn in his favour.</P>
<P>But Mr. Amherst, whose calm and steady resolution no dif∣ficulties could overcome, was tak∣ing the most effectual measures to defeat his expectations. His plan was disposed in this manner. Brigadier General Murray had or∣ders to advance towards Montreal, on his side, with all the troops which could be spared from the garrison of Quebec. Colonel Haviland sail∣ed from Crown Point, and took pos∣session of the Isle au Noix, which had been abandoned by the enemy on the 28th of August, and from thence had orders to proceed di∣rectly to the city of Montreal. His own army, consisting of about 10,000 men, he proposed to trans∣port by the way of Lake Ontario into the river St. Laurence. Thus he proposed entirely to surround the last place of importance which the enemy possessed, and by the motion of the three armies, in three such different routs, to render it impossible for them to form an ef∣fectual opposition to any of his corps.</P>
<P>Having laid this general plan, he left Shenectady on <NOTE PLACE="marg">21. June.</NOTE> the frontiers of New York, and pas∣sed up the Mohawks river and down that of the Oneidas, to Oswego, where he arrived on the 9th of July. The army he had collected there, consisted of about 10,000 men, re∣gulars and provincials. Sir William Johnson brought a thousand savages of the Iroquois or five nations; the greatest number of that race of men which was ever seen in arms in the cause of England.</P>
<P>It was a matter of the greatest difficulty to transport so numerous an army, the whole of its artillery, its ammunition, and all its provi∣sion, over the expanse of that vast lake in open boats and gallies; it required the greatest caution and the exactest order, lest they should fall foul upon one another, lest they should be driven out too far to gain the land on the first threatening of a storm, or lest they should come too near the shore. But all the dispositions were made in the most admirable method, and with that regularity of military arrangement, which makes so considerable a part of the character of that able com∣mander. So that the whole army embarked on the 10th of August. A detachment had been sent some days before to clear the passage of the river St. Laurence of any ob∣struction, and to find the best passage for the vessels.</P>
<P>On the 27th he had entered that
<PB N="191" REF="208"/>
river, taken possession of Swegatchie, and made all dispositions for the at∣tack of L'Isle Royale, a fort lower down in the river which command∣ed it, and by this command is the most important post, and as it were the key of Canada. The troops and boats were so disposed, that the isle was completely invested, and the garrison was left no means of es∣cape. The batteries were then raised and opened, and after two days sharp firing, the fort surrendered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Aug.</NOTE></P>
<P>This being a post of importance both to command Lake Ontario and to cover our frontier, the ge∣neral spent some days here in order to repair the fort, and at the same time to fit out his vessels, and to prepare all things for passing his troops down the river, the most dangerous part of which he was now to encounter, as all the rapids lie between this place and Montreal; but notwithstanding all precautions near ninety men were drowned in passing these dangerous falls, and a great number of vessels broke to pieces. This loss from so large an embarkation, in such circumstances, is to be regarded as very inconsider∣able. At length, after a tedious, fatiguing and dangerous voyage of <NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Sept.</NOTE> two months and seventeen days since they left Senec∣tady, the English saw to their great joy, the isle of Montreal, the object of their ardent wishes, and the pe∣riod of their labours.</P>
<P>They were immediately landed in the best order; and all dispositions were made for attacking the place. So excellently was this plan con∣certed, and so faithfully executed, that General Murray landed from Quebec that very day; and Col. Haviland with his army from Isle au Noix the day following.</P>
<P>Montreal is the second place in Canada for extent, building, traffick, and strength. Its middle situation between the lakes and Quebec, hath made it the staple of the Indian trade; but the fortifications before this war were mean and inconsi∣derable; something has been since added; but nothing made the taking of it an enterprise of difficulty, except that here was collected the whole regular, and no small part of the provincial, force which remain∣ed in Canada. However, by the dispositions which at once brought against them three armies, the greatest part and the flower of the British troops in America, Mons. Vaudreuil saw himself entirely en∣closed; he despaired of defending the place; and therefore surrendered the garrison of Montreal as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were not in strictness prisoners; but sent to France with condition not to serve during the war. The conditions may be seen more at large among the State Papers.</NOTE> priso∣ners of war, and the inhabitants of his government as subjects to the King of Great Britain on the 8th of Sep∣tember 1760.</P>
<P>And thus in the sixth year of the war, and after the most se∣vere struggles, was the vast country of Canada reduced to the king's obedience. In this time six battles had been fought, the fortune of which was equally divided; in three the French had been victorious; in three the English. The first of those in which the French had the better, was fought in the meadows near Fort du Quesne, where General Braddock was killed; the other at Ticonderoga, where General Aber∣crombie commanded; the third at
<PB N="192" REF="209"/>
Sillery, where General Murray was repulsed. The victories of the English were, 1st. that near Crown Point, where General Johnson com∣manded, and Dieskau was made pri∣soner; the 2d near Niagara, where General Johnson also commanded; and the 3d and principal near Quebec, where Wolfe gained the victory and lost his life. From the English two forts had been taken, Oswego and Fort William-Henry. The English on their side took three cities; Louisbourg, Quebec and Montreal; and five principal forts, which commanded as many im∣portant communications, Beause∣jour, Niagara, Frontenac, Ticon∣deroga, Crown Point, and Isle-Royal; besides some others of in∣ferior consideration.</P>
<P>Taking the whole war in A∣merica into one view, Canada had been defended with bravery and conduct sufficient to crown the ge∣nerals Wolfe and Amherst, and the admirals Boscawen and Saunders, who finally reduced it, with the greatest glory. And without question, the conduct of General Amherst in his last expedition, by which he obliged Montreal to surrender without a blow, and finally conquered Ca∣nada without effusion of blood, deserves every honour and every recompence a grateful people can bestow. The humanity with which he behaved to the conquered both French and Indians, though the one had perpetrated, and the other at least connived at the most hor∣rid cruelties on the English pri∣soners, adds a high lustre to his conquest. His troops set not one house on fire, not one habitation was plundered, not one man was killed (except in the attack of Isle-Royal). None was more distin∣guished in this respect than Sir William Johnson; he led into Ca∣nada an army of a thousand of the fiercest and most cruel savages which are bred in America, without doing the smallest damage to the country, or offering the slightest injury to the persons of the inhabitants. To ef∣fect this he was obliged to exert the most unwearied endeavours, and the whole of those uncommon ta∣lents which give him such power over the minds of all sorts of men. The great victories by which he has advanced the interest of the na∣tion, have done him less honour than this conduct, by which he has so greatly advanced its character for humanity and moderation. It were to be wished that the same might be said of the army, which marched from Quebec; who finding that the inhabitants in some parts were out in arms, were under a necessity of setting fire to the villages; the ten∣derness of Gen. Murray's nature re∣volted when the giving such orders became a necessary part of his duty. In the course of this sum∣mer, Lord Byron with three <NOTE PLACE="marg">9 July.</NOTE> of his majesty's ships destroyed a set∣tlement of French, where none had ever been suspected, in the Bay de Chaleurs. There he also took three frigates; and about twenty sail of vessels which contained a reinforcement of troops and military stores for the relief of Montreal; but when they had received intelli∣gence that Lord Colville's fleet had got into the river before them, and of course entirely commanded it, they disembarked in this place to at∣tempt, if possible, a way to their principal army by land. But they were discovered; the whole arma∣ment was taken; and the whole de∣sign disconcerted.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="210"/>
Before we take our leave of the American affairs of this year, we ought to make some mention of a war with the savage Indians, which broke out on the back settlements of our southern colonies. The Che∣rokees, one of the most numerous and powerful nations of these bar∣barians, had in the beginning, and during the greatest part of the pro∣gress of the war, appeared to be heartily engaged in our interests; at their desire a fort had been built in their country called Fort Loudon, from the then commander in chief of the British forces in America. Some parties of them had appeared in our favour on the last expedition against Fort du Quesne. But it is thought that on that occasion they received some insults, and had been treated in general with a neglect which made the deepest impression on the minds of so vindictive a peo∣ple. These discontents were fo∣mented by the French, who hoped to cause a diversion of a part of our forces in this quarter. At length they commenced hostilities in their usual manner, by cruel ravages and murders on the frontier of their neighbouring provinces. And there was very great reason to apprehend that the same artifices of the enemy, and the same opinion of ill usage, would draw the neighbouring and powerful nation of the Creeks into the like measures.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttleton, who was then go∣vernor of Carolina, having in vain endeavoured to pacify them, took the resolution of march∣ing with all the force, re∣gular <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 1759</NOTE> and provincial, which he could raise, into the Cherokee country. This army in all did not exceed 1100 men, but it was conducted with such spirit and dispatch by Go∣vernor Lyttleton, that in a very short time, he marched 300 miles through the vast desert which lies between the Indian castle of Keeowee and Charles-town. He was advanced into their country before they had made preparations to receive him. They saw their towns in case of ob∣stinacy on the point of being deliver∣ed to fire and sword. They there∣fore desired a conference, in which they acknowledged themselves to blame; and consented to such a trea∣ty of peace as the gover∣nor was pleased to dictate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">26th Dec.</NOTE> They gave up the persons guilty of the most flagrant murders, and put into his hands twenty-two hostages, as a security for their adherence to the treaty.</P>
<P>The governor had all imaginable reason to be satisfied with the effect his expedition had produced; and having as every body believed ef∣fectually chastised the former inso∣lence of the enemy, and secured the future tranquillity of the southern provinces, he returned to Charles-town. But these perfidious bar∣barians, equally regardless of their faith, and of the safety of their countrymen, whose lives were pledg∣ed for their fidelity, broke out as soon as the army was removed, into their former ravages; blocked up Fort Loudon, which stands in the middle of their country, and made some attempts on Fort Edward, which lies nearer to the settlements. Their total want of skill in carry∣ing on sieges prevented them from any hope of mastering these places, otherwise than by treachery or fa∣mine. They failed in the first in∣stance; and the last required time.</P>
<P>The imminent danger of two English garrisons, and that whole tract of our colonies, being made known to General Amherst, he de∣tached Colonel Montgomery to
<PB N="194" REF="211"/>
their assistance, with a regiment of Highlanders, a battalion of the Royal Americans, a body of grenadiers, and the provincial troops. He marched into the ene∣mies country. He made war upon the Indians after their own manner. No other would have been effectual. He burned Estatoe the capital of the Lower Cherokees, consisting of two hundred houses, an Indian town of the very first magnitude; and then proceeded to the same ex∣ecution on all the towns and villages of that district of the Cherokees, which were numerous, populous, and wealthy. The inhabitants ge∣nerally fled on the approach of our troops; some however were burned in their houses, and some women and children were made prison∣ers.</P>
<P>This universal destruction of the lower settlements being compleated, Colonel Montgomery passed on to the middle Cherokees: but as the army march∣ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">27 June.</NOTE> through a dangerous ground, favourable to the Indian method of fighting, they were sudden∣ly attacked upon all sides by this savage enemy, with the greatest fu∣ry, and with the usual horrible screams and outcries. The troops were so well disposed with a view of this kind of war, that they stood the charge with firmness; they were not intimidated with the covered fire, or the screams of the savages. The fight was long and well main∣tained on both sides. But at length the Indians fled. A neighbouring town (one of the most consi∣derable) was entered that night. The enemy made some attempt to molest them; but to little purpose. The English lost in this action 20 killed, and about 80 wounded. The Cherokees had near forty killed. The number of the wounded is not known.</P>
<P>Though Colonel Montgomery was victorious on this occasion; yet it was necessary to retreat on ac∣count of his wounded, for whom he had no place of safety. For if he should attempt to proceed, he had to apprehend frequent skirmishes as he advanced, and the number of wounded together with the dif∣ficulty of his march, would be hour∣ly increased. This retreat was cer∣tainly necessary. But when Colo∣nel Montgomery had arrived at Fort St. George, he discovered part of his orders, which threw the whole country into consternation; which was, that when he had <HI>chas∣tised</HI> the enemy, he was to return to New-York with the troops un∣der his command, and rejoin the grand army. These orders without delay he obeyed; not however with such rigour, but that the earnest en∣treaties of the province prevailed on him to leave about 400 men for their protection.</P>
<P>Carolina and the neighbouring colonies was again exposed to the fury of a savage enemy, not so much weakened as exasperated by their late sufferings; the fate of the garrison of Fort London was but too certain. For several months they had suffered a close block∣ade; at length, seeing no hope of relief their provisions being total∣ly consumed and the ene∣my shewing some pacific dis∣positions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Aug.</NOTE> they were induced to sur∣render upon honourable conditions.</P>
<P>But the enemy, equally regard∣less of faith and humanity, fell upon them in their march, butcher∣ed all the officers but one, killed several of the private soldiers, and carried the rest into an horrible cap∣tivity. These outrages on the south∣ern
<PB N="195" REF="212"/>
colonies threw some damp on the joy which was felt over the English America, on the entire conquest of Canada.</P>
<P>In Europe the fortune of the campaign was nearly ballanced. In America, except this inconsiderable savage war, it was entirely tri∣umphant. In the East-Indies also we gained glory and new advantages. After the raising the siege of Fort St. George, in February 1759, the English army took the field under Major Brere∣ton, <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th April, 1759.</NOTE> and possessed them∣selves of the important town and fort of Conjiveram. About the same time the city of Masulipatam was stormed and taken by Major Ford. By these strokes the French trade on the coast of Coromandel was confined to Pondicherry and a few inconsiderable places. And the traffick of the whole shore for an extent of 800 miles of a populous and manufacturing country, was en∣tirely in the hands of the English company. This coast joins to the rich province of Bengal; out of which also the French were entirely driven by the heroic actions of Co∣lonel Clive.</P>
<P>Encouraged by these successes, a body of about 1200 men, Europeans and Seapoys, under the command of Major Brereton, advanced further, and attempted to dislodge an army of French and their confederate Indians, encamped under the cannon of a fort of that country construction. The acquisition of that place had been a valuable advantage. But here our army was ob∣liged <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> to retire, with a loss of between three and four hundred killed and wounded.</P>
<P>General Lally animated with this and some slighter advantages, threat∣ened the siege of Trichenopoly, and the French affairs seemed again to revive. But it was only a momen∣tary gleam. To check his progress, Colonel Coote at the head of the greatest body he could draw together on that coast, invested Wandewash, took the place in three days, and made the garrison pri∣soners of war. From <NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Nov.</NOTE> thence he passed with rapidity to Ca∣rongoly; the siege of which town he pressed with such diligence, that in four days from the opening his bat∣teries, be obliged the gar∣rison to march out. <NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Dec.</NOTE></P>
<P>This progress alarmed General Lally; he called large detachments in from every side; and knowing the importance of Wandewash, made all his efforts to recover it. He pushed forward the siege with the utmost vigour; hoping to take the town before Colonel Coote could arrive to its relief. But the colonel marched with equal dili∣gence; and arrived about the time when the French <NOTE PLACE="marg">22d July 1760.</NOTE> had made a practicable breach. His army consisted of 1700 Europeans, and about 3000 black troops. Lally's amounted to 2200 Europeans, and between 9 and 10,000 blacks. The engagement was long and obstinate; but at length, the French gave way. It was a total rout; they abandoned their camp, their cannon, and all the im∣plements of the siege. They left a thousand killed and wounded on the field of battle. Among the priso∣ners were Brigadier General Bussy; the Chevalier Godeville, quarter∣master general; Lieutenant Colonel Murphy, and eleven inferior offi∣cers, who were all wounded. Lally fled with his broken troops in despair to Pondicherry.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="213"/>
Of the English in this action near 200 were killed and wounded; in particular the death of the gallant Major Brereton was much regret∣ed. Of the blacks about 70 were wounded and slain.</P>
<P>Except the battle of Paissy, fol∣lowed by the revolution in Bengal, this action was the most considerable in its consequences, of any in which our troops had ever been engaged in India. This was fought in part a∣gainst European troops headed by an able general. The dispositions for the battle, and the conduct of Co∣lonel Coote in the engagement, me∣rit every honour.</P>
<P>This victory was pursued with a spirit equal to that by which it was won. Chittiput was taken in a few days after; and the army al∣lowing itself no repose, marched directly from thence to Arcot, the capital of this immense province. The siege was opened on the fifth of February, and the fort surrendered on the tenth; near 300 Europeans were made prisoners of war.</P>
<P>At sea Admiral Pocock seconded the extraordinary efforts of Colonel Coote with his own usual skill and intrepidity. Again he en∣gaged the fleet of Mon∣sieur d' <NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Sept. 1759.</NOTE> Ache, a brave commander, who has in some de∣gree supported the declining repu∣tation of the French marine; but though superior in the number of his ships, and more than in that proportion superior in guns and men, he was obliged after upwards of two hours severe and bloody con∣flict to give way before Admiral Po∣cock, and to take shelter under the forts of Pondicherry. During this engagement eight of the English ships stood the fire of the whole French fleet, which consisted of six∣teen sail. The ships were great∣ly shattered; five hundred and sixty of our squadron were killed and wounded; and on the side of the French the loss was not less than a thousand. Admiral Pocock imme∣diately got himself again in a fighting condition, and braved the French fleet before Pondicherry, who lay under their cannon, and refused a new engagement.</P>
<P>It has been observed that hi∣story can hardly produce an instance of two squadrons fighting three pitched battles, under the same com∣manders, in eighteen months, with∣out the loss of a ship on either side. After this engagement Admiral Cornish arrived on the coast of Co∣romandel and joined Pocock, by which we attained so decided a su∣periority in strength, as we had be∣fore in courage and ability, that the French no longer appeared in those seas. Most of their ships went off, as it was thought, to Mauritius. Then the French affairs went rapidly to ruin. On the fifth of April the im∣portant fortress of Caracal surrender∣ed to the sea and land forces under Admiral Cornish and Major Monk∣ton. By the taking of this and two other places of lesser consideration, the French were actually reduced to the single port of Pondicherry; which was when these accounts came away, closely blocked up by land and sea. The strongest hopes are conceived that this capital of the French India power and commerce will shortly be brought into our pos∣session; and with these pleasing hopes we conclude the history of the war of 1760.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT WAR.</HEAD>
<HEAD>For the YEAR, 1761.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Preliminary remarks. Treaty proposed and entered into by the belligerent powers. Mr. Stanley sent to Paris, and Mr. Bussy to London. French machinations in Spain. Difficulties in the negotiation. Design of the campaign in Hesse, and of the expedition to Belleisle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER a general war of five years, carried on with the greatest effusion of blood, and the most extraordinary expence ever known to attend a war of that continuance, it was hoped that, if the animosity of the belligerent powers was not abated, at least a great part of the fuel of discord had been consumed; and that the time was arrived for giving peace to Europe. Some propositions for that purpose had been made in the close of the year 1759. Those, who rather wished for peace, than very attentively considered the proba∣bility of effecting it, seemed to think it might then have been expected. But whilst the public was flattered with these hopes, the situation of affairs would not suffer us to believe that they had any solid foundation. We accordingly ventured to point out the difficulties which then ob∣structed any scheme for peace And as these difficulties were such, as did not attend that particular conjuncture only, but must subsist
<PB N="198" REF="215"/>
as long as the fortune of war con∣tinued in the same train, we were from the beginning apprehensive that the new negotiation which we have since seen opened, and for some time carried on with such pleasing appearances, might in the issue be attended with no better success.</P>
<P>There are indeed but two situa∣tions in which peace can be very rationally expected. The first situa∣tion is that of <HI>equality;</HI> and this is, either where nothing is gained on any side; so that when ever mutual weariness, and unprofitable hosti∣lities have calmed the ardor of the warring powers, no intricate points intervene to frustrate the first pa∣cific disposition; or it may be where the losses are so equal, that ex∣changes may easily be made, or the parties may rest mutually satisfied with their advantage over each other.</P>
<P>The second situation is that of <HI>necessity;</HI> where one of the parties is so entirely broken and reduced, as to submit to receive conditions on the footing of conquest, and to pur∣chase repose by humiliating and en∣feebling concessions. A peace up∣on this latter basis is always the grand popular object. In every war we flatter ourselves with the hope of it, against an experience almost uniform. In fact, it is to the last degree difficult to reduce any of the great powers of Europe to this disgraceful necessity. For to reduce any one of them to this state of sub∣mission, you must, in a manner, re∣duce all of them to it. The war, if it continues, draws state after state into its vortex, until all Europe is involved. A sort of ballance is then produced, and the peace of conquest becomes impracticable.</P>
<P>It would prove of the utmost mo∣ment to the tranquility of mankind that this point were sufficiently re∣garded, and that they would wil∣lingly adopt that system of equality, to which sooner or later, with more or fewer struggles, they are so often compelled to submit. When, sel∣dom, a treaty is concluded on other terms, as the King of Prussia has found by severe experience, and as we observed on a former occasion, is only a short cessation, and not a perfect peace. But it must be ac∣knowledged that this situation, the most coincident with their true in∣terest, is at the same time the most contradictory to the passions and prejudices of nations. It appears hard to lose upon every side every object of the war. A peace on this foundation will be censured, but it is the best, on the same principle that the shortest follies are the best; and that no injured pride is left to brood over a future war. Contrary to the opinion of the warm patriots on all sides, we therefore imagined that the year seventeen hundred and fifty-eight, in the close of the third campaign, was the happy moment for negotiation. At this time, however, no propositions had been made. The propositions of seventeen hundred and fifty-nine were but slightly regarded, and ob∣viously could end in nothing. But in the beginning of the year, of which we are now going to treat, the scene of negotiation was open∣ed with far greater solemnity and parade; and as it was carried on with great diligence, it necessarily makes a principal part of the history of this year. It is indeed some∣what fortunate both for the writers and the readers of these events that this treaty has intervened. The
<PB N="199" REF="216"/>
narrative otherwise had proved ex∣tremely barren and unentertaining, For though the animosity of the bel∣ligerent powers was not, as we observed, abated, their efforts, how∣ever, had considerably slackened, and their operations began gradu∣ally to degenerate into the Petite∣guerre. Those vast events that astonish the mind, or hold it in a pleasing suspence; those important battles and sieges; those rapid and well-conducted marches, and those lively enterprizes which distinguish the former years, except in a very few instances, scarce make any part of the history before us. But tho' the operations of the field had fallen into a state of languor, the cabinet became full of business, and nego∣tiation flourished. In this situa∣tion candour obliges us to acquaint our readers that we are still more liable to mistakes, than when we attempt to describe the transactions of the campaign. It very frequent∣ly happens, that the accounts of the military operations come authenti∣cated from the hands of those great generals who have conducted them, and when we have allowed for the partiality of the account, there is nothing to be detracted from them for want of sufficient information. Even in the case of partiality, we are often able to correct the misre∣presentation or over-charge of one of the parties by that of the other. These things are done in the eye of the world. But the motives either to peace or war, and the steps taken in a negotiation, are all behind the curtain. They do not appear for a long time, and sometimes they never appear completely. There is however, an advantage in the pre∣sent conjuncture. For one of the powers at war, in order to justify to its subjects and to the world, its part in the continuance of a war so fatal to both, has published an ac∣count of the late negotiation; art∣ful indeed, and probably in some respects unfair; but containing at the same time many valuable and illustrating pieces, the authenticity of which is not disputed. The point in such cases to be dreaded is not the publication of false pieces, but the concealment of several that are real and important. The public information is probably rather in∣compleat, than untrue. We wait with impatience for that full and authentic narrative of so important a negotiation, which undoubtedly our court proposes to publish. We have delayed the setting out our work the longer, in hopes of its appearance, by which we might have been able to perfect and cor∣rect our account of this transaction. The account of the Spanish nego∣tiation has appeared late, but we have not failed to make use of it. At present we engage in our work, under those difficulties, which it is just the reader should know and al∣low for. In the succeeding year we shall take care to profit of whatever further lights may be imparted.</P>
<P>Very early in this year 1761, the courts of Petersburgh, Vienna, France, Sweden and Poland, agreed severally and jointly to offer pro∣posals towards renewing that nego∣tiation for peace, which had abrupt∣ly been broken off in the close of the year 1759. France was the principal and first mover; for as it was her ambition which had made the war so general, and her revenue which in a great measure supported it; the former being now humbled by a series of unfortunate events, and the latter reduced by most enor∣mous
<PB N="200" REF="217"/>
expences, she began at length to relent, and apparently to desire peace in earnest. The other mem∣bers of the grand alliance could not decently, nor safely oppose these dispositions of France. The court of Sweden in particular was given to understand, that the ex∣hausted condition of France was the true motive of her moderation; that in fact, she was not able any longer to furnish the stipulated subsidies, nor to adhere to the letter of her engagements with her allies. These circumstances, which she was neither able, nor seemed disposed to con∣ceal, formed the surest guaranty of her sincerity.</P>
<P>The five parties to the war on that side, made as many declara∣tions, which were signed at Paris on the 25th of March, and deliver∣ed at London on the 31st of the same month. The counter decla∣ration of Great Britain and Prussia appeared on the 3d of April. Augs∣burg, as the situation most commo∣dious for the powers at war, was appointed for the congress.</P>
<P>Lord Egremont, Lord Stormont ambassador in Poland, and general Yorke our ambassador in Holland, were nominated as the English plenipotentiaries. On the part of France, the count de Choiseul was appointed. Augsburg now became the centre of attention to all Europe, and each court prepared every thing towards this important meeting which it could furnish of splendor for the display of its dignity, and of ability for the support of its interest. The public conversation was for a while diverted from scenes of horror, bloodshed, and pillage; and every mind was employed more agreeably on the public scene of magnificence, and the private game of policy, which was to ensue.</P>
<P>In the first place, it was unani∣mously agreed, in order that a ne∣gotiation, in itself sufficiently intri∣cate, should be the less embarrassed, to admit to the treaty none but the parties principally concerned, to∣gether with their allies.</P>
<P>Although this exclusion of the neutral interests tended greatly to disembarrass and simplify the nego∣tiation, yet such was the variety of separate and independent matters, which still remained to be discussed, that it became adviseable to make a further separation, if they hoped to treat upon them with any tole∣rable ease, or with any prospect of coming to a speedy decision.</P>
<P>For this purpose it was necessary to bring back the motives to the war to their first principles; and to disengage those several interests which originally, and in their own nature had no connection, from that mass, in which mutual injuries and a common animosity had blended and confounded them. This pro∣position came first from France, and it was an early and happy omen of her inclination to peace.</P>
<P>The war, which was truly and originally German, evidently had but a single, though this a very dif∣ficult object, to determine the fate of the king of Prussia. So many powers were concerned in this de∣termination, and their views of ag∣grandisement, indemnification, and revenge, so various and difficult to be reconciled, that this alone seem∣ed matter enough for a separate and very arduous negotiation. In effect all the powers of the north were concerned in it. For this rea∣son, the other great object of the
<PB N="201" REF="218"/>
general war, the limits of America, which by that strange chain of hostile connections, which even unites the various independent quarrels and enmities of Europe, had been mixed with the German disputes, was again set upon its proper and peculiar basis; and whilst the truly German interests were handled at Augsburg, it was proposed to treat on this head sepa∣rately in London and in Paris. For this purpose, ministers were mu∣tually sent from those courts; Mr. Stanley on the part of England; and Mr. Bussy on that of France.</P>
<P>This proposition was also exceed∣ingly prudent; for there is no doubt that if these potentates could settle their claims to their mutual satis∣faction; and should carry to Augs∣burg the same candour and good faith, and the same sincere desire of peace, their influence must neces∣sarily tend to inspire principles of moderation into the rest, and must contribute largely to accelerate the great work of pacification.</P>
<P>Things were thus set upon the best footing possible, and the nego∣tiation seemed to be in the happiest train that could be wished. But unfortunately the plan and dispo∣sition of the treaty was much more easily adjusted, than the matter and the substance. It was very obvious, that France, if she was willing even to pretend to a desire of peace, could scarce avoid making conces∣sions, which to her were sufficiently mortifying. The moment her pro∣per quarrel came to be separated from the general cause, she had every disadvantage in the negotia∣tion, because she had suffered every disaster in the war. On the side of Germany indeed she had acted with success; but even there the advan∣tages she had acquired were still precarious, as the chance of war was still open: no proposition for a cessation of arms having been ad∣mitted. As she knew therefore, that great sacrifices might be expect∣ed from her, she did not so finally rest her hopes upon the negotiation, as not to look out for another re∣source; and this rendered on her part the whole proceeding less effec∣tive and less sincere.</P>
<P>The resource she sought was in Spain, who she hoped could not look with indifference on the humi∣liation of the principal branch of the house of Bourbon. Hitherto indeed the king of Spain had ob∣served a tolerably exact Neutrality in his conduct, and in his decla∣rations had spared no expressions of good will and friendship to our court. He seemed to be wholly intent on the internal oeconomy of his dominions, on the improvement of their long neglected police, on the advancement of their commerce, and the regulation of the finances. But notwithstanding these domestic attentions, the French ministry did not despair of drawing his regards abroad. They thought that the offers which France in her present circumstances would find herself obliged to make, must extremely alarm all good Spaniards, who could not see without the most serious apprehensions, the French power wholly annihilated in America. By this event, their colonies, though so much superior to all others in opulence and extent, must in a manner lie at the mercy of Eng∣land: no power being in any sort able to afford them assistance, or to hold the ballance between them and the power of England. At this time indeed, the French court had not absolutely succeeded in her de∣signs
<PB N="202" REF="219"/>
at Madrid: but she was in hopes, that every step she took in the treaty, and every concession she should make, would prove a fresh incentive to the jealousies and ap∣prehensions of Spain. Thus in effect all the motions which France seemingly made towards peace were in reality so many steps towards a new war; and whilst at London she breathed nothing but modera∣tion, and the most earnest desire of putting a period to the calamities of Europe, at Madrid she was taking the most vigorous measures for spreading them further, and continuing them longer.</P>
<P>On the side of England, though there was far more good faith in the public procedure, there were also, it must be admitted, many circumstances which co-operated to retard the peace. The great and almost unparallelled success which attended our arms in this war, had raised a proportionable expectation, and inspired very high thoughts in∣to the minds of the people. They thought it unreasonable to make almost any concessions to a nation whose ambition and violence they had always found to correspond with its power, and whom they now considered as lying at their mercy. That this was the time for reducing France, which if we let pass, we could never hope again to recover. In these sentiments it must have fared ill with that admi∣nistration, who should make a sacri∣fice of any of those objects on which the people had set their hearts.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it could not have escaped them, that the situa∣tion of affairs in Germany, how∣ever they might be artificially se∣parated in the discussion, must ne∣cessarily have an influence on the final determination of the treaty. They saw, that after a severe strug∣gle of five years, the affairs of our nearest allies were only not ruined. To say nothing of the condition of the king of Prussia, the whole country of Hesse was in the actual possession of France; they likewise held the county of Hanau; and by their occupation of Gottingen, the Hanoverian territory lay open to their arms. If this quarrel should be considered as a cause not strictly English (though the French in their memorials contended it was), yet certainly the Hessians, and princi∣pally the Hanoverians, were allies of so near a connection, and had done and suffered so much in the common cause, that it must have appeared shocking to all Europe, if solely attentive to our own pecu∣liar advantages, we should patch up a peace without any provision in their favour: and it was very evi∣dent, that this provision could not be made in the situation in which the last campaign had left them, unless our government purchased it at a price that would be very grudg∣ingly paid by the English subjects.</P>
<P>The ministry, perplexed between the natural expectations of their country, and the reasonable ex∣pectations of their allies, must have found it not a little difficult to know what party they ought to take. In order to reconcile, as much as possible, these contradic∣tory desires, the only solution which could be found was to push the war with the utmost vigour; and in the mean time not to hurry the nego∣tiation; in hopes that during its progress things might take such a turn, as to enable them to purchase peace for their allies out of the ac∣quisitions they should have made
<PB N="203" REF="220"/>
after the commencement of the treaty, and without being obliged to have recourse to their conquests, previous to that aera. On this footing they proposed to satisfy the de∣mands of the public faith, and at the same time to preserve the repu∣tation which was so necessary to their affairs at home. Accordingly the duke of Brunswick was to pro∣secute with the utmost vigour, the operations which he had begun in the depth of winter; and an ex∣pedition, the object of which was then secret, was prepared with equal diligence in England.</P>
<P>In these equivocal dispositions, and in this odd mixture of hostile and pacificmeasures, began the year 1761, a year more remarkable, perhaps, than any of those we have hitherto described, for events which will be radically decisive of the future pros∣perity or misery of Europe, but less for those matters by which the ima∣gination of the reader is commonly affected. Having in this chapter laid down, as far as we can con∣jecture, the political motives for the uncommon effort which was made in Germany, in our next chapter we shall give an account of the mi∣litary plan of this effort, the exe∣cution and the success of it.</P>

Allies retire behind the Dymel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT the close of the last cam∣paign, the French had the entire and undisturbed possession of the whole territory of Hesse: a country tolerably provided, and which contains many tenable places. Some of these they had strengthen∣ed with additional works; and they had amassed immense magazines in the most convenient situations. This was their condition in the front of their winter cantonments. On their left they had driven the allies from the Lower Rhine, where they kept a considerable body of troops, which streightened our quarters, and checked our efforts on that side. On their right they possessed the town of Gottingen, in which they had placed a very strong gar∣rison; and thus they shut us up on this quarter also, whilst the king's German dominions lay entirely open to their enterprizes.</P>
<P>If we consider the situation of the French armies, they will pre∣sent us with the idea of an immense crescent, the two advanced points of which were at Gottingen and Wesel and the body extended in Hesse: so that being perfectly well provided with magazines, and master of all the proper communications neces∣sary for their current subsistence, with strong places in their rear, and in both their flanks; in the next campaign they had only to advance their several posts in a manner to enclose the allied army, which, without some signal success (from their numbers and situation, hardly to be expected) would find it∣self
<PB N="204" REF="221"/>
entirely incapable of making any stand against them.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand was very sen∣sible of these inconveniencies of his situation, and of the advantages the enemy had over him. It was ex∣tremely difficult to settle a plan for action; but no action could be at∣tended with much worse conse∣quences, than inactivity in a bad condition. He knew from expe∣rience, that the French were ill qualified for winter operations in Germany, and that his own soldiers, besides their superior hardiness, and their being inured to the rigour of the climate, could suffer but little more from field service, especially if attended with success, than they must endure from the badness of their winter quarters. It is true that there was something discourag∣ing in the attack of a very superior body of the enemy, possessed of every advantage against him: but it was clear, that this superiority, and these advantages would not lessen as the summer approached. It was clear, that every step the enemy gained on him, would render his defence weaker and his resources more scanty; and that if the enemy found themselves in a condition to commence this campaign where they had concluded the last, and that no∣thing should hinder their proceeding in the earliest season, he could never reasonably hope to protract the war to another year. For to speak the truth, this was the utmost, which in his circumstances he could pro∣mise himself from the most judi∣cious scheme of conduct.</P>
<P>Having therefore resolved to act, he lost no time to act with vigour. He appointed three places of ren∣dezvous on the Dymel, the Rhine, and in Saverland. His army as∣sembled on the 9th of February, without suffering the enemy to have any previous notice of their inten∣tions. The next day the troops halted, and the duke communicat∣ed to his generals the disposition he had made for the motions of the whole.</P>
<P>The centre was led by his serene highness in person; it penetrated directly into Hesse, and marching by Zierenberg and Durenberg, made its way towards Cassel. The right and left of the army were each at a very considerable distance from this body; but they were so disposed as fully to co-operate in the general plan of operation, which was very extensive. The heredi∣tary prince commanded on the right: he marched by Stadbergen for Mengeringhausen; and leaving the country of Hesse to the East∣ward, as the alarm was to be as sudden, and as widely diffused as possible, he pushed forward with the utmost expedition into the heart of the French quarters. Gen. Sporcken commanded a corps at a greater distance to the left, and penetrated into Thuringia, by Du∣derstadt and Heiligenstadt. The design of this movement was to break the communication of the French with the army of the empire, to open one for ourselves with the Prussians, and to cut off all inter∣course between the grand army of the enemy, and their garrison at Gottingen.</P>
<P>By this sudden, extensive, and vigorous attack, the French were thrown into the utmost consterna∣tion: they retreated, or rather fled upon ever side. It could scarcely have been imagined, that this was the same army which had but just closed the campaign with so much
<PB N="205" REF="222"/>
success. Such has been the sport of fortune in this war, even beyond all former examples of her caprice, that the instances are numerous of inferior and beaten armies, without any apparent change in their cir∣cumstances, driving the conquerors before them. So remarkable was the revolution of fortune at this time, that it is highly credible if the French had had their quarters in an open country, their army had been totally destroyed: but happily for them, they had very sufficient means of securing their retreat. For as the allies advanced, they were obliged to leave Cassel and Gottin∣gen at their backs; into the former of which the enemy had thrown a garrison equal to a moderate army; and in the latter they had seven or eight thousand men. Beyond these again were Fritzlar, Ziegenhayn, and Marpurg, places of a tolerable degree of strength and well gar∣risoned, besides some other inferior posts.</P>
<P>The hereditary prince, whose party was the most advanced, struck the first blow, by an attempt to sur∣prize Fritzlar. He had received advice that it was not prepared to receive him. He accordingly took only a few battalions and no can∣non, in hopes of being able to carry that place at once. But un∣fortunately he was deceived in his intelligence. The garrison was prepared and resolute, and though the hereditary prince attacked it with his usual spirit, he was obliged for that time to desist, and to draw off with no inconsiderable loss.</P>
<P>About this time, Marpurg was attempted in the same manner, and with no better success. General Breidenback, an Hanoverian of∣ficer, of great bravery; experience and reputation, who commanded there, lost his life in the attack. These two severe checks at the entrance into action, did not, however, discourage either the parties that suffered them, or the rest of the army. They advanced as expeditiously, and with more caution. Cannon and mortar were brought before Fritzlar, which, after a defence that was rather made for the credit of the com∣mander, than from any hope of saving the place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Feb.</NOTE> surrendered on honourable terms. A large magazine was found here. The marquis of Granby was employ∣ed, with success in reducing the forts and castles in this neighbourhood. The allied army resolutely advanc∣ed, and as they advanced, the French continually retired, aban∣doning post after post, and fell back almost to the Maine. They fired their magazines as they retreated; but the allies pursued with so much rapidity, that they saved five capi∣tal stores; one of which contained no less than eighty thousand sacks of meal, fifty thousand sacks of oats, and a million of rations of hay, a very small part of which had been destroyed. These were ac∣quisitions of the utmost advantage, as they wonderfully facilitated the progress of the army; which as it advanced, still found its subsistence; provision was also thereby made for the cavalry, which otherwise, it could never have been supplied with in such a season, and at such a vast distance from our original quarters.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this success in front, it was not here the grand object of our operations lay. Cassel was to be reduced. The French had in that town a garrison of
<PB N="206" REF="223"/>
seventeen battalions, besides some other corps, under the command of the count de Broglio; and there was no doubt, that he would de∣fend the place to the utmost. The fortifications of Cassel are mostly in the old manner; they consist of very high, but strong walls. Some works indeed had been newly add∣ed; but the great hope of the ene∣my was in the strength of the gar∣rison and the rigour of the season. The siege of this place was not to be delayed; however it was neces∣sary prevously to clear all the ad∣jacent country of the enemy, and to cut off the communication of the garrison with their grand army.</P>
<P>Therefore when marshal Broglio had been driven quite out of Hesse, and had retreated towards Frank∣fort, prince Ferdinand ceased to advance; and having ordered two bodies to the blockade of Marpurg and Ziegenhayn, which still obsti∣nately held out, he formed that part of the army which was with him into a chain of cantonments, making a front towards the enemy which extended from the river Lahn to the river Ohm, and from the Ohm to the Fulda; thus he proposed to watch the motions of Marshal Broglio's army, to cover the siege of Cassel, and the blockades of the two fortresses just mentioned. The siege of Cassel was carried on by the count of Lippe Schaumburg, a sovereign prince of the empire, re∣puted one of the ablest engineers in Europe: His management of the artillery at Thornhausen was a prin∣cipal cause in the acquisition of that great victory; and it was not doubt∣ed that his abilities would be ex∣erted as effectively at Cassel. Tren∣ches were opened on the first of March. All eyes were now directed to this point; for on the success of this stroke depended the whole for∣tune of the campaign. It was very apparent that if Cassel and its garrison should fall into the hands of the allies, Gottingen and the inferior places must inevitably fall along with it; and this misfortune would be more than equivalent to the loss of a great battle.</P>
<P>Whilst the war was thus carried on in Hesse, M. Sporken who com∣manded the detachment to the left, on the side of Saxony, advanced with an intrepidity equal to the rest; he was soon joined by a corps of Prussians, and the united army lost no time to clear the Werra and the Unstrut of the bodies of French and Saxons which ocupied the most important posts upon these ri∣vers. As these bodies were ad∣vantageously posted, and could be supported on one side by the gar∣rison of Gottingen, and on the other, as they promised themselves, by the army of the empire, they maintained their ground; and this soon brought on a sharp action. The allies attacked a large body advantage∣ously <NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Feb.</NOTE> posted at Langensaltze upon the Unstrut; the event was en∣tirely favourable. Three whole bat∣talions of Saxons were made pri∣soners by the Prussians; M. de Sporcken took two battalions. The enemy's loss was computed at five thousand men; several pieces of cannon were also taken, and a large magazine was abandoned. This blow was well followed; one body of the combined army pushed to Eise∣nach and Gotha, whilst another by forced marches got forward to Ful∣da; the French gave way on their right, and the army of the empire on the left; the latter fell back to
<PB N="207" REF="224"/>
Bamberg, totally abandoning a very large tract of country.</P>
<P>Hitherto the affairs of the allies proceeded almost in an uninter∣rupted course of prosperity. It was indeed a degree of prosperity altogether astonishing, and which as at first it could scarcely have been expected, so there was no reason to imagine it would have any long continuance. For the al∣lies on the side of Saxony, where M. Sporcken acted, in proportion as their activity and success carried them forward, left the countries on their rear more and more un∣covered, and exposed, without any or with a very insufficient defence, to the attempts of the powerful garrison of Gottingen. The count de Vaux, who commanded that garrison, is a very able and enter∣prising officer. And he no sooner perceived, that the allies were wholly intent upon driving their enemies from the Werra and Un∣strut, and on pushing the advan∣tages they had acquired to the ut∣most, than he marched out of Got∣tingen with a strong detachment, attacked and routed an Hanoverian convoy, fell upon the town of Du∣derstadt with the utmost violence; and though he failed in his first at∣tempt, he repeated it with so much spirit, that at length he carried that town, and afterwards some of the most considerable places near it. By these successes he prevented M. de Sporcken's corps from return∣ing by the way they had advanced, and indeed absolutely disqualified them from acting seperately from their main army; to which soon after these events, they were o∣bliged to join themselves. This junction now became necessary on another account.</P>
<P>Marshal Broglio towards the close of the last campaign had been obliged, by the enterprises of the hereditary prince, to detach from his army in Hesse a large body to the Lower Rhine. He now found it equally proper to recall this body together with further reinforce∣ments, in order to maintain his ground in the country northward of the Maine, where he was close∣ly pressed by the allies, and which he must be compelled shamefully to relinquish, if Cassel was not relieved in time. Sensible of this, with whatever difficulty, he called in his most distant posts, embodied his army, inspired them with new spirits, and made them capable, by a more exact order in their disci∣pline and a great superiority in their numbers, of attempting something considerable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the hopes of the allies depended on the effect of their first impression; they were obliged to attempt too many ob∣jects at the same time, and these too arduous for the number of which their army consisted. For it was necessary that they should keep one army, and that no small one, employed on the siege of Cassel; a∣nother was occupied in the blockade of Ziegenhayn; a third was em∣ployed to the eastward of the Ful∣da; and still a fourth was necessary to cover and sustain all these vari∣ous operations, and to oppose itself to the attempts of marshal Broglio. It was but too plain, that when the whole of the French force was col∣lected in one point, it could never be resisted by a part only of the al∣lied army; if they should attempt to draw away any of the separate corps from the critical service upon which it was employed, the entire
<PB N="208" REF="225"/>
purpose of their labours was given up. In a word, prince Ferdinand had three strong posts of the enemy on his rear, and their grand army now perfectly united on his front, and his situation, which was far from advantageous, obliged him to call in M. Sporcken's body which had effected its purpose and could best be spared. However the prince kept his position as long as possible; and the siege was carried on with as much vigour as a winter operation, and the spirited defence of a great garrison ably commanded, would admit.</P>
<P>But marshal Broglio, as soon as he had collected his army, advanc∣ed without delay. He caused the troops under the hereditary prince to be attacked near the village of Stangerode, in the neighbourhood of Grunberg, where he was advanc∣ed in front of the before-mentioned line of the allied army. The at∣tack was made by the enemies dragoons, the very first shock of which broke the whole foot, con∣sisting of nine regiments, Hanove∣rians, Hessians, and Brunswickers. The French on this occasion made two thousand prisoners, and pos∣sessed themselves of several trophies of victory; few were killed or wounded on either side.</P>
<P>After this blow the allied army could no longer think of making head against the French, or of maintaining their ground in Hesse. They broke up the blockade of Zie∣genhayn; and soon after raised the siege of Cassel, after twenty-seven days open trenches. They evacuat∣ed the whole country of Hesse, re∣tiring behind the Dymel, and fall∣ing back nearly to the quarters they possessed before this undertaking.</P>
<P>Thus ended an expedition which was carried on against many diffi∣culties, with much spirit, and which at first excited great hopes. It failed indeed in some of its objects; but it produced its effect in the to∣tal of the operations of the year. The French, by the destruction or seizure of so many of their princi∣pal magazines, were for a long time disabled from taking any advantage of their successes in the preceding campaign, or from their late victo∣ry. It was not until the season was a good deal advanced that they were in a condition to act. This cessation was not dearly bought even by the loss we sustained at Stangerode, and the extreme hard∣ships the troops had endured dur∣ing the whole service; for circum∣stanced as both armies were at their quitting the field, without this sea∣sonable check it is probable we should have at this day no footing in Germany. Both armies as it were by consent lay quiet in their winter quarters. During their in∣action, the negotiation at London and Paris, whose commencement we have related in the first chapter, was pursued without interruption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The negotiation continued. Proposition of</HI> uti possidetis. <HI>Debate con∣cerning the periods. Belleisle described. English repulsed at Lochma∣ria bay. They make good their landing. Palais besieged. Town a∣bandoned. Citadel capitulates.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT must be observed, that after the judicious separations which had been made of the interests of the several powers at war, there still remained a sufficient fund of in∣tricacy and altercation in each par∣ticular discussion. In order there∣fore to make the way to peace as smooth as possible, it was resolved previously to establish some certain and simple points that might serve to direct and keep steady the whole negotiation. These points were but two; indeed they were so insepa∣rably connected with each other, that they seem rather members of the same proposition than separate articles. The first was, <HI>that the two crowns shall remain in possessi∣on of what they have conquered one from the other.</HI> The second im∣ported that, <HI>the situation in which they shall stand at certain periods, shall be the position to serve as a basis for the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</HI></P>
<P>As France was known to have had the worst in the war, a propo∣sition of <HI>statu quo,</HI> coming from her, must have appeared an instance of moderation, altogether surprizing to our ministers. It is certain, that had peace been concluded at that instant, and upon the sole founda∣tion of this article, England would then have possessed all the conquests she had made, every one of which was in a very high degree advan∣tageous to her commerce and her power, and none of which could be considered as a subject of future discussion. On the other hand, France continuing in possession of the places she had conquered, would have acquired no advantage that could at all countervail the expence of keeping them; at the same time that she would be exposed to end∣less altercations, and would afford matter of the highest jealousy, in∣dignation, and discontent, even to her nearest allies. This basis being therefore settled, although it was evident, that the treaty could not rest upon this basis solely, England had certainly a great superiority in the negotiation, and might rational∣ly expect (when they should come to talk of restitutions) to purchase the evacuation of the French conquests in Germany, at a much smaller price than their apparent magnitude might seem to demand. However these were still a matter of so much anxiety, and the nature of the pre∣cise stipulations were still so uncer∣tain, that the negotiation, though it proceeded with strong appearance of a desire for peace, met with very frequent checks and delays. Both parties were indeed unanimous in the article of <HI>uti possidetis;</HI> than which, it must be admitted, there could not be a better ground to treat upon. But as the war still continued, and whilst it continued might make a daily alteration in the fortune of the contracting pow∣ers, it was necessary to fix upon some epochas to which this posses∣sory article should refer.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="227"/>
The French on this head pro∣posed, <HI>that the situation in which they shall stand on the</HI> first of Sep∣tember in the year 1761 <HI>in the East Indies,</HI> on the first of July in the same year <HI>in the West Indies and in Africa, and on</HI> the first of May following <HI>in Europe, should be the position, which should serve as a basis to the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</HI> They added further, that as these epochas might seem too near or too distant for the interest of Great Britain, they were extremely wil∣ling to enter into a negotiation up∣on that object.</P>
<P>The English ministry received this proposition with less satisfac∣tion than its apparent fairness de∣served. They entirely rejected the French epochas; and declared that they could not admit, without pre∣judice to themselves, any other e∣pochas than those which <HI>have re∣ference to the day of signing the treaty of peace.</HI> Had this resolu∣tion been strictly adhered to, it was evident that the negotiation was that moment at an end. For though what was asserted in the French me∣morial in reply to this declaration, <HI>(that the basis of the proposition of</HI> uti possidetis <HI>was necessarily connect∣ed with the particular epochas pro∣posed)</HI> is by no means to be admit∣ted; it is on the other hand not ea∣sy to deny the validity of their sub¦sequent assertion, "that if not these, at least <HI>some</HI> certain periods during the war ought to be fixed; and that the <HI>uti possidetis</HI> could not rea∣sonably have reference only to the time of signing the treaty of peace." For if the contrary principle were once admitted, it would become difficult to know, or even with pro∣bability to guess, at the nature or the value of the possessions which by such an article should be mutu∣ally given away. And if these difficulties occurred in the simpli∣city of a possessory article, they must be increased tenfold upon every other, and must come to such an height as to preclude all possibility of negotiation on things of so intricate a nature as exchan∣ges and equivalents. The French in their memorial insisted so strong∣ly on the propriety of establishing these periods, that they threatened to recal the whole proposition if they were not agreed to.</P>
<P>It must doubtless appear at first view surprizing, to see France, whose actual situation was very in∣different, contending for a near period, and England, whose affairs were at that time apparently in a prosperous situation, postponing the <HI>uti possidetis</HI> to one more re∣mote. But the truth is, that in that particular neither party con∣sulted their present condition. They acted wholly on foresight. For though the English, on the 25th of March, when this proposition was made, were carrying on the siege of Cassel, and the other strong places in Hesse, and the enemy had no army in that country to oppose them, it was notwithstanding evi∣dent that from the slow progress of those sieges, and from the ala∣crity of marshal Broglio in collect∣ing his troops, they must be shortly obliged to abandon the enterprize; it was evident that France must be reinstated in the absolute possession of her former conquests long be∣fore the epocha of the first of May, the period which they fixed for Europe. Both courts were fully apprized of this. It was therefore
<PB N="211" REF="228"/>
the interest of France to offer and of England to reject this near period; especially as the fate of the design on the coast of France was then depending, and our ad∣ministration seemed to have con∣ceived no mean hopes of its suc∣cess, and no small opinion of its importance in the negotiation.</P>
<P>The fleet employed in this ex∣pedition sailed from Spithead on the 29th of March, and it was soon discovered that Belleisle was the object.</P>
<P>Belleisle, the largest of all the European islands belonging to the French king, is between 12 and 13 leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>The island originally belonged to the earl of Cornouaille, but has been since yielded to the king: it contains only one little city, cal∣led Le Palais, three country towns, 103 villages, and about 5000 in∣habitants.</P>
<P>The town of Palais takes its name from a castle, belonging to the duke de Belleisle, in its neighbour∣hood, which is now converted into a citadel, which is a regular and strong fortification, fronting the sea, composed principally of horn∣work, and is provided with two dry ditches, the one next the counterscarp, and the other so contrived as to secure the interior fortifications. This citadel is di∣vided from the largest part of the town by an inlet of the sea, over which there is a bridge of com∣munication; from the other part of the town, and which is most inhabited, it is only divided by its own fortifications, and a glacis. There are three nominal har∣bours in this island, Palais, Sauzon and Goulfard; every one of which labours under some capital defect, either in being exposed, shallow, or dangerous at the entrance. The only branch of trade car∣ried on here is the curing pil∣chards.</P>
<P>From this state of the island, poor in itself, capable of little im∣provement, and so ill circum∣stanced in point of harbours, a sort of a dislike to the expedition began to arise. Several did not see of what considerable service such a conquest could be of to England in time of peace, or of what pre∣judice to the enemy in time of war. They foresaw that it could not be taken without considerable loss, or kept without considerable expence; and on the whole they apprehended that when exchanges came to be made, France would lay no great stress upon it. On the other hand it was urged, that though the harbours were bad, yet small privateers might issue from thence, greatly to the mo∣lestation of the French coasting trade; and that the fleet of England might ride between it and the con∣tinent in a well protected road. They imagined the possession of this island, if not of great detri∣ment to the interest of France, would be a grievous wound to her pride; and that those circum∣stances which had formerly indu∣ced her to expend money on the fortifications there, and on the ap∣prehension of an invasion to fill them with a powerful garrison, would likewise persuade her to set a value on the place when it came to be estimated in the treaty.</P>
<P>Whilst they reasoned in this man∣ner in England, the fleet under the command of commodore Keppel, and the land forces under gene∣ral Hodgson, arrived before Belleisle
<PB N="212" REF="229"/>
on the 7th of April, and on the 8th agreed to attempt a landing on the south-east of the island in a sandy bay near Lochmaria point. Here the enemy were in possession of a little fort; they had more∣over entrenched themselves on an hill excessively steep, and the foot of which was scarped away. The attempt was made in three places with great resolution; a few grenadiers got on shore, and form∣ed themselves; but as they were not supported, they were for the greater part made prisoners. The rest of the army, after several very brave and repeated efforts, being wholly unable to force the enemies lines, or make good their land∣ing, were obliged to retire with loss; what added to the disaster was, that several of the flat bot∣tomed vessels were destroyed or damaged in an hard gale which followed on our retiring from the shore. This made the prospect of any future attempt more unplea∣sing even than the first. In this attack we lost in killed, wounded and prisoners, near five hundred men.</P>
<P>Neither commanders nor sol∣diers were however dispirited by this mortifying repulse. They re∣solved, if possible, not to return without effect, and then determin∣ed diligently to search the whole coast, in order to find a place more favourable for another at∣tack. The view indeed was not encouraging. The island is na∣turally a fortification; and what nature had left undone to make it such, had been amply supplied by art.</P>
<P>It was a long time after this first failure before the weather would give our commanders an opportunity of a second trial; however they persisted with the utmost steadiness, and found at length a convenient situation. Not that it was a part of the coast less strong than the rest; on the con∣trary, they built their principal hopes on the excessive steepness and difficulty of the rocks, which had rendered the enemy rather less at∣tentive on this quarter. This ar∣duous attempt was made at a bold rocky shore, near the above-men∣tioned point of Lochmaria. Be∣sides the principal attack, two feints were made at the same time to di∣stract the enemy, whilst the men of war directed their fire with great judgment and effect on the hills. These manoeuvres gave bri∣gadier general Lambert with an handful of men, an opportunity of climbing up a very steep rock, without molestation. This little body having thus prosperously gained the top of the hill, form∣ed themselves in good order, and without de∣lay. <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> They were immediately at∣tacked by three hundred of the French, but they maintained their advantage with resolution until the whole corps of brigadier Lam∣bert, which now had ascended in the same manner, arrived to their assistance, and repulsed the enemy.</P>
<P>The landing of all the forces was made good in a short time af∣ter. The loss in this daring and successful attempt, was inconsi∣derable. In one or two places the enemy seemed disposed to make some stand; but the body of light horse, which was embarked in this expedition, soon drove them to the town, and laid all quite open to the intrenchments before it. The great
<PB N="213" REF="230"/>
difficulty now consisted in bringing forward the cannon, which were first to be dragged up the rocks, and afterwards, for two leagues, along a very rugged and broken road. This necessarily took up some time. However the siege was commenced with vigour: and the garrison, commanded by the chevalier de St. Croix, a brave and experienced officer, threatened on their side a long and obstinate de∣fence. Nothing in fact was defici∣ent on either part. The enemy made some sallies; one of them with considerable effect. Major gen. Crawford was made prisoner on this occasion. But our troops were only animated by these checks. A furious attack was made upon the enemies lines which covered the town, and they were carried without much loss; principally by the uncommon intrepidity of a company of marines which had been but newly raised. No action of greater spirit and gallantry had been performed during the whole war.</P>
<P>The town was now entirely a∣bandoned, and the defence con∣fined to the citadel. It was obvi∣ous, that as our fleet prevented all communication with the conti∣nent, and thereby cut off all hope of relief, the place must necessarily be reduced; but the chevalier de St. Croix was resolved to provide for his own honour, when he could not for the preservation of the place entrusted to him, and, since he could not maintain it, to sell it as dear as possible. Ac∣cordingly there was no mention of yielding, until the 7th of June, when there was no longer the slightest prospect of succout, and the place was by no means safely tenable. Then he capitulated, and the garrison marched out with the honours of war.</P>
<P>Thus was the island of Belle∣isle reduced under the English government, after a defence of two months. In this expedition we had about eighteen hundred men killed and wounded. The loss most regretted was, that of Sir William Peere Williams, a young gentleman of great talents and ex∣pectations, and who had made a distinguished figure in parliament. He had but newly entered into the service. He was shot in the night, by having carelessly approached too near a centinel of the enemy. He was the third gentleman of fa∣shion whom in this war, the love of enterprize had brought to an honourable death in these expedi∣tions to the coast of France.</P>
<P>Whatever difference of opinion might have been entertained con∣cerning the value of this conquest, or the price which was paid for it, the rejoicing in London was great and sincere. The general and the land and sea officers employed in the expedition were the subject of very just applause, who with so no∣ble a perseverance had struggled with, and had overcome such great difficulties, and who had the spirit, after such a disaster on their out∣set, to renew an attack under cir∣cumstances nearly as unfavourable as those by which they had been at first foiled. The city of London addressed the King on the occa∣sion. And it was generally expec∣ted that this new proof of our superiority must influence the ne∣gotiation in our favour. Some however were of opinion, that it
<PB N="214" REF="231"/>
would rather exasperate the French, and irritate their pride to renew these efforts which their misfor∣tunes had slackened when they saw us in the midst of a treaty making attempts, and carrying places in Old France, and as it were, in the presence of that haughty court. However as there was nothing done that was not strictly justifiable, no complaint was made, and the trea∣ty proceeded, to all appearance with as much good humour as before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>England and France agree to treat of a separate peace. Epochas propos∣ed by England. Court of Vienna agrees. Objects of the negotiation. Proposals of France with regard to Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. French memorial concerning Spain. Indignation of the English mini∣ster. English answer to the French memorial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT must be observed, that though the courts of London and Ver∣sailles treated separately, it was hi∣therto by no means proposed, that this separate discussion should lead to a separate peace. It was no more than a previous arrangement for the removal of those difficul∣ties, which might prevent the peace of France with England from be∣ing united with the general peace of Europe. But in proportion as the treaty advanced, it became obvious, that the settling of any terms, which had no reference to the signature of something obli∣gatory between the two crowns, could at best be only void and illu∣sory, and might in the end even prove the source of dangerous and captious altercations. The English minister therefore, before he would agree to that definitively upon any point, and particularly upon the epochas, insisted upon two preliminary conditions.</P>
<P>First, that every thing, which should be happily adjusted between the two crowns in relation to their particular war, shall be made obliga∣tory, final, and conclusive, indepen∣dent of the fate of the negotiation of Augsburg.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the definitive trea∣ty of peace between Great Britain and France, or preliminary articles to that end, shall be signed and ra∣tified between the date of that me∣morial and the first of the follow∣ing August.</P>
<P>If these conditions were accept∣ed, then England on her part con∣sented to name determinate epo∣chas, to which the <HI>uti possidetis</HI> should refer; the first of July for Europe; the first of September for Africa and America; and the first of November for the East Indies. The French ministry without con∣testing the epochas themselves, com∣plained of the conditions; of the first, because they said it departed from the letter and spirit of the memorial of the 26th of March, which was the foundation of the whole treaty; of the second, on ac∣count of the extreme shortness of the time allotted for the discussion of some difficult and momentous points; and the adjustment of mat∣ters which regarded a war extend∣ed over the four quarters of the
<PB N="215" REF="232"/>
globe; for the memorial which contained those conditions, was dated on the 17th, and was not received at Paris until the end of June, so that little more than a month was left to obtain the con∣sent of the court of Vienna to a separate treaty, to settle the terms of this treaty, and finally, to ratify it.</P>
<P>If a very uncommon good under∣standing had not subsisted between her imperial majesty and the king of France, it must have been very difficult to have received this con∣sent. But in fact it was immedi∣ately received, and upon one very short and apparently reasonable con∣dition, "That nothing might be stipulated to the prejudice of the house of Austria." But when this condition came to be explained, as we shall see presently, it was so far from facilitating, that it created new obstacles to the peace. How∣ever, this acquiescence of the prin∣cipal of her allies, enabled France to accept of the first condition with∣out reserve; and to the last she ver∣bally, though not in the clearest terms, agreed also.</P>
<P>Things seemed for the present in the best situation, which in this stage of the treaty could be ex∣pected. The basis of the nego∣tiation was solidly established. The article <HI>uti possidetis,</HI> since the taking Belleisle, was a matter of less diffi∣culty, and the epochas were in ge∣neral settled in such a manner, as to coincide with the designs and desires of both parties. The treaty was confined to the two powers, and it was to be perfectly definitive as to them. A time for concluding it, was also in a great measure set∣tled; a circumstance, which if it did not admit sufficient leisure for accurate discussion, cut off however the opportunities of chicane, and seemed to be the most suitable to a candid proceeding, and a sincere desire of peace.</P>
<P>The foundation being thus laid, the superstructure was the next con∣sideration. This superstructure con∣sisted in the adjustment of those compensations which were to be made for the reciprocal conquests (and here the difficulty lay) of the two powers; a punctilio of honour might have intervened at the very first setting out, extremely pernici∣ous to the salutary work in hand; from which party the first proposition should proceed? But in this respect France gave way, and that concession afforded no inconsiderable proof of her pacific intentions.</P>
<P>We must apprize the reader that we do not mean to enter exactly into the whole detail of this nego∣tiation, nor undertake precisely to describe all the turns that were taken in it. This, we imagine, would prove a tedious and unac∣ceptable performance. We shall attach ourselves to the capital ob∣jects which were contended for in this game of policy: We shall en∣deavour to point out the matters which first obstructed, and then finally broke off the treaty; and we shall rest on these things in such a manner, as seems to us fittest for marking out the true spirit of the negotiating powers. Our own ob∣servations shall be very sparingly interposed. We are historians, and not advocates.</P>
<P>The <HI>uti possidetis</HI> being settled as the basis of the treaty, nothing could reasonably be claimed by either party, that was not to be counterpoised by some equivalent from the other; and consequently
<PB N="216" REF="233"/>
it was necessary to adjust and value their several possessions, pretensions and demands. There were six principal objects in this negotia∣tion. First, the limits of the two crowns in North America. Se∣condly, the conquests of Great Britain in the West-Indies, (toge∣ther with the Neutral Islands there.) Thirdly, our conquests in Africa and in India. Fourthly, the ad∣justment of the particular affair be∣tween the English and French in Germany. Fifthly, the conduct which the two crowns were to hold with regard to their respective al∣lies in Germany. And lastly, the restitution of the captures made by England, previous to the declara∣tion of war.</P>
<P>On the first of these articles, France proposed to cede and gua∣ranty all Canada to England; sti∣pulating only that the free and pub∣lick exercise of the Roman Catho∣lick religion should be permitted under the English government, and that those of the old French colo∣nists who chose to retire might have leave to transport themselves from thence, and take away or dis∣pose of their effects. In compen∣sation for this, they required a con∣firmation of the privilege of what fishing they enjoyed on the coast of Newfoundland, under the treaty of Utrecht; and that this fishery might be carried on with advantage, they likewise required the restitution of the isle of Cape Breton, excluding themselves in return from erecting on that island any kind of fortifica∣tion whatsoever.</P>
<P>The affairs in the west Indies, which makes the second capital ob∣ject, they proposed to settle in this manner. They offered to exchange Minorca for Guadaloupe and Mari∣galante; and as to the four Neu∣tral Islands, they insisted that two of them, Dominica and St. Vincent, were held by their natural inhabi∣tants the Carribees, under the pro∣tection of France, and that they ought still to remain in the same condition. With regard to the two others, they proposed to make a fair division; that St. Lucia should remain to France, and that England should enter into possession of Tobago. On this head it is suf∣ficient to observe, that in the opi∣nion of some people, our ministry did not, in this treaty, set the just value on the acquisition they had made; when they looked upon Canada as the great and leading object, and only considered Guada∣loupe and Marigalante in a secon∣dary and subordinate light. This is a question of difficulty, and has been much agitated. Those who dread a fresh American war from the ambition of France, and were struck with the idea of extended empire, preferred the former con∣quest; those who solely considered our interest as a commercial peo∣ple, were generally in favour of the latter.</P>
<P>On the side of Africa, France satisfied herself with demanding either the settlement at Senegal, or the isle of Goree: for which (to∣gether with the restoration of Belle∣isle) they consented to evacuate Gottingen, Hesse and Hanau, and to draw off their army to the Maine and the Rhine. This was certain∣ly a full equivalent. But with regard to the East Indies, they had no tolerable equivalent to offer. They expatiated much in their memorial upon the disadvantages which must arise to the companies of the two nations, from their entertaining
<PB N="217" REF="234"/>
views of conquest, so contrary to the true spirit, and the real interest of these trading establishments; and they concluded by proposing the treaty, formerly settled between the fieurs Godcheau and Saunders, as a basis for the re∣establishment of peace in Asia. It must be re∣marked, that this treaty had been concluded at a time when the affairs of France in the East Indies made a figure very different from their present situation; and therefore it seemed unfair to make this treaty a standard under circumstances al∣together inapplicable.</P>
<P>The war, which has been so long, with so much bloodshed and so fruitlesly carried on in Westpha∣lia, the French strenuously contend∣ed, was from the time of (what they called) the breach of capitula∣tion of Closter-Seven, a war pure∣ly English; and therefore that their conquests in that part of Germany, formed a proper compensation for the English conquests in the other quarters of the world. Our mini∣sters did not attempt formally to refute this assertion; they rather seemed to admit it; and they agreed accordingly to receive the evacuation of these places as an equivalent for cessions to be made on the footing we have already mentioned. On this point there was little difficulty.</P>
<P>The intricate and knotty part was on what we have stated as the fifth object; the conduct of the two crowns with regard to their allies. Here was a real, a capital difficulty. From the beginning of the negotia∣tion, England had declared that they would inviolably preserve their faith to the king of Prussia, and would act strenuously in his support. This picqued the French ministers; who, in their turn, thought them∣selves bound to make a declaration equally strong in favour of the em∣press; and they had, moreover, re∣cently conditioned with the court of Vienna, to admit nothing in the treaty to her disadvantage; words of great latitude. However, in this difficulty, they found out a solution, which it must be con∣fessed, had a very fair and capti∣vating appearance. They proposed that both armies in Germany should observe an exact neutrality; and should be reciprocally bound to af∣ford no sort of assistance, nor to give no sort of offence to the allies of either of the parties. And they proposed further, that as armies in this state of inert neutrality must be a dead and useless expence to the power who maintains them, the French king, from the time his Britannic majesty recalled the Eng∣lish forces from Germany, would cause double the number of French forces from the armies of the Up∣per and Lower Rhine to return in∣to France; and that no French troops should remain in Germany but in proportion to those which the king of England should keep in his pay. It might certainly be urged in confirmation of the pro∣priety of this offer, that in reality these armies, whilst they continued in action, though they worried each other abundantly, afforded no kind of assistance to their allies, and therefore, when they came mutual∣ly to entertain pacific sentiments concerning their own particular quarrel, and were to give an ex∣ample of moderation to the rest of Europe, there seemed to be no reason why they should make ef∣forts in favour of any ally which they had not made, or been able to
<PB N="218" REF="235"/>
make in the hottest time of hosti∣lity.</P>
<P>The last article had its difficulties also. The French insisted, as a point from which they were re∣solved never to recede, upon the restitution of the captures made be∣fore the declaration of war. This demand, they were of opinion, was grounded on the clearest principles of the law of nations, and the most express stipulation of treaties. With∣out entering into these various ar∣guments with which this position might be maintained and attacked, it appeared to many that the ho∣nour of both nations was almost equally concerned, the one to claim, the other as resolutely to refuse this restitution.</P>
<P>On the whole, these proposals, which the French sent to London in a memorial of the 15th of July, formed, though in some respects undoubtedly exceptionable, a very agreeable plan for a treaty of peace. A better could not have been ex∣pected in the first project of an ene∣my, and it might be hoped, that a negotiation thus favourably be∣gun, could not fail of adjusting easily whatever appeared wrong, or supplying whatever was defective in this first draught of the propositions. But fatally for the repose of man∣kind, in the very instant that this fair proposal was made, at the very moment when these strong demon∣strations were given, an act was done which blew up at one explo∣sion, the whole basis of the treaty that had been long and carefully laying, scattered the materials which had been so industriously collected, and so cautiously arranged, and in∣stead of extinguishing, spread the flames of war more widely, and made them rage with new fury. From this time forward all the transaction was full of animosity, resentment and mistrust. The rea∣der has been apprized of the mea∣sures which France had been inva∣riably pursuing at the court of Ma∣drid, and the arguments she em∣ployed to infuse a jealousy into that court. Hitherto however, there was no appearance that these mea∣sures had any effect; but to the infi∣nite surprize and indignation of the British minister, together with the memorial which contained the above recited propositions, Mr. Bussy, the French agent, delivered a private memorial, signifying, that in order to establish the peace upon solid foundations, not to be shaken by the contested interests of a third power, the king of Spain might be invited to accede to guaranty the treaty, and that to prevent the differences which subsisted between Great Britain and this monarchy from being a means of producing a fresh war in Europe, with the con∣sent and communication of his Ca∣tholic majesty, he proposes, that in this negotiation, the three points which had been disputed between the crowns of England and Spain, might be finally settled. First, the restitution of some captures made upon the Spanish flag. Secondly, the privilege of the Spanish nation to fish on the banks of Newfound∣land. Thirdly, the demolition of the English settlements made on the Spanish territories in the bay of Honduras.</P>
<P>It may be easily imagined, from the character of the then secretary of state, in what manner he receiv∣ed these proposals: he rejected with the utmost scorn, the offer of nego∣tiating, through an enemy humbled, and almost at his feet, the disputes
<PB N="219" REF="236"/>
of his nation, with a power ac∣tually in friendship with us. He called upon the Spanish minister to disavow the propositions, which had been said to be made with the know∣ledge of his court. He returned as wholly inadmissible this offensive memorial, declaring, that it would be looked upon as an affront to the dignity of his master, and incompa∣tible with the sincerity of the nego∣tiation, to make any further men∣tion of such a circumstance.</P>
<P>And now he prepared, without delay, an answer to the principal memorial, in a stile rather dictated by the circumstances which accom∣panied that paper, and which suf∣ficiently indicated the designs of France, than what the propositions themselves strictly deserved. In∣deed, as he had by this time con∣ceived an incurable suspicion of the sincerity of France in the whole proceeding, it would not have been prudent to have made those ad∣vances, which on a supposition of good faith and pacific intentions, might possibly have been advise∣able; for though both powers had over and over declared, that their respective propositions, if the treaty should by any accident be broken off, would be considered as re∣tracted or never made; yet it is certain, that things once settled and agreed to, unavoidably stamp their own impression upon any future negotiation, relative to the same subject.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's answer, which is dated on the 29th of July, agrees to the restitution of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and Belleisle, on the compensations proposed by France. It agrees also to receive Canada, but without any new limits or any exception whatsoever; and it adds to the French offer of all Canada, "its appurtenances." It admits the proposal of the partition of the Neutral Islands. It rejects the French demand of Cape Breton, or of any other island in the gulph or river of St. Lawrence; or of any power of fishing in that river, in that gulph, or on those coasts; and it allows the privilege of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland, only on consideration of the demolition of Dunkirk. But the proposed re∣stitution either of Senegal or Goree is utterly refused. The German neutrality is rejected with disdain; and it is declared that Great Britain is unalterably resolved to support the king of Prussia with efficacy and good faith. In addition to the of∣fer made to evacuate Hesse, &amp;c. it is insisted that the French shall make a general evacuation of all her conquests in Westphalia, and all its countries, including its con∣quests from the king of Prussia on the Rhine, though France had be∣fore declared, that they were con∣quered for the queen of Hungary, that they were actually governed in her name, and that she could not, consistently with good faith, agree to deliver them to the king of Prussia. The treaty between Saunders and Godcheau was not admitted as a proper basis for a treaty relative to the East Indies. But it was agreed, that the two companies should negotiate con∣cerning their respective interests, as the king of Great Britain could not dispose of the rights of the English East India company with∣out their consent. As to the resti∣tution of the captures before the war, this was most positively re∣fused.</P>
<P>In this period we leave the ne∣gotiation
<PB N="220" REF="237"/>
to follow the motions of the armies in Germany. It is cer∣tain, that the dispositions of the two courts grew daily more unfa∣vourable: their confidence in each other, and their mutual good-will wore away; and it was to be fear∣ed, that this negotiation, if it broke off in an unsatisfactory manner, must leave impressions on the minds of the two nations of such a nature, as might cause them to wish they had never en∣gaged in it.</P>

<P>ALthough the great purpose of the early and strenuous effort made by the allies was not fully answered, it nevertheless produced, as we have before observed, a very considerable and useful effect. The destruction of the French magazines retarded their operation in such a manner, that the greatest part of the month of June was spent be∣fore their armies found themselves in a condition to act. But as soon as they had taken proper measures for their subsistence, the prince of Soubise caused his troops to pass the Rhine, and to advance on the side of Munster, not far from which city the hereditary prince of Bruns∣wick was posted to oppose him. Marshal Broglio assembled the forces under his command at Cassel, and moved towards the Dymel, in or∣der to effect a junction with the body under the prince of Soubise. They made no doubt that their conjoined strength would soon at∣tain a decided superiority over the allies, who had ended their late enterprize with a loss which was considerable, and which in their circumstances, they could not well bear, nor easily supply.</P>
<P>These hopes were supported by the success of their first encounter. General Sporcken with a strong de∣tachment had been posted in an ad∣vantageous situation on the Dymel, and in the front of the allied army. On the approach of Marshal Broglio, he attempted to retire with all that expedition which hsi infe∣riority made necessary. But the French came upon him with such rapidity, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">29th June.</NOTE> they overtook and attacked his rear, which was instantly routed; they took eight hundred prisoners, nineteen pieces of cannon, four hundred horses, and upwards of an hundred and seventy waggons. The same day they passed the Dy∣mel; and whilst prince Ferdinand, discouraged by this check, fell back to the Lippe, they made themselves masters of War∣burg, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2d July.</NOTE> Dringleburg, and Paderborn.</P>
<P>The allies, however, soon reco∣vered their spirits; and the main
<PB N="221" REF="238"/>
body of their army being well se∣cured, they sent out several detach∣ments. Their small bodies were conducted by general Luckner, and other able partizans, who under∣took several bold and very distant enterprizes, attacked the enemy where they were least upon their guard, routed their convoys, de∣stroyed several of their magazines, carriages and horses, and carried off their prey even from the gates of Cassel. These lively actions seemed a prelude to some more im∣portant and decisive attempt.</P>
<P>The French became sensible that a stroke of some importance was expected from the greatness of their force, and that it was not for the credit of their arms only, but for their security from the minute, but continual and galling attempts of parties from the allied army.</P>
<P>For some time prince Ferdinand had been posted to the south of the Lippe, between Ham and Lipstadt. This position he took, in all pro∣bability, because M. Broglio had, by occupying the places on the Dy∣mel, got between him and Hano∣ver. Therefore he judged it expe∣dient for him in his turn to get be∣tween the prince de Soubise and the Rhine. In this situation, if the enemy attempted any movement to∣wards the king's dominions, he was ready to fall directly on the places they occupied by that river, which, in the present circumstances, were full as important to them as the Hanoverian territory was to us. Thus whilst he seemed to retire from that territory, and in a man∣ner to abandon it, he in reality provided with the greater effect for its security.</P>
<P>Marshal Broglio, when he had resolved on the attack of the allied army, united his troops to those of the prince de Soubise, at a place called Soest, between Lipstadt and Ham. On the other hand, as soon as the general of the allies was ap∣prized of their intention he posted his army in a very strong and ad∣vantageous manner.</P>
<P>The river Aest runs for a consi∣derable way, almost parallel to the Lippe, from which it is not distant in some places, much more than half a mile. The high road from Lip∣stadt to Ham passes between these rivers; and it was of the utmost moment to prince Ferdinand to se∣cure that important communication, by which alone he could hope an advantageous retreat, or in any de∣gree propose to command the ad∣jacent country. With a view there∣fore to protect that communica∣tion, he established his left wing on the Isthmus between the rivers. The left extremity of that wing under general Wutgenau, leaning to the Lippe, by which it was per∣fectly secured, as the right was supported by the village of Kirch Denkern, situated immediately on the Aest. The marquis of Granby commanded in that wing, with the assistance of lieutenant gen. Howard and the prince of Anhalt, who were posted towards the above-mention∣ed village.</P>
<P>At that village, another river cal∣led the Saltzbach, small, but very deep, joins the Aest almost in a right angle. Behind this river on a considerable eminence was placed the centre, commanded by general Conway; and on a con∣tinuation of the same eminence, the right wing, under the here∣ditary prince, stretched out to∣wards the village of Werle, and it was well defended on the flank by
<PB N="222" REF="239"/>
rugged, bushy, and almost imprac∣ticable ground. Nothing could be more advantageous than this dis∣position of the army, by which the whole centre and right wing were covered in front by a river, and the left supported by rivers on both its flanks. In the left indeed, was the strength and flower of the army; the count of Lippe had placed also in this wing, the greatest part of the artillery, as he knew that it defended the most important situa∣tion, was the most exposed in front, and consequently would be the ob∣ject of the enemy's most consider∣able efforts.</P>
<P>He was not mistaken in his con∣jecture. On the 15th of July, in the evening, a very furious attack was made on lord Granby's posts, which was sustained for a long time with all the intrepidity and firmness, which British troops always exert, and which that gallant officer knows so well how to inspire. The disposition we have just mentioned, was not then compleated; so that they had the whole torrent of that impetuosity, which distinguishes the French in their first attacks, to re∣sist for some hours, until Wutgenau, according to the plan originally projected, arrived to their assistance, and then with efforts united and redoubled in a long and obstinate combat, which continued until it was quite dark, they repulsed the French, and drove them into the woods.</P>
<P>By the next morning, the disposition of the al∣lies <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16th.</NOTE> was perfected; and it was evi∣dent that the French, far from be∣ing dismayed by their misfortune, were preparing for a more general and better sustained attack than the former. M. Broglio commanded against our left, which, as on the preceding day, was the principal object of the enemy. The prince de Soubise led their centre and their left. The engagement began at three in the morning, and it was a severe and continued fire for up∣wards of five hours, before the least effect could be perceived on either side. The weight of the attack this day lay on Wutgenau's corps, which supported it with a degree of bravery, that rivalled the stand which had been lately made by the British forces. But about nine, the prince discovered that the enemy were preparing to erect batteries on an eminence, in the front of the marquis of Granby's camp, which he had not been able to enclose within his lines. Sensible of the pressing necessity there was of pre∣venting the enemy from seizing on an eminence, from whence they might cruelly gall his army, he called in a reserve, which had been placed at the other side of the Lippe under general Sporcken. Strength∣ened by this supply, and encouraged by the irresolution which now be∣gan to appear in the motions of the enemy, he commanded the troops which were nearest at hand to ad∣vance upon them.</P>
<P>This movement was decisive, the enemy gave way, fell into disor∣der, and retired with precipitation. Their centre and left, which had not been able to pass the Saltzbach, after a long and ineffectual can∣nonade, retired with the rest, and covered their retreat; so that fa∣voured by this circumstance, and the closeness of the country, which was full of hedges, they marched off in tolerable order, and were pursued but a little way. How∣ever, their loss was considerable:
<PB N="223" REF="240"/>
the regiment of Rouge, consisting of four battalions, with its cannon and colours, was entirely taken by the single battalion of Maxwell. Their whole loss in killed, wound∣ed, and prisoners, has been esti∣mated at five thousand. The allies had about three hundred killed, a thousand wounded, and about two hundred prisoners. This action was the climax of the campaign of 1761, in Westphalia; it did the greatest honour to the wisdom of the accomplished commander in the disposition, and to the bravery of the troops in the combat; but it was far from decisive. Notwithstanding the loss the French suffered, they were still much superior, in their numbers. On this misfortune the old ill understanding between Sou∣bise and Broglio broke out with fresh animosity. Narratives, me∣morials, and replies, conceived with great bitterness, were mutually re∣mitted from both marshals to their court. Marshal Broglio alledged, that his misfortune was owing to the prince de Soubise's delay, who did not begin the attack till it was too late for him to continue it; the prince de Soubise, on the other hand, suggested, that Broglio be∣gan his attack earlier than the time that had been fixed, in hopes of forcing the allies without Sou∣bise's assistance; and when he found that point lost, obliged Soubise to retreat, that he might not have the honour of recovering it.</P>
<P>The allies after this battle kept their ground for some time, whilst the French retreated. It is impos∣sible regularly to account for all the unexpected turns which have happened, perhaps, more in this campaign, than in any of the for∣mer. It is enough to know that the original superiority of the French, together with their oppor∣tunity of continual reinforcement, may very tolerably explain the rea∣son of the advantages which they so often obtained after very consi∣derable defeats. This is a point which it is necessary the reader should continually keep in his mind during the whole narration of this strange war. After their late loss and retreat, the French soon ad∣vanced again. The party under the prince de Soubise passed the Lippe, and made dispositions for the siege of Munster, whilst marshal Broglio's army turned off on the other side, crossed the Weser, and threatened to fall in upon Hanover.</P>
<P>This division of the enemy com∣pelled prince Ferdinand, though little in a condition for it, to di∣vide his army also. The heredita∣ry prince posted himself to cover Munster; whilst prince Ferdinand continued in the country towards the Weser, to observe the motions of marshal Broglio.</P>
<P>Whilst these various positions were mutually taken, as the armies were continually moving near each other, a number of very sharp skir∣mishes ensued. Marshal Broglio cautiously avoided a battle when∣ever he saw that the duke of Bruns∣wick, by calling together his troops, had prepared for, and was de∣sirous of it; so that there was no way left, but if possible, to check his motions, and wear down his force, by reiterated lesser actions. These actions were almost always to the advantage of our troops. In one of them however, the young prince Henry of Brunswick was mortally wounded; and the whole army saw with <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20th.</NOTE> regret, the disappointment of such
<PB N="224" REF="241"/>
great hopes as were formed from the rising gallantry of a prince, who so nobly supported the martial spirit of his family, and had fallen whilst he was emulating the heroic actions of his brother the hereditary prince and his uncle Ferdinand.</P>
<P>On the side of Westphalia, the prince de Soubise persevered, not∣withstanding some checks, in his design of laying siege to Munster; there was great reason to apprehend that he might succeed in that en∣terprize, as it was always in marshal Broglio's power, by taking some steps on the side of Hanover, to make it necessary to draw away the greatest part of the force destined to the succour of Munster. He therefore began to make the pre∣vious arrangements at Dorsten. The hereditary prince, who knew that he was continually liable to be called off, took the first opportunity of attacking this place. A battalion of French <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 30.</NOTE> troops formed its garrison, and made a brave defence, but it was assaulted with so much resolution and perseverance, that they were obliged to surrender prisoners of war. The prince totally destroyed the ovens which were established here, and by this means not only frustrated their design of besieging Munster, but compelled them for a time, to retire from the Lippe.</P>
<P>As to prince Ferdinand, he saw clearly, that the intentions of mar∣shal Broglio were to make himself master of his majesty's, and the duke of Brunswick's territories. To attempt to follow him, and to beat him from thence, would only be irrecoverably to transfer the seat of war into those countries, and whol∣ly to abandon Westphalia to the enemy. Diversion therefore, and not direct opposition, became his object. He resolved, that as often as he perceived Marshal Broglio's making any progress on the suspected quarter, he should throw himself as far into Hesse as the enemy had advanced towards Hanover, and by stopping their subsistence, oblige them to quit their enterprize. This plan at first succeeded to his wishes, and drew back marshal Broglio into Hesse, upon whose approach prince Ferdi∣nand retired to his old quarters at Paderborn, and was ready for a new movement as <NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Oct.</NOTE> soon as Broglio should return to the execution of his former design.</P>
<P>Accordingly he soon returned to the Weser. Then the hereditary prince, who had by this time re∣joined the grand army, advanced into Hesse, and pushed to the far∣thest extremities of that country, even as far as Fritzlar; but though he succeeded so far in his attempts as to destroy all the lesser magazines which he found in the open coun∣try; yet as all the fortresses were in the hands of the enemy, as the garrisons had been newly reinforced and the grand magazines were well secured in those places, he kept his ground in his advanced po∣sition.</P>
<P>It was on this occasion principal∣ly that prince Ferdinand found the disadvantage of not being able to form two armies, which might act separately. For on one hand, mar∣shal Broglio, when he had perfectly secured his posts in Hesse, took a situation in which he watched all the motions of prince Ferdinand, and kept himself in readiness to fall back into Hesse, or to advance into Hanover, as might best agree with his designs. From hence he
<PB N="225" REF="242"/>
sent out some powerful detachments which acted with great effect One of these detachments entered the Harts Forest (the remains of the great Hercynian, so famous among the antients) and besieged the strong castle of Schartsfelts, which they took and demolished. Then they laid the whole tract of country under severe contribution. Ano∣ther, and still more powerful de∣tachment under prince Xavier of Saxony appeared before Wolfen∣buttel, a considerable city, and strongly situated, as it is wholly surrounded by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 5th.</NOTE> the Ocker. But the French, as they knew that the town is mostly built of wood, commenced their operations with a very fierce bom∣bardment. This had such an effect, that the resistance of the place was not proportioned to its strength; in five days it surrendered, and was subject, like the rest, to a grievous contribution.</P>
<P>Flushed with this success, the French followed their blow, and advanced, keeping still the course of the Ocker, to Brunswick; and began also to invest that city. The reigning prince, unable to protect his subjects, or to secure his person in his dominions, fled to Hamburgh, where he met the landgrave of Hesse, whom the rage of war had in the same manner driven from his territories. This free city now be∣came a place of general refuge, and enriched itself by the calamities, as it had in better times done by the prosperity of Germany. It was lately computed, that the strangers there had increased to forty thou∣sand, amongst whom they could reckon two sovereign princes, and several other persons of the first di∣stinction.</P>
<P>This rapid and unresisted pro∣gress of the French to the eastward of the Weser, was to the highest degree alarming. Prince Ferdinand with all the expedition in his power, detached the hereditary prince to the relief of Brunswick. This measure fortunately saved that very important place. This active commander compelled the enemy not only to raise the siege of Bruns∣wick, but to abandon Wolfenbuttel, and to make a precipitate retreat with the loss of some of their can∣non, and upwards of a thousand men.</P>
<P>Whilst Broglio's detachments proceeded thus in distressing the country to the eastward of the Weser, the prince of Soubise, who by the removal of the hereditary prince of Brunswick to another quarter, saw no longer any thing capable of opposing him, spread his army by detachments over all Westphalia, and ravaged it in the most cruel manner. They took Osnabrug; and because the contri∣butions were not immediately paid, they gave up the place to be pil∣laged by their troops, who rifled the miserable inhabitants without mercy. Another body pushed as far as Embden. This important town was immediately surrendered by the garrison (two English com∣panies of invalids) at the desire of the timid inhabitants, and the pro∣mise of favourable treatment: not∣withstanding this capitulation, and the merit of so easy a surrender, the town, as well as the whole country of East-Friesland, was laid under a ruinous contribution. But their ex∣orbitances grew to such an ex∣tremity, that the boors were at length compelled to rise, and with
<PB N="226" REF="243"/>
such arms as a sudden rage supplied them, to drive these oppressors out of their country.</P>
<P>A more considerable corps com∣manded by the prince de Conde, laid siege to Meppen, a place on the Ems, of some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 3d.</NOTE> consequence, and where we had some magazines. In three days it was reduced, and the garrison of five hundred men were made pri∣soners of war.</P>
<P>The city of Bremen was defended by a weak garrison. This was a place of far greater moment than Mep∣pen, the allies having amassed there immense magazines, as it was a great and trading town, advan∣tageously situated on the river We∣ser; and the possession of this place must undoubtedly have given to the French the command of that river, through which the allies derived all their subsistence. If the English had lost Bremen, they must have seen themselves invested and locked up in a barren country, in the heart of Germany, surrounded by their ene∣mies, and deprived of every re∣source. Fortunately the inhabi∣tants of this city proved as brave as those of Embden were timid. They were exasperated by the ex∣ample of the French rigour, which they had seen on every side of them. They therefore joined the garrison, instead of discouraging them in the defence of the place. The French were obliged to retire precipitately; and a strong reinforcement was thrown into Bremen, to secure that very important city from the like enterprizes for the future.</P>
<P>Whilst the two French armies in this manner ravaged all the country held by the allies, prince Ferdinand, who saw the rage of war spread all around him, with his usual firmness, kept that central position which he had taken soon after the battle of Kirch Denkern; no movements of the enemy could terrify or allure him from it. He had settled his head quarters at Buhne, and his army extended from thence towards Hammelen. Posted in this manner, he secured the course of the Weser, by preventing the enemy from making themselves masters either of Hammelen or Minden; he lay in the best situation in which it was possible to place a single army, that was to act against two; and know∣ing that he could not follow their movements with the body of his army, without hazarding the king's electoral dominions, and indeed every object of the war, he con∣tended himself with sending out such detachments as he could spare, successively to the relief of the places which were attacked. He saw that the winter approached, which had always been a circum∣stance favourable to him; and it was evident that whilst he continued with his main body immoveably fixed as it was, and his detachments active on every side, it was im∣possible for the enemy to keep any of those places, they had seized in their incursions.</P>

<P>UNTIL this year the opera∣tions of the Prussian armies took the lead in interest and import∣ance before all the other events of the war. The firmness and acti∣vity of their illustrious monarch, the number and animosity of his enemies, the blows that he gave, and those that he suffered, his dis∣tressing and terrible falls, his amaz∣ing and almost miraculous recove∣ries, kept all eyes fixed on his moti∣ons, as the great centre of public at∣tention. Undoubtedly nothing that has ever been acted on the scene of human affairs, attracted the minds of men to it with greater justice; none perhaps afforded at once more entertainment to the imagination, and furnished more copious mate∣rials for political and military in∣struction; and probably, therefore, this part of all our modern history, will be the most carefully studied by posterity, when it comes to be pro∣perly known, and worthily written.</P>
<P>To judge of the importance of this branch of the general war, it will be proper to recollect that, be∣sides a number of sieges which were prosecuted, together with innume∣rable and bloody skirmishes, no less than nineteen pitched battles, or capital actions, have been sought on his part since the close of the year 1756, when the king of Prussia first seized upon Saxony, and made an irruption into Bohemia. In eleven of these battles, the King or his generals were defeated. He was victorious only in eight. Ten of them were fought under his own command; and seven out of the eight victories which were gained, were obtained by himself in person; of the eleven defeats, he was present only at three.</P>
<P>From these circumstances some judgment may be formed of the ac∣tive and enterprizing character of this monarch, and of the amazing resource he had prepared, or form∣ed, or seized, and in some instances, one may say, almost created. We have observed that the last campaign had ended more to his advantage, than the one preceding had done; for those two great victories of Lig∣nitz, and Torgau, with which he then ended his operations, had not only rescued his affairs in Silesia and Saxony from impending destruction, but had enlarged his field for re∣cruiting, and prepared him, to all appearance, for more early and vi∣gorous action, than could have been expected in most of the preceding campaigns. But every one was surprized to observe, that this year he had totally altered the system of his conduct. An inactivity and languor was diffused over all his proceedings. He seemed to have adopted the caution and slowness which had been so long opposed to
<PB N="228" REF="245"/>
his vivacity by M. Daun. The summer was almost wholly spent, and the King of Prussia had scarce∣ly been mentioned.</P>
<P>It was not suspected that the pro∣posed negotiation at Augsburg could have had much, if any influence up∣on his method of proceeding. No particular proposals had been made concerning his affairs, nor indeed any other marks of a pacific dispo∣sition towards him shewn, except what were contained in those ge∣neral declarations, which a regard to common decency had exacted. It must have added to the anx∣iety of his situation, that Great Britain and France were at that time engaged in a separate treaty, in which the latter power was in a condition to make so many flat∣tering offers in relation to Germa∣ny, that he might well have dread∣ed the withdrawing of that assistance which had hitherto been his great support against all attacks, and his final resource in all his distresses. Perhaps he was well assured, that the faith of Great Britain was proof against every offer, however allur∣ing; in fact it proved to be so; for in rejecting the German neutrality, which the French proposed in the late negotiation, our country af∣forded as convincing a proof of an unshakeable public faith, as any people had ever given to their allies.</P>
<P>However, whilst this point re∣mained in any degree of suspence, it would have appeared natural, that the King of Prussia should make some uncommon exertions to con∣firm the faith of his allies, as well as to put himself upon a more re∣spectable footing at the ensuing congress. It is, notwithstanding certain, that he contented himself with acting wholly upon the defen∣sive; a conduct, which perhaps his circumstances had rendered abso∣lutely unavoidable. Prince Henry commanded an army in Saxony, which entrenched itself strongly un∣der Leipsic. M. Daun continued near Dresden; and these two ar∣mies did no more than watch each other during the campaign. The King was also entrenched in a very strong position in Upper Silesia, not far from Schweidnitz, whilst the fortresses in the lower part of that country were filled with such garri∣sons, as put them out of the reach of any sudden insult.</P>
<P>This position was pointed out by the motions and apparent designs of his enemies. The Russian army was this year, as well as in the for∣mer, divided into two strong bo∣dies; one of which, led by Tot∣tleben, directed its march towards Pomerania: and the other under M. Butterlin, entered into the Up∣per Silesia, advancing towards Bre∣slau. Baron Laudohn entered that province in the part opposite to them, and they proposed to unite their armies, in order to attack the King, or to take Breslau or Sch∣weidnitz in his presence. The remarkable drought in the begin∣ning of the season, which had great∣ly lowered the Oder, facilitated their junction. The Russians spread themselves over all the open coun∣try of Silesia; and exacted heavy contributions. A body of them appeared before Bre∣slau, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1.</NOTE> and began to cannonade the town from seven batteries. Lau∣dohn exerted the whole of his skill to draw the King from his post, and to engage him in a disadvan∣tageous action. Sometimes he ad∣vanced, as if he meant to join the Russians: sometimes his motions
<PB N="229" REF="246"/>
indicated a design on Schweidnitz; these attempts failing, he turned off and made a feint as if he proposed to fall upon the Lower Silesia, in hopes that he might at least oblige the king of Prussia to detach and di∣vide his forces; but the king con∣tinued immoveable in his post.</P>
<P>Whilst these various movements were making with little effect, on the side of Silesia, the other grand division of the Russians ad∣vanced without opposition into Po∣merania; and it was expected that their proceedings would be attended with greater effect since the removal of Tottleben, and the appointment of general Romanzow to the com∣mand. Tottleben had been long suspected, and, it is said, at length convicted, of a secret correspon∣dence with the king of Prussia. The situation of this Monarch oblig∣ed him to fight with every sort of weapon; and Tottleben, a soldier of fortune, without any national at∣tachment or particular allegiance, was a fit object for the king of Prussia's pecuniary stratagems. He did not succeed so well in the at∣tempts of the same kind which he is said to have made upon Laudohn. Every circumstance concurred to render the method of corruption less successful in that quarter.</P>
<P>Colberg, regularly besieged, or closely streightened every campaign, since the Russions made them∣selves masters of the kingdom of Prussia, was now assaulted with greater and more determined force than ever. A strong fleet, consisting of forty sail of all kinds, blockaded it by sea, whilst the army of ge∣neral Romanzow formed the siege by land. On the other hand, the place threatened a defence worthy of its former efforts. This city was from the beginning of the war of greater strength than it had com∣monly been represented; every at∣tempt of the Russians, by demon∣strating where any weakness lay, taught the Prussians, who were fully sensible of its importance, in what part and in what manner it was ne∣cessary to add to its works; and they had omitted no opportunity. In addition to this defence, the prince of Wurtenburg was strongly en∣trenched under the cannon of the town, with a body of six or seven thousand men.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia was extreme∣ly alarmed at the danger of this momentous post, the key of his do∣minions to the north, from the re∣lief of which he was removed, and, as it were, chained down, at such an immense distance. Though Laudohn and Butturlin found abund∣ant employment for all his forces, he resolved to send a considerable detachment under general Platen to the assistance of Colberg. The fer∣tility of his genius proposed two ends from this single expedient. He ordered Platen to direct his march through Poland, and to de∣stroy the Russian magazines, which had been amassed on the frontiers of that kingdom, and from which their army in Silesia drew its whole subsistence. This service might, he hoped, be performed without any considerable interruption to the pro∣gress of the detachment towards Colberg. The event was entirely answerable to his wishes. General Platen ruined three principal ma∣gazines of the enemy. He attack∣ed a great convoy of their waggons; destroyed 500, and burned or dis∣persed the provisions they carried. Four thousand men who protected this convoy were, for the greater
<PB N="230" REF="247"/>
part, killed or made prisoners. Ge∣neral Platen, after this useful and brilliant exploit, pursued his march with the utmost diligence to Pome∣rania.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this blow was no sooner received by the Russians in Silesia, than they were struck with the utmost consternation. They had lately effected one of their pur∣poses <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 25th.</NOTE> by their junction with the Austrians; but this stroke compelled them at once to sever this union, so lately and with such difficulty compassed, to drop all their designs upon Breslau, to re∣pass the Oder, and to retire without delay into Poland, lest their re∣maining magazines should share the same fate with the three above∣mentioned, and their future subsist∣ence be thereby rendered wholly precarious.</P>
<P>So unfortunately circumstanced were the affairs of the king of Prussia, that his wisest schemes and happiest successes could hardly an∣swer any other end than to vary the scene of his distress. The storm which had been diverted from Si∣lesia by general Platen's expedition, was only removed from thence to be discharged with irresistible fury on Colberg. The Russians, when they saw that the measures the king had taken, rendered the completion of both their designs impracticable, resolved at all adventures to secure one of them. Colberg was the ob∣ject of their choice, not only as the place furthest from succour but as the possession of it would be an advantage fittest for answering those ends which were more nearly and properly Russian. M. Butturlin, therefore, as soon as he had esta∣blished his convoys, directed his course towards Pomerania, and be∣ing master of Lansperg, he sent de∣tachments from thence, that cruelly wasted all the adjoining Marche of Brandenburg, without at the same time diverting himself by these ra∣vages from his main intention.</P>
<P>A force of Russians was by this time assembled in Pomerania, to which it was impossible for the king of Prussia to oppose any thing that was in any degree able to contend with them in the field; of course he could not promise himself that imme∣diate raising the siege could be the ef∣fect of these succours. All he could do was to send another detachment to that part, under general Knob∣lock; and hoped that by the union of these several small corps, and by their intercepting or at least distres∣sing the Russian convoys of provi∣sion, the place might be enabled to hold out, until the severe setting in of winter should render the opera∣tions of a siege impracticable.</P>
<P>He was providing in this manner, and studying new methods for the relief of Colberg, to the danger of which place his whole attention was drawn, when an event happened just by him, and, as it were, under his eye, almost as distressing as the taking of Colberg would have proved, and so much the more dis∣tressing, as it was entirely unex∣pected.</P>
<P>On the retreat of the Russians un∣der Butturlin, the king of Prussia imagined himself at liberty. He found a want of provisions in his strong camp near Schweidnitz, and to be the more easily supplied, he approached nearer to the Oder. He was so little in fear of the ene∣my, that on making this movement, he drafted 4000 men from the gar∣rison of Schweidnitz: he thought that the preparations necessary to a
<PB N="231" REF="248"/>
siege would give him sufficient no∣tice, and sufficient leisure to provide for the safety of that important place, from which after all, he had removed but to a very small dis∣tance. Laudohn, who through the whole campaign had watched the king with a most diligent and pene∣trating assiduity, and hitherto had found no part open and unguarded, thought in this instant he perceived an advantage. It was indeed an advantage which would never have appeared as such, but to a general as resolute as sagacious. He re∣solved to attempt this strong place, by a <HI>coup de main.</HI> On the 1st of October at three in the morning, the assault began. An attack was made at the same time on all the four outworks, which the troops, ordered on this important enterprize approached with so much precau∣tion, that they were not perceived by the garrison. They scaled all the four at the same time; and the troops which defended them had scarce time to fire a few cannon shot. On the side of the assailants, not a gun was discharged: but in one of those out-works the fire of the small-arms set fire to a powder magazine, which blew up, and on this occasion about 300 of the Aus∣trians, and about the same number of the Prussians were killed. As soon as the outworks were carried, they prepared to assault the body of the place, which they entered by bursting open the gates, and at day∣break they found themselves mas∣ters of the town, after firing a few shot. Five battalions, making about 3000 men, and lieutenant-general Zastrow, governor of the fortress, were made prisoners. The con∣querors found here a great number of cannon, and a large magazine of meal. Their loss in the whole of this bold and fortunate undertaking amounted, by their accounts, to no more than 600 men.</P>
<P>In a manner so unexpected, and, considering the nature of the fortifi∣cations, so unprecedented, Schweid∣nitz fell for a second time in this war into the hands of the Austrians; and that city, which in the year 1758 had cost the Prussians a block∣ade of some months, and a siege of thirteen days open trenches to re∣cover it, was again lost in a few hours, and with a very inconsidera∣ble damage to those who undertook this daring enterprize.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia felt this grievous blow to the quick. By their possession of Schweidnitz he saw the Austrians enabled to winter in Silesia; he saw that, whilst they held this place, he could possibly make no motion for the relief of any other part of his dominions without exposing Breslau, and along with it the whole of Upper Silesia, to a cer∣tain and irrecoverable conquest. In the first agitations produced by so extraordinary and affecting a disas∣ter, he was disposed to attribute this misfortune to the treachery of the governor, but he was too generous to harbour such a suspicion, for any time, against an officer who had hi∣therto served him with fidelity, and who might have been surprized with an attack of so uncommon a nature, and which the king himself had as little suspected as the governor. He immediately recovered his temper, and said with a smile, <Q>“It is a fatal blow; we must endeavour to re∣medy it.”</Q> He wrote to general Zastrow who commanded there, <Q>“We may now say, what Francis I. of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia, <HI>We have</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="249"/>
<HI>lost all except our honour.</HI> As I cannot comprehend what hath happened to you, I shall suspend my judgment; the thing is very extraordinary.”</Q></P>
<P>Schweidnitz was lost suddenly; but Colberg made a most obstinate and noble defence. At length, however, the garrison began to be sorely distressed for provisions. Ge∣neral Platen quitted the entrench∣ments, which he had maintained in conjunction with the prince of Wur∣tenburg, in order to cover the re∣inforcements, which the numerous and strong detachments of the Russians, who overspread the whole country, had hitherto kept at a dis∣tance. But he had the misfortune to meet an infinitely superior body of the enemy, to be beaten, and to lose part of his convoy; and it was with difficulty he escaped with the remainder to Stetin.</P>
<P>The other (general Knoblock) had established himself at Treptow, which was to serve as a resting place for the convoys; but as general Platen had been repulsed, in the manner we have just seen, Roman∣zow advanced with a large force to Treptow. Knoblock, hopeless of assistance in a town which had scarcely any walls, and invested by a body so vastly superior, yet made a vigorous and gallant defence for five days; he was at length compelled to surrender himself and his body of about 2000 men prisoners of war.</P>
<P>These successive disasters were oc∣casioned by the necessity there was for revictualling Colberg, cost what it would, and, for that end, of dis∣persing the Prussian troops in the face of a Russian army of 50,000 men. This revictualling in these circumstances could not be effected without a singular piece of good for∣tune; and, in order to get into the way of this good fortune, every risque was to be run.</P>
<P>These advantages over Platen and Knoblock raised the spirits of the Russians, and enabled them to con∣tend with the extreme rigour of the season in that northern latitude; they pushed the siege with redoubled efforts. All hope of a supply from the land was absolutely at an end; and though the Russian fleet had been by a violent storm driven off the coast, the succour from the sea was too precarious to be depend∣ed on. In this desperate situation the prince of Wurtenburg became apprehensive, lest his army, which had been unable to relieve the town, by delaying any longer under its walls would only share its fate, and that famine might also oblige him to surrender. He therefore resolved, whilst his men retained their vigour, to break through a part of the Russian army, and to leave Colberg to make the best terms its circumstances would admit. This design he accomplished happily, and with little or no loss.</P>
<P>And now Colberg, hopeless of all relief, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 16th.</NOTE> garrison exhausted, provision low, the fortifications in many places bat∣tered to pieces, after a long siege of near six months, surrendered to the Russians. The governor and the garrison were made prisoners of war. This place was defended by the gallant <HI>Heyde,</HI> who to this time had maintained it successfully against all the efforts of the Russians dur∣ing the war; and as he was dis∣tinguished by the king his master for his merit in the successful defence of it, he had likewise as full assurances of his favours after having on the late occasion conducted himself with his former bravery, though it was
<PB N="233" REF="250"/>
not with the former good for∣tune.</P>
<P>The loss of two such places as Schweidnitz and Colberg, at the two extremities of his dominions, were decisive against the King of Prussia. It was now impossible for him to make any movement by which the enemy could not profit to his al∣most certain destruction. To form sieges, with an army like his, infe∣rior in the field, was impossible. The Russians, by possessing Col∣berg, possessed every thing. They were masters of the Baltick; and they now acquired a port, by which their armies could be well provided, without the necessity of tedious, un∣certain, and expensive convoys from Poland. The road lay almost open into the heart of Brandenburg. Stetin alone stood in their way; but it was obvious that nothing but the advanced season could save Stetin from the fate of Colberg. The Russians, now for the first time, took up their winter quarters in Pomerania.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this whole year past without a regular battle between the King of Prussia and any of his enemies, yet none of the most unfortunate of his campaigns had been so ruinous to him. He had suffered four terrible defeats, with∣out having ballanced them with a single advantage of consequence in the compaign of 1759. Yet in these circumstances it is almost in∣credible how little he really lost. He was able to take the field again the ensuing year in a very respect∣able manner, and to make head against his enemies. In that year he lost a whole army near Landshut; still he was far from broken. Af∣terwards in that same campaign, he gave his enemies two signal defeats, and ended his operations advantage∣ously, and with great glory. But in the year, of which we now write, without suffering any considerable blow in the field, without any striking efforts on any side, his power has gradually crumbled a∣way. The most calamitous de∣feats could not sink him lower. And in the situation in which he stood after the taking of Colberg, we may safely say, that there was scarcely a possibility that he could be preserved from destruction by any thing that lay within the reach of human endeavours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>The negotiation resumed. French concessions. Difference concerning the German alliance. Difference concerning the captures antecedent to the declaration of war. Treaty breaks off. Messieurs Stanley and Bussy recalled.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER having been so long detained on the theatre of war, it is time we should return to take a view of the negotiation for putting an end to the miseries it oc∣casioned. In reality the view, even of this scene, was very gloomy and unpromising. The confidence and good humour of the two courts being subverted, all that followed was rather an altercation than a treaty. It is true, that papers past backward and forward; and the pretensions of each party, the points they agreed to cede, and those which they were determined to adhere to, grew more distinct and explicit. But all that cordiality was
<PB N="234" REF="251"/>
vanished, which is so necessary to∣wards smoothing and clearing a road, which a long hostility had broken up, and so many intricate topics had contributed to embarrass.</P>
<P>Without involving ourselves in the detail of the several memorials which were delivered in, and with∣out referring numerically to the se∣veral articles, it will be sufficient that we briefly state those points which were, or seemed to be, in a fair' way of adjustment between England and France; and after∣wards those on which it should ap∣pear that the negotiation broke off.</P>
<P>After some discussions concern∣ing its proper limits, it was agreed, that all Canada should be ceded to the English. This cession compre∣hended, on one side, all the is∣lands and countries adjoining to the gulph of St. Laurence On the other, it took in all the great lakes, and the whole course of the Ohio, to its discharge into the Missisippi. A territory sufficient for the basis of a great empire.</P>
<P>In drawing this line of division, another question arose concerning the bounds of Louisiana, and the state of the intermediate Indian na∣tion between the lakes and the Mis∣sisippi, who inhabit, or are rather scattered over an immense country, that lies along the back of our co∣lonies all the way from Pensylvania to Georgia. It was therefore very proper that something definitive should be settled on this article, as it might otherwise easily be made productive of a new war. England proposed that all those nations should continue, as she contended they had heretofore been, under the protection of Great Britain, with∣out saying any thing precise as to the dominion of the soil.</P>
<P>France controverted this propo∣sition; she on her part proposed to divide these nations; that those to the northward of the line drawn to ascertain the limits of Canada should be independent, under the protection of England, but that those, which were to the southward, should enjoy the same independence, under the protection of France. Nothing was perfectly settled in relation to this point; but it does not seem as if there could have been any material disagreement up∣on it, had the other matters in de∣bate been adjusted to their mutual satisfaction.</P>
<P>The African contest seemed to have been attended with still less difficulty. The French consented to give up both Senegal and Goree, provided Anamaboo and Acra were guarantied to them.</P>
<P>The momentous question of the fishery was likewise determined. The French gave up their claim to Cape Breton and St. John's, and were satisfied to receive the little island of St. Pierre on the coast of Newfoundland; but even this they were to receive on conditions suffi∣ciently humiliating. They were to erect no sort of fortification, nor to keep up any military establishment there. An English commissary was to reside on the island, in order to see that these stipulations were adhered to. As to the rest, the French were to have the same privileges on the coast of Newfoundland, checked with the same restrictions, which before the war they had enjoyed un∣der the 15th article of the treaty of Utrecht. In conformity to another article of that treaty, and in com∣pensation for the privilege of the fishery, they consented that Dun∣kirk should be demolished.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="252"/>
Concerning the islands of Gua∣daloupe, Marigalante, Minorca, and Belleisle, no great controversy had subsisted from the beginning. It had all along been agreed, that these conquests should be recipro∣cally restored. Neither did the French scruple to adopt our propo∣sal concerning the affairs of the East Indies, nor to make satisfactory de∣clarations concerning Ostend and Neuport.</P>
<P>So many delicate and interesting points were settled, that it does not at first appear what it was that could have retarded the peace. A discussion of the separate interests of two powers only, that are in ear∣nest to agree, may be settled with∣out any very considerable difficul∣ty. The hard and almost inextri∣cable part of the knot, is that wherein the cross concerns and in∣terests of allies intervene. There were two points upon which, if we may form a judgment from appear∣ances, this negotiation unfortunate∣ly broke off. The first was upon the manner in which England and France might be at liberty to assist their respective allies; and on the restitution of Wesel, Gueldres, and such other places as the French had conquered from his Prussian majesty.</P>
<P>On the first member of this prin∣cipal point, the repeated proposals of France for a neutrality in Ger∣many had been uniformly and po∣sitively rejected by our administra∣tion. They were considered as so many attacks upon national integri∣ty. This scheme therefore not being admitted, they would or could come to no agreement, and scarcely to an intelligible explanation either of the mode or the quantity of the as∣sistance which they should be at li∣berty mutually to impart to their German allies, or of the place in which such succours should be em∣ployed. As to Wesel and Gueldres, the French obstinately refused to restore those places. They de∣clared that such a cession would be directly against the faith by which they were bound to the empress queen of Hungary, for whom they insisted that these places had been conquered, and in whose name alone they were governed, though they had been reduced by the French arms, and were at that moment held by French garrisons.</P>
<P>As to the second point, namely, the restitution of captures made previous to the declaration of war, the negotiating powers were equally positive, the one to demand, the other to refuse it. The English argu∣ed that this claim had no sort of foun∣dation in the law of nations, nei∣ther was it grounded on any parti∣cular convention. That the right of all hostile operations results, not from a formal declaration of war, but from the hostilities which the aggressor has first offered; that the contrary of this proposition is at least extremely contestible; and since it can by no means be clearly established, it follows that the de∣tainment of those captures must be considered, on the side of Eng∣land, as part of the <HI>uti possidetis,</HI> ori∣ginally proposed as the basis of this treaty.</P>
<P>France, on the other hand, seem∣ed as fully convinced of the justice of her pretensions, and she deemed the arguments with which she sup∣ported them to be so unanswerable, that she offered to submit them to the justice of the English tribunals. They urged that this claim of resti∣tution was founded on the law of
<PB N="236" REF="253"/>
nations, and upon particular con∣vention; on particular conven∣tion; by the 19th article of the peace of Utrecht; and by the se∣cond article of the treaty of com∣merce; and that this was strength∣ened by the 3d article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, which renews and confirms those articles in the preceding treaties.</P>
<P>By these articles a protection is allowed to the respective subjects who may have ships in the ports of either of the powers, because hav∣ing no opportunity of knowing that a rupture is fallen out, they sailed under the security of peace and un∣der the saith of treaties. By a pa∣rity of reasoning, the ships not actu∣ally in those ports ought to enjoy the same security; else, as they are included in the same parity of cir∣cumstances, it would follow, con∣trary to the principles of humanity and right reason, that the sove∣reigns had provided for the preser∣vation of one part of their subjects from the miseries of a sudden rup∣ture, to which they expose the rest. The particular conventions of these treaties, they said, had their foun∣dation in general equity and the law of nations; since, as it is im∣practicable for belligerent states to agree amongst themselves which is the aggressor, it is proper that the subjects should receive previous no∣tice of the rupture, in order that they may be able distinctly to know when they are, or are not in secu∣rity, or when they may, or may not rely on the treaties which sub∣sist between their sovereigns.</P>
<P>These topics were as usual, ban∣died to and fro with great heat and little effect; and as in such discussi∣ons the arguments on both sides are plausible, and there can be no authorised judge, the weight of the several pretensions commonly depends upon the power of the par∣ties to enforce them. On these two points therefore, the renunciation of German alliances, and the resti∣tution of captures, the negotiation from the beginning was at a stand; and on these at length, to all ap∣pearance, it finally broke off.</P>
<P>Not but we are fully satisfied that the disagreement even on these points might have been only the os∣tensible cause of the rupture. The true cause of the breach seems to have been the unseasonable inter∣position of the Spanish claims. For could France be supposed in good earnest to desire peace, that is, to desire such a reasonable peace as her circumstances might demand, when she officiously mingled with our particular debate, the affairs of a foreign and neutral power, which had not the smallest connection with those that were at this time proper∣ly under deliberation? It was ridi∣culous to urge, that this was done from a prudent foresight, and to prevent a future war, which these disputes might possibly occasion. The business was to put an end to the war which then actually subsist∣ed; and nothing could be farther from assisting this design than to in∣crease the subjects of debate. France must be sensible of the weight of this argument, who herself propos∣ed in the very beginning of this treaty, as means almost necessary for carrying it on with effect, that their particular dispute should be separated from those of their Ger∣man allies, with which it certainly had a more natural connection than with those that subsisted between England and Spain; as all the for∣mer parties were then engaged di∣rectly
<PB N="237" REF="254"/>
or indirectly in the war, to which Spain had then no manner of relation.</P>
<P>The English ministry finding the French immoveable on the two ca∣pital points above-mentioned, and having no opinion of the sincerity of their procedure, sent directions to Mr. Stanley to return to England, and to desire that M. Bussy should, on the part of his court, receive the same orders. <NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Sept.</NOTE> An end was thus put to this negoti∣ation, (from which Europe had conceived such sanguine hopes of the alleviation of its miseries) after it had continued near six months. So far indeed was it from producing the happy effects that were propos∣ed from it, so far was it from appeas∣ing the animosities of the powers originally engaged, or from extin∣guishing the old war, that the par∣ties separated with intentions more hostile, and opinions more adverse than ever; and the war was soon spread to a much greater extent by the taking in of a new party, and may possibly spread, still more widely, by laying open new sources of contention which may gradually draw in other powers, and finally involve every part of Europe. It was also a means of producing changes in England, which at a time of less tranquility, and in cir∣cumstances of less internal strength, might have been productive of the most fatal consequences. But these matters are reserved for the subject of the ensuing chapter.</P>
<P>The leading negotiation in Lon∣don and Paris being thus broken off, that which was proposed at Augsburg never took place.</P>

<P>AS nothing could have been more unprecedented, so no∣thing was more alarming than the proceeding of the court of Spain in the negotiation. It was altogether extraordinary to see a proposal for accommodating disputes that sub∣sisted between friends, coming thro' the channel of an enemy. It was extremely singular to see points of such consequence formally commu∣nicated and proposed for delibera∣tion by a French agent, commission∣ed only to negotiate a particular and distinct business, when the Spa∣niards had an ambassador residing in London, from whom no sort of intimation had been previously re∣ceived of such a design.</P>
<P>That proposal not only marked out a want of sincerity on the part of France, but it manifested so strange and irregular a partiality on the part of Spain, that it would very little have become the dignity of the King of Great Britain, or his attention to the safety of his sub∣jects, to let it pass without a full and satisfactory explanation. Ac∣cordingly the Spanish ambassador was called upon to disavow this ir∣regular procedure; but he returned
<PB N="238" REF="255"/>
a verbal, and soon after was autho∣rised by his court to return, a writ∣ten answer in which he openly a∣vowed and justified the step taken by the French agent, as entirely agreeable to the sentiments of his master. He declared that the Kings of France and Spain were united not only by the ties of blood, but by a mutual interest. He applauded the humanity and greatness of mind which his most Christian majesty demonstrated in the proposition that was complained of. He insist∣ed much on the sincere desire of peace, the only motive which in∣fluenced the conduct of the two mo∣narchs; and he added, haughtily, that if his master had been govern∣ed by any other principles, "his Catholic majesty giving full scope to his greatness, would have spoken from himself, and as became his dignity."</P>
<P>It appeared evidently from the whole of this paper, that the court of Spain was regularly, as a sort of party, apprised of ever step that was taken in the negotiation; that her judgment was appealed to up∣on every point, and her authority called in aid to force the acceptance of the terms which were offered by France; in a word, that there was a perfect union of affections, interests, and councils between these two courts; and the minister of the former, so far from denying or palliating this conduct, seemed to glory in it.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt who then took the lead in the ministry, was fully satisfied the intentions of Spain were by no means equivocal, and that this partiality, which they strongly avowed not only by declarations, but by facts, would drive them into all the mea∣sures of France. That a war on that account was absolutely inevitable; and if, for the present moment, the Spaniards rather delayed their de∣claration of war, than laid aside their hostile intentions, it was in order to strike the blow at their own time, and with the greater ef∣fect; that therefore their reasons for delaying to act were the very motives, which ought to induce us to act with the utmost speed, and utmost vigour. That we ought to consider the evasions of that court as a refusal of satisfaction, and that refusal, as a declaration of war. That we ought from prudence as well as from spirit to secure our∣selves the first blow; and to be practically convinced, that the early and effective measures, which had so large a share in reducing France to this dependence upon Spain, would also be the fittest for deter∣ring or disabling Spain from afford∣ing any protection to France. That, to carry on this war with vigour, it was only necessary to continue our present efforts; no new arma∣ment would be necessary; and that, if any war could provide its own re∣sources, it must be a war with Spain. That their flota had not yet arrived, and that the taking of it, would at once disable theirs and strengthen our hands. This procedure so suit∣ed to the dignity of the nation, and the insults it had received, would be a lesson to Spain, and to every other power, how they should pre∣sume to dictate in our affairs, and to intermeddle with a menacing medi∣ation, and an officiousness as insi∣dious as it was audacious. That he would allow our enemies, whe∣ther secret or declared, no time to think and recollect themselves.</P>
<P>These sentiments, so agreeable to the resolute and enterprising cha∣racter
<PB N="239" REF="256"/>
of this minister, appeared shocking to almost all the rest of his collegues. They admitted that we ought not to be terrified from the assertions of our just demands, by the menaces of any power. They owned that Spain had taken a very extraordinary and very unjusti∣fiable step; but that we ought to ad∣mit and even to wish for, an expla∣nation; this court, upon a sober yet spirited remonstrance, might recall that rash proposition into which they had been perhaps unwarily se∣duced by the artifices of France; that to shun war upon a just oc∣casion was cowardice, but to pro∣voke or court it was madness. And, if to court a war was not in ge∣neral a very wise measure, to desire it with Spain, if possibly it could be avoided, was to overturn the most fundamental principles of the po∣licy of both nations. That this desire of adding war to war, and enemy to enemy, whilst we had our hands already as full as they could hold, and whilst all our faculties were strained to the utmost pitch, was ill to calculate the national strength of our country, which, however great, had its limits, and was not able to contend with all the world; that whilst we were call∣ing for new enemies, no mention was made of new allies, nor indeed of any new resource whatsoever. To plunge into such measures, in the manner proposed, and upon no better grounds, could not fail to scandalize and to alarm all Europe; and we could possibly derive no ad∣vantage from this precipitate con∣duct, which would not be more than counter-balanced by the jealousy and terror it would necessarily create in every nation near us. As to the seizure of the flota, it was not to be reckoned upon, as at the very time of that deliberation it might be ex∣pected to be safe in its harbour; and perhaps if we could succeed in seizing it, we might perform a ser∣vice not very agreeable to neutral nations, and as little advantageous to our own commerce. If Spain, blind to her true interests, and mis∣led by French councils, should give in a more decisive manner into the designs of that court, and obstinately refuse a reasonable satis∣faction, it would be then the true time to declare war, when all the neighbouring and impartial powers were convinced that we acted with as much temper as resolution, and when every thinking man at home should be satisfied that he was not hurried into the hazards and ex∣pences of war, from an idea of chi∣merical heroism, but from inevitable necessity; and that in such a case we might depend upon the utmost support which the nation could give to an administration that depended upon its strength, and yet dreaded to waste it wantonly, or to employ it unjustly. The minister, warmed by this opposition, declared that, <Q>“This was the time for humbling the whole house of Bourbon; that if this opportunity were let slip, it might never be recovered; and if he could not prevail in this in∣stance, he was resolved that this was the last time he would sit in that council. He thanked the ministers of the late king for their support; said he was himself called to the ministry by the voice of the people, to whom he considered himself as accounta∣ble for his conduct; and that he would no longer remain in a situ∣ation which made him responsi∣ble for measures he was no longer allowed to guide.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="257"/>
The noble lord, who presided in this council, to whom years have added the wisdom of experience, without abating the vigour and fire of youth; and who was himself as bold a minister as ever directed the affairs of this nation, made him this reply. <Q>“I find the gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I say I am sorry for it, since he would otherwise have certain∣ly compelled us to leave him; but, if he be resolved to assume the right of advising his majesty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpose are we called to this council? When he talks of being responsible to the people, he talks the language of the house of commons, and for∣gets, that at this board, he is only responsible to the king. How∣ever, though he may possibly have convinced himself of his infallibi∣lity, still it remains that we should be equally convinced before we can resign our understanding to his direction, or join with him in the measure he proposes.”</Q></P>
<P>On the division, the minister himself, and a noble lord closely connected with him, were the only voices in favour of the immediate declaration of war; the rest of the board were unanimously against it.</P>
<P>The reader will observe that to∣gether with those matters, which have been published, relative to this very important deliberation, with some appearance of authenticity, we have added such arguments as have been agitated among the peo∣ple; a liberty necessary to place the matter in its full light.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt and lord Temple, ad∣hering to their first opinion, and having delivered their reasons in writing, resigned their employ∣ments. This resignation seemed equal to a revolution in the state. An universal alarm was spread; a thousand rumours flew abroad, and the first suggestions were, that this great minister, endeavouring to avail himself by his firmness in negotia∣tion of the advantages he had ac∣quired by his vigour in war, was opposed by the whole council, who were resolved to have a peace at any rate, and that this opposition had driven him to resign the seals. But the true cause of the resignation very soon came out; and on this point a violent conflict ensued, in which the popular cause was worse sus∣tained, and the ministerial better, (that is, with greater effect) than is usual in such discussions. Some cir∣cumstances contributed not a little to this success.</P>
<P>When Mr. Pitt resigned the seals, the great person to whom they were delivered received them with ease and firmness, without requesting that he should resume his office. His majesty expressed his concern for the loss of so able a servant; and to shew the favourable sense he entertained of his services, he made him a most gracious and unlimited offer of any rewards in the power of the crown to bestow. His majesty at the same time expressed himself not only satisfied with the opinion of the majority of his council, but declared he would have found him∣self under the greatest difficulty how to have acted, had that council con∣curred as fully in supporting the measure proposed by Mr. Pitt, as they had done in rejecting it. A sentiment (in the light in which his majesty considered this measure) grounded upon the firmest principles of integrity and honour, and which must raise the highest veneration for
<PB REF="258" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="241" REF="259"/>
his royal character not only among his own subjects, but amongst all nations, when they see a power which has so little to fear from any human effort, so very fearful of the least infringement of the strictest and most critical rules of justice.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was sensibly touched with the grandeur and condescen∣sion of this proceeding. `I confess, Sir, I had but too much reason to expect your majesty's displeasure. I did not come prepared for this ex∣ceeding goodness. Pardon me, Sir,—it overpowers, it oppresses me.' He burst into tears.</P>
<P>We are far from an attempt to add any colouring to so exquisitely affecting a picture. We are indeed far from being able to do justice to perhaps one of the most pathetic and elevated scenes which could possibly be displayed, the parting of such a prince, and such a mi∣nister.</P>
<P>The next day a pension of three thousand pounds a year was settled on Mr. Pitt for three lives, and at the same time a title was conferred upon his lady and her issue; a pen∣sion the best bestowed, and a nobi∣lity the most honourably acquir∣ed, and most truly merited. Im∣mediately the Gazette gave notice to the public of all these transac∣tions. The resignation made the first article; the honours and re∣wards the next; and they were fol∣lowed by a letter from our ambas∣sador in Spain, containing an ac∣count of the favourable and pacific language of that court, and of the strong assurance they gave of a de∣sire to accommodate all differences in an amicable manner.</P>
<P>It must be owned that this ma∣noeuvre was very skilfully executed. For it at once gave the people to un∣derstand the true motive to the re∣signation; the insufficiency of that motive, and the graciousness of the K. notwithstanding the abrupt de∣parture of his minister. If after this the late minister should chuse to enter into opposition, he must go into it loaded and oppressed with the imputation of the blackest ingratitude: if on the other hand he should retire from business, or should concur in support of that ad∣ministration which he had left, be∣cause he disapproved its measures, his acquiescence would be attribut∣ed by the multitude to a bargain for his forsaking the public, and that the title and the pension were the considerations.</P>
<P>These were the barriers that were opposed against that torrent of po∣pular rage, which it was appre∣hended would proceed from this resignation. And the truth is, they answered their end perfectly: this torrent for some time was beaten back, almost diverted into an op∣posite course; and when afterwards it returned to those objects, against which it was originally directed, and where it was most dreaded, it was no longer that impetuous and irresistible tide, which in the year 1757 had borne down every thing before it; it was weakened, divid∣ed, and ineffective.</P>
<P>On this occasion the clamorous and inferior members of each party went lengths, which undoubtedly were neither authorised nor ap∣proved by their leaders. The friends of Mr. Pitt raised the most violent clamours for displacing a minister, whose measures had raised the nation from the most abject state, to the highest pinacle of glory. <Q>They said, that “he was in fact displaced, when he was com∣pelled
<PB N="242" REF="260"/>
to resign, by not being suffered to carry into execution those measures which he knew to be necessary to the honour and safety of his country. That the check which this minister had received, would most unseason∣ably revive the drooping hopes of France, sunk by the vigour of our military operations, and the firm∣ness of our councils under his administration, and would shew Spain with what impunity she might insult the honour of the British crown, and violate the property of its subjects. They reckoned up the disgraces which the nation had suffered before Mr. Pitt had entered into the management of affairs, and the victories and conquests which were the fruit of his councils.”</Q></P>
<P>In consequence of these reason∣ings, addresses, resolutions and in∣structions were set on foot in the great corporations; and it was be∣lieved that the example would be followed, as on a former occasion of the same kind, by all the other cities and boroughs of the king∣dom. But the progress of this measure, though commenced with much alacrity, was slow and lan∣guid; a few only of the corpora∣tions entered into it, and some even of these few in a manner less warm than was expected. A strenuous defence was made on the part of the remaining ministry.</P>
<P><Q>“Was it ever heard, said they, that a sovereign has been censured for listening to the whole body of his council, in preference to the particular opinions of a single man? On the contrary, this un∣controuled sway of a single mini∣ster has been often thought dan∣gerous, and was always odious in our free constitution; and is the more justly to be disliked, as per∣haps inconsistent with the true spirit, either of absolute monar∣chy, or of limited government. Let the merit of this minister be what it will, shall his master therefore be forced to receive him upon any terms? Must his prince, to gratify his ambitious views, or if you please, his virtu∣ous intentions, dismiss his whole council, and annihilate his pre∣rogative as a king, his reason and judgment as a man? Was it ever heard before, that a coun∣sellor has professed without any reserve or any mask, that because he could not guide in government, he would not co-operate? This has unquestionably been the true motive for the conduct of many ministers, but never was the avowed motive until this occasion. Mr. Pitt has had the freest scope for the exertion of his genius; he was, perhaps, the only English minister that never met with the slightest opposition; he has had the treasures and the forces of the nation at his most absolute command; let him, in his turn, do that justice that has been done to him; let him, if the favours of the crown constitute no obli∣gation, be bound at least by the rules of equity; and if he will not partake in the conduct of the present most intricate and diffi∣cult business of administration, let him not render it still more intricate and more difficult by his opposition; and let him not study to find a justification of his mea∣sures, from the ill success of those whom he has left, when that ill success will be owing to his own devices.”</Q></P>
<P>Thus far the points seem to have been urged with propriety and
<PB N="243" REF="261"/>
weight. A torrent, however, of low and illiberal abuse was also poured out on this occasion. His whole life, public and private, was scrutinized with the utmost maligni∣ty, to furnish matter of calumny a∣gainst him. The successes of his ad∣ministration were depreciated; his faults were monstrously exaggerated, and the rewards and honours so just∣ly conferred on him by his sovereign, were by every trick of wit, ridicule, and buffoonery, converted into mat∣ter of degradation and disgrace.</P>
<P>Without presuming to take any part in a controversy, which (how∣ever unequally) divided the royal council, or without entering into the sentiments of any faction, which we have always shunned, we may affirm with truth and impartiality, that no man was ever better fitted than Mr. Pitt, to be the minister in a great and powerful nation, or better qualified to carry that power and greatness to their utmost limits. There was in all his designs a mag∣nitude, and even a vastness, which was not easily comprehended by every mind, and which nothing but success could have made to appear reasonable. If he was sometimes incorrect, he was never vulgar.</P>
<P>His power, as it was not acquir∣ed, so neither was it exercised in an ordinary manner. With very little parliamentary, and with less court influence, he swayed both at court and in parliament with an authority unknown before, to the best supported ministers. He was called to the ministry by the voice of the people; and what is more rare, he held it with that approbation; and under him for the first time, admi∣nistration and popularity were seen united. Under him Great Britain carried on the most important war in which she ever was engaged, alone and unassisted, with greater splendour, and with more success than she had ever enjoyed at the head of the most powerful alliances. Alone this island seemed to ballance the rest of Europe.</P>
<P>In the conduct of the war he ne∣ver suffered the enemy to breathe, but overwhelmed them with re-iter∣ated blows, and kept up the alarm in every quarter. If one of his ex∣peditions was not so well calculated or so successfully executed, amends were made by another, and by a third. The spirit of the nation once roused, was not suffered for a moment to subside; and the French, dazzled, as it were, by the multi∣tude and celerity of his enterprizes, seemed to have lost all power of resistance. In short, he revived the military genius of our people; he supported our allies; he extended our trade; he raised our reputation; he augmented our dominions; and on his departure from administra∣tion, left the nation in no other danger than that which ever must attend exorbitant power, and the temptation which may be, to the in∣vidious exertion of it. Happy it had been for him, for his sovereign, and his country, if a temper less austere, and a disposition more practicable, more compliant, and conciliating, had been joined to his other great virtues. The want of these qualities disabled him from acting any otherwise than alone: it prevented our enjoying the joint fruit of the wisdom of many able men, who might mutually have tempered, and mutually forwarded each other; and finally, which was not the meanest loss, it deprived us of his own immediate services.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="262"/>
Those who censured his political conduct the most severely, could raise but few exceptions to it; none of them singly and perhaps, the whole united, of no great weight against a person long engaged in so great a scene of action.</P>
<P>Whether the part, which under his administration we rather conti∣nued to act than newly took, with regard to the affairs of Germany, be for the real interest of Great Britain, is a question of the utmost difficulty, and which perhaps will never admit a satisfactory solution. To condemn him on this head we must be sure of this solution. It has been observed in favour of that contested measure, that France de∣monstrated, through the whole pro∣gress of the late treaty, the most earnest desire, that we should aban∣don the German connection; no trifling argument, that our enemy did not look upon it to be extreme∣ly prejudicial to our interests. If he has carried on that war at a vast expence, a prodigious stand has been made against the entire power of France; had less been expended, the whole expence might have been lost. How far this part of his con∣duct was agreeable to his former declarations, is a discussion which can avail but little. He found the nation engaged in these affairs; it was more easy to push them for∣ward, than to extricate himself from them; as he proceeded, he discover∣ed by experience the advantages of that plan of action, and his opinion was changed.</P>
<P>But even admitting, that, to at∣tain the ends of opposition, he had once fallen upon popular topics, which even then he knew were not tenable, it can form but a very small blemish in a public character, how∣ever wrong it may be by application to the strict rules of morality. Ill would it fare with statesmen if this sort of consistency were to be expect∣ed from the most consistent of them.</P>
<P>With regard to the pension and title, it is a shame that any defence should be necessary. What eye cannot distinguish, at the first glance, the difference between this and the exceptionable case of titles and pensions? What Briton, with the smallest sense of honour and grati∣tude, but must blush for his coun∣try, if such a man retired unreward∣ed from the public service, let the motives to that retirement be what they would? It was not possible that his sovereign could let his emi∣nent services pass unrequited; the sum that was given was undoubted∣ly inadequate to his merits; and the quantum was rather regulated by the moderation of the great mind that received it, than by the libe∣rality of that which bestowed it.</P>
<P>The conduct of Mr. Pitt when the parliament met, in which he made his own justification, without impeaching the conduct of any of his collegues, or talking one measure that might seem to arise from dis∣gust or opposition, has set a seal upon his character.</P>
<P>Lord Egremont was appointed to succeed him as Secretary for the southern department.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Dispute with Spain. Representation of the earl of Bristol. Disposition of the court of Madrid. Treaty between France and Spain. England desires a communication. Court of Spain refuses. The ministers mu∣tually withdraw. A rupture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE unfortunate intervention of Spain in the late negotia∣tion, raised so many difficulties, and created so much mischief both abroad and at home, that it becomes an aera in this history, and it is neces∣sary we should pursue that object from the point at which we left it, to its final and fatal determination.</P>
<P>The answer which had been re∣ceived from the Spanish minister in London was far from being satisfac∣tory to our court. Orders were im∣mediately given to the earl of Bri∣stol, our ambassador in Spain, to re∣monstrate with energy and firmness on so extraordinary a proceeding; to adhere to the negative put upon the Spanish pretensions to fish at Newfoundland; to rest the article of disputed captures, on the justice of our tribunals; to continue the former professions of our desire of an amicable adjustment of the log∣wood dispute; and of our willing∣ness to cause the settlements on the coast of Honduras to be evacuated, as soon as ever his Catholick majesty should suggest a method for our en∣joyment of that traffic to which we had a right by treaty, and which was further confirmed to us by re∣peated promises from that court.</P>
<P>At the same time that the earl of Bristol was authorised to proceed with that spirit, which the offended dignity of our court required, and to bring Spain to a categorical and satisfactory declaration, concerning her final intentions; yet if he per∣ceived on her part any intention to disavow or even to explain away this offensive transaction, he was readily to accept it, and to afford to that court as handsome a retreat as possible. The letter which con∣veyed these instructions was written by Mr. Pitt, and dated on the 28th of July, a few days after the fatal memorial had been delivered by Mr. Bussy.</P>
<P>The earl of Bristol punctually obeyed those orders. He found general Wall, the Spanish minister, much in cold blood, and in very equivocal dispositions. He heard with great patience the proper and energetic representation that had been very ably made by the earl of Bristol. He applauded the king of Great Britain's magnanimity in not suffering France as a tribunal, to be appealed to in his disputes with Spain; and declared, that in the pro∣position which had been made with the consent of his court, things were not considered in that light; asked whether it could be imagined in Eng∣land, that the Catholick king was seeking to provoke us in our present most flourishing and most exalted situation, and after such a series of prosperous events as no single nation had ever met with? He valued, and reciprocally returned, our fre∣quent professions of friendship, and our desire of amicable adjustment. But these favourable demonstrations were accompanied with some cir∣cumstances, that had a very menac∣ing
<PB N="246" REF="264"/>
appearance. For, in the first place, he declared, that at that time the utmost harmony subsisted be∣tween the courts of France and Spain; that in consequence of their perfect agreement, there was a mu∣tual unreserved communication of every step taken in their several ne∣gotiations with England; that France had even offered to assist Spain, in case the discussions she had with us should grow into a rupture; and that this offer was considered in a friendly light. Such an intimate union of a third power with one of the parties at war, forebodes no long duration to its friendship, or even to its neutrality with the other. If Spain justified the proceedings of France, and owned herself concern∣ed in them, it was but one, and that a short, step, to a junction with her.</P>
<P>As to the three matters in dispute, the Spanish minister resolutely ad∣hered to them all; and as to the last (that of the logwood) he observed, that Great Britain had offered them nothing, but what they had long since been tired of, treaty and negotiation; that this matter had been already fully discussed; and that on this head Spain had given the most convincing proofs of her desire to be on the best terms with England; for in the beginning of this war, before England had grown terrible by her successes, when their American governors had endeavoured to dislodge the Eng∣lish from some new establishments on the coast of Honduras, they had at the complaint of our court, in order to take away all cause of mis∣trust, ordered the governors to de∣sist from so justifiable an enterprize. That on the offer of England on this occasion to settle matters in an amicable manner, they chearfully agreed to that method. But that six years had elapsed without their receiving the least satisfaction. They even alledged that the Eng∣lish encroachments on their coasts in that time increased.</P>
<P>In this manner the Spaniards vin∣dicated the form and the matter of their proceeding: they shewed no sort of disposition to relax from their claims; but at the same time they no longer insisted on blending toge∣ther the several discussions; and they professed, in general, though not in very warm terms, a desire of continuing in amity with us. With regard to the matter in dispute, the pretensions of both powers stood in this posture throughout this whole discussion; except that they were urged with more or less asperity, according to the fluctuating disposi∣tion of the court of Spain, which seemed to rest upon no sure and set∣tled principles. There were pro∣bably two factions in her councils, who as they alternately prevailed, changed the language and counte∣nance of the Spanish minister. However, for some time the aspect of things continued on the whole to be rather favourable: and even an express declaration was at length made, that Spain had been, at no time, more intent on cultivating a good correspondence with us. But still the French interest silently gain∣ed ground at Madrid; the confi∣dental communications of that court with Spain; her affected moderation in the treaty; the dangerous great∣ness of England: the common in∣terest of the house of Bourbon, every part of which must suffer, both in its dignity and safety, by allowing the principal of its branches to be pruned to the quick; these points were urged with continual sollici∣tation;
<PB N="247" REF="265"/>
and they assured the Spa∣niards that even the signing an al∣liance between the sovereigns of the two nations, would intimidate Eng∣land, already exhausted by the war, and apprehensive of losing the va∣luable commerce she carried on with Spain.</P>
<P>These arguments and suggestions at length prevailed, and a treaty was signed between the two courts, the purpose of which was to pre∣serve from oppression and to main∣tain the interests of the house of Bourbon. This alliance was of a nature the more dangerous, as it turned upon family not national in∣terest, and because not stating ex∣actly its objects, it might be made just of what extent they pleased. We make no mention of any other treaty than this, of itself sufficiently alarming, because whatever sus∣picions may be entertained, there is no certainty that any other has been concluded between those powers.</P>
<P>France had obtained in this trea∣ty almost all that she aimed at; by it she entered into the closest connecti∣on with Spain; this connection did not indeed seem directly and of ne∣cessity to conclude a breach with Eng∣land; it led to it however, almost inevitably. At first the whole trans∣action was kept a profound secret; the inferiority of the marine of Spain, and the precariousness of their supplies from America, in case they came to a present rupture with England, obliged them to this tem∣porary reserve. France took care that this treaty should not transpire until the negotiation was broken off; and Spain, whilst she was under these apprehensions, exhibited those occasional proofs of a pacific dispo∣sition, which we have just now seen. But as soon as France had lost all hopes of concluding the negotiation in the manner she had wished, and had failed in the use she made of the intervention of the claims of Spain, she circulated with great industry a report, that Spain would immediate∣ly declare against Great Britain, in consequence of a treaty lately con∣cluded among the Bourbon courts.</P>
<P>England found that those boats of the French were too confidently made, and too generally believed, to be altogether without foundation. In consequence of these apprehen∣sions, orders were sent to Spain, to demand in the most moderate terms, but in a manner not to be evaded, a communication of this treaty, or at least a disavowal that it contained any thing to the prejudice of Great Britain. But before these orders could reach Spain, lord Bristol had himself received intelligence of the treaty, and of the hopes, which the French made no secret of their de∣riving from that source. He there∣fore thought himself under a neces∣sity of desiring satisfaction from the Spanish secretary of state concern∣ing it.</P>
<P>Upon this application there ap∣peared on a sudden such a change in the countenance, language, and sentiments of that minister, as indi∣cated but too fully the justness of the suspicions that were entertained. The Spanish flota was now safely arrived with a very rich cargo; the French arms had made a consider∣able progress in the king's electoral dominions; the success of the Im∣perial arms was no less striking; the reasons for their former shew of moderation no longer existed. They therefore gave a loose to those movements which they had hitherto concealed. M. Wall, evading a
<PB N="248" REF="266"/>
direct answer, entered into a long and bitter complaint, not only of the treatment which Spain had re∣ceived from us, but of the haughti∣ness of our late proceedings with France; that it was time for them to open their eyes, and not to suffer a neighbour, an ally, a relation, and a friend, any longer to run the risque of receiving such rigid laws as were prescribed by an insulting conqueror; that we were intoxicated with our successes; and a continued series of victories had elated us so far, as to make us reject the reasonable con∣cessions offered by France. This re∣fusal made it evident, that our de∣sign in ruining the French power, was the more easily to crush Spain; that we proposed entirely to chase the French from all their colonies in America, to have the easier task in seizing on the Spanish dominions in those parts, thereby to satisfy to the utmost our ambition, and to gratify our boundless thirst of con∣quest; therefore he would himself be the man to advise the king of Spain, that since his dominions were to be overwhelmed, at least that they should be seized with arms in his subjects hands, and not to con∣tinue the passive victim he had hitherto appeared in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>The English ambassador, though astonished at so extraordinary a change of stile, replied with cool∣ness to the invectives, and with firm∣ness to the menaces of the Spanish minister; he obviated the objec∣tions which had been made, and supported our pretensions; after answering in the best manner to what M. Wall had urged, he return∣ed to his first demand, an explanation concerning the treaty; as often as a direct answer was evaded, the same question was again put; and at length the only reply was, that the king of Spain had thought proper to <HI>renew his family compacts;</HI> and then Mr. Wall, as if he had gone farther than he was authorised, sud∣denly turned the discourse, and no farther satisfaction could be ob∣tained.</P>
<P>This revolution in the appear∣ances of things in Spain, was too in∣teresting not to be immediately com∣municated. Our ministry saw evi∣dently, that the moderation they had hitherto displayed, might be at∣tributed to fear, and that the lan∣guage of the court of Spain would permit no doubt of their hostile intentions. Orders were therefore given to the earl of Bristol, con∣formable to the dignity of the na∣tion, and the justice of our claim. He was ordered to renew his in∣stances concerning the treaty; to demand an explanation with a proper firmness, but without the mixture of any thing which might irritate; and to signify, that a pe∣remptory refusal to communicate the treaty, or to disavow an inten∣tion to take part with our enemies, would be considered as an aggres∣sion on the part of Spain, and an absolute declaration of war.</P>
<P>Things were now brought to a single and precise point. The demand was made in the terms of the order. Then it was that the pride of Spain entirely threw off the remainder of that mask, which her policy had persuaded her to assume; the secretary, M. Wall, replied, <Q>“That the spirit of haughtiness and of discord, which dic∣tated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10th.</NOTE> this inconsiderate step, and which for the misfortune of mankind still reigns so much in
<PB N="249" REF="267"/>
the British government, is what has made the declaration of war, and attacked the King's dignity; and that the Earl of Bristol might return when and in what man∣ner was convenient to him.”</Q></P>
<P>The Earl of Bristol parted from Madrid the 17th of December; and thus was brought on a rupture which has prodigiously extended the operations, and consequently the miseries of war, and threatens to protract them to a very long duration. Europe, unfortunately found herself plunged into the gulph of a new war, at the time she hoped to emerge from the old one, and by the very means which were used to draw her out of it. A point of honour alone seemed to have been the last and immediate cause of the breach; but whoever has diligently attended to the Spa∣nish affairs from the memorial pre∣sented by Bussy to the final answer delivered by Wall, will see that the motives were, however ill under∣stood, of a much more serious and important nature.</P>
<P>As the two powers had now come to extremities, and the English ambassador had departed from Ma∣drid, the Spanish minister also quit∣ted London; but before his de∣parture he left a paper, in the na∣ture of a manifesto, of very little importance in point of argument, but filled with invectives, charging the war on the haughtiness of the late English minister, and on the little respect with which his court had been treated, both during the administration of that minister, and since his resignation. That had the purport of the treaty been desired in a manner less offensive to the dignity of his master, it might as easily have been obtained, as it could have been justified; for the treaty, which was believed to have been signed on the 15th of August, contained only a reciprocal gua∣ranty of the dominions of the se∣veral branches of the house of Bourbon, but with this particu∣lar restriction, that it should on∣ly extend to the dominions which shall remain to France after the present war.</P>
<P>It must be remarked that, this paper, whilst it pretends to set forth the purport of a treaty dated the 15th of August, does not deny the existence of any other treaty, which might more offensively con∣cern the interest of Great Britain. It was however answered in every article with the utmost moderation, perspicuity and force, in a memorial of lord Egremont. Here we close the Spanish transaction; as this is the whole of what belongs proper∣ly to the year we treat of. All that remains for us to do, is to touch upon the affairs of the East Indies and America.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Blockade of Pondicherry. Distress of the French. Fleet dispersed in a storm. Fleet returns. Town surrenders. Mabie taken. Enterprises of Mr. Law. Mogul's army defeated by Major Carnac. Nabob of Bengal deposed. Coast of Sumatra ravaged by the count d' Estaing. Dominica taken by lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the defeat of the French near Wandewash, the taking of the city of Arcot, and the reduction of the fortresses of Chitteput and Carrical, Pondicherry was the only space of consequence which remained to our enemies in India. This town, beautifully built, strongly fortified, and four leagues in circuit, seemed rather the capital of a kingdom, than a trading establishment. It is situated on the coast of Malabar, about for∣ty miles from our settlement at Ma∣drass, which in the days of its prosperity it rivalled, if not exceed∣ed in trade, opulence and splendor; and it still remained the depository of whatever wealth was left to the French, after the reverse of their fortune in war.</P>
<P>As soon as the fortresses adjacent to this important place had been reduced, and the inland country brought perfectly to our interests by the total expulsion of the French, the blockade of Pondicherry was commenced by the land forces un∣der colonel Coote, and the marine under admiral Stevens. A regular siege was at that time impracticable on account of the periodical rains, which were daily expected; and even under more favourable cir∣cumstances it would have proved a task of infinite difficulty to attempt by any army that could be sup∣ported in India, the taking of a place so strongly fortified, defended by a good garrison, and by an officer able and resolute, and whose pride and obstinacy, so prejudicial on all other occasions, would have made him, as in effect they did make him, persevere to the very last moment, in the defence of the last stake, which the French had left in India.</P>
<P>The blockade being therefore chosen as the most eligible for the time, was continued with the best dispositions, and the most extraordi∣nary patience on both sides, for full seven months. In this time the garri∣son and inhabitants suffered sorely by famine. Col. Coote, in order to aug∣ment their distress, erected bat∣teries at a distance, not with a view of ruining the walls, but to harrass the enemy by an encrease of garrison duty.</P>
<P>At length when the weather ap∣peared settled, four batteries were raised at some distance to enfilade the streets of Pondicherry, whilst others were advanced nearer in or∣der to play upon the works. These operations, though the siege was not yet formally undertaken, com∣menced on the 26th of November, 1760, but as the season of the rains and winds was not yet quite over, much was suffered from storms, which ruined the batteries and ap∣proaches. They were however al∣ways repaired with the utmost alacri∣ty and speed, and the siege suffered no intermission. So that the besieged, who eagerly expected the arrival of their fleet to their relief, were re∣duced
<PB N="251" REF="269"/>
to the most extreme distress. They lived on camels, elephants, dogs, and cats. The extreme scar∣city and dearness even of this wretched provision, increased their misery. Sixteen roupies (half crowns) had been paid for the flesh of a dog.</P>
<P>In the midst of this distress their hopes were suddenly revived, and those of the besiegers, notwithstand∣ing the progress they had made, almost totally depressed. On the first of January 1761, one of those terrible storms, so frequent in the Indian sea, and so ruinous, drove the English squadron from before Pondicherry. Two ships of the line were wrecked, and their crews, with the exception of two or three men, entirely perished. Two others of the same class were driven ashore, and beat to pieces. The men fortu∣nately escaped. The real damage which our fleet sustained on this oc∣casion, together with the idea of a far greater, suggested by their own desires, and justified by the violence of the storm, elevated to the highest pitch the spirits of the garrison, sunk by disease, famine, fatigue, and an uninterrupted train of ad∣verse fortune. General Lally seeing the port clear, sent an express without delay to the French agent in the neighbouring neutral settle∣ments, that this was the time to throw in succours; he seemed san∣guine and full of vigour. The let∣ter, which was intercepted, is print∣ed below <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Translation of an intercepted letter from general Lally to M. Raymond, French resident at Pullicat, dated Pondicherry the 2d of January 1761.</P>
<Q>	
<P>Mr. RAYMOND,</P>
<P>The English squadron is no more, Sir; out of the twelve ships they had in our road, seven are lost, crews and all; the four others dismasted; and it appears there is no more than one frigate that hath escaped; therefore don't lose an instant to send us chelingoes upon chelingoes loaded with rice; the Dutch have nothing to fear now; besides (according to the law of nations) they are only to send us no provisions themselves, and we are no more blocked up by sea.</P>
<P>The saving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once already; if you miss the present opportunity, it will be entirely your fault; do not forget also some small chelingoes: offer great rewards: I expect seventeen thousand Morattoes within these four days. In short, risque all, attempt all, force all, and send us some rice, should it be but half a garse at a time. Signed, LALLY.</P></Q></NOTE>, as it may tend to fur∣nish some idea of the character of this singular man.</P>
<P>But admiral Stevens, and those who commanded under him, exert∣ing themselves with unparalleled diligence and celerity, appeared again before Pondicherry in less than four days after the storm, with eleven ships of the line and one fri∣gate, and the blockade was as com∣pleat as ever. No succours had been thrown in, and admiral Stevens in order to prevent the ill impression which the late disaster might have occasioned, sent a message to the neighbouring Dutch and Danish set∣tlements, of the good condition and strength of the remainder of his fleet, and assured them he would make prize of such vessels as he found infringing the neutrality by attempting to supply the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="270"/>
Notwithstanding this mortifying disappointment, M. Lally made no proposal to surrender. The siege was carried on with redoubled ala∣crity; and at length a large battery being advanced within four hundred and fifty yards of the rampart, a breach being effected, and not more than one day's provision of any kind remaining, a signal was made for a cessation; the principal of the Je∣suits, together with two civilians came out, and offered terms of ca∣pitulation. The governor preserv∣ing all his haughtiness, which nei∣ther his errors nor misfortunes could in the least abate, declined to offer any terms; he sent out a paper full of invec∣tives <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15th.</NOTE> against the English, for the breach of treaties relative to India; he alledged that those breaches dis∣qualified him from proposing any terms; and in consequence he ra∣ther suffered our troops to take pos∣session of the place, than formally surrendered it. As the governor re∣fused to capitulate, the proposal of the inhabitants was little regarded, and the city of Pondicherry, with a garrison of about fourteen hundred European soldiers, a vast quantity of military stores, and great riches; was given up at discretion to our victorious arms.</P>
<P>Nothing can be said too highly of the conduct, perseverance, and unanimity of the land and sea ser∣vices during a tedious siege and blockade of eight months, in a climate so unfavourable to all mili∣tary operations. Colonel Coote gave the final blow to the French power in India; he was now undis∣puted master of the rich coast of Coromandel; the French power was wholly extirpated; the neutral na∣tions were contemptible; the prin∣ces of the country considered us with an aweful regard, and nothing but a little French settlement on the coast of Malabar, called Mahie, (and which was soon after reduced) opposed our commanding the whole trade of the vast peninsula of India from the Ganges to the Indies, the most extensive and profitable sphere of commerce in the world.</P>
<P>Whilst every thing was giving way to our arms in the southern parts of this peninsula, the affairs of France, which in Bengal had been to all appearance totally sup∣pressed, rose up again for a mo∣ment from a quarter, and in a manner, which was little expected. After the taking of Chandenagore by admiral Watson in the year 1757, Mr. Law, (nephew to that Law who had made himself so well known by the Missisippi Scheme) put himself at the head of a party of French fugitives, which was augmented from time to time to about two hundred men. With this small party he threw himself into the heart of the country, and joining himself sometimes to one, sometimes to another of the na∣tive princes, as his interest led him; he rendered himself consider∣able by several striking services, and supported the credit of his little corps with a very high reputation.</P>
<P>The Great Mogul having some time since been deposed by an ir∣ruption of the Marattas, and dying soon after, one of his sons, Sha Zaddah, assumed the title, and was supported by some of the provinces of that extensive and disunited em∣pire; he was opposed by others; and though he was at the head of a royal army of his native subjects, such is the state of the military in that part of the world, that he con∣sidered
<PB N="253" REF="271"/>
an handful of European fu∣gitives, as an acquisition of the greatest importance, and such as might turn the ballance against any weight of Indians, which might be thrown into the opposite scale. In fact, it was to Mr. Law he at∣tributed the reduction of several considerable provinces to his obe∣dience.</P>
<P>Elated with these successes, Law persuaded him to turn his arms against Bengal, which had not ac∣knowledged him; it was a rich and flourishing country, and the pos∣session of it, would undoubtedly contribute more than all the rest to set him on the throne of the Mo∣guls. Here, unfortunately for him the evil genius of Law impelled him to encounter again with those arms, by which the interest of his country had been before ruined in this part of the world, and which indeed were those only, from which he had a great deal to fear. Sha Zaddah entered the kingdom of Bengal at the head of an army of 80,000 In∣dians, and something more than 200 French.</P>
<P>The French support was more prejudicial to his title in the eyes of the English, than any other ob∣jection, and as they were now be∣come the arbiters of crowns in the East, they joined the Nabob of Bengal to oppose his progress. About 20,000 blacks supported by 500 English soldiers, formed the army against him. A major (major Carnac) commanded that body, which engaged, and totally routed an army of fourscore thousand men, commanded by the Mogul in per∣son. That prince was taken pri∣soner; Mr, Law was also taken, and the party of French adven∣tures dispersed for ever. It is not yet known with certainty, in what manner they mean to dispose of their captive monarch. It was some heightening to the satisfaction of this great event, that it happen∣ed on the same day in which the French agreed to the surrender of Pondicherry.</P>
<P>A little before this, Jaffier Ali Cawn, the Nabob who, in 1757, had been placed in that dignity by general Clive, notwithstanding the terrifying example of his predeces∣sor, by his weakness and mis∣government, drew on himself the hatred of his subjects, and lost the protection of the English. But as his ambition was the feeblest of his passions, he consented quietly to quit the throne. The revolution was effected without bloodshed, his son∣in-law was appointed in his room; and as the whole transaction was with the consent and co-operation of the English governor Vansittart, the old privileges of the company were confirmed, and new were ac∣quired: the English in Bengal were become necessary to the government of that country, and every change produces something to their advan∣tage.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the period of this war in the East Indies, has been marked by as many striking events, uncommon circumstances, and singular reverses of fortune, as any that have happened from the time of our knowledge of this part of the world. We are sorry that the accounts we have hitherto had are so broken and imperfect, that it is impossible to treat of them in a manner in the least suitable to their dignity and importance. Here we only touch them slightly.</P>
<P>It can hardly be said, that this series of prosperity was interrupted
<PB N="254" REF="272"/>
by the successful attempts of the count d'Estaign. This lively ad∣venturer, with the command of no more than two ordinary frigates, had in October 1759, taken and destroyed the English settlement of Bender-Abassi, on the Persiangulph; he then struck over to the island of Sumatra, where we carry on our most considerable commerce in pep∣per; and before the end of the fol∣lowing April, reduced Bencoolen, the principal settlement, and all the rest of our forts and factories on that island, which made a defence altogether as unworthy of the rest of our conduct in India, as that of the count d'Estaign was superior to the efforts of his countrymen in that quarter. This bold adventurer, however, could not derive so much honour from the vigour of his en∣terprize, as disgrace from having made them against the most sacred law of arms: if what is said is true, that he was at the very time a prisoner upon parole.</P>
<P>In America the island of Domi∣nica, one of those islands called Neutral, but which the French had fortified and settled, was reduced by a small armament under lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas. North America was perfectly quiet∣ed by a peace with the Cherokees. Colonel Grant reduced them to this necessity, by penetrating with great courage and perseverance into their country, and destroying fifteen of their towns, and almost their whole harvest.</P>
