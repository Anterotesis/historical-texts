<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>HYPPOLITUS had no
power to interrupt the painter's
harangue; the emotions of his
soul were such as scarce allowed
him to credit the truth of what
he heard. At length, with a
deep sigh, if your fidelity is to be
depended upon, said he to the
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
painter, and you will engage to
do me a material piece of ser∣vice,
you shall have no reason
to repent your walk:—I am
grateful, and my fortune enables
me to reward my friends;—but I
must insist on the promise of in∣violable
secresy. The painter
concluding he would have him
to take a likeness of some lady
at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> who had captivated
his heart, answered, not a day
passed without putting his fide∣lity
to the proof! and no person
had ever reason to complain on
that article.—He assured him
his conception was so lively and
retentive, that only seeing a face
once, he would engage to trace
every line in it;—or even should
that be impossible, his imagina∣tion
could catch the fatures by
description, so accurately as to
give a very strong resemblance!
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> could not forbear smi∣ling
at the painter's opinion of
the extent of his genius. The
business in agitation, he replied,
has no relation to your skill as
an artist, but to your inclination
to take me with you to St. <HI>Me∣noux,</HI>
a difficulty that does not
appear insurmountable, as I am
totally unknown there, and am
qualified from my knowledge in
design to acquit myself without
any embarasment. You have
only to say I am of <HI>Italy;</HI>—agree
to work for the abbess on her
own terms;—give yourself no
farther trouble, but leave the rest
to me.—The painter was unwil∣ling
to refuse an advantageous
proposal that gratified his avarice
without any dangerous conse∣quences,
as far at least as he could
perceive.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
THE scheme was no sooner
planned than executed.—They
set out in a coach for the abbey
that afternoon, as <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
could not yet bear the motion of
a horse. He left▪ his servants at
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> and changed his cloaths
for a suit no way remarkable, as∣suming
the name of Signior <HI>Je∣ronymo.</HI></P>
<P>No time was lost upon the
road;—he ordered the coach∣man
to drive with all possible
expedition.—<HI>Cupid</HI> was his pos∣tillion,
who added wings to his
horses.—Yet <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
seized with such a tremor when
they alighted, as rendered him
almost incapable of entering the
parlour▪ where the abbess came
to speak to the painter. She en∣quired
who his companion was,
which was natural enough, for
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
inspite of the studied simplicity
of his dress and manners, there
was a gracefulness of mein,—
a symmetry of features,—with
the most engaging expression of
countenance,—that at first sight
struck every beholder with awe
and admiration.—The painter
coldly replied an <HI>Italian,</HI> who
was very fond of the art, and had
worked with him some time.—
The abbess told him she had a
mind he should draw her pic∣ture,
and would sit the next
day;—assuring him she had
employment enough for them
both for a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>THERE required a communi∣cation
so agreeable to comfort
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> under the disappoint∣ment
of not seeing <HI>Julia.</HI> He
rose the next morning before
day-break, and insisted on
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
the painter's doing the same;
—an impatience which did
not appear to him extraordi∣nary,
as he was convinced
his patron had some very impor∣tant
reasons for coming to St.
<HI>Menoux.</HI> The abbess had no
sooner breakfasted than she sent
for them into the convent.—
The eyes of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> searched
in vain for <HI>Julia.</HI> His impetu∣osity
tempted him to fly through
every appartment to find her, and
his heart suffered the most cruel
agitation from the necessity he
was under of concealing it from
the eye of observation. He ever
feared the effect his unexpected
presence might have on <HI>Julia,</HI>
and lest her unguarded transports
should betray the secret. When
they were retired into the cabi∣net,
the abbess seated herself in
the attitude she thought most be∣coming;
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
and <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> to give
himself the appearance of em∣ployment,
began to grind and
mix the colours—It is true,
he performed this task rather
aukwardly, for want of knowing
the exact rules; to seem occu∣pied
was sufficient. Alas! how
did his thoughts wander! and
how tedious were the hours of
expectation! As the ceremony of
sitting to a painter has something
formally tedious in it, the abbess
began to loose that air of chear∣fulness
which she fancied essen∣tial
to the beauty of her portrait.
I have heard, said she, painters
generally abound in entertaining
anecdotes, and tales that relax
the features of the face they are
drawing. But you have not said
a word to divert my imagination,
and I feel myself growing horrid∣ly
serious, for want of some a∣musing
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
recital: I am too much
engrossed, madam, said <HI>Cardini,</HI>
which was the name of the pain∣ter,
with catching a pleasing
likeness, and expressing it pro∣perly,
to think of any subject of
amusement, nor indeed have I
liveliness of fancy to shine in
conversation, but here is <HI>Jero∣nymo,</HI>
whom I keep purposely to
divert the ladies with a thousand
pleasant narratives, that he is
furnished with, if you will give
him leave to address you, I dare
say, madam, you will not repent
the condescension. Begin <HI>Je∣ronymo,</HI>
said the abbess, with an
encouraging look, since <HI>Cardini</HI>
appoints you his deputy. <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
blushed at this malicious
turn of the painter's, and was so
little disposed for conversation,
that he could only answer with
hesitation and reserve, he did not
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
immediately recollect any thing
that wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld entertain her. The
abbess redoubled her entreaties in
a manner so pressing, he feared
to incur her displeasure by an
obstinate silence, which might
banish him for ever from the
place that contained the dear ob∣ject
of his vows. Exerting all
his presence of mind, he endea∣voured
to recollect the particulars
of a <HI>Fairy Tale</HI> he had some∣where
read, and which he re∣peated
in the most graceful ac∣cent.</P>
<P>RUSSIA is situated in a cli∣mate
that excludes its inhabitants
from the free enjoyment of those
delightful days common in tem∣perate
regions. The mountains
are covered with perpepetual
snow, and the trees so incrusted
with icicles, that when the sun
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
glitters on their tops, they ap∣pear
to the eye immense forests
of crystal. The roaring of bears
is so horrible, and to hunt these
formidable animals is regarded
by the natives as the most noble
and honourable occupation.—
This country was in former ages
governed by a young king, named
<HI>Adolphus,</HI> whose happy natural
disposition, beauty, politeness,
and understanding, were so su∣perior
to the rest of his country∣men,
that it was scarce credible
so accomplished a prince should
be born in so rude and unculti∣vated
a soil. He had not seen
twenty years when he was obliged
to support a powerful attack from
a neighbouring kingdom, where
he gave proofs of intrepidity and
conduct. Though he suffered
his troops to repose after the fa∣tigues
of a campaign, he refused
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
to allow himself the same indul∣gence;
but pursued with avidity
the dangerous hunting of the
bear. One day he was pursuing
this diversion with a splendid re∣tinue
of courtiers, he was so
transported with ardour for the
chace, that springing forward in∣to
the midst of the forest, he left
all his attendants at a distance;
and the road dividing different
ways, was soon lost: foreseeing
his error too late,—night ap∣proached;
—the clouds threa∣tened
an impending storm. spur∣ring
his horse till he gained a
large opening in the wood, he
sounded his horn, in hopes it
might reach the ears of the hunt∣ers,
but in vain! The faint
gleam of day that remained, sud∣denly
became more dark than
midnight, objects were only dis∣cernable
by flashes of lightening,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
whilst the roaring of the thunder
and a violent torrent of hail and
rain, added to the horror of the
scene.—The king endeavoured
to find shelter under some large
pines, but was forced to quit
his retreat to avoid the inunda∣tion,
both above and below;
seeking safety from this dreadful
tempest, he with great fatigue
and labour gained the open field,
but found himself still more ex∣posed
to the fury of the storm;
casting his eyes on every side, he
at length saw a light from a dis∣tant
eminence,—turning his
feet that way, he with infinite
pains arrived at the foot of an
almost inaccessible mount, whose
broken fragments formed num∣berless
precipices in the ascent.
Leading his horse sometimes, at
others mounting him, after more
than two hours toil he approached
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
the mouth of a large cavern,
from whence the light issued that
had encouraged his pursuit: he
hesitated a little before he pro∣ceeded
farther, apprehending this
to be the retreat of some notori∣ous
robbers who then ravaged
the country, and might rob and
murther him without danger of
discovery. But as the hearts of
monarchs are composed of par∣ticles
more magnanimous and un∣daunted
than those of common
mortals, he reproached himself
for his timidity, and entered the
cavern, his hand upon his sword,
determined to defend his life in
case of an attack. The chill∣ness
of the cavern almost froze
his blood.</P>
<P>THE noise he made brought
a female, whose grey hair and
wrinkled visage; spoke her far
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
vanced in years, from the hollow
of the rock. She testified the
greatest astonishment, in accost∣ing
him:—you are, said she, the
first mortal I ever beheld in this
place!—Do you know, my
lord, to whom it appertains?—
Indeed, my good woman, I am
totally ignorant. It is, pursued
she, the cavern of <HI>Aelous,</HI> god of
the winds.—Here he retires
with his numerous progeny, I
am their mother, and you find
me alone, because they are every
one employed in his separate de∣partment
to dispense blessings or
misfortunes in the world, accord∣ing
to the will of <HI>Jove.</HI> But she
continued, you seem drenched
with rain: I will instantly kindle
a fire to dry you. What troubles
me is, that you will find but bad
entertainment.—The winds
make light repasts:—men have
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
occasion for more substantial ali∣ments.</P>
<P>THE king thanked her for so
hospitable a reception, drawing
near the fire which was lighted
in a moment, by the breath of a
western gale, who preceded his
brethren the <HI>North East,</HI> and se∣veral
of the northern blasts: <HI>Ae∣lous</HI>
soon appeared, attended by
<HI>Boreas, Auster, Eaurus,</HI> &amp;c. all
dripping wet;—their cheeks
swelled;—their hair disorder∣ed;
—their manners rough and
boisterous; and when they spoke,
the prince was almost chilled
with their breath.—One re∣counted
his dispersing of a naval
armament;—another, the ma∣ny
vessels he had sunk;—a third,
the care he had taken to preserve
a fleet of merchant-ships from
falling into the hands of the <HI>Cor∣sairs.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
—Several speaking at once
of rooting up trees, overtunring
buildings and walls;—each
vaunting his own exploits.—
The old woman listened to their
tales.—but, on a sudden she dis∣covered
the utmost inquietude:
—you bring no tidings of
my son <HI>Zephyrus?</HI>—It is
late, and I confess my anxiety
that he is not returned?—All
declared they had seen nothing
of their brother.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Adolphus</HI> perceived at
the entrance of the cavern a young
boy, beautiful as <HI>Love</HI> is painted!
The white plumage of his wings
shaded with the blush of roses,
was so transparently delicate, as
to be agitated by the flightest
breeze.—His fair hair flowed
in graceful ringlets over his shoul∣ders,
negligently charming.—
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
His bow was was encircled with
a garland of jassamine and roses;
—his air, smiling, sportive
and delightful!</P>
<P>WHERE have you been, little
libertine, cried the old woman,
in a mingled tone of joy and an∣ger;
—all your brothers are
here before you!—You, alone,
pursue the dictates of a roving
fancy, regardless of the pangs
you make me suffer.—My dear
mother, replied <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> I was
sorry to stay out so late, because I
feared you would take it ill;—
but I have been paying a visit to
the Princess <HI>Felicia.</HI>—I found
her walking in her garden, sur∣rounded
by her nymphs.—One
formed a wreath of flowers for
her hair, another reclined upon
a mossy carpet modestly uncover∣ed
part of her neck, to leave me
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
the liberty of stealing a kiss;—
some danced in parties;—o∣thers
sung to the melody of flutes
—The fairest princess in the
world was in a grove of orange
trees;—my breath fanned the
sunbeams from her lips, playing
at thousand sportive gambols
round her, and pertly lifting up
her snowy veil.—<HI>Zephyr,</HI> said
she, in the sweetest voice ima∣ginable,
—how agreeably re∣freshing
I find thee!—What
pleasure thou givest me! so long
as thou art present, I shall con∣tinue
to walk.—I confess these
flattering expressions from a
mouth so charming, quite en∣chanted
me, and I was so little
master of myself, that I could
never have summoned a resolu∣tion
to leave her, but from the
apprehension of your displeasure.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
ADOLPHUS hearkened to this
recital with such extreme satis∣faction,
that he regetted its be∣ing
finished. Permit me ami∣able
youth, said he, to ask in
what country the princess reigns
of whom you have been speak∣ing?
In the island of <HI>Felicity,</HI>
my lord, answered <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> a
country inaccessible to mortals.
—Crouds are ever in search
of it; but such is the lot of hu∣manity,
they never yet could
find it.—They make fruitless
voyages round the coast, nay,
sometimes flatter themselves with
having gained the port of <HI>Felicity,</HI>
when driven by the tempests in∣to
some small bay, or creak,
they enjoy a short interval of
calm repose!—I have known
several persons desirous to fix
their abode in those little isles
that encircle the great one, and
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
are infinitely inferior in beauty;
but these are floating, and soon
vanish from the sight;—and that
restless inquietude which will
not suffer mortals long to enjoy,
ever the shadows of tranquillity,
impells them again into the o∣cean,
where I every day see men
of distinguished merit perish.—
The king asked several other
questions, which <HI>Zephyrus</HI> ans∣wered
with great veracity and
good sense.</P>
<P>IT was extremely late, and
their caresul mother commanded
her childred to retire to their
cells.—<HI>Zephyrus</HI> offered the
king part of his little bed; which
was more commodiously situated
and warmer than the other con∣cavities
in the rock. The bed
was of turf, sprinkled with aro∣matic
flowers. <HI>Adolphus</HI> threw
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
himself by the side of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI>
not to sleeps but to interrupt
him still farther about the prin∣cess
<HI>Felicia:</HI> how you inflame
my curiosity to see this transcen∣dant
beauty! said he to <HI>Zephy∣rus.</HI>
—Is it a thing so absolutely
impossible, that with your assis∣tance
it cannot be obtained?—
<HI>Zephyrus</HI> represented the ama∣zing
danger of the enterprize;
but at length told him if he had
courage enough to trust such a
conveyance, he thought he could
contrive to bear him on his
wings through the aerial regions
to this land of <HI>Felicity.</HI> I will
give you a mantle, which, when
you turn the green side outward,
will render you invisible, which
is a very necessary precaution to
preserve you from terrible mon∣sters
that guard the island; who,
should they discern you, brave
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
as you are! your life may fall a
sacrifice, or, fascinated by their
power;—existence be considered
as a curse. <HI>Adolphus</HI> was so ea∣ger
to undertake this perilous
adventure,—that indifferent to
and fearless of danger, he ac∣cordingly
accepted the offer of
<HI>Zephyrus.</HI></P>
<P>SCARCELY had <HI>Aurora</HI> in her
pearly car, with rosy finger, un∣barred
the gates of <HI>Heaven,</HI> when
the impatient monarch of <HI>Russia</HI>
waked his friend <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> who
was a little drowsy: I don't suf∣fer
you to take any rest, said he,
embracing him, but, my gene∣rous
host, it seems time for us
to begin our journey. Let us a∣way
this instant, my prince, said
<HI>Zephyrus,</HI> so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar from complain∣ing
of your disturbing me, I am
to thank you.—For, to let you
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
into a secret, I am in love with
a rose, who is high spirited and
capricious;—and I should have
a violent lecture if I fail paying
my devoirs before sunrise. She
blows in one of the Princess <HI>Fe∣licia's</HI>
parterres.—So saying, he
presented the mantle to the king,
and made an effort to take him
upon his wings, but not find∣ing
it altogether convenient,—
I will raise you in the air as I did
<HI>Psyche,</HI> said <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> when by
the command of <HI>Cupid</HI> I con∣veyed
her to the magnificent pa∣lace
he had built for her recep∣tion?
lifting him in his arms,
and balancing upon the point of
the rock, he extended his wings
and mounted into the air with
astonishing velocity.—Notwith∣standing
the intrepidity of the
king of <HI>Russia,</HI> he was not
void of apprehensions at finding
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
himself suspended in the arms of
a stripling, from so immensura∣ble
a height.—The reflection
that this stripling was a god, re∣assured
him, and the considera∣tion
that <HI>Cupid,</HI> though a feeble
child in appearance, is the most
formidable and irresistable of all
the gods, by degrees banished
his terrors.</P>
<P>RESIGNED to destiny, he be∣gan
to recover his vivacity, and
to be attentive to the parts of the
world he hovered over. But
these were too innumerable for
description:—cities, kingdoms,
rivers, seas, empires, and desarts,
forests and continents, yet un∣known,
passed in succession be∣fore
his admiring eyes, and de∣prived
him of utterance from the
astonishment he felt.—<HI>Zephyrus</HI>
informed him of the names, cus∣toms,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
and manners of all the
different inhabitants of the globe.
—They rested on the tremen∣dous
mounts <HI>Cavcasus, Athos,</HI>
and several others on their road.
Though the fair rose I adore
should wound me with her thorns,
said <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> I cannot suffer you
to traverfe so great a space with∣out
allowing you a few minutes
to contemplate the wonders of
nature.</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS expressed the high∣est
gratitude for his friend's com∣plaisance,
and at the same time
fear lest the Princess <HI>Felicia</HI>
should not understand the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
language;—or that he should
be ignorant of her's. Be in no con∣cern
on that account, said <HI>Zephy∣rus,</HI>
the princess's erudition is uni∣versal;
and I am persuaded, you
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
will both speak the same lan∣guage
in a very short time!</P>
<P>THEIR flight was so rapid
that the much-desired island was
soon in view;—which, from
its collective beauties, the king
was easily convinced to be the
work of enchantment: the air
was odoriferous;—the dew
fell in drops of exquisite perfume
and the rains in showers scented
with orange flowers:—foun∣tains
and cascades that seemed
to touch the clouds: groves and
pastures of a verdure and bloom
unknown in other countries:—
rivulets, whose transparent bloom
shone more bright than crystal,
murmuring in delightful mea∣dows:
—concerts of birds whose
musick was more melifluous than
those of the greatest masters:—
fruits, the delicious product of
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
spontaneous nature:—tables fur∣nished
with the most exquisite
delicacies to gratify the taste of
epicurism.—But the palace sur∣passed
all that imagination can
form, of walls of diamonds:—
floors and ceilings inlaid in com∣partments
of precious stones.—
Here gold was more common
than pebbles:—the fountain
was made, and fancied <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by
those fairies who were the cri∣terions
of taste, with such
regard to propriety, that no one
could determine which was most
to be admired, the elegance or
grandeur of this superb edifice.</P>
<P>ZEPHYRUS placed the king
on a pleasant lawn. Sir, said
he, I have performed my en∣gagement;
the rest must be left
to you.—They embraced.—
<HI>Adolphus</HI> expressed the most grate∣ful
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
acknowledgment of his
friendship; and the littlegod,
impatient to visit his rose, left
him to explore the beauties of
these delicious gardens, to wan∣der
in shady walks, or repose in
grottoes, calculated for pleasure.
—In one of those he was struck
with a <HI>Cupid</HI> in white marble.
whose symetry and expression,
demonstrated it a capital perfor∣mance
of some excellent sculp∣tor.
His altar, instead of flames,
spouted rereshing streams of wa∣ter.
He leaned against a rock of
shell work, and seemed to read
the following lines engraved on a
marble tablat:</P>
<P>“WHOEVER is ignorant of
the pleasures of love, has ne∣ver
tasted real happiness.—
That alone satisfies the extent
of our wishes,—and renders
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
life desireable. Without love
wealth and ambition grow
languid and insipid the heart
is unoccupied!”</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS at length entered
a woodbine bower, whose invi∣ting
obscurity was impenetrable
to the sunbeams; throwing him∣self
on the grassy margin of a
fountain, he suffered sleep to
recruit his weary limbs and hea∣vy
eylids, with some hours of
repose.</P>
<P>IT was midday when he a∣waked;
vexed at the time he
had lost, he advanced hastily to∣wards
the palace,—and admired
the style of architecture with at∣tentive
observation, where all
the arts equally combined to es∣tablish
a model of perfection.—
The king wore his mantle, the
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
green side outward, so that he
could examine every thing, un∣perceived;
but whether the gates
through the vestibule were closed
or that the approach to the pa∣lace
was in the opposite front,
he essayed in vain to find an en∣trance;
when he saw a fair hand
open a crystal window.—At
this signal, a young nymph, who
was at work in the garden, run
to receive a large shell of gold
filagrie, tied with knots of rib∣bands,
which she was ordered to
fill with flowers for the prin∣cess;
this she no sooner had se∣lected,
than <HI>Adolphus</HI> transported
himself with them into the shell.
It must be presumed the mantle
that conferred invisibility, be∣stowed
also a proportionable de∣gree
of levity, otherwise it would
be difficult to account for the
ease with which he was drawn
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
up to the window, where he ar∣rived
without the least accident.
He sprung out of the shell into
the midst of a noble saloon,
where he saw and heard things
marvelous to relate.—The
nymphs were divided into par∣ties,
none seemed above eighteen
years of age; and many much
younger. The beauties of the
fair and brown were blended in
the most exquisite perfection; so
that every nymph singly, might
be deemed completely handsome.</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS would have re∣mained
facinated with admira∣tion,
if the sweetness of female
voices according to the melody
of musical instruments as, judici∣ously
touched, had not excited
his curiosity. He moved to∣wards
the appartment from
whence the delightful harmony
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
proceeded, and though he ap∣prehended
the beauties of the la∣dies
on the saloon, could not be
exceeded, he felt a peculiar plea∣sure
in being convinced of his
mistake; but what was his a∣mazement
to find, that by a kind
of intuition, he understood the
meaning of every song, though
the language was new to his ear!
listening enraptured, to one of
the prettiest nymphs, her veil fell
off, when, not considering how
much it must alarm her, he took
it from the ground and presented
it—Seeing the veil apparently
move,—she screamed! and, per∣haps
this was the first emotion
of fear, ever experienced in this
island of <HI>Felicity.</HI> Her com∣panions
assembled round her, ask∣ing
the cause of this unusual
sound.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
You will think me strangely
whimsical, said she, when I tell
you I dropped my vell, and re∣ceived
it again from an invisible
hand. They laughed exceed∣ingly
at the oddity of the fancy,
and run into the appartment of
the princess to divert her with the
tale.</P>
<P>ADOLPUS followed, by favour
of the green mantle, through
halls, galleries, and chambers
innumerable, till he entered the
appartment of the sovereign,—
seated on a throne, composed of
a single carbuncle, brighter than
the sun, The eyes of the prin∣cess
<HI>Felicia</HI> shot forth rays still
more bright than the carbuncle!
The bloom of celestial youth
and beauty, glowed on her cheek;
—animated her whole person and
air▪—accompanied with that
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
graceful majesty, and sensible vi∣vacity
calculated to inspire ado∣ration
and reverence.—Her dress
seemed more the result of ele∣gance
than magnificence.—Her
fair hair was carelessly adorned
with flowers.—She had on a
loose robe of gold and white
gauze,—with a pale purple
veil;—several little cupids wan∣toned
round her, playing a thou∣sand
sportive fooleries to amuse
her;—some kissed her hands,
—others assisted their com∣panions
to mount the sides of the
throne, and place a diamond of
pearl on her head.—The <HI>plea∣sures</HI>
and <HI>graces</HI> were her con∣stant
attendants.</P>
<P>IN short, all that mortals can
conceive of paradise, is faint to
what the king of <HI>Russia</HI> saw re∣alized.
—Dazzled with the splen∣dor
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
of those immortal charms, to
which he already found his heart
devoted, he remained in an extasiy
of wonder that rivetted his feet,
and agitated his spirits so ex∣tremely,
that forgetting all things
but the object of his adoration,—
he let the green mantle fall.—
The princess started with surprize.
She had never seen a man.</P>
<P>ADOLPHUS, sensible he was
discovered, fell at her feet, and
regarding her with the profound∣est
respect,—Great princess, he
began, I have traversed the aerial
regions to admire your divine
beauty;—to offer you my vows;
—to entreat your acceptance of
the most constant of all hearts.
—Though <HI>Felicia</HI> had an un∣common
share of wit and vivaci∣ty,
she continued silent and dis∣concerted.
—Never had she be∣held
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
a creature that appeared
more amiable in her eyes! than
what she contemplated as a sin∣gular
production of nature; a
thought that led her to believe
this might be the phoenix, so
renowned for superlative beauty▪
—This error occasioned her to
address him thus:</P>
<P>FAIR phoenix, for your beau∣ty
convinces me that must be
your true appellation, as there
is nothing in my island half so
charming. I am delighted at the
compliment you pay me, and
cannot help regretting you are
the only one of your species.—
What a glorious appearance
would a flight of such birds as
you make, all mounted on the
wing! <HI>Adolphus</HI> could not for∣bear
smiling at the simplicity of
the idea; but unwilling a person
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
for whom he had conceived a vi∣olent
passion, should remain any
longer in a state of ignorance,
that was in some degree a re∣flection
on her understanding, he
instantly informed her of the
particulars of his rank in the
scale of beings: and never was
mind more apprehensive of all
the truths he wished to inform
her. Her exquisite penetration
and discernment run even before
the master's instruction.</P>
<P>A PERFECT similarity of sen∣timent
soon produced that mu∣tual
happiness which arrises from
loving another better than ones
self. All that there is of sweet∣ness
in the most fond and disin∣terested
attachment;—all that
the most brilliant and fertile i∣magination
can conceive;—all
that the most delicate and sus∣ceptible
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
heart can feel, did these
faithful lovers enjoy pure and
uninterrupted;—repose undis∣turbed;
—pleasures fresh-spring∣ing;
—health unimpaired;—
strangers even to the slightest
disappointment or inconvenience;
—perpetual youth ever crowned
their days.—In this delicious
retreat, they drank copious
draughts of the fountain of <HI>de∣light;</HI>
—no doubts, no jealous
suspicions, even those frivolous
disputes that sometimes interrupt
the tranquillity of the sincerest
lovers, and are succeeded by the
sweet joy of reconciliation, were
here unknown; entertained in
the bosom of pleasure, till that
hour no mortal but the king of
<HI>Russia</HI> ever experienced happiness
unallayed. Fatal lot of huma∣nity,
—that bears within its own
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
bosom the destruction of its fe∣licity!</P>
<P>IT came into the head of <HI>A∣dolphus</HI>
one day, to ask the prin∣cess
how long he had been in
the island; the hours pass so a∣greeably
in your society, said he,
that I have never once reflected
on the subject. I will answer
your question, said <HI>Felicia,</HI> but
first let me hear your own con∣jecture?
He began to ruminate,
—Were I only to consult my
heart and the satisfaction I ex∣perience,
I should not apprehend
it could be more than a week;
but, my dear princess, several
circumstances I now recollect,
convince me I must have been
with you very near three months.
The princess laughed excessively.
—Know then, <HI>Adolphus,</HI> said
she, with a more serious air, three
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
hundred years are past since you
landed upon this island. Ah,
could she have foreseen the ef∣fect
of the discovery, she would
never have made it!—Three
hundred years! Good <HI>God!</HI> ex∣claimed
the king. Is the ba∣lance
of power preserved?—
Who are the present monarchs
of the globe? What are their
political systems? I shall then
revisit the earth unknowing and
unknown! My kingdom is un∣doubtedly,
no longer in the pos∣session
of my family! I dare
not flatter myself that they enjoy
an acre of ground!—A king
without dominions!—Every
one will regard me as a phan∣tom!
ignorant of the manners
and customs of my own people!</P>
<P>THE princess could no longer
restrain her impatience to inter∣rupt
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
these exclamations.—<HI>Adol∣phus,</HI>
said she, is this the reward
of that profusion of love;—that
lavish distribution of blessings
my fondness has bestowed? I
received you into my palace;—
you are the master of it;—I have
preserved your life during three
centuries in the bloom of youth;
—nor have you ever, till this
fatal moment, known a painful
sensation.—How many must you
have experienced in the world?</P>
<P>I HAVE not an ungrateful
heart, fair princess, replied <HI>A∣dolphus,</HI>
with some confusion, I
am thoroughly sensible of all
the obligations I owe you.—It
is not perhaps too late to perform
some great actions that may pur∣chase
immortal fame.—With
shame I contemplate my inactive
virtue.—My name buried in
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
oblivion. Such was the brave
<HI>Reinaldo</HI> in the arms of <HI>Armida.</HI>
—But the voice of glory tore
him from her allurements.—
Glory will have the same influ∣ence
on thee <HI>Barbarian!</HI> cried
the princess, shedding a flood of
tears, thou wilt abandon me!—
Thou wilt render thyself unwor∣thy
of the grief that overwhelms
me.—Here she fainted.—The
king was sensibly affected.—He
loved her with extreme ardour;
—but his heart reproached him
for lavishing so many years in
the bosom of love and indolence,
without one gallant enterprize
to distinguish him in the rank of
heroes.</P>
<P>IN vain he essayed to restrain
his indignation, and conceal the
anguish of his soul.—Oppressed
with a constant langour that
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
wasted the beauty of his form,
<HI>Adolphus</HI> could scarce be recog∣nized.
—He with whom ages
were no more than months, now
considered months as ages.—The
princess saw the amazing change
with inexpressible concern. She
could not bear to be indebt∣ed
to complaisance alone for
the society of the man she loved
disinterestedly tender.—She
informed him he was not to
consider himself as a prisoner,
—he might depart whenever he
pleased.—But she could not con∣ceal
her apprehensions that some
signal misfortune would attend
him!</P>
<P>THESE last words were inca∣pable
of interrupting the joy
he received from the first;—
and though his heart experi∣enced
some distressful emotions
at the necessity of a separation.
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
Yet the caprice of destiny impel∣led
him to persist in bidding a∣dieu
to the generous object of his
admiration, by whom he was
alas so tenderly beloved!—His
parting vows assured her that, as
soon as he had complied with
the dictates of honour, and ren∣dered
himself more worthy of her
esteem he should be a stranger
to repose till he could return to
pay his dutiful acknowledgments
to the only sovereign of his heart,
the only blessing that made life
desirable.—Natural elocution
supplied the language of love,
but <HI>Felicia</HI> was too penetrating
to be imposed upon; a fatal pre∣sentiment
informed her a few
moments would deprive her for
ever of the dear idol of her af∣fection.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47"/>
THE more violent her efforts
to restrain her swelling grief, the
more exquisite were her suffer∣ings.
She presented her now
cold and indifferent lover with
the most magnificent armour,
and the finest courser he had ever
beheld:—<HI>Bichac,</HI> which is the
name of the horse I give you,
will conduct you, said the prin∣cess,
to the fields of glory to
fight and conquer your enemies.
—But I beseech you, <HI>Adol∣phus,</HI>
not to dismount till you
arrive in your own territories,
for, by the prescience of a fairy,
bestowed on me by the <HI>Gods,</HI> I
discover, that if you neglect to
follow my advice, it will not be
in the power of <HI>Bichac</HI> to save
you from the danger that threa∣tens.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
THE king promised to obey
her counsel implicitly; kissed
her fair hand a thousand times,
and was so impatient to leave that
paradise of bliss, he actually
forgot his invisible mantle!</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived at the
confines of the island, the vigo∣rous
horse sprung with his mas∣ter
into the ocean, which he
swam across, pursuing his jour∣ney
over mountains and valleys,
plains and forests, with a swift∣ness
that resembled flying more
than any other motion. At
length one evening, passing
through a hollow, narrow lane,
stony, rugged, and edged with
thorns, he saw a cart overturned,
that barred their progress, loaded
with old wings, variously fash∣ioned.
A man bending under
the weight of years, who appear∣ed
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
to be the driver, seemed
crushed beneath the wheels: his
bald head, tremulous voice, and
apparent distress, excited the
compassion of <HI>Adolphus. Bichac</HI>
shewed his disposition to turn
back or leap over the hedge, and
was exerting his agility for that
purpose, when the poor old
wretch cried out, Ah! sir, for
<HI>God's</HI> sake. pity my situation,—
vouchsafe to assist me, or I die?
<HI>Adolphus</HI> could not resist the im∣pulse
he had to save him: he
quitted his horse, eagerly ad∣vancing,
he presented his hand
to raise him from the earth, but
alas! what was his astonishment
to find the no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeble old
man rise with such vigour and
expedition, as to seize him in his
mighty grasp before he could put
himself in a posture of defence.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50"/>
KING of <HI>Russia,</HI> said he, in
the most terribly meaning voice,
at last I have found thee!—
My name is <HI>Time.</HI>—I have sought
thee in vain during three centu∣ries;
and have worn all the wings
with which my cart is loaded, to
stumps in quest of thee, through∣out
the universe; but however
carefully concealed, nothing can
be long hid from my allseeing
eye. He pressed the mouth of
<HI>Adolphus</HI> with his iron hand▪ and
stopping the organs of respira∣tion,
the king fell dead at his
feet.</P>
<P>IN that sad moment <HI>Zephyrus</HI>
passed by, and beheld the fate of
his beloved <HI>Adolphus</HI> with the
most piercing affliction. No
sooner had the old monster left
him, than he strove with the
sweetness of his breath, to reani∣mate
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
the lifeless form.—But
finding his utmost efforts una∣vailing,
he balanced him in his
arms as he had done in happier
days, and weeping bitterly, con∣veyed
him once more to the
island of <HI>Felicity.</HI> He laid him
in a grotto, covering him with
flowers; raised a trophy with
his armour;—and engraved
on a jasper column erected near
his unfortunate friend, these
lines:</P>
<P>“TIME is the conqueror of
all things.—Pleasure ends
in satiety.—Beauty decays
with years.—The mind of
man forms a multiplicity of
desires, fleeting as the passing
gale.—Dissatisfied though en∣circled
with delight.—If
sometimes exulting in the
success of his plans, the sun
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
of contentment brightens his
countenance.—Soon the
clouds of disappointment ga∣ther
on his brow:—he proves
a sad reverse of fortune:—
his sensible love is not eternal,
nor happiness perfect”</P>
<P>IN this grotto the desolate <HI>Fe∣licia</HI>
mourned daily, the depar∣ture
of her ungrateful lover;—
here she encreased the river with
a torrent of tears, What un∣hoped
for joy to find him when the
distance between them appeared
an insurmountable bar! she fan∣cied,
fatigued with so long a
journey, he had fallen asleep;—
hesitating whether to wake him,
and give a loose to the tender
transports of her heart; already
her arms were extended to em∣brace
him,—when drawing
nearer. she perceived with hor∣ror
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
the extent of her misfortune.
Her piercing shrieks were enough
to create compassion in things in∣animate!
She gave instant or∣ders
for the gates of the palace
to be irrevocably shut against all
access: from that fatal period,
no one has been able to boast of
a complete prospect of its archi∣tecture.</P>
<P>HER excess of grief is such as
admits of her being rarely visible.
—And then she is preceded by
cares, attended by anxieties, and
followed by disappointments.—
These are her constant compa∣nions;
as mankind too feelingly
experiences, and since this de∣plorable
catastrophe, is ready to
attest the truth of the maxim,—
“Time devours all things;—
and complete happiness has no
existence on earth.”</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
HYPPOLITUS ceased speak∣ing.
—The abbess assured him
she was convinced of the truth
of his assertion; for that her fear
so agreeable a tale should come
to a conclusion, had interrupted
the pleasure she felt in hearing
It!—She was lavish in enco∣miums
on his manner and turn
of expression, and had not yet
finished her thanks,—when
<HI>Julia's</HI> woman came with her
lady's compliments, who was
then in bed with a violent head∣ach,
and a request that the ab∣bess
would send her some book
to divert her. <HI>Isabella,</HI> said the
abbess, you see I am engaged,
and cannot send her one just now,
but you shall take <HI>Jeronymo</HI> with
you, who will divert her better
than any book in my library.—
He has been telling me the pret∣tiest
tale in the world; and am
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
sure he will be so complaisant as
to repeat it to your lady; entreat∣ing
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to follow the ser∣vant,
who it may be concluded
was not tardy in obeying her
command.—He held his hand∣kerchief
to his face. to prevent
the abbess from observing his ex∣treme
agitation, and lest <HI>Isahella</HI>
should know him through his
disguise, and shew any marks of
amazement.</P>
<P>SHE introduced him into <HI>Julia's</HI>
chamber, where, no longer under
restraint▪ <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> falling on his
knees by the bed unable to speak,
snatched one of her hands, which
he kissed with an extravagance of
joy, that expressed a resolution to
die rather than quit it.—The
curtains were drawn, and the few
rays of light admitted, did not
serve to distinguish <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
whose cheek reclined on the bed.
—<HI>Julia</HI> did not immediately
know him, and used her utmost
efforts to disengage the hand he
had seized. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> mistaking
the motive of this resistance, and
concluding it an indubitable
proof of her aversion, withdrew,
pale, trembling, and over whelm∣ed
with distress.—You abhor
me, <HI>Julia,</HI> said he in the most
tender and affecting accent, you
accuse me as the author of your
misfortunes, and notwithstand∣ing
my innocence, you regard
me with a secret horror that ren∣ders
my presence hateful.</P>
<P>AH! my dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> cried
<HI>Julia,</HI> struck with the well∣known
voice, what wild conjec∣tures
are these? How little do
you know my sentiments! She
held out her no longer reluctant
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
hand, and welcomed him with
expressions of tenderness which
the occasion justified. This fa∣vourable
reception completed
his happiness. Their eyes were
a long time rivelled in silent ex∣tasy,
and were the sole interpre∣ters
of the emotions of their soul.
—Tears of mingled joy and
sorrow succeeded;—but joy
at length reigned triumphant,—
and poured forth the most en∣dearing,
rapturous expressions in
the first moments of speech, for∣getting
every circumstance but
the delightful one of gazing on
each other.—Those who have
felt the severest shafts of fortune,
—who love to desperation,—
whom fraud and violence sepa∣rate,
—whom some lucky chance
unexpectedly unites,—have their
hearts and imaginations so aban∣doned
in mental transports, that
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
language is incapable of explain∣ing
their sentiments:—broken
fighs,—incoherent exclamations
—unfinished sentences,—pro∣claim
the supreme happiness of
being once more together.</P>
<P>THIS reflection reanimates
their passion,—exhausts itself in
vows of everlasting constancy,—
whilst a consecration of hours ap∣pears
but as a single moment.—
This was the very situation of
<HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI>—so that it
would be impossible to give any
connected account of what they
said; but those who are suscep∣tible
of tenderness, and have
been engaged in similar scenes,
will be at no loss to imagine.</P>
<P>No sooner had the abbess
dined, than attended by <HI>Cardini,</HI>
she had her picture carried into
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
the sick lady's appartment to con∣sult
whether the attitude was a∣greeable,
or the drawing cor∣rect.
After criticifing some
time on its defects, can you for∣get
my dear madam, to thank
me, said the abbess, for the pains
I have took in prevailing with
<HI>Jeronymo</HI> to entertain you with
that pretty allegory? You must
acknowledge he has a very lively
fancy, and that the faries them∣selves
could never have composed
a narrative half so delightful!—
<HI>Julia,</HI> not comprehending what
the abbess alluded to, replied, at
hazard, she should not pardon
herself for omitting the proper
compliments, if her thoughts
had not been entirely engrossed
with the pleasure of seeing her.
That if the abbess approved it,
she had a great inclination to learn
to draw, as her melancholy was
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
so extreme, she ought to neglect
nothing to divert it. The ab∣bess
was pleased with the reso∣lution,
and agreed that whilst
<HI>Cardini</HI> was painting in the ca∣binet,
<HI>Jeronymo</HI> should give <HI>Ju∣lia</HI>
lessons, on condition, said she,
that you will sometimes spare
him to tell me stories. <HI>Hyp∣politus</HI>
avoided joining the con∣versation,
but enjoyed the deli∣cious
satisfaction of thinking he
should see his mistress every day,
and in that hope, would not
have changed situations with the
greatest monarch upon earth.</P>
<P>THINGS thus settled, <HI>Hyppo∣litus</HI>
passed three or four hours
every afternoon in <HI>Julia's</HI> ap∣partment.
—He related to her
the particulars of <HI>Lucilla's</HI> mar∣riage
with <HI>Leander,</HI> an event
that gave her extreme pleasure;
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
her regard for that generous
friend was incapable of diminu∣tion,
and she considered <HI>Leander</HI>
not only as a man of uncommon
merit, but as the intimate friend
of her dear <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—The
warmth with which she expres∣sed
her approbation of this agree∣able
alliance, made her lover
desirous to avail himself of what
he thought a favourable conjunc∣ture.
—If you are so sincerely
interested, my dearest <HI>Julia,</HI> in
the happiness of my sister, you
will contribute to its augmenta∣tion,
said he, by confirming
mine.—What objections can
there be to choosing her house
for your retreat;—you will find
the whole family devoted to your
service.—I will attend or fol∣low
you.—There we may con∣verse
uninteruptedly without
perturbation, or dread of disco∣very.
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
Reflect that I must be in
constant danger of discovery in
this place, the consequence of
which is too evident.—Rely up∣on
my opinion, and let me en∣treat
you to consent to make use
of the opportunity fortune offers
to our wishes.—Leave me to
contrive and secure your escape,
and we shall then be at liberty to
take farther measures to redress
your wrongs.</P>
<P>BUT my reputation.—dear
<HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> interrupted <HI>Julia,</HI>
in a melancholy tone, what will
become of that? Think of the
indelible stain it must endure,—
when the world shall report I am
fled with you. Why is my husband
enraged? Why the cruel treat∣ment
I experience from his fury?
—but because he believes you are
dear to me? This is the only
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
plea he can alledge in justifica∣tion
of his severity!—And to
confirm the reality of his suspi∣cions,
to vindicate his conduct,
and degrade mine,—we are to
elope together. Ah! my dear
brother! this is a step I cannot
reconcile to my ideas of proprie∣ty.
—Prudence suggests that I
remain here.</P>
<P>YOU are unwilling, madam,
to do justice either to yourself or
me, replied <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> extreme∣ly
agitated; can the world con∣demn
you for breaking your
chains? For freeing yourself
from a convent where you are
unworthily confined without any
justifiable cause? If prudence
forbids me to accompany you,—
it will suffer me to follow you.
—Is there a sensation more
natural to the human heart than
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
to desire to recover our liberty
when we are deprived of it?—
My dear <HI>Julia,</HI> if ever you have
condescended to regard me with
affection,—if my passion,—
if my constancy has made any
impression,—grant to my tears,
and solicitations what you refuse
to your own desires.</P>
<P>PRESS me no longer,—<HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
replied <HI>Julia,</HI>—I am in
despair you should wish a thing
impossible for me to comply
with.—Surely, if your love was
equal to your protestations, you
would enter more deeply into my
distress, and the regard due to
my character! <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> still
remained at her feet, sighing
bitterly;—a dreadful silence
was succeeded by these exclama∣tions;
—Good <HI>God!</HI> what can I
do more? Cruel woman! deaf
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
to my persuasions.—You are
fond of misery;—you refuse
an asylum that the most rigid
virtue cannot disapprove! Is it
that you regard me with aver∣sion?
No, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
said she, presenting her hand
with a smile of ineffable com∣placency,
no I do not regard you
with aversion! nor can I believe
you have entertained a moment's
doubt of my sentiments. I am
still that very <HI>Julia</HI> who prefer∣red
your repose to her own, who
lives only for you▪ Yet pre∣fers
the laws of virtue, and the
rules that duty prescribes, to the
indulgence of your passion, or
her own;—You tell me I am
so happy in my present state of
confinement, as to be very indif∣ferent
about leaving it. Mis∣taken
man! my soul suffers un∣remitting
alarms, lest you should
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
be discovered, and sink under the
idea of the dreadful consequences!
But, I have a method to pro∣pose,
which will place me in a
situation to receive your visits
without any violation of decency.
We will write to my father in
terms that will bring him hither
immediately; under his sanction
I shall have nothing to fear from
the breath of calumny.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS made unavail∣ing
remonstrances on the length
of the voyage, besides the re∣tardment
that might happen from
a number of unforeseen causes;
<HI>Julia</HI> continued resolute in her
determination; so that as a proof
of his obedience, and in distant
hopes of advancing his own hap∣piness,
he sent a pacquet to his
friend, <HI>Leander,</HI> with injunc∣tions
to forward it to the earl of
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
<HI>Warwick.—Julia</HI> expatiated on
the sufferings a husband had in∣flicted;
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> explained the
lucky chance which discovered
her abode, at a time he had least
reason to expect it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the abbess
was taking useful precautions
with <HI>Cardini,</HI>—informing him it
was of the last consequence, that
neither himself or his assistant
should convey any letters from
the fair stranger; the painter
made use of the strongest asseve∣rations
to assure her he would
either refuse taking them at all,
or if complaisance forbad that, it
should only be to deliver them
to the abbess: he added he could
be answerable for the fidelity of
<HI>Jeronymo,</HI> in whose favour the
abbess was greatly prepossessed,
ever since the tale of the king of
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
<HI>Russia;</HI> so that she had not the
least suspicion of his betraying
her in favour of <HI>Julia.</HI></P>
<P>THE satisfaction of the two
lovers is not to be described.—
They rose every morning with
the certain hope of seeing each
other; and their days glided on
in this smiling desart with more
delightful serenity, than they
could have done in the most
brilliant court under the aus∣pices
of the best of kings.—In∣deed
it is one of the secret charms
of real love, that it destroys am∣bition,
and a thousand cankered
desires which corrode and tyran∣nize
over hearts insusceptible of its
sway. This happy pair mutually
entertained each other with inte∣resting
passages during their ab∣sence.
They recalled every mi∣nute
circumstance of their first
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
attachment.—Their pleasure
sometimes repressed, sometimes
indulged.—They formed schemes
for the future;—and pursued
measures for the prosecution of
plans still involved in uncertain∣ty;
—so that six months which
were elapsed, appeared no longer
within the walls of a convent,
than they would have done in
the palace of <HI>Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>CARDINI, by the request of
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> made a small progress
in his work; nor was the ab∣bess
displeased because her bar∣gain
was that the pictures should
be highly finished; and she was
easily persuaded the oftener they
were retouched, the more lasting
the colour would prove.—Yet,
as there was no reason to appre∣hend
the long residence of the
servants of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> at <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
might incite curiosity in those
who had seen them with their
master; he therefore sent them
to <HI>Nevus</HI> with orders not to say
to whom they belonged.</P>
<P>HE heard frequently from
<HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> whom he
informed of the happiness he
tasted; whilst he deceived the
earl and countess of <HI>Douglas</HI> with
reports the physicians recom∣mended
his trying the waters a∣nother
season; so they desisted
from pressing his return.—His
joy was inconceivable on receiv∣ing
accounts from <HI>England</HI> that
the earl of <HI>Warwick's</HI> arrival
was every day impatiently ex∣pected
by the family of <HI>Nevil,</HI>
who had been made acquainted
with the circumstances of his
escape, and that <HI>Julia</HI> was his
daughter. They likewise added
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
that the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was much
disturbed, and undetermined
how to act.—This satisfactory
news soon clouded by subsequent
dispatches from the countess of
<HI>Douglas,</HI> that if he wished once
more to see his father, no time
must be lost; for she feared he
was seized with a distemper that
threatened a final dissolution.</P>
<P>IN this alarming moment, na∣ture
and reason silenced his plead∣ing
love and tenderness. <HI>Julia</HI>
protested she would absolutely
insist on his repairing immedi∣ately
where duty required his
presence,—fortifying her advice
by the most powerful incite∣ments
—Consider, <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
said she, that my father will be
your companion back;—and
should you be so unfortunate as
to loose your own, it will be pro∣per
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
for you to take possession of
your estate. The consideration
that my interest is connected
with yours, has, I flatter my∣self,
some influence with my
<HI>Hyppolitus,.</HI> Not that riches or
poverty were material in <HI>Julia's</HI>
opinion, far superior to the al∣lurements
of the one, or the in∣conveniencies
of the other, she
regarded both with equal indif∣ference.
—To pass her life with
her dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> was the ul∣timate
wish of her soul,—satis∣fied
the extent of her ambition,
—nor was her heart capable of
forming vows for any other fe∣licity.
But she knew his gene∣rosity
would suffer in a diminu∣tion
of fortune, where she was
to partake, and that there wanted
a conviction of its being essen∣tially
necessary, to induce him
to leave St. <HI>Menoux.</HI> She pene∣trated
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
too well the conflict he
sustained. Good <HI>God!</HI> what ex∣travagance
of grief! what did
he not feel when the hour of
parting arrived! Or rather what
did they not both endure! Sen∣sations
so exquisitely painful,
were enough to separate the soul
from the body.</P>
<P>ON this melancholy occasion,
they expressed all that is tender
and passionate! and when lan∣guage
was exhausted,—their
streaming eyes and heart-break∣ing
sighs, described pathetically
the anguish and regret which pe∣netrated
their souls.—Ah! in
tryals like these, virtue and for∣titude
must exert their strongest
efforts to repel the imbecility of
the heart and spirit.—Hope,
their sole support, persuaded
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
them they soon should meet a∣gain,
and they had great reason
to listen to her soothing voice.</P>
<P>CARDINI was entrusted with
the management of the corres∣pondence
between the lovers,
and received a bountiful reward
for the services already perform∣ed,
as well as for those in rever∣sion.
The abbess was informed
the father of <HI>Jeronymo,</HI> had re∣called
him to <HI>Italy,</HI> nor was it
without regret she saw him de∣part;
whilst <HI>Julia,</HI> who had suf∣fered
the most violent constraint
in concealing her extreme afflic∣tion,
abandoned herself to the
unbounded indulgence of unut∣terable
woe. When her strain∣ing
eyes had lost all traces of the
object of their delight, she fas∣tened
the door of her chamber,
and sinking upon the bed, more
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
dead than alive, a torrent of tears
afforded some relief to her burst∣ing
heart. She feigned sickness
as an apology for keeping her a∣partment,
the better to conceal
her misery; but a short time
rendered its weight insupport∣able,
when she received no let∣ters
from <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—Frantic
with grief, she wrote to the earl
of <HI>Sussex,</HI> to enquire whether her
father or his friend was arrived
in <HI>London.</HI> He answered he was
in the utmost anxiety that neither
of them were returned, especially
as the death of the earl of <HI>Doug∣las</HI>
made his son's presence indis∣pensibly
requisite.</P>
<P>As those things we dread the
most, are those we are most rea∣dy
to believe, the desponding
<HI>Julia</HI> had little doubt but her lo∣ver
was shipwrecked;—and
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
though in the agony of separa∣tion,
she fancied nothing was ca∣pable
of augmenting her sorrow,
she proved alas! that the giver
of misfortune was not yet ex∣hausted,
and that the cruelty of
her destiny was still ingenious in
furnishing new scenes of tor∣ment.</P>
<P>ONE day she was in bed, in
the most deplorable dejection of
spirits, when the abbess paid her
a visit, and in retiring carelessly,
dropped a letter she had that
morning received. <HI>Isabella</HI> took
it up, and presented it to her
mistress, who instantly recog∣nized
the characters of the earl
of <HI>Bedford:</HI>—she opened it with
a trembling hand, and found
these words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
“CONSIDERATIONS of im∣portance,
madam, oblige me
to lose no time in removing
<HI>Julia</HI> to a place where she will
be in less danger of discovery
than with you. I have re∣ceived
intelligence that her
father's arrival is daily expect∣ed,
and that he is not unin∣formed
of his daughter's refi∣dence
at St. <HI>Menoux.</HI>—Un∣luckily
as this circumstance
may be, I shall never forget
the obligations to you, nor
the desire I have to acquit my∣self
of them, with gratitude.
—I am madam, with all pos∣sible
respect, your most obe∣dient
humble servant,”</P>
<CLOSER>“Bedford.”</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>THE fair <HI>Julia</HI> remained thun∣der
—struck for some minutes; re∣volving
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
in her mind what was
the most eligible step to take,—
sensible she ought no longer to
delay her removal from a place
where she must soon be exposed
to the irascibility of the earl of
<HI>Bedford;</HI> she took a sudden re∣solution,
and sent <HI>Isabella</HI> to de∣sire
<HI>Cardini</HI> would contrive some
pretext for coming into her a∣partment.
When he came, she
entreated him to take some
jewels of her's and dispose of
them at <HI>Moulins,</HI> and to purchase
a chariot and a pair of horses
with the money,—taking all ne∣cessary
precautions of secresy;—
likewise to buy a riding dress of
the common sort, and as soon as
all were ready, he should have
horses in waiting the following
night, to carry them to <HI>Moulins.</HI>
—The difficulty was to escape
unseen, but as her apartment was
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
next the garden, she determined
to hazard descending by a lad∣der
of ropes, which <HI>Cardini</HI> en∣gaged
to provide.—Luckily,
part of the garden wall had fallen
down, which she imagined would
facilitate her purpose of climbing
over it.</P>
<P>EVERY thing answered her
expectation: <HI>Cardini</HI> who had
free egress and regress to the
convent, acquitted himself with
the utmost zeal and address.—
He conducted <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI>
to <HI>Moulins,</HI> where they found a
chariot ready for the prosecution
of their journey <HI>Julia</HI> presented
the painter with a ring of con∣siderable
value, and commissioned
him to go to <HI>London,</HI> and acquaint
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
with the occasion of her
flight, and of her resolution to
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
remain at <HI>Florence</HI> with <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
till she heard of their safety.—
She was unwilling to trust the
particulars to writing, for fear
some unfortunate chance should
reveal it to the earl of <HI>Bedford;</HI>
not doubting but his knowledge
of her being at St. <HI>Menoux,</HI> was
procured by the interception of
her letters, or those of <HI>Hyppo∣litus.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST <HI>Julia</HI> continued to
travel with all possible diligence,
taking every precaution to avoid
discovery, and conceal from ob∣servation
that exquisite beauty
which drew admiration from the
spectators.—<HI>Cardini,</HI> after at∣tending
her as far as prudence
would permit, returned to St.
<HI>Menoux,</HI> to avoid surprize, and
applying to his work with seem∣ing
attention, expected every
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
moment to hear a general alarm
in the convent. The morning
was far advanced when one of
the nuns came to acquaint the
abbess, that <HI>Julia's</HI> apartment
was still locked, and though <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>
had been called several
times, no answer was returned,
which made her apprehend
this profound silence boded some∣thing
extraordinary. The ab∣bess
was disturbed at her relati∣on,
and gave instant orders for
breaking open the door; but
when on entering her apart∣ment,
she was convinced that
<HI>Julia</HI> had made her escape;—
nothing could excede the wildness
of her behaviour.</P>
<P>SHE sent messenger after mes∣senger
towards <HI>Paris,</HI> concluding
that must necessarily be the road
she had taken. At a loss what
to conjecture, her suspicion rested
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
next upon <HI>Cardini;</HI>—he was ar∣rested,
examined before a ma∣gistrate,
and committed to pri∣son,
without being able to draw
the least information by this
rough usage.—I expect the earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> every moment, said
the abbess, to those in whom
she confided; he will demand
his wife! what answer can I
give? How will he accuse me
of careless neglect? and what
excuses can I form for inatten∣tion
to a trust he so earnestly re∣commended?</P>
<P>IN this distress; one of her fa∣vourites
hit upon an expedient
that might for some time at least,
retard the earl's arrival, and the
reproaches she dreaded. I think,
madam, said she, you should
write the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> word
immediately, that his lady was
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
suddenly seized with an inflam∣matory
fever, which carried her
off in a few days; that she was ta∣ken
all possible care of, and that
you had rendered her the last du∣ties
suitable to her quality; that
she had bequeathed her jewels
and wardrobe to her maid <HI>Isa∣bella;</HI>
so that there was nothing
left worth returning.</P>
<P>THE abbess relished the de∣ception
extremely, not consider∣ing
the consequences that might
attend it; she was a woman of
birth, with no great depth of
understanding, therefore suffered
herself to be governed by the
<HI>young religious,</HI> who delivered the
counsel. She accordingly wrote
to the earl, to acquaint him
with the death of the countess:
but this step did not contribute
towards the release of the unfor∣tunate
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
<HI>Cardini,</HI> whose imprison∣ment
was of long duration; nor
was he permitted to plead in his
own desence, or acquaint his
friends with the state to which
he was reduced.</P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Julia</HI> ar∣rived
at <HI>Florence</HI> without any
disagreeable accident;—and
judging it improper to visit her
friend till she had given previous
notice, she wrote by <HI>Isabella</HI> to
acquaint her with her desire to
concert proper measures with her
for her security.—<HI>Lucilla</HI> was in∣expressibly
delighted to hear of
her arrival, nor would her im∣patience
to see her, allow the de∣ferring
it a single moment.—
Their meeting was all that the
most cordial and sincere friend∣ship
can express from persons of
sensibility and tenderness; and
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
agreed <HI>Julia</HI> should assume the
character of a young widow, a
near relation to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who in∣tended
to pass some months at
<HI>Florence:</HI> she was to take the
name of <HI>Howard,</HI> the first family
in <HI>England;</HI> so extensive in its
branches as not to be easily traced,
and to appear in deep mourning,
as having recently buried a hus∣band
extremely dear, which was
the cause of her abandoning a
country that perpetually remind∣ed
her of her loss.</P>
<P>WHAT was singular enough
is, that at the very time <HI>Julia</HI>
was playing this mockery of
woe, the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was
preparing to act the same part
more strenuously. The abbess's
letter was delivered just in time
to prevent his embarkation.—
The first emotions of grief were
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
lively for the death of a wife he
had so passionately loved;—but
reflexions on the length of his
voluntary separation;—on the
subject of complaint he believed
she had given him,—joined to
the natural inconstancy of man,
soon consoled his affliction, and
disposed him to indulge his
thoughts with any thing rather
than the remembrance of <HI>Julia.</HI></P>
<P>THE report soon became cur∣rent.
The countess of <HI>Douglas,</HI>
and the earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> were in
the utmost distress; and the earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who landed in
<HI>England,</HI> soon after the melan∣choly
tidings, was almost as deep∣ly
affected as if he had been per∣sonally
acquainted with the beau∣ty,
merit, and virtue of his ami∣able
daughter. Is not my fate
truly deplorable, said he, deliver∣ed
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
from the rigour of a long and
painful captivity.—restored to
my country after a tedious ab∣sence;
—only to hear of the death
of an only child, whose virtues
have been represented with the
highest encomiums.—Endeared
by the memory of her excellent
mother, as well as her own ac∣complishments.
—Alas! I had
promised her as a recompence,
to the only man in the world, to
whom I have the strongest obli∣gations;
—at the very moment
she falls a sacrifice to the un∣kindness
of an arbitrary husband!</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> solicited
through the mediation of friends
that Lord <HI>Warwick</HI> would per∣mit
him the honour to wait on
him;—but the application was
rejected with resentment and in∣dignation
by a father who con∣sidered
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
him as the murderer of
his daughter. Things were in
this situation when <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
made his appearance; what im∣peded
his voyage was, that in
posting from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> as
the most expeditious method of
travelling, his horse fell, and in
disengaging himself from under
him, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> dislocated his
ancle; the pain was so acute,
that with his valet's assistance,
it was not without the utmost
difficulty he walked to an adja∣cent
village, where the bone was
set by an unskilful surgeon, who
made him suffer such agony in
the operation, as brought on a
violent fever, which confined
him two months. Fear of a∣larming
the tenderness of <HI>Julia</HI>
occasioned him not to acquaint
her with this misfortune, and
the method he used to prevent
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
her unhappiness proved the very
cause of it. A silence so extraor∣dinary
made her desperate.—
It was now that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
to take his share of suffering,
when the first things he heard
in <HI>London,</HI> was the death of his
father, and that of his beloved
<HI>Julia;</HI> for the abbess of St. <HI>Me∣noux's</HI>
letter, falling into the
hands of the countess of <HI>Doug∣las,</HI>
she was tempted to shew it
to her son, from a hope she en∣tertained
that the certainty of
the fatal event, was the only ra∣dical
cure for a passion which had
been the source of all his misfor∣tunes.
—The disturber of his
tranquillity, whilst it checked all
views of aggrandizement and
promotion.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS had been long
enough at St. <HI>Menoux</HI> to enter
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
minutely into the abbess's cha∣racter,
ill calculated for a plot;
he therefore yielded an implicit
faith to her report that extin∣guished
the faint ray of hope still
struggling in his soul.</P>
<P>WHERE can I find words ca∣pable
of expressing the despair of
the most passionate and faithful
heart in the world? All former
descriptions of the state he was
reduced to by the marriage of
<HI>Julia;</HI>—the schemes laid to se∣parate
them;—the violent pro∣ceedings
of her husband,—con∣vey
but a faint idea of the dis∣traction
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in a con∣juncture
so terrible to human na∣ture!
He refused to see or speak
to any, but the earls of <HI>Warwick</HI>
and <HI>Sussex;</HI> nor could any thing
but the urgent entreaties of a
weeping mother have prevailed
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
on him to take the least nourish∣ment;
nor could he sleep more
than in broken starts on his un∣easy
bed;—he sunk suddenly
into a depression of spirits and
a decay of strength that prog∣nosticated
the most melancholy
consequences.</P>
<P>To the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> he con∣fided
his determined resolution
to challenge the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI>
the only prospect capable of ani∣mating
him with fresh courage
and vigour: he desired his friend
to demand the time and place of
appointment in his name, for
putting a period to a quarrel that
could not be terminated but by
the death of the injurer or in∣jured.
The earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> ex∣patiated
on the rashness of a man's
engaging in a duel who had
scarcely strength to walk to the
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
place of action.—<HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
replied, he was the best judge of
what he was capable;—that des∣pair
would supply all defects.—
At the most he could but die;—
and to measure swords with the
enemy of his peace, was the least
circumstance likely to appall him!
After many repeated instances,
the earl found it in vain to con∣tend
against a point so absolutely
settled in the breast of his friend:
—he therefore waited on the
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and found him
very irresolute what answer to
return. The earl, in truth, was
but lately recovered of the wounds
he had received from <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
at <HI>Calais;</HI>—he was convinced
of his valour, and sensible of
the powerful motives of his ani∣mosity:</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93"/>
AFTER some pause, he ob∣served
that, though the king had
testified his disapprobation of
duelling, he was ready to accept
the challenge; but it was pro∣per
their meeting should appear
accidental; when he would draw
and finish the controversy.</P>
<P>No sooner had Lord <HI>Sussex</HI>
taken his leave, than the earl of
<HI>Bedford</HI> made a speedy arrange∣ment
of his affairs, and left the
kingdom.—<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> sought
him every where, and did not
discover he was gone abroad till
it was too late to overtake him.
—He was exceedingly mortified
at the disappointment of his only
surviving hope, to sacrifice this
victim to the manes of his ado∣rable
<HI>Julia.</HI>—He could no long∣er
endure the sight of places
which renewed the tortures in
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
his memory, the scenes of irre∣trievable
happiness! He deter∣mined
to fly from a country once
so dear, and to bury himself and
his misfortunes in distant fields
of glory.</P>
<P>FINDING his resolution not to
be shaken, the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>
proposed his accompanying him
to <HI>Malta,</HI> where he was return∣ing
with the <HI>grand conservator</HI> of
<HI>Montserrat,</HI> who had been a
short time in <HI>England,</HI> and to
whom the queen, in complai∣sance
to Cardinal <HI>Pole's</HI> solicita∣tion,
had granted the restitution
of all the forfeited estates of the
knights of <HI>Malta. Hyppolitus</HI>
gladly accepted an occasion of
signalizing his gallantry, as well
as of attaching himself to the
fortune of a nobleman whom he
loved as a father, and honoured
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
with singular esteem for his ex∣alted
qualities.—The earl of
<HI>Sussex</HI> was desirous to join the
party. as he had particular rea∣sons
to retire from court.</P>
<P>QUEEN MARY was unwil∣ling
to grant to the solicitations
of himself and friends, the return
of the marchioness of <HI>Northamp∣ton;</HI>
she still continued to per∣secute
the memory of her unfor∣tunate
husband in the person of
his beautiful widow, and as her
majesty had been informed the
the earl was desperately in love
with her, and eagerly wished to
marry her, she made a point of
opposing their union; and, as a
step towards it, expressed her
wish that he would think of Lord
<HI>Montagu's</HI> daughter. She had
just appointed the father ambas∣sador
to the holy see, together
with the bishop of <HI>Ely;</HI>—his
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
lordship recommended her to the
queen, and begged her majesty
would be troubled with her es∣tablishment.
The queen, tho∣roughly
acquainted with the me∣rit,
birth and fortune of Lord
<HI>Sussex,</HI> thought she could not
dispose of her more advantage∣ously
than to that nobleman, but
he, incapable of sacrificing the
passion of love to that of ambi∣tion,
prudently resolved to with∣draw,
till the queen altered her
sentiments; and beheld an occa∣sion
with pleasure that insepara∣bly
united his fate with that of
his intimate friend, with whom
he might acquire laurels, or die
in the attempt.</P>
<P>THEY gave directions for their
departure; <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> wished to
conceal it from the countess of
<HI>Douglas,</HI> to avoid the opposition
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
of parental tenderness, which it
would be fresh pain to struggle
with. What facilitated the se∣cresy
of his enterprize, was his
being totally independant.</P>
<P>THE three friends left <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
without any one suspecting
their intention.—In regard to
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> no country or soil af∣forded
him a prospect of com∣fort;
all were equally indiffer∣ent.
On arriving at <HI>Malta,</HI> they
found the inhabitants greatly
distressed at the devastations made
by a dreadful storm, which had
sunk four galleys In the port, be∣sides
several other vessels. The
number of knights and slaves
whose bodies were thrown on the
beach, was a more melancholy
spectacle, besides a large party
of <HI>Maltese</HI> volunteers, who served
for very moderate pay in the
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
room of criminals sentenced to
the oar. Not long after, <HI>Fran∣cis</HI>
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the grand prior,
appeared in the harbour with two
galleys painted and guilt. The
magnificence of this prince was
equal in every particular to his
illustrious birth:—he was hand∣some,
liberal, gallant, brave and
magnanimous. General <HI>de la
Valette</HI> had resigned his employ∣ments
in his favour. The three
earls were honourably received
by the grand master, who pre∣sented
them to the prior, to
whom they offered their services,
which were accepted with all the
marks of distinction and polite∣ness
their merit could expect
from a great and discerning of∣ficer.</P>
<P>WITH a reinforcement of
three more galleys, they sailed
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
for the coast of <HI>Barbary</HI> in pur∣suit
of <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> till encoun∣tering
a brigantine near <HI>Tripoli,</HI>
which they soon boarded, they
learned that <HI>Dragut Rais</HI> was so
bent upon the reduction of <HI>Tri∣poli,</HI>
he would not put to sea
that year.</P>
<P>THIS information occasioned
their seeking other opportunities
of signalizing their valour.—
This <HI>English</HI> triumvirate dis∣played
proofs of courage and
conduct that charmed the com∣mander,
and induced him to
bestow honours and employ∣ments
adequate to their birth.—
They exposed their lives to per∣petual
hazard.—Insensible and
careless of danger, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
was foremost in every attack;
where we must now leave him,
and return to St. <HI>Menoux.</HI> The
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
abbess▪ satisfied by the earl of
<HI>Bedford's</HI> answer, he entertained
no doubt of the countess's death,
nor had any intention of coming
to <HI>France,</HI> thought it unnecessary
to retain <HI>Cardini</HI> longer a prison∣er,
whose confinement only en∣creased
his obstinate denial of the
share he had in <HI>Julia's</HI> escape;
an invincible perseverance of
temper that contributed to his
enlargement.—He no sooner
found himself free, than he pre∣pared
to keep the promise he had
made <HI>Julia,</HI> of going to <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
he soon arrived: but vain
was his enquiries for the three
friends: he was told in general,
they had not been seen at court
for some time; but no traces
where they were gone could he
discover.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101"/>
HE likewise was informed
that since the death of his lady,
the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> seldom ap∣peared
in public.</P>
<P>CARDINI was extremely con∣cerned
for the loss of his fair and
generous benefactress; and con∣cluded
the terror and fatigue she
endured in her journey to <HI>Italy,</HI>
had probably shortened her days:
—having no farther business in
<HI>London,</HI> he returned to <HI>Paris;</HI>
whilst <HI>Julia</HI> languished with im∣patience
to hear news on which
her peace depended,—from
those who were convinced she no
longer existed, and whose tears
paid a constant tribute to her
memory.</P>
<P>SHE was still with her friend
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> where she passed for an
unhappy relict, of a retired dis∣position,
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
—averse to company,
—who wished that civility would
dispense with quitting her own
appartment, and conversing with
any other person than <HI>Lucilla!</HI>
The air of pensive melancholy
which anxiety impressed, render∣ed
her beauty peculiarly attrac∣tive.</P>
<P>ARE the dead only to be de∣plored,
madam? said Senator <HI>Al∣herti,</HI>
one day to her; have you
no pity in reserve for the dying?
These words were accompanied
with a look so passionate, that to
avoid a repetition, <HI>Julia</HI> fixing
her eyes upon the ground, ans∣wered,
sorrowfully,—Leave me,
my lord, to the indulgence of
my woe;—I find a kind of
pleasure in enjoying it uninter∣rupted!
The idea that the se∣nator
was sensibly captivated, was
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
an aggravation of her grief. He
was yet of an age to be suscep∣tible;
—was still a handsome
man of fashion and gallantry;—
positive in any humour or fancy
he conceived;—held frequent
consultations with his heart on the
elegibility of second marriages;—
but parental fondness, and fear of
injuring the fortune of his son,
curbed his inclination, till he
beheld the faithful;—the pru∣dent;—the
sensible <HI>Julia!</HI> and
at the first glance was passionately
enamoured.—His attentive
assiduity importuned her greatly;
—she sometimes resolved to
treat him with such disdain as
should lessen his attempts to
please, by convincing him of the
impossibility;—would draw ma∣licious
descriptions of persons
advanced in years, who flattered
themselves with being agreeable
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
lovers.—What can they ex∣pect,
would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he say, but to be
rejected by women of sincerity
and honour;—or deceived by
those of an opposite character?—
I own, were it possible for my
heart ever to receive a second
impression, it must be effected by
the first emotions of surprize;—
my eyes must be dazzled;—
my senses enchanted with admi∣ration;
—my heart must be∣tray
me before I have time to call
reflection to my aid!—Now
there is no danger of this sort to
be apprehended from men in the
decline of life; for the first ap∣pearance
is always unfavourable.
—It is not possible to form an
immediate prepossession. That
can only arrise from long habit,
and a thorough knowledge of
their internal merit! And no
woman, in my opinion, would
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
expose herself deliberately to the
most dreadful of all situations, a
solemn engagement with a man
past his meridian!—Whoever
consults their reason must see it
in the same light, I am certain!
—Sure nothing is so absurd as
the ridiculous persuasion of rais∣ing
a flame in the breast of youth
from the ashes of old age!—
The behaviour of these old fops
is really insupportable.—They
deviate from their natural bent
to assume the manners adapted
to the charms they adore! with∣out
considering that love is child∣ish
and playful;—pursues plea∣sure
and gaity!—A man must
be endowed with a genious of the
first rate!—possess an imagination
of the most lively and agreeable
cast indeed, to appear at fifty in
the character of an inamarato
without becoming contemptible!
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
The senator hearkened to these
sallies with extreme impatience.</P>
<P>YOU have such an aversion
madam, for all that are neither
so handsome or so young as your∣self,
interrupted he, that there is
scarce a probability you should
fall in love! Ah! how impos∣sible
for any to flatter themselves
with the hope of pleasing on such
conditions! at least if beauty is
the principal allurement! But,
this I will venture to say, in de∣fiance
of those unfortunate cul∣prits
of whom you, madam, have
assumed the office of both judge
and jury to condemn, that their
discernment and judgement are
stronger than those of younger
men; they are more respectful,
faithful, discreet; more devoted
to the object of their adoration!
Disdaining trifling sollies, un∣worthy
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
of hearts capable of a
serious attachment; when once
such men love, it is for ever.—
And, in reality, what satisfac∣tion
can there be in the desire of
pleasing, or of being beloved by
those volatile genius's whose
flame is of the meteor kind;—
sparkling;—but unsteady;—
who are lost in the very moment
you think to fix them.</P>
<P>THE turn of their conversa∣tion
was pretty much in this
style; but though <HI>Julia</HI> exerted
her wit in such sarcastic raillery
as left him the liberty of parti∣cular
application without wound∣ing
politeness; yet, in defiance
of despair, and the secret resent∣ment
he felt at her indifference,
he wanted resolution to extract
the fatal arrow destructive to his
repose.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108"/>
JULIA did not at first appre∣hend
any bad consequences from
a frenzy which served to divert
her, and when she seriously en∣deavoured
to stop its progress
found the attempt too late.—
Her fears were alarmed by the
furious transports of <HI>Alberti,</HI>—
who declared she must either
see him die at her feet, or con∣sent
to marry him.—She re∣presented
the injury this alliance
would be to <HI>Leander,</HI> that she
never would consent to injure her
best friend and relation, and was
absolutely determined to live sin∣gle
the remainder of her days.</P>
<P>WHATEVER she alledged in
opposition to his love afflicted,
without convincing <HI>Alberti</HI> of
the impropriety of his behaviour.
—He said she might exercise
her cruelty as much as she pleas∣ed,
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
—that he would immediately
disinherit his son, as considera∣tion
for his interest was one ob∣stacle
that opposed his felicity.
—His silent menaces succeed∣ed;
—mingled with such wild
extravagance of expression, as
evidently shewed he had given
the reins to passion;—that he
was no longer under the restraint
of decency;—and that <HI>Julia</HI>
had every thing to dread from
rage and disappointment.</P>
<P>ON his leaving the room,
<HI>Julia</HI> flew to her friend, tears
streaming from her eyes;—My
dear sister, said she, here are
more misfortunes! your father-in-law
has been saying things
that distract me.—You know
we have sometimes laughed at
the thoughts of his fancying him∣self
in love:—Alas! it is no
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
longer a jest!—but a fatal truth
that will compel me to leave
you.—He urges me to marry
him in terms a tyrant would use
to his slave! The power he has
in the city flatters him with suc∣cess
in any scheme he may form;
—and I really think, before he
is farther irritated, it will be in∣cumbent
on me to get out of his
clutches. Think, my dear <HI>Lucil∣la,</HI>
what innumerable afflictions
I have to contend with.—No
news of my father, or my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> for these four month,
that I have found a safe retreat
under your friendly roof;—all
our strict enquiries are able to
produce is, they have left <HI>Lon∣don!</HI>
—But, Good <HI>God!</HI> where
are they? Can it be possible
after what I wrote from St. <HI>Me∣noux</HI>
by <HI>Cardini,</HI> both should de∣sert
me? O, how exquisite are
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
my sufferings for them;—and
have I not every thing to fear
from my husband's wrath!—
every thing from <HI>Alberti's</HI> mad∣ness?</P>
<P>THE agony of her soul pre∣vented
her from proceeding;—
Forbear, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> to aban∣don
yourself to an excess of des∣pondency,
which is not permit∣ted
us to indulge without of∣fending
<HI>Heaven!</HI> Your misfor∣tunes,
<HI>God</HI> be praised, are not so
heavy, as to afford no prospect of
relief: I am convinced some im∣portant
reasons we are not able,
at present to penerate, have oc∣casioned
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and
my brother to leave <HI>England;</HI>—
my mother, from whom they
concealed their intention, will, I
doubt not, find out the secret,
and acquaint us with it, if they
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
are not very quick in prevent∣ing
her by telling the tale first,
which I have an impulse will
happen within a few days! As
to your husband we will set his
authority at defiance, whilst you
are under our protection;—and
for the puissant hero, who is in
such a hurry to become so, we
will represent certain invincible
obstacles which will soon oblige
him to desist.</P>
<P>YOU flatter yourself, my dear
sister!—replied <HI>Julia,</HI> believe
me, the senator will remain in∣credulous
to all we can advance;
—whatever controverts his de∣sign
will be suspected;—he will
consider it as an artifice practised
to elude his hopes:—and I am
certain, this ill placed confidence
might be a means of the earl of
<HI>Bedford's</HI> discovering my con∣cealment;
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
without in the least
convincing your father!—The
most rational thought is to take
refuge in a convent with all pos∣sible
secrecy and expedition.</P>
<P>LUCILLA approved her friend's
intention.—She ordered her
coach and drove directly to a
convent, where she had great
interest. But the amorous sena∣tor,
dreading to lose his mis∣tress,
and convinced from her
expressions she would take some
resolution contrary to his wishes,
was careful to watch the coach
whenever they went abroad, and
ventured to bribe a servant, whose
fidelity they did not distrust; from
whom he received intelligence
<HI>Julia</HI> was to be admitted by the
abbess that very week.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114"/>
HE was ready to sink at the
news, sensible nothing but a∣version
to him could dictate such
a measure. In vain did he sum∣mon
reason, virtue, and even
resentment, to his aid.—
Abandoned to the tyranny of the
most incontrolable of all the pas∣sions,
—the idea of being des∣pised
by <HI>Julia,</HI> added fresh fuel
to the flame he just before wished
to extinguish;—it raged with
redoubled fury,—and impelled
him to desperate remedies, since
his tender perseverance made no
impression.</P>
<P>PROMPTED by resentment and
desire, he found it easy to exe∣cute
his purpose:—<HI>Julia's</HI> a∣partment
was on the ground
floor, next the garden;—into
which it opened by a large glass
door: <HI>Isabella</HI> lay in a little room
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
adjoyning; but that evening,
through the address of the ser∣vant
<HI>Alberti</HI> had employed, she
sat later than usual with <HI>Lucilla's</HI>
woman; which, as her lady sel∣dom
went early to bed, <HI>Isabella</HI>
was easily prevailed upon to do.
—The evening was warm, and
<HI>Julia</HI> had opened the garden
door to enjoy the fresh air, whilst
she wrote to her dearest <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI>
an employment seldom one day
omitted: tho' she knew not where
to find the constant object of her
meditation, she hoped some time
or other, to send him these proofs
of remembrance:</P>
<P>“AT an hour which the great∣est
part of the world appro∣priate
to sleep, I awake to re∣lieve
my sorrows by commu∣nication.
Alas! my <HI>Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
how insupportable!—
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
how exquisite is my distress!
deprived of every means of
intelligence;—ignorant of
what fate attends you;—in∣capable
of suspecting your
heart of inconstancy, I never∣theless,
feel too sensibly, some
assurances of its fidelity are es∣sential
to the preservation of a
life that will become indif∣ferent
to me when it ceases to
be dear to you! That only
hope renders it supportable!
and ever since Senator <HI>Alberti</HI>
ventured to declare his pas∣sion,
I”</P>
<P>HERE the pen dropped from
her hand at the appearance of
three persons masqued, who se∣cured
her in their arms, whilst a
fourth, still more carefully dis∣guised
than the rest, held a hand∣kerchief
to her mouth, and bore
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
her away inspite of her stifled
cries and resistance.—They
hastily traversed the garden;—
the night was far advanced, and
very dark, unheard by any of
the family.—They lifted <HI>Julia</HI>
into a coach that was waiting,
and driving fast through the city
on the <HI>Sienna</HI> side: they took
the road towards the mountains,
which was so very rugged, that
the pole striking violently against
a rock, broke in two. As the
summer nights in <HI>Italy</HI> are re∣markably
short,—day began to
appear, when he who seemed
master of the rest, finding the
coach of no farther use, mounted
his horse, and ordered his ser∣vant
to place <HI>Julia</HI> before him.</P>
<P>SHE defended herself with
courage superior to her sex;—
No, tyrant, cried she, thou shalt
not drag me from hence till thou
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
hast deprived me of life! thou
violator of rhe rights of hospita∣lity;
—thou persecuter of a
friendless woman who fled to
thee for refuge, and whom thou
art now forcing from the sanc∣tuary
thy house ought to afford
her! whilst she spoke, she dis∣engaged
her hands from the men
who endeavoured to obey their
master's command; but the awe
her words inspired, added to her
extreme beauty, touched them
with compassion, lest they should
hurt her in the attempt;—whilst
they balanced, eight cavaliers,
well mounted and armed, ad∣vanced
towards them;—the
first that struck the wan∣dering
eyes of <HI>Julia,</HI> was the
Senator <HI>Alberti;</HI>—who with
his attendants attacked the ra∣vishers:
who, on their side, pre∣pared
to repel them.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="119"/>
DURING this furious rencoun∣ter,
<HI>Julia</HI> seized the advantage
liberty presented, of attempt∣ing
to escape, by a winding path
down the side of the mountain;
this she pursued with the utmost
hazard and apprehension;—
though repeated firing convinced
her the engagement still continu∣ed;
she dreaded they should dis∣patch
one of their train in search of
her: her imagination represent∣ed
she had as much to fear from
those who came to her assistance,
as from her unknown ravishers;
who these could be, conjecture
afforded no light:—bewildered
in reflexion, panting for breath;
—her feet hurt with the rug∣gedness
of the way;—alarmed
with every breath of wind;—
unmindful where she wandered,
she entangled herself in the midst
of briars;—her beautiful face
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
was streaked with blood;—her
fair disheveled hair covered part
of her shoulders, which the thorns
had stripped naked.</P>
<P>IN this mangled situation she
must have excited pity in the
most inhuman mind. At a loss
where to direct her trembling
steps, she looked round with im∣ploring
eyes, and perceived a
shepherd's cot on the edge of a
valley, which revived her hopes,
when they were just expiring.—
She here found a shepherdess at
work in a little garden, who
struck with her deplorable ap∣pearance,
and wildness of distress,
received her with marks of ten∣derness
that afforded some con∣solation
to the lovely wanderer.
O, said she, with impetuosity,
dear good woman, if you are
disposed confer a benefit that will
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
bind me to you for ever; find
out quickly some place to con∣ceal
me from my pursuers, who
will soon tear me hence by force.
The shepherdess, without loosing
a moment, led her to a hayloft,
filled with fodder for sheep, and
covering her securely, returned
to her spade:—just after, two
horsemen on full gallop, stopped
at the hut, and questioned her
with great earnestness about a
young lady for whom they were
in search; intermixing threats
with their enquiries:—she de∣nied
having seen her, with an
unembarassed simplicity, that in∣duced
them to turn their horses,
and ride off.</P>
<P>THEY were no sooner depart∣ed,
than the shepherdess ran to
the relief of <HI>Julia,</HI> who heard
the the Senator <HI>Alberti's</HI> voice,
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
and was half dead with terror;
but revived with the news that
the men were gone!—Her kind
hostess brought her some milk
and bread, washed the blood
from her face, and assisted in re∣pairing
her garments with chari∣table
industry.</P>
<P>JULIA was unwilling to leave
this rural spot, judging it unsafe
to venture out till the hurry of
the chase was over. Her thoughts
were in the utmost perplexity;
much had she to fear from the
machinations of <HI>Alberti,</HI> but more
from those of her unknown e∣nemy,
who continued to wear
his masque till their separation.
—It seemed a less difficulty to
guard against the attempts of a
person she knew, than to dis∣trust
every body who offered her
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
assistance, lest she should inad∣vertently
run into the very dan∣ger
she studied to avoid.</P>
<P>THIS agitation of mind aug∣mented
the weakness of her bo∣dy.
—The shepherd returned
in the evening, and it was ne∣cessary
<HI>Julia</HI> should consent to
his being made acquainted with
her situation.</P>
<P>THE shepherd was a penetra∣ting
old man, who properly con∣jectured
by the admirable beauty
of his new guest, and the ma∣terials
of her dress, that she must
be above the common rank.—
He was touched with her pecu∣liar
distress. <HI>Julia</HI> asked if he
had seen any gentlemen on horse∣back
that day? He answered
several, some of which were
masqued, and seemed wounded,
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
yet were riding full speed. One
he said, rode off from his com∣panions
to the field where he was
at work, and enquired whether
he had not met with a young la∣dy
unattended;—that answer∣ing
in the negative, the person
continued his road.</P>
<P>JULIA, convinced she was the
object of his enquiry, passed one
of the most uncomfortable nights
she had ever experienced. For∣tunately
she had her purse and
some jewels about her, not hav∣ing
began to undress, when she
sat down to write: this enabled
her to make such pecuniary ac∣knowledgments
to the good
folks <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or their hospitality as
might at the same time engage
them from interested considera∣tions
to serve her with fidelity.
You see the distress I am in, said
she, bursting into tears, and the
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
absolute necessity I am under of
leaving you, and seeking shelter
in some place of safety.—But
tell me, how I may travel un∣discovered?
—I am too much
terrified to judge for my∣self.
—I should think, ma∣dam,
said the shepherdess, would
you vouchfase to put on one of
my caps and gowns, you would
never be found out. <HI>Julia</HI> ac∣cepted
the offer, and was soon
transformed into a shepherdess;
—but she appeared so charming,
that the good man and his wife
both agreed it was impossible for
any dress to deprive her of that
natural air of dignity, so con∣spicuous
in her every motion.</P>
<P>AFTER some little considera∣tion,
he advised her to conceal
her sex under a pilgrim's habit,
and as she was very tall, thought
she might unsuspectedly pass for
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
a young man. She approved his
council, and entreated him to
buy what was requisite at <HI>Sienna.</HI>
He set out instantly to execute
her orders; and whilst he is thus
employed, let us return to what
passed in <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>THE very night, as I have be∣fore
observed, that <HI>Julia</HI> was
seized by persons unknown, had
been fixed upon by <HI>Alberti</HI> for
the same design, <HI>Isabella,</HI> seduced
by one of <HI>Lucilla's</HI> women to
discontinue her attendance long∣er
than ordinary, and beginning
to fear she might keep her
lady up too late, entered her
apartment, soon after she had
been forced from it. Seeing the
fragments of her veil on the floor,
the table, chairs, and candles o∣verturned,
and <HI>Julia</HI> gone, she
concluded some new misfortune
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
had happened, and cried out in
a manner that alarmed the fa∣mily,
particularly the senator,
who was preparing for the com∣mencement
of the scene he in∣tended
to exhibit. The distress
of <HI>Isabella</HI> announced the cause;
in a transport of despair, he or∣dered
his servants, already armed,
to pursue the ravishers.—He
learned from the porter of the
gate <HI>La Croix,</HI> that money had
been given him to admit a coach
and six to pass in the night,
under pretence of avoiding the
heat of the weather. <HI>Leander,</HI>
disturbed with the uproar in the
house, mounted his horse, and
joined the train by the time they
overtook the coach; the battle,
from the superiority of numbers
on the <HI>Alberti</HI> side was of short
duration: the chief finding him∣self
wounded, essayed to gain the tains.

followed by his servants▪
one only was disabled from pro∣ceeding
farther, whom <HI>Leander</HI>
observing dismounted, and ta∣king
off his masque, used every
perswasion to induce him to re∣veal
the truth. But all he could
obtain was, that aparently, his
master was in love with <HI>Julia,</HI>
as he had long since formed a
resolution to carry her off;—
that what precipitated the execu∣tion
of this design, was a servant
of <HI>Alberti's,</HI> whom he had bribed
to facilitate his enterprize, adver∣tising
him that the senator in∣tended
taking the lady away that
very night. <HI>Leander</HI> asked the
name of his master, but received
no answer to that question.—
Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ider, sir, said the man, in a
voice scarcely articulate, I am
dying, and allow me a few mi∣nutes
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
to reconcile myself with
<HI>Heaven.</HI> A quarter of an hour
decided his fate.</P>
<P>ALBERTI returned to <HI>Flo∣rence</HI>
in the most violent agita∣tion
of mind, and when he had
shut himself up in his closet, re∣collected
a paper he had gathered
up in <HI>Julia's</HI> apartment, which
seemed her own hand-writing;
taking it from his pocket, he
soon had the sensible mortifica∣tion
to be convinced her heart
was engaged; and that this pre∣possession
accounted for her cold∣ness.</P>
<P>I FLATTERED myself, he ex∣claimed,
that at least her indif∣ference
was general, and that
she treated me with as much
complaisance as she did the rest
of the world!—Alas! how
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
much was I mistaken! that pro∣found
melancholy in which she
was plunged, was the effect of
her lover's absence, and the con∣temptuous
scorn with which she
repaid my addresses, was a sa∣crifice
she offered to his vanity;
ruminating long who this dear
<HI>dear Hyppolitus</HI> might be,—to
whom the letter was addressed,
he recollected the brother of <HI>Ju∣lia,</HI>
the handsome,—the accom∣plished
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> formed to
charm, and to be charmed! A
mortal trepidation seized him at
the idea of his formidable rival!
Good <HI>Heaven!</HI> said he, can I
have the temerity at my age, to
contend with him for so fair a
prize?</P>
<P>PENETRATED with grief, he
entered his daughter-in-law's
appartment.—Calm my dis∣turbed
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
imagination <HI>Lucilla,</HI> said
he with impetuosity;—I know
your brother is the lover of your
<HI>English</HI> friend? I conjure you
not to dissemble. <HI>Lucilla</HI> hesi∣tated
what she ought to reply,
and her embarrasment denoted
some mystery she was unwilling
to explain.</P>
<P>SHE could no longer resist the
importunity of <HI>Alberti,</HI> or avoid
relating the history of <HI>Julia.</HI>
—Surprized and shocked at the
thought of what she had suffered
through his persecution, anguish
overwhelmed his spirits.—What
exquisite distress had you spared
me, said <HI>Alberti,</HI> when his words
could find a passage, had you
sooner judged me worthy of con∣fidence.
Witness to the birth
of my passion, you knew the im∣possibility
of its success; yet
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
would not endeavour to stop the
course of a torrent that hurls me
down the precipice of life! Ad∣ding
some severe reproaches to
these words.—Torn with love,
jealousy, despair,—he left <HI>Lucil∣la</HI>
abruptly, so disordered, he was
obliged to be put to bed: a burn∣ing
fever ensued which in a few
days reduced him to the last ex∣tremity.
He died tenderly re∣gretted
by his worthy son, and
the rest of his friends.</P>
<P>WHILST they paid the tribute
of tears to the memory of <HI>Alberti,</HI>
the unfortunate, but innocent
cause of his death, quitted the
hovel where she had been shel∣tered
several days, in a pilgrim's
attire, first gratifiying her kind
hosts with all the money she
could spare, and requesting the
conveyance of a letter to <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
relating her disastrous adventure,
and her resolution to travel out
of the reach of her enemies.—
She then took the road to <HI>Bou∣logna,</HI>
intending to proceed from
thence to <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> ho∣ping
in one of these cities to be
so fortunate as to find her father,
or at least to meet with some of
his friends, whom respect to his
worth might induce to place her
in a convent, till she could ap∣pear
in the world with securi∣ty.</P>
<P>HER thoughts were still oc∣cupied
with the four masqued ad∣venturers;
and after an infinite
variety of conjectures, she at
length thought it must be an ex∣ploit
of the Marquis <HI>Strozzi's,</HI>
descended from one of the first
families in <HI>Florence.</HI> This no∣bleman
was just returned from
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
making the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
had expressed an extravagant ad∣miration
of <HI>Julia,</HI> far surpassing
the common emotions excited by
beauty. He had merit, was
brave and enterprizing; and se∣veral
of his adventures she had
heard recounted, confirmed this
character; besides he was a <HI>Flo∣rentine,</HI>
and had little to appre∣hend
from the consequence of
offering violence to a stranger,
whose distance from her country
deprived her of the assistance of
relations to revenge the outrage.
—These considerations bid her
to believe the ravisher could be
no other than <HI>Strozzi.</HI></P>
<P>JULIA's person was com∣pletely
elegant, that the habit of
a pilgrim could not prevent her
being regarded with inquisitive
applause by all spectators.—
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
She had cut her hair like the
men; it fell in loose curls on her
shoulders, but the scorching rays
of the sun were unable to alter
the beauty of its colour; or that
of the delicate complexion it
shaded.—She was obliged to
make short stages, as her consti∣tution
was too tender to endure
long ones without fatigue; and
having passed <HI>Ficresol</HI> on the great
<HI>Appenine</HI> road, she drew near
<HI>Bologna,</HI> when she was delighted
with the entrance into a pleasant
wood, and to find the air per∣fumed
with orange and myrtle
trees. The sun was setting.—
The gentle murmur of a rivulet,
whose banks were bordered with
turf, invited her to repose, and
furnished a bed as commodious
as she could expect, under the
shade of a spreading tree, whose
root served for a pillow, whilst
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
the great hat the pilgrims wear,
formed a kind of umbrella.—
<HI>Julia,</HI> faint and weary, sunk into
the arms of sleep. Two circum∣stances
soon caused her to wake
in the utmost agony and surprize:
—the sensation of pain on find∣ing
her leg pierced with an ar∣row,
was mingled with terror at
the sound of horns, and the cry
of dogs and huntsmen.—She
shrieked with anguish, and was
essaying to extract the point of
the arrow, when she beheld three
ladies mounted on fine horses;
the gallantry of their dress and
appearance, suspended for a short
space the torture of her wound,
in the admiration they excited.
A bow fastened to her girdle,
and a quiver of arrows at her
shoulder, gave the principal fair
one, the air of <HI>Diana</HI> attended
by her nymphs.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137"/>
IN the most charming accent
she expressed her grief and vex∣ation,
on sight of the pilgrim
wounded by her own arrow!—
By what unhappy fatality, she ex∣claimed,
have I been driven to
commit this cruel action, when
I was only displaying the dexte∣rity
of my aim to these ladies?
Never surely were two persons
so unfortunate! The pity you
bestow, madam, said <HI>Julia</HI> in a
languishing tone of voice, is ca∣pable
of asswaging the anguish of
the wound you have given! I
fear it affords little comfort in
the situation to which I have re∣duced
you, to assure you my com∣passion
is strongly moved, replied
the lady, and as the first step to∣wards
attonement for my inno∣cent
crime, I entreat you will
consent to be removed to my
house till your cure is perfected.
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
She immediately ordered one of
her gentlemen to bind up the
pilgrim's wound, and convey him
in a chaise to the castle.</P>
<P>JULIA, in her desponding
state, could see nothing more e∣ligible
than what was proposed;
thanking her for her generous
care, she, by the help of her at∣tendant,
got into the chaise.—
He acquainted her on the way,
that his lady was lately married;
—that she belonged to the house
of <HI>Becarelli,</HI> very considerable
in <HI>Bologna;</HI> that she was an only
child, and her father, regretting
the extinction of an illustrious
name, resolved to choose a son-in-law,
who would adopt that
and his arms: to which he had
added an immense fortune.—
That the marquiss of <HI>Becarelli,</HI>
her husband's title, had been
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
some time from home, and that
the huntresses in her party were
relations and neighbours, fond of
those diversions suitable to their
rank.</P>
<P>HE then interrogated <HI>Julia</HI>
where she was travelling; ex∣cuse
me sir, continued he, if I
say you appear too much above
your habit, that though I never
saw you before, I am persuaded
you are a man of quality.—It
is of no consequence what I am,
replied <HI>Julia,</HI> but to satisfy your
enquiry, I will inform you my
name is <HI>Silvis,</HI> that I am going
to <HI>Loretto;</HI>—and that fortune
has placed me in a condition to
have nothing more to fear.—
You let me into the secret in a
few words, continued the atten∣dant,
but persons to whom na∣ture
has been so lavish, can, I
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
should imagine, have no real
cause for that fixed melancholy
observable in your countenance.
Here the chaise stopped, and the
stranger was led into a magni∣ficient
appartment.</P>
<P>THE marchioness's valet de
chambre who was a good sur∣geon,
dressed <HI>Silvis's</HI> leg, for so
I shall call him at present.—
The arrow had glanced along the
surface, so as to occasion acute
pain, but had not entered deep
enough for any danger to be ap∣prehended.
When the marchi∣oness
and the two ladies return∣ed,
they hastened to the pilgrim's
chamber; her gentleman re∣counted
the conversation between
them, and she subscribed the
justness of his remarks, that
there was something noble and
commanding in <HI>Silvis's</HI> physiog∣siognomy,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
that spoke him a per∣son
of distinction. She stayed
but a short time; yet the idea
of the lovely pilgrim played round
her heart in such a manner she
got no sleep all the night, and
under the pretext of charity, re∣newed
her visit early in the mor∣ning.</P>
<P>ARE you more easy? said she,
in the most obliging manner,
and have you pardoned the in∣jury
I have been guilty of?—
Madam, answered <HI>Silvis,</HI> were
you more acquainted with my
disposition, you would not be∣lieve
so flight a wound could raise
my resentment. I protest, on
the contrary, I esteem it a hap∣piness
to receive it from so fair a
hand. The marchioness affected
inattention to the gallantry of a
compliment which penetrated her
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
very soul; and seemed to indi∣cate
she had not made a slighter
impression on the heart of the
young stranger than he had done
on her's.</P>
<P>HAVE you ever seen any thing
half so charming <HI>Eugenia?</HI> said
she to a favourite maid in whom
she confided. Did you observe
with what fond expression the
young <HI>Silvis</HI> regarded me?—I
read his heart, and the agitation
he has thrown mine into is too
alarming for me to run the hazard
of seeing him again. She so far
conquered her inclination as to
refrain visiting <HI>Silvis</HI> for several
days; feigning not to be well,
to avoid suspicion of the cause;
but absent from her sight, he was
still present in her imaginati∣on.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143"/>
SHE sought to indulge her me∣lancholy
thoughts in solitude;
and Signiora <HI>Becarelli▪</HI> her father,
who lived at <HI>Bologna,</HI> and came
frequently to see his daughter,
was surprized and uneasy at the
alteration he observed. After
near a fortnight's restraint, pas∣sing
by <HI>Silvis's</HI> apartment, when
the door happened to be open,
she entered involuntarily. He
was lying on the bed, and she per∣ceived
by the redness of his eyes,
and the sound of his voice, he
had been weeping.</P>
<P>THIS she attributed to grief
for her absence. Her boasted
self-denial was overset the mo∣ment
she was flattered with a
tender share in his remembrance,
and her heart irrecoverably lost.
What is it disturbs you <HI>Silvis?</HI>
she began, you seem oppressed
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
with sorrow! Madam, said he, I
am not yet so familiar with afflic∣tion
as to have it sit easy upon
me;—my misfortunes always
appear new! But, resumed the
marchioness, are you not ingeni∣ous
in seeking them yourself?—
O, no, replied the pilgrim. Fate
has crushed me with woes un∣sought,
and I confess, madam, I
no longer listen to the flatterer,
hope!</P>
<P>HERE they both fell into a
profound reverie.—The mar∣chioness
viewing all things
through the medium of passion,
was persuaded <HI>Silvis</HI> adored her.
—Whilst <HI>Silvis,</HI> regardless of
the deep-fetched sighs of the
young marchioness, contempla∣ted
the peculiar severity of a con∣finement
that retarded the
chance of meeting <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>—
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
able to renew the conversation,
the fair marchioness retired in
apparent discomposure. Con∣vinced
<HI>Silvis</HI> was infinitely dear
to her, sensibility encreased her
affliction.</P>
<P>WHICH ever way I turn, the
course of reflection, said she to
<HI>Eugenia,</HI> I find only fresh sub∣jects
for distress.—The most
poignant of all, is the weakness
of my own heart.—If I have
resigned my fate to the direction
of another,—every sigh I rob
him of, is an injury to my fame,
and a breach of connubial duty:
—consider, my dear <HI>Eugenia,</HI>
how many disgraceful circum∣stances
attend this infatuation.
—I am ignorant who <HI>Silvis</HI> is,
—a stranger whom I meet with
in a pilgrim's dress;—perhaps
of ignoble descent;—perhaps
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
worthy the preference I give him.
—One thing alone is certain,—
he will soon depart,—no more to
return!—Ah; fatal arrow,—
the wound thou gavest will
quickly be healed! But that
which this too amiable un∣known,
has imprinted on my
heart, is, alas! incurable!</P>
<P>SOME days passed without a
renewal of her visits; but as <HI>Sil∣vis</HI>
began to walk tolerably, he
thought it his duty to wait on
the marchioness; and could not
avoid remarking the alternate
changes of colour whilst he ac∣costed
her; he feared she was ill,
but respect kept him silent. She
obliged him to sit,—and after re∣garding
him attentively for some
moments, I fear we shall not
prevail with you to stay with us
much longer <HI>Silvis,</HI> said she, you
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
will soon be in a situation to tra∣vel;
but may I not hope before
you leave us, your complaisance
will oblige me with the real
name of him I wounded, and
for whose recovery I suffered so
great anxiety?</P>
<P>MADAM, replied <HI>Silvis,</HI> I am
an unfortunate man, undeserving
the obliging curiosity you are
pleased to express;—my birth
and fortune equally contracted.
—The meanness of my ap∣pearance
sufficiently indicates
that of my condition.—The
little you reveal, rejoined the
marchioness, implies there is
much more to be known.—If
your rank answers the dignity of
your appearance,—not many are
superior!—but since you may
have reasons for not revealing
your quality, at least favour me
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
with one mark of confidence?—
Is your heart engaged? This
question is not meant to entan∣gle
you in a circumstantial de∣tail,
that may explain more than
you intend;—but if you have
the least regard to my satisfac∣tion,
you ought to answer it sin∣cerely.</P>
<P>THE recollection of past hap∣piness,
drew a tender sigh from
<HI>Silvis.</HI>—Madam, replied he,
plaintively, I will confess I love!
—I despair!—and am destined
to a life of misfortune!—These
words confirming the marchio∣ness
in her error, she blushed,
and with downcast eyes, conti∣nued
silent a long while;—at
last,—You must depart <HI>Silvis,</HI>—
but will not absence teach you to
forget me? I will sooner for∣get
my own existence than the
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
remembrance of those favours,
madam, your goodness has ren∣dered
indelible!—Apprehend∣ing
a longer visit might be im∣pertinent,
—<HI>Silvis</HI> withdrew to
her apartment.</P>
<P>AH <HI>Silvis!</HI> said the marchio∣ness
when she found herself at
liberty to complain,—you aban∣don
me;—you are upon the
eve of departure;—and yet, if
appearances are not very deceit∣ful,
you love!—Why not then
find some pretence to prolong
your abode? Is it that unknow∣ing
of my folly, you dread the
strength of your own attach∣ment?
But fly, charming <HI>Sil∣vis,</HI>
fly! I consent to it.—Your
presence only augments my woes.
—Perhaps in ceasing to be∣hold,
—I may cease to love you!
—A flood of tears that could no
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
longer be restrained, obliged her
to remain some hours in her clo∣set,
nor did <HI>Silvis</HI> seek any occa∣sion
to see or speak to her of
some days;—but finding her
wound perfectly cured, he sought
the marchioness to take his hum∣ble
leave,—and thank her in the
most grateful terms for her hu∣mane
behaviour; adding that
the best testimony he could shew
of his gratitude, would be to
publish in all places where fate
should lead him, that her gene∣rosity
was equal to her merit and
beauty.</P>
<P>THE marchioness exerted all
her fortitude to conceal the vio∣lence
of her emotions in this
cruel moment.—Go—<HI>Silvis,</HI> said
she, accomplish your vows;—
be assured mine shall be inces∣santly
poured forth for your fe∣licity!
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
Saying he should set out
the next morning at day-break,
after again repeating his thanks,
he left the marchioness.</P>
<P>THE night was sultry,—
without undressing, <HI>Silvis</HI> had
thrown herself across the bed,
hoping by a short sleep, to be
more able to travel in the morn∣ing:
but the young marchioness
could not resolve to let him de∣part,
without saying once more
adieu! She went silently out of
her bed-chamber; the splendor
of a moonlight night, rendered
a candle unnecessary; and per∣haps
the reflexion that her blushes
would be concealed, should she
not be able to restrain some ten∣der
expressions, induced her not
to take one; she also was tempted
to present him with her picture;
that so endearing an evidence of
her regard, might bind her more
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
forcibly not to forget her.—
The curtains of the bed were
drawn up in sestoons. <HI>Silvis</HI> was
fast asleep, his hair in graceful
negligence, shaded his cheeks,
and his exquisite beauty recalled
to the marchioness's remem∣brance
the idea of <HI>Cupid,</HI> when
the imprudent <HI>Psyche</HI> gratified
her fatal curiosity. Ah <HI>Silvis,</HI>
said she, passionately regarding
him, wert thou really enamoured,
couldst thou enjoy such tranquil
slumbers on the eve of our sepa∣ration?
Can it be possible, that
in the moment thou art preparing
my lasting anguish, thou remain∣est
calm and undisturbed? Not
daring to wake him, she hung o∣ver
him “with looks of cordial
love,” whilst the pale light
that glanced through the win∣dows
served to discern the un∣paralleled
charms of the lovely
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
stranger.—What in nature is
there half so perfect? she ex∣claimed
in the softest tone of ad∣miration.
—Language fails in the
description of thy beauty! who
can resist its attraction!</P>
<P>THUS intoxicated with that
insidious passion which glided
imperceptibly through all her
veins, she dropped the miniature
painting into <HI>Silvis's</HI> pocket, an∣ticipating
his pleasing surprize
at finding an unhoped for favour,
so inestimably dear. She was
just going to withdraw, when,
impelled by the violence of her
passion, she could not forbear
pressing his lips with a parting
kiss, and throwing her arm round
him, sunk on his breast in a state
of forgetfulness.—But, O <HI>God!</HI>
what were her emotions when
she felt the stroke of a poinard,
and recognized the face of her
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
husband, the Marquiss <HI>Becarelli'</HI>
who only quitted her to wreak
his vengeance on <HI>Silvis;</HI> starting
at the noise, and terrified with
the impending danger, he en∣deavoured
to fly,—which the en∣raged
marquiss prevented by
stabbing him in the arm; and
preparing to repeat the blow▪
the two gentlemen who accom∣panied
him interposed, asking if
he recollected the plan they had
formed, which would be frus∣trated
by his rashness? They
then dragged <HI>Silvis</HI> up the stairs
of a tower, and fastened the
door.</P>
<P>THE unhappy marchioness,
fainting and weltering in the
blood that gushed from her
wound, was ordered by the mar∣quiss
to be conveyed and con∣fined
with rigid severity in her
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
apartment. It is not easy to con∣ceive
the horror of her situation
less anxious for her own fate, than
for his she loved, trembling lest
her husband should have sacri∣ficed
an innocent victim to the
transports of jealous fury; yet,
however impatient her desire of
information, forbearing to gra∣tify
it from the fear of having
her apprehensions confirmed;—
and a repugnance to trust any of
her servants, by some of whom
she knew she had been betrayed.
Nor was this suggestion a mis∣taken
one:—<HI>Eugenia,</HI> that girl
who had her unreserved confi∣dence,
was seduced by the mar∣quiss,
no impracticable attempt
when promises and pecuniary re∣wards
are employed, to inspect
the conduct of the marchioness
during his absence. He enjoined
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
her to write him a regular ac∣count
of all that passed, which
she had been punctual in per∣forming,
not omitting a syllable
of all her mistress's encomiums
on <HI>Silvis,</HI> and the extravagance
of her passion. Irritated to the
greatest degree, the marquiss se∣cretly
arrived, and <HI>Eugenia</HI> dex∣trously
concealed him for two
days, till he could meet with an
opportunity to detect his wife
with her gallant.</P>
<P>HIS first design was to have
her shut up in a religious house<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and to obtain an order for taking
possession of her estate, and for
criminal prosecution against <HI>Sil∣vis.</HI>
—But, no longer master of
his resentment, when he found
her lying by her lover's side, the
first transports of his wrath were
ungovernable. Imprisoned in a
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
lonely tower, the wretched <HI>Julia,</HI>
sinking under pain and misfor∣tune,
uncertain of her destiny;
—unassisted by the kind hand of
humanity;—undetermined how
to act, was in a state so deplo∣rable,
as must have awakened
pity in the breast of her most bit∣ter
enemy.—To reveal her sex,
seemed the most infallible means
of justifying the marchioness,
and obtaining liberty.—On the
point of desiring her guards to
acquaint the Marquifs <HI>Becarell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
she requested to speak to him, a
sudden reflexion that the very ex∣pedient
she used to prevent, might
hasten her destruction, checked
her voice: she feared the frantic
rage of a jealous husband who
had poinarded his wife, should,
when her innocence was demon∣strated,
punish the unhappy cause
of his error. That to avoid the
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
resentment of her family when
the affair was cleared up,—he
might be tempted to devote <HI>Ju∣lia</HI>
to perpetual imprisonment.—
These apprehensions led her to
think it the safest way to be de∣livered
into the hands of justice,
which would, at least, free her
from the marquis's authority.</P>
<P>SHE passed a very wretched
night.—They had dressed her
wound, and in searching her
pockets, found the marchioness's
picture, a fresh proof of guilt.—
<HI>Julia</HI> was excessively astonished,
at the sight of a picture she had
no knowledge of, any more than
by what method it came into her
possession. Early the next morn∣ing,
she was hurried into a
coach, and surrounded by offi∣cers
of justice who insulted her
tears, as proofs of cowardice and
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
timidity, conveyed to a prison in
<HI>Bologna:</HI> here she gave vent to
her complaints.—Dear <HI>Hyp∣hyppolitus,</HI>
said she, with a deep
sigh, could fancy paint at this
very instant, your faithful <HI>Julia</HI>
loaded with irons,—in a pil∣grim's
dress—a fugitive from the
grasp of ruffians,—twice wound∣ed!
—stretched on the damp
floor of a dungeon! alas! what
would be your distraction?—
Ah! rather ought I not to be∣lieve
you have abandoned me.—
Ought I not indeed to be con∣vinced
your cruel silence can
proceed from nothing but decay
of affection.—And must I add
to all my other woes, the heartrending
idea that you love me no
more.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
THE marchioness was like∣wise
conducted to <HI>Bologna,</HI> and,
notwithstanding the pain her
wound occasioned, would actu∣ally
have been carried to the pub∣lic
prison, had not the influence
of her father, whose birth and
fortune gave him great conside∣ration
in the city, prevailed to
have her place of confinement
in a neighbouring castle.</P>
<P>AN adventure so extraordina∣ry,—the
rank of the persons
concerned,—made a great noise
in the world:—each side had
its partisans; but what corrobo∣rated
the allegations of the mar∣quiss
more than any other thing,
was the irresistable charms of
the fair pilgrim. Several ladies,
whose curiosity led them to the
prison, felt their hearts in du∣rance;
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
nor were there many
whose dispositions were not as
favourable towards <HI>Silvis,</HI> as those
of the fair marchioness.</P>
<P>YET, though few doubted
the reality of the crime she was
accused of, the credit of her fa∣ther
balanced the justice of the
cause; and he had engaged the
opinion of the most eminent
council, in favour of his daugh∣ter.
Hearing she would pro∣bably
be acquitted, the marquiss
was in the utmost perplexity;—
he was sensible the tryal would
go against him; unless his pro∣ceedings
was supported with pru∣dence
and vigour, which com∣menced
in a storm of rash im∣petuosity.
Under this embar∣rasment,
a thought struck him,
that he imagined might possibly
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
counteract the machinations a∣gainst
him,—he presented a
petition that, to avoid any im∣putation
of partiality, as he him∣self
was a foreigner, the judges
should be half <HI>Italians,</HI> and the
other half of his own country;
a division equally just and usual
in criminal causes. Count <HI>Ben∣tivoglio</HI>
the governor of <HI>Bologna,</HI>
undertook to find out persons of
acknowledged integrity, and the
father of the marchioness, as well
as her husband, depended abso∣lutely
on his promise.</P>
<P>THE city waited impatiently
the event of this interesting tryal,
and the governor, in complai∣sance
to the marchioness, ap∣pointed
it at the castle where she
was imprisoned.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163"/>
THE concourse of people of
fashion was greater than had
been seen on many occasions.—
The fair marchioness was dressed
in mourning, suitable to the so∣lemnity
of the day, which added
to her paleness caused by loss of
blood, as well as anxiety of mind.
Her beauty shone under the
black cloud that shaded it; when
her father, venerably graceful as
unfortunate, led her into the
court, accompanied by the rest
of his family.</P>
<P>SILVIS entered at another door
bending under the weight of fet∣ters,
which even in this deplo∣rable
state, all beholders thought
him more formed to impose than
to wear! Both cast themselves in
a supplicating attitude, their
eyes streaming with tears, at the
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
feet of their judges. I mean not
less to appeal to your justice, said
the marchioness, than to implore
your pity.—Alas, gentlemen,
I am unfortunate without being
guilty! I call <HI>Heaven</HI> to wit∣ness
my innocence! he who ac∣cuses
me with so much virulence
and so little respect and tender∣ness
to my character, builds his
assertions on weak and ill-ground∣ed
conjectures.</P>
<P>BEFORE <HI>Silvis</HI> could address
the judges, the marquiss <HI>Beca∣nelli,</HI>
advanced with the gentle∣men
who had found his wife in
<HI>Silvis's</HI> chamber; the miniature
painting in his hand; behold,
said he, an indubitable witness
of a criminal correspondence!—
a woman of virtue would never
have given her picture to a baseborn
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
pilgrim! nor will he dare
to deny we surprized her in his
arms.</P>
<P>SILVIS, to whom I shall now
restore her original name of <HI>Ju∣lia,</HI>
thunderstruck with his voice,
and lifting her eyes with terror
on her accuser, became pale,—
trembled,—and, at last, fainted.
Every one ran to her assistance▪
particularly a stranger, one of
her judges,—who instantly re∣collecting
her features, embraced
her with arduous delight!—
exclaiming O, <HI>Julia!</HI> adorable
<HI>Julia!</HI> is not this illusion! Can
it be that thou art again restored
to this fond heart, which so long
has wept and lamented thee in
the tomb!</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
THE whole audience regarded
the cavalier as insane! yet his
words animated the lifeless fair
one; she opened her lovely eyes,
and the first objects that caught
her returning senses, were her
dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and the earl of
<HI>Bedford!</HI> The universal cla∣mour,
—the repetition of the
name of <HI>Julia</HI> from every tongue,
—caused another of her judges
to descend from the bench.</P>
<P>WELCOME your darling child!
said <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> addressing him,
your <HI>Julia,</HI> my lord! The earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> pressed her to his
breast, in speechless extasy!—
Falling on her knees, she grasped
his hand with reverential duty,
whilst she moistened it with the
tears of affection! Now gazing
on her father;—now on <HI>Hyp∣politus!</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
Her soul was agi∣tated
with every tender, every
rapturous emotion!</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> sensa∣tion
was of a different nature.
The Marchioness <HI>Becarelli,</HI>—
her father,—Count <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI>
—and as many as could ap∣proach,
were eager to express
their congratulations, though the
cause was too intricate to be ea∣sily
comprehended.</P>
<P>JULIA, transported beyond
her accustomed moderation, su∣perior
to that timidity the sight
of the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had at first
inspired, declared in an audible
voice, she was the daughter of
the earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI>—The
judges immediately rose, and a
confused murmur of acclamations
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
succeeded;—but was soon hush∣ed
into profound silence, when
waving her hand, she added, that
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> the persecu∣tor
and husband of the Marchio∣ness
<HI>Becarelli,</HI> was likewise her
husband, and consequently had
two wives. A fact he could not
deny.</P>
<P>THUS the whole course of the
prosecution was changed, in fa∣vour
of the two ladies, who now
entered a process against the earl
of <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and
Signior <HI>Becarelli,</HI> demanded of
Count <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> that the earl
of <HI>Bedford's</HI> person might be se∣cured;
which, conformable to
the laws of the country, was
complied with, and the earl con∣conducted
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
to prison.—The par∣ticulars
he related, were as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>“THAT believing <HI>Julia</HI> dead,
from the letter wrote by the
abbess of St. <HI>Menoux,</HI> he left
<HI>England</HI> with an intention to
travel; beginning with <HI>Italy,</HI>
as a part of the world where
he had many relations on his
mother's side, with whom he
wished to be acquainted:—
Signior <HI>Beccarelli</HI> being of the
number, he went to visit him
at <HI>Bologna;</HI> where he saw
Signiora <HI>Becarelli,</HI> his daugh∣ter,
and became distractedly
in love;—his solicitations
gained her father's consent, on
condition of taking the name
and arms of his family.—
That sometime after his mar∣marriage,
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
he went with his
father-in-law to <HI>Florence,</HI>
where, one day at vespers, he
beheld <HI>Lucilla,</HI> accompanied
by a lady in a widow's dress,
whom he soon discovered to
be <HI>Julia,</HI> and thought he must
have dropped from his seat at
a rencounter so marvelous and
unexpected; that unwilling
to acquaint Signior <HI>Becarelli</HI>
with so unfortunate an event,
he applied his industry in cor∣rupting
a domestick of Sena∣tor
<HI>Alberti's,</HI> to assist in the
execution of a project he had
formed: that he afterwards
returned to <HI>Bologna,</HI> where he
remained some time with the
marchioness, but with a mind
restless and apprehensive left
<HI>Julia</HI> should, by some unlucky
chance, be informed of his se∣cond
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
engagement, and take
advantage of it to revenge the
confinement he had made her
endure.”</P>
<P>“THAT these considerati∣ons
prompted him to leave
the city, after first securing a
reception for <HI>Julia</HI> in a con∣vent
near <HI>Sienna,</HI> where he
intended to have shut her up
for life: but receiving intelli∣gence
from the servant in his
pay, that he had not a mo∣ment
to lose in eloping with the
fair <HI>English</HI> lady, whose lover
he concluded he was, because
his master, <HI>Alberti,</HI> had com∣manded
him to be ready that
very night, to take her out of
her apartment by force—
That on this information he
repaired with a party of his
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
servants masqued, and finding
the garden gate open, through
means of his emissary, placed
his wife in the coach without
molestation. But their flight
being soon retarded by the
pursuit of <HI>Alberti,</HI> he faced
the enemy, and received a pis∣tol
shot that made it necessary
for him to stop at <HI>Sienna;</HI>
where he constantly heard what
passed at his own house from
<HI>Eugenia,</HI> whom he employed as
a spy on the marchioness's
conduct: from her he learnt
that the marchioness was
strangely captivated with a
handsome pilgrim whom she
had lodged in the castle, and
that enraged with so gross an
indignity, he was incapable of
controuling his resentment.”</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
IN this desolate state, a prey
to rage and jealousy, the earl was
seized with a violent fever,
whose first symptoms were ex∣tremely
unfavourable.—The
wound received in the skirmish,
and which impatience to punish
the imaginary wrong done to his
honour, made him neglect, broke
out again.</P>
<P>BUT whilst he was thus tor∣mented,
the earl of <HI>Warwick,
Hyppolitus,</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> tasted all
the satisfaction that can be con∣ceived
in a situation so agreeable
to their wishes. The happy pair
reciprocally recounted their me∣lancholy
adventures, mutually
shedding tears for each others
sufferings, and hardly persuading
themselves to credit the reality
of their present happiness. No
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
words, my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> said <HI>Hyp∣politus,</HI>
can give you the least
idea of the agonizing torture I
endured by the fatal report of
your death.—To follow you
to the grave was the on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hope I
indulged; and it has always ap∣peared
to me since, that my de∣termined
resolution to seek death
in every place where danger
pointed, was the true reason that,
like a coward he fled my pur∣suit;
for I never received one
wound in the numerous engage∣ments
in the service of the knights
of <HI>Malta.</HI> Despairing therefore
of dying in the cause of religion,
and finding no diminution of my
sorrow, from the effects of time,
I resolved to pay a visit to my
sister, from the melancholy mo∣tive
of repeating with one who
loved her memory, the mourn∣ful
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
tale of fond affection? I
acquainted my two friends with
my intention. The earl of <HI>War∣wick</HI>
would accompany me, as
our honour was engaged to re∣new
the campaign, but as he had
been wounded in several actions,
rest was judged indispensibly ne∣cessary
for his health.</P>
<P>As to Lord <HI>Sussex,</HI> letters from
the countess of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in∣spired
him with hopes that their
union would not be much longer
retarded; and the sincerity of
his passion urged him instantly
to embark for <HI>England.</HI> The
earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and I, remained
at <HI>Venice,</HI> till he thought him∣self
sufficiently recruited; but
the exercise of a carriage made
him so much worse, he was o∣bliged
to stop in this city, where
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
we soon were visited by Count
<HI>Bentivoglio:</HI> and as the Marquiss
<HI>Becarelli's</HI> adventure was the ge∣neral
topick of conversation, and
attended with intricate circum∣stances,
he brought us daily
something new relating to one or
other of the parties.—Alas!
could I ever have thought that
that pilgrim loaded with chains
in a horrible dungeon, was my
dear <HI>Julia!</HI> for whom my tears
flowed incessantly. By the care
of providence, however, the Mar∣quiss
<HI>Becarelli,</HI> or more properly
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> was induced
to demand, part of the judges
might be <HI>English,</HI> to counterba∣lance
the partiality of the <HI>Italians.</HI>
The governor requested us to be
of the number. Strange turn of
fate, that I, of all men, should
be appointed to sit in judgment
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
on the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> and you.—
You, whom I revere as my so∣vereign,
and him whom I as∣suredly
regard as my mortal e∣nemy!</P>
<P>THE rest madam, you know;
—but what you can never suf∣ficiently
comprehend is, the joy,
—the satisfaction,—the rapture
I have felt, ever since that for∣tunate
incident!</P>
<P>JULIA answered these effu∣sions
of a worthy heart, with the
most charming frankness; and
said every thing to convince
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> of her invariable at∣tachment,
and just sensibility of
a passion so constant and ten∣der.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178"/>
How shall I describe the con∣fusion
and grief of the marchi∣oness
<HI>Becarellli,</HI> when beholding
<HI>Julia,</HI> she could not forget her
weakness for <HI>Silvis?</HI> That ideal
charmer reigned so despotically
in her heart, she was truly an
object of commiseration!—I
blush to confess to you, addres∣sing
<HI>Julia,</HI> that I have suffered
more anguish from the annihila∣tion
of <HI>Silvis,</HI> than from all the
misfortunes of my life.—For
though I firmly resolved to see
him no more, and preferred death
to dishonour. There was a sa∣tisfaction
in reflecting he existed
in some part of the world, and
that we might one day meet a∣gain.
But this discovery renders
my singular calamity irremedi∣able.
I am consumed by the ar∣dour
of a chimerical flame!—
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
Indeed, my dear marchioness,
interrupted <HI>Julia,</HI> you will find
my heart disposed to give you all
its friendship, and I sincerely as∣sure
you <HI>Silvis</HI> did not love you
half so well as <HI>Julia</HI> does!—
The fair <HI>Italian</HI> was unable to
reply but by her sighs:—she
regarded <HI>Julia</HI> with looks ex∣pressive
of despair, and left the
room drowned in tears.</P>
<P>THE proceedings against the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> were carried on
with such vigour by the two no∣blemen,
that he already began to
tremble for the decree; which
encreased his malady to so great a
degree, that he was reduced to
the last extremity.</P>
<P>ON his information, resent∣ment
instantly subsiding in the
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
breast of his two wives, was suc∣ceeded
by pity. They had him
carefully removed to the castle,
and forgetting all their wrongs,
exerted themselves in performing
the duties of humanity in his last
moments, with a zeal and at∣tention
singularly generous and
noble.</P>
<P>HE expired a martyr to the
extravagance of his passions; and
soon after the Marchioness <HI>Be∣carelli</HI>
took an eternal leave of
her beloved <HI>Julia.</HI>—I am going,
said she, to separate myself from
you for ever; since I cannot be
your's, I never will be another's.
—But will bury my shame,
and my unhappy passion in a
convent!</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181"/>
JULIA repeatedly pressed her
to abandon this gloomy resolu∣tion.
—She remained inflexi∣ble,,
and was leaving her apart∣ment,—when,
hastily return∣ing,
do not refuse my last re∣quest?
Let me once more be∣hold
my conqueror? Resume
for a moment the habit that
charmed me?</P>
<P>As <HI>Julia</HI> was alone, and thought
none but themselves would see
what passed, she was complai∣sant
enough to indulge her re∣quest;
and, stepping into her
closet, soon appeared in her pil∣grim's
dress to the marchioness,
who was all impatience: the
first glance occasioned so violent
a tremour, she was near faint∣ing.—Alas!
she exclaimed, I
find it a poison, where I sought a
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
remedy! <HI>Silvis,</HI> adorable <HI>Sil∣vis!</HI>
Thou no longer existest
but in my heart! All that now
appears of thee, I regard as a
mere phantom, that neither flat∣ters
nor cures my passion!</P>
<P>WITH these words she rose
suddenly, and proceeded to the
convent she had chosen for her
retreat; where soon after, un∣moved
by the gentle entreaties
of her distressed father, she took
the veil.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick, Hyppo∣litus,</HI>
and <HI>Julia,</HI> having heard of
the death of <HI>Alberti,</HI> pursued
their journey to <HI>Florence,</HI> where
the mourning in which they
found their friends, gave place to
delightful sensations of joy, at
the sight that was dearest to them
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
on earth! <HI>Lucilla</HI> seemed quite
frantic; whilst she embraced her
<HI>Julia!</HI> The constant anxiety
that preyed upon her mind, ig∣norant
of the fate of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and her friend, had interrupted
the sweetness of that harmony
she enjoyed with a husband of
uncommon merit.</P>
<P>LEANDER and <HI>Lucilla</HI> petiti∣oned
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> no
longer to defer completing the
the happiness of their amiable
friends, whose nuptials were so∣lemnized
at <HI>Leander's</HI> country seat
Never did <HI>Phoebus</HI> gild a more
auspicious day;—never did <HI>Cu∣pid</HI>
inspire two lovers with a
higher sense of each others me∣rit!
—and never did <HI>Hymen</HI> light
his torch with greater compla∣cency
than to reward that con∣stancy
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
which remained invinca∣ble
to the severest trials.</P>
<P>THEIR arrival in <HI>England</HI> was
celebrated with every demon∣stration
of joy.—They found
the earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> married to the
lovely countess of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
and <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> under the title
of earl of <HI>Douglas,</HI> continued to
be admired as one of the most
accomplished and valiant gentle∣men
of the age.</P>
