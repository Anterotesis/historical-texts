<SALUTE>RESPECTED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your esteemed
favour of the 13th ultimo,
whereby it appeareth, that you have
perused those same Letters, the
which were delivered unto you by
my friend the reverend Mr. Hugo
Behn; and I am pleased to find you
think they may be printed with a
good prospect of success; in as much
as the objections you mention, I
humbly conceive, are such as may be
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
redargued, if not entirely removed—
And, first, in the first place, as touch∣ing
what prosecutions may arise from
printing the private correspondence
of persons still living, give me leave,
with all due submission, to observe,
that the Letters in question were not
written and sent under the seal of
secrecy; that they have no tendency
to the <HI>mala fama,</HI> or prejudice of
any person whatsoever; but rather
to the information and edification of
mankind: so that it becometh a sort
of duty to promulgate them <HI>in usum
publicum.</HI> Besides, I have consulted
Mr. Davy Higgins, an eminent at∣torney
of this place, who, after due
inspection and consideration, declar∣eth,
That he doth not think the said
Letters contain any matter which
will be held actionable in the eye of
the law. Finally, if you and I
should come to a right understanding,
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
I do declare <HI>in verbo sacerdotis,</HI> that,
in case of any such prosecution, I
will take the whole upon my own
shoulders, even <HI>quoad</HI> fine and impri∣sonment,
though, I must confess, I
should not care to undergo flagella∣tion:
<HI>Tam ad turpitudinem, quam ad
amaritudinem paena spectans</HI>—Second∣ly,
concerning the personal resent∣ment
of Mr. Justice Lismahago, I
may say, <HI>non flocci facio</HI>—I would not
willingly vilipend any Christian, if,
peradventure, he deserveth that epi∣thet:
albeit, I am much surprised
that more care is not taken to ex∣clude
from the commission all such
vagrant foreigners as may be justly sus∣pected
of disaffection to our happy
constitution, in church and state—
God forbid that I should be so un∣charitable,
as to affirm positively,
that the said Lismahago is no better
than a Jesuit in disguise; but this I
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
will assert and maintain, <HI>totis viribus,</HI>
that, from the day he qualified, he
has never been once seen <HI>intra templi
parietes,</HI> that is to say, within the
parish church.</P>
<P>Thirdly, with respect to what
passed at Mr. Kendal's table, when
the said Lismahago was so brutal in
his reprehensions, I must inform you,
my good sir, that I was obliged to
retire, not by fear arising from his
minatory reproaches, which, as I
said above, I value not of a rush;
but from the sudden effect produced
by a barbel's row, which I had eaten
at dinner, not knowing, that the said
row is at certain seasons violently ca∣thartic,
as Galen observeth in his
chapter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and lastly, with refe∣rence
to the manner in which I got
possession of these Letters, it is a cir∣cumstance
that concerns my own
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
conscience only; sufficeth it to say,
I have fully satisfied the parties in
whose custody they were; and, by
this time, I hope I have also sa∣tisfied
you in such ways, that the
last hand may be put to our agree∣ment,
and the work proceed with all
convenient expedition; in which
hope I rest,</P>
<CLOSER>respected sir,
your very humble servant,
<SIGNED>JONATHAN DUSTWICH.</SIGNED>
P. S. I propose, <HI>Deo volente,</HI> to have
the pleasure of seeing you in the
great city, towards All-hallow∣tide,
when I shall be glad to treat
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
with you concerning a parcel of
M S. sermons, of a certain clergy∣man
deceased; a cake of the
right leaven, for the present taste
of the public. <HI>Verbum sapienti,

<HEAD>To the Revd. Mr. JONATHAN
DUSTWICH, at—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours in course of post,
and shall be glad to treat with
you for the MS. which I have de∣livered
to your friend Mr. Behn; but
can by no means comply with the
terms proposed. Those things are so
uncertain—Writing is all a lottery
—I have been a loser by the works
of the greatest men of the age—I
could mention particulars, and name
names; but don't chuse it—The
taste of the town is so changeable.
Then there have been so many let∣ters
upon travels lately published—
What between Smollett's, Sharp's,
Derrick's, Thickness's, Baltimore's,
and Baretti's, together with Shan∣dy's
<PB N="xii" REF="10"/>
Sentimental Travels, the pub∣lic
seems to be cloyed with that kind
of entertainment—Nevertheless, I
will, if you please, run the risque of
printing and publishing, and you
shall have half the profits of the im∣pression
—You need not take the
trouble to bring up your sermons on
my account—No body reads sermons
but Methodists and Dissenters—Be∣sides,
for my own part, I am quite a
stranger to that sort of reading; and
the two persons, whose judgment I
depended upon in these matters, are
out of the way; one is gone abroad,
carpenter of a man of war; and the
other has been silly enough to ab∣scond,
in order to avoid a prosecu∣tion
for blasphemy—I'm a great loser
by his going off—He has left a ma∣nual
of devotion half finished on my
hands, after having received money
for the whole copy—He was the
soundest divine, and had the most or∣thodox
<PB N="xiii" REF="11"/>
pen of all my people; and I
never knew his judgment fail, but in
flying from his bread and butter on
this occasion.</P>
<P>By owning you was not put in bo∣dily
fear by Lismahago, you pre∣clude
yourself from the benefit of a
good plea, over and above the ad∣vantage
of binding him over. In the
late war, I inserted in my evening
paper, a paragraph that came by the
post, reflecting upon the behaviour
of a certain regiment in battle. An
officer of said regiment came to my
shop, and, in the presence of my
wife and journeyman, threatened to
cut off my ears—As I exhibited
marks of bodily fear, more ways than
one, to the conviction of the bye∣standers,
I bound him over; my ac∣tion
lay, and I recovered. As for fla∣gellation,
you have nothing to fear,
and nothing to hope, on that head—
There has been but one printer flog∣ged
<PB N="xiv" REF="12"/>
at the cart's tail these thirty
years; that was Charles Watson; and
he assured me it was no more than a
flea-bite. C—S—has been threa∣tened
several times by the House of
L—; but it came to nothing. If
an information should be moved for,
and granted against you, as the edi∣tor
of those Letters, I hope you will
have honesty and wit enough to ap∣pear
and take your trial—If you
should be sentenced to the pillory,
your fortune is made—As times go,
that's a sure step to honour and pre∣ferment.
I shall think myself hap∣py
if I can lend you a lift; and am,
very sincerely,</P>
<CLOSER>yours,

Please my kind service to your neigh∣bour,
my cousin Madoc—I have

sent an Almanack and Court-kalen∣dar,
directed for him at Mr. Sut∣ton's,
bookseller, in Gloucester,
carriage paid, which he will please
to accept as a small token of my
regard. My wife, who is very
fond of toasted cheese, presents her
compliments to him, and begs to

which he was so good as to send

DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>THE pills are good for nothing—I
might as well swallow snow-balls to
cool my reins—I have told you over and
over, how hard I am to move; and at
this time of day, I ought to know some∣thing
of my own constitution. Why will
you be so positive? Prithee send me an∣other
prescription—I am as lame and as
much tortured in all my limbs as if I was
broke upon the wheel: indeed, I am e∣qually
distressed in mind and body—As if
I had not plagues enough of my own,
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
those children of my sister are left me
for a perpetual source of vexation—what
business have people to get children to
plague their neighbours? A ridiculous in∣cident
that happened yesterday to my
niece Liddy, has disordered me in such a
manner, that I expect to be laid up with
another fit of the gout—perhaps, I may
explain myself in my next. I shall set out to∣morrow
morning for the Hot Well at Bristol,
where I am afraid I shall stay longer than
I could wish. On the receipt of this, send
Williams thither with my saddle-horse and
the <HI>demi pique.</HI> Tell Barns to thresh out
the two old ricks, and send the corn to
market, and sell it off to the poor at a shil∣ling
a bushel under market price.—I have
received a sniveling letter from Griffin,
offering to make a public submission and
pay costs. I want none of his submissions;
neither will I pocket any of his money—
The fellow is a bad neighbour, and I de∣sire
to have nothing to do with him: but
as he is purse-proud, he shall pay for his
insolence: let him give five pounds to
the poor of the parish, and I'll withdraw
my action; and in the mean time you
may tell Prig to stop proceedings.—Let
Morgan's widow have the Alderney cow,
and forty shillings to clothe her children:
but don't say a syllable of the matter to
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
any living soul—I'll make her pay when
she is able. I desire you will lock up all
my drawers, and keep the keys till meet∣ing;

MRS. GWILLIM,</OPENER>
<P>WHEN this cums to hand, be sure
to pack up in the trunk male that stands
in my closet, to be sent me in the Bristol

kept in my brother's chamber and
mine. The maids, having nothing to do,
may be sat a spinning. I desire you'll
clap a pad-luck on the wind-seller, and
let none of the men have excess to the

shit every evening before dark.—The
gardnir and the hind may lie below in the
landry, to partake the house, with the
blunderbuss and the great dog; and I
hope you'll have a watchfull eye over the

health, and hoping to hear the same from
you; and that you and Saul will take my
poor kitten to bed with you this cold wea∣ther.
—We have been all in a sad taking
here at Glostar—Miss Liddy had like to
have run away with a player-man, and
young master and he would adone them∣selves
a mischief; but the squire applied
to the mare, and they were bound over.
—Mistress bid me not speak a word of
the matter to any Christian soul—no more
I shall: for, we servints should see all
and say nothing—But what was worse
than all this, Chowder has had the mis∣fortune
to be worried by a butcher's dog,
and came home in a terrible pickle—
Mistriss was taken with the asterisks, but
they soon went off. The docter was sent
for to Chowder, and he subscribed a re∣pository,
which did him great service—

health, but sulky. The squire gave a∣way
an ould coat to a poor man; and
John says as how tis robbing him of his
parquisites.—I told him, by his agreement
he was to receive no vails; but he says
as how there's a difference betwixt vails

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>.
of Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>AS I have nothing more at heart than
to convince you I am incapable of forget∣ing,
or neglecting the friendship I made
at college, I now begin that correspon∣dence
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
by letters, which you and I agreed,
at parting, to cultivate. I begin it sooner
than I intended, that you may have it in
your power to refute any idle reports
which may be circulated to my prejudice
at Oxford, touching a foolish quarrel, in
which I have been involved on account of
my sister, who had been some time settled
here in a boarding-school.—When I came
hither with my uncle and aunt (who are
our guardians) to fetch her away, I found
her a fine, tall girl, of seventeen, with an
agreeable person; but remarkably sim∣ple,
and quite ignorant of the world.
This disposition, and want of experience,
had exposed her to the addresses of a per∣son
—I know not what to call him, who
had seen her at a play; and, with a confi∣dence
and dexterity peculiar to himself,
found means to be recommended to her
acquaintance. It was by the greatest ac∣cident
I intercepted one of his letters; as
it was my duty to stifle this correspon∣dence
in its birth, I made it my business
to find him out, and tell him very freely
my sentiments of the matter. The spark
did not like the stile I used, and behaved
with abundance of mettle. Though his
rank in life (which, by the bye, I am
ashamed to declare) did not entitle him
to much deference; yet as h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s behaviour
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
was remarkably spirited, I admitted him
to the privilege of a gentleman, and
something might have happened, had not
we been prevented.—In short, the busi∣ness
took air, I know not how, and made
abundance of noise—recourse was had to
justice—I was obliged to give my word
and honour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to-morrow morning
we set out for Bristol Wells, where I ex∣pect
to hear from you by the return of
the post.—I have got into a family of
originals, whom I may one day attempt
to describe for your amusement. My
aunt, Mrs. Tabitha Bramble, is a maiden
of forty-five, exceedingly starched, vain,
and ridiculous.—My uncle is an odd kind
of humorist, always on the fret, and so
unpleasant in his manner, that rather
than be obliged to keep him company,
I'd resign all claim to the inheritance of
his estate.—Indeed his being tortured by
the gout may have soured his temper,
and, perhaps, I may like him better on
further acquaintance: certain it is, all his
servants and neighbours in the country,
are fond of him, even to a degree of en∣thusiasm,
the reason of which I cannot as
yet comprehend. Remember me to
Griffy Price, Gwyn, Mansel, Basset, and
all the rest of my old Cambrian compa∣nions.

<OPENER>To Mrs. JERMYN, at her house in

DEAR MADAM,</OPENER>
<P>HAVING no mother of my own, I
hope you will give me leave to disburthen
my poor heart to you, who have always
acted the part of a kind parent to me,
ever since I was put under your care.—In∣deed,
and indeed, my worthy governess
may believe me, when I assure her, that I
never harboured a thought that was
otherwise than virtuous; and, if God will
give me grace, I shall never behave so as
to cast a reflection on the care you have
taken in my education. I confess I have
given just cause of offence by my want
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
of prudence and experience. I ought not
to have listened to what the young man
said; and it was my duty to have told
you all that passed, but I was ashamed to
mention it; and then he behaved so mo∣dest
and respectful, and seemed to be so
melancholy and timorous, that I could
not find in my heart to do any thing that
should make him miserable and desperate.
As for familiarities, I do declare, I never
once allowed him the favour of a salute;
and as to the few letters that passed be∣tween
us, they are all in my uncle's
hands, and I hope they contain nothing
contrary to innocence and honour.—I am
still persuaded that he is not what he ap∣pears
to be: but time will discover—
mean while I will endeavour to forget a
connexion, which is so displeasing to my
family. I have cried without ceasing, and
have not tasted any thing but tea, since I
was hurried away from you; nor did I
once close my eyes for three nights run∣ning.
—My aunt continues to chide me
severely when we are by ourselves; but I
hope to soften her in time, by humility
and submission.—My uncle, who was so
dreadfully passionate in the beginning,
has been moved by my tears and distress;
and is now all tenderness and compassion;
and my brother is reconciled to me, on

MY DEAREST LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I AM in such a fright, lest this should
not come safe to hand by the convey∣ance
of Jarvis the carrier, that I beg
you will write me, on the receipt of it,
directing to me, under cover, to Mrs.
Winifred Jenkins, my aunt's maid, who
is a good girl, and has been so kind to me
in my affliction, that I have made her my
confidant; as for Jarvis, he was very shy
of taking charge of my letter and the lit∣tle
parcel, because his sister Sally had like
to have lost her place on my account: in∣deed
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>
I cannot blame the man for his cau∣tion;
but I have made it worth his while.
—My dear companion and bed-fellow, it
is a grievous addition to my other misfor∣tunes,
that I am deprived of your agree∣able
company and conversation, at a time
when I need so much the comfort of your
good humour and good sense; but, I
hope, the friendship we contracted at
boarding-school, will last for life—I
doubt not but on my side it will daily in∣crease
and improve, as I gain experience,
and learn to know the value of a true
friend.—O, my dear Letty! what shall I
say about poor Mr. Wilson? I have pro∣mised
to break off all correspondence,
and, if possible, to forget him: but,
alas! I begin to perceive that will not
be in my power. As it is by no means
proper that the picture should remain in
my hands, lest it should be the occasion
of more mischief, I have sent it to you
by this opportunity, begging you will
either keep it safe till better times, or re∣turn
it to Mr. Wilson himself, who, I sup∣pose,
will make it his business to see you
at the usual place. If he should be low-spirited
at my sending back his picture,
you may tell him I have no occasion for
a picture, while the original continues en∣graved
on my—But no; I would not
<PB N="13" REF="26"/>
have you tell him that neither; because
there must be an end of our correspon∣dence
—I wish he may forget me, for the
sake of his own peace; and yet if he
should, he must be a barbarous—But
'tis impossible—poor Wilson cannot be
false and inconstant: I beseech him not
to write to me, nor attempt to see me for
some time; for, considering the resent∣ment
and passionate temper of my brother
Jery, such an attempt might be attended
with consequences which would make us
all miserable for life—let us trust to time
and the chapter of accidents; or rather to
that Providence which will not fail, sooner
or later, to reward those that walk in the
paths of honour and virtue.—I would of∣fer
my love to the young ladies; but it
is not fit that any of them should know
you have received this letter.—If we go
to Bath, I shall send you my simple re∣marks
upon that famous center of polite
amusement, and every other place we
may chance to visit; and I flatter myself
that my dear Miss Willis will be punctu∣al

DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE followed your directions
with some success, and might have been
upon my legs by this time, had the wea∣ther
permitted me to use my saddle horse.
I rode out upon the Downs last Tuesday,
in the forenoon, when the sky, as far as
the visible horizon, was without a cloud;
but before I had gone a full mile, I was
overtaken instantaneously by a storm of
rain that wet me to the skin in three mi∣nutes
—whence it came the devil knows;
but it has laid me up (I suppose) for one
fortnight. It makes me sick to hear peo∣ple
talk of the fine air upon Clifton-Downs:
how can the air be either agree∣able
or salutary, where the daemon of
vapours descends in a perpetual drizzle?
My confinement is the more intolerable,

melted—not that she's a fool—the girl's
parts are not despicable, and her educa∣tion
has not been neglected; that is to
say, she can write and spell, and speak
French, and play upon the harpsichord;
then she dances finely, has a good figure,
and is very well inclined; but, she's de∣ficient
in spirit, and so susceptible—and
so tender forsooth!—truly, she has got a
languishing eye, and reads romances—
Then there's her brother, 'squire Jery, a
pert jackanapes, full of college-petulance
and self-conceit; proud as a German
count, and as hot and hasty as a Welch
mountaineer. As for that fantastical
animal, my sister Tabby, you are no
stranger to her qualifications—I vow to
God, she is sometimes so intolerable, that
I almost think she's the devil incarnate
come to torment me for my sins; and
yet I am conscious of no sins that ought
to entail such family-plagues upon me—
why the devil should not I shake off these
torments at once? I an't married to Tab∣by,
thank Heaven! nor did I beget the
other two: let them choose another guar∣dian:
for my part, I an't in a condition
to take care of myself; much less to su∣perintend
the conduct of giddy-headed
boys and girls. You earnestly desire to
know the particulars of our adventure at
<PB N="16" REF="29"/>
Gloucester, which are briefly these, and I
hope they will go no further:—Liddy
had been so long cooped up in a board∣ing-school,
which, next to a nunnery, is
the worst kind of seminary that ever was
contrived for young women, that she be∣came
as inflammable as touch-wood; and
going to a play in holiday-time,—'sdeath,
I'm ashamed to tell you! she fell in love
with one of the actors—a handsome young
fellow that goes by the name of Wilson.
The rascal soon perceived the impression
he had made, and managed matters so as
to see her at a house where she went to
drink tea with her governess.—This was
the beginning of a correspondence, which
they kept up by means of a jade of a mil∣liner,
who made and dressed caps for the
girls at the boarding-school. When we
arrived at Gloucester, Liddy came to stay
at lodgings with her aunt, and Wilson
bribed the maid to deliver a letter into
her own hands; but it seems Jery had al∣ready
acquired so much credit with the
maid, (by what means he best knows)
that she carried the letter to him, and so
the whole plot was discovered. The rash
boy, without saying a word of the matter
to me, went immediately in search of
Wilson; and, I suppose, treated him with
insolence enough. The theatrical hero
<PB N="17" REF="30"/>
was too far gone in romance to brook
such usage: he replied in blank verse, and
a formal challenge ensued. They agreed
to meet early next morning and decide
the dispute with sword and pistol. I
heard nothing at all of the affair, 'till Mr.
Morley came to my bed-side in the morn∣ing,
and told me he was afraid my
nephew was going to fight, as he had
been over-heard talking very loud and
vehement with Wilson at the young man's
lodgings the night before, and afterwards
went and bought powder and ball at a
shop in the neighbourhood. I got up im∣mediately,
and upon inquiry found he
was just gone out. I begged Morley to
knock up the mayor, that he might in∣terpose
as a magistrate, and in the mean
time I hobbled after the squire, whom I
saw at a distance walking at a great pace
towards the city gate—in spite of all my
efforts, I could not come up 'till our two
combatants had taken their ground, and
were priming their pistols. An old house
luckily screened me from their view; so
that I rushed upon them at once, before
I was perceived. They were both con∣founded,
and attempted to make their
escape different ways; but Morley com∣ing
up with constables at that instant,
took Wilson into custody, and Jery fol∣lowed
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
him quietly to the mayor's house.
All this time I was ignorant of what had
passed the preceding day; and neither of
the parties would discover a tittle of the
matter. The mayor observed that it was
great presumption in Wilson, who was a
stroller, to proceed to such extremities
with a gentleman of family and fortune;
and threatened to commit him on the va∣grant
act.—The young fellow bustled up
with great spirit, declaring he was a gen∣tleman,
and would be treated as such;
but he refused to explain himself further.
The master of the company being sent
for, and examined, touching the said Wil∣son,
said the young man had engaged
with him at Birmingham about six months
ago; but never would take his salary;
that he had behaved so well in his pri∣vate
character, as to acquire the respect
and good-will of all his acquaintance, and
that the public owned his merit, as an
actor, was altogether extraordinary.—
After all, I fancy, he will turn out to be
a run-away prentice from London.—The
manager offered to bail him for any sum,
provided he would give his word and ho∣nour
that he would keep the peace; but
the young gentleman was on his high
ropes, and would by no means lay him∣self
under any restrictions: on the other
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>
hand, Hopefull was equally obstinate;
till at length the mayor declared, that if
they both refused to be bound over, he
would immediately commit Wilson as a
vagrant to hard labour. I own I was
much pleased with Jery's behaviour on
this occasion: he said, that rather than
Mr. Wilson should be treated in such an
ignominious manner, he would give his
word and honour to prosecute the af∣fair
no further while they remained at
Gloucester—Wilson thanked him for his
generous manner of proceeding, and was
discharged. On our return to our lodg∣ings,
my nephew explained the whole
mystery; and I own I was exceedingly
incensed.—Liddy being questioned on
the subject, and very severely reproach∣ed
by that wild-cat my sister Tabby, first
swooned away, then dissolving in a flood
of tears, confessed all the particulars of
the correspondence, at the same time giv∣ing
up three letters, which was all she had
received from her admirer. The last,
which Jery intercepted, I send you in∣closed,
and when you have read it, I dare
say you won't wonder at the progress the
writer had made in the heart of a simple
girl, utterly unacquainted with the cha∣racters
of mankind. Thinking it was
high time to remove her from such a
<PB N="20" REF="33"/>
dangerous connexion, I carried her off the
very next day to Bristol; but the poor
creature was so frightened and fluttered,
by our threats and expostulations, that
she fell sick the fourth day after our arri∣val
at Clifton, and continued so ill for a
whole week, that her life was despaired
of. It was not till yesterday that Dr.
Rigge declared her out of danger. You
cannot imagine what I have suffered,
partly from the indiscretion of this poor
child, but much more from the fear of
losing her entirely. This air is intolera∣bly
cold, and the place quite solitary—
I never go down to the well without re∣turning
low-spirited; for there I meet
with half a dozen poor emaciated crea∣tures,
with ghostly looks, in the last stage
of a consumption, who have made shift
to linger through the winter, like so
many exotic plants languishing in a hot-house;
but, in all appearance, will drop
into their graves before the sun has
warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of
this ungenial spring.—If you think the
Bath water will be of any service to me, I
will go thither as soon as my niece can
bear the motion of the coach.—Tell
Barns I am obliged to him for his advice;
but don't choose to follow it. If Davis
voluntarily offers to give up the farm, the
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
other shall have it; but I will not begin
at this time of day to distress my tenants,
because they are unfortunate, and cannot
make regular payments: I wonder that
Barns should think me capable of such
oppression—As for Higgins, the fellow is
a notorious poacher, to be sure; and an
impudent rascal to set his snares in my
own paddock; but, I suppose, he
thought he had some right (especially in
my absence) to partake of what nature
seems to have intended for common use—
you may threaten him in my name, as
much as you please, and if he repeats the
offence, let me know it before you have
recourse to justice.—I know you are a
great sportsman, and oblige many of your
friends: I need not tell you to make use
of my grounds; but it may be necessary
to hint, that I'm more afraid of my fowl∣ing
piece than of my game. When you

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus
college, Oxon.
Hot-well, <DATE>April 18.</DATE>
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>I GIVE Mansel credit for his inven∣tion,
in propagating the report that I
had a quarrel with a mountebank's merry
Andrew at Gloucester: but I have too
much respect for every appendage of wit,
<PB N="25" REF="38"/>
to quarrel even with the lowest buffoone∣ry;
and therefore I hope Mansel and I
shall always be good friends. I cannot,
however, approve of his drowning my
poor dog Ponto, on purpose to convert
Ovid's pleonasm into a punning epitaph.
—<HI>deerant quoque Littora Ponto:</HI> for, that he
threw him into the Isis, when it was so
high and impetous, with no other view
than to kill the fleas, is an excuse that
will not hold water—But I leave poor
Ponto to his fate, and hope Providence
will take care to accommodate Mansel
with a drier death.</P>
<P>As there is nothing that can be called
company at the Well, I am here in a
state of absolute rustication: This, how∣ever,
gives me leisure to observe the sin∣gularities
in my uncle's character, which
seems to have interested your curiosity.
The truth is, his disposition and mine,
which, like oil and vinegar, repelled one
another at first, have now begun to mix
by dint of being beat up together. I was
once apt to believe him a complete Cynic;
and that nothing but the necessity of his
occasions could compel him to get with∣in
the pale of society—I am now of an∣other
opinion. I think his peevishness a∣rises
partly from bodily pain, and partly
<PB N="26" REF="39"/>
from a natural excess of mental sensibility;
for, I suppose, the mind as well as the
body, is in some cases endued with a
morbid excess of sensation.</P>
<P>I was t'other day much diverted with a
conversation that passed in the Pump-room,
betwixt him and the famous Dr.
L—n, who is come to ply at the Well
for patients. My uncle was complaining
of the stink, occasioned by the vast quan∣tity
of mud and slime, which the river
leaves at low ebb under the windows of
the Pump-room. He observed, that the
exhalations arising from such a nuisance,
could not but be prejudicial to the weak
lungs of many consumptive patients, who
came to drink the water. The Doctor
overhearing this remark, made up to
him, and assured him he was mistaken.
He said, people in general were so mis∣led
by vulgar prejudices, that philoso∣phy
was hardly sufficient to undeceive
them. Then humming thrice, he assum∣ed
a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect,
and entered into a learned investigation
of the nature of stink. He observed,
that stink, or stench, meant no more than
a strong impression on the olfactory
nerves; and might be applied to substan∣ces
of the most opposite qualities; that
<PB N="27" REF="40"/>
in the Dutch language, <HI>stinken</HI> signified
the most agreeable perfume, as well as the
most fetid odour, as appears in Van Vlou∣del's
translation of Horace, in that beau∣tiful
ode, <HI>Quis multa gracilis,</HI> &amp;c.—The
words <HI>liquidis perfusus od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribus,</HI> he trans∣lates
<HI>van civet &amp; m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schata gestinken:</HI> that
individuals differed <HI>toto caelo</HI> in their
opinion of smells, which, indeed, was al∣together
as arbitrary as the opinion of
beauty; that the French were pleased
with the putrid effluvia of animal food;
and so were the Hottentots in Africa, and
the Savages in Greenland; and that the
Negroes on the coast of Senegal would
not touch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish till it was rotten; strong
presumptions in favour of what is gene∣rally
called <HI>stink,</HI> as those nations are in a
state of nature, undebauched by luxury,
unseduced by whim and caprice: that he
had reason to believe the stercoraceous fla∣vour,
condemned by prejudice as a stink,
was, in fact, most agreeable to the or∣gans
of smelling; for, that every person
who pretended to nauseate the smell of
another's excretions, snuffed up his own
with particular complacency; for the
truth of which he appealed to all the la∣dies
and gentlemen then present: he said,
the inhabitants of Madrid and Edin∣burgh
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
found particular satisfaction in
breathing their own atmosphere, which
was always impregnated with stercora∣ceous
effluvia: that the learned Dr. B—,
in his treatise on the Four Digestions, ex∣plains
in what manner the volatile efflu∣via
from the intestines, stimulate and
promote the operations of the animal
oeconomy: he affirmed, the last Grand
Duke of Tuscany, of the <HI>Medicis</HI> family,
who refined upon sensuality with the spi∣rit
of a philosopher, was so delighted
with that odour, that he caused the es∣sence
of ordure to be extracted, and used
it as the most delicious perfume: that he
himself, (the doctor) when he happened
to be low-spirited, or fatigued with busi∣ness,
found immediate relief and uncom∣mon
satisfaction from hanging over the
stale contents of a close-stool, while his
servant stirred it about under his nose;
nor was this effect to be wondered at,
when we consider that this substance
abounds with the self-same volatile salts
that are so greedily smelled to by the
most delicate invalids, after they have
been extracted and sublimed by the che∣mists.—By
this time the company be∣gan
to hold their noses; but the doctor,
without taking the least notice of this sig∣nal,
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
proceeded to shew, that many fetid
substances were not only agreeable but
salutary; such as <HI>assafetida,</HI> and other me∣dicinal
gums, resins, roots, and vegeta∣bles,
over and above burnt feathers, tan∣pits,
candle-snuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In short, he
used many learned arguments to persuade
his audience out of their senses; and from
<HI>stench</HI> made a transition to <HI>filth,</HI> which
he affirmed was also a mistaken idea, in
as much as objects so called, were no other
than certain modifications of matter, con∣sisting
of the same principles that enter in∣to
the composition of all created essences,
whatever they may be: that in the
filthiest production of nature, a philoso∣pher
considered nothing but the earth,
water, salt, and air of which it was com∣pounded;
that, for his own part, he had
no more objection to drinking the dirtiest
ditch water, than he had to a glass of wa∣ter
from the Hot Well, provided he was
assured there was nothing poisonous in
the concrete. Then addressing himself
to my uncle, “Sir, (said he) you seem
to be of a dropsical habit, and proba∣bly
will soon have a confirmed <HI>ascites:</HI>
if I should be present when you are
tapped, I will give you a convincing
proof of what I assert, by drinking
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
without hesitation the water that comes
out of your abdomen.”—The ladies
made wry faces at this declaration, and
my uncle, changing colour, told him he
did not desire any such proof of his phi∣losophy:
“But I should be glad to
know (said he) what makes you think
I am of a dropsical habit?” “Sir, I
beg pardon, (replied the doctor) I per∣ceive
your ancles are swelled, and you
seem to have the <HI>facies leucophlegmatica.</HI>
Perhaps, indeed, your disorder may be
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ematous,</HI> or gouty, or it may be the
<HI>lues venerea:</HI> If you have any reason
to flatter yourself it is this last, sir, I
will undertake to cure you with three
small pills, even if the disease should
have attained its utmost inveteracy.
Sir, it is an arcanum which I have dis∣covered,
and prepared with infinite la∣bour.—Sir,
I have lately cured a wo∣man
in Bristol—a common prostitute,
sir, who had got all the worst symp∣toms
of the disorder; such as <HI>nodi, to∣phi,</HI>
and <HI>gummata, verrucae, cristae
Galli,</HI> and a <HI>serpiginous</HI> eruption, or
rather a pocky itch all over her body.
—By that time she had taken the
second pill, sir, by Heaven! she was
as smooth as my hand, and the third
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
made her as sound and as fresh as a
new born infant.” “Sir, (cried my
uncle peevishly) I have no reason to
flatter myself that my disorder comes
within the efficacy of your nost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.
But, this patient you talk of, may not
be so sound at bottom as you ima∣gine.”
“I can't possibly be mistaken:
(rejoined the philosopher) for I have
had communication with her three
times—I always ascertain my cures in
that manner.” At this remark, all the
ladies retired to another corner of the
room, and some of them began to spit.—
As to my uncle, though he was ruffled at
first by the doctor's saying he was dropsi∣cal,
he could not help smiling at this ri∣diculous
confession, and, I suppose, with
a view to punish this original, told him
there was a wart upon his nose, that
looked a little suspicious. “I don't pre∣tend
to be a judge of those matters;
(said he) but I understand that warts
are often produced by the distemper;
and that one upon your nose seems to
have taken possession of the very key∣stone
of the bridge, which I hope is in
no danger of falling.” L—n seem∣ed
a little confounded at this remark, and
assured him it was nothing but a com∣mon
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
excrescence of the cuticula, but that
the bones w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e all sound below; for the
truth of this assertion he appealed to the
touch, desiring he would feel the part.
My uncle said it was a matter of such de∣licacy
to meddle with a gentleman's nose,
that he declined the office—upon which,
the Doctor turning to me, intreated me
to do him that favour. I complied with
his request, and handled it so roughly,
that he sneezed, and the tears ran down
his cheeks, to the no small entertainment
of the company, and particularly of my
uncle, who burst out a-laughing for the
first time since I have been with him;
and took notice, that the part seemed to
be very tender. “Sir, (cried the Doc∣tor)
it is naturally a tender part; but
to remove all possibility of doubt, I
will take off the wart this very
night.”</P>
<P>So saying, he bowed with great solem∣nity
all round, and retired to his own
lodgings, where he applied caustic to the
wart; but it spread in such a manner as
to produce a considerable inflammation,
attended with an enormous swelling; so
that when he next appeared, his whole
face was overshadowed by this tremen∣dous
nozzle; and the rueful eagerness
<PB N="33" REF="46"/>
with which he explained this unlucky
accident, was ludicrous beyond all de∣scription.
—I was much pleased with
meeting the original of a character, which
you and I have often laughed at in de∣scription;
and what surprizes me very
much, I find the features in the picture,
which has been drawn for him, rather
softened than over-charged.—</P>
<P>As I have something else to say; and
this letter has run to an unconscionable
length, I shall now give you a little re∣spite,
and trouble you again by the very

Jesus college, Oxon.
Hot Well, <DATE>April 20.</DATE>
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I NOW sit down to execute the
threat in the tail of my last. The truth
is, I am big with the secret, and long to
be delivered. It relates to my guardian,
who, you know, is at present our prin∣cipal
object in view.</P>
<P>T'other day, I thought I had detected
him in such a state of frailty, as would
but ill become his years and character.
There is a decent sort of a woman, not
disagreeable in her person, that comes to
the Well, with a poor emaciated child,
far gone in a consumption. I had caught
my uncle's eyes several times directed to
this person, with a very suspicious ex∣pression
in them, and every time he saw
himself observed, he hastily withdrew
them, with evident marks of confusion—
I resolved to watch him more narrowly,
<PB N="35" REF="48"/>
and saw him speaking to her privately in
a corner of the walk. At length, going
down to the Well one day, I met her
half way up the hill to Clifton, and
could not help suspecting she was going
to our lodgings by appointment, as it was
about one o'clock, the hour when my
sister and I are generally at the Pump-room.
—This notion exciting my curiosi∣ty,
I returned by a back way, and got
unperceived into my own chamber, which
is contiguous to my uncle's apartment.
Sure enough, the woman was introduced,
but not into his bed-chamber; he gave
her audience in a parlour; so that I was
obliged to shift my station to another
room, where, however, there was a small
chink in the partition, through which I
could perceive what passed—My uncle,
though a little lame, rose up when she
came in, and setting a chair for her, de∣sired
she would sit down: then he asked
if she would take a dish of chocolate,
which she declined, with much acknow∣ledgment.
After a short pause, he said,
in a croaking tone of voice, which con∣founded
me not a little, “Madam, I am
truly concerned for your misfortunes;
and if this trifle can be of any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to you, I beg you will accept it with∣out
<PB N="36" REF="49"/>
ceremony.” So saying, he put a
bit of paper into her hand, which she
opening with great trepidation, exclaim∣ed
in an extacy, “Twenty pounds! O,
sir!” and sinking down upon a settee,
fainted away—Frightened at this fit, and,
I suppose, afraid of calling for assistance,
lest her situation should give rise to un∣favourable
conjectures, he ran about the
room in distraction, making frightful
grimaces; and, at length, had recollec∣tion
enough to throw a little water in her
face; by which application she was
brought to herself: but, then her feeling
took another turn. She shed a flood of
tears, and cried aloud, “I know not
who you are: but, sure—worthy
sir!—generous sir!—the distress of me
and my poor dying child—Oh! if the
widow's prayers—if the orphan's tears
of gratitude can ought avail—gracious
Providence!—Blessings! shower down
eternal blessings—” Here she was in∣terrupted
by my uncle, who muttered in
a voice still more and more discordant,
“For Heaven's sake be quiet, madam—
consider—the people of the house—
'sdeath! can't you—” All this time
she was struggling to throw herself on her
knees, while he seizing her by the wrists,
<PB N="37" REF="50"/>
endeavoured to seat her upon the settee,
saying, “Pr'ythee—good now—hold
your tongue—” At that instant, who
should burst into the room but our aunt
Tabby! of all antiquated maidens the
most diabolically capricious—Ever pry∣ing
into other people's affairs, she had
seen the woman enter, and followed her
to the door, where she stood listening,
but probably could hear nothing distinc∣ly,
except my uncle's last exclamation;
at which she bounced into the parlour in
a violent rage, that dyed the tip of her
nose of a purple hue,—“Fy upon you,
Matt! (cried she) what doings are
these, to disgrace your own character,
and disparage your family?—” Then,
snatching the bank-note out of the stran∣ger's
hand, she went on—“How now,
twenty pounds!—here is temptation
with a witness!—Good-woman, go
about your business—Brother, bro∣ther,
I know not which most to ad∣mire;
your concupissins, or your ex∣travagance!—”
“Good God, (ex∣claimed
the poor woman) shall a wor∣thy
gentleman's character suffer for an
action, that does honour to humani∣ty?”
By this time, uncle's indignation
was effectually roused. His face grew
<PB N="38" REF="51"/>
pale, his teeth chattered, and his eyes
flashed—“Sister, (cried he, in a voice
like thunder) I vow to God, your im∣pertinence
is exceedingly provoking.”
With these words, he took her by the
hand, and, opening the door of commu∣nication,
thrust her into the chamber
where I stood, so affected by the scene,
that the tears ran down my cheeks. Ob∣serving
these marks of emotion, “I don't
wonder (said she) to see you concerned
at the back-slidings of so near a rela∣tion;
a man of his years and infirmi∣ties:
These are fine doings, truly—
This is a rare example, set by a guar∣dian,
for the benefit of his pupils—
Monstrous! incongrous! sophistical!”
—I thought it was but an act of justice
to set her to rights; and therefore ex∣plained
the mystery—But she would not
be undeceived. “What! (said she)
would you go for to offer, for to ar∣guesy
me out of my senses? Did'n't I
hear him whispering to her to hold her
tongue? Did'n't I see her in tears?
Did'n't I see him struggling to throw
her upon the couch? O filthy! hide∣ous!
abominable! Child, child, talk
not to me of charity.—Who gives
twenty pounds in charity?—But you
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
are a stripling—You know nothing of
the world—Besides, charity begins at
home—Twenty pounds would buy me
a complete suit of flowered silk, trim∣mings
and all—” In short, I quitted
the room, my contempt for her, and my
respect for her brother, being increased in
the same proportion. I have since been
informed, that the person, whom my
uncle so generously relieved, is the wi∣dow
of an ensign, who has nothing to
depend upon but the pension of fifteen
pounds a year. The people of the Well-house
give her an excellent character.
She lodges in a garret, and works very
hard at plain-work, to support her
daughter, who is dying of a consump∣tion.
I must own, to my shame, I feel
a strong inclination to follow my uncle's
example, in relieving this poor widow;
but, betwixt friends, I am afraid of be∣ing
detected in a weakness, that might
entail the ridicule of the company

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
Hot Well, <DATE>April 20.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I UNDERSTAND your hint. There
are mysteries in physick, as well as in
religion; which we of the profane have
no right to investigate—A man must not
presume to use his reason, unless he has
studied the categories, and can chop lo∣gic
by mode and figure—Between friends,
I think, every man of tolerable parts
ought, at my time of day, to be both
physician and lawyer, as far as his own
constitution and property are concerned.
For my own part, I have had an hospital
these fourteen years within myself, and
studied my own case with the most pain∣ful
attention; consequently may be sup∣posed
to know something of the matter,
although I have not taken regular courses
of physiology <HI>et cete<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a et cetera.</HI>—In
short, I have for some time been of opi∣nion,
(no offence, dear Doctor) that the
sum of all your medical discoveries
<PB N="41" REF="54"/>
amounts to this, that the more you
study the less you know.—I have read all
that has been written on the Hot Wells,
and what I can collect from the whole, is,
that the water contains nothing but a lit∣tle
salt, and calcarious earth, mixed in
such inconsiderable proportion, as can
have very little, if any, effect on the ani∣mal
oeconomy. This being the case, I
think, the man deserves to be fitted with
a cap and bells, who, for such a paltry
advantage as this spring affords, sacri∣fices
his precious time, which might be
employed in taking more effectual reme∣dies,
and exposes himself to the dirt, the
stench, the chilling blasts, and perpetual
rains, that render this place to me intolera∣ble.
If these waters, from a small degree of
astringency, are of some service in the <HI>dia∣betes,
diarrhaea,</HI> and <HI>night sweats,</HI> when the se∣cretions
are too much encreased, must not
they do harm in the same proportion, where
the humours are obstructed, as in the <HI>asth∣ma,
scurvy, gout,</HI> and <HI>dropsy?</HI>—Now we talk
of the <HI>dropsy,</HI> here is a strange, fantasti∣cal
oddity, one of your brethren, who
harrangues every day in the Pump-room,
as if he was hired to give lectures on all
subjects whatsoever—I know not what to
make of him—Sometimes he makes
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
shrewd remarks; at other times, he talks
like the greatest simpleton in nature—He
has read a great deal; but without me∣thod
or judgment, and digested nothing.
He believes every thing he has read; espe∣cially
if it has any thing of the marvelous
in it; and his conversation is a surprizing
hotch-potch of erudition and extrava∣gance.
—He told me t'other day, with
great confidence, that my case was drop∣sical;
or, as he called it, <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phlegmatic:</HI>
A sure sign, that his want of experience
is equal to his presumption; for, you
know, there is nothing a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alagous to the
dropsy in my disorder—I wish those im∣pertinent
fellows, with their ricketty un∣derstandings,
would keep their advice
for those that ask it—<HI>Dropsy,</HI> indeed!
Sure I have not lived to the age of fifty-five,
and had such experience of my own
disorder, and consulted you and other
eminent physicians, so often, and so long,
to be undeceived by such a—But, with∣out
all doubt, the man is mad; and,
therefore, what he says is of no conse∣quence.
I had, yesterday, a visit from
Higgins; who came hither under the ter∣ror
of your threats, and brought me in
a present a brace of hares; which he
owned he took in my ground; and I
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
could not persuade the fellow that he did
wrong, or that I would ever prosecute
him for poaching—I must desire you will
wink hard at the practices of this rascal∣lion;
otherwise I shall be plagued with
his presents; which cost me more than
they are worth—If I could wonder at
any thing Fitzowen does, I should be
surprized at his assurance, in desiring you
to solicit my vote for him, at the next
election for the county: for him, who
opposed me on the like occasion, with
the most illiberal competition—You may
tell him civilly, that I beg to be excused.
Direct your next for me at Bath, whither
I propose to remove to-morrow; not only
on my own account, but for the sake of
my niece, Liddy, who is like to relapse.
The poor creature fell into a fit yester∣day,
while I was cheapening a pair of
spectacles, with a Jew-pedlar.—I am
afraid there is something still lurking in
that little heart of her's; which I hope a
change of objects will remove. Let me
know what you think of this half-witted
Doctor's impertinent, ridiculous, and ab∣surd
notion of my disorder—So far from
being dropsical, I am as lank in the belly
as a grey-hound; and, by measuring my
ancle with a pack-thread, I find the swel∣ling

<OPENER>To Miss LETTY WILLIS, at Gloucester.
Hot Well, <DATE>April 21.</DATE>
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I DID not intend to trouble you again,
till we should be settled at Bath; but
having the occasion of Jarvis, I could
not let it slip, especially as I have some∣thing
extraordinary to communicate—O,
my dear companion! What shall I tell
you? for several days past there was a
Jew-looking man, that plied at the Wells
with a box of spectacles; and he always
eyed me so earnestly, that I began to be
very uneasy. At last, he came to our
lodgings at Clifton, and lingered about
the door, as if he wanted to speak to
somebody—I was seized with an odd
kind of fluttering, and begged Win to
throw herself in his way: but the poor
girl has weak nerves, and was afraid of
his beard. My uncle, having occasion
for new glasses, called him up stairs, and
was trying a pair of spectacles, when the
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
man, advancing to me, said, in a whis∣per
—O gracious! what d'ye think he
said?—“I am Wilson!” His features
struck me that very moment—it was
Wilson, sure enough! but so disguised,
that it would have been impossible to
know him, if my heart had not assisted in
the discovery. I was so surprised, and so
frightened, that I fainted away; but soon
recovered; and found myself supported
by him on the chair, while my uncle was
running about the room, with the spec∣tacles
on his nose, calling for help. I
had no opportunity to speak to him; but
our looks were sufficiently expressive. He
was payed for his glasses, and went away.
Then I told Win who he was, and sent
her after him to the Pump-room; where
she spoke to him, and begged him in my
name to withdraw from the place, that
he might not incur the suspicion of my
uncle or my brother, if he did not want
to see me die of terror and vexation. The
poor youth declared, with tears in his
eyes, that he had something extraordina∣ry
to communicate; and asked, if she
would deliver a letter to me: but this she
absolutely refused, by my order.—Find∣ing
her obstinate in her refusal, he desir∣ed
she would tell me, that he was no lon∣ger
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
a player, but a gentleman; in which
character he would very soon avow his
passion for me, without fear of censure or
reproach—Nay, he even discovered his
name and family; which, to my great
grief, the simple girl forgot, in the confusi∣on
occasioned by her being seen talking to
him by my brother; who stopt her on the
road, and asked what business she had
with that rascally Jew—She pretended she
was cheapening a stay-hook; but was
thrown into such a quandary, that she for∣got
the most material part of the infor∣mation;
and when she came home, went
into an hysteric fit of laughing. This
transaction happened three days ago, dur∣ing
which he has not appeared; so that I
suppose he is gone. Dear Letty! you see
how Fortune takes pleasure in persecut∣ing
your poor friend. If you should see
him at Gloucester—or if you have seen
him, and know his real name and family,
pray keep me no longer in suspence—
And yet, if he is under no obligation to
keep himself longer concealed, and has
a real affection for me, I should hope he
will, in a little time, declare himself to
my relations. Sure, if there is nothing
unsuitable in the match, they won't be
so cruel as to thwart my inclinations—O
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
what happiness would then be my por∣tion!
I can't help indulging the thought,
and pleasing my fancy with such agree∣able
ideas; which, after all, perhaps,
will never be realised—But, why should
I despair? who knows what will happen?
—We set out for Bath to-morrow, and I
am almost sorry for it; as I begin to be
in love with solitude, and this is a
charming romantic place. The air is so
pure; the Downs are so agreeable; the
furze in full blossom; the ground enamel∣led
with daisies, and primroses, and cow∣slips;
all the trees bursting into leaves,
and the hedges already clothed with their
vernal livery; the mountains covered
with flocks of sheep, and tender bleating
wanton lambkins playing, frisking and
skipping from side to side; the groves
resound with the notes of black-bird,
thrush, and linnet; and all night long
sweet Philomel pours forth her ravish∣ingly
delightful song. Then, for varie∣ty,

walk so agreeable; the prospect so amus∣ing;
and the ships and boats going up
and down the river, close under the win∣dows
of the Pump-room, afford such an
enchanting variety of moving pictures, as
require a much abler pen than mine to
describe. To make this place a perfect

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus
college, Oxon.
Bath, <DATE>April 24.</DATE>
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>YOU have, indeed, reason to be sur∣prised,
that I should have concealed my
correspondence with miss Blackerby from
you, to whom I disclosed all my other
connexions of that nature; but the truth
is, I never dreamed of any such com∣merce,
till your last informed me, that it
had produced something which could
not be much longer concealed. It is a
lucky circumstance, however, that her
reputation will not suffer any detriment,
but rather derive advantage from the dis∣covery;
which will prove, at least, that
it is not quite so rotten, as most people
imagined—For my own part, I declare to
you, in all the sincerity of friendship,
that, far from having any amorous inter∣course
with the object in question, I ne∣ver
<PB N="51" REF="64"/>
had the least acquaintance with her
person; but, if she is really in the con∣dition
you describe, I suspect Mansel to
be at the bottom of the whole. His vi∣sits
to that shrine were no secret; and
this attachment, added to some good of∣fices,
which you know he has done me,
since I left <HI>Alma-mater,</HI> give me a right
to believe him capable of saddling me
with this scandal, when my back was
turned—Nevertheless, if my name can
be of any service to him, he is welcome
to make use of it; and if the woman
should be abandoned enough to swear his
bantling to me, I must beg the favour of
you to compound with the parish: I shall
pay the penalty without repining; and
you will be so good as to draw upon me
immediately for the sum required—On
this occasion, I act by the advice of my
uncle; who says, I shall have good-luck
if I pass through life without being oblig∣ed
to make many more compositions of
the same kind. The old gentleman told
me last night, with great good-humour,
that betwixt the age of twenty and forty,
he had been obliged to provide for nine
bastards, sworn to him by women whom
he never saw—Mr. Bramble's character,
which seems to interest you greatly, opens
<PB N="52" REF="65"/>
and improves upon me every day.—His
singularities afford a rich mine of enter∣tainment:
his understanding, so far as I
can judge, is well cultivated: his obser∣vations
on life are equally just, perti∣nent,
and uncommon. He affects misan∣throphy,
in order to conceal the sensibi∣lity
of a heart, which is tender, even to
a degree of weakness. This delicacy of
feeling, or soreness of the mind, makes
him timorous and fearful; but then he is
afraid of nothing so much as of disho∣nour;
and although he is exceedingly
cautious of giving offence, he will fire at
the least hint of insolence or ill-breeding.
—Respectable as he is, upon the whole,
I can't help being sometimes diverted by
his little distresses; which provoke him
to let fly the shafts of his satire, keen
and penetrating as the arrows of Teucer
—Our aunt, Tabitha, acts upon him as
a perpetual grind-stone—She is, in all re∣spects,
a striking contrast to her brother—
But I reserve her portrait for another oc∣casion.</P>
<P>Three days ago we came hither from
the Hot Well, and took possession of the
first floor of a lodging-house, on the
South Parade; a situation which my un∣cle
chose, for its being near the Bath, and
<PB N="53" REF="66"/>
remote from the noise of carriages. He
was scarce warm in the lodgings when he
called for his night cap, his wide shoes,
and flannel; and declared himself invest∣ed
with the gout in his right foot;
though, I believe, it had as yet reached
no farther than his imagination. It was
not long before he had reason to repent
his premature declaration; for our aunt
Tabitha found means to make such a cla∣mour
and confusion, before the flannels
could be produced from the trunk, that
one would have imagined the house was
on fire. All this time, uncle sat boiling
with impatience, biting his fingers,
throwing up his eyes, and muttering eja∣culations;
at length he burst into a kind
of convulsive laugh, after which he hum∣med
a song; and when the hurricane was
over, exclaimed, “Blessed be God for
all things!” This, however, was but
the beginning of his troubles. Mrs. Ta∣bitha's
favourite dog Chowder, having
paid his compliments to a female turn∣spit,
of his own species, in the kitchen,
involved himself in a quarrel with no
fewer than five rivals, who set upon him
at once, and drove him up stairs to the
dining-room door, with hideous noise:
there our aunt and her woman, taking
<PB N="54" REF="67"/>
arms in his defence, joined the concert;
which became truly diabolical. This
fray being with difficulty suppressed, by
the intervention of our own foot-man and
the cook maid of the house, the 'squire
had just opened his mouth, to expostulate
with Tabby, when the town-waits, in the
passage below, struck up their musick,
(if musick it may be called) with such a
sudden burst of sound, as made him start
and stare, with marks of indignation and
disquiet. He had recollection enough to
send his servant with some money to
silence those noisy intruders; and they
were immediately dismissed, though not
without some opposition on the part of
Tabitha, who thought it but reasonable
that he should have more musick for his
money. Scarce had he settled this knot∣ty
point, when a strange kind of thump∣ing
and bouncing was heard right over∣head,
in the second story, so loud and
violent as to shake the whole building.
I own I was exceedingly provoked at this
new alarm; and before my uncle had
time to express himself on the subject, I
ran up stairs, to see what was the matter.
Finding the room-door open, I entered
without ceremony, and perceived an ob∣ject,
which I cannot now recollect with∣out
<PB N="55" REF="68"/>
laughing to excess—It was a dan∣cing
master, with his scholar, in the act
of teaching. The master was blind of
one eye, and lame of one foot, and led
about the room his pupil; who seemed to
be about the age of three-score, stooped
mortally, was tall, raw-boned, hard-favoured,
with a woollen night-cap on
his head; and he had stript off his coat,
that he might be more nimble in his mo∣tions
—Finding himself intruded upon,
by a person he did not know, he forth∣with
girded himself with a long iron
sword, and advancing to me, with a pe∣remptory
air, pronounced, in a true Hi∣bernian
accent, “Mister What d'ye cal∣lum,
by my saoul and conscience, I
am very glad to sea you, if you are af∣ter
coming in the way of friendship;
and indeed, and indeed now, I believe
you are my friend sure enough, gra;
though I never had the honour to sea
your face before, my dear; for be∣caase
you come like a friend, without
any ceremony at all, at all—” I told
him the nature of my visit would not ad∣mit
of ceremony; that I was come to de∣sire
he would make less noise, as there
was a sick gentleman below, whom he
had no right to disturb with such prepos∣terous
<PB N="56" REF="69"/>
doings. “Why, look-ye now,
young gentleman, (replied this origi∣nal)
perhaps, upon another occasion,
I might shivilly request you to explain
the maining of that hard word, <HI>prepas∣terous:</HI>
but there's a time for all things,
honey—” So saying, he passed me with
great agility, and, running down stairs,
found our foot-man at the dining-room
door, of whom he demanded admittance,
to pay his respects to the stranger. As
the fellow did not think proper to refuse
the request of such a formidable figure,
he was immediately introduced, and ad∣dressed
himself to my uncle in these
words: “Your humble servant, good sir
—I'm not so <HI>prepasterous,</HI> as your son
calls it, but I know the rules of shivi∣lity
—I'm a poor knight of Ireland, my
name is sir Ulic Mackilligut, of the
county of Galway; being your fellow-lodger,
I'm come to pay my respects,
and to welcome you to the South Pa∣rade,
and to offer my best services to
you, and your good lady, and your
pretty daughter; and even to the
young gentleman your son, though he
thinks me a <HI>prepasterous</HI> fellow—You
must know I am to have the honour to
open a ball next door to-morrow with
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
lady Mac Manus; and being rusted in
my dancing, I was refreshing my me∣mory
with a little exercise; but if I
had known there was a sick person be∣low,
by Christ! I would have sooner
danced a hornpipe upon my own head,
than walk the softest minuet over
yours.”—My uncle, who was not a
little startled at his first appearance, re∣ceived
his compliment with great compla∣cency,
insisted upon his being seated,
thanked him for the honour of his visit,
and reprimanded me for my abrupt ex∣postulation
with a gentleman of his rank
and character. Thus tutored, I asked
pardon of the knight, who, forthwith
starting up, embraced me so close, that
I could hardly breathe; and assured me,
he loved me as his own soul. At length,
recollecting his night-cap, he pulled it off
in some confusion; and, with his bald∣pate
uncovered, made a thousand apo∣logies
to the ladies, as he retired—At that
instant, the Abbey bells began to ring so
loud, that we could not hear one another
speak; and this peal, as we afterwards
learned, was for the honour of Mr. Bul∣lock,
an eminent cow-keeper of Totten∣ham,
who had just arrived at Bath, to
drink the waters for indigestion. Mr.
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
Bramble had not time to make his re∣marks
upon the agreeable nature of this
serenade, before his ears were saluted
with another concert that interested him
more nearly. Two negroes, belonging to
a Creole gentleman, who lodged in the
same house, taking their station at a win∣dow
in the stair-case, about ten feet from
our dining-room door, began to practise
upon the French-horn; and being in the
very first rudiments of execution, produ∣ced
such discordant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds, as might have
discomposed the organs of an ass—You
may guess what effect they had upon the
irritable nerves of uncle; who, with the
most admirable expression of splenetic
surprize in his countenance, sent his man
to silence those dreadful blasts, and desire
the musicians to practise in some other
place, as they had no right to stand
there and disturb all the lodgers in the
house. Those sable performers, far from
taking the hint, and withdrawing, treat∣ed
the messenger with great insolence;
bidding him carry his compliments to
their master, colonel Rigworm, who
would give him a proper answer, and a
good drubbing into the bargain; in the
mean time they continued their noise,
and even endeavoured to make it more
<PB N="59" REF="72"/>
disagreeable; laughing between whiles,
at the thoughts of being able to torment
their betters with impunity. Our 'squire,
incensed at the additional insult, imme∣diately
dispatched the servant, with his
compliments to colonel Rigworm; re∣questing
that he would order his blacks
to be quiet, as the noise they made was
altogether intolerable—To this message,
the Creole colonel replied, that his horns
had a right to sound on a common stair∣case;
that there they should play for his
diversion; and that those who did not
like the noise, might look for lodgings
else-where. Mr. Bramble no sooner re∣ceived
this reply, than his eyes began to
glisten, his face grew pale, and his teeth
chattered. After a moment's pause, he
slipt on his shoes, without speaking a
word, or seeming to feel any further di∣sturbance
from the gout in his toes. Then,
snatching his cane, he opened the door
and proceeded to the place where the
black trumpeters were posted. There,
without further hesitation, he began to
belabour them both; and exerted himself
with such astonishing vigour and agility,
that both their heads and horns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>were bro∣ken
in a twinkling, and they ran howling
down stairs to their master's parlour-door.
<PB N="60" REF="73"/>
The 'squire, following them half way,
called aloud, that the colonel might hear
him, “Go, rascals, and tell your ma∣ster
what I have done; if he thinks
himself injured, he knows where to
come for satisfaction. As for you,
this is but an earnest of what you shall
receive, if ever you presume to blow a
horn again here, while I stay in the
house.” So saying, he retired to his
apartment, in expectation of hearing from
the West Indian; but the colonel pru∣dently
declined any farther prosecution of
the dispute. My sister Liddy was fright∣ed
into a fit, from which she was no
sooner recovered, than Mrs. Tabitha be∣gan
a lecture upon patience; which her
brother interrupted with a most significant
grin, exclaiming, “True, sister, God in∣crease
my patience and your discretion.
I wonder (added he) what sort of sonata
we are to expect from this overture,
in which the devil, that presides over
horrid sounds, hath given us such va∣riations
of discord—The trampling of
porters, the creaking and crashing of
trunks, the snarling of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs, the scold∣ing
of women, the squeaking and
squalling of fiddles and hautboys out
of tune, the bouncing of the Irish ba∣ronet
<PB N="61" REF="74"/>
over-head, and the bursting,
belching, and brattling of the French∣horns
in the passage (not to men∣tion
the harmonious peal that still
thunders from the Abbey steeple) suc∣ceeding
one another without interrup∣tion,
like the different parts of the
same concert, have given me such an
idea of what a poor invalid has to ex∣pect
in this temple, dedicated to Silence
and Repose, that I shall certainly shift
my quarters to-morrow, and endea∣vour
to effectuate my retreat before
Sir Ulic opens the ball with my lady
Mac Manus; a conjunction that bodes
me no good.” This intimation was by
no means agreeable to Mrs. Tabitha,
whose ears were not quite so delicate as
those of her brother—She said it would
be great folly to move from such agree∣able
lodgings, the moment they were
comfortably settled. She wondered he
should be such an enemy to musick and
mirth. She heard no noise but of his
own making: it was impossible to ma∣nage
a family in dumb-shew. He might
harp as long as he pleased upon her scold∣ing;
but she never scolded, except for
his advantage; but he would never be
satisfied, even tho'f she should sweat blood
<PB N="62" REF="75"/>
and water in his service—I have a great
notion that our aunt, who is now declin∣ing
into the most desperate state of celi∣bacy,
had formed some design upon the
heart of Sir Ulic Mackilligut, which she
feared might be frustrated by our abrupt
departure from these lodgings. Her bro∣ther,
eyeing her askance, “Pardon me,
sister, (said he) I should be a savage,
indeed▪ were I insensible of my own fe∣licity,
in having such a mild, compla∣cent,
good-humoured, and considerate
companion and house-keeper; but as I
have got a weak head, and my sense
of hearing is painfully acute, before I
have recourse to plugs of wooll and
cotton, I'll try whether I can't find
another lodging, where I shall have
more quiet and less musick.” He ac∣cordingly
dispatched his man upon this
service; and next day he found a small
house in Milsham-street, which he hires
by the week. Here, at least, we enjoy
convenience and quiet within doors, as
much as Tabby's temper will allow; but
the 'squire still complains of flying pains
in the stomach and head, for which he
bathes and drinks the waters. He is not
so bad, however, but that he goes in per∣son
to the pump, the rooms, and the
<PB N="63" REF="76"/>
coffee-houses; where he picks up conti∣nual
food for ridicule and satire. If I can
glean any thing for your amusement,
either from his observation or my own,
you shall have it freely, though I am
afraid it will poorly compensate the trou∣ble
of reading these tedious insipid let∣ters

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
Bath, <DATE>April 23.</DATE>
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>IF I did not know that the exercise of
your profession has habituated you to the
hearing of complaints, I should make a
conscience of troubling you with my cor∣respondence,
which may be truly called
<HI>the lamentations of Matthew Bramble.</HI> Yet
I cannot help thinking, I have some right
to discharge the overflowings of my
<PB N="64" REF="77"/>
spleen upon you, whose province it is to
remove those disorders that occasioned it;
and let me tell you, it is no small allevi∣ation
of my grievances, that I have a sen∣sible
friend, to whom I can communicate
my crusty humours, which, by retention,
would grow intolerably acrimonious.</P>
<P>You must know, I find nothing but
disappointment at Bath; which is so al∣tered,
that I can scarce believe it is the
same place that I frequented about thirty
years ago. Methinks I hear you say,
“Altered it is, without all doubt; but
then it is altered for the better; a truth
which, perhaps, you would own with∣out
hesitation, if you yourself was not
altered for the worse.” The reflection
may, for aught I know, be just. The
inconveniences which I overlooked in the
high-day of health, will naturally strike
with exaggerated impression on the irri∣table
nerves of an invalid, surprised by
premature old age, and shattered with
long-suffering—But, I believe, you will
not deny, that this place, which Nature
and Providence seem to have intended as
a resource from distemper and disquiet, is
become the very center of racket and dis∣sipation.
Instead of that peace, tranqui∣lity
and ease, so necessary to those who
<PB N="65" REF="78"/>
labour under bad health, weak nerves,
and irregular spirits; here we have no∣thing
but noise, tumult, and hurry; with
the fatigue and slavery of maintaining a
ceremonial, more stiff, formal, and op∣pressive,
than the etique<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te of a German
elector. A national hospital it may be;
but one would imagine, that none but
lunatics are admitted; and, truly, I will
give you leave to call me so, if I stay
much longer at Bath.—But I shall take
another opportunity to explain my senti∣ments
at greater length on this subject
—I was impatient to see the boasted im∣provements
in architecture, for which the
upper parts of the town have been so
much celebrated, and t'other day I made
a circuit of all the new buildings. The
Square, though irregular, is, on the whole,
pretty well laid out, spacious, open, and
airy; and, in my opinion, by far the
most wholsome and agreeable situation in
Bath, especially the upper side of it; but
the avenues to it are mean, dirty, dan∣gerous,
and indirect. Its communica∣tion
with the Baths, is through the yard
of an inn, where the poor trembling va∣letudinarian
is carried in a chair, betwixt
the heels of a double row of horses, win∣cing
under the curry-combs of grooms and
<PB N="66" REF="79"/>
postilions, over and above the hazard of
being obstructed, or overturned by the
carriages which are continually making
their exit or their entrance—I suppose af∣ter
some chairmen shall have been maim∣ed,
and a few lives lost by those acci∣dents,
the corporation will think, in ear∣nest,
about providing a more safe and
commodious passage. The Circus is a
pretty bauble; contrived for shew, and
looks like Vespasian's amphitheatre turn∣ed
outside in. If we consider it in point
of magnificence, the great number of
small doors belonging to the separate
houses, the inconsiderable height of the
different orders, the affected ornaments
of the architrave, which are both childish
and misplaced, and the areas projecting
into the street, surrounded with iron rails,
destroy a good part of its effect upon the
eye; and, perhaps, we shall find it still
more defective, if we view it in the light
of convenience. The figure of each sepa∣rate
dwelling house, being the segment of
a circle, must spoil the symmetry of the
rooms, by contracting them towards the
street windows, and leaving a larger sweep
in the space behind. If, instead of the
areas and iron rails, which seem to be of
very little use, there had been a corri∣dore
<PB N="67" REF="80"/>
with arcades all round, as in Co∣vent-Garden,
the appearance of the
whole would have been more magnificent
and striking; those arcades would have
afforded an agreeable covered walk, and
sheltered the poor chairmen and their car∣riages
from the rain, which is here al∣most
perpetual. At present, the chairs
stand soaking in the open street, from
morning to night, till they become so
many boxes of wet leather, for the bene∣fit
of the gouty and rheumatic, who are
transported in them from place to place.
Indeed this is a shocking inconvenience
that extends over the whole city; and, I
am persuaded, it produces infinite mis∣chief
to the delicate and infirm; even the
close chairs, contrived for the sick, by
standing in the open air, have their frize
linings impregnated, like so many spun∣ges,
with the moisture of the atmosphere,
and those cases of cold vapour must give
a charming check to the perspiration of a
patient, piping hot from the Bath, with
all his pores wide open.</P>
<P>But, to return to the Circus: it is in∣convenient
from its situation, at so great
a distance from all the markets, baths,
and places of public entertainment. The
only entrance to it, through Gay-street,
<PB N="68" REF="81"/>
is so difficult, steep, and slippery, that, in
wet weather, it must be exceedingly dan∣gerous,
both for those that ride in car∣riages,
and those that walk a-foot; and
when the street is covered with snow, as
it was for fifteen days successively this ve∣ry
winter, I don't see how any individual
could go either up or down, without the
most imminent hazard of broken bones.
In blowing weather, I am told, most of
the houses in this hill are smothered with
smoke, forced down the chimneys, by
the gusts of wind reverberated from the
hill behind, which (I apprehend likewise)
must render the atmosphere here more
humid and unwholesome than it is in the
square below; for the clouds, formed by
the constant evaporation from the baths
and rivers in the bottom, will, in their
ascent this way, be first attracted and de∣tained
by the hill that rises close behind
the Circus, and load the air with a per∣petual
succession of vapours: this point,
however, may be easily ascertained by
means of an hygrometer, or a paper of
salt of tartar exposed to the action of the
atmosphere. The same artist, who plan∣ned
the Circus, has likewise projected a
Crescent; when that is finished, we shall
probably have a Star; and those who are
<PB N="69" REF="82"/>
living thirty years hence, may, perhaps,
see all the signs of the Zodiac exhibited in
architecture at Bath. These, however
fantastical, are still designs that denote
some ingenuity and knowledge in the ar∣chitect;
but the rage of building has laid
hold on such a number of adventurers,
that one sees new houses starting up in
every out-let and every corner of Bath;
contrived without judgment, executed
without solidity, and stuck together, with
so little regard to plan and propriety,
that the different lines of the new rows
and buildings interfere with, and inter∣sect
one another in every different angle
of conjunction. They look like the
wreck of streets and squares disjointed by
an earthquake, which hath broken the
ground into a variety of holes and hil∣locks;
or, as if some Gothic devil had
stuffed them altogether in a bag, and left
them to stand higgledy piggledy, just as
chance directed. What sort of a mon∣ster
Bath will become in a few years, with
those growing excrescences, may be easily
conceived: but the want of beauty and
proportion is not the worst effect of these
new mansions; they are built so slight,
with the soft crumbling stone found in
this neighbourhood, that I should never
<PB N="70" REF="83"/>
sleep quietly in one of them, when it
blowed (as the sailors say) a cap-full of
wind; and, I am persuaded, that my
hind, Roger Williams, or any man of
equal strength, would be able to push his
foot through the strongest part of their
walls, without any great exertion of his
muscles. All these absurdities arise from
the general tide of luxury, which hath
overspread the nation, and swept away
all, even the very dregs of the people.
Every upstart of fortune, harnessed in
the trappings of the mode, presents him∣self
at Bath, as in the very focus of ob∣servation
—Clerks and factors from the
East Indies, loaded with the spoil of
plundered provinces; planters, negro∣drivers,
and hucksters, from our Ameri∣can
plantations, enriched they know not
how; agents, commissaries, and contrac∣tors,
who have fattened, in two successive
wars, on the blood of the nation; usur∣ers,
brokers, and jobbers of every kind;
men of low birth, and no breeding, have
found themselves suddenly translated into
a state of affluence, unknown to former
ages; and no wonder that their brains
should be intoxicated with pride, vanity,
and presumption. Knowing no other cri∣terion
of greatness, but the ostentation of
<PB N="71" REF="84"/>
wealth, they discharge their affluence
without taste or conduct, through every
channel of the most absurd extravagance;
and all of them hurry to Bath, because
here, without any further qualification,
they can mingle with the princes and no∣bles
of the land. Even the wives and
daughters of low tradesmen, who, like
shovel-nosed sharks, prey upon the blub∣ber
of those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>couth whales of fortune,
are infected with the same rage of display∣ing
their importance; and the slightest
indisposition serves them for a pretext to
insist upon being conveyed to Bath,
where they may hobble country-dances
and cotillons among lordlings, 'squires,
counsellors, and clergy. These delicate
creatures from Bedfordbury, Butcher∣row,
Crutched-Friers, and Botolph-lane,
cannot breathe in the gross air of the
Lower Town, or conform to the vulgar
rules of a common lodging-house; the
husband, therefore, must provide an en∣tire
house, or elegant apartments in the
new buildings. Such is the composition
of what is called the fashionable company
at Bath; where a very inconsiderable pro∣portion
of genteel people are lost in a
mob of impudent plebeians, who have
neither understanding nor judgment, nor
<PB N="72" REF="85"/>
the least idea of propriety and decorum;
and seem to enjoy nothing so much as an
opportunity of insulting their betters.</P>
<P>Thus the number of people, and the
number of houses continue to increase;
and this will ever be the case, till the
streams that swell this irresistible torrent
of folly and extravagance, shall either be
exhausted, or turned into other channels,
by incidents and events which I do not
pretend to foresee. This, I own, is a
subject on which I cannot write with any
degree of patience; for the mob is a
monster I never could abide, either in
its head, tail, midriff, or members: I
detest the whole of it, as a mass of igno∣rance,
presumption, malice, and bruta∣lity;
and, in this term of reprobation, I
include, without respect of rank, station,
or quality, all those of both sexes, who
affect its manners, and court its society.</P>
<P>But I have written till my fingers are
crampt, and my nausea begins to return
—By your advice, I sent to London a
few days ago for half a pound of Geng∣zeng;
though I doubt much, whether
that which comes from America is equal∣ly
efficacious with what is brought from
the East Indies. Some years ago, a friend
of mine paid sixteen guineas for two
<PB N="73" REF="86"/>
ounces of it; and, in six months after, it
was sold in the same shop for five shil∣lings
the pound. In short, we live in a
vile world of fraud and sophistication;
so that I know nothing of equal value
with the genuine friendship of a sensible
man; a rare jewel! which I cannot help
thinking myself in possession of, while I
repeat the old declaration, that I am, as
usual,</P>
<CLOSER>Dear Lewis,
Your affectionate

</LETTER>
<P>After having been agitated in a short
hurricane, on my first arrival, I have
taken a small house in Milsham-street,
where I am tolerably well lodged, for
five guineas a week. I was yesterday
at the Pump-room, and drank about
a pint of the water, which seems to
agree with my stomach; and to-mor∣row
morning I shall bathe, for the first
time; so that in a few posts you may
expect farther trouble; mean while, I
am glad to find that the inoculation
has succeeded so well with poor Joyce,
<PB N="74" REF="87"/>
and that her face will be but little
marked—If my friend Sir Thomas
was a single man, I would not trust
such a handsome wench in his family;
but as I have recommended her, in a
particular manner, to the protection of
lady G—, who is one of the best
women in the world, she may go thi∣ther
without hesitation, as soon as she
is quite recovered, and fit for service—
Let her mother have money to pro∣vide
her with necessaries, and she may
ride behind her brother on Bucks; but
you must lay strong injunctions on
Jack, to take particular care of the
trusty old veteran, who has faithfully
earned his present ease, by his past ser∣vices.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="75" REF="88"/>
<OPENER>To Miss WILLIS, at Gloucester.
Bath, <DATE>April 26.</DATE>
MY DEAREST COMPANION,</OPENER>
<P>THE pleasure I received from
yours, which came to hand yesterday, is
not to be expressed. Love and friend∣ship
are, without doubt, charming pas∣sions;
which absence serves only to
heighten and improve. Your kind pre∣sent
of the garnet bracelets, I shall keep
as carefully as I preserve my own life;
and I beg you will accept, in return, of my
heart-housewife, with the tortoise-shell
memorandum-book, as a trifling pledge
of my unalterable affection.</P>
<P>Bath is to me a new world—All is
gayety, good-humour, and diversion.
The eye is continually entertained with
the splendour of dress and equipage; and
the ear with the sound of coaches, chaises,
chairs, and other carriages. <HI>The mer∣ry
bells ring round,</HI> from morn till night.
Then we are welcomed by the city-waits
<PB N="76" REF="89"/>
in our own lodgings: we have musick in
the Pump-room every morning, cotil∣lons
every fore-noon in the rooms, balls
twice a week, and concerts every other
night, besides private assemblies and parties
without number—As soon as we were set∣tled
in lodgings, we were visited by the Ma∣ster
of the Ceremonies; a pretty little gen∣tleman,
so sweet, so fine, so civil, and polite,
that in our country he might pass for the
prince of Wales; then he talks so charming∣ly,
both in verse and prose, that you would
be delighted to hear him discourse; for
you must know he is a great writer, and has
got five tragedies ready for the stage. He
did us the favour to dine with us, by my
uncle's invitation; and next day 'squired
my aunt and me to every part of Bath;
which, to be sure, is an earthly paradise.
The Square, the Circus, and the Pa∣rades,
put you in mind of the sumptuous
palaces represented in prints and pictures;
and the new buildings, such as Princes∣row,
Harlequin's row, Bladud's-row, and
twenty other rows, look like so many en∣chanted
castles, raised on hanging terra∣ces.</P>
<P>At eight in the morning, we go in dis∣habille
to the Pump-room; which is
crowded like a Welsh fair; and there
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>
you see the highest quality, and the low∣est
trades folks, jostling each other, with∣out
ceremony, hail-fellow well-met. The
noise of the musick playing in the gal∣lery,
the heat and flavour of such a
crowd, and the hum and buz of their
conversation, gave me the head-ach and
vertigo the first day; but, afterwards, all
these things became familiar, and even
agreeable.—Right under the Pump-room
windows is the King's Bath; a huge
cistern, where you see the patients up to
their necks in hot water. The ladies
wear jackets and petticoats of brown li∣nen,
with chip hats, in which they fix
their handkerchifs to wipe the sweat from
their faces; but, truly, whether it is
owing to the steam that surrounds them,
or the heat of the water, or the nature of
the dress, or to all these causes together,
they look so flushed, and so frightful,
that I always turn my eyes another way▪—
My aunt, who says every person of fa∣shion
should make her appearance in the
bath, as well as in the abbey church,
contrived a cap with cherry-coloured rib∣bons
to suit her complexion, and obliged
Win to attend her yesterday morning in
the water. But, really, her eyes were so
red, that they made mine water as I
<PB N="78" REF="91"/>
viewed her from the Pump-room; and as
for poor Win, who wore a hat trimmed
with blue, what betwixt her wan com∣plexion
and her fear, she looked like the
ghost of some pale maiden, who had
drowned herself for love. When she
came out of the bath, she took assafoetida
drops, and was fluttered all day; so that
we could hardly keep her from going in∣to
hysterics: but her mistress says it will
do her good; and poor Win curtsies, with
the tears in her eyes. For my part, I
content myself with drinking about half
a pint of the water every morning.</P>
<P>The pumper, with his wife and servant,
attend within a bar; and the glasses, of
different sizes, stand ranged in order be∣fore
them, so you have nothing to do but
to point at that which you chuse, and it
is filled immediately, hot and sparkling
from the pump. It is the only hot wa∣ter
I could ever drink, without being
sick—Far from having that effect, it is
rather agreeable to the taste, grateful to
the stomach, and reviving to the spirits.
You cannot imagine what wonderful
cures it performs—My uncle began with
it the other day; but he made wry faces
in drinking, and I'm afraid he will leave
it off—The first day we came to Bath, he
<PB N="79" REF="92"/>
fell into a violent passion; beat two
black-a-moors, and I was afraid he would
have fought with their master; but the
stranger proved a peaceable man. To be
sure, the gout had got into his head, as
my aunt observed: but, I believe, his
passion drove it away; for he has been re∣markably
well ever since. It is a thou∣sand
pities he should ever be troubled
with that ugly distemper; for, when he
is free from pain, he is the best-tempered
man upon earth; so gentle, so generous,
so charitable, that every body loves him;
and so good to me, in particular, that I
shall never be able to shew the deep sense
I have of his tenderness and affection.</P>
<P>Hard by the Pump-room, is a coffee-house
for the ladies; but my aunt says,
young girls are not admitted, inasmuch
as the conversation turns upon politics,
scandal, philosophy, and other subjects
above our capacity; but we are allowed
to accompany them to the booksellers
shops, which are charming places of re∣sort;
where we read novels, plays,
pamphlets, and news-papers, for so small
a subscription as a crown a quarter; and
in these offices of intelligence, (as my
brother calls them) all the reports of the
day, and all the private transactions of
<PB N="80" REF="93"/>
the Bath, are first entered and discussed.
From the bookseller's shop, we make a
tour through the milliners and toy-men;
and commonly stop at Mr. Gill's, the
pastry-cook, to take a jelly, a tart, or a
small bason of vermicelli. There is, more∣over,
another place of entertainment on
the other side of the water, opposite to
the Grove; to which the company cross
over in a boat—It is called Spring Gar∣den;
a sweet retreat, laid out in walks
and ponds, and parterres of flowers; and
there is a long-room for breakfasting and
dancing. As the situation is low and
damp, and the season has been remark∣ably
wet, my uncle won't suffer me to go
thither, lest I should catch cold: but my
aunt says it is all a vulgar prejudice; and,
to be sure, a great many gentlemen and
ladies of Ireland frequent the place, with∣out
seeming to be the worse for it. They
say, dancing at Spring Gardens, when
the air is moist, is recommended to them
as an excellent cure for the rheumatism.
I have been twice at the play; where,
notwithstanding the excellence of the per∣formers,
the gayety of the company, and
the decorations of the theatre, which are
very fine, I could not help reflecting, with
a sigh, upon our poor homely represen∣tations
<PB N="81" REF="94"/>
at Gloucester—But this, in con∣fidence
to my dear Willis—You know
my heart, and will excuse its weak∣ness.—</P>
<P>After all, the great scenes of entertain∣ment
at Bath, are the two public rooms;
where the company meet alternately
every evening—They are spacious, lofty,
and, when lighted up, appear very strik∣ing.
They are generally crowded with
well-dressed people, who drink tea in
separate parties, play at cards, walk, or
sit and chat together, just as they are dis∣posed.
Twice a-week there is a ball;
the expence of which is defrayed by a vo∣luntary
subscription among the gentle∣men;
and every subscriber has three
tickets. I was there Friday last with my
aunt, under the care of my brother, who
is a subscriber; and Sir Ulic Mackilligut
recommended his nephew, captain O Do∣naghan,
to me as a partner; but Jerry
excused himself, by saying I had got the
head-ach; and, indeed, it was really so,
though I can't imagine how he knew it.
The place was so hot, and the smell so
different from what we are used to in the
country, that I was quite feverish when
we came away. Aunt says it is the ef∣fect
of a vulgar constitution, reared
<PB N="82" REF="95"/>
among woods and mountains; and, that
as I become accustomed to genteel com∣pany,
it will wear off.—Sir Ulic was very
complaisant, made her a great many
high-flown compliments; and, when we
retired, handed her with great ceremony
to her chair. The captain, I believe,
would have done me the same favour;
but my brother, seeing him advance,

<OPENER>To Mrs. MARY JONES, at Bramble∣ton-hall.
DEAR MOLLY JONES,</OPENER>
<P>HEAVING got a frank, I now return
your fever, which I received by Mr. Hig∣gins,
at the Hot Well, together with the
stockings, which his wife footed for me;
but now they are of no survice. No body
wears such things in this place—O Mol∣ly!
you that live in the country have
no deception of our doings at Bath. Here
is such dressing, and fidling, and dan∣cing,
and gadding, and courting, and
plotting—O gracious! if God had not
given me a good stock of discretion,
what a power of things might not I re∣veal,
consarning old mistress and young
mistress; Jews with beards, that were no
Jews; but handsome Christians, without
a hair upon their sin, strolling with spec∣tacles,
to get speech of Miss Liddy. But
she's a dear sweet soul, as innocent as the
child unborn. She has tould me all her
<PB N="84" REF="97"/>
inward thoughts, and disclosed her pas∣sion
for Mr. Wilson; and that's not his
name neither; and thof he acted among
the player-men, he is meat for their ma∣sters;
and she has gi'en me her yallow
trollopea; which Mrs. Drab, the manty∣maker,
says will look very well when
it is scowred and smoaked with silfur—
You knows as how, yallow fitts my fiz∣zogmony.
God he knows what ha∣vock
I shall make among the mail sex,
when I make my first appearance in this
killing collar, with a full soot of gaze, as
good as new, that I bought last Friday
of madam Friponeau, the French mulla∣ner
—Dear girl, I have seen all the fine
shews of Bath; the Prades, the Squires,
and the Circlis, the Crashit, the Hotto∣gon,
and Bloody Buildings, and Harry
King's row; and I have been twice in the
Bath with mistress, and na'r a smoak up∣on
our backs, hussy—The first time I
was mortally afraid, and flustered all day;
and afterwards made believe that I had
got the heddick; but mistress said, if I
didn't go, I should take a dose of bum∣taffy;
and so remembring how it worked
Mrs. Gwyllim a pennorth, I chose rather
to go again with her into the Bath, and
then I met with an axident. I dropt my
<PB N="85" REF="98"/>
petticoat, and could not get it up from
the bottom—But what did that signify?
they mought laff, but they could see no∣thing;
for I was up to the sin in water.
To be sure, it threw me into such a gum∣bustion,
that I know not what I said, nor
what I did, nor how they got me out,
and rapt me in a blanket—Mrs. Tabitha
scoulded a little when we got home; but
she knows as I know what's what—Ah
Laud help you!—There is Sir Yury Mic∣ligut,
of Balnaclinch, in the cunty of
Kalloway—I took down the name from
his gentleman, Mr. O Frizzle, and he
has got an estate of fifteen hundred a year
—I am sure he is both rich and generous
—But you nose, Molly, I was always
famous for keeping secrets; and so he
was very safe in trusting me with his flegm
for mistress; which, to be sure, is very
honourable; for Mr. O Frizzle assures
me, he values not her portion a brass
varthing—And, indeed, what's poor ten
thousand pounds to a Baron Knight of his
fortune? and, truly, I told Mr. O Friz∣zle,
that was all she had to trust to—As
for John Thomas, he's a morass fellor—
I vow, I thought he would a fit with Mr.
O Frizzle, because he axed me to dance
with him at Spring Garden—But God
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
he knows I have no thoughts eyther of
wan or t'other.</P>
<P>As for house news, the worst is, Chow∣der
has fallen off greatly from his sto∣mick
—He eats nothing but white meats,
and not much of that; and wheezes, and
seems to be much bloated. The doctors
think he is threatened with a dropsy—
Parson Marrofat, who has got the same
disorder, finds great benefit from the wa∣ters;
but Chowder seems to like them no
better than the squire; and mistress says,
if his case don't take a favourable turn,
she will sartinly carry him to Aberga'nny,
to drink goat's-whey—To be sure, the
poor dear honymil is lost for want of ax∣ercise;
for which reason, she intends to
give him an airing once a-day upon the
Downs, in a post-chaise—I have already
made very creditable correxions in this
here place; where, to be sure, we have
the very squintasense of satiety—Mrs.
Patcher, my lady Kilmacullock's woman,
and I are sworn sisters. She has shewn
me all her secrets, and learned me to wash
gaze, and refrash rusty siks and bumbe∣seens,
by boiling them with winegar,
chamberlye, and stale beer. My short
sack and apron luck as good as new from
the shop, and my pumpy door as fresh as
<PB N="87" REF="100"/>
a rose, by the help of turtle-water—But
this is all Greek and Latten to you, Mol∣ly—
If we should come to Abrga'ny,
you'll be within a day's ride of us; and
then we shall see wan another, please
God—If not, remember me in your

<P>I AM astonished, that Dr. Lewis
should take upon him to give away Al∣derney,
without my privity and concur∣rants
—What signifies my brother's order?
My brother is little better than Noncom∣push.
He would give away the shirt off
his back, and the teeth out of his head;
nay, as for that matter, he would have
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
ruinated the family with his ridiculous cha∣rities,
if it had not been for my four
quarters—What between his willfullness
and his waste, his trumps, and his frenzy,
I lead the life of an indented slave. Al∣derney
gave four gallons a-day, ever
since the calf was sent to market. There
is so much milk out of my dairy, and the
press must stand still: but I won't loose a
cheese paring; and the milk shall be
made good, if the sarvents should go
without butter. If they must needs have
butter, let them make it of sheeps' milk;
but then my wool will suffer for want of
grace; so that I must be a looser on all
sides—Well, patience is like a stout
Welsh poney; it bears a great deal, and
trots a great way; but it will tire at the
long run. Before its long, perhaps I
may shew Matt, that I was not born to
be the household drudge to my dying
day—Gwyn rites from Crickhowel, that
the price of flannel is fallen three-far∣things
an ell; and that's another good
penny out of my pocket—When I go to
market to sell, my commodity stinks;
but when I want to buy the commonest
thing, the owner pricks it up under my
nose; and it can't be had for love nor
money—I think every thing runs cross at
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
Brambleton-hall—You say the gander has
broke the eggs; which is a phinumenon
I don't understand; for when the fox car∣ried
off the old goose last year, he took
her place, and hatched the eggs, and
partected the goslings like a tender pa∣rent—Then
you tell me the thunder has
soured two barrels of beer in the seller.
But how the thunder should get there,
when the seller was double-locked, I
can't comprehend. Howsomever, I won't
have the beer thrown out, till I see it
with my own eyes. Perhaps, it will
recover—At least it will serve for vinegar
to the sarvents. You may leave off the
fires in my brother's chamber and mine,
as it is unsartain when we return.—I
hope, Gwyllim, you'll take care there is no
waste; and have an eye to the maids, and
keep them to their spinning. I think
they may go very well without beer in
hot weather—It serves only to inflame the
blood, and set them a-gog after the men.
Water will make them fair, and keep
them cool and tamperit. Don't forget
to put up in the portmantel, that cums

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE done with the waters; there∣fore
your advice comes a day too late—
I grant that physick is no mystery of your
making. I know it is a mystery in its
own nature; and, like other mysteries,
requires a strong gulp of faith to make
it go down—Two days ago, I went into
the King's Bath, by the advice of our
friend Ch—, in order to clear the
strainer of the skin, for the benefit of a
free perspiration; and the first object that
saluted my eye, was a child full of scro∣phulous
ulcers, carried in the arms of
one of the guides, under the very noses
of the bathers. I was so shocked at the
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
sight, that I retired immediately with in∣dignation
and disgust—Suppose the mat∣ter
of those ulcers, floating on the water,
comes in contact with my skin, when the
pores are all open, I would ask you what
must be the consequence?—Good
Heaven, the very thought makes my
blood run cold! we know not what sores
may be running into the water while we
are bathing, and what sort of matter we
may thus imbibe; the king's-evil, the
scurvy, the cancer, and the pox; and,
no doubt, the heat will render the <HI>virus</HI>
the more volatile and penetrating. To
purify myself from all such contamina∣tion,
I went to the duke of Kingston's
private Bath, and there I was almost suf∣focated
for want of free air; the place
was so small, and the steam so stifling.</P>
<P>After all, if the intention is no more
than to wash the skin, I am convinced
that simple element is more effectual than
any water impregnated with salt and
iron; which, being astringent, will cer∣tainly
contract the pores, and leave a
kind of crust upon the surface of the
body. But I am now as much afraid of
drinking, as of bathing; for, after a
long conversation with the Doctor, about
the construction of the pump and the
<PB N="92" REF="105"/>
cistern, it is very far from being clear
with me, that the patients in the Pump-room
don't swallow the scourings of the
bathers. I can't help suspecting, that
there is, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r may be, some regurgitation
from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath into the cistern of the
pump. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that case, what a delicate be∣veridge
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every day quaffed by the
drinkers; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edicated with the sweat, and
dirt, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andriff; and the abominable
discharges of various kinds, from twenty
different <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>seased bodies, parboiling in
the kettle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elow. In order to avoid this
filthy composition, I had recourse to the
spring that supplies the private baths on
the Abbey-green; but I at once perceiv∣ed
something extraordinary in the taste
and smell; and, upon inquiry, I find
that the Roman baths in this quarter,
were found covered by an old burying
ground, belonging to the Abbey; thro'
which, in all probability, the water
drains in its passage: so that as we drink
the decoction of living bodies at the
Pump-room, we swallow the strainings
of rotten bones and carcasses at the pri∣vate
bath—I vow to God, the very idea
turns my stomach!—Determined, as I
am, against any farther use of the Bath
waters, this consideration would give me
<PB N="93" REF="106"/>
little disturbance, if I could find any
thing more pure, or less pernicious, to
quench my thirst; but, although the
natural springs of excellent water are seen
gushing spontaneous on every side, from
the hills that surround us, the inhabi∣tants,
in general, make use of well-water,
so impregnated with nitre, or alum, or
some other villainous mineral, that it is
equally ungrateful to the taste, and mis∣chievous
to the constitution. It must be
owned, indeed, that here, in Milsham∣street,
we have a precarious and scanty
supply from the hill; which is collected
in an open bason in the Circus, liable to
be defiled with dead dogs, cats, rats,
and every species of nastiness, which the
rascally populace my throw into it, from
mere wantonness and brutality.—</P>
<P>Well, there is no nation that drinks so
hoggishly as the English—What passes
for wine among us, is not the juice of
the grape. It is an adulterous mixture,
brewed up of nauseous ingredients, by
dunces, who are bunglers in the art of
poison-making; and yet we, and our
forefathers, are and have been poisoned
by this cur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed drench, without taste or
flavour—The only genuine and wholsome
beveridge in England, is London porter,
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
and Dorchester table-beer; but as for
your ale and your gin, your cyder, and
your perry, and all the trashy family of
made wines, I detest them as infernal
compositions, contrived for the destruc∣tion
of the human species.—But what
have I to do with the human species? ex∣cept
a very few friends, I care not if the
whole was—.</P>
<P>Heark ye, Lewis, my misanthrophy in∣creases
every day—The longer I live, I
find the folly and the fraud of mankind
grow more and more intolerable—I wish
I had not come from Brambleton-hall;
after having lived in solitude so long, I
cannot bear the hurry and impertinence of
the multitude; besides, every thing is
sophisticated in these crowded places.
Snares are laid for our lives in every thing
we eat or drink: the very air we breathe,
is loaded with contagion. We cannot
even sleep, without risque of infection.
I say, infection—This place is the ren∣dezvous
of the diseased—You won't de∣ny,
that many diseases are infectious;
even the consumption itself, is highly in∣fectious.
When a person dies of it in
Italy, the bed and bedding are destroyed;
the other furniture is exposed to the wea∣ther,
and the apartment white-washed,
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
before it is occupied by any other living
soul. You'll allow, that nothing receives
infection sooner, or retains it longer, than
blankets, feather-beds, and matrasses—
'Sdeath! how do I know what miserable
objects have been stewing in the bed
where I now lie!—I wonder, Dick, you
did not put me in mind of sending for my
own matrasses—But, if I had not been
an ass, I should not have needed a re∣membrancer—There
is always some
plaguy reflection that rises up in judg∣ment
against me, and ruffles my spirits—
Therefore, let us change the subject—</P>
<P>I have other reasons for abridging my
stay at Bath—You know sister Tabby's
complexion—If Mrs. Tabitha Bramble
had been of any other race, I should cer∣tainly
have looked upon her as the most—
But, the truth is, she has found means to
interest my affection; or, rather, she is
beholden to the force of prejudice, com∣monly
called the ties of blood. Well,
this amiable maiden has actually com∣menced
a flirting correspondence with an
Irish baronet of sixty-five. His name is
Sir Ulic Mackilligut. He is said to be
much out at elbows; and, I believe,
has received false intelligence with re∣spect
to her fortune. Be that as it may,
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
the connexion is exceedingly ridiculous,
and begins already to excite whispers.
For my part, I have no intention to dis∣pute
her free-agency; though I shall fall
upon some expedient to undeceive her
paramour, as to the point which he has
principally in view. But I don't think
her conduct is a proper example for Lid∣dy,
who has also attracted the notice of
some coxcombs in the Rooms; and Jer∣ry
tells me, he suspects a strapping fellow,
the knight's nephew, of some design up∣on
the girl's heart. I shall, therefore,
keep a strict eye over her aunt and her,
and even shift the scene, if I find the
matter grow more serious—You perceive
what an agreeable task it must be, to a

such souls as these—But, hold, you shall

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus
college, Oxon.
DEAR KNIGHT,</OPENER>
<P>I THINK those people are unreasonable,
who complain that Bath is a contracted
circle, in which the same dull scenes per∣petually
revolve, without variation—I
am, on the contrary, amazed to find so
small a place, so crowded with entertain∣ment
and variety. London itself can
hardly exhibit one species of diversion, to
which we have not something analogous
at Bath, over and above those singular ad∣vantages
that are peculiar to the place.
Here, for example, a man has daily op∣portunities
of seeing the most remarkable
characters of the community. He sees
them in their natural attitudes and true
colours; descended from their pedestals,
and divested of their formal draperies,
undisguised by art and affectation—Here
we have ministers of state, judges, gene∣rals,
bishops, projectors, philosophers,
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
wits, poets, players, <HI>chemists, fiadlers,</HI> and
<HI>buffoons.</HI> If he makes any considerable
stay in the place, he is sure of meeting
with some particular friend, whom he did
not expect to see; and to me there is no∣thing
more agreeable, than such casual
rencounters—Another entertainment, pe∣culiar
to Bath, arises from the general
mixture of all degrees assembled in our
public rooms, without distinction of rank
or fortune. This is what my uncle re∣probates,
as a monstrous jumble of he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rogeneous
principles; a vile mob of noise
and impertinence, without decency or
subordination. But this chaos is to me
a source of infinite amusement.</P>
<P>I was extremely diverted, last ball-night,
to see the Master of the Ceremonies lead∣ing,
with great solemnity, to the upper
end of the room, an antiquated Abigail,
dressed in her lady's cast-clothes; whom
he (I suppose) mistook for some countess
just arrived at the Bath. The ball was o∣pened
by a Scotch lord, with a mulatto
heiress from St. Christopher's; and the
gay colonel Tinsel danced all the even∣ing
with the daughter of an eminent tin∣man
from the borough of Southwark—
Yesterday morning, at the Pump-room,
I saw a broken-winded Wapping land∣lady
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
squeeze through a circle of peers,
to salute her brandy-merchant, who stood
by the window, prop'd upon crutches;
and a paralytic attorney of Shoe-lane, in
shuffling up to the bar, kicked the shins
of the chancellor of England, while his
lordship, in a cut bob, drank a glass of
water at the pump. I cannot account
for my being pleased with these incidents,
any other way than by saying, they are
truly ridiculous in their own nature, and
serve to heighten the humour in the farce
of life, which I am determined to enjoy
as long as I can.—</P>
<P>Those follies, that move my uncle's
spleen, excite my laughter. He is as
tender as a man without a skin; who
cannot bear the slightest touch without
flinching. What tickles another would
give him torment; and yet he has what
we may call lucid intervals, when he is
remarkably facetious—Indeed, I never
knew a hypochondriac so apt to be in∣fected
with good-humour. He is the
most risible misanthrope I ever met with.
A lucky joke, or any ludicrous incident,
will set him a-laughing immoderately,
even in one of his most gloomy pa∣roxysms;
and, when the laugh is over,
he will curse his own imbecillity. In
<PB N="100" REF="113"/>
conversing with strangers, he betrays no
marks of disquiet—He is splenetic with
his familiars only; and not even with
them, while they keep his attention em∣ployed;
but when his spirits are not ex∣erted
externally, they seem to recoil and
prey upon himself—He has renounced
the waters with execration; but he be∣gins
to find a more efficacious, and, cer∣tainly,
a much more palatable remedy in
the pleasures of society. He has disco∣vered
some old friends, among the inva∣lids
of Bath; and, in particular, renewed
his acquaintance with the celebrated
James Quin, who certainly did not
come here to drink water. You cannot
doubt, but that I had the strongest curio∣sity
to know this original; and it was
gratified by Mr. Bramble, who has had
him twice at our house to dinner.</P>
<P>So far as I am able to judge, Quin's
character is rather more respectable than
it has been generally represented. His
<HI>bons mots</HI> are in every witling's mouth;
but many of them have a rank flavour,
which one would be apt to think was
derived from a natural grossness of idea.
I suspect, however, that justice has not
been done the author, by the collectors
of those <HI>Quiniana;</HI> who have let the best
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
of them slip through their fingers, and
only retained such as were suited to
the taste and organs of the multitude.
How far he may relax in his hours of jol∣lity,
I cannot pretend to say; but his ge∣neral
conversation is conducted by the
nicest rules of propriety; and Mr. James
Quin is, certainly, one of the best bred
men in the kingdom. He is not only a
most agreeable companion; but (as I am
credibly informed) a very honest man;
highly susceptible of friendship, warm,
steady, and even generous in his attach∣ments;
disdaining flattery, and incapable
of meanness and dissimulation. Were I to
judge, however, from Quin's eye alone,
I should take him to be proud, insolent,
and cruel. There is something remark∣ably
severe and forbidding in his aspect;
and, I have been told, he was ever dis∣posed
to insult his inferiors and depen∣dants.—Perhaps
that report has influ∣enced
my opinion of his looks—You
know we are the fools of prejudice. How∣soever
that may be, I have as yet seen
nothing but his favourable side; and my
uncle, who frequently confers with him
in a corner, declares he is one of the most
sensible men he ever knew—He seems to
have a reciprocal regard for old Square∣toes,
<PB N="102" REF="115"/>
whom he calls by the familiar name
of Matthew, and often reminds of their
old tavern-adventures: on the other hand,
Matthew's eyes sparkle whenever Quin
makes his appearance—Let him be never
so jarring and discordant, Quin puts him
in tune; and, like treble and bass in the
same concert, they make excellent musick
together—T'other day, the conversation
turning upon Shakespeare, I could not
help saying, with some emotion, that I
would give an hundred guineas to see
Mr. Quin act the part of Falstaff; upon
which, turning to me with a smile,
“And I would give a thousand, young
gentleman, (said he) that I could gra∣tify
your longing.” My uncle and he
are perfectly agreed in their estimate of
life; which, Quin says, would stink in
his nostrils, if he did not steep it in
claret.</P>
<P>I want to see this phenomenon in his
cups; and have almost prevailed upon un∣cle
to give him a small turtle at the Bear.
In the mean time, I must entertain you
with an incident, that seems to confirm
the judgment of those two cynic philoso∣phers.
I took the liberty to differ in
opinion from Mr. Bramble, when he ob∣served,
that the mixture of people in the
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
entertainments of this place was destruc∣tive
of all order and urbanity; that it
rendered the plebeians insufferably arro∣gant
and troublesome, and vulgarized the
deportment and sentiments of those who
moved in the upper spheres of life. He
said, such a preposterous coalition would
bring us into contempt with all our neigh∣bours;
and was worse, in fact, than de∣basing
the gold coin of the nation. I ar∣gued,
on the contrary, that those ple∣beians
who discovered such eagerness to
imitate the dress and equipage of their su∣periors,
would likewise, in time, adopt
their maxims and their manners, be po∣lished
by their conversation, and refined
by their example; but when I appealed
to Mr. Quin, and asked if he did not
think that such an unreserved mixture
would improve the whole mass?—“Yes,
(said he) as a plate of marmalade would
improve a pan of sirreverence.”</P>
<P>I owned I was not much conversant in
high-life, but I had seen what were called
polite assemblies in London and else∣where;
that those of Bath seemed to be
as decent as any; and that, upon the
whole, the individuals that composed it,
would not be found deficient in good
manners and decorum. “But let us

have recourse to experience, (said I)—
Jack Holder, who was intended for a

his elder brother. He is now at the
Bath, driving about in a phaeton and
four, with French horns. He has
treated with turtle and claret at all the
taverns in Bath and Bristol, till his
guests are gorged with good chear:
he has bought a dozen suits of fine
clothes, by the advice of the Master
of the Ceremonies, under whose tui∣tion
he has entered himself: he has lost
some hundreds at billiards to sharpers,
and taken one of the nymphs of Avon∣street
into keeping; but, finding all
these channels insufficient to drain him
of his current cash, his counsellor has
engaged him to give a general tea-drinking
to-morrow at Wiltshire's
room. In order to give it the more
eclat, every table is to be furnished
with sweet-meats and nosegays; which,
however, are not to be touched till
notice is given by the ringing of a
bell, and then the ladies may help
themselves without restriction. This
will be no bad way of trying the com∣pany's
breeding—”</P>

“I will abide by that experiment,
(cried my uncle) and if I could find
a place to stand secure, without the
vortex of the tumult, which I know
will ensue, I would certainly go thither
and enjoy the scene.” Quin proposed
that we should take our station in the
musick-gallery; and we took his advice.
Holder had got thither before us, with
his horns perdue; but we were admitted.
The tea-drinking passed as usual; and
the company having risen from the ta∣bles,
were sauntring in groupes, in ex∣pectation
of the signal for attack, when
the bell beginning to ring, they flew with
eagerness to the desert, and the who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
place was instantly in commotion. There
was nothing but justling, scrambling,
pulling, snatching, struggling, scolding,
and screaming. The nosegays were torn
from one another's hands and bosoms;
the glasses and china went to wreck; the
tables and floor were strewed with comfits.
Some cried; some swore; and the tropes
and figures of Billingsgate were used
without reserve in all their native zest and
flavour; nor were those flowers of rhe∣toric
unattended with significant resticu∣lation.
Some snapped their fingers;
some forked them out; some clapped
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
their hands, and some their back-sides;
at length, they fairly proceeded to pull∣ing
caps, and every thing seemed to pre∣sage
a general battle; when Holder or∣dered
his horns to sound a charge, with a
view to animate the combatants, and in∣flame
the contest; but this manoeuvre
produced an effect quite contrary to what
he expected. It was a note of reproach
that roused them to an immediate sense
of their disgraceful situation. They were
ashamed of their absurd deportment, and
suddenly desisted. They gathered up
their caps, ruffles, and handkerchiefs;
and great part of them retired in silent
mortification.</P>
<P>Quin laughed at this adventure; but
my uncle's delicacy was hurt. He hung
his head in manifest chagrin, and seemed
to repine at the triumph of his judgment
—Indeed, his victory was more complete
than he imagined; for, as we afterwards
learned, the two amazons who singulariz∣ed
themselves most in the action, did not
come from the purlieus of Puddle-dock,
but from the courtly neighbourhood of
St. James's palace. One was a baroness,
and the other, a wealthy knight's dowa∣ger—My
uncle spoke not a word, till we
had made our retreat good to the coffee∣house;
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
where, taking off his hat and
wiping his forehead, “I bless God (said
he) that Mrs. Tabitha Bramble did not
take the field to-day!” “I would pit
her for a cool hundred (cried Quin)
against the best shake-bag of the whole
main.” The truth is, nothing could
have kept her at home but the accident
of her having taken physick before she
knew the nature of the entertainment.
She has been for some days furbishing up
an old suit of black velvet, to make her
appearance as Sir Ulic's partner at the
next ball.</P>
<P>I have much to say of this amiable
kinswoman; but she has not been proper∣ly
introduced to your acquaintance. She
is remarkably civil to Mr. Quin; of
whose sarcastic humour she seems to stand
in awe; but her caution is no match for
her impertinence. “Mr. Gwynn, (said
she the other day) I was once vastly en∣tertained
with your playing the Ghost
of Gimlet at Drury-lane, when you
rose up through the stage, with a white
face and red eyes, and spoke of <HI>quails
upon the frightful porcofine—</HI> Do, pray,
spout a little the Ghost of Gimlet.”
“Madam, (said Quin, with a glance of
ineffable disdain) the Ghost of Gimlet is
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
laid, never to rise again—” Insensible
of this check, she proceeded: “Well,
to be sure, you looked and talked so
like a real ghost; and then the cock
crowed so natural. I wonder how you
could teach him to crow so exact, in
the very nick of time; but, I suppose,
he's game—An't he game, Mr.
Gwynn?” “Dunghill, madam.”
“Well, dung-hill, or not dunghill, he
has got such a clear counter-tenor, that
I wish I had such another at Bramble∣ton-hall,
to wake the maids of a morn∣ing.
Do you know where I could
find one of his brood?” “Probably
in the work-house of St. Giles's parish,
madam; but I protest I know not his
particular mew.” My uncle, frying
with vexation, cried, “Good God, sister,
how you talk! I have told you twenty
times, that this gentleman's name is
not Gwynn.—” “Hoity toity, bro∣ther
mine, (she replied) no offence, I
hope—Gwynn is an honourable name,
of true old British extraction—I
thought the gentleman had been come
of Mrs. Helen Gwynn, who was of his
own prosession; and if so be that were
the case, he might be of king Charles's
breed, and have royal blood in his
<PB N="109" REF="122"/>
veins—” “No, madam, (answered
Quin, with great solemnity) my mo∣ther
was not a whore of such distinc∣tion—True
it is, I am sometimes
tempted to believe myself of royal
descent; for my inclinations are often
arbitrary—If I was an absolute prince,
at this instant, I believe I should send
for the head of your cook in a charger
—She has committed felony, on the
person of that John Dory; which is
mangled in a cruel manner, and even
presented without sauce—<HI>O tempora!
O mores!</HI>”</P>
<P>This good-humoured sally turned the
conversation into a less disagreeable chan∣nel—But,

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR LEWIS,</OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your bill upon Wilt∣shire,
which was punctually honoured;
but as I don't choose to keep so much
cash by me, in a common lodging-house,
I have deposited 250 <HI>l.</HI> in the bank of
Bath, and shall take their bills for it in
London, when I leave this place, where
the season draws to an end—You must
know, that now being a-foot, I am re∣solved
to give Liddy a glimpse of Lon∣don.
She is one of the best hearted crea∣tures
I ever knew, and gains upon my
affection every day—As for Tabby, I
have dropt such hints to the Irish baronet,
concerning her fortune, as, I make no
doubt, will cool the ardour of his ad∣dresses.
Then her pride will take the
alarm; and the rancour of stale maiden∣hood
being chafed, we shall hear nothing
but slander and abuse of Sir Ulic Mac∣killigut—This
rupture, I foresee, will
facilitate our departure from Bath; where,
<PB N="111" REF="124"/>
at present, Tabby seems to enjoy herself
with peculiar satisfaction. For my part,
I detest it so much, that I should not
have been able to stay so long in the place
if I had not discovered some old friends;
whose conversation alleviates my disgust—
Going to the coffee-house one forenoon,
I could not help contemplating the com∣pany,
with equal surprize and compassi∣on—We
consisted of thirteen individuals;
seven lamed by the gout, rheumatism,
or palsy; three maimed by accident; and
the rest either deaf or blind. One hob∣bled,
another hopped, a third dragged
his legs after him like a wounded snake,
a fourth straddled betwixt a pair of long
crutches, like the mummy of a felon
hanging in chains; a fifth was bent into
a horizontal position, like a mounted te∣lescope,
shoved in by a couple of chair∣men;
and a sixth was the bust of a man,
set upright in a wheel machine, which
the waiter moved from place to place.</P>
<P>Being struck with some of their faces,
I consulted the subscription-book; and,
perceiving the names of several old
friends, began to consider the groupe
with more attention. At length I dis∣covered
rear-admiral Balderick, the
companion of my youth, whom I had
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
not seen since he was appointed lieute∣nant
of the Severn. He was metamor∣phosed
into an old man, with a wooden
leg and a weatherbeaten face; which ap∣peared
the more antient from his grey
locks, that were truly venerable—Sitting
down at the table, where he was reading
a news-paper, I gazed at him for some
minutes, with a mixture of pleasure and
regret, which made my heart gush with
tenderness; then, taking him by the
hand, “Ah, Sam, (said I) forty years
ago I little thought—” I was too much
moved to proceed. “An old friend,
sure enough! (cried he, squeezing my
hand, and surveying me eagerly thro'
his glasses) I know the looming of the
vessel, though she has been hard strain∣ed
since we parted; but I can't heave
up the name—” The moment I told
him who I was, he exclaimed. “Ha!
Matt, my old fellow cruizer, still a∣float!”
And, starting up, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me
in his arms. His transport, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wever,
boded me no good; for, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> salu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng me,
he thrust the spring of his spectacles into
my eye, and, at the same time, set his
wooden stump upon my gouty toe; an
attack that made me shed tears in sad
earnest—After the hurry of our recog∣nition
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
was over, he pointed out two of
our common friends in the room: the
bust was what remained of colonel Cock∣ril,
who had lost the use of his limbs in
making an American campaign; and the
telescope proved to be my college chum,
sir Reginald Bently; who, with his new
title, and unexpected inheritance, com∣menced
fox-hunter, without having serv∣ed
his apprenticeship to the mystery;
and, in consequence of following the
hounds through a river, was seized with
an inflammation in his bowels, which
has contracted him into his present atti∣tude.</P>
<P>Our former correspondence was forth∣with
renewed, with the most hearty ex∣pressions
of mutual good-will; and as we
had met so unexpectedly, we agreed to
dine together that very day at the tavern.
My friend Quin, being luckily unen∣gaged,
obliged us with his company;
and, truly, this was the most happy day
I have passed these twenty years. You
and I, Lewis, having been always toge∣ther,
never tasted friendship in this high
goût, contracted from long absence. I
cannot express the half of what I felt at
this casual meeting of three or four com∣panions,
who had been so long separated,
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
and so roughly treated by the storms of
life. It was a renovation of youth; a
kind of resuscitation of the dead, that re∣alized
those interesting dreams, in which
we sometimes retrieve our antient friends
from the grave. Perhaps my enjoyment
was not the less pleasing for being mix∣ed
with a strain of melancholy, produced
by the remembrance of past scenes, that
conjured up the ideas of some endearing
connexions, which the hand of Death has
actually dissolved.</P>
<P>The spirits and good-humour of the
company seemed to triumph over the
wreck of their costitutions. They had
even philosophy enough to joke upon
their own calamities; such is the power
of friendship, the sovereign cordial of life
—I afterwards found, however, that they
were not without their moments, and
even hours of disquiet. Each of them a∣part,
in succeeding conferences, expati∣ated
upon his own particular grievances;
and they were all malcontents at bottom
—Over and above their personal disasters,
they thought themselves unfortunate in
the lottery of life. Baldrick complained,
that all the recompence he had received
for his long and hard service, was the
half-pay of a rear-admiral. The colo∣nel
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
was mortified to see himself over-top∣ped
by upstart generals, some of whom
he had once commanded; and, being a
man of a liberal turn, could ill put up
with a moderate annuity, for which he
had sold his commission. As for the ba∣ronet,
having run himself considerably in
debt, on a contested election, he has been
obliged to relinquish his seat in parlia∣ment,
and his seat in the country at the
same time, and put his estate to nurse;
but his chagrin, which is the effect of his
own misconduct, does not affect me half
so much as that of the other two; who
have acted honourable and distinguished
parts on the great theatre, and are now
reduced to lead a weary life in this stew∣pan
of idleness and insignificance. They
have long left off using the waters, after
having experienced their inefficacy. The
diversions of the place they are not in a
condition to enjoy. How then do they
make shift to pass their time? In the
forenoon, they crawl out to the Rooms
or the coffee-house, where they take a
hand at whist, or descant upon the Gene∣ral
Advertiser; and their evenings they
murder in private parties, among peevish
invalids, and insipid old women—This
is the case with a good number of indi∣viduals,
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
whom nature seems to have in∣tended
for better purposes.</P>
<P>About a dozen years ago, many decent
families, restricted to small fortunes, be∣sides
those that came hither on the score
of health, were tempted to settle at Bath,
where they could then live comfortably,
and even make a genteel appearance, at a
small expence: but the madness of the
times has made the place too hot for
them, and they are now obliged to think
of other migrations—Some have already
fled to the mountains of Wales, and
others have retired to Exeter. Thither,
no doubt, they will be followed by the
flood of luxury and extravagance, which
will drive them from place to place to the
very Land's End; and there, I suppose,
they will be obliged to ship themselves
to some other country. Bath is become
a mere sink of profligacy and extortion.
Every article of house-keeping is raised to
an enormous price; a circumstance no
longer to be wondered at, when we know
that every petty retainer of fortune
piques himself upon keeping a table, and
thinks 'tis for the honour of his character
to wink at the knavery of his servants,
who are in a confederacy with the market-people;
and, of consequence, pay what∣ever
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
they demand. Here is now a mush∣room
of opulence, who pays a cook
seventy guineas a week for furnishing him
with one meal a day. This portentous
frenzy is become so contagious, that the
very rabble and refuse of mankind are
infected. I have known a negro-driver,
from Jamacia, pay over-night to the ma∣ster
of one of the rooms, sixty-five
guineas for tea and coffee to the com∣pany,
and leave Bath next morning, in
such obscurity, that not one of his guests
had the slightest idea of his person, or
even made the least inquiry about his
name. Incidents of this kind are fre∣quent;
and every day teems with fresh
absurdities, which are too gross to make
a thinking man merry.—But I feel the
spleen creeping on me apace; and there∣fore
will indulge you with a cessation,
that you may have no unnecessary cause

<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you at great length by the
post, the twenty-sixth of last month, to
which I refer you for an account of our
proceedings at Bath; and I expect your
answer with impatience. But, having
this opportunity of a private hand, I send
you two dozen of Bath rings; six of the
best of which I desire you will keep for
yourself, and distribute the rest among
the young ladies, our common friends, as
you shall think proper—I don't know
how you will approve of the mottoes;
some of them are not much to my own
liking; but I was obliged to take such
as I could find ready manufactured—I
am vexed, that neither you nor I have re∣ceived
any further information of a cer∣tain
person—Sure it can't be wilful neg∣lect!—O
my dear Willis! I begin to be
visited by strange fancies, and to have
some melancholy doubts; which, how∣ever,
<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
it would be ungenerous to harbour
without further inquiry—My uncle, who
has made me a present of a very fine set
of garnets, talks of treating us with a
jaunt to London; which, you may ima∣gine,
will be highly agreeable: but I
like Bath so well, that I hope he won't
think of leaving it till the season is quite
over; and yet, betwixt friends, some∣thing
has happened to my aunt, which
will probably shorten our stay in this
place.</P>
<P>Yesterday, in the forenoon, she went
by herself to a breakfasting in one of the
rooms; and, in half an hour, returned in
great agitation, having Chowder along
with her in the chair. I believe some ac∣cident
must have happened to that un∣lucky
animal, which is the great source
of all her troubles. Dear Letty! what a
pity it is, that a woman of her years and
discretion, should place her affection up∣on
such an ugly, ill-conditioned cur, that
snarls and snaps at every body. I asked
John Thomas, the foot-man who attend∣ed
her, what was the matter? and he did
nothing but grin. A famous dog-doctor
was sent for, and undertook to cure the
patient, provided he might carry him
home to his own house; but his mistress
<PB N="120" REF="133"/>
would not part with him out of her own
sight—She ordered the cook to warm
cloths, which she applied to his bowels,
with her own hand. She gave up all
thoughts of going to the ball in the even∣ing;
and when Sir Ulic came to drink
tea, refused to be seen; so that he went
away to look for another partner. My
brother Jery whistles and dances. My
uncle sometimes shrugs up his shoulders,
and sometimes bursts out a-laughing. My
aunt sobs and scolds by turns; and her
woman, Win Jinkins, stares and wonders
with a foolish face of curiosity; and, for
my part, I am as curious as she, but
ashamed to ask questions.</P>
<P>Perhaps time will discover the myste∣ry;
for if it was any thing that happened
in the Rooms, it can't be long concealed
—All I know is, that last night at supper,
miss Bramble spoke very disdainfully of
Sir Ulic Mackilligut, and asked her bro∣ther
if he intended to keep us sweltering
all the summer at Bath? “No, sister
Tabitha, (said he, with an arch smile)
we shall retreat before the Dog-days
begin; though I make no doubt, that
with a little temperance and discretion,
our constitutions might be kept cool
enough all the year, even at Bath.”
<PB N="121" REF="134"/>
As I don't know the meaning of this in∣sinuation,
I won't pretend to make any
remarks upon it at present: hereafter,
perhaps, I may be able to explain it more
to your satisfaction—In the mean time,
I beg you will be punctual in your corre∣spondence,

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.</OPENER>
<P>SO then Mrs. Blackerby's affair has
proved a false alarm, and I have saved
my money? I wish, however, her decla∣ration
had not been so premature; for
though my being thought capable of
making her a mother, might have given
me some credit, the reputation of an in∣trigue
with such a cracked pitcher does
me no honour at all—In my last I told
you I had hopes of seeing Quin, in his
hours of elevation at the tavern which
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
is the temple of mirth and good-fellow∣ship;
where he, as priest of Comus, ut∣ters
the inspirations of wit and humour
—I have had that satisfaction. I have
dined with his club at the Three Tuns,
and had the honour to sit him out. At
half an hour past eight in the evening, he
was carried home with six good bottles of
claret under his belt; and it being then
Friday, he gave orders, that he should
not be disturbed till Sunday at noon—
You must not imagine that this dose had
any other effect upon his conversation,
but that of making it more extravagant∣ly
entertaining—He had lost the use of
his limbs, indeed, several hours before
we parted, but he retained all his other
faculties in perfection; and as he gave
vent to every whimsical idea as it rose,
I was really astonished at the brilliancy of
his thoughts, and the force of his expres∣sion.
Quin is a real voluptuary in the
articles of eating and drinking; and so
confirmed an epicure, in the common
acceptation of the term, that he cannot
put up with ordinary fare. This is a
point of such importance with him, that
he always takes upon himself the charge
of catering; and a man admitted to his
mess, is always sure of eating delicate
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
victuals, and drinking excellent wine—
He owns himself addicted to the delights
of the stomach, and often jokes upon
his own sensuality; but there is nothing
selfish in this appetite—He finds that
good chear unites good company; exhi∣lerates
the spirits, opens the heart, ba∣nishes
all restraint from conversation, and
promotes the happiest purposes of social
life.—But Mr. James Quin is not a sub∣ject
to be discussed in the compass of one
letter; I shall therefore, at present, leave
him to his repose, and call another of a
very different complexion.</P>
<P>You desire to have further acquain∣tance
with the person of our aunt, and
promise yourself much entertainment
from her connexion with Sir Ulic Mackil∣ligut:
but in this hope you are baulked
already; that connexion is dissolved.
The Irish baronet is an old hound, that,
finding her carrion, has quitted the scent—
I have already told you, that Mrs. Tabi∣tha
Bramble is a maiden of sorty-five. In
her person, she is tall, raw-boned, auk∣wark,
flat-chested, and stooping; her
complexion is sallow and freckled; her
eyes are not grey, but greenish, like those
of a cat, and generally inflamed; her
hair is of a sandy, or rather dusty hue;
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
her forehead low; her nose long, sharp,
and, towards the extremity, always red
in cool weather; her lips skinny, her
mouth extensive, her teeth straggling and
loose, of various colours and conforma∣tion;
and her long neck shrivelled into
a thousand wrinkles—In her temper, she
is proud, stiff, vain, imperious, prying,
malicious, greedy, and uncharitable. In
all likelihood, her natural austerity has
been soured by disappointment in love;
for her long celibacy is by no means ow∣ing
to her dislike of matrimony: on the
contrary, she has left no stone unturned
to avoid the reproachful epithet of old
maid.</P>
<P>Before I was born, she had gone such
lengths in the way of flirting with a re∣cruiting
officer, that her reputation was
a little singed. She afterwards made ad∣vances
to the curate of the parish, who
dropped some distant hints about the next
presentation to the living, which was in
her brother's gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; but finding that was
already promised to another, he flew off
at a tangent; and Mrs. Tabby, in re∣venge,
found means to deprive him of
his cure. Her next lover was lieutenant
of a man of war, a relation of the fami∣ly,
who did not understand the refine∣ments
<PB N="125" REF="138"/>
of the passion, and expressed no
aversion to grapple with cousin Tabby in
the way of marriage; but before matters
could be properly adjusted, he went out
on a cruise, and was killed in an engage∣ment
with a French frigate. Our aunt,
though baffled so often, did not yet des∣pair—She
layed all her snares for Dr.
Lewis, who is the <HI>fidus Achates</HI> of my un∣cle.
She even fell sick upon the occa∣sion,
and prevailed with Matt to inter∣pose
in her behalf with his friend; but
the Doctor, being a shy cock, would not
be caught with chaff, and flatly rejected
the proposal: so that Mrs. Tabitha was
content to exert her patience once more,
after having endeavoured in vain to effect
a rupture betwixt the two friends; and
now she thinks proper to be very civil to
Lewis, who is become necessary to her in
the way of his profession.</P>
<P>These, however, are not the only ef∣forts
she has made towards a nearer con∣junction
with our sex. Her fortune was
originally no more than a thousand
pounds; but she gained an accession
of five hundred by the death of a
sister, and the lieutenant left her three
hundred in his will. These sums she has
more than doubled, by living free of all
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
expence, in her brother's house; and deal∣ing
in cheese and Welsh flannel, the pro∣duce
of his flocks and dairy. At present
her capital is increased to about four
thousand pounds; and her avarice seems
to grow every day more and more rapa∣cious:
but even this is not so intolerable,
as the perverseness of her nature, which
keeps the whole family in disquiet and
uproar. She is one of those geniuses
who find some diabolical enjoyment in
being dreaded and detested by their fel∣low-creatures.</P>
<P>I once told my uncle, I was surprised
that a man of his disposition could bear
such a domestic plague, when it could be
so easily removed—The remark made
him sore, because it seemed to tax him
with want of resolution—Wrinkling up
his nose, and drawing down his eye∣brows,
“A young fellow, (said he) when
he first thrusts his snout into the world,
is apt to be surprised at many things,
which a man of experience knows to be
ordinary and unavoidable—This pre∣cious
aunt of yours is become insen∣sibly
a part of my constitution—Damn
her! She's a <HI>noli me tangere</HI> in my flesh,
which I cannot bear to be touched or
tampered with.” I made no reply;
<PB N="127" REF="140"/>
but shifted the conversation. He real∣ly
has an affection for this original; which
maintains its ground in defiance of com∣mon
sense, and in despite of that con∣tempt
which he must certainly feel for her
character and understanding. Nay, I
am convinced, that she has likewise a
most virulent attachment to his person;
though her love never shews itself but in
the shape of discontent; and she persists in
tormenting him, out of sheer tenderness—
The only object within doors upon which
she bestows any marks of affection, in the
usual stile, is her dog Chowder; a filthy
cur from Newfoundland, which she had
in a present from the wife of a skipper
in Swansey—One would imagine she had
distinguished this beast with her favour
on account of his ugliness and ill-nature;
if it was not, indeed, an instinctive sym∣pathy
between his disposition and her
own. Certain it is, she caresses him with∣out
ceasing; and even harrasses the fa∣mily
in the service of this cursed animal,
which, indeed, has proved the proximate
cause of her breach with Sir Ulic Mackil∣ligut.</P>
<P>You must know, she yesterday wanted to
steal a march of poor Liddy, and went to
breakfast in the Room without any other
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
companion than her dog, in expectation
of meeting with the Baronet, who had
agreed to dance with her in the evening—
Chowder no sooner made his appearance
in the Room, than the Master of the Ce∣remonies,
incensed at his presumption,
ran up to drive him away, and threatened
him with his foot; but the other seemed
to despise his authority, and displaying
a formidable case of long, white, sharp
teeth, kept the puny monarch at bay—
While he stood under some trepidation,
fronting his antagonist, and bawling to
the waiter, Sir Ulic Macklilligut came to
his assistance; and seeming ignorant of
the connexion between this intruder and
his mistress, gave the former such a kick
in the jaws, as sent him howling to the
door—Mrs. Tabitha, incensed at this
outrage, ran after him, squalling in a
tone equally disagreeable; while the Ba∣ronet
followed her on one side, making
apologies for his mistake; and Derrick
on the other, making remonstrances
upon the rules and regulations of the
place.</P>
<P>Far from being satisfied with the
Knight's excuses, she said she was sure he
was no gentleman; and when the Master
of the Ceremonies offered to hand her in∣to
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
the chair, she rapped him over the
knuckles with her fan. My uncle's foot∣man
being still at the door, she and
Chowder got into the same vehicle, and
were carried off amidst the jokes of the
chairmen and other populace—I had
been riding out on Clerkendown, and
happened to enter just as the <HI>fracas</HI> was
over—The Baronet, coming up to me
with an affected air of chagrin, recounted
the adventure; at which I laughed
heartily, and then his countenance clear∣ed
up. “My dear soul, (said he) when
I saw a sort of a wild baist, snar∣ling
with open mouth at the Master
of the Ceremonies, like the red cow go∣ing
to devour Tom Thumb, I could
do no less than go to the assistance of
the little man; but I never dreamt the
baist was one of Mrs. Bramble's atten∣dants—O!
if I had, he might have
made his breakfast upon Derrick and
wellcome—But, you know, my dear
friend, how natural it is for us Irish∣men
to blunder, and to take the wrong
sow by the ear—However, I will con∣fess
judgment, and cry her mercy;
and, 'tis to be hoped, a penitent sinner
may be forgiven.” I told him, that
as the offence was not involuntary of his
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
side, it was to be hoped he would not
find her implacable.</P>
<P>But, in truth, all this concern was dis∣sembled.
In his approaches of gallantry
to Mrs. Tabitha, he had been misled by a
mistake of at least six thousand pounds,
in the calculation of her fortune; and in
this particular he was just undeceived.
He, therefore, seized the first opportuni∣ty
of incurring her displeasure decently,
in such a manner as would certainly anni∣hilate
the correspondence; and he could
not have taken a more effectual method,
than that of beating her dog. When he
presented himself at our door, to pay his
respects to the offended fair, he was re∣fused
admittance; and given to under∣stand,
that he should never find her at
home for the future. She was not so in∣accessible
to Derrick, who came to de∣mand
satisfaction for the insult she had
offered to him, even in the verge of his
own court. She knew it was convenient
to be well with the Master of the Cere∣monies,
while she continued to frequent
the Rooms; and, having heard he was a
poet, began to be afraid of making her
appearance in a ballad or lampoon.—She
therefore made excuses for what she had
done, imputing it to the flutter of her
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
spirits; and subscribed handsomely for
his poems: so that he was perfectly ap∣peased,
and overwhelmed her with a pro∣fusion
of compliment. He even solicited
a reconciliation with Chowder; which,
however, the latter declined; and he de∣clared,
that if he could find a precedent
in the annals of the Bath, which he
would carefully examine for that purpose,
her favourite should be admitted to the
next public breakfasting—But, I believe,
she will not expose herself or him to the
risque of a second disgrace—Who will
supply the place of Mackilligut in her af∣fections,
I cannot foresee; but nothing
in the shape of man can come amiss.
Though she is a violent church-woman,
of the most intolerant zeal, I believe in
my conscience she would have no ob∣jection,
at present, to treat on the score
of matrimony with an Anapabtist, Qua∣ker,
or Jew; and even ratify the treaty,
at the expence of her own conversion.
But, perhaps, I think too hardly of this
kinswoman; who, I must own, is very
little beholden to the good opinion of</P>

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.</OPENER>
<P>YOU ask me, why I don't take the
air a-horseback, during this fine weather?
—In which of the avenues of this para∣dise
would you have me take that exer∣cise?
Shall I commit myself to the high∣roads
of London or Bristol, to be stifled
with dust, or pressed to death in the midst
of post-chaises, flying-machines, waggons,
and coal-horses; besides the troops of
fine gentlemen that take to the high-way,
to shew their horsemanship; and the
coaches of fine ladies, who go thither to
shew their equipages? Shall I attempt the
Downs, and fatigue myself to death in
climbing up an eternal ascent, without any
hopes of reaching the summit? Know
then, I have made divers desperate leaps
at those upper regions; but always fell
backward into this vapour-pit, exhausted
and dispirited by those ineffectual efforts;
and here we poor valetudinarians pant and
struggle, like so many Chinese gudgeons,
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
gasping in the bottom of a punch-bowl.
By Heaven, it is a kind of inchantment!
If I do not speedily break the spell, and
escape, I may chance to give up the ghost
in this nauseous stew of corruption—It
was but two nights ago, that I had like
to have made my public exit, at a minute's
warning. One of my greatest weaknesses
is that of suffering myself to be over-ruled
by the opinion of people, whose judg∣ment
I despise—I own, with shame and
confusion of face, that importunity of
any kind I cannot resist. This want of
courage and constancy is an original flaw
in my nature, which you must have of∣ten
observed with compassion, if not with
contempt. I am afraid some of our
boasted virtues may be traced up to this
defect.—</P>
<P>Without further preamble, I was per∣suaded
to go to a ball, on purpose to see
Liddy dance a minuet with a young pe∣tulant
jackanapes, the only son of a
wealthy undertaker from London, whose
mother lodges in our neighbourhood, and
has contracted an acquaintance with Tab∣by.
I sat a couple of long hours, half
stifled, in the midst of a noisome crowd;
and could not help wondering, that so
many hundreds of those that rank as ra∣tional
<PB N="134" REF="147"/>
creatures, could find entertain∣ment
in seeing a succession of insipid ani∣mals,
describing the same dull figure for
a whole evening, on an area, not much
bigger than a taylor's shop-board. If
there had been any beauty, grace, acti∣vity,
magnificent dress, or variety of any
kind, howsoever absurd, to engage the
attention, and amuse the fancy, I should
not have been surprised; but there was
no such object: it was a tiresome repeti∣tion
of the same languid, frivolous scene,
performed by actors that seemed to sleep
in all their motions—The continual
swimming of those phantoms before
my eyes, gave me a swimming of the
head; which was also affected by the
fouled air, circulating through such a
number of rotten human bellows—I
therefore retreated towards the door, and
stood in the passage to the next room,
talking to my friend Quin; when an end
being put to the minuets, the benches
were removed to make way for the coun∣try-dances;
and the multitude rising at
once, the whole atmosphere was put in
commotion. Then, all of a sudden,
came rushing upon me an Egyptian gale,
so impregnated with pestilential vapours,
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
that my nerves were overpowered, and I
dropt senseless upon the floor.</P>
<P>You may easily conceive what a cla∣mour
and confusion this accident must
have produced, in such an assembly—I
soon recovered, however, and found my∣self
in an easy chair, supported by my
own people—Sister Tabby, in her great
tenderness, had put me to the torture,
squeezing my head under her arm, and
stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn,
till the whole inside was excoriated, I
no sooner got home, that I sent for doc∣tor
Ch—, who assured me, I need∣ed
not be alarmed, for my swooning was
entirely occasioned by an accidental im∣pression
of fetid effluvia upon nerves of
uncommon sensibility. I know not how
other people's nerves are constructed;
but one would imagine they must be made
of very coarse materials, to stand the
shock of such a horrid assault. It was,
indeed, <HI>a compound of villainous smells,</HI> in
which the most violent stinks, and the
most powerful perfumes, contended for
the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high
exalted essence of mingled odours, arising
from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs,
four flatulencies, rank arm-pits, sweat∣ing
feet, running sores and issues, plas∣ters,
ointments, and embrocations, hun∣gary-water,
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
spirit of lavender, assafoetida
drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal volatile;
besides a thousand frowzy steams, which
I could not analyse. Such, O Dick! is
the fragrant aether we breathe in the po∣lite
assemblies of Bath—Such is the at∣mosphere
I have exchanged for the pure,
elastic, animating air of the Welsh moun∣tains—<HI>O
Rus, quando te aspiciam!</HI>—I
wonder what the devil possessed me—</P>
<P>But few words are best: I have taken
my resolution—You may well suppose I
don't intend to entertain the company
with a second exhibition—I have promis∣ed,
in an evil hour, to proceed to Lon∣don,
and that promise shall be perform∣ed;
but my stay in the metropolis shall
be brief. I have, for the benefit of my
health, projected an expedition to the
North, which, I hope, will afford some
agreeable pastime. I have never travel∣led
farther that way than Scarborough;
and, I think, it is a reproach upon me,
as a British freeholder, to have lived so
long without making an excursion to the
other side of the Tweed. Besides, I have
some relations settled in Yorkshire, to
whom it may not be improper to introduce
my nephew and his sister—At present, I
have nothing to add, but that Tabby is
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
happily disentangled from the Irish Ba∣ronet;
and that I will not fail to make
you acquainted, from time to time, with

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>A FEW days ago we were terribly
alarmed by my uncle's fainting at the
ball—He has been ever since cursing his
own folly, for going thither at the request
of an impertinent woman. He declares,
he will sooner visit a house infected with
the plague, than trust himself in such a
nauseous spital for the future, for he
swears the accident was occasioned by the
stench of the crowd; and that he would
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
never desire a stronger proof of our being
made of very gross materials, than our
having withstood the annoyance, by
which he was so much discomposed. For
my part, I am very thankful for the
coarseness of my organs, being in no dan∣ger
of ever falling a sacrifice to the deli∣cacy
of my nose. Mr. Bramble is ex∣travagantly
delicate in all his sensations,
both of soul and body. I was informed
by Dr. Lewis, that he once fought a duel
with an officer of the horse-guards, for
turning a-side to the Park wall, on a ne∣cessary
occasion, when he was passing with
a lady under his protection. His blood
rises at every instance of insolence and
cruelty, even where he himself is no way
concerned; and ingratitude makes his
teeth chatter. On the other hand, the
recital of a generous, humane, or grate∣ful
action, never fails to draw from him
tears of approbation, which he is often
greatly distressed to conceal.</P>
<P>Yesterday, one Paunceford gave tea,
on particular invitation—This man, after
having been long buffetted by adversity,
went abroad; and Fortune, resolved to
make him amends for her former coy∣ness,
set him all at once up to the very
ears in affluence. He has now emerged
<PB N="139" REF="152"/>
from obscurity, and blazes out in all the
tinsel of the times. I don't find that he
is charged with any practices that the law
deems dishonest, or that his wealth has
made him arrogant and inaccessible; on
the contrary, he takes great pains to ap∣pear
affable and gracious. But they say,
he is remarkable for shrinking from his
former friendships, which were generally
too plain and home-spun to appear amidst
his present brilliant connexions; and that
he seems uneasy at sight of some old be∣nefactors,
whom a man of honour would
take pleasure to acknowledge—Be that
as it may, he had so effectually engaged
the company at Bath, that when I went
with my uncle to the coffee-house in the
evening, there was not a soul in the room
but one person, seemingly in years, who
sat by the fire, reading one of the papers.
Mr. Bramble, taking his station close by
him, “There is such a crowd and con∣fusion
of chairs in the passage to Simp∣son's,
(said he) that we could hardly
get along—I wish those minions of
fortune would fall upon more laudable
ways of spending their money.—I sup∣pose,
sir, you like this kind of enter∣tainment
as little as I do?” “I can't
say, I have any great relish for such en∣tertainments,”
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
answered the other,
without taking his eyes off the paper—
“Mr. Serle, (resumed my uncle) I beg
pardon for interrupting you; but I
can't resist the curiosity I have to know
if you received a card on this occa∣sion?”</P>
<P>The man seemed surprised at this ad∣dress,
and made some pause, as doubt∣ful
what answer he should make. “I
know my curiosity is impertinent, (ad∣ded
my uncle) but I have a particular
reason for asking the favour.” “If that
be the case, (replied Mr. Serle) I shall
gratify you without hesitation, by own∣ing,
that I have had no card. But,
give me leave, sir, to ask in my turn,
what reason you think I have to expect
such an invitation from the gentleman
who gives tea?” “I have my own
reasons; (cried Mr. Bamble, with some
emotion) and am convinced, more than
ever, that this Paunceford is a con∣temptible
fellow.” “Sir, (said the
other, laying down the paper) I have
not the honour to know you; but your
discourse is a little mysterious, and
seems to require some explanation.
The person you are pleased to treat so
cavalierly, is a gentleman of some con∣sequence
<PB N="141" REF="154"/>
in the community; and, for
aught you know, I may also have my
particular reasons for defending his
character—” “If I was not convin∣ced
of the contrary, (observed the
other) I should not have gone so far—”
“Let me tell you, sir, (said the stran∣ger,
raising his voice) you have gone
too far, in hazarding such reflec∣tions—”</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by my uncle;
who asked peevishly, if he was Don
Quixote enough, at this time of day, to
throw down his gauntlet as champion
for a man who had treated him with such
ungrateful neglect. “For my part, (ad∣ded
he) I shall never quarrel with you
again upon this subject; and what I
have said now, has been suggested as
much by my regard for you, as by my
contempt of him—” Mr. Serle, then
pulling off his spectacles, eyed uncle very
earnestly, saying, in a mitigated tone,
“Surely I am much obliged—Ah,
Mr. Bramble! I now recollect your
features, though I have not seen you
these many years.” “We might have
been less strangers to one another, (an∣swered
the 'squire) if our correspon∣dence
had not been interrupted, in
<PB N="142" REF="155"/>
consequence of a misunderstanding,
occasioned by this very—, but no
matter—Mr. Serle, I esteem your cha∣racter;
and my friendship, such as it
is, you may freely command.” “The
offer is too agreeable to be declined;
(said he) I embrace it very cordially;
and, as the first fruits of it, request
that you will change this subject,
which, with me, is a matter of pe∣culiar
delicacy.”</P>
<P>My uncle owned he was in the right,
and the discourse took a more general
turn. Mr. Serle passed the evening with
us at our lodgings; and appeared to be
intelligent, and even entertaining; but
his disposition was rather of a melancho∣ly
hue. My uncle says he is a man of
uncommon parts, and unquestioned pro∣bity:
that his sortune, which was origi∣nally
small, has been greatly hurt by a
romantic spirit of generosity, which he
has often displayed, even at the expence
of his discretion, in favour of worthless
individuals—That he had rescued
Paunceford from the lowest distress, when
he was bankrupt, both in means and re∣putation—That
he had espoused his in∣terests
with a degree of enthusiasm, broke
with several friends, and even drawn his
<PB N="143" REF="156"/>
sword against my uncle, who had parti∣cular
reasons for questioning the moral
character of the said Paunceford: that,
without Serle's countenance and assistance,
the other never could have embraced the
opportunity, which has raised him to this
pinnacle of wealth: that Paunceford, in
the first transports of his success, had writ∣ten,
from abroad, letters to different cor∣respondents,
owning his obligations to
Mr. Serle, in the warmest terms of ac∣knowledgment,
and declaring he con∣sidered
himself only as a factor for the
occasions of his best friend: that, without
doubt, he had made declarations of the
same nature to his benefactor himself,
though this last was always silent and re∣served
on the subject; but for some years,
those tropes and figures of rhetoric had
been disused: that, upon his return to
England, he had been lavish in his ca∣resses
to Mr. Serle, invited him to his
house, and pressed him to make it his
own: that he had overwhelmed him with
general professions, and affected to ex∣press
the warmest regard for him, in com∣pany
of their common acquaintance; so
that every body believed his gratitude
was as liberal as his fortune; and some
<PB N="144" REF="157"/>
went so far as to congratulate Mr. Serle
on both.</P>
<P>All this time Paunceford carefully and
artfully avoided particular discussions
with his old patron, who had too much
spirit to drop the most distant hint of
balancing the account of obligation:
that, nevertheless, a man of his feelings
could not but resent this shocking return
for all his kindness; and, therefore, he
withdrew himself from the connexion,
without coming to the least explanation,
or speaking a syllable on the subject to
any living soul; so that now their corre∣spondence
is reduced to a slight salute
with the hat, when they chance to meet
in any public place; an accident that
rarely happens, for their walks lie diffe∣rent
ways. Mr. Paunceford lives in a
palace, feeds upon dainties, is arrayed in
sumptuous apparel, appears in all the
pomp of equipage, and passes his time
among the nobles of the land. Serle
lodges in Stall-street, up two pair of stairs
backwards, walks a-foot in a Bath-rug,
eats for twelve shillings a-week, and
drinks water as a preservative against
the gout and gravel—Mark the vicissi∣tude.
Paunceford once resided in a gar∣ret;
<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
where he subsisted upon sheeps'-trot∣ters
and cow-heel, from which com∣mons
he was translated to the table of
Serle, that ever abounded with good∣chear;
until want of oeconomy and re∣tention,
reduced him to a slender annuity
in his decline of years, that scarce affords
the bare necessaries of life—Paunceford,
however, does him the honour to speak
of him still, with uncommon regard; and
to declare what pleasure it would give
him to contribute in any shape to his con∣venience:
“But you know, (he never
fails to add) he's a shy kind of a man
—And then such a perfect philosopher,
that he looks upon all superfluities with
the most sovereign contempt.”</P>
<P>Having given you this sketch of 'squire
Paunceford, I need not make any com∣ment
on his character, but leave it at the
mercy of your own reflection; from
which, I dare say, it will meet with as
little quarter as it has found with</P>

DEAR MOLLY,</OPENER>
<P>WE are all upon the ving—Hey for
London, girl!—Fecks! we have been
long enough here; for we're all turned
tipsy turvy—Mistress has excarded Sir
Ulic for kicking of Chowder; and I have
sent O Frizzle away, with a flea in his
ear—I've shewn him how little I minded
his tinsy and his long tail—A fellor, who
would think for to go, for to offer, to
take up with a dirty trollop under my
nose—I ketched him in the very fect,
coming out of the house-maids garret.—But
I have gi'en the dirty slut a siserary.
O Molly! the sarvants at Bath are devils
in garnet—They lite the candle at both
ends—Here's nothing but ginketting, and
wasting, and thieving, and tricking, and
trigging; and then they are never con∣tent—They
won't suffer the 'squire and
mistress to stay any longer; because they
<PB N="473" REF="160"/>
have been already above three weeks in
the house; and they look for a couple
of ginneys a-piece at our going away;
and this is a parquisite they expect every
month in the season; being as how no fa∣mily
has a right to stay longer than four
weeks in the same lodgings; and so the
cuck swears, she will pin the dish-clout
to mistress's tail; and the house-maid
vows, she'll put cowitch in master's bed,
if so be he don't discamp without furder
ado—I don't blame them for making
the most of their market, in the way of
vails and parquisites; and I defy the de∣vil
to say I am a tail-carrier, or ever
brought a poor sarvant into trouble—
But then they oft to have some con∣science,
in vronging those that be sar∣vants
like themselves—For you must no,
Molly, I missed three-quarters of blond
lace, and a remnant of muslin, and my
silver thimble; which was the gift of true
love: they were all in my work-basket,
that I left upon the table in the sarvants-hall,
when mistresses bell rung; but if
they had been under lock and kay,
'twould have been all the same; for there
are double keys to all the locks in Bath;
and they say as how the very teeth an't
safe in your head, if you sleep with your
<PB N="148" REF="161"/>
mouth open—And so says I to myself,
<HI>them things could not go without hands; and
so I'll watch their waters:</HI> and so I did
with a vitness; for then it was I found
Bett consarned with O Frizzle. And as
the cuck had thrown her slush at me, be∣cause
I had taken part with Chowder,
when he fit with the turnspit, I resolved
to make a clear kitchen, and throw some
of her fat into the fire. I ketched the
chare-woman going out with her load in
the morning, before she thought I was
up, and brought her to mistress with her
whole cargo—Marry, what do'st think she
had got in the name of God? Her
buckets were foaming full of our best
bear, and her lap was stuffed with a cold
tongue, part of a buttock of beef, half a
turkey, and a swinging lump of butter,
and the matter of ten mould kandles,
that had scarce ever been lit. The cuck
brazened it out, and said it was her rite
to rummage the pantry; and she was
ready for to go before the mare: that he
had been her potticary many years, and
would never think of hurting a poor sar∣vant,
for giving away the scraps of the
kitchen—I went another way to work

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>. of
Jesus college, Oxon.</OPENER>
<P>YOU are in the right, dear Phillips;
I don't expect regular answers to every
letter—I know a college-life is too cir∣cumscribed
to afford materials for such
quick returns of communication. For
my part, I am continually shifting the
scene, and surrounded with new objects;
some of which are striking enough. I
shall therefore conclude my journal for
your amusement; and though, in all ap∣pearance,
it will not treat of very impor∣tant
or interesting particulars, it may
prove, perhaps, not altogether uninstruc∣tive
and unentertaining.</P>
<P>The musick and entertainments of Bath
are over for this season; and all our gay
birds of passage have taken their flight to
Bristol-well, Tunbridge, Brighthelmstone,
Scarborough, Harrowgate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not a
soul is seen in this place, but a few bro∣ken-winded
parsons, waddling like so
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
many crows along the North Parade.
There is always a great shew of the cler∣gy
at Bath: none of your thin, puny,
yellow, hectic figures, exhausted with
abstinence and hard study, labouring un∣der
the <HI>morbi eruditorum;</HI> but great over∣grown
dignitaries and rectors, with rubi∣cund
noses and gouty ancles, or broad
bloated faces, dragging along great
swag bellies; the emblems of sloth and
indigestion—</P>
<P>Now we are upon the subject of par∣sons,
I must tell you a ludicrous adven∣ture,
which was atchieved the other day
by Tom Eastgate, whom you may re∣member
on the foundation of Queen's.
He had been very assiduous to pin himself
upon George Prankley, who was a
gentleman-commoner of Christ-church,
knowing the said Prankley was heir to a
considerable estate, and would have the
advowson of a good living, the incum∣bent
of which was very old and infirm.
He studied his passions, and flattered them
so effectually, as to become his compa∣nion
and counsellor; and, at last, obtained
of him a promise of the presentation, when
the living should fall. Prankley, on his
uncle's death, quitted Oxford, and made
his first appearance in the fashionable
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
world at London; from whence he came
lately to Bath, where he has been exhi∣biting
himself among the bucks and
gamesters of the place. Eastgate followed
him hither; but he should not have quit∣ted
him for a moment, at his first emer∣ging
into life. He ought to have known
he was a fantastic, foolish, fickle fellow,
who would forget his college-attachments
the moment they ceased appealing to his
senses. Tom met with a cold reception
from his old friend; and was, moreover,
informed, that he had promised the liv∣ing
to another man, who had a vote in
the county, where he proposed to offer
himself a candidate at the next general
election. He now remembered nothing
of Eastgate, but the freedoms he had
used to take with him, while Tom had
quietly stood his butt, with an eye to the
benefice; and those freedoms he began
to repeat in common place sarcasms on
his person and his cloth, which he utter∣ed
in the public coffee-house, for the en∣tertainment
of the company. But he
was egregiously mistaken in giving his
own wit credit for that tameness of East∣gate,
which had been entirely owing to
prudential considerations. These being
now removed, he retorted his repartee
<PB N="153" REF="166"/>
with interest, and sound no great diffi∣culty
in turning the laugh upon the ag∣gressor;
who, losing his temper, called
him names, and asked, <HI>If he knew whom
he talked to?</HI> After much altercation,
Prankley, shaking his cane, bid him hold
his tongue, otherwise he would dust his
cassock for him. “I have no pretensi∣ons
to such a valet; (said Tom) but if
you should do me that office, and over∣heat
yourself, I have here a good
oaken towel at your service.”</P>
<P>Prankley was equally incensed and con∣founded
at this reply. After a moment's
pause, he took him aside towards the
window; and, pointing to the clump of
firs on Clerken-down, asked in a whisper,
if he had spirit enough to meet him there,
with a case of pistols, at six o'clock to∣morrow
morning. Eastgate answered in
the affirmative; and, with a steady coun∣tenance,
assured him, he would not fail to
give him the rendezvous at the hour he
mentioned. So saying, he retired; and
the challenger stayed some time in mani∣fest
agitation. In the morning, East∣gate,
who knew his man, and had taken
his resolution, went to Prankley's lodg∣ings,
and roused him by sive o'clock—</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="167"/>
The 'squire, in all probability, cursed
his punctuality in his heart, but he af∣fected
to talk big; and having prepared
his artillery over-night, they crossed the
water at the end of the South Parade. In
their progress up the hill, Prankley often
eyed the parson, in hopes of perceiving
some reluctance in his countenance; but
as no such marks appeared, he attempted
to intimidate him by word of mouth.
“If these flints do their office, (said he)
I'll do thy business in a few minutes.”
“I desire you will do your best; (re∣plied
the other) for my part, I come
not here to trifle. Our lives are in the
hands of God; and one of us already
totters on the brink of eternity—”
This remark seemed to make some im∣pression
upon the 'squire, who changed
countenance, and with a faultering ac∣cent
observed, “That it ill became a
clergyman to be concerned in quarrels
and blood-shed—” “Your insolence
to me (said Eastgate) I should have
bore with patience, had not you cast
the most infamous reflections upon my
order, the honour of which I think
myself in duty bound to maintain,
even at the expence of my heart's
blood; and surely it can be no crime
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
to put out of the world a profligate
wretch, without any sense of principle,
morality, or religion—” “Thou
may'st take away my life, (cried
Prankley, in great perturbation) but
don't go to murder my character.—
What! has't got no conscience?”
“My conscience is perfectly quiet (re∣plied
the other); and now, sir, we are
upon the spot—Take your ground as
near as you please; prime your pistol;
and the Lord, of his infinite mercy,
have compassion upon your miserable
soul!”</P>
<P>This ejaculation he pronounced in a
loud solemn tone, with his hat off, and
his eyes lifted up; then drawing a large
horse pistol, he presented, and put him∣self
in a posture of action. Prankley took
his distance, and endeavoured to prime,
but his hand shook with such violence,
that he found this operation impractible
—His antagonist, seeing how it was with
him, offered his assistance, and advanced
for that purpose; when the poor 'squire,
exceedingly alarmed at what he had
heard and seen, desired the action might
be deferred till next day, as he had not
settled his affairs. “I ha'n't made my
will (said he); my sisters are not pro∣vided
<PB N="156" REF="169"/>
for; and I just now recollect an
old promise, which my conscience tells
me I ought to perform—I'll first con∣vince
thee, that I'm not a wretch with∣out
principle, and then thou shalt
have an opportunity to take my life,
which thou seem'st to thirst after so
eagerly—”</P>
<P>Eastgate understood the hint; and told
him, that one day should break no
squares; adding, “God forbid that I
should be the means of hindering you
from acting the part of an honest man,
and a dutiful brother—” By virtue
of this cessation, they returned peaceably
together. Prankley forthwith made out
the presentation of the living, and deli∣vered
it to Eastgate, telling him at the
same time, he had now settled his affairs,
and was ready to attend him to the Fir∣grove;
but Tom declared he could not
think of lifting his hand against the life
of so great a benefactor—He did more:
when they next met at the coffee house,
he asked pardon of Mr. Prankley, if in
his passion he had said any thing to give
him offence; and the 'squire was so gra∣cious
as to forgive him with a cordial
shake of the hand, declaring that he
did not like to be at variance with an old
<PB N="157" REF="170"/>
college-companion—Next day, however,
he left Bath abruptly; and then East∣gate
told me all these particulars, not a
little pleased with the effects of his own
sagacity, by which he has secured a liv∣ing
worth 160 <HI>l. per annum.</HI></P>

<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DICK,</OPENER>
<P>I SHALL to-morrow set out for Lon∣don,
where I have bespoke lodgings, at
Mrs. Norton's in Golden-square. Al∣though
I am no admirer of Bath, I shall
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
leave it with regret; because I must part
with some old friends, whom, in all pro∣bability,
I shall never see again. In the
course of coffee-house conversation, I had
often heard very extraordinary enco∣miums
passes on the performances of Mr.
T—, a gentleman residing in this
place, who paints landscapes for his
amusement. As I have no great confi∣dence
in the taste and judgment of coffee-house
connoisseurs, and never received
much pleasure from this branch of the art,
those general praises made no impression
at all on my curiosity; but, at the request
of a particular friend, I went yesterday to
see the pieces, which had been so warmly
commended—I must own I am no judge
of painting, though very fond of pic∣tures.
I don't imagine that my senses
would play me so false, as to betray me
into admiration of any thing that was
very bad; but, true it is, I have often
over-looked capital beauties, in pieces
of extraordinary merit.—If I am not to∣tally
devoid of taste, however, this young
gentleman of Bath is the best landscape-painter
now living: I was struck with his
performances in such a manner, as I had
never been by painting before. His trees
not only have a richness of foliage and
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
warmth of colouring, which delights the
view; but also a certain magnificence in the
disposition, and spirit in the expression,
which I cannot describe. His manage∣ment
of the <HI>chiaro oscuro,</HI> or light and
shadow, especially gleams of shun-shine,
is altogether wonderful, both in the con∣trivance
and execution; and he is so hap∣py
in his perspective, and marking his
distances at sea, by a progressive series of
ships, vessels, capes, and promontories,
that I could not help thinking, I had a
distant view of thirty leagues upon the
back-ground of the picture. If there is
any taste for ingenuity left in a degene∣rate
age, fast sinking into barbarism, this
artist, I apprehend, will make a capital
figure, as soon as his works are known—</P>
<P>Two days ago, I was favoured with a
visit by Mr. Fitz-owen; who, with great
formality, solicited my vote and interest
at the general election. I ought not to
have been shocked at the confidence of
this man; though it was remarkable, con∣sidering
what had passed between him
and me on a former occasion—These
visits are mere matter of form, which a
candidate makes to every elector; even
to those who, he knows, are engaged in
the interest of his competitor, lest he
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
should expose himself to the imputation
of pride, at a time when it is expected he
should appear humble. Indeed, I know
nothing so abject as the behaviour of a
man canvassing for a seat in parliament
—This mean prostration, (to borough-electors,
especially) has, I imagine, con∣tributed
in a great measure to raise that
spirit of insolence among the vulgar;
which, like the devil, will be found very
difficult to lay. Be that as it may, I was
in some confusion at the effrontery of
Fitz-owen; but I soon recollected myself,
and told him, I had not yet determined
for whom I should give my vote, nor
whether I should give it for any.—The
truth is, I look upon both candidates in
the same light; and should think myself
a traitor to the constitution of my coun∣try,
if I voted for either. If every elec∣tor
would bring the same consideration
home to his conscience, we should not
have such reason to exclaim against the
venality of p—ts. But we are all a
pack of venal and corrupted rascals; so
lost to all sense of honesty, and all ten∣derness
of character, that, in a little time,
I am fully persuaded, nothing will be in∣famous
but virtue and public-spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174"/>
G. H—, who is really an enthusiast
in patriotism, and represented the capital
in several successive parliaments, declared
to me t'other day, with the tears in his
eyes, that he had lived above thirty years
in the city of London, and dealt in the
way of commerce with all the citizens of
note in their turns; but that, as he should
answer to God, he had never, in the
whole course of his life, found above
three or four whom he could call tho∣roughly
honest: a declaration, which was
rather mortifying than surprising to me;
who have found so few men of worth in
the course of my acquaintance, that they
serve only as exceptions; which, in the
grammarian's phrase, confirm and prove
a general canon—I know you will say,
G. H—saw imperfectly through the
mist of prejudice, and I am rankled
by the spleen—Perhaps, you are partly
in the right; for I have perceived that
my opinion of mankind, like mercury in
the thermometer, rises and falls accord∣ing
to the variations of the weather.</P>
<P>Pray settle accompts with Barnes;
take what money of mine is in his hands,
and give him acquittance. If you think
Davis has s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck or credit enough to do
justice to the farm, give him a discharge
<PB N="162" REF="175"/>
for the rent that is due: this will animate
his industry; for I know that nothing is
so discouraging to a farmer, as the
thoughts of being in arrears with his land∣lord.
He becomes dispirited, and ne∣glects
his labour; and so the farm goes
to wreck. Tabby has been clamouring
for some days about the lamb's skin,
which Williams, the hind, begged of
me, when he was last at Bath. Pr'ythee
take it back, paying the fellow the full
value of it, that I may have some peace
in my own house; and let him keep his
own counsel, if he means to keep his
place—O! I shall never presume to de∣spise
or censure any poor man, for suf∣fering
himself to be henpecked; con∣scious
how I myself am obliged to truckle
to a domestic daemon; even though
(blessed be God) she is not yoked with
me for life, in the matrimonial waggon
—She has quarrelled with the servants of
the house about vails; and such intoler∣able
scolding ensued on both sides, that
I have been fain to appease the cook and

<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>WITHOUT waiting for your answer
to my last, I proceed to give you an ac∣count
of our journey to London, which
has not been wholly barren of adventure.
Tuesday last, the 'squire took his place
in a hired coach and four, accompanied
by his sister and mine, and Mrs. Tabby's
maid, Winifrid Jenkins, whose province
it was to support Chowder on a cushion
in her lap. I could scarce refrain from
laughing, when I looked into the vehicle,
and saw that animal sitting opposite to my
uncle, like any other passenger. The
'squire, ashamed of his situation, blush∣ed
to the eyes: and, calling to the posti∣lions
to drive on, pulled the glass up in
my face. I, and his servant John Tho∣mas,
attended them on horseback.</P>
<P>Nothing worth mentioning occured,
till we arrived on the edge of Marlbo∣rough
<PB N="166" REF="179"/>
Downs. There one of the fore
horses fell, in going down hill at a round
trot; and the postilion behind, en∣deavouring
to stop the carriage, pulled it
on one side into a deep rut, where it was
fairly overturned. I had rode on about
two hundred yards before; but, hear∣ing
a loud scream, galloped back and
dismounted, to give what assistance was
in my power. When I looked into the
coach, I could see nothing distinctly, but
the nether end of Jenkins, who was kick∣ing
her heels and squalling with great
vociferation. All of a sudden, my un∣cle
thrust up his bare pate, and bolted
through t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e window, as nimble as a gras∣hopper,
having made use of poor Win's
posteriors as a step to rise in his ascent—
The man (who had likewise quitted his
horse) dragged this forlorn damsel, more
dead than alive, through the same open∣ing.
Then Mr. Bramble, pulling the
door off its hinges with a jerk, laid hold
on Liddy's arm, and brought her to the
light; very much frighted, but little
hurt. It fell to my share to deliver our
aunt Tabitha, who had lost her cap in
the struggle; and being rather more than
half frantic, with rage and terror, was
no bad representation of one of the sister
<PB N="167" REF="180"/>
Furies that guard the gates of hell—
She expressed no sort of concern for her
brother, who ran about in the cold, with∣out
his periwig, and worked with the
most astonishing agility, in helping to dis∣entangle
the horses from the carriage:
but she cried, in a tone of distraction,
“Chowder! Chowder! my dear Chow∣der!
my poor Chowder is certainly
killed!”</P>
<P>This was not the case—Chowder, af∣ter
having tore my uncle's leg in the con∣fusion
of the fall, had retreated under the
seat, and from thence the footman drew
him by the neck; for which good office,
he bit his fingers to the bone. The fel∣low,
who is naturally surly, was so pro∣voked
at this assault, that he saluted his
ribs with a hearty kick, exclaiming,
“Damn the nasty son of a bitch, and them
he belongs to!” A benediction, which
was by no means lost upon the implac∣able
virago his mistress—Her brother,
however, prevailed upon her, to retire
into a peasant's house, near the scene of
action, where his head and her's were
covered, and poor Jenkins had a fit—
Our next care was to apply some stick∣ing
plaster to the wound in his leg, which
exhibited the impression of Chowder's
<PB N="168" REF="181"/>
teeth; but he never opened his lips
against the delinquent—Mrs. Tabby,
alarmed at this scene, “You say nothing,
Matt (cried she); but I know your
mind—I know the spite you have to
that poor unfortunate animal! I know
you intend to take his life away!”
“You are mistaken, upon my honour!
(replied the 'squire, with a sarcastic
smile) I should be incapable of har∣bouring
any such cruel design against
an object so amiable and inoffensive;
even if he had not the happiness to be
your favourite.”</P>
<P>John Thomas was not so delicate. The
fellow, whether really alarmed for his
life, or instigated by the desire of re∣venge,
came in, and bluntly demanded,
that the dog should be put to death; on
the supposition, that if ever he should run
mad hereafter, he, who had been bit by
him, would be infected—My uncle calm∣ly
argued upon the absurdity of his opi∣nion,
observing, that he himself was in
the same predicament, and would cer∣tainly
take the precaution he proposed,
if he was not sure he ran no risque of in∣fection.
Nevertheless, Thomas continu∣ed
obstinate; and, at length declared,
that if the dog was not shot immediately,
<PB N="169" REF="182"/>
he himself would be his executioner—
This declaration opened the flood-gates
of Tabby's eloquence, which would have
shamed the first-rate oratress of Billings∣gate.
The footman retorted in the same
stile; and the 'squire dismissed him from
his service, after having prevented me
from giving him a good horse-whipping
for his insolence.</P>
<P>The coach being adjusted, another dif∣ficulty
occured—Mrs. Tabitha absolutely
refused to enter it again, unless another
driver could be found to take the place
of the position; who, she affirmed, had
overturned the carriage from malice a∣forethought—After
much dispute, the
man resigned his place to a shabby coun∣try
fellow, who undertook to go as far as
Marlborough, where they could be bet∣ter
provided; and at that place we ar∣rived
about one o'clock, without farther
impediment. Mrs. Bramble, however,
found new matter of offence; which, in∣deed,
she had a particular genius for ex∣tracting
at will from almost every inci∣dent
in life. We had scarce entered the
room at Marlborough, where we stayed
to dine, when she exhibited a formal
complaint against the poor fellow who
had superseded the postilion. She said,
<PB N="170" REF="183"/>
he was such a beggarly rascal, that he had
ne'er a shirt to his back; and had the
impudence to shock her sight by shew∣ing
his bare posteriors, for which act of
indelicacy he deserved to be set in the
flocks. Mrs. Winifred Jenkins confirm∣ed
the assertion, with respect to his naked∣ness,
observing, at the same time, that he
had a skin as fair as alabaster.</P>
<P>“This is a heinous offence, indeed,
(cried my uncle) let us hear what the
fellow has to say in his own vindica∣tion.”
He was accordingly summon∣ed,
and made his appearance, which was
equally queer and pathetic. He seemed
to be about twenty years of age, of a
middling size, with bandy legs, stoop∣ing
shoulders, high forehead, sandy locks,
pinking eyes, flat nose, and long chin—but
his complexion was of a sickly yel∣low:
his looks denoted famine; and the
rags that he wore, could hardly conceal
what decency requires to be covered—
My uncle, having surveyed him atten∣tively,
said, with an ironical expression in
his countenance, “An't you ashamed,
fellow, to ride postilion without a shirt
to cover your backside from the view
of the ladies in the coach?” “Yes,
I am, an please your noble honour;
<PB N="171" REF="184"/>
(answered the man) but necessity has
no law, as the saying is—And more
than that, it was an accident—My
breeches cracked behind, after I had
got into the saddle—” “You're an
impudent varlet, (cried Mrs. Tabby)
for presuming to ride before persons of
fashion without a shirt—” “I am
so, an please your worthy ladyship;
(said he) but I'am a poor Wiltshire lad,
—I ha'n't a shirt in the world, that I
can call my own, nor a rag of clothes,
an please your ladyship, but what you
see—I have no friend, nor relation up∣on
earth to help me out—I have had
the fever and ague these six months,
and spent all I had in the world upon
doctors, and to keep soul and body
together; and, saving your ladyship's
good presence, I han't broke bread
these four and twenty hours—”</P>
<P>Mrs. Bramble, turning from him, said,
she had never seen such a filthy tatterde∣malion,
and bid him begone; observ∣ing,
that he would fill the room full of
vermin—Her brother darted a significant
glance at her, as she retired with Liddy
into another apartment; and then asked
the man if he was known to any person
in Marlborough?—When he answered,
<PB N="172" REF="185"/>
that the landlord of the inn had known
him from his infancy; mine host was
immediately called, and being interroga∣ted
on the subject, declared that the
young fellow's name was Humphry Clin∣ker.
That he had been a love begotten
babe, brought up in the work-house, and
put out apprentice by the parish to a
country black-smith, who died before the
boy's time was out: that he had for some
time worked under his ostler, as a helper
and extra postilion, till he was taken ill
of the ague, which disabled him from
getting his bread: that, having sold or
pawned every thing he had in the world
for his cure and subsistence, he became
so miserable and shabby, that he disgraced
the stable, and was dismissed; but that
he never heard any thing to the prejudice
of his character in other respects. “So
that the fellow being sick and desti∣tute,
(said my uncle) you turned him
out to die in the streets.” “I pay the
poors' rate, (replied the other) and I
have no right to maintain id<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e va∣grants,
either in sickness or health;
besides, such a miserable object would
have brought a discredit upon my
house—”</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="186"/>
“You perceive (said the 'squire, turn∣ing
to me) our landlord is a Christian
of bowels—Who shall presume to cen∣sure
the morals of the age, when the
very publicans exhibit such examples
of humanity?—Heark ye, Clinker,
you are a most notorious offender—
You stand convicted of sickness, hun∣ger,
wretchedness, and want—But, as
it does not belong to me to punish cri∣minals,
I will only take upon me the
task of giving you a word of advice—
Get a shirt with all convenient dis∣patch,
that your nakedness may not
henceforward give offence to travelling
gentlewomen, especially maidens in
years—”</P>
<P>So saying, he put a guinea into the
hand of the poor fellow, who stood star∣ing
at him in silence, with his mouth
wide open, till the landlord pushed him
out of the room.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, as our aunt stept in∣to
the coach, she observed, with some
marks of satisfaction, that the postilion,
who rode next to her, was not a shabby
wretch like the ragamuffin who had drove
them into Marlborough. Indeed, the
difference was very conspicuous: this
was a smart fellow, with a narrow brim∣med
<PB N="174" REF="187"/>
hat, with gold cording, a cut bob,
a decent blue jacket, leather breeches, and
a clean linen shirt, puffed above the
waist-band. When we arrived at the
castle on Spin-hill, where we lay, this
new postilion was remarkably assiduous,
in bringing in the loose parcels; and, at
length, displayed the individual counte∣nance
of Humphry Clinker, who had
metamorposed himself in this manner, by
relieving from pawn part of his own
clothes, with the money he had received
from Mr. Bramble.</P>
<P>Howsoever pleased the rest of the com∣pany
were with such a favourable change
in the appearance of this poor creature,
it soured on the stomach of Mrs. Tabby,
who had not yet digested the affront of
his naked skin—She tossed her nose in
disdain, saying, she supposed her brother
had taken him into favour, because he
had insulted her with his obscenity: that
a fool and his money were soon parted;
but that if Matt intended to take the fel∣low
with him to London, she would not
go a-foot further that way—My uncle
said nothing with his tongue, though his
looks were sufficiently expressive; and
next morning Clinker did not appear,
so that we proceeded without further al∣tercation
<PB N="175" REF="188"/>
to Salt-hill, where we proposed
to dine—There, the first person that came
to the side of the coach, and began to
adjust the foot-board, was no other than
Humphry Clinker—When I handed out
Mrs. Bramble, she eyed him with a fu∣rious
look, and passed into the house—
My uncle was embarrassed, and asked him
peevishly, what had brought him hither?
The fellow said, his honour had been so
good to him, that he had not the heart to
part with him; that he would follow him
to the world's end, and serve him all the
days of his life, without fee or reward—</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble did not know whether to
chide or laugh at this declaration—He
foresaw much contradiction on the side of
Tabby; and, on the other hand, he could
not but be pleased with the gratitude of
Clinker, as well as with the simplicity of
his character—“Suppose I was inclined
to take you into my service, (said he)
what are your qualifications? what are
you good for?” “An please your
honour, (answered this original) I can
read and write, and do the business of
the stable indifferent well—I can dress
a horse, and shoe him, and bleed and
rowel him; and, as for the practice of
sow-gelding, I won't turn my back on
<PB N="176" REF="189"/>
e'er a he in the county of Wilts—
Then I can make hog's puddings and
hob-nails, mend kettles, and tin sauce∣pans—”
Here uncle burst out a-laugh∣ing;
and enquired, what other accom∣plishments
he was master of—“I know
something of single-stick, and psalmo∣dy,
(proceeded Clinker) I can play up∣on
the Jew's-harp, sing Black-ey'd
Susan, Arthur-o'Bradley, and divers
other songs; I can dance a Welsh jig,
and Nancy Dawson; wrestle a fall with
any lad of my inches, when I'm in
heart; and, under correction, I can
find a hare when your honour wants a
bit of game.” “Foregad! thou art
a complete fellow, (cried my uncle,
still laughing) I have a good mind to
take thee into my family—Pr'ythee,
go and try if thou can'st make peace
with my sister—Thou ha'st given her
much offence by shewing her thy naked
tail.”</P>
<P>Clinker accordingly followed us into
the room, cap in hand, where, addres∣sing
himself to Mrs. Tabitha, “May it
please your ladyship's worship (cried
he) to pardon and forgive my offences,
and, with God's assistance, I shall take
care that my tail shall never rise up in
<PB N="177" REF="190"/>
judgment against me, to offend your
ladyship again—Do, pray, good,
sweet, beautiful lady, take compassion
on a poor sinner—God bless your no∣ble
countenance; I am sure you are
too handsome and generous to bear
malice—I will serve you on my bend∣ed
knees, by night and by day, by
land and by water; and all for the
love and pleasure of serving such an ex∣cellent
lady—”</P>
<P>This compliment and humiliation had
some effect upon Tabby; but she made
no reply; and Clinker, taking silence for
consent, gave his attendance at dinner.
The fellow's natural aukwardness and
the flutter of his spirits were productive
of repeated blunders in the course of his
attendance—At length, he spilt part of a
custard upon her right shoulder; and,
starting back, trod upon Chowder, who
set up a dismal howl—Poor Humphry
was so disconcerted at this double mis∣take,
that he dropt the china dish, which
broke into a thousand pieces; then, fall∣ing
down upon his knees, remained in
that posture gaping, with a most ludi∣crous
aspect of distress—Mrs. Bramble
flew to the dog, and, snatching him in
her arms, presented him to her brother,
<PB N="178" REF="191"/>
saying, “This is all a concerted scheme
against this unfortunate animal, whose
only crime is its regard for me—Here
it is: kill it at once; and then you'll
be satisfied.”</P>
<P>Clinker, hearing these words, and tak∣ing
them in the literal acceptation, got
up in some hurry, and, seizing a knife
from the side-board, cried, “Not here,
an please your ladyship—It will daub
the room—Give him to me, and I'll
carry him in the ditch by the road∣side—”
To this proposal he receiv∣no
other answer, than a hearty box on the
ear, that made him stagger to the other
side of the room. “What! (said she to
her brother) am I to be affronted by
every mangy hound that you pick up
in the highway? I insist upon your
sending this rascallion about his busi∣ness
immediately—” “For God's
sake, sister, compose yourself, (said my
uncle) and consider, that the poor fel∣low
is innocent of any intention to give
you offence—” “Innocent as the babe
unborn”—(cried Humphry.) “I see
it plainly, (exclaimed this implacable
maiden) he acts by your direction; and
you are resolved to support him in his
impudence—This is a bad return for
<PB N="179" REF="192"/>
all the services I have done you; for
nursing you in your sickness, manag∣ing
your family, and keeping you
from ruining yourself by your own im∣prudence—But
now you shall part
with that rascal or me, upon the spot,
without farther loss of time; and the
world shall see whether you have more
regard for your own flesh and blood,
or for a beggarly foundling, taken
from the dunghill—”</P>
<P>Mr. Bramble's eyes began to glisten,
and his teeth to chatter. “If stated
fairly, (said he, raising his voice) the
question is, whether I have spirit to
shake off an intolerable yoke, by one
effort of resolution, or meanness
enough to do an act of cruelty and
injustice, to gratify the rancour of a
capricious woman—Heark ye, Mrs.
Tabitha Bramble, I will now propose
an alternative in my turn—Either dis∣card
your four-footed favourite, or
give me leave to bid you eternally
adieu—For I am determined, that he
and I shall live no longer under the
same roof: and now <HI>to dinner with
what appetite you may—</HI>” Thunder∣struck
at this declaration, she sat down in
a corner; and, after a pause of some
<PB N="180" REF="193"/>
minutes, “Sure I don't understand you,
Matt! (said she)” “And yet I spoke
in plain English—” answered the
squire, with a peremptory look. “Sir,
(resumed this virago, effectually hum∣bled)
it is your prerogative to com∣mand,
and my duty to obey. I can't
dispose of the dog in this place; but
if you'll allow him to go in the coach
to London, I give you my word, he
shall never trouble you again—”</P>
<P>Her brother, entirely disarmed by this
mild reply, declared, she could ask
him nothing in reason that he would re∣fuse;
adding, “I hope, sister, you have
never found me deficient in natural
affection.” Mrs. Tabitha immediate∣ly
rose, and, throwing her arms about
his neck, kissed him on the cheek: he
returned her embrace with great emotion.
Liddy sobbed, Win Jenkins cackled,
Chowder capered, and Clinker skipped
about, rubbing his hands for joy of this
reconciliation.</P>
<P>Concord being thus restored, we fi∣nished
our meal with comfort; and in the
evening arrived at London, without hav∣ing
met with any other adventure. My
aunt seems to be much mended by the
hint she received from her brother. She
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>
has been graciously pleased to remove her
displeasure from Clinker, who is now re∣tained
as a footman; and in a day or two
will make his appearance in a new suit of
livery; but as he is little acquainted with
London, we have taken an occasional
valet, whom I intend hereafter to hire as
my own servant. We lodge in Golden-square,
at the house of one Mrs. Norton,
a decent sort of a woman, who takes
great pains to make us all easy. My un∣cle
proposes to make a circuit of all the
remarkable scenes of this metropolis, for
the entertainment of his pupils; but as
both you and I are already acquainted
with most of those he will visit, and with
some others he little dreams of, I shall
only communicate what will be in some
measure new to your observation. Re∣member

<LETTER>
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>
<OPENER>To Dr. LEWIS.
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>LONDON is literally new to me; new
in its streets, houses, and even in its situ∣ation;
as the Irishman said, “London is
now gone out of town.” What I left
open fields, producing hay and corn, I
now find covered with streets, and squares,
and palaces, and churches. I am credi∣bly
informed, that in the space of seven
years, eleven thousand new houses have
been built in one quarter of Westminster,
exclusive of what is daily added to other
parts of this unweildy metropolis. Pim∣lico
and Knightsbridge are now almost
joined to Chel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea and Kensington; and if
this infatuation continues for half a cen∣tury,
I suppose the whole county of Mid∣dlesex
will be covered with brick.</P>
<P>It must be allowed, indeed, for the
credit of the present age, that London
and Westminster are much better paved
and lighted than they were formerly.
<PB N="183" REF="196"/>
The new streets are spacious, regular,
and airy; and the houses generally con∣venient.
The bridge at Blackfriars is a
noble monument of taste and public-spi∣rit—I
wonder how they stumbled upon
a work of such magnificence and utility.
But, notwithstanding these improvements,
the capital is become an overgrown mon∣ster;
which, like a dropsical head, will
in time leave the body and extremities
without nourishment and support. The
absurdity will appear in its full force,
when we consider, that one sixth part of
the natives of this whole extensive king∣dom,
is crowded within the bills of mor∣tality.
What wonder that our villages
are depopulated, and our farms in want
of day-labourers? The abolition of small
farms, is but one cause of the decrease of
population. Indeed, the incredible in∣crease
of horses and black cattle, to an∣swer
the purposes of luxury, requires a
prodigious quantity of hay and grass,
which are raised and managed without
much labour; but a number of hands
will always be wanted for the different
branches of agriculture, whether the
farms be large or small. The tide of
luxury has swept all the inhabitants fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
the open country—The poorest 'square,
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>
as well as the richest peer, must have his
house in town, and make a figure with an
extraordinary number of domestics. The
plough-boys, cow-herds, and lower hinds,
are debauched and seduced by the ap∣pearance
and discourse of those coxcombs
in livery, when they make their summer
excursions. They desert their dirt and
drudgery, and swarm up to London, in
hopes of getting into service, where they
can live luxuriously and wear fine clothes,
without being obliged to work; for idle∣ness
is natural to man—Great numbers
of these, being disappointed in their ex∣pectation,
become thieves and sharpers;
and London being an immense wilder∣ness,
in which there is neither watch nor
ward of any signification, nor any order
or police, affords them lurking-places as
well as prey.</P>
<P>There are many causes that contribute
to the daily increase of this enormous
mass; but they may be all resolved into
the grand source of luxury and corrup∣tion—About
five and twenty years ago,
very few, even of the most opulent ci∣tizens
of London, kept any equipage, or
even any servants in livery. Their ta∣bles
produced nothing but plain boiled
and roasted, with a bottle of port and a
<PB N="185" REF="198"/>
tankard of beer. At present, every trader
in any degree of credit, every broker
and attorney, maintains a couple of foot∣men,
a coachman, and postilion. He has
his town-house, and his country-house,
his coach, and his postchaise. His wife
and daughters appear in the richest stuffs,
bespangled with diamonds. They fre∣quent
the court, the opera, the theatre,
and the masquerade. They hold assem∣blies
at their own houses: they make
sumptuous entertainments, and treat with
the richest wines of Bourdeaux, Burgun∣dy,
and Champagne. The substantial
tradesman, who wont to pass his evenings
at the ale-house for fourpence half-penny,
now spends three shillings at the tavern,
while his wife keeps card-tables at home;
she must likewise have fine clothes, her
chaise, or pad, with country lodgings,
and go three times a-week to public di∣versions.
Every clerk, apprentice, and
even waiter of tavern or coffee-house,
maintains a gelding by himself, or in
partnership, and assumes the air and ap∣parel
of a petit maitre—The gayest
places of public entertainment are filled
with fashionable figures; which, upon
inquiry, will be found to be journeymen
<PB N="186" REF="199"/>
taylors, serving-men, and abigails, dis∣guised
like their betters.</P>
<P>In short, there is no distinction or sub∣ordination
left—The different depart∣ments
of life are jumbled together—The
hod-carrier, the low mechanic, the tap∣ster,
the publican, the shop-keeper, the
pettifogger, the citizen, and courtier, <HI>all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>read upon the kibes of one another:</HI> ac∣tuated
by the demons of profligacy and
licentiousness, they are seen every where,
rambling, riding, rolling, rushing, justling,
mixing, bouncing, cracking, and crashing
in one vile ferment of stupidity and corrup∣tion—All
is tumult and hurry; one would
imagine they were impelled by some dis∣order
of the brain, that will not suffer
them to be at rest. The foot-passengers
run along as if they were pursued by
bailiffs. The porters and chairmen trot
with their burthens. People, who keep
their own equipages, drive through the
streets at full speed. Even citizens, phy∣sicians,
and apothecaries, glide in their
chariots like lightning. The hackney-coachmen
make their horses smoke, and
the pavement shakes under them; and I
have actually seen a waggon pass through
Piccadilly at the hand-gallop. In a word,
<PB N="187" REF="200"/>
the whole nation seems to be running out
of their wits.</P>
<P>The diversions of the times are not ill
suited to the genius of this incongrous
monster, called <HI>the public.</HI> Give it noise,
confusion, glare, and glitter; it has no
idea of elegance and propriety—What are
the amusements at Ranelagh? One half
of the company are following one an∣other's
tails, in an eternal circle; like so
many blind asses in an olive-mill, where
they can neither discourse, distinguish,
nor be distinguished; while the other
half are drinking hot water, under the
denomination of tea, till nine or ten
o'clock at night, to keep them awake
for the rest of the evening. As for the
orchestra, the vocal musick especially, it
is well for the performers that they can∣not
be heard distinctly. Vauxhall is a
composition of baubles, overcharged with
paltry ornaments, ill conceived, and
poorly executed; without any unity of
design, or propriety of disposition. It
is an unnatural assembly of objects, fan∣tastically
illuminated in broken masses;
seemingly contrived to dazzle the eyes
and divert the imagination of the vul∣gar—Here
a wooden lion, there a stone
statue; in one place, a range of things
<PB N="188" REF="201"/>
like coffee-house boxes, covered a-top;
in another, a parcel of ale-house benches;
in a third, a puppet-shew representation
of a tin cascade; in a fourth, a gloomy
cave of a circular form, like a sepulchral
vault half lighted; in a fifth, a scanty
slip of grass-plat, that would not afford
pasture sufficient for an ass's colt. The
walks, which nature seems to have in∣tended
for solitude, shade, and silence,
are filled with crowds of noisy people,
sucking up the nocturnal rheums of an
aguish climate; and through these gay
scenes, a few lamps glimmer like so
many farthing candles.</P>
<P>When I see a number of well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dressed
people, of both sexes, sitting on the co∣vered
benches, exposed to the eyes of the
mob; and, which is worse, to the cold,
raw, night-air, devouring sliced beef, and
swilling port, and punch, and cyder, I
can't help compassionating their temeri∣ty,
while I despise their want of taste and
decorum; but, when they course along
those damp and gloomy walks, or crowd
together upon the wet gravel, without
any other cover than the cope of Hea∣ven,
listening to a song, which one half
of them cannot possibly hear, how can I
help supposing they are actually possessed
<PB N="189" REF="202"/>
by a spirit, more absurd and pernicious
than any thing we meet with in the pre∣cincts
of Bedlam? In all probability, the
proprietors of this, and other public gar∣dens
of inferior note, in the skirts of the
metropolis, are, in some shape, connect∣ed
with the faculty of physic, and the
company of undertakers; for, consider∣ing
that eagerness in the pursuit of what
is called pleasure, which now predomi∣nates
through every rank and denomina∣tion
of life, I am persuaded, that more
gouts, rheumatisms, catarrhs, and con∣sumptions
are caught in these nocturnal
pastimes, <HI>sub dio,</HI> than from all the
risques and accidents to which a life of
toil and danger is exposed.</P>
<P>These, and other observations, which I
have made in this excursion, will shorten
my stay at London, and send me back
with a double relish to my solitude and
mountains; but I shall return by a diffe∣rent
route from that which brought me to
town. I have seen some old friends, who
constantly resided in this virtuous metro∣polis,
but they are so changed in man∣ners
and disposition, that we hardly know
or care for one another—In our journey
from Bath, my sister Tabby provoked me
into a transport of passion; during which,
<PB N="190" REF="203"/>
like a man who has drank himself pot-valiant,
I talked to her in such a stile of
authority and resolution, as produced a
most blessed effect. She and her dog
have been remarkably quiet and orderly,
ever since this expostulation. How long
this agreeable calm will last, Heaven
above knows—I flatter myself, the exer∣cise
of travelling has been of service to
my health; a circumstance, which en∣courages
me to proceed in my projected
expedition to the North. But I must,
in the mean time, for the benefit and
amusement of my pupils, explore the
depths of this chaos; this mishapen and
monstrous capital, without head or tail,
members or proportion.</P>
<P>Thomas was so insolent to my sister on
the road, that I was obliged to turn him
off abruptly, betwixt Chippenham and
Marlborough, where our coach was over∣turned.
The fellow was always sullen
and selfish; but, if he should return to
the country, you may give him a cha∣racter
for honesty and sobriety; and, pro∣vided

the family, let him have a couple of

<PB N="191" REF="204"/>
<OPENER>To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.
MY DEAR LETTY,</OPENER>
<P>INEXPRESSIBLE was the pleasure
I received from yours of the 25th, which
was last night put into my hands by Mrs.
Brentwood, the milliner, from Gloucester
—I rejoice to hear that my worthy go∣verness
is in good health, and, still more,
that she no longer retains any displeasure
towards her poor Liddy. I am sorry you
have lost the society of the agreeable miss
Vaughan; but, I hope, you won't have
cause much longer to regret the depar∣ture
of your school companions, as I
make no doubt but your parents will,
in a little time, bring you into the world,
where you are so well qualified to make a
distinguished figure. When that is the
case, I flatter myself you and I shall meet
again, and be happy together; and even
improve the friendship which we contract∣ed
in our tender years—This at least I
can promise—It shall not be for the want
<PB N="192" REF="205"/>
of my utmost endeavours, if our inti∣macy
does not continue for life.</P>
<P>About five days ago we arrived in Lon∣don,
after an easy journey from Bath;
during which, however, we were over∣turned,
and met with some other little
incidents, which had like to have occa∣sioned
a misunderstanding betwixt my un∣cle
and aunt; but now, thank God, they
are happily reconciled: we live in har∣mony
together, and every day make par∣ties
to see the wonders of this vast metro∣polis,
which, however, I cannot pretend
to describe; for I have not as yet seen
one hundredth part of its curiosities, and
I am quite in a maze of admiration.</P>
<P>The cities of London and Westminster
are spread out into an incredible extent.
The streets, squares, rows, lanes, and
alleys, are innumerable. Palaces, pub∣lic
buildings, and churches, rise in every
quarter; and, among these last, St. Paul's
appears with the most astonishing pre∣eminence.
They say it is not so large as
St. Peter's at Rome; but, for my own
part, I can have no idea of any earthly
temple more grand and magnificent.</P>
<P>But even these superb objects are not
so striking as the crowds of people that
swarm in the streets. I at first imagined,
<PB N="193" REF="206"/>
that some great assembly was just dismiss∣ed,
and wanted to stand aside till the
multitude should pass; but this human
tide continues to flow, without interrup∣tion
or abatement, from morn till night.
Then there is such an infinity of gay
equipages, coaches, chariots, chaises, and
other carriages, continually rolling and
shifting before your eyes, that one's head
grows giddy looking at them; and the
imagination is quite confounded with
splendour and variety. Nor is the pro∣spect
by water less grand and astonishing
than that by land: you see three stu∣pendous
bridges, joining the opposite
banks of a broad, deep, and rapid
river; so vast, so stately, so elegant, that
they seem to be the work of the giants:
betwixt them, the whole surface of the
Thames is covered with small vessels,
barges, boats, and wherries, passing to

Ranelagh looks like the inchanted pa∣lace
of a genie, adorned with the most
exquisite performances of painting, carv∣ing,
and gilding, enlightened with a
thousand golden lamps, that emulate the
noon-day sun; crowded with the great,
the rich, the gay, the happy, and the
fair; glittering with cloth of gold and
silver, lace, embroidery, and precious
stones. While these exulting sons and
daughters of felicity tread this round of
pleasure, or regale in different parties,
and separate lodges, with fine imperial
tea and other delicious refreshments, their
ears are entertained with the most ravish∣ing
delights of musick, both instrumen∣tal
and vocal. There I heard the fa∣mous
Tenducci, a thing from Italy—It
looks for all the world like a man, though
they say it is not. The voice, to be sure,
is neither man's nor woman's; but it is
more melodious than either; and it war∣bled
so divinely, that, while I listened, I
really thought myself in paradise.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock, in a charming moon∣light
evening, we embarked at Ranelagh
for Vauxhall, in a wherry, so light and
slender, that we looked like so many
fairies sailing in a nut-shell. My uncle,
being apprehensive of catching cold upon
<PB N="195" REF="208"/>
the water, went round in the coach, and
my aunt would have accompanied him,
but he would not suffer me to go by wa∣ter
if she went by land; and therefore she
favoured us with her company, as she
perceived I had a curiosity to make this
agreeable voyage—After all, the vessel
was sufficiently loaded; for, besides the
waterman, there was my brother Jery,
and a friend of his, one Mr. Barton, a
country gentleman, of a good fortune,
who had dined at our house—The plea∣sure
of this little excursion was, how∣ever,
damped, by my being sadly fright∣ed
at our landing; where there was a
terrible confusion of wherries, and a
crowd of people bawling, and swearing,
and quarrelling: nay, a parcel of ugly-looking
fellows came running into the
water, and laid hold on our boat with
great violence, to pull it a-shore; nor
would they quit their hold till my bro∣ther
struck one of them over the head
with his cane. But this flutter was fully
recompensed by the pleasures of Vaux∣hall;
which I no sooner entered, than I
was dazzled and confounded with the va∣riety
of beauties that rushed all at once
upon my eye. Image to yourself, my
dear Letty, a spacious garden, part laid
<PB N="196" REF="209"/>
out in delightful walks, bounded with
high hedges and trees, and paved with
gravel; part exhibiting a wonderful as∣semblage
of the most picturesque and
striking objects, pavilions, lodges, groves,
grottoes, lawns, temples, and cascades;
porticoes, colonades, and rotundos; a∣dorned
with pillars, statues, and paint∣ing:
the whole illuminated with an infi∣nate
number of lamps, disposed in diffe∣rent
figures of suns, stars, and constella∣tions;
the place crowded with the gayest
company, ranging through those bliss∣ful
shades, or supping in different lodges
on cold collations, enlivened with mirth,
freedom, and good-humour, and animat∣ed
by an excellent band of musick. A∣mong
the vocal performers I had the
happiness to hear the celebrated Mrs.
—, whose voice was so loud and so
shrill, that it made my head ake through
excess of pleasure.</P>
<P>In about half an hour after we arriv∣ed
we were joined by my uncle, who
did not seem to relish the place. Peo∣ple
of experience and infirmity, my dear
Letty, see with very different eyes from
those that such as you and I make use
of—Our evening's entertainment was in∣terrupted
by an unlucky accident. In
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
one of the remotest walks we were sur∣prised
with a sudden shower, that set the
whole company a-running, and drove us
in heaps, one upon another, into the ro∣tunda;
where my uncle, finding himself
wet, began to be very peevish and ur∣gent
to be gone. My brother went to
look for the coach, and found it with
much difficulty; but as it could not hold
us all, Mr. Barton stayed behind. It was
some time before the carriage could be
brought up to the gate, in the confusi∣on,
notwithstanding the utmost endea∣vours
of our new footman, Humphry
Clinker, who lost his scratch periwig,
and got a broken head in the scuffle.
The moment we were seated, my aunt
pulled off my uncle's shoes, and carefully
wrapped his poor feet in her capuchin;
then she gave him a mouth-full of cor∣dial,
which she always keeps in her
pocket, and his clothes were shifted as
soon as we arrived at lodgings; so that,
blessed be God, he escaped a severe cold,
of which he was in great terror.</P>
<P>As for Mr. Barton, I must tell you in
confidence, he was a little particular;
but, perhaps, I mistake his complaisance;
and I wish I may, for his sake—You know
the condition of my poor heart; which,
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
in spite of hard usage—And yet I ought
not to complain: nor will I, till farther
information.</P>
<P>Besides Ranelagh and Vauxhall, I have
been at Mrs. Cornelys' assembly, which,
for the rooms, the company, the dresses,
and decorations, surpasses all description;
but as I have no great turn for card-play∣ing,
I have not yet entered thoroughly
into the spirit of the place: indeed I am
still such a country hoyden, that I could
hardly find patience to be put in a con∣dition
to appear, yet I was not above six
hours under the hands of the hair-dresser,
who stuffed my head with as much black
wool as would have made a quilted pet∣ticoat;
and, after all, it was the smallest
head in the assembly, except my aunt's—
She, to be sure, was so particular with
her rumpt gown and petticoat, her scan∣ty
curls, her lappet-head, deep triple
ruffles, and high stays, that every body
looked at her with surprise: some whisper∣ed,
and some tittered; and lady Griskin,
by whom we were introduced, flatly told
her, she was twenty good years behind the
fashion.</P>
<P>Lady Griskin is a person of fashion, to
whom we have the honour to be related.
She keeps a small rout at her own house,
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
never exceeding ten or a dozen card-ta∣bles,
but these are frequented by the
best company in town—She has been so
obliging as to introduce my aunt and me
to some of her particular friends of qua∣lity,
who treat us with the most familiar
good-humour: we have once dined with
her, and she takes the trouble to direct
us in all our motions. I am so happy as
to have gained her good-will to such a
degree, that she sometimes adjusts my
cap with her own hands; and she has
given me a kind invitation to stay with
her all the winter. This, however, has
been cruelly declined by my uncle, who
seems to be (I know not how) prejudiced
against the good lady; for, whenever my
aunt happens to speak in her commenda∣tion,
I observe that he makes wry faces,
though he says nothing.—Perhaps, in∣deed,
these grimaces may be the effect of
pain arising from the gout and rheuma∣tism,
with which he is sadly distressed—
To me, however, he is always good-na∣tured
and generous, even beyond my
wish. Since we came hither, he has made
me a present of a suit of clothes, with
trimmings and laces, which cost more
money than I shall mention; and Jery,
at his desire, has given me my mother's
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
diamond drops, which are ordered to be
set a-new; so that it won't be his fault if
I do not glitter among the stars of the
fourth or fifth magnitude. I wish my
weak head may not grow giddy in the
midst of all this gallantry and dissipation;
though, as yet, I can safely declare, I
could gladly give up all these tumultu∣ous
pleasures, for country solitude, and a
happy retreat with those we love; among
whom, my dear Willis will always pos∣sess
the first place in the breast of her</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR PHILLIPS,</OPENER>
<P>I SEND you this letter, franked by our
old friend Barton; who is as much al∣tered
as it was possible for a man of his
kidney to be—Instead of the careless, in∣dolent
<PB N="201" REF="214"/>
sloven we knew at Oxford, I found
him a busy talkative politician; a petit∣maître
in his dress, and a ceremonious
courtier in his manners. He has not gall
enough in his constitution to be enflamed
with the rancour of party, so as to deal
in scurrilous invectives; but, since he
obtained a place, he is become a warm
partizan of the ministry, and sees every
thing through such an exaggerating me∣dium,
as to me, who am happily of no
party, is altogether incomprehensible—
Without all doubt, the fumes of faction
not only disturb the faculty of reason, but
also pervert the organs of sense; and I
would lay a hundred guineas to ten, that
if Barton on one side, and the most con∣scientious
patriot in the opposition on the
other, were to draw, upon honour, the
picture of the k—or m—, you and
I, who are still uninfected, and unbiassed,
would find both painters equally distant
from the truth. One thing, however,
must be allowed for the honour of Bar∣ton,
he never breaks out into illiberal
abuse, far less endeavours, by infamous
calumnies, to blast the moral character of
any individual on the other side.</P>
<P>Ever since we came hither, he has been
remarkably assiduous in his attention to
<PB N="202" REF="215"/>
our family; an attention, which, in a man
of his indolence and avocations, I should
have thought altogether odd, and even
unnatural, had not I perceived that my
sister Liddy has made some impression
upon his heart. I can't say that I have
any objection to his trying his fortune in
this pursuit: if an opulent estate and a
great stock of good-nature are sufficient
qualifications in a husband, to render the
marriage-state happy for life, she may be
happy with Barton; but, I imagine, there
is something else required to engage and
secure the affection of a woman of sense
and delicacy: something which nature
has denied our friend—Liddy seems to be
of the same opinion. When he addresses
himself to her in discourse, she seems to
listen with reluctance, and industriously
avoids all particular communication; but
in proportion to her coyness, our aunt is
coming. Mrs. Tabitha goes more than
half way to meet his advances; she mis∣takes,
or affects to mistake, the meaning
of his courtesy, which is rather formal
and fulsome; she returns his compli∣ments
with hyperbolical interest, she per∣secutes
him with her civilities at table,
she appeals to him for ever in conversa∣tion,
she sighs, and flirts, and ogles,
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
and by her hideous affectation and imper∣tinence,
drives the poor courtier to the
very extremity of his complaisance: in
short, she seems to have undertaken the
siege of Barton's heart, and carries on her
approaches in such a desperate manner,
that I don't know whether he will not be
obliged to capitulate. In the mean time,
his aversion to this inamorata struggling
with his acquired affability, and his na∣tural
fear of giving offence, throws him
into a kind of distress which is extreme∣ly
ridiculous.</P>
<P>Two days ago, he persuaded my un∣cle
and me to accompany him to St.
James's, where he undertook to make us
acquainted with the persons of all the
great men in the kingdom; and, indeed,
there was a great assemblage of distin∣guished
characters, for it was a high fes∣tival
at court. Our conductor performed
his promise with great punctuality. He
pointed out almost every individual of
both sexes, and generally introduced
them to our notice, with a flourish of pa∣negyrick—Seeing
the king approach,
“There comes (said he) the most ami∣able
sovereign that ever swayed the
sceptre of England; the <HI>deliciae hu∣mani
generis;</HI> Augustus, in patronizing
<PB N="204" REF="217"/>
merit; Titus Vespasian in generosity;
Trajan in beneficence; and Marcus
Aurelius, in philosophy.” “A very
honest kind-hearted gentleman (added
my uncle); he's too good for the
times. A king of England should have
a spice of the devil in his composition.”
Barton, then turning to the duke of C—,
proceeded,—“You know the duke; that
illustrious hero, who trod rebellion un∣der
his feet, and secured us in posses∣sion
of every thing we ought to hold
dear, as Englishmen and Christians.
Mark what an eye, how penetrating,
yet pacific! what dignity in his mein!
what humanity in his aspect—Even
malice must own, that he is one of the
greatest officers in Christendom.” “I
think he be (said Mr. Bramble); but
who are these young gentlemen that
stand beside him?” “Those! (cried
our friend) those are his royal nephews;
the princes of the blood. Sweet young
princes! the sacred pledges of the
Protestant line; so spirited, so sensi∣ble,
so princely—” “Yes; very sen∣sible!
very spirited! (said my uncle,
interrupting him) but see the queen!
ha, there's the queen!—There's the
queen! let me see—Let me see—
<PB N="205" REF="218"/>
Where are my glasses? ha! there's
meaning in that eye—There's senti∣ment—
There's expression—Well, Mr.
Barton, what figure do you call next?”
The next person he pointed out, was the
favourite <HI>yearl;</HI> who stood solitary by one
of the windows—“Behold yon northern
star, (said he) <HI>shorn of his beams</HI>—”
“What! the Caledonian luminary, that
lately blazed so bright in our hemis∣phere!
methinks, at present, it glim∣mers
through a fog; like Saturn with∣out
his ring, bleak, and dim, and
distant—Ha, there's the other great
phoenomenon, the grand pensionary,
that weather-cock of patriotism that
veers about in every point of the poli∣tical
compass, and still feels the wind
of popularity in his tail. He too, like
a portentous comet, has risen again a∣bove
the court-horizon; but how long
he will continue to ascend, it is not
easy to foretel, considering his great
eccentricity—Who are those two satel∣lites
that attend his motions?” When
Barton told him their names, “To their
characters (said Mr. Bramble) I am no
stranger. One of them, without a drop
of red blood in his veins, has a cold
intoxicating vapour in his head; and
<PB N="206" REF="219"/>
rancour enough in his heart to inocu∣late
and affect a whole nation. The
other is (I hear) intended for a share in
the ad—n, and the pensionary
vouches for his being duly qualified—
The only instance I ever heard of his
sagacity, was his deserting his former
patron, when he found him declining
in power, and in disgrace with the
people. Without principle, talent, or
intelligence, he is ungracious as a
hog, greedy as a vulture, and thievish
as a jackdaw; but, it must be owned,
he is no hypocrite. He pretends to no
virtue, and takes no pains to disguise
his character—His ministry will be at∣tended
with one advantage, no man
will be disappointed by his breach of
promise, as no mortal ever trusted to
his word. I wonder how lord—
first discovered this happy genius, and
for what purpose lord—has now
adopted him: but one would think,
that as amber has a power to attract
dirt, and straws, and chaff, a minister
is endued with the same kind of facul∣ty,
to <HI>lick up every knave and blockhead
in his way</HI>—” His elogium was inter∣rupted
by the arrival of the old duke of
N—; who, squeezing into the circle
<PB N="207" REF="220"/>
with a busy face of importance, thrust
his head into every countenance, as if he
had been in search of somebody, to whom
he wanted to impart something of great
consequence—My uncle, who had been
formerly known to him, bowed as he
passed; and the duke, seeing himself sa∣luted
so respectfully by a well-dressed
person, was not slow in returning the
courtesy—He even came up, and, tak∣ing
him cordially by the hand, “My
dear friend, Mr. A—, (said he) I am
rejoiced to see you—How long have
you been come from abroad?—How
did you leave our good friends, the
Dutch? The king of Prussia don't
think of another war, ah?—He's a
great king! a great conqueror! a very
great conqueror! Your Alexanders
and Hannibals were nothing at all to
him, sir—Corporals! drummers!
dross! mere trash—Damned trash,
heh?—” His grace being by this time
out of breath, my uncle took the oppor∣tunity
to tell him he had not been out
of England, that his name was Bram∣ble,
and that he had the honour to sit
in the last parliament but one of the late
king, as representative for the borough
of Dymkymraig. “Odso! (cried the
<PB N="208" REF="221"/>
duke) I remember you perfectly well,
my dear Mr. Bramble—You was al∣ways
a good and loyal subject—a
staunch friend to administration—I
made your brother an Irish bishop—”
“Pardon me, my lord (said the 'squire)
I once had a brother, but he was a
captain in the army—” “Ha! (said
his grace) he was so—He was, indeed!
But who was the bishop then? Bishop
Blackberry—Sure it was bishop
Blackberry—Perhaps some relation of
yours—” “Very likely, my lord
(replied my uncle); the Blackberry is
the fruit of the Bramble—But, I be∣lieve,
the bishop is not a berry of our
bush—” “No more he is—No more
he is, ha, ha, ha! (exclaimed the duke)
there you gave me a scratch, good Mr.
Bramble, ha, ha, ha!—Well, I shall
be glad to see you at Lincoln's-inn∣fields—You
know the way—Times
are altered. Though I have lost the
power, I retain the inclination—Your
very humble servant, good Mr. Black∣berry—”
So saying, he shoved to
another corner of the room. “What a
fine old gentleman! (cried Mr. Bar∣ton)
what spirits! what a memory!—
He never forgets an old friend.” “He
<PB N="209" REF="222"/>
does me too much honour, (observed
our 'squire) to rank me among the
number—Whilst I sat in parliament, I
never voted with the ministry but three
times, when my conscience told me
they were in the right: however, if he
still keeps levee, I will carry my
nephew thither, that he may see, and
learn to avoid the scene; for, I think,
an English gentleman never appears to
such disadvantage, as at the levee of
a minister—Of his grace I shall say no∣thing
at present, but that for thirty
years he was the constant and common
butt of ridicule and execration. He
was generally laughed at as an ape in
politics, whose office and influence
served only to render his folly the more
notorious; and the opposition cursed
him, as the indefatigable drudge of a
first-mover, who was justly stiled and
stigmatized as the father of corruption:
but this ridiculous ape, this venal
drudge, no sooner lost the places he
was so ill qualified to fill, and unfurl∣ed
the banners of faction, than he was
metamorphosed into a pattern of pub∣lic
virtue; the very people who revil∣ed
him before, now extolled him to
the skies, as a wise, experienced states∣man,
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
chief pillar of the Protestant suc∣cession,
and corner stone of English
liberty. I should be glad to know how
Mr. Barton reconciles these contradic∣tions,
without obliging us to resign all
title to the privilege of common sense.”
“My dear sir, (answered Barton) I don't
pretend to justify the extravagations of
the multitude; who, I suppose, were
as wild in their former censure, as in
their present praise: but I shall be very
glad to attend you on Thursday next
to his grace's levee; where, I'm afraid,
we shall not be crowded with com∣pany;
for, you know, there's a wide
difference between his present office of
president of the council, and his for∣mer
post of first lord commissioner of
the treasury.”</P>
<P>This communicative friend having an∣nounced
all the remarkable characters of
both sexes, that appeared at court, we
resolved to adjourn, and retired. At the
foot of the stair-case, there was a crowd of
laqueys and chairmen, and in the midst of
them stood Humphry Clinker, exalted
upon a stool, with his hat in one hand,
and a paper in the other, in the act of
holding forth to the people—Before we
could inquire into the meaning of this ex∣hibition,
<PB N="211" REF="224"/>
he perceived his master, thrust
the paper into his pocket, descended from
his elevation, bolted through the crowd,
and brought up the carriage to the
gate.</P>
<P>My uncle said nothing till we were
seated, when, after having looked at me ear∣nestly
for some time, he burst out a-laugh∣ing,
and asked if I knew upon what sub∣ject
Clinker was holding forth to the mob
—“If (said he) the fellow is turned
mountebank, I must turn him out of
my service, otherwise he'll make Mer∣ry
Andrews of us all—” I observed,
that, in all probability, he had studied
medicine under his master, who was a
farrier.—</P>
<P>At dinner, the 'squire asked him, if he
had ever practised physic? “Yes, an
please your honour, (said he) among
brute beasts; but I never meddle with
rational creatures.” “I know not
whether you rank in that class the au∣dience
you was harranguing in the
court at St. James's, but I should be
glad to know what kind of powders
you was distributing; and whether
you had a good sale—” “Sale, sir!
(cried Clinker) I hope I shall never be
base enough to sell for gold and silver,
<PB N="212" REF="225"/>
what freely comes of God's grace. I
distributed nothing, an like your ho∣nour,
but a word of advice to my fel∣lows
in servitude and sin.” “Ad∣vice!
concerning what?” “Concern∣ing
profane swearing, an please your
honour; so horrid and shocking, that
it made my hair stand on end.” “Nay,
if thou can'st cure them of that disease,
I shall think thee a wonderful doctor
indeed—” “Why not cure them,
my good master? the hearts of those
poor people are not so stubborn as your
honour seems to think—Make them
first sensible that you have nothing in
view but their good, then they will
listen with patience, and easily be con∣vinced
of the sin and folly of a practice
that affords neither profit not plea∣sure—”
At this remark, our uncle
changed colour, and looked round the
company, conscious that his <HI>own withers
were not altogether unwrung.</HI> “But, Clin∣ker,
(said he) if you should have elo∣quence
enough to persuade the vulgar,
to resign those tropes and figures of
rhetoric, there will be little or nothing
left to distinguish their conversation
from that of their betters.” “But
then your honour knows, their conver∣sation
<PB N="213" REF="226"/>
will be void of offence; and, at
the day of judgment, there will be no
distinction of persons.”</P>
<P>Humphry going down stairs to fetch
up a bottle of wine, my uncle congratu∣lated
his sister upon having such a refor∣mer
in the family; when Mrs. Tabitha
declared, he was a sober civilized fellow;
very respectful, and very industrious;
and, she believed, a good Christian into
the bargain. One would think, Clinker
must really have some very extraordinary
talent, to ingratiate himself in this man∣ner
with a virago of her character, so for∣tified
against him with prejudice and re∣sentment;
but the truth is, since the ad∣venture
of Salt-hill, Mrs. Tabby seems
to be entirely changed. She has left off
scolding the servants, an exercise which
was grown habitual, and even seemed ne∣cessary
to her constitution; and is be∣come
so indifferent to Chowder, as to
part with him in a present to lady Gris∣kin,
who proposes to bring the breed of
him into fashion. Her ladyship is the
widow of sir Timothy Griskin, a distant
relation of our family. She enjoys a join∣ture
of five hundred pounds a-year, and
makes shift to spend three times that sum.
Her character before marriage was a lit∣tle
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
equivocal; but at present she lives in
the <HI>bon ton,</HI> keeps card-tables, gives pri∣vate
suppers to select friends, and is visit∣ed
by persons of the first fashion—She
has been remarkably civil to us all, and
cultivates my uncle with the most parti∣cular
regard; but the more she strokes
him, the more his bristles seem to rise—
To her compliments he makes very la∣conic
and dry returns—T'other day, she
sent us a pottle of fine strawberries,
which he did not receive without signs of
disgust, muttering from the Aeneid, <HI>ti∣meo
Danaos et Dona f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rentes.</HI> She has twice
called for Liddy, of a forenoon, to take
an airing in the coach; but Mrs. Tabby
was always so alert, (I suppose by his di∣rection)
that she never could have the
niece without her aunt's company—I
have endeavoured to sound Square-toes on
this subject; but he carefully avoids all
explanation.</P>

<P>YES, Doctor, I have seen the British
Museum; which is a noble collection,
and even stupendous, if we consider it
was made by a private man, a physician,
who was obliged to make his own fortune
at the same time: but great as the collec∣tion
is, it would appear more striking if
it was arranged in one spacious saloon,
instead of being divided into different a∣partments,
which it does not entirely fill—
I could wish the series of medals was con∣nected,
and the whole of the animal, ve∣getable,
and mineral kingdoms complet∣ed,
by adding to each, at the public ex∣pence,
those articles that are wanting.
It would likewise be a great improve∣ment,
with respect to the library, if the
deficiencies were made up, by purchasing
all the books of character that are not to
be found already in the collection—They
might be classed in centuries, according
to the dates of their publication, and ca∣talogues
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
printed of them and the manu∣scripts,
for the information of those that
want to consult, or compile from such
authorities. I could also wish, for the
honour of the nation, that there was a
complete apparatus for a course of mathe∣matics,
mechanics, and experimental
philosophy; and a good salary settled up∣on
an able professor, who should give re∣gular
lectures on these subjects.</P>
<P>But this is all idle speculation, which
will never be reduced to practice—Con∣sidering
the temper of the times, it is a
wonder to see any institution whatsoever
established, for the benefit of the public.
The spirit of party is risen to a kind of
phrenzy, unknown to former ages, or
rather degenerated to a total extinction of
honesty and candour—You know I have
observed, for some time, that the public
papers are become the infamous vehicles
of the most cruel and perfidious defama∣tion:
every rancorous knave—every
desperate incendiary, that can afford to
spend half a crown or three shillings,
may skulk behind the press of a news∣monger,
and have a stab at the first cha∣racter
in the kingdom, without running
the least hazard of detection or punish∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="230"/>
I have made acquaintance with a Mr.
Barton, whom Jery knew at Oxford; a
good sort of a man, though most ridicu∣lously
warped in his political principles;
but his partiality is the less offensive, as it
never appears in the stile of scurrility and
abuse. He is a member of parliament,
and a retainer to the court; and his whole
conversation turns upon the virtues and
perfections of the ministers, who are his
patrons. T'other day, when he was be∣daubing
one of those worthies, with the
most fulsome praise, I told him I had
seen the same nobleman characterised ve∣ry
differently, in one of the daily-papers;
indeed, so stigmatized, that if one half
of what was said of him was true, he
must be not only unfit to rule, but even
unfit to live: that those impeachments
had been repeated again and again, with
the addition of fresh matter; and that as
he had taken no steps towards his own
vindication, I began to think there was
some foundation for the charge. “And
pray, sir, (said Mr. Barton) what steps
would you have him take?—Suppose
he should prosecute the publisher, who
screens the anonymous accuser, and
bring him to the pillory for a libel;
this is so far from being counted a
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
punishment, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> that it will
probably make his fortune. The mul∣titude
immediately take him into their
protection, as a martyr to the cause of
defamation, which they have always
espoused—They pay his fine, they
contribute to the increase of his stock,
his shop is crowded with customers,
and the sale of his paper rises in pro∣portion
to the scandal it contains. All
this time the prosecutor is inveighed
against as a tyrant and oppressor, for
having chosen to proceed by the way
of information, which is deemed a
grievance; but if he lays an action for
damages, he must prove the damage,
and I leave you to judge, whether a
gentleman's character may not be
brought into contempt, and all his
views in life blasted by calumny, with∣out
his being able to specify the par∣ticulars
of the damage he has sus∣tained.”</P>
<P>“This spirit of defamation is a kind
of heresy, that thrives under persecu∣tion.
<HI>The liberty of the press</HI> is a term
of great efficacy; and, like that of <HI>the
Protestant religion,</HI> has often served the
purposes of sedition—A minister, there∣fore,
must arm himself with patience,
<PB N="219" REF="232"/>
and bear those attacks without repin∣ing—Whatever
mischief they may do
in other respects, they certainly con∣tribute,
in one particular, to the ad∣vantage
of government; for those de∣famatory
articles have multiplied pa∣pers
in such a manner, and augment∣ed
their sale to such a degree, that the
duty upon stamps and advertisements
has made a very considerable addition
to the revenue.” Certain it is, a gen∣tleman's
honour is a very delicate subject
to be handled by a jury, composed of
men, who cannot be supposed remark∣able
either for sentiment or impartiality
—In such a case, indeed, the defendant
is tried, not only by his peers, but also
by his party; and I really think, that of all
patriots, he is the most resolute who ex∣poses
himself to such detraction, for the
sake of his country—If, from the igno∣rance
or partiality of juries, a gentleman
can have no redress from law, for being
defamed in a pamphlet or news-paper, I
know but one other method of proceed∣ing
against the publisher, which is at∣tended
with some risque, but has been
practised successfully, more than once, in
my remembrance—A regiment of horse
was represented, in one of the news-pa∣pers,
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
as having misbehaved at Dettin∣gen;
a captain of that regiment broke
the publisher's bones, telling him, at the
same time, if he went to law, he should
certainly have the like salutation from
every officer of the corps. Governor
—took the same satisfaction on the
ribs of an author, who traduced him by
name in a periodical paper—I know a
low fellow of the same class, who, being
turned out of Venice for his impudence
and scurrility, retired to Lugano, a town
of the Grisons, (a free people, God wot)
where he found a printing press, from
whence he squirted his filth at some re∣spectable
characters in the republic, which
he had been obliged to abandon. Some
of these, finding him out of the reach of
legal chastisement, employed certain use∣ful
instruments, such as may be found in
all countries, to give him the bastinado;
which, being repeated more than once,
effectually stopt the current of his abuse.</P>
<P>As for the liberty of the press, like
every other privilege, it must be restrain∣ed
within certain bounds; for if it is
carried to a breach of law, religion, and
charity, it becomes one of the greatest
evils that ever annoyed the community.
If the lowest ruffian may stab your good-name
<PB N="221" REF="234"/>
with impunity in England, will
you be so uncandid as to exclaim against
Italy for the practice of common assas∣sination?
To what purpose is our proper∣ty
secured, if our moral character is le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
desenceless? People thus baited, grow
desperate; and the despair of being able
to preserve one's character, untainted by
such vermin, produces a total neglect of
fame; so that one of the chief incite∣ments
to the practice of virtue is effec∣tually
destroyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Barton's last consideration, respect∣ing
the stamp-duty, is equally wise and
laudable with another maxim which has
been long adopted by our financiers,
namely, to connive at drunkenness, riot,
and dissipation, because they inhance the
receipt of the excise; not reflecting, that
in providing this temporary convenience,
they are destroying the morals, health,
and industry of the people—Notwith∣standing
my contempt for those who flat∣ter
a minister, I think there is something
still more de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icable in slattering a mob.
When I see a man of birth, education,
and fortune, put himself on a level with
the dregs of the people, mingle with low
mechanics, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with them at the same
board, and drink with them in the same
<PB N="222" REF="235"/>
cup, flatter their prejudices, harangue
in praise of their virtues, expose them∣selves
to the belchings of their beer, the
fumes of their tobacco, the grossness of
their familiarity, and the impertinence of
their conversation, I cannot help despis∣ing
him▪ as a man guilty of the vilest
prostitution, in order to effect a purpose
equally selfish and illiberal.</P>
<P>I should renounce politics the more
willingly, if I could find other topics of
conversation discussed with more modesty
and candour; but the daemon of party
seems to have usurped every department
of life. Even the world of literature and
taste is divided into the most virulent
factions, which revile, decry, and tra∣duce
the works of one another. Yester∣day,
I went to return an afternoon's visit
to a gentleman of my acquaintance, at
whose house I found one of the authors
of the present age, who has written with
some success—As I had read one or two
of his performances, which gave me plea∣sure,
I was glad of this opportunity to
know his person; but his discourse and
deportment destroyed all the impressions
which his writings had made in his fa∣vour.
He took upon him to decide dog∣matically
upon every subject, without
<PB N="223" REF="236"/>
deigning to shew the least cause for his
differing from the general opinions of
mankind, as if it had been our duty to
acquiese in the <HI>ipse dixit</HI> of this new Py∣thagoras.
He rejudged the characters of
all the principal authors, who had died
within a century of the present time;
and, in this revision, paid no sort of re∣gard
to the reputation they had acquired
—Milton was harsh and prosaic; Dry∣den,
languid and verbose; Butler and
Swift, without humour; Congreve, with∣out
wit; and Pope destitute of any sort
of poetical merit—As for his cotempora∣ries,
he could not bear to hear one of
them mentioned with any degree of ap∣plause—They
were all dunces, pedants,
plagiaries, quacks, and impostors; and
you could not name a single performance,
but what was tame, stupid, and insipid.
It must be owned, that this writer had
nothing to charge his conscience with, on
the side of flattery; for, I understand, he
was never known to praise one line that
was written, even by those with whom he
lived on terms of good-fellowship. This
arrogance and presumption, in depreciat∣ing
authors, for whose reputation the
company may be interested, is such an
<PB N="224" REF="237"/>
insult upon the understanding, as I could
not bear without wincing.</P>
<P>I desired to know his reasons for de∣crying
some works, which had afforded
me uncommon pleasure; and, as demon∣stration
did not seem to be his talent, I
dissented from his opinion with great free∣dom.
Having been spoiled by the defe∣rence
and humility of his hearers, he did
not bear contradiction with much tem∣per;
and the dispute might have grown
warm, had it not been interrupted by
the entrance of a rival bard, at whose ap∣pearance
he always quits the place—
They are of different cabals, and have been
at open war these twenty years—If the
other was dogmatical, this genius was de∣clamatory:
he did not discourse, but ha∣rangue;
and his orations were equally te∣dious
and turgid. He too pronounces <HI>ex
cathedra</HI> upon the characters of his co∣temporaries;
and though he scruples not
to deal out praise, even lavishly, to the
lowest reptile in Grub street who will
either flatter him in private, or mount
the public rostrum as his panegyrist, he
damns all the other writers of the age,
with the utmost insolence and rancour—
One is a blunderbuss, as being a native
of Ireland; another, a half-starved louse
<PB N="225" REF="238"/>
of literature, from the banks of the
Tweed; a third, an ass, because he en∣joys
a pension from the government; a
fourth, the very angel of dulness; be∣cause
he succeeded in a species of writ∣ing
in which this Aristarchus had fail∣ed;
a fifth, who presumed to make stric∣tures
upon one of his performances, he
holds as a bug in criticism, whose stench
is more offensive than his sting—In short,
except himself and his myrmidons, there
is not a man of genius or learning in the
three kingdoms. As for the success of
those, who have written without the pale
of this confederacy, he imputes it entire∣ly
to want of taste in the public; not
considering, that to the approbation of
that very tasteless public, he himself owes
all the consequence he has in life.</P>
<P>Those originals are not fit for conver∣sation.
If they would maintain the ad∣vantage
they have gained by their writ∣ing,
they should never appear but up∣on
paper—For my part, I am shocked
to find a man have sublime ideas in his
head, and nothing but illiberal senti∣ments
in his heart—The human soul will
be generally found most defective in the
article of candour—I am inclined to think,
no mind was ever wholly exempt from
<PB N="226" REF="239"/>
envy; which, perhaps, may have been
implanted, as an instinct essential to our
nature. I am afraid we sometimes pal∣liate
this vice, under the specious name
of emulation. I have known a person re∣markably
generous, humane, moderate,
and apparently self-denying, who could
not hear even a friend commended,
without betraying marks of uneasiness; as
if that commendation had implied an
odious comparison to his prejudice, and
every wreath of praise added to the
other's character, was a garland plucked
from his own temples. This is a ma∣lignant
species of jealousy, of which I
stand acquitted in my own conscience—
Whether it is a vice, or an infirmity, I
leave you to inquire.</P>
<P>There is another point, which I would
much rather see determined; whether
the world was always as contemptible, as
it appears to me at present?—If the mo∣rals
of mankind have not contracted an
extraordinary degree of depravity, with∣in
these thirty years, then must I be in∣fected
with the common vice of old men,
<HI>difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti;</HI>
or, which is more probable, the impetu∣ous
pursuits and avocations of youth have
formerly hindered me from observing
<PB N="227" REF="240"/>
those rotten parts of human nature, which
now appear so offensively to my obser∣vation.</P>
<P>We have been at court, and 'change,
and every where; and every where we
find food for spleen, and subject for ri∣dicule—My
new servant, Humphry Clin∣ker,
turns out a great original; and
Tabby is a changed creature—She has
parted with Chowder; and does nothing
but smile, like Malvolio in the play—
I'll be hanged if she is not acting a part
which is not natural to her disposition,
for some purpose which I have not yet
discovered.</P>
<P>With respect to the characters of man∣kind,
my curiosity is quite satisfied: I
have done with the science of men, and
must now endeavour to amuse myself with
the novelty of things. I am, at present,
by a violent effort of the mind, forced
from my natural biass; but this power
ceasing to act, I shall return to my soli∣tude

<P>O Molly! what shall I say of London?
All the towns that ever I beheld in my

and crumlecks to this wonderful
sitty! Even Bath itself is but a fillitch,
in the naam of God—One would think
there's no end of the streets, but the
land's end. Then there's such a power
of people, going hurry skurry! Such a
racket of coxes! Such a noise, and hali∣balloo!
So many strange sites to be seen!
O gracious! my poor Welsh brain has
been spinning like a top ever since I
came hither! And I have seen the Park,
and the paleass of Saint Gimses, and the
king's and the queen's magisterial pur∣sing,
and the sweet young princes, and
the hillyfents, and pye-bald ass, and all
the rest of the royal family.</P>
<P>Last week I went with mistress to the

and there was a monstracious lion, with
teeth half a quarter long; and a gentle∣man

tittered forsooth; but I'll go to death up∣on
it, I will, that my lady is as good a

either the gentleman told a fib, or
the lion oft to be set in the stocks for
bearing false witness again his neigh∣bour;
for the commandment sayeth,
<HI>Thou shalt not bear false witness again thy

<P>I was afterwards of a party at Sadler's-wells,
where I saw such tumbling and
dancing upon ropes and wires, that I was
frightened, and ready to go into a fit—
I tho't it was all inchantment; and, be∣lieving
myself bewitched, began for to
cry—You knows as how the witches in
Wales fly upon broom-sticks; but here
was flying without any broom-stick, or
thing in the varsal world, and firing of
pistols in the air, and blowing of trum∣pets,
and swinging, and rolling of wheel∣barrows
upon a wire, (God bless us!) no
thicker than a sewing-thread; that, to be
sure, they must deal with the devil!—
A fine gentleman, with a pig's-tail, and
a golden sord by his side, came to com∣fit
<PB N="231" REF="244"/>
me, and offered for to treat me with
a pint of wind; but I would not stay;
and so, in going through the dark pas∣sage,
he began to shew his cloven futt,
and went for to be rude: my fellow-sar∣vant,
Umpry Klinker, bid him be sivil,
and he gave the young man a dowse in
the chops; but, I fackins, Mr. Klinker
wa'n't long in his debt—with a good
oaken sapling he dusted his doublet,
for all his golden cheese-toaster; and,
fipping me under his arm, carried me

such a flustration—But, thank God! I'm
now vaned from all such vanities; for
what are all those rarities and vagaries to
the glory that shall be revealed hereafter?
O Molly! let not your poor heart be
puffed up with vanity.</P>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of
Jesus college, Oxon.
DEAR WAT,</OPENER>
<P>I MENTIONED in my last, my un∣cle's
design of going to the duke of
N—'s levee; which design has been
executed accordingly. His grace has
been so long accustomed to this kind of
homage, that though the place he now
fills does not imply the tenth part of the
influence, which he exerted in his former
office, he has given his friends to under∣stand,
that they cannot oblige him in any
thing more, than in contributing to sup∣port
the shadow of that power, which he
<PB N="234" REF="247"/>
no longer retains in substance; and there∣fore
he has still public days, on which
they appear at his levee.</P>
<P>My uncle and I went thither with Mr.
Barton, who, being one of the duke's
adherents, undertook to be our intro∣ducer—
The room was pretty well filled
with people, in a great variety of dress;
but there was no more than one gown
and cassock, though I was told his grace
had, while he was minister, preferred al∣most
every individual that now filled the
bench of bishops in the house of lords;
but, in all probability, the gratitude of
the clergy is like their charity, which
shuns the light—Mr. Barton was imme∣diately
accosted by a person, well stricken
in years, tall, and raw-boned, with a
hook-nose, and an arch leer, that indi∣cated,
at least, as much cunning as sa∣gacity.
Our conductor saluted him, by
the name of captain C—, and after∣wards
informed us he was a man of shrewd
parts, whom the government occasion∣ally
employed in secret services—But I
have had the history of him more at large,
from another quarter—He had been,
many years ago, concerned in fraudulent
practices, as a merchant, in France; and
being convicted of some of them, was sent
<PB N="235" REF="248"/>
to the gallies, from whence he was de∣livered
by the interest of the late duke of
Ormond, to whom he had recommended
himself in letter, as his name-sake and re∣lation—He
was in the sequel, employed
by our ministry as a spy; and in the war
of 1740, traversed all Spain, as well as
France, in the disguise of a capuchin, at
the extreme hazard of his life, in as much
as the court of Madrid had actually got
scent of him, and given orders to appre∣hend
him at St. Sebastian's, from whence
he had fortunately retired but a few
hours before the order arrived. This
and other hair-breadth 'scapes he pleaded
so effectually as a merit with the English
ministry, that they allowed him a com∣fortable
pension, which he now enjoys in
his old age—He has still access to all the
ministers, and is said to be consulted by
them on many subjects, as a man of un∣common
understanding and great expe∣rience—He
is, in fact, a fellow of some
parts, and invincible assurance; and, in
his discourse, he assumes such an air of
self-sufficiency, as may very well impose
upon some of the shallow politicians, who
now labour at the helm of administration.
But, if he is not belied, this is not the
only imposture of which he is guilty—
<PB N="236" REF="249"/>
They say, he is at bottom not only a
Roman-catholic, but really a priest; and
while he pretends to disclose to our state-pilots
all the springs that move the ca∣binet
of Versailles, he is actually picking
up intelligence for the service of the
French minister—Be that as it may,
captain C—entered into conversation
with us in the most familiar manner, and
treated the duke's character without any
ceremony—“This wise-acre (said he) is
still a-bed; and, I think, the best thing
he can do, is to sleep on till Christ∣mas;
for, when he gets up, he does
nothing but expose his own folly.—
Since Granville was turned out, there
has been no minister in this nation
worth the meal that whitened his peri∣wig—They
are so ignorant, they scarce
know a crab from a cauliflower; and
then they are such dunces, that there's
no making them comprehend the plain∣est
proposition—In the beginning of
the war, this poor half-witted creature
told me, in a great fright, that thirty
thousand French had marched from
Acadie to Cape Breton—Where did
they find transports?” (said I) “Tran∣sports!
(cried he) I tell you, they
marched by land—” By land to the
<PB N="237" REF="250"/>
island of Cape Breton? “What! is
Cape Breton an island?” Certainly.
“Ha! are you sure of that?” When I
pointed it out in the map, he examined
it earnestly with his spectacles; then,
taking me in his arms, “My dear
C—! (cried he) you always bring us
good news—Egad! I'll go directly, and
tell the king that Cape Breton is an
island—”</P>
<P>He seemed disposed to entertain us with
more anecdotes of this nature, at the ex∣pence
of his grace, when he was inter∣rupted
by the arrival of the Algerine am∣bassador;
a venerable Turk▪ with a long
white beard, attended by his dragoman,
or interpreter, and another officer of his
household, who had got no stockings to
his legs—Captain C—immediately
spoke with an air of authority to a ser∣vant
in waiting, bidding him go and tell
the duke to rise, as the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a great deal
of company come, and, among others,
the ambassador from Algiers▪ Then,
turning to us, “<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his poor Turk. (said
he) notwithstanding his grey beard, is
a green-horn—He has been several
years resident in London, and still is
ignorant of our political revolutions.
This visit is intended for the prime mi∣nister
<PB N="238" REF="251"/>
of England; but you'll see how
this wise duke will receive it as a mark
of attachment to his own person—”
Certain it is, the duke seemed eager to
acknowledge the compliment—A door
opening, he suddenly bolted out, with a
shaving-cloth under his chin, his face
frothed up to the eyes with soap lather;
and, running up to the ambassador, grin∣ned
hideous in his face—“My dear Ma∣homet!
(said he) God love your long
beard, I hope the dey will make you a
horse-tail at the next promotion, ha,
ha, ha!—Have but a moment's pa∣tience,
and I'll send to you in a twink∣ling—”
So saying, he retreated into
his den, leaving the Turk in some confu∣sion.
After a short pause, however, he
said something to his interpreter, the
meaning of which I had great curiosity
to know, as he turned up his eyes while
he spoke, expressing astonishment, mixed
with devotion—We were gratified by
means of the communicative captain
C—, who conversed with the drago∣man,
as an old acquaintance. Ibrahim,
the ambassador, who had mistaken his
grace for the minister's fool, was no
sooner undeceived by the interpreter, than
he exclaimed to this effect—“Holy
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
prophet! I don't wonder that this na∣tion
prospers, seeing it is governed by
the counsel of ideots; a series of men,
whom all good mussulmen revere as the
organs of immediate inspiration!”
Ibrahim was favoured with a particular
audience of short duration; after which
the duke conducted him to the door, and
then returned to diffuse his gracious looks
among the crowd of his worshippers.</P>
<P>As Mr. Barton advanced to present me
to his grace, it was my fortune to attract
his notice, before I was announced—He
forthwith met me more than half way,
and, seizing me by the hand, “My dear
sir Francis! (cried he) this is so kind—
I vow to Gad! I am so obliged—Such
attention to a poor broken minister—
Well—Pray when does your excellency
set sail?—For God's sake have a care
of your health, and eat stewed prunes
in the passage—Next to your own pre∣cious
health, pray, my dear excellency,
take care of the Five Nations—Our good
friends the Five Nations—The Toryro∣ries,
the Maccolmacks, the Out-o'the-ways,
the Crickets, and the Kickshaws
—Let 'em have plenty of blankets, and
stinkubus, and wampum; and your
excellency won't fail to scour the ket∣tle,
<PB N="240" REF="253"/>
and boil the chain, and bury the
tree, and plant the hatchet—Ha, ha,
ha!” When he had uttered this rhap∣sody,
with his usual precipitation, Mr.
Barton gave him to understand, that I
was neither Sir Francis, nor St. Francis,
but simply Mr. Melford, nephew to Mr.
Bramble; who, stepping forward, made
his bow at the same time. “Odso! no
more it is Sir Francis—(said this wise
statesman) Mr. Melford, I'm glad to
see you—I sent you an engineer to for∣tify
your dock—Mr. Bramble—your
servant, Mr. Bramble—How d'ye, good
Mr. Bramble? Your nephew is a pretty
young fellow—Faith and troth, a very
pretty fellow!—His father is my old
friend—How does he hold it? Still
troubled with that damned disorder,
ha?” “No, my lord, (replied my un∣cle)
all his troubles are over—He has
been dead these fifteen years.” “Dead!
how—Yes, faith! now I remember:
he is dead, sure enough—Well, and
how—does the young gentleman stand
for Haverford West? or—a—what
d'ye—My dear Mr. Milfordhaven, I'll
do you all the service in my power—I
hope I have some credit left—” My
uncle then gave him to understand, that
<PB N="241" REF="254"/>
I was still a minor; and that we had no
intention to trouble him at present, for
any favour whatsoever—“I came hither
with my nephew (added he) to pay our
respects to your grace; and I may ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ture
to say, that his views and mine
are at least as disinterested as those
of any individual in this assembly.”
“My dear Mr. Brambleberry! you do
me infinite honour—I shall always re∣joice
to see you and your hopeful
nephew, Mr. Milfordhaven—My cre∣dit,
such as it is, you may command—
I wish we had more friends of your
kidney—”</P>
<P>Then, turning to captain C—, “Ha,
C—! (said he) what news, C—?
How does the world wag? ha!” “The
world wags much after the old fashion,
my lord (answered the captain): the
politicians of London and Westminster
have begun again to wag their tongues
against your grace; and your short∣lived
popularity wags like a feather,
which the next puff of antiministerial
calumny will blow away—” “A pack
of rascals (cried the duke)—Tories,
Jacobites, rebels; one half of them
would wag their heels at Tyburn, if
<PB N="242" REF="255"/>
they had their deserts—” So saying,
he wheeled about; and, going round the
levee, spoke to every individual, with the
most courteous familiarity; but he scarce
ever opened his mouth without making
some blunder, in relation to the person
or business of the party with whom he
conversed; so that he really looked like
a comedian, hired to burlesque the cha∣racter
of a minister—At length, a person
of a very prepossessing appearance com∣ing
in, his grace ran up, and, hugging
him in his arms, with the appellation of
“My dear Ch—s!” led him forthwith
into the inner apartment, or <HI>Sanctum
Sactorum</HI> of this political temple. “That
(said captain C—) is my friend C—
T—, almost the only man of parts
who has any concern in the present ad∣ministration—Indeed,
he would have
no concern at all in the matter, if the
ministry did not find it absolutely ne∣cessary
to make use of his talents upon
some particular occasions—As for the
common business of the nation, it is
carried on in a constant routine by the
clerks of the different offices, other∣wise
the wheels of government would
be wholly stopt amidst the abrupt suc∣cession
<PB N="243" REF="256"/>
of ministers, every one more ig∣norant
than his predecessor—I am
thinking what a fine hovel we should
be in, if all the clerks of the treasury,
of the secretaries, the war-office, and
the admiralty, should take it in their
heads to throw up their places in imi∣tation
of the great pensioner—But, to
return to C—T—; he certainly
knows more than all the ministry and
all the opposition, if their heads were
laid together, and talks like an angel
on a vast variety of subjects—He would
really be a great man, if he had any
consistency or stability of character—
Then, it must be owned, he wants
courage, otherwise he would never al∣low
himself to be cowed by the great
political bully, for whose understand∣ing
he has justly a very great con∣tempt.
I have seen him as much afraid
of that overbearing Hector, as ever
school-boy was of his pedagogue; and
yet this Hector, I shrewdly suspect, is
no more than a craven at bottom—Be∣sides
this defect, C—has another,
which he is at too little pains to hide
—There's no faith to be given to his
assertions, and no trust to be put in his
<PB N="244" REF="257"/>
promises—However, to give the devil
his due, he's very good-natured; and
even friendly, when close urged in the
way of solicitation—As for principle,
that's out of the question—In a word,
he is a wit and an orator, extremely
entertaining, and he shines very often
at the expence even of those ministers
to whom he is a retainer—This is a
mark of great imprudence, by which
he has made them all his enemies,
whatever face they may put upon the
matter; and sooner or later he'll have
cause to wish he had been able to keep
his own counsel—I have several times
cautioned him on this subject; but 'tis
all preaching to the desert—His vanity
runs away with his discretion—” I
could not help thinking the captain him∣self
might have been the better for some
hints of the same nature—His panegyric,
excluding principle and veracity, puts me
in mind of a contest I once over-heard, in
the way of altercation, betwixt two ap∣ple-women
in Spring-garden—One of
those viragos having hinted something to
the prejudice of the other's moral cha∣racter,
her antagonist, setting her hands
in her sides, replied—“Speak out, hussy
<PB N="245" REF="258"/>
—I scorn your malice—I own I'm both
a whore and a thief; and what more
have you to say?—Damn you, what
more have you to say? bating that,
which all the world knows, I challenge
you to say black is the white of my
eye—” We did not wait for Mr. T—'s
coming forth; but after captain C—
had characterised all the originals in wait∣ing,
we adjourned to a coffee-house,
where we had buttered muffins and tea
to breakfast, the said captain still favour∣ing
us with his company—Nay, my un∣cle
was so diverted with his anecdotes,
that he asked him to dinner, and treated
him with a fine turbot, to which he did
ample justice—That same evening I spent
at the tavern with some friends, one of
whom let me into C—'s character, which
Mr. Bramble no sooner understood, than
he expressed some concern for the con∣nexion
he had made, and resolved to dis∣engage
himself from it without cere∣mony.</P>
<P>We are become members of the Socie∣ty
for the Encouragement of the Arts, and
have assisted at some of their delibera∣tions,
which were conducted with equal
spirit and sagacity—My uncle is extreme∣ly
<PB N="246" REF="259"/>
fond of the institution, which will
certainly be productive of great advant∣ages
to the public, if, from its democra∣tical
form, it does not degenerate into ca∣bal
and corruption—You are already ac∣quainted
with his aversion to the influence
of the multitude, which, he affirms, is
incompatible with excellence, and sub∣versive
of order—Indeed his detestation
of the mob has been heightened by fear,
ever since he fainted in the room at Bath;
and this apprehension has prevented him
from going to the Little Theatre in the
Hay-market, and other places of enter∣tainment,
to which, however, I have had
the honour to attend the ladies.</P>
<P>It grates old Square-Toes to reflect,
that it is not in his power to enjoy even
the most elegant diversions of the capital,
without the participation of the vulgar;
for they now thrust themselves into all
assemblies, from a ridotto at St. James's,
to a hop at Rotherhithe.</P>
<P>I have lately seen our old acquaintance
Dick Ivy, who we imagined had died of
dram-drinking; but he is lately emerg∣ed
from the Fleet, by means of a pamph∣let
which he wrote and published against
the government with some success. The
<PB N="247" REF="260"/>
sale of this performance enabled him to
appear in clean linen, and he is now go∣ing
about soliciting subscriptions for his
Poems; but his breeches are not yet in
the most decent order.</P>
<P>Dick certainly deserves some counte∣nance
for his intrepidity and perseve∣rance—It
is not in the power of disap∣pointment,
nor even of damnation, to drive
him to despair—After some unsuccessful
essays in the way of poetry, he com∣menced
brandy-merchant, and I believe
his whole stock ran out through his own
bowels; then he consorted with a milk-woman,
who kept a cellar in Petty
France: but he could not make his
quarters good; he was dislodged and
driven up stairs into the kennel by a cor∣poral
in the second regiment of foot-guards—He
was afterwards the laureat of
Blackfriars▪ from whence there was a na∣tural
transition to the Fleet—As he had
formerly miscarried in panegyric, he now
turned his thoughts to satire, and really
seems to have some talent for abuse. If
he can hold out till the meeting of the
parliament, and be prepared for another
charge, in all probability Dick will
<PB N="248" REF="261"/>
mount the pillory, or obtain a pension,
in either of which events his fortune will
be made—Mean while he has acquired
some degree of consideration with the re∣spectable
writers of the age; and as I
have subscribed for his works, he did me
the favour 'tother night to introduce me
to a society of those geniuses; but I found
them exceedingly formal and reserved—
They seemed afraid and jealous of one
another, and sat in a state of mutual re∣pulsion,
like so many particles of vapour,
each surrounded by its own electrified at∣mosphere.
Dick, who has more vivacity
than judgment, tried more than once to
enliven the conversation; sometimes mak∣ing
an effort at wit, sometimes letting off a
pun, and sometimes discharging a conun∣drum;
nay, at length he started a dis∣pute
upon the hackneyed comparison
betwixt blank verse and rhyme, and the
professors opened with great clamour;
but, instead of keeping to the subject,
they launched out into tedious disserta∣tions
on the poetry of the antients; and
one of them, who had been a school∣master,
displayed his whole knowledge
of prosody, gleaned from Disputer and
<PB N="249" REF="262"/>
Ruddiman. At last, I ventured to say,
I did not see how the subject in question
could be at all elucidated by the practice
of the antients, who certainly had neither
blank verse nor rhyme in their poems,
which were measured by feet, whereas
ours are reckoned by the number of
syllables—This remark seemed to give
umbrage to the pedant, who forthwith
involved himself in a cloud of Greek
and Latin quotations, which nobody at∣tempted
to dispel—A confused hum of
insipid observations and comments en∣sued;
and, upon the whole, I never pass∣ed
a duller evening in my life—Yet, with∣out
all doubt, some of them were men of
learning, wit, and ingenuity. As they
are afraid of making free with one an∣other,
they should bring each his butt,
or whet-stone, along with him, for the
entertainment of the company—My un∣cle
says, he never desires to meet with
more than one wit at a time—One wit,
like a knuckle of ham in soup, gives a
zest and flavour to the dish; but more than
one serves only to spoil the pottage—
And now I'm afraid I have given you an
unconscionable mess, without any flavour
<PB N="250" REF="263"/>
at all; for which, I suppose, you will be∣stow
your benedictions upon</P>
