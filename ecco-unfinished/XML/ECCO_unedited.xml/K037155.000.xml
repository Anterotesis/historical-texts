<P>IS all our company here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here is the scrowl of every man's name, which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the Duke and Dutchess, on his wedding day at night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow on to a point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, our play is the most lamentable
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scrowl. Masters, spread your∣selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ready: Name what part I am for, and pro∣ceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Py∣ramus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What is Pyramus, a lover, or a tyrant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A lover that kills himself most gallantly for love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That will ask some tears in the true perform∣ing of it: If I do it let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest; yet, my chief humour is for a tyrant; I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in. <Q>“To make all split the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison-gates, and Phibbus carr shall shine ”from far, and make and mar the foolish fates!</Q> This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Flu.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What is Thisby, a, wand'ring knight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Lady that Pyramus must love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Flu.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, faith, let not me play a woman, I have a beard coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's all one, you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak small as you will.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too; I'll speak in a monstrous little voice; Thisne, Thisne, ah Pyramus my lover dear, thy Thisby dear, and lady dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you must play Pyramus; and Flute, you Thisby.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Star.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Peter Quince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother:</P>
<P>Tom Snowt, the tinker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snowt.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Peter Quince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You, Pyramus's father; myself, Thisby's father; Snug the joiner, you the Lion's part; I hope there is a play fitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snug.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have you the Lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me play the Lion too, I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, let him roar again, let him roar again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Dutchess and the Ladies, that they would shriek, and that were enough to hang us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>All.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That would hang us every mother's son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you, friends, if you should fright the Ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any night∣ingale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet fac'd man, a proper man as one
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentle∣man-like man: thererefore you must needs play Pyramus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why what you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour'd beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour'd beard, your perfect yellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some of your French-crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But, masters here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and desire you to con them by to-mor∣row night; and meet me in the palace-wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight, there we will rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dog'd with company, and our devices known. In the mean time I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We will meet, and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfect, adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At the Duke's oak we meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But hold ye, hold ye, neighbours; are your voices in order, and your tunes ready? For if we miss our musical pitch, we shall be all 'sham'd and abandon'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay! Nothing goes down so well as a little of your sol, fa, and long quaver; therefore let us be in our airs — and for better assurance I have got the pitch pipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Stand round, stand round! We'll rehearse our eplog — Clear up your pipes, and every man in his turn take up his stanza-verse — Are you all ready?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What say'st thou, Bully Bottom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There are things in this Comedy of Pyramus and Thisby, that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the Ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snout.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By'rlaken, a parlous fear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Starv.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not a whit; I have a device to make all well; write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed; and for more better assurance tell them, that I Pyramus am not Pyra∣mus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snout.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will not the Ladies be afraid of the Lion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Starv.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I fear it, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Masters, you ought to consider with your∣selves; to bring in, heaven shield us! a Lion among Ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your Lion, living; and we ought to look to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snout.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a Lion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: Ladies, or fair Ladies, I would wish you, or I would request you, or I would intreat you, not to fear, not to tremble; my life for yours; if you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life; no, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly, He is Snug the Joiner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard things, that is, to bring the moon-light into a cham∣ber; for you know Pyramus and Thisby met by moon-light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snug.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A kalendar, a kalendar! look into the alma∣nack; find out moon-shine, find out moon-shine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it doth shine that night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon may shine in at the casement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of throns and a lanthern; and say he comes to dis∣figure or to present the person of moon-shine. Then there is another thing; we must have a wall in the great chamber, for Pyramus and Thisby (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Snug.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some man or other must present wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loome, or some rough-cast, about him, to signify wall: Or let him hold his fingers thus, and through the cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down every mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin; and when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake, and so every one according to his cue.</P>
