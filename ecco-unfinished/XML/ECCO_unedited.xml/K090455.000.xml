<P>Introduction. Recommendation of mercifulness to animals. Of the winding of wool. Diversity of wool in the fleece: skill in the assorting of it; particularly among the Dutch. The uses of each sort. Severe winters pernicious to the fleece. Directions to prevent their effects. Wool lightest in common-fields: inconvenien∣cies of common fields. Vulgar errors concerning the wool of Eng∣land: its real excellencies; and directions in the choice. No good wool in cold or wet pastures: yet all pastures improveable; exempli∣fied in the drainage of Bedford level. Britain in antient times not esteemed for wool. Countries esteemed for wool before the Argonautic expedition. Of that expedition, and its consequences. Countries af∣terwards esteemed for wool. The decay of arts and sciences in the barbarous ages: the revival, first at Venice. Countries noted for wool in the present times. Wool the best of all the various materials for clothing. The wool of our island, peculiarly excellent, is the combing wool. Methods to prevent its exportation. Apology of the author for treating this subject. Bishop Blaise, the inventor of wool∣combing. Of the dying of wool. Few dyes the natural product of England. Necessity of trade for importing them.
