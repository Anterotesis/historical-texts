<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SPeak, <HI>Satyr;</HI> for there's none can tell like thee,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery,</L>
<L>That makes this discontented Land appear</L>
<L>Less happy now in Times of Peace, than War:</L>
<L>Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more</L>
<L>Than all our Bloody Wars have done before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fools out of Favour grudge at Knaves in Place,</L>
<L>And men are always honest in Disgrace:</L>
<L>The Court-Preferments make men Knaves in course:</L>
<L>But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be worse.</L>
<L>'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou`d Foreigners their Perquisities resign:</L>
<L>The Grand Contention's plainly to be seen,</L>
<L>To get some men put out, and some put in.</L>
<L>For this our S—rs make long Harangues,</L>
<L>And florid M—rs whet their polish'd Tongues.</L>
<L>Statesmen are always sick of one Disease;</L>
<L>And a good Pension gives them present Ease.</L>
<L>That's the Specifick makes them all content</L>
<L>With any King, and any Government.</L>
<L>Good Patriots at Court-Abuses rail,</L>
<L>And all the Nation's Grievances bewail:</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Sov'reign Balsam</HI>'s once apply'd,</L>
<L>The Zealot never fails to change his▪ Side.</L>
<L>And when he must the <HI>Golden Key</HI> resign,</L>
<L>The <HI>Railing Spirit</HI> comes about again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse,</L>
<L>While they their own Felicities refuse?</L>
<L>Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother,</L>
<L>And now are falling out with one another:</L>
<L>With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill,</L>
<L>And always have been sav'd against their Will:</L>
<L>Who Fifty Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> have disburs'd,</L>
<L>To be with Peace and too much Plenty curs'd.</L>
<L>Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo,</L>
<L>And yet uneasily obey the New.</L>
<L>Search, <HI>Satyr,</HI> search, a deep Incision make;</L>
<L>The Poyson's strong, the Antidore's too weak.</L>
<L>'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute,</L>
<L>And down-right English <HI>Englishmen</HI> confute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride;</L>
<L>And with keen Phrase repel the Vicious Tide.</L>
<L>To <HI>Englishmen</HI> their own beginnings show,</L>
<L>And ask them why they slight hteir Neighbours so.</L>
<L>Go back to Elder Times, and Ages past,</L>
<L>And Nations into long Oblivion cast;</L>
<L>To Old <HI>Britainnia</HI>'s Youthful Days retire,</L>
<L>And there for <HI>True-Born Englishmen</HI> enquire.</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI> freely will disown the Name,</L>
<L>And hardly knows her self from whence they came:</L>
<L>Wonders that They of all men shou'd pretend</L>
<L>To <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and for a Name contend.</L>
<L><PB N="$" REF="3"/>
Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell,</L>

<L>With Uniformity of Service, he</L>
<L>Reigns with a general Aristocracy.</L>
<L>No Nonforming Sects disturb his Reign,</L>
<L>For of his Yoak there's very few complain.</L>
<L>He knows the Genius and the Inclination,</L>

<L>With what applause his Stories did we tell?</L>
<L>Stories which <HI>Europe</HI>`s Volumes largely swell.</L>
<L>We counted him an Army in our Aid:</L>
<L>Where he commanded, no man was afraid.</L>
<L>His Actions with a constant Conquest shine,</L>

<L>On Strangers, <HI>Germans, Hugonots,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI></L>
<L>And seldom does his great Affairs of State,</L>
<L>To <HI>English</HI> Counsellors communicate.</L>
<L>The Fact might very well be answer`d thus,</L>
<L>He has so often been betray`d by us,</L>
<L>He must have been a Madman to rely</L>
<L>On <HI>English</HI> G—ns Fidelity.</L>
<L>For laying other Arguments aside,</L>
<L>This Thought might mortify our <HI>English</HI> Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>

<L>The King himself is shelter`d from their Snare</L>

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THen let us boast of Ancestors no more,</L>
<L>Or Deeds of Heroes done in days of Yore,</L>
<L>In latent Records of the Ages past,</L>
<L>Behind the Rear of Time, in long Oblivion plac'd▪</L>
<L>For if our Virtues must in Lines descend,</L>
<L>The Merit with the Families would end:</L>
<L>And Intermixtures would most fatal grow;</L>
<L>For Vice would be Hereditary too;</L>
<L>The Tainted Blood wou'd of necessity,</L>
<L>In voluntary Wickedness convey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vice, like Ill Nature for an Age or two,</L>
<L>May seem a Generation to pursue;</L>
<L>But Virtue seldom does regard the Breed,</L>
<L>Fools do the Wise, and Wise Men Fools succeed▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What is't to us, what Ancestors we had?</L>
<L>If Good, what better? or what worse, if Bad?</L>
<L>Examples are for Imitation set,</L>
<L>Yet all Men follow Virtue with Regret.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cou'd but our Ancestors retrieve their Fate,</L>
<L>And see their Offspring thus degenerate;</L>
<L>How we contend for Birth and Names unknown▪</L>
<L>And build on their past Actions, not our own▪</L>
<L>They'd cancel Records, and their Tombs deface,</L>
<L>And openly disown the vile degenerate Race:</L>
<L>For Fame of Families is all a Cheat,</L>
<L>'Tis Personal Vertue only makes us great.</L>
