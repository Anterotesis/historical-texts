Gen. Sir WILLIAM DRAPER against the Hon. Lieut. Gen. MURRAY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[As delivered by Sir <HI>CHARLES GOULD,</HI> Judge-Advocate General.]</HEAD>
<P>HAVING maturely considered the Evidence which has been pro∣duced, as well on the part of the Pro∣secutor as of the Defendant, with their relative observations,—and the sense of each Member having been taken dis∣tinctly upon the various matters of Charge,—</P>
<P>The Court are of the opinion herein after expressed concerning the same re∣spectively, as classed under the several general heads of accusation:</P>
<P>AS to the matter comprehended un∣der the general head or description of Flagrant Misbehaviour and Culpable Neglect, particularised in the follow∣ing instance of</P>
<P>A—<HI>Bad Conduct before the Siege,</HI></P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, with re∣gard to the FIRST Article,— <Q>Suffer∣ing “the troops in garrison at Fort St. Philip to be without their Offi∣cers, who lived at Mahon or George-Town, in the Month of February, 1780, although there was, and had for some time past been, an expecta∣tion of an attempt upon the Island; the fortress of Fort St. Philip's being then also, from a variety of defects, in a very bad condition to sustain ”the Enemy,</Q>—</P>
<P>That Lieut. Gen. Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,— <Q>Suf∣fering “the offices of the house called Stanhope's Tower to continue unde∣molished, which gave the Enemy the great advantage of immediately ta∣king post there, to the no small detri∣ment and annoyance of his Majesty's ”troops,—</Q></P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the THIRD Article,— <Q>Re∣pairing “the Great Road from Mahon to St. Philip's, by which the Enemy's artillery were brought up to their batteries with the utmost ease; and this, after he had repeatedly told the garrison, that they would be at∣tacked,”</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the FOURTH Article,— <Q>Ne∣glecting “to withdraw the troops and stores from Citadella and Fornello in proper time, although he had re∣ceived strong information from his Majesty's Minister at Florence, and from others, that the Enemy's de∣scent would speedily take place; whereby those troops and stores were ”intercepted and lost,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>First Part</HI> of the FIFTH Article,— <Q>Neglecting, on the descent “of the Spaniards, on the 19th of Au∣gust, 1781, to order the naval and other stores in the marine arsenal to be set on fire; whereby those impor∣tant and valuable magazines fell into ”the hands of the Enemy,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the SAME Article,— <Q>Omitting to station vessels “to prevent their rapid approach to Mahon, so that even his own goods, plans, and papers, were seized; and the troops retired into the Fort with ”great confusion, loss, and disgrace,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SIXTH Article,— <Q>Suf∣fering “the Enemy to carry on a Sap, and erect their batteries behind some weak stone walls; although it was obvious, that a proper and vigorous exertion of artillery would either have prevented, or at least greatly retarded, ”their approaches and construction,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SEVENTH Article,— <Q>Suf∣fering “the Enemy's barbet battery at the Russian hospital to stand unde∣molished for weeks together, although it might have been demolished by the heavy cannon and howitzers of the ”garrison,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the EIGHTH Article,— <Q>Giv∣ing “out an Order, dated October the 15th, 1781, in words to the follow∣ing ”effect:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“NO gun, or any piece of ordance, hereafter to be fired in day-light, without orders from the Com∣manding
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>manding Officer of Artillery, who can upon the smallest notice com∣municate with the Governor, who ”is ever watchful,</Q></P>
<P><Q>“which Order tended greatly to invite and facilitate the Enemy's approach, and numerous opportunities of ob∣structing their movements were there∣by ”lost,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. Gen. Murray is GUILTY; — although it does not appear to the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that the Order was is∣sued with any intention of invi∣ting the Enemy's approach;</P>
<P>And the Court do adjudge, That, in respect of his misconduct in this instance, he be reprimanded in such manner as his Majesty shall think fit to direct, for having given out an Order, which was de∣trimental to his Majesty's service, and excluded the Lieutenant-Go∣vernor from an authority with which a junior Officer was in∣vested.</P>
<P>Upon the NINTH Article,— <Q>Or∣dering “several ships, and their con∣tents, to a great amount, to be sunk; among others, the Minorca, a new frigate, which might have escaped in safety with only thirty five hands, and the General Murray privateer, with twenty hands; which vessels might have been usefully employed ”for the King's service,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>B—<HI>As to the Instances of Bad Conduct during the Siege,</HI></P>
<P>FIRST, The Court are of opinion upon the FIRST Article,— <Q>Giving “out in public orders on the 8th day of January last, (being the third day of the siege) That the Enemy's battering train was such as had never before been brought against any place of the first magnitude, since the inven∣tion of gunpowder; and that the garrison might be assured, that the defence of Fort St. Philip had little or no dependance upon its Artil∣lery—which order tended to aug∣ment the terror of the Enemy's at∣tack, and to cool the zeal and ardour of the Artillery-men of the garrison, and from the date of which order, the fire from the place became almost extinct, in the day time, and the ”Enemy redoubled their efforts</Q>—</P>
<P>That Lieut. Gen. Murray is NOT GUILTY, and do therefore acquit him;</P>
<P>And the Court think it incumbent upon them, to remark, that this Article of Charge contains a par∣tial quotation from the order in question, the whole whereof, al∣though injudiciously worded in the part alluded to, collectively taken, bears a very different con∣struction.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,— <Q>Aban∣doning, “and blowing up, all the places of arms, and communications of the Inner Covered Way, the night after he had given out, in public orders, that in case of alarm, he should be sound in the part of the

<PB N="6" REF="8"/>Inner Covered Way defended by the Fifty-First Regiment, and be the last man to retreat from it; the Enemy at that time not being in any part within three hundred yards of the Outer Covered Way, and no work having been taken, or even at∣tempted, ”</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the THIRD Article,— <Q>Order∣ing “the Officers in the Out Posts, to invite the Enemy into them, with a view, as he said, to blow them up ”with the works,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the FOURTH Article,— <Q>Sur∣rendering “the Fortress and Garrison, at a time when the Enemy, in the nearest point of approach towards the Covered Way of the Queen's Re∣doubt, was still at the distance of two hundred and fifty yards: and had opened no battery nearer than five hundred yards; when no work had been taken, or once assaulted except by cannon and shells, and not one of the numerous mines had been sprung; when the mortars for throwing stones, and the fougasses were prepared; and when there was no breach in any work below the Cordon, nor a possibility of it, un∣less the batteries of the Enemy had ”been advanced nearer,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>First Part</HI> of the FIFTH Article,— <Q>Desiring (with a view to “magnify the sickness of the garrison, which it is admitted was sickly, and thereby to justify his surrender) that the respective Commanding Officers would march out their corps as weak ”as possible,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the SAME Article,— <Q>Suppressing, in his report “to the Secretary of State, the men∣tion of the Marine Corps, which alone consisted of four hundred and thirty fit for duty, with one hundred and twenty-five Artillery-men, be∣sides Greeks, Algerines, and Cor∣sicans, ”</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>C—<HI>As to the Instance of Bad Con∣duct after the Siege,</HI>—viz.</P>
<P><Q>“Suffering the Spanish General to turn him out of the Fortress, before the Articles of Capitulation were signed; and not taking any hostages ”for the security of his Garrison,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<P>WITH regard to the matters com∣prehended under the general head or description of</P>
<P>D—<HI>Shameful Profusion and Mis∣application of the Public Money and Stores, particularised in the fol∣lowing Instances,</HI>—</P>
<P>FIRST, The Court are of Opinion, upon the FIRST Article,— <Q>Expend∣ing “nine hundred pounds in the pur∣chase of some wool, to make about seven traverses, on the top of the Castle, although with the common materials of cask and canteen stones, four or five pounds for each would ”have sufficed,</Q>—</P>
<P>That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,— <Q>Mis∣applying “the Masons, Artificers, and Labourers, by causing them to work on the offices of Stanhope's Tower, ”for his own emolument,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the THIRD Article,— <Q>Buy∣ing, “or being concerned in several Privateers, under pretence of esta∣blishing Packet-Boats to go to Italy for Letters; the Crews of which Pri∣vateers were chiefly taken from the service of the Fort, and paid and victualled from the Public Money and Stores, and the Garrison's Am∣munition sent and expended on ”board the said Privateers,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the FOURTH Article,— <Q>Un∣necessarily “purchasing the Hannah Privateer, on the Public Account, at the expence of between Three and ”Four Thousand Pounds,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the FIFTH Article,— <Q>Un∣necessarily “bringing a considerable charge on the Public, by making Two Colonels, Four Lieutenant-Colonels, Two Majors, and a great number of other Officers, who re∣ceived the pay of their new appoint∣ments, although the Four Battalions in Garrison were at low numbers, and all their Field Officers present (one excepted;) besides several Bre∣vet Majors,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the matters com∣prehended under the general head or description of</P>
<P>E — <HI>Rapacity and Extortion, particularised in the following In∣stances,</HI></P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, upon the FIRST Article,— <Q>Obliging the “Troops and Inhabitants to receive in payment a Guinea as Four and Twenty Shillings; at which rate the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>Fifty Thousand Pounds sent by Go∣vernment for Contingencies were is∣sued, to the great discontent and detriment of the Troops and Inha∣bitants,”</Q>—</P>
<P>That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,— <Q>Ex∣acting “a large Sum, by an arbitrary Imposition on all Auctions, to the great loss of the parties concerned in them; and notwithstanding he agreed to take a fixed Allowance from Government, in lieu of all ”Perquisites,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. Gen. Murray is GUILTY—and do adjudge, that he be repri∣manded in such manner, as His Majesty shall think fit to direct, for having taken a perquisite im∣properly, and contrary to the apparent intention of Govern∣ment, when a fixed allowance was made for satisfying all contin∣gencies:</P>
<P>And the Court, inasmuch as it has been suggested by Lieut. General Murray, in the course of his de∣fence to this Article of Charge, that his receiving, as a perquisite, a moiety of the see of one and half <HI>per cent.</HI> paid to the Auctioneer upon the sale of prize goods, is conformable to the practice which obtains at Gibraltar, think them∣selves indispensibly obliged to ob∣serve, that there has not been laid before them any evidence, nor do they see any ground whatever to suppose, that any such perquisite is taken, or claimed, by the Go∣vernor of Gibraltar.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the matters com∣prehended under the general head or description of</P>
<P>F—<HI>Oppression and Cruelty, par∣ticularised in the following In∣stances,</HI></P>
<P>FIRST, The Court are of opinion upon the FIRST Article,— <Q>Wantonly “incensing the minds of the principal Gentry of the Island against His Majesty's Government, by most vio∣lently disarming and disgracing them, because a Deserter had not been dis∣covered, ”and given up,</Q>—</P>
<P>That Lieut. Gen. Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the SECOND Article,— <Q>Per∣sonally “beating several Spanish Pri∣soners, who were standing at the door of their prison, breathing a purer air,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court are of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the THIRD and last Article,— <Q>“Imprisoning a man of good character, named Goya, for many weeks, with∣out sufficient cause, and without bringing him to any trial, or exami∣nation; under which confinement ”Goya destroyed himself,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Lieut. General Murray is NOT GUILTY; and do therefore acquit him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears to the Court, from the evidence,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>That Lieut. General Murray did conduct himself with great zeal, courage, and firmness, in the de∣fence of Fort St. Philip,—That the place was not half garrisoned,—had not any prospect of relief,—and was not given up, till it was become, from the enfeebled state of the Garrison, no longer tenable;</P>
<P>And that several of the Articles of Charge, which have been preferred against Lieut. Gen. Murray, are frivolous and ill-founded.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the matter of Per∣sonal Complaint exhibited by Sir William Draper, who represents, That he has been personally ag∣grieved and wronged by Lieut. Gen. Murray, in four several in∣stances,—</P>
<P>As to the FIRST Article of Com∣plaint,— <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray “issued an order on the 15th day of October last, tending to dishonour and disgrace him, and to prevent him from doing his duty as Lieute∣nant ”Governor,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper is founded in this Article of Complaint, as it does appear to them, that the order to which the Complaint refers, did tend to dishonour and disgrace him.</P>
<P>As to the SECOND Article of Com∣plaint,— <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray “falsely charged him with an attempt to take the command from him, the ”Governor in Chief,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, that Sir William Draper has not sustained the grievance which this Article supposes, as the words contained in Gen. Murray's letter of the 16th of January, 1782, which has been adduced as evidence of the fact, do not, in their judgement, im∣port a charge of any actual attempt made to take the command from him; but, in unison with the rest of the letter, express strongly Lieut. Gen. Murray's sense of Sir William Draper's conduct, which appeared to him calculated to enervate his authority and com∣mand.</P>
<P>As to the THIRD Article of Com∣plaint,— <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray “superseded him in his command, as Lieutenant Governor, without just ”cause,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper was not aggrieved or wronged in this instance, the supersession being no more than Sir William Draper appears to have expected, in case Lieut. Gen. Murray did not think it proper to assemble a Council of War, nor than his letter to Lieut. Gen. Murray warranted and called for.</P>
<P>As to the FOURTH Article of Com∣plaint,— <Q>That Lieut. Gen. Murray “gave out, that the said Lieutenant Governor had advised him to surren∣der ”the place sooner than he did,</Q>—</P>
<P>The Court is of opinion, That Sir William Draper is not founded in this Article of Complaint, the fact of Lieut. Gen. Murray having at any time expressed himself to that effect not being supported by evidence.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<P>The Court, before they quit this sub∣ject, conceive it to be a duty abso∣lutely incumbent upon them, to point out some very offensive words, which have appeared before them in evidence, contained in a letter from Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.—"Your insi∣nuation that I am attempting to take the command from you, is <HI>false</HI> and <HI>infamous;</HI>" and also an expression contained in an answer to the said letter, from Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.—"As to the per∣sonal abuse, I shall do justice to myself, you may be assured, when the proper time arrives:"—and humbly to submit the same to his Majesty's consideration, that his Majesty may, if in his wisdom he shall think fit, interpose his royal authority and injunction, to pre∣vent the most serious consequences between the parties.</P>
<P>ON the 30th of January, the Court-Martial being re-convened, pursuant to an Order from His Majesty, Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper were called into Court; when the Judge-Advocate General read to them the foregoing determination of the Court-Martial, upon the several matters of charge and complaint which had been referred, by His Majesty's Warrant, for their decision; together with His Majesty's pleasure thereon, as follows; namely,</P>
<P><Q>“THAT the King had declared his Royal Approbation of the opinion of the Court-Martial, upon every point; but that, in consideration as well of the zeal, courage, and firmness, with which Lieut. Gen. Murray appears to the Court to have conducted himself, in the desence of Fort St. Philip, as of his former long and approved services, His Majesty had been gra∣ciously pleased to dispense with any other reprimand, in respect of the misconduct whereof he has in two instances been found guilty, than that ”which the Sentence of the Court-Martial in itself virtually conveys:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And that His Majesty had, at the same time, expressed much concern, that an Officer of Sir William Draper's rank, and distinguished character, should suffer his judgement to be so far perverted, by any sense of per∣sonal grievance, as to view the general conduct of his superior Officer in an unfavourable light; and, in consequence, to exhibit several charges, which the Court-Martial, after a diligent investigation, have deemed to ”be frivolous, or ill-founded.</Q></P>

<P>It is not illegal; Sir William Draper certainly is competent to give his evidence: I am glad he tenders himself so openly at the outset, before he has called in the evidence to it.—If any member has a doubt about it, he has only to rise, and have the Court cleared, while we consider of it.—Does Gen.

<P>If the order is read, and Gen. Murray will admit it, it will save Sir William Draper the trouble of giving evidence.</P>

<P>I suppose Sir William Draper does not mean to prove the order by his evidence, but what is alledged concerning the order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think, that Sir William Draper, who is my accuser (and not a very mild one) ought not to give evidence as to the consequences of the order. The order is clear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper tenders an information to the Crown; which the Crown, upon advising with its proper officers, is of opinion, ought to be sent to trial by a Court-Martial.—
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>Does it strike any person, that the per∣son giving the information, is precluded from giving evidence?—How far it may be suspicious, how far it may be desirable, are all circumstances for the Court to consider. The question is now, Whether he is a competent witness? I rather wish to speak my sentiments upon it in public.—If you choose to have the court cleared, it is my duty to attend you; and you sometimes do me the honour to call for my opinion, and then it is my duty to give it; but it does not strike me at present, that the situation of Sir William Draper, as the accuser, can effect his competency, as a witness. If we apply it to the ordi∣nary courts of law, suppose the case that frequently occurs:—Does not the person who is robbed, who tenders the information, and who conducts the prosecution, always give evidence?—If there appears, from the whole of the case, any thing like rancour, ulti∣mately the Court will give less credit, to be sure, to a witness under those circumstances, than if he were not un∣der such circumstances: but we are only now speaking to the competency; and I submit my opinion to the Court, that Sir William Draper is competent to give evidence.</P>

The pusillanimity of the Enemy is sufficiently conspi∣cuous to the most undiscerning person in this garrison; the me∣thod which can be devised to make them brave, is by accus∣toming them to an ineffectual ”fire from us.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you ever observed opportunities of annoying the Enemy, and checking their progress, lost, by the order that has been just read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have seen opportuni∣ties, where the Enemy might have been annoyed, if the Artillery Officers had had the liberty of firing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg you will men∣tion any instance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the best of my recollection, one instance I do remember. There was a <HI>sortie</HI> made to destroy a strong sentry-box, which was pretty near to the Quay-guard, the place where we usually kept a guard before the siege. I was on the top of the Castle, with my perspective glass, in order to see the movements of the <HI>sortie;</HI> I observed the Enemy come down in numbers be∣hind the walls that were between the Quay-guard and George Town; I counted one hundred and sixty Grena∣diers behind one wall, besides many that had taken post behind other walls: I remarked to some that were about me, that it was a shame the Artillery did not fire, because the Enemy were near enought to be annoyed by them;
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>and, to the best of my recollection, I addressed myself to Capt. Fead, of the Artillery. I don't swear it was Capt. Fead; but, to the best of my recollec∣tion, it was him. I shewed him the Enemy; I gave him my glass, and he counted pretty nearly the same number I had done: I told him, it was a shame the cannon did not fire, and some of the mortars, because I was very sure, if they did, the Enemy must be much annoyed by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know the day of the month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: I think it was in August that the <HI>sortie</HI> was sent out upon that occasion: the orderly book will shew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the reason given you for not firing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. Fead, or the Gentleman I addressed myself to, said he could not fire without an order; and he said he would go immediately to Major Wal∣ton, to receive his orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did the Artillery fire in consequence of any orders upon this occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the best of my recollection they did; but it was then too late, because the Enemy, we had seen, were then moving off: they did not fire at the time; they might have taken an advantage of the Enemy; but, to the best of my recollection, a few did fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you observe any other opportunity lost, in consequence of the order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you, by this order, judge that you yourself was incapacitated to give orders to fire, without Major Walton's leave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The words of the order it∣self, I should think, would explain this question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think I had any au∣thority to order the Artillery to fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you judge that I myself was incapacitated by that order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is all matter of opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to ask this question, from what I saw in the news-papers this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It has been proved, over and over again, in evidence, that the Ar∣tillery should not fire without a com∣mand from Major Walton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The question is, Whether he thinks I am comprehended in that order, as Lieut. General and Lieut. Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The next in command is as much so as the youngest officer. It goes to include every person, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever observe any marks of insanity, or insufficiency, in me, so as to think me incapable of giving orders?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never did, but though the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you ascertain at what distance from the works of the garrison the wall was that you saw those Grenadiers behind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot ascertain the real di∣stance; I should judge, from the eye, the wall was about eleven hundred, or twelve hundred yards, that they were behind, from the top of the Castle where I was; they might be a good deal nearer some of the outworks. The wall they were drawn up behind, was nearer a good deal than George Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mention to the Court what other works these Grenadiers, that
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>were posted behind the wall, could be seen from.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should imagine, from all the works on the north and north-west sides of the garrison: I think they might plainly be seen from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether or not the Artillery, that fired upon those troops, did not fire immediately after the <HI>sortie</HI> came in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was some little firing; I think it was after the <HI>sortie</HI> returned into the garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it soon after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot ascertain: I think the <HI>sortie</HI> had returned into the garrison; I think it was much about, or just at the time the <HI>sortie</HI> returned into the gar∣rison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You said other op∣portunities had been lost; I desire you will mention those opportunities to the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot particularise the oppor∣tunities; but I have seen many in∣stances where parties of the Enemy have passed from one post to another, that I thought might have been an∣noyed by the Artillery, if the Artillery had been made use of against them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whereabouts, and at what distance from the forts, did you see those parties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't pretend to judge the di∣stance; but I have seen them moving towards Col. Mackellar's; I have seen them moving towards Stanhope's Tower; and I have frequently seen par∣ties in arms passing towards Turk's-Mount.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did these parties re∣main any considerable time in our sight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes they were hid by their own works: then they would ap∣pear in openings as they were marching along: sometimes I have had a view of them for three, four, or five mi∣nutes; I have seen them passing where no works have been thrown up— through the fields.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Q.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were those passing through the fields, within the distance of being an∣noyed by the Garrison?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think they might, both by shells, and by artillery too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you could as∣certain the distance these men were from us, which you saw in the fields?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Those men I saw in the fields, passing from one work to the other, might be at the distance of fourteen or fifteen hundred yards; I mean, from the top of the Castle: I have seen them in several places, some places nearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understand that the Colonel thinks, at fourteen or fifteen hundred yards men passing in file might be annoyed by the Artillery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is the purport of his evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg to ask, what is the distance of the space between the top of the Castle and the outworks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The situations of the outworks were at different distances: the re∣doubts of the outward line, I should suppose the farthest of them to be about four hundred yards or more; but I cannot attempt to ascertain any certain distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From whence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From the top of the Castle the Marlborough was a great deal father; I cannot pretend to ascertain the di∣stance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you think they could have been seen from the Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sure they might, in several places.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At what distance were they from Fort Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot pretend to form any idea: there was a cove run up to the right side of the Marlborough, and then a gully between where the men were and the Marlborough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot ascertain the distance from Fort Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, because there was a gully between the Fort, and the fields they were marching over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is a barranca.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A barranca; that is the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether the <HI>sortie</HI> would have been in danger if the Garrison had fired sooner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sure it would not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you ascertain nearly the distance of the Marlborough from Stanhope's Tower?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I cannot form the least judgment of the distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to know how often you was at the Marlborough du∣ring the blockade, and at what time of the day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I had no duty there, I was not in the Marlborough, I believe, during the blockade, above twice. I believe I might be twice; I am not positive whether it was during the blockade. I was there once during the blockade, and at the commencement of the siege:—I think I was twice there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was you there once during the siege?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I am not quite clear of: I think I was once there during the blockade, and I think once after the siege opened; I am not positive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are sure you was there once during the blockade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At what time of day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say: towards the after∣noon; between one and three o'clock, I think it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What period do you call the beginning of the siege?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When the Enemy opened their batteries; it was, I think, on the 6th of January.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to know if you saw any parties from the Marlbo∣rough when you was there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I cannot say <HI>parties:</HI> I did see some Men moving behind the wall that leads up to Turk's-Mount; but I cannot call them <HI>parties.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murra.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had they arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I saw their arms with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to know at what distance that road of communi∣cation up to Turk's-Mount was from the Marlborough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot pretend to say the di∣stance of the road from the Marlbo∣rough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were they upon that road?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They were not in the road. Where I saw them, was behind a wall which they had thrown up, leading to∣wards Turk's-Mount. An angle of that wall came opposite to the salient angle of the Marlborough, which I judge to be about the distance of three hundred yards, or between two and three hundred yards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to know what number of pieces from the Marlborough could be brought to bear upon that last wall that you have described?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot pretend to say. I think some few might have been brought to bear upon that part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you mean, brought to bear through the embra∣sures. Whether you think any cannon
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>could be fired upon that spot, through the embrasures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mean through the embrasures. I think, to the best of my recollection, there was a grasshopper in the salient angle, which could have commanded it; but I am not sure whether it was a grasshopper or wall-piece that was in the salient angle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't say any thing about the grasshopper in your evidence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No. I am not sure whether it was a grasshopper, or a wall-piece.</P>
</SP>

<P>Did you not look upon yourself as comprehended in that order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not. I saw an order from Major Walton to the Artillery, not to fire; but I could not obey that order; I did not look upon it as di∣rected to me. I had a discretionary power from Gen. Murray to fire as I should see occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Whether the Artil∣lery-Officer at Fort Marlborough at this time had not an order from Major Walton not to fire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Every one of that Fort was un∣der my command; and doubtless were to obey my orders. No order from Major Walton could affect me. There was an order from Major Walton to the Artillery not to fire.</P>

<P>At a time when a party of the Enemy way-laid a party of our people who used to gather greens upon the glacis, there were twenty or thirty men very near the Fort, in a place of con∣cealment: in their retreat I could have galled them very severely, had it not been for the order, as I had three guns which bore upon them.</P>

<P>To the best of my recollection, near the Old Road I saw some of the Enemy coming to work: they were carrying some stones, as I suppose, to make a breast-work across this road, which was then open, to cover them∣selves in carrying their fascines, &amp;c. I sent a man up to the Castle, to re∣port the same to Major Walton: that man remained, to the best of my re∣collection, near two hours. On his returning I asked him what he staid so long for: he informed me that Major Walton had employed him about some business. At this time I could but barely see the heads of the Enemy, as they passed by, in making their works, in the time the man was absent; and I had no orders to fire. If it is proper to mention the man's name, it is Ti∣mothy Racket.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper; which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE order of the 15th of Octo∣ber is not fairly transcribed by my Accuser, as has been shewn to the Court; and I must again beg the whole order may be produced, and read.</P>
<P>The young Officers of the garrison began to be tired of their inactive con∣finement: they wished to fire the can∣non at single men, or imaginary objects; some went so far as to fire at Bugats, or figures dressed like men, which the Enemy had exhibited in ridicule of our ineffectual firing. To indulge the young Officers in this propensity, I or∣dered wall-pieces to be fixed on the salient angle of the outworks, which I permitted them to use at discre∣tion for some time; but finding all animadversions ineffectual, I issued the order in question.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this order, great part of our ammunition would have been uselessly expended, before the Enemy began their batteries (and even with this precaution, it has evidently appeared that we should have been de∣ficient in powder, had not an unforeseen sickness shortened the time of our de∣fence): besides, as I have observed in my answer to the Sixth Charge, the embrasures and merlons of the batteries would have been destroyed by our own idle firing. The order, however, did not extend to firing in the night, when the operations of the Enemy were chiefly carried on, nor to the detached work of the Marlborough; and I besides ex∣plained the intent of it, and gave a reasonable latitude to those officers who were not within its spirit.</P>
<P>As to Capt. Parry, he was among those who were most wanton, and least controulable in the direction of his fire. It was upon a complaint from Major Walton that he was trespassing against my orders in this respect, that I threa∣tened to bring him to a General Court-Martial: but as to treating him in the
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>indignant manner he has represented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">Capt. Parry swore, that Gen. Murray raised his cane over him in a menacing manner, at the time he threatened to bring him to a Court-Martial;—Lieut. Douglas, who was present at the time, swore, that no such circumstance happened.</NOTE>, I deny it, as has been proved by Lieut. Douglas, who was present. Capt. Parry has given evidence, that at the Bourgeois battery, opposite the Queen's, there was a discontinuance of firing for some few days; although it has been proved that this battery was not begun until the night between the 9th and 10th of December, and Capt. Parry acknow∣ledges he went to the Hospital on the 5th of December, and I shall likewise shew that he did not return from thence until the 8th of January following. Another part of this gentleman's evi∣dence is, the saying he fired upon carriages in the road from the Guard-house to Stanhope's Tower, when I shall shew it was shut up by the traverses; besides the improbability of the enemy's using a road entirely exposed to our fire, when they had another, in the rear of their batteries, more convenient, and properly protected. Col. Acklom's evidence goes to prove our not firing, on the day of the <HI>sortie,</HI> at men not interrupting our operations whom I wished to invite nearer. I hope the Court will be sufficiently convinced of the propriety of my conduct in reser∣ving our fire on that occasion; and I shall shew that only two or three guns could bear on that place mentioned by the Colonel, where the Enemy was as∣sembled. And here it is remarkable, that when Col. Acklom is called upon to summon all his reflection, and par∣ticularise any other instances when and where he saw the omission of firing that might otherwise annoy the Enemy, he mentions a time when he crossed the water and visited the Marlborough, from whence many of the Enemy were seen who might have been destroyed; but the next Evidence who appears (Major Elford) the officer who commanded at the Marlborough, tells the Court without hesitation, that he never was restrained from killing his Enemies by this order, and that he fired at all times when he thought proper.</P>
<P>I shall make no further remark on this evidence, than Col. Acklom's own acknowledgement, that he never saw a siege before; a remark which is not only a sufficient answer to similar evi∣dence from other officers, but affords the strongest support to the order, the propriety of which has been questioned, since, in pointing out such instances as omissions, they shew the necessity of the restraint.</P>

<P>Do you recollect what the effect of that very heavy fire was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can only answer for the effect of the howitzer; many of the shells from the howitzer sunk so deep in the battery, that I did not perceive any ef∣fect from them; they appeared to me, at that distance, to be sand-bags.</P>

<P>How many shells did you fire from your howitzer in twenty-four hours?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Major Walton ordered me there; I was only there partially, part of either day being sent by the Commanding Officer upon different duty. During the time I was at the howitzer, there were forty or fifty shells fired: there were, I believe, betwixt twenty and thirty shells fired from it in two hours.</P>

<P>Did Major Walton continue the fire from that howitzer after you had left it?</P>

<P>I can't say, because I was sent to other parts of the garrison.—I left Major Walton at the howitzer when I went from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I beg leave to observe to the Court, that this evidence is not foreign to the purpose.—This order was in force till after the position of the Enemy's batteries was known; then there was a fresh order given out, to fire upon those batteries, with all possi∣ble vigour: the time Mr. Shand has been examined to, was preceding that order.—I produce this evidence to shew that we were attentive to fire upon ob∣jects that were proper to fire at.</P>

<P>In the hollows: there was a a passage, but so small that I could not turn my horse in it—it was with some difficulty I got through it—the two traverses were, in fact, a continuation of the line, only leaving a space for men on foot, or for one horse, to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gen. Murray, do you pro∣duce this evidence to invalidate the evidence of another witness, or other∣wise?—It does not go to the charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I mean to prove, that there could be no carriages upon the road which Capt. Parry described, and which he said he had fired at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is just the reason of my asking the question, because that goes to invalidate Capt. Parry's evi∣dence: but it does not apply to the charge now under the consideration of the Court; for the charge is, giving out the order of the 15th of October.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. Parry said in his evidence, that he was restricted from firing on carriages upon the road. In answer to that, I conceive it is now a proper time to shew the Court the impossibility of carriages being on that road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If it is to contradict Capt. Parry's evidence, then Capt. Parry's evidence should be read, and be parti∣cularly attended to by the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe Capt. Parry spoke what he did not think; but I believe he mistook the place from whence the sound came. Sounds are in the night very deceitful: he might imagine those sounds to proceed from the Old Stanhope's Tower Road; therefore all I mean by calling this Evidence, is to shew that Capt. Parry was mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then we ought to have reference to Capt. Parry's evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The evidence lies before the Court. The Court are cer∣tainly the best judges of that; but it is natural for me to vindicate myself, and to give the Court a reason why I would not suffer an Officer to fire at sounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Captain Parry's main exa∣mination was upon the Sixth Article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Sixth and Eighth Articles are so interwoven, that it is hardly possible to separate them: but I beg not to take up a minute's time of the Court about it; I shall be satisfied that you may do as you please. I can make no distinction myself be∣tween the Sixth Article and the Eighth: they are both to the subject of firing, though they are separated into distinct charges. I had scouts out every night; and by them I was informed, that the carriages were not upon that road, but behind it, in the barrancas; and at the times the scouts were out, it became necessary to order them not to fire that way. If I am to account for every shot, I am ready to do so, as far as it lies in my power. I beg the Court will excuse me for taking up so much of their time; but I am trying for my reputation, and it is very natural for me to be anxious to take care of it: I have studied every thing in my power to make the Trial short.</P>

<P>I should think not.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In some cases they are; but in general the top of the Castle was the best place to perceive every motion of the Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Could the Officers in the outworks fire till an order had been sent from the Castle?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There were one day a few lurk∣ing men, that wanted to cut off the

<P>I remember their firing at small groupes of four or five men passing on the farthest ridge of the neck that joined Cape Mola to the main land; I did not observe whether they took out their coins or not.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understood him that he blamed the Officers or men of the Artillery.—Except Sir William Draper in his out∣line, and the Commandant in the Marl∣borough at his own work, I do not un∣derstand that the Officers of the line commanded the great guns.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>THIS and the next Article I withdraw, because they stand as part of a charge against Gen. Murray in a civil capacity: as there is a complaint lodged in a civil Court, I drop it as a military charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir George Howard, as these two charges affect my honour as a Military Man, and as a Gentleman, I think, in as great a degree as any other that has been exhibited against me, I do beg it may be investigated by this Court, and that their opinion may be given upon it: I shall think myself much in∣jured, indeed, if it is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Does what you have said go to both the articles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: I shall beg every thing that has been alledged against me may be investigated by the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All I have to say, is, I look upon it as a civil matter, and therefore drop the two charges entirely. The Court will put what interpretation they please upon it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court has taken these matters under consideration, and they have stated two questions, which they have directed me to propose to the parties for their information. The first is, Is any suit already commenced in any of his Majesty's ordinary Courts of Judica∣ture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do I, relative to those two points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understood Sir William Draper to say there had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A complaint had been lodged before the Privy Council: that Gentleman, Mr. Sayer, I believe, knows it, and can give an account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It will still be neces∣sary, perhaps, for the Court to be re∣solved, whether a prosecution is going on of any kind; but the other question is, If any suit is depending in any of his Majesty's ordinary Courts of Judicature, the Court wish to be informed, whether it be a civil action at the suit of the party for damages, or in the nature of a criminal prosecution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I myself only know that there was a complaint lodged to his Majesty's Privy Council while I was in the island of Minorca; that I know very well, because I have here copies of the complaints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot the Court be satisfied, by some means, whether there is any process going forwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know. I know that these were complaints from the inhabitants of the island, and that Mr. Sayer was concerned for Gen. Murray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There certainly were complaints lodged before the Privy
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>Council prior to the island being taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court desire an answer to the two questions the Judge-Advocate has mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know of nothing more than I have mentioned, that there was a complaint to the Privy Council, from the inhabitants of the island of Minorca, to these two very articles; and it was for that very reason I wished to drop them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Both parties, I think, said they did not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know that there is any thing now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You hear, Gen. Murray, Sir William Draper has said he does not know there is any thing now; we shall be obliged to you to favour us with a precise answer to this question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At this moment I do not believe that there is any prosecution against me for those two articles of complaint to the Privy Council; because, the island being taken, I imagine the process is dropped; and therefore, if I have not an opportunity now of vin∣dicating myself from those two accusa∣tions, I shall have none whatever of do∣ing it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>[The Court cleared.—After some time, Sir William Draper, Gen. Murray, and the audience, were again admitted.]</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court has taken this matter under consideration, and I have received their direction to inform both parties, that, although the matter alledged by these two articles of charge may be within the cognizance of his Majesty's ordinary Courts of Judicature, yet, as it does not appear that there is any process in any of his Majesty's or∣dinary Courts of Judicature, and as they tend to affect the character of Gen. Murray, they have for these reasons, and more especially as the Defendant has requested that the Court will take cognizance thereof, determined to pro∣ceed in the investigation of both the ar∣ticles of charge.</P>

<P>Did you find any in∣convenience from the establishment of an auctioneer, according to my procla∣mation?</P>

<P>We found no other inconvenience than paying that one and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> We have had it transacted for less than one and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> prior to the last establishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you was not obliged, prior to that establishment, to have all prize goods sold in the Court of Admi∣ralty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We did not think ourselves obliged, because some agents appointed another person as an auctioneer, to sell their prizes, and the Admiralty found no fault with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did those other auc∣tioneers give any security to the captors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None that I recollect; but most of the agents employed others, and not the auctioneers, to collect their money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did these private auctioneers keep a regular register of what they sold, so that every one con∣cerned might have recourse to it when∣ever he thought proper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The auctioneer kept a regular book of sales; most of the agents kept a counter-book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think the establishment I made, was a check upon the agents of privateers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A check; in what respect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By keeping a register, to which all men concerned might at all times have recourse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was certainly useful for that purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you did not think the imposition of one and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> a great check upon your trade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We thought it too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose the witness means, that he and his partner thought it too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was the two and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> paid to the Admiralty after the auc∣tioneer was appointed by Gen. Murray, who had one and an half <HI>per cent.?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then, when Gen. Murray appointed an auctioneer, and imposed a duty of one and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> the duty of two and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> paid before to the Admiralty, ceased?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It did, unless for what things they actually sold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then in what did the incon∣venience consist; in laying the duty of one and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> when an auc∣tioneer was appointed, instead of two and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> to the Admiralty, before the appointment of an auctioneer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper, which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT had been usual in Minorca, for the Officers of the Court of Admi∣ralty to sell the prizes condemned in that Court, for which they charged three and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> and other high fees, for holding the money, &amp;c. with∣out keeping any regular accounts, where all persons concerned might have re∣course, to know the nature, value, and amount of the goods sold, and establish their claims on the proceeds accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>The Proprietors, and others con∣cerned in Privateers, represented to me the necessity of appointing a Public Auctioneer for this purpose, on the same footing with the one established at Gibraltar, who could give sufficient security, as the Officers at the Admi∣ralty Court at Mahon were represented by them to be indigent men, and not fit to be trusted with large sums of money, without security.</P>
<P>It therefore became my duty, as Vice-Admiral, to examine into this matter. I first wrote to Gibraltar for information, and regulated the sales and public auctions accordingly, as appears by the proclamations; by which the captors saved two <HI>per cent.</HI> and it has been proved, by one of the Agents, Mr. Arthur Gibbons, who was dissatis∣fied with the regulation, because it ex∣posed his transactions, that the parties actually saved one <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>In this I imitated the Governor of Gibraltar, who is on the same footing with the Governor of Minorca, with regard to having a fixed salary, which is to be considered as the perquisite of the Vice-Admiral, and not the Gover∣nor; and, when the Court looks at my commission as Vice-Admiral, and considers the trouble I had in that de∣partment, I am sure they will not think a perquisite incident to war, and a se∣parate office, affecting transient people, as any breach of my agreement with Government; especially as I had the example of Gibraltar to vindicate my conduct; and when, by such regula∣tion, a very considerable saving was made to the Captors, and others con∣cerned. My Accuser has always called this a duty; but I hope the Court will regard it as a moderate com∣mission.</P>
<P>The Agents and Captors were evi∣dently better, in all respects, under my regulation, and neutral disputed property was secured and sorth-com∣ing.</P>
<P>I dare say my Accuser will do me the justice to acknowledge, that I very early acquainted him of this perquisite, and told him I looked upon it as a right to my successor in the command; and therefore, if I had had the inclination to give up that right, I did not think I could do it, in justice to him. Mr. Bayne, the Auctioneer, will declare he was ordered to lay before Sir William Draper his accounts, that he, Sir Wil∣liam, might be thoroughly master of
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>what he had a right to, if my solici∣tations to quit the command had been assented to: this shews there was no mystery in the affair. The Court, af∣ter what I have candidly said and avowed, are to judge whether the half of the Auctioneer's fees was not a fair and ostensible perquisite of the Vice-Admiral of Min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rea and Gibraltar: if I had not thought it such, I certainly would not have claimed it. I do not think it proper, at present, to say how I disposed of it: it is sufficient to assure the Court, I did not put it into my own pocket.</P>

<P>"AS Mr. Sutherland, the Judge of our Vice-Admiralty Court, has been taken by the French, on his passage from Nice to this place, we are entirely at a loss how to act in point of fees, &amp;c. on the commissions granted to the privateers, as well as the manner in which the Auc∣tioneer's business is carried on; you will therefore infinitely oblige us, in answer∣ing the following questions, his Excel∣lency intending to follow the mode esta∣blished at Gibraltar: <HI>First,</HI> What is paid for the warrant issued by the Governor to the Admiralty? and to whom does the foe belong? <HI>Secondly,</HI> What are the fees of the Court, for issuing the commission, condemnation, &amp;c. And, <HI>lastly,</HI> Whe∣ther the Auctioneer appointed by the Governor does not sell all such prizes as are put up to public sale? and what are his fees?—The spirit these people have for privateering is incredible: we have fitted out to the number of twenty, most of which have been particularly fortu∣nate in making many very considerable prizes: they send them in daily. We have now a French Consul, some fine ladies, and other gentlemen, passengers, in sight, on board a rich prize, laden with silk, cotton, and wool: there is another, that keeps company, laden with wool also.</P>

<P>"<HI>Answers to Mr. Secretary</HI> JOHNSON<HI>'S Queries.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Query</HI> I. WHAT is paid for the Warrant issued by the Governor to the Admiralty Court; and to whom do the fees belong?</P>
<P>"<HI>Answer.</HI> A Doubloon of fifteen Mex∣ico Cobs, paid to the Governor's Secre∣tary, at His Excellency's disposal—the same fee which we understand was paid last war for a like warrant.</P>
<P>"<HI>Query</HI> II. What are the fees of the Court, for issuing the commission, condemnation, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.?</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Answer.</HI> The fees on issuing com∣missions, it is presumed, ought, at least, to be as much as is paid in Eng∣land, which is said, by some of those who have obtained Letters of Marque there, to cost about Fifteen or Sixteen Guineas. What has been paid at this Office, on this occasion, is three Qua∣druples, besides what has been paid at the Secretary's Office.</P>
<P>"The Officers of the Vice-Admiralty Courts having no salaries whatever, they are not circumscribed to the fees, on business that occurs, or may occur; but it is in most cases left to custom, and the discretion of the Officers, to charge for their trouble, according to the nature of the business: and the usage here is, rather to be very mode∣rate than otherwise; but the Court has never been furnished with a table of fees; neither is it probable they will, unless the Officers were allowed salaries.</P>
<P>"The fees on condemnation fo prizes is by Act of Parliament limited to Ten Pounds on a vessel under one hundred tons, and Fifteen Pounds on one of one hundred tons, or upwards. Yet it is not rightly known here, how those fees, nor those on issuing commissions, ought to be divided among the Officers of the Court, <HI>viz.</HI> The Judge, Registrar, and Marshal. There are, it is true, addi∣tional charges in Prize Causes, for Proc∣tors, Translators, and Interpreters' fees, which the Court hath no interest in, and which vary, more or less, according to the nature of the business. There are also other fees, on entering claims, se∣curities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> particularly with regard to Neutral Vessels; but we are so far unable to give a table of fees for others, that we have found it necessary to write to our Friends in England, to procure us some information, with respect to their bills of costs there, for our own Government.</P>
<P>"Answered by the Registrar of the Admiralty-Court.</P>
<P>"<HI>Query</HI> III. Whether the Auctioneer, appointed by the Governor, does not sell all such prizes as are put up to public sale; and what are his fees?</P>
<P>"<HI>Answer.</HI> He does sell all such prizes, and has one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> fee.</P>
<P>"Answered by the Auctioneer."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here is the security given by Mr. Bayne, the Auctioneer, in twelve thousand pounds, if the Court will please to have it read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I apprehend the security is not under the consideration of the Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Court are the best judges of what is under their considera∣tion: I conceive that is one reason to prove the propriety of the regulation; it is called an arbitrary impost and charge: Neutral property might suffer greatly, if there was no security given; as was the case prior to my regulation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive the jet of this charge, is relative to what was supposed to be your share arising from the sale of the

<P>Can you tell the rea∣sons why they were dissatisfied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard it said, it was on account of their being restrained from selling the prize goods without public notice; by which means they were de∣prived of purchasing them at a lower rate than they otherwise would have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever hear that the Proprietors of the Privateers were dissatisfied with the regulation?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it evident that the proprietors of Privateers were secured in their property by the regulation?</P>

<P>I judged it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will now produce a copy of the King's regulation, giving me two thousand pounds in lieu of the revenues of the Arroval of St. Philip's. Prior to this regulation, the Governor's salary arose from the perquisites of this Arroval, which were very extraordinary: I complained of it, and would not take them, because I thought they were al∣ways the cause of feuds between the Governor and the people, and produced much disorder among the Troops; for the more wine they drank, the greater was the Governor's profit; therefore I obtained this establishment, in lieu of those perquisites from the Arroval, and in lieu of them alone.</P>
<P>I took this auction-fee, thinking I had a right to it as Vice-Admiral; and, as I shall answer to God at the last day, I did not pocket it, but gave it away, among other things. The Vice-Admiral has a great deal of trouble in time of war; and I did not think I ought to give up a perquisite from my successor.—Here is my commission as Vice-Admiral.</P>

<P>How much <HI>per cent.</HI> was taken at the auctions upon house∣hold goods?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought Mr. Bayne was only appointed auctioneer for prize goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My charge is, taking a sum of money upon all auctions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are we to understand, from Mr. Bayne's former evidence, that he spoke of other goods than prize goods?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If household goods were taken at sea, what <HI>per cent.</HI> was taken upon them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> they then are prize goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was Mr. Bayne auctioneer, not only for prize goods that might be taken at sea, but for the sale of other goods that might be sold in the Island?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for all auctions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It has all along been under∣stood as applying to prize goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I ask what the price was upon all household goods that were prize goods? His paper was produced before: I beg the account may be re∣ferred to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If household goods were taken at sea, they paid the same as others?</P>

<SP>

<P>The same.</P>

<P>Supposing an inhabitant wanted to sell his furniture, did you sell it for him?</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How much per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was taken upon all household goods sold at auctions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Five per cent. for household fur∣niture that were not prize goods. I never sold above thirty pounds worth of household furniture in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the esta∣blished fee of the auctioneer, upon household goods, before this proclama∣tion of mine?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Five per cent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was not there always a public auctioneer appointed by the Governor in time of peace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How much had he per cent. for what he sold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Five per cent. I made but one auction of household furniture during the time I was employed. Gen. Murray never claimed any thing upon the sale of household furniture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had Gen. Murray, or not, any part of that five per cent.?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He had. It was credited to him in that account by mistake, being mixed with other articles: Gen. Murray never claimed it, nor no other Governor; only what arose from prize goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible for me to ask Mr. Bayne any more questions. I hope that article in that account of Mr. Bayne's will be read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bayne, do you admit this account to be authentic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the sum in that article is, I see, 844 dollars; it being on household furniture, is to be reckoned at five per cent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was the auctioneer in the island established by the Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then every thing was sold by you; houses, or lands, or any thing taken in execution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; the island had an auctioneer of their own, that sold lands and houses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understood you, that the whole sum did not amount to more than thirty pounds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; I think not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The account there is 844 dollars; 500 dollars make 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How does that accord with what you said before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not read this account; it had slipped my memory: I believe that is right; but I know I sold very little household furniture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is 844 dollars the profit, at five per cent. upon what you sold, or the gross sum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The gross sum: the five per cent. is to be reckoned upon that sum. The nett sum that I received is the last sum in the column.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did the household goods you sold, sell for 844 dollars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And then you was to have five per cent. upon that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: it is about forty dollars; between eight and nine pounds sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you said you never sold more than thirty pounds worth, did you mean the sum the goods sold for, or your commission for selling them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It did not amount to more than thirty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I took down the witness's words, "that he never sold more than thirty pounds worth."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But in that I was deceived: I see it is 844 dollars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever sell any others than those?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: I lost my books, and I could refer to nothing but this paper. I should not have made the mistake, if I had seen that paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You say the five per cent. upon these goods amounted to eight or nine pounds sterling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; at most.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you that nine pounds sterling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It being, by mistake, mixed with the other accounts, Gen. Murray had a moiety of it; but the General never claimed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you brought these accounts to me, did I ever look at them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P><Q>“That Lieutenant-General <HI>MURRAY</HI> issued an Order on the 15th Day of October last, tending to dishonour and disgrace him (Sir <HI>WILLIAM DRAPER</HI>), and to ”prevent him from doing his Duty as Lieutenant Governor.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I Beg the Commis∣sion, appointing me Lieutenant Governor of Minorca, may be read.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>The Commission, appointing Sir</HI> WILLIAM DRAPER <HI>Lieutenant Governor of the Island of</HI> Minorca, <HI>dated</HI> May 3, 1779, <HI>was read by the</HI> JUDGE ADVOCATE.]</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Sir</HI> WILLIAM DRAPER <HI>sworn.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The day preceding the order complained of, having ob∣served a large three-masted vessel of the Enemy brought down to a Cove near George Town, I ordered the Com∣manding Officer of Artillery, who commanded in the Queen's Redoubt, to apply for some shells in order to try to sink her; they were brought, and applied accordingly: the vessel was sunk in consequence; about fourteen shells sent her to the bottom, with all her contents. It was known soon af∣terwards that she had twenty-four pieces of cannon on board, besides many other implements of war. Upon my return to the Castle from that service, I met Gen. Murray upon the Horn-work, he said he believed the vessel was sunk; I answered, I hope so. The next day the order of the 15th was issued. By that order I was deprived of a discre∣tionary power to fire a gun, unless by leave obtained from the Commanding Officer of the Artillery; although this very order was afterwards privately re∣voked in favour of two Captains, who were acting immediately in my depart∣ment; which made me conceive the af∣front to me more pointed and personal to me; I complained to the Adjutant Gene∣ral, Capt. Don, of the injury done me, and told him I must certainly bring the affair before a General Court Martial. Capt. Don informed Gen. Murray of this; but Gen. Murray would not re∣voke the order, and the General told me so by letter. I beg Capt. Donne may be called.</P>
</SP>

<P>In respect to the order, we are to understand it to be the same the Court are in possession of.</P>

<P>Whether the order was revoked, with regard to me, upon my complaint?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; it continued in force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you ever saw any thing in my conduct that made me deserving of such an order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard Sir William Draper express, at times, things that he was dissatisfied with of General Murray, and reprobated his conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The question is, Did you ob∣serve any thing prior to that in Sir Wil∣liam <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raper's conduct, which made him deserving of such an order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that that order was pointed particularly to Sir William Draper; it was a general order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It comprehended me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and so it did the whole Garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I had not, a very few days before, given you my earnest advice as to a position the Ge∣neral wished to have taken on Turk's-Mount side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper did. On the 9th or 10th of October, Gen. Murray and myself reconnoitred the ground between the mouth of St. Stephen's Cove and Turk's Mount. At that time, Gen. Murray was of opinion that the Ene∣my's battery, which they were con∣structing beyond Turk's Mount, might be annoyed by stone mortars, made in the rocks near the mouth of St. Ste∣phen's Cove; in consequence of which, he intended next morning to send a party of Miners to make these mortars, and a detachment to cover the working party; the position that this detach∣ment was to take, he pointed out to me. On the evening of the same day, General Murray desired me to wait up∣on Sir William Draper, and to com∣municate to him his intention relative to this business, and to request that he would superintend the execution of it. Sir William Draper then told me, that he doubted very much of the utility of the mortars in question, and that he thought the enterprise dangerous with respect to the covering party; but that the next morning, before day-break, he (Sir William) would examine the ground, which he did, and was still of the same opinion which he enter∣tained the preceding evening; all which was communicated to the Governor, and the whole of that enterprise dropp'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I did not give you my best advice with regard to the enterprise at Cape Mola?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg Sir William Draper to specify some time or place; for I don't immediately recollect it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When I spoke to you on the Horn-work, the evening preceding the attack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>On the evening of the 10th of October, General Murray and Sir Wil∣liam Draper were together on the Cur∣tain, between the two Horn-works; they continued in conversation for some time, and frequently pointed at Cape Mola: (I don't know what the con∣versation was:) after which they parted, and I think Sir William Draper turned to me, (but in this I am not positive)
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>and said that the way to cut off the Enemy's parties.....</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you positive that Sir William Draper said that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot answer that positively; I remember he turn'd about to me, and he said something about the Enemy's parties and Cape Mola: but what it was I cannot recall to my recollection; for it was a thing of a moment; and, I am sure, not of the least consequence at the time; for it has made no im∣pression on my memory: and if he had said any thing material, I cer∣tainly should have recollected it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I only wished to ask that, to convince every body I had done to the utmost of my power upon every occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Don.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't recollect that he gave me any advice of any impor∣tance, it having made no impression upon my memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether a general order does not comprehend all indi∣viduals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It certainly does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You said you look'd upon that order, of the 15th of October, to be a general order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know any thing that gave occasion to that order of the 15th?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do. The Governor had fre∣quently perceived that the young Of∣ficers of Artillery had fired at small par∣ties of the Enemy in relieving their posts and sentries, at the distance from nine hundred to a thousand yards from the Garrison, and likewise at small, lit∣tle breast-works, partially raised to co∣ver the sentries, and even at a few men without arms: he said he judged this firing to be ineffectual, and that it only tended to accustom the Enemy's troops to fire, and give them courage. The General said, at that time, that the Ene∣my's army he considered as raw and un∣disciplined, and therefore that it was not our business to make them brave by firing at them at a distance. The Ge∣neral mentioned several other circum∣stances, which I do not recollect. The General talked much upon this subject, and frequently in my hearing repri∣manded the Artillery Officers upon that subject. Upon this he founded the order, but I was not present when the order was issued. One of his motives was with respect to the ammunition; he said it was wantonly or uselessly ex∣pended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether the Ene∣my's troops work most under fire, or when there is no fire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly they work most when there is no fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I had made any wanton use of my command, in firing wantonly or injudiciously?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that I ever observed it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever ob∣serve any marks of insanity in me? I have a reason for asking that question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose Sir William Draper means, have I, since I have had the ho∣nour to be acquainted with him, seen any marks of madness about him: As to inconsistency of conduct—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have you seen any marks of insanity about me, that would unfit me for my duty as an Officer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have never discovered any marks of insanity in Sir William's be∣haviour since I have had the honour to know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether Sir William Draper patiently heard the whole mes∣sage
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>out, which I sent to him the even∣ing of the 11th of November?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He did not; he stopped me be∣fore I had finished it, as appears by what you have already read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I desire Capt. Don may repeat to the Court every word which Sir William Draper said upon that occasion, which he desired him to communicate to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The minute we have was taken down at the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Don.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When I returned with the message, the General wrote a letter to Sir William Draper, and inclosed that minute in it. I wrote down Sir William Draper's message before I saw the General; and I then delivered it to Gen. Murray, and said, There is an answer from Sir William. The General immediately called for a pen and ink, and said he would write to Sir William on the subject; and he wrote either that night or next morning to Sir Wil∣liam, and sent that paper inclosed in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The General wishes you would inform the Court of any thing that passed, besides what you have written down upon that paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are desired by Gen. Murray to repeat to the Court every word Sir William said to you at that time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Draper reprobated Gen. Murray's conduct in very harsh terms during that conversation. I thought it unnecessary to communicate that conversation to Gen. Murray, or any person; which I never have done. I thought it would have created an opener breach than there then was be∣tween the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, and that it was my duty to conceal it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This order was upon the 15th of October; and this is an <HI>ex post facto</HI> business; this is upon the 11th of November. Supposing the order im∣proper, it could not arise from any thing subsequent to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly would have revoked the order, when I found it displeasing to Sir William, had it not been for the harsh terms in which he expressed himself of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But the Witness says, he never communicated that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never mentioned to any man what passed between Sir William and me, but what I have wrote down upon that paper: Sir William was excessively warm at that time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>That was matter of common conversation. I have heard it said, that it was owing to that circumstance that happened the day before; and the rea∣son why it appeared to me so is, that it stands in the order, not only not to fire cannon; but any piece of ordnance, which seemed to advert to the shells.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When Gen. Murray had read the opinion of the Council of War, he expressed a very anxious desire to know what Sir William Draper's opi∣nion would be of their ideas. I told him, that, from the critical situation of things that day, I thought that Sir William Draper would not reasonably object to them. Gen. Murray replied, "Did he ever tell you so?" I said, <Q>“Sir, since you are so anxious upon this subject, I will venture to tell you, in confidence, Sir William has ”said something like this.</Q> The Ge∣neral still seeming anxious to be fur∣ther informed, I got up and shut the door, and said to him, <Q>Sir, as I think “this is a matter of great importance to the King's service, to your ho∣nour, and that of the garrison, you should have every information in my power to give you: I will therefore go further, and, confiding in you as a man of honour, who will not be∣tray me, I take upon me to show you some loose sentiments of Sir William Draper's upon this subject, upon pa∣per, ”which I have in my pocket.</Q>—Upon Gen. Murray's promising me solemnly, upon his honour, that no person whatever should know it, I showed him the paper.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because you said that it was confided in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The contents of that paper is no secret now, because it was known to every body soon after I returned the paper to Sir William Draper. I took no copy of it; therefore I can't repeat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not the paper ad∣vise, to propose to the Duc de Crillon a Cessation of Arms for a limited time, and to capitulate upon honourable terms, in case no succours arrived du∣ring that limited term?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The paper advised nothing; it contained some ideas relative to that subject, upon some certain suppositions. One day, when I entered Sir William Draper's room, he had several papers on his table relative to the siege, pro∣posing different sorts of methods that would conduce to the King's service, considering the situation Great-Britain was in at that period: one of them, I think, was, whether it would not be more conducive to the interests of England to risk an assault, and of the being prisoners at discretion; as an assault was an event which at that par∣ticular period might be reasonably sup∣posed to happen soon. Sir William had put down upon a piece of paper other ideas, different from this. Sir William
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>Draper said to me, <Q>Col. Pringle, “though Gen. Murray has treated me in such a manner that I think he does not deserve that I should furnish him with any ideas to get him out of this scrape which he has got into, yet, as the King's service, and all our honours, are concerned, I have been throwing some thoughts toge∣ther upon the state that we are in; which, as I may happen to be knocked on the head or killed, you may take ”and read.</Q> I did so; and, when I had read them, Sir William Draper said, <Q>You may put that paper into “”your pocket, and think of it.</Q> He gave me no authority to show it to any person, or to talk to any person; and I never did show it to any person but to Gen. Murray.</P>

<P>It was something to the purpose of what Gen. Murray has said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gen. Pringle's answer is, that the paper did not advise any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was a thing for consideration, upon certain suppositions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you told me, that, if I would agree to the opinion of that first Council of War, you would deliver up to me that paper, by Sir William Draper's consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not: but some days after, Gen. Murray and his Aid-de-Camp came to my apartment, in the Subter∣raneans, about two o'clock in the morning. He asked me <Q>to let him “”see the paper again,</Q> and seemed very anxious that I should deliver it up to him. I told him <Q>I was afraid I “had already done too much, and could not give that paper up with∣out Sir William Draper's consent; that I was persuaded Sir William Draper had no ideas that he would be afraid or ashamed to avow, and that he might send to him for that paper or another; and that I believed ”Sir William would give it him.</Q> I told Sir William Draper what I had done; who said to me, <Q>Colonel, “though you meant well in what you have done, yet you will find Gen. ”Murray will make a bad use of it.</Q> He took the paper from me, saying, <Q>“You shall not have it; I will not ”trust him.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you did not say that night, before Capt. Don, when we went into your quarters, <Q>that “you were very sure Sir William Draper would give up the paper, if I would consent to the opinion of ”that Council of War?</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I said, <Q>I was pretty sure that “Sir William Draper would give the ”paper, if he was asked for it:</Q> but I am almost certain that no such con∣dition was annexed, of Gen. Murray's consenting to the Council of War; and my reason for being pretty sure it was so, is, that before this period the opinion of the Council of War had been objected to, and the affair was decided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it not in my power, at that time, still to have as∣sented to the opinion of the Council of War?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly: it was the opinion of that Council for him to put them in execution whenever he thought proper; but he had decidedly rejected them before. He was left sole master of putting them into execution, or not, and of the time; and that, by their order, I told him, when I went to him with Gen. De Sidow with it.</P>

<P>The garrison was all under arms at night, expecting an assault; that was, I think, the 13th of January; and this was the day after.

<HEAD>DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lieut. Gen. <HI>MURRAY</HI> delivered into Court the following Paper; which was read by the <HI>JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Court has already heard my reasons for issuing my order of the 15th of October. I certainly did not mean to aggrieve Sir William Draper by that order. If he conceived it in that light, it was his duty to have stated it to me in a respectful manner; and I should certainly have altered it so, as to have given satisfaction to him. On the contrary, I never heard that this order had given the least offence to the Lieu∣tenant Governor, until the 11th of No∣vember, when I sent a message by Capt. Don, which has been stated in evidence. The contempt with which that message was received, and the irregular behaviour of Sir William Draper upon the occa∣sion, made me write the letter of the 12th of November, which has been produced, together with Sir William's answer. After this behaviour, it was impossible for me, without diminishing my authority, to retract or alter the or∣der in question, which was strictly mi∣litary. I shall, by my correspondence, prove that it was at all times my inclina∣tion to satisfy even the jealousies of Sir William Draper; and that my instruc∣tions were to the Officers of my family to keep us well together, by every at∣tention to him. It appears, by sub∣sequent letters which passed between us, that the ideas of Sir William Draper and myself, concerning our respective authorities, are very different indeed. Which of us is right, the Court must determine, and they will from thence judge where the probable cause of dif∣ference lay. It was impossible for the Lieutenant Governor to entertain any respect for me as a man, from the charges he has exhibited against me. If he saw them in the same light when the trans∣actions were fresh in his memory, as he has since represented them to his Ma∣jesty, I apprehend that those unjust sus∣picions, which I have severally disproved, may have so wrought on the mind of Sir William Draper, as to induce him to forget the relative situation between us, and sink, in his contempt for me, the respect he owed to his Governor.</P>
<P>At all times, but more especially in a Town besieged, the command of a Go∣vernor in a military fortress is absolute; and the inferior Officers are not only bound to obey his orders punctually; but they are to do so with chearfulness, and without shewing discontent them∣selves, or generating discontent in others. On the other hand, a Governor is cer∣tainly accountable for the due exercise of his authority. I declare to this Court, as a man of honour, that if Sir William Draper had accused me of murder, I should not have been more surprised than at the reason assigned by him and Col. Pringle for issuing that order, name∣ly, the skill or good luck of Sir Wil∣liam Draper in sinking a vessel, by a shell, the day before the order was is∣sued. I do declare I never heard of it 'till it appeared in Court; and I am ut∣terly at a loss to conceive how such an opinion could possibly be formed, or any such report prevail in the Garrison, where the truth of any circumstance of that kind was so easily discovered; when it was proved by Major Walton, that the vessel in question was sunk by shells in consequence of his order.</P>

</SP>
<P>Sir George Howard, I have finish∣ed this head, I will now take the three last Articles together.</P>
<TRAILER>END <HI>of the</HI> EVIDENCE <HI>to this</HI> ARTICLE.</TRAILER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DEFENCE to the remaining ARTICLES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Lieut. Gen.</HI> MURRAY <HI>delivered into Court the following Paper, which was read by the</HI> JUDGE-ADVOCATE.</P>
<P>THESE three Articles I must consider together, as the evidence to be pro∣duced upon each refers to the whole; and they are by that, and all the other circumstances attending them, compli∣cated with each other.</P>
<P>I do not conceive on what circumstance Sir William Draper founds this first part of these Articles, namely, <Q>that of “charging him (Sir William Draper) with an attempt to take the command ”from the Governor.</Q></P>
<P>In my letter to Sir William Draper, of the 16th of January, where I was rea∣soning upon a species of protest he had sent to me, in his first letter of the same date, against certain dispositions, which I had thought fit and necessary for our situation; (after stating my reasoning in answer to Sir William Draper on the subject) <Q>I say every attempt to take “the command from me will be inef∣fectual.”</Q> By this sentence, it is evi∣dent I do not charge Sir William with an actual; direct attempt to take the com∣mand from me: but I fairly insinuate, that I think there appears a tendency to abridge my authority; and I therefore declare, by a proper warning, that all such attempts will prove vain, and have no effect. And the subsequent letter of Sir William Draper to me, dated also the 16th of January, will sufficiently shew that, with regard to the said ten∣dency
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>and disposition, I did not judge amiss; for I humbly apprehend this second letter is a real attempt to a∣bridge my authority. But of all those matters, the evidence being in wri∣ting, the Court must judge from the correspondence between the Accuser and the Governor. As to superseding the Lieutenant-Governor without suf∣ficient cause; this, likewise, the Court will be enabled to judge of by the best evidence possible, that of our letters at the time.—The truth is, Sir William Draper superseded himself, by a con∣duct not only unmilitary, but fretful and capricious.—The extreme conceit of his own talents made him believe they placed him above the King's com∣mission; and, though I am ready to admit he has very considerable parts, yet I as freely confess they never struck me as sufficient to admit any superio∣rity on a military subject, even if we had been placed as equals, and much less so where the responsibility lay with me as Governor,—being confirmed in a belief that I was at all times fully justified in the discharge of my duty, if I acted to the utmost of my own ability and judgement, without being forced to ask the advice of other Offi∣cers, unless I should fee it proper so to do; and that every attempt to oblige me to call a Council of War was con∣trary to good discipline.—I do not deny, that Councils of War are of∣ten proper and advantageous; but they can only be so when they are as∣sembled at the spontaneous desire of the Commander in Chief.—The con∣trary doctrine is maintained by Sir William Draper:—And this is a point of difference between us, on which the Court will determine.</P>
<P>The last charge is artfully put. I can neither admit nor deny the fact as it is stated: I cannot allow that ever I said, that Sir William Draper advised me to surrender the place sooner than I did; but I aver and affirm this, that Sir William Draper, then Lieutenant-Governor of Minorca, residing in the Fortress of St. Philip's, then besieged by an Army under the Duc de Crillon, of which Fortress James Murray was Governor, did deliver a paper to Col. Pringle, then an Officer in the Gar∣rison, dated the 14th of January, 1782, purporting to be the opinion of the said Sir William Draper, That, consi∣dering the weak state of the Garrison, and the great force of the Enemy, it were better to send and propose a Cessation of Hostilities to the Duc de Crillon, and to make conditional terms of surrender at a certain time, if no relief should ar∣rive before the period agreed upon; the contents of which said paper were circulated in the Garrison, and stated as the advice of Sir William Draper to a Council of War assembled the 18th day of January by my order, and was the occasion of inducing some of the Officers who composed the said Coun∣cil of War to sign another paper, gi∣ving the said advice to me of propo∣sing a Cessation of Hostilities, and a conditional surrender to the Duc de Crillon.—This is all I ever asserted on the subject, and these facts I am ready to prove. The fair, just, and obvious inference to be drawn from them, I maintain, is, that Sir William Draper, Knight of the Bath, Lieutenant-Ge∣neral of his Majesty's Forces, and Lieu∣tenant-Governor of Minorca, was for agreeing on Terms of Capitulation sooner than I did; which must have produced the final surrender of the Fort before the period when I submitted,
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>even under the sickness which after∣wards prevailed among the Troops: and nevertheless this subsequent surren∣der by me, under those unforeseen ca∣lamities, and sanctified by the unani∣mous opinion of all the principal Offi∣cers, is stated as a heavy charge of cri∣minal accusation by the very man who first started and afterwards propagated the opinion among the principal Offi∣cers under my command, that we ought to have asked for a Cessation of Hosti∣lities, and conditional Terms of Capi∣tulation, from the Duc de Crillon, twenty days before we surrendered.</P>
<P>It may be said, that Sir William Draper, on proposing the conditional article respecting the relief, would have asked for a longer period than passed between the proposal and my surren∣der; but the history of Forts and Towns when besieged and beginning to parley, and the situation of our Garrison and that of the Enemy, will enable the Court to judge whether it is possible to believe, from the nature of the case, we could have obtained above ten days. I declare that the ut∣most time I ever heard mentioned, at the moment the advice was given to me, when I censured the opinion in my letter to the Officers of the Coun∣cil of War, was fourteen days.</P>
<P>The best way of defending a Gar∣rison is never to think, much less to talk, of surrendering it, until circum∣stances make it absolutely necessary; and the least suspicion of a con∣trary conduct is of the worst conse∣sequences: and upon this point the Court will judge between me and the advice I received from the Council of War promoted by Col. Pringle upon the opinion of Sir William Draper, whether my conduct, or following their opinion, would have been most beco∣ming the character of an old Soldier, and the honour of his Majesty's arms.</P>

<P>Did I desire you to accompany me, on the 19th of January, 1782, to Col. Pringle's apartment, at the Carolina?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; on the morning of that day, between two and three o'clock, I went with the General. We found Col. Pringle in his apartment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ask him for a paper written by Sir William Draper, which he, Col. Pringle, had shewn me the preceding evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did I, or did I not, ask Col. Pringle at what time he had received that paper from Sir William Draper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The General did; and Col. Pringle answered, on the 14th of Ja∣nuary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any conversation pass between Col. Pringle and me, about that paper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A long conversation ensued upon the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you gather, from the conversation, what the contents of the paper were?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Partly I did: it appeared to me, that the paper contained Sir Wil∣liam Draper's ideas of the situation of the fortress, and the state of the garri∣son; and, from the reduced state of both, that he, Sir William Draper, was of opinion, that the Governor should immediately propose to the Duc de Crillon a cessation of arms for a fixed period, at the expiration of which the garrison should capitulate upon the best terms that we could get.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I desired Col. Pringle to wait upon Sir William Draper, and endeavour to obtain his permission to put the paper in question into my possession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Gen. Murray did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What answer did Col. Pringle make to that request?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He said he would wait upon Sir William Draper in the forenoon, and communicate Gen. Murray's re∣quest to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know whether Col. Pringle did wait upon Sir William Draper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he did; because he returned that forenoon to Gen. Murray. He went into Gen. Murray's private apartment. After Col. Pringle was gone, Gen. Murray said to me, "Col. Pringle has waited upon Sir William Draper, to request the paper may be put into my possession:" and he said the answer was, "Sir William Draper had no objection to put the paper into Gen. Murray's hands, provided he would carry the measure therein sug∣gested into immediate execution."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether you have seen the questions Gen. Murray pro∣posed, before you came into the Court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He certainly did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is that usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Judge-Advocate.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If the question is unexceptionable, I don't know that there is any harm in informing a Wit∣ness, that he is to be examined to this or that point; but if the question be a
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>leading one, then it is improper for the Witness to see it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. <HI>Don.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I knew the points I was to be examined upon, but I never told Gen. Murray what my answers would be</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were the questions which have been proposed to you, previously concerted between you and Gen. Murray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly Gen. Murray ac∣quainted me that he would examine me to those points; and I saw the questions previous to coming into Court. I understood it was legal, for the opinion of the lawyers had been asked upon that subject; they said it was, but by no means that we should tell Gen. Murray what our answers would be: and therefore, without hesitation, I read the questions over and over again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But were the questions con∣certed between you and Gen. Murray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: Gen. Murray asked me if those questions were proper to the point; and they were framed to the point in question by Gen. Murray and me. I had minutes of the whole transaction taken down at the moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was an affi∣davit made by Capt. Don before the Judge-Advocate, in the Fort, relative to this business: I asked a Counsel if that affidavit could be received in evi∣dence, in this Court: he said, No, but we must frame the questions so as to bring before the Court the substance of that affidavit. The questions were framed accordingly; and I have here the affidavit, if the Court wish to see it. I saw my reputation was at stake, and I therefore took these precautions to authenticate the fact, in case either of us died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought Gen. Murray told us in this business he had no professional aid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have no professional aid in this business: I asked Mr. Er∣skine that simple question; and as to any aid in my defence, my style is pretty well known in the world, they may judge whether it is mine or not: I did not ask any of Sir William Dra∣per's Witnesses if they had seen any of the questions they were to answer.— Witnesses should, in my opinion, know what questions will be proposed, before they come into Court; otherwise I have seen instances where they are over-awed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>W. Draper.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It shews plainly that the paper never was meant for Gen. Murray, because I never trusted him with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Murray.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had it in my hand.—Such a paper as that, I, as Governor, had a right to keep; and if I had done my duty, I should have put you in arrest: I ask pardon of my King and Country for not doing it, which was the greatest crime I committed.</P>

<HEAD>CORRESPONDENCE <HI>between Lieut. Gen.</HI> MURRAY <HI>and Sir</HI> WILLIAM DRAPER.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>From Gen.</HI> Murray <HI>to Sir</HI> William Draper, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25, 1781.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the Enemy's proceedings hitherto, it may be imagined they do not mean to attack the place by regular approaches; in∣deed, as they may destroy our defences without any great risque to themselves, and that there is not the least appearance of any attempt to avail themselves of the advantages they possess to erect batteries for that purpose, it may be supposed their intention is to assault and take the place by surprise; of course, our first at∣tention should be to provide against such an insult. The vicinity of the Governor's Bar∣ranca, and the little protection from the works we can give to the Glacis and Outward Covered Way betwixt the S. W. Lunette and the Caro∣lina, must encourage an attack from that quar∣ter; I mean, from the Governor's Barranca. <HI>Query,</HI> What can now be contrived, in addition to what is already done, to secure us there? Would a Grasshopper or two placed on the West face of the Outward Covered Way, to fire upon the column of attack, which naturally would march upon the produced capital of the Carolina, assist? Would another be useful, in annoying this attack, if placed in the S. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the Ca∣rolina? And, for a further protection to the Carolina, would another be well posted in the S. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the West Lunette? Will one in the N. W. face of the Outward Covered Way of the West Lunette, to fire on the capital of the Kane, be of utility?</P>
<P>As the Enemy, if they intend to carry the place by a general assault, will necessarily push at our vitals, they will vigorously attack the Inner Covered Way at the same instant they attack the Outward one and the Lunettes. Our inferior numbers invite them to embrace this idea. May not the Inner Covered Way be strengthened by the remaining Grasshoppers? I mean, those not posted in the Lunettes; for certainly these cannot be placed to greater ad∣vantage than where they are. I judge it would be more difficult to push into the body of the place, covered by the Kane, Queen, and An∣struther, than by the attack upon the English line; but I think a push made betwixt the West Lunette and the Kane should be provided against as much as possible; the arch-way under the new work should be blocked up without delay. Will it be proper to erect a breast-work of bar∣rels, filled with earth, high enough to protect the men employed in managing the Grasshop∣pers in the circular Barbet battery, in the rear of the Kane; or will a Barbet gun there answer the purpose as well?</P>
<P>The Sea Line is defended only by the flank∣ing guns on that line; the guard, &amp;c. at the new place of arms, which, with the piquet, will consist of only eighty-two musqueteers, ten of which are sentries, who, in case of a general alarm, must stick to their posts, can afford no protection to that line, but the fire from the place of arms. Can any thing be thought of for the better security of that line? If any guards of musqueteers are judged neces∣sary, they must be composed of the seamen taken from the batteries in the Castle, the Country-wards, and Ravelines; which batteries cannot be allowed to act, in the supposition of a night-attack upon the outward line. Charles-Fort, in the present supposition, although a Becoyeu, will be of great utility, when the block-house to be made at the corn-store on the Cumberland is finished, which I wish to be done as soon as possible, together with the block-house and pal∣lisading at the top of the Burying-ground: we are as secure there as our number will allow us to be; at least, I can think of nothing we can do, at this time, to make us more so; nor can I suggest any further security for the Sea Line, towards St. Stephen's Cove, betwixt Charles-Fort
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>and the South Lunette; which South Lu∣nette must take especial and obstinate care of itself, in the supposed case: luckily the under∣ground communications from it to the body of the place are well mined, and may be easily defended.</P>
<P>There are thirteen six-pounder carronades, and three of eighteen pounds. <HI>Query,</HI> May not they be properly employed in strengthening the Sea Line, or the Inner Covered Way, or some of them placed so as to act in the salient angles of the Redoubts and Counter-guards? N. B. If it is judged expedient to place any of the Grasshoppers in the Outward Covered Way, they may, in case of an alarm, be manned by the sentries in the Outward Covered Way, and a detachment of Artillery from the Lunettes, or rather as many of that corps as may be ne∣cessary for them, to be posted in the Lunettes every night, that there may be no diminution from the strength of the guns in the Lunette.</P>
<P><HI>Query,</HI> If the two Grasshoppers proposed to be placed so as to play upon the produced capitals of the S. W. and Caroline Lunettes, were put in the Old Covered Way, betwixt these two Lunettes, would such a position an∣swer the purpose?</P>
<P>Capt. Lawson, with a reinforcement to the Monarca's crew, will take the Guards in the Castle and subterranean communications from the main ditch; he says, he can be answerable for them: indeed, I think he may; as seamen are accustomed to the idea of being put to close quarters, and of defending them.</P>
<P>It would be very proper, if every Officer in the garrison was instructed what he is to do in every contingent event. Those appointed for shutting the doors, and putting out the lamp, in the communications, should be named, and should every night lie on their posts, with the men appointed for that parti∣cular duty; who, no doubt, will be trusty in∣valids, equal to perform it. If prudence would admit to exercise the regiments in taking up their posts, and altering their position as cir∣cumstances might happen, it would be right to do it; but the desertions which have happened, and the prospect of more, forbid that idea, lest the Enemy should know our resources.</P>
<P>Capt. Mayne, I am confident, may be relied on; his part in the supposed scene is an active and most essential one: indeed, our present si∣tuation requires all the vigilance, patience, and fortitude, of every one of us. Two traverses are proposed by Col. Brewse, to be (as I sup∣pose) defended by musquetry; but, alas! we have not musqueteers to defend more essential objects.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>Sir</HI> William Draper<HI>'s Answer, Sept.</HI> 25, 1781.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have been pleased to give me your paper to consider upon, I take this liberty to acquaint you, that I do not think it neces∣sary to place any more Grasshoppers in the Out∣ward Covered Way, judging that the number in the several Lunettes is fully sufficient to de∣fend the Glacis, and the Covered Ways respec∣tively flanked by them. I am of your opinion, that the remainder may be very properly dis∣posed of in the Inner Covered Way, and so placed as to play in the Enemy's columns, should a desperate attempt be made to rush in between the several Lunettes, and to force our places of arms. The artillery of the inner works seems to me of very little service in <HI>night</HI> attacks, especially if the Enemy can join our troops stationed in the Inner Covered Way and places of arms; therefore the Grasshoppers in the Inner Covered Way may be the preserva∣tion of the place, by their repeated discharges on the advancing Grenadiers.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that a very useful stockade may be planted between the S. W. Lunette and Caroline; as the distance between their ditches is little more than fifty yards: the old tough ship-timber is more difficult to cut through than the pallisades, and I believe there is a very sufficient quantity for the above-mentioned pur∣pose. Your observations on the parts by which an Enemy might penetrate, seem perfectly just; but I think the Enemy's push between the Kane and West Lunette ably and greatly provided against by the new work. As an additional se∣curity, three Grasshoppers may be placed in the Inner Covered Way, and in the right face of the West Counter-guard; and, as the Inner Covered Way on the side is so much higher than the Outward, it will command and scour all the Glacis on the left face of the Kane; and the Grasshopper and three guns in the new work will effectually rake the Glacis and Co∣vered Way on the right face of the West Lu∣nette. I am of opinion, likewise, that the carronades may be brought into good use, for an additional Defence of the Sea Line. I think your ideas and projects, for the defence of the subterreins, perfectly just; and will do all in my power to carry them into execution.</P>

<P>SIR William Draper presents his re∣spects to the Governor, and begs the favour to be informed, what his <HI>definition</HI> of the <HI>Out-line</HI> is; Sir William Draper thought it compre∣hended the out-works in general: on that sup∣position, as he was charged with the <HI>defence,</HI> he imagined some traverses in the Covered Way necessary for that purpose.

<LETTER>
<P>LIEUT. GEN. Murray presents his respects to Sir William Draper; he means, by the Out-line, all the defences beyond the In∣ner Covered Way, viz. Lunettes, Mines, Fou∣gasses, Stone Mortars, &amp;c. Sir William's de∣finition of the Out-works comprehends the whole of this Fortification, which consists only of Out-works, inner and outward, with regard to the old Castle; of course, Sir William must have imagined Gen. Murray had divested him∣self of the command of the place, from a con∣sciousness in himself, which is by no means the case. He certainly did, when he left the Fort last summer, beg of Sir William Draper to put the place in the best state of defence he could, and to endeavour to execute what had been projected betwixt Sir William and himself. Lieut. Gen. Murray will for ever think him∣self obliged to Sir William for his exertions; he would be happy now to be assisted with his advice, as would likewise the Chief Engineer; but 'tis uncommon for a Governor to have works carrying on, when he is present upon the spot, without his knowledge. Lieut. Gen. Murray would have been much obliged to Sir William Draper, if he had explained to him the utility of the traverse in question; which, at this moment, neither he nor the Chief En∣gineer can see: but they see it would impede a gun, which was placed in the new work, for the defence of that branch of the Covered Way, and of course a great protection to the guard in the place of arms, which Sir William so ably projected for the defence of the stairs lead∣ing from thence to the ditch of the N. W. O. Ravelin. They think the carronade to be fixed in the pallisades of the Covered Way, where the traverse was to have been made, will be a better protection to the frieze of the new work, than the few men which might have been posted there for the purpose with their musquets.</P>

<P>THE Governor presents his respects to Sir William Draper, and begs he will let him know the number of Officers and Men, exclusive of the Artillery and Seamen, which he thinks are necessary for the defence of the out∣line, and the subterranean passages from it to the inner works; that a disposition of the re∣mainder may be made for the defence of the Inner Covered Way.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>SIR William Draper presents his best respects to his Excellency; and, in answer to his question, takes the liberty to inform him, that he judges fifty for the South Lunette, sixty for the S. W. forty for the Carolina, and sixty for the West Lunette, a very sufficient number for the purposes he mentions: he is not for risquing a greater proportion, lest the remainder of the garrison should be too much weakened. At the South Lunette is unconnected with the others, he thinks a Captain and fifty necessary there. As the subterraneans of the South-West, and West, in some measure protect those of the Carolina, he gives more to them than to that work. The circumstances of the defence must depend so much upon the nature of the Ene∣my's attack, that it is very difficult to be pre∣cise upon the subject: if the formality of a siege takes place, and a breach be made in any of the Lunettes, he presumes, that if a deter∣mination is made to defend it, the number must vary accordingly. Against a <HI>coup de main</HI> only, he is not for risking more than he has mentioned on the out-line, &amp;c. He judges a Captain necessary for the South-West, and also the West; and an old Lieutenant for the Carolina: the other Officers in the usual proportion; and one Field-Officer to the three Lunettes which are connected together. He thinks the Pantoon intrenchment and the Hospital Line can only be defended from the works which respectively command them.</P>

<P><HI>Message sent from Gen.</HI> Murray <HI>to Sir</HI> William Draper, <HI>by Capt.</HI> Don, <HI>Adjutant-General, Nov.</HI> 11, 1781.</P>
<P>GEN. Murray presents his compli∣ments to Sir William Draper, and begs to know if he thought it proper that the two Ser∣jeants'-guards in the Outward Line, posted at St. Stephen's, and in the rear of the circular fascine battery, should be retired into the Inner Covered Way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Capt. Don had delivered the above message to Sir William as far as Covered Way, he stopped him, and said, "He was deprived of all command by the orders of the 15th of October; which was such an af∣front shewn to him, that he would insist on a General Court-Martial, to decide who was in the right or wrong in regard to that, as well as other things: That a Ge∣neral Officer on the Staff, and in his situation here, to be obliged to apply for permission to fire a gun, was a thing unheard of, and extremely insulting to him." He then mentioned something that had happened between him and a Captain of Artillery (meaning Capt. Fead), and in general terms expressed his being much hurt by the insults offered to him by Gen. Murray. He desired Capt. Don to communicate this to Gen. Murray, and then gave him to understand he had no further com∣mands.</NOTE>, and to furnish the sentries from thence for the Outward Covered Way.</P>

<P>IT gave me infinite concern to receive the inclosed to a message I had the honour to send to you yesterday by the Adjutant-General. I am very conscious I never had done any thing to give you offence. I told you, before, I would do all in my power to please you, but that of divesting myself of the command which his Majesty has been pleased to confer upon me. I gave you a very large share of it; and, for the sake of peace and harmony, which should subsist in the garrison, I did, and would have continued to, wink at the contempt and neg∣lect you have shewn, by never reporting to me the changes you have made, and the occur∣rences which have happened, in the department committed to your charge as Lieutenant-Go∣vernor. I judge the orders of the 15th of last month to be both proper and necessary; and therefore I cannot retract from them: I flatter myself a Board or Court-Martial, composed of General Officers, who alone can determine the point, will justify me. I heartily wish for a thorough investigation of it, from the first day of your arrival in Minorca. At present, it is necessary to know if it is your pleasure to act as Lieutenant-Governor of this garrison; be∣cause, if you will not, I must make my ar∣rangements accordingly.</P>

<P>COL. PRINGLE thinks the Garri∣son of the Marlborough needful to enable us to defend the other works; of course, that the Marlborough should be blown up. For my own part, I see a number of strong objections to this mode of reinforcement: it is true, we are very defective in fuzileers; but, as soon as our cannon are intirely silenced, we shall be reinforced, in our defences with small arms, with the Marine Corps, who, at least, may take all the labour, and leave every soldier to do the duty with arms. I never was obstinate, and therefore wish, if agreeable to you, to sub∣mit Col. Pringle's proposition relative to the Marlborough to your consideration and opi∣nion; and, if you think proper to consult with Gen. De Sydow, Col. De Linsing, Col. Ack∣lom, and Col. Brewse, upon it, I can have no objection. In the mean time, I think it ne∣cessary to remark, that we are not yet arrived to the proper stage of the siege to abandon the Marlborough intirely. If it shall be thought expedient to blow it up before we have disputed the possession of it with the Enemy, a smaller Garrison than the present may suffice; if you think so, I shall chearfully diminish it, to re∣inforce us on this side. If my ideas of the E∣nemy's intentions are well founded, I judge the Marlborough may be of great importance to us. My ideas are founded upon the intelli∣gence I have had, that the Duc de Crillon, from the apprehensions of his army, does not mean to storm this place, until by his miners he can render our defences below ground as feeble as he, with eighty-six pieces of cannon, and thirty-six mortars, can our defences above. The sap they are now pushing from the Water-Tower points out something like this.—It may be done with a view only of approaching us on that quarter, to set their miners to work: they are already too near from the Great Barranca and the Gallows. The Marlborough will give more annoyance on that side than the Argyll, Queen, and Anstruther, in the state they soon must be reduced to, can give from the Water-Tower. I candidly, Sir, give you my no∣tions, and will with confidence submit them to you, and the Officers I have mentioned, if
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>you judge it proper to assemble them; but, if you do not think such a parade necessary, I shall be very happy to have your own opi∣nion only, which I do assure you ever had, and ever will have, a very decisive weight with me.</P>

<P>IN answer to your Excellency's let∣ter, relative to the demolition of the Marlbo∣rough, I am humbly of opinion that such a step may be necessary in some ten days time: at present I think an immediate reduction of its Garrison very expedient, as our number on this side are greatly reduced by sickness, death, desertion, and the absence of eighty seamen. The Enemy's grand attack is so forcibly de∣clared on the Queen, the N. W. Outward Ra∣veline, and the North Horn-work, that there can be no doubt of their intention to penetrate through that front; and, from the condition these Works are already reduced to from a su∣perior fire, I think a general storm may be at∣tempted in a fortnight's time. It is also my opinion that the Enemy will not wait for the fatal effects of our great mines without the Queen and Kane; nor do I believe they will erect any Batteries on the crate of the Glacis of either work. I shall be very glad to find myself mistaken in my conjectures.</P>
<P>I think, Sir, that two companies of Prince Ernest's Regiment may be drawn back to the interior works on that side.</P>

<P>I THINK that the Covered Way immediately on the right of the place of arms, before the North Horn-work, is a better post than the place of arms itself; as there is room to act in; and the little post, where the two guns are placed, is a most excellent position to support it on the right. The guns in the lower part of the North Horn-work, which scours the Covered Way on the right of the N. W. Outward Raveline, are still serviceable, and ought to be manned, and used. The first post to be maintained, in my opinion, is the little place of arms in the rear of the Kane; whe∣ther the attack is made between the Kane and the West Lunette, or the Kane and the Queen's Redoubt, and Officer and twenty men should maintain that post; and the two Grasshoppers, the one in the traverse, and the other in the work itself, should be manned and used. There are several guns on the right face of the N. W. Outward Raveline in good condition for firing; the guns on the right flank of the Kane are perfectly good. Should the Enemy attempt to penetrate through the Kane and the Queen's, almost all the guns on the left of the works (that is) from the left face of the West to Charles Fort, have suffered very little, and, I am of opinion, should be fully prepared. If the Enemy attacks us seriously on this or any other night, his own fire of guns and mortars must cease, when several of our guns, although too feeble to resist his Batteries, may be used with grape to destroy his Troops when ap∣proaching to, or when in our Covered Way, or even places of arms: therefore I am by no means for placing the seamen in the subter∣reins; I think they will do us more service in being stationed in the places I have mentioned, to use the great guns, under their proper Offi∣cers, and the assistance of ours. I have no doubt but the Electoral Troops, aided by such able and brave Officers, will do their utmost for his Majesty's and their own glory:—they have studied their parts of the intended attack upon us. I do not presume to alter any thing but the little I have mentioned.</P>

<P>I Think, as you do, that every gun that can be fired must do its duty in case of an assault. They are all loaded with grape, and have the necessary supply of ammunition for such an event. Fire-balls, of both dimensions, are lodged in the advanced works. I wish to have guns left us to resist an attack. Surely no man can imagine our guns that act (all which I know perfectly well) are to be idle on such an occasion: they will be all stoutly manned, and well supplied, without the aid of the Sea Cap∣tains, appointed to the subterraneans.</P>
<P>I think, with regard to the Hanoverian dis∣position, that it is a very soldier-like one: it should not be altered, as they like it. Had I made it, there would have been more men in the Inner Covered Way, to retreat to the posts mentioned in their disposition, where I would have posted cool Officers and men to cover their retreat, as we have done in the British line. I do not think, that even the Inward Covered Way is to be, or can be, with our number, obstinately defended: the places of arms must. Three or four good and cool discharges may be made on the advancing Enemy, by all the men we can spare, after providing for the defence of the places of arms, and the interior works. This is the disposition of the interior British line, and I trust it will be executed with∣out risque or confusion.</P>

<P>I Assure you there never was an idea of taking a man from Charles Fort, Capt. Blakeney excepted. He, Capt. Harman and Crawford, with Capt. Hewison, were judged steady men to take the charge of the commu∣nication from the main ditch, and the necessary number of seamen, which could be spared from the interior silenced guns: but as it is with dif∣ficulty to get men enough for the guns we can still use on the defensive, I have left the sailors for the guns, but posted the Captains Harman, Hewison, and Crawford, in the communica∣tion. I wish I could give them seamen, and the poor battalions, to be as strong as possible.</P>
<P>I am afraid the Prince of Wales's Battery is no longer tenable. Destroyed as it is, an im∣mediate and too safe an atrack may be appre∣hended. If the troops posted there are attack∣ed, and obliged to retreat, the Enemy may fol∣low them pell-mell: the consequences would be unpleasant; indeed they might be no less than cutting off the communication with the Lunettes Will it not, therefore, be advise∣able to withdraw from thence, and take post in the N. W. outward raveline, and West counter∣guard? These places are repairable by cantoon-bunkets, and sand-bags, to heighten the para∣pets where most hurt. If this plan takes place, the communication to the bottom of the stair∣case must then be blocked up securely. I shall be very happy, Sir, to have your opinion of this matter. Boxes of grenades may be placed in the stair-case, and fired from a train below. I wish we may not soon be reduced to do this, or something like it, with all our stairs. It is to be lamented they were not all made bomb∣proof: but who could have imagined that 178 pieces of cannon, and forty-seven mortars, of the largest calibre, would have been brought to pulverise this wretched hole, defended by 1400 invalids, and 600 seamen and others? The Duc de Crillon, I think, may roar and pound with his artillery; he must use other instruments to reduce us to extremity. He is as superior to us in miners, as in weighty metal: I judge, for that reason, he will, when the weather per∣mits, endeavour to establish himself at Charles Fort and the Marlborough, and attach his miners on this side St. Stephen's Cove. This mode will be tedious, it is true; it is such a one that neither you nor I would probably have adopted, had we been in his situation; but he has raw troops, is not an oeconomist in ammu∣nition, and perhaps has orders not to risque a general assault. I candidly give you my notions of our situation, and am very confident, for the good of the service of our Master, and the ho∣nour
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>of the arms of our country, you will fa∣vour me with yours, which I once more assure you has great weight with me.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse told me yesterday, you wished to have the mines on the Glacis loaded: they were once so, but drawn again at the desire of Col. Brewse, who declared, if these mines were loaded, we were deprived from countermining the Enemy. If their plan was to attack us under ground, he said our mines could never be looked upon in any other light than Galleries de Coute; as they were too advanced from the crate of the Covered Way to overset the Ene∣my's batteries erected there. This is now out of the question; and I most chearfully consent to their being loaded, and fired when you think proper. I think, however, as I am told you do, that this will be an operation of <HI>éclat,</HI> ra∣ther than of utility. I have set on this day the miners to charge the mines in the subterranean communications. I dare say you will think it high time to push that necessary work: a few days will finish it: but if you are impatient to have the mines in the Outward Covered Way loaded, the company may be divided, and em∣ployed in both.</P>

<P>I Have had the honour of your letter; in answer to which, I take the liberty to in∣form you that I was ever, and am now, of an opinion that a Coupare should be made across the place of arms, called the Prince of Wales's Battery, to defend the approach to the draw∣bridge on the one fide, and the communication from below on the other. There are large bar∣rels in the N. N. W. Outward Raveline: these, at present, are all taken up to cover the mor∣tars in that work; but I think many of them may be spared, and with their contents form some defence for the place of arms. If nothing of this sort can be effected, the post is undoubt∣edly weak, for want of a ditch before it; which I have often lamented the want of, foreseeing the inconveniency; as also knowing that it would do little as a battery, and be totally ex∣posed to a most heavy fire, which would destroy all the palisades before it, as they were so un∣luckily placed. However, as things now are, we must look forward. If no defence is made in the spot, the Covered Way on the right and left of it must be abandoned likewise, because it depended on the place of arms for its <HI>flank fire,</HI> and a retreat, if its defenders were re∣pulsed: so that the whole front between the West Counter-guard, and N. W. Outward Ra∣veline, is laid bare of support but from these works only. I must own I think it is sacri∣ficing too much at once. All the Fougasses near it may certainly be loaded in the night, which will give it additional security. If it be thought absolutely necessary to abandon it, the stair-case must undoubtedly be taken away; but I must own, I am no friend to the boxes of grenades placed at the bottom, as an unfor∣tunate shell may do much mischief by their aid.</P>

<P>I Find, by your disposition, that the Inner Covered Way, and the places of arms which should be its protection, are to be given up, and the troops destined for its defence withdrawn. The resolution is very serious, and deserves attention; and, in my humble opinion, <HI>reconsideration;</HI> because, Sir, if the Inner Covered Way is given up, what fire is there to check the Enemy when advancing be∣tween the Lunettes, when they are attacked by their Gorges? These Lunettes must owe their preservation, if they are attacked, to the an∣noyance and loss the Enemy must sustain from the fire poured in from our Inner Covered Way. The miserable fire of ten or twelve men, sta∣tioned in the Gorges of the out-works, is of <HI>little moment;</HI> therefore, if the fire of the inner line is removed, all is lost. I should never, Sir, have thought myself equal to the defence of the outline, unless I had flattered myself with a certainty of support from the inner: that sup∣port being withdrawn, I confess myself une∣qual to the task, and by no means responsible.</P>

We have none now to work. In short, I will not, with so pitiful a handful of worn-out men, un∣dertake the defence of the Inner Covered Way, and give the Enemy an opportunity, or rather a certainty, of entering pell-mell into the body of the place, in pursuit of the few, although our all, who certainly cannot be supposed able to resist them long in the Inner Covered Way. To attempt this, would be having a short siege indeed: I mean it shall be a long one, which will do honour to the Troops, and the Officers commanding them.

<P>AT present, I have only to say, in answer to your last letter, that I am ignorant of any rule or usage, in the service, for a Com∣mander in Chief to call upon a Council of War, to make his disposition either of attack or defence. I have consulted most of the prin∣cipal Officers in the garrison with regard to our situation, and risquing the fate of the place upon the Inner Covered Way. Some are ten∣der in giving any opinion, saying it is beyond their depth and experience: others give it clearly as theirs, that the Covered Way should only be defended in part, as long as our communi∣cation with it can be preserved. I am of that opinion. As you decline the execution of the command I assigned to you, and will not obey your Governor, it is better for the service that you should be taken at your word. Such an ex∣ample of disrespect, and contempt of a Gover∣nor, is inexcusable at all times; in the present situation of affairs here, I think it cannot be justified; and therefore Col.

<P>GEN. De Sydow, the Colonels, Lieute∣nant-Colonels, the Chief and Second Engineers, and the Commanding Of∣ficer of Artillery (Lieutenant-Colonel Walton), are intreated by the Governor to consider what follows, and to give their opinions at large, in writing, upon every consideration Our situation is critical and nice, and the Governor wishes to take the advice of the principal Of∣ficers in the Garrison, which he is certain will be given candidly, and for the ho∣nour of his Majesty's arms.</P>
<P>IT must be allowed a maxim, without ex∣ception, That the longer a Garrison holds out, the more honour is due to that Garrison; it must of course follow, that nothing should be risqued by a small Garrison, well provided with every thing which contributes to shorten the siege. Large Garrisons may wish to in∣vite the Besiegers to enterprises, in the ex∣ecution of which they must lose many more men than the besieged: indeed, overgrown Garrisons, perhaps, should obstinately defend the Covered Way; although there is no in∣stance I know of where the Besiegers failed in the attack of the Covered Way. On the other hand, it is certain the assailants gene∣rally lose three times the number in the ob∣stinate defence of a Covered Way.</P>
<P>The question at present is, Whether our strength will admit of the obstinate defence of our Inward Covered Way, the retreat from which being by narrow stairs, and not many of them, and there being no men left in the Garrison to defend the Ditches and man the Ravelines, to protect and give time to recover the confusion of a night retreat of beaten troops, followed pell-mell into the vi∣tals of the place, is to be risqued? In the supposed case, in my poor opinion, the con∣sequence must be equally as disgraceful as fatal. The enemy are well acquainted with the passages from the Lunettes into the Ditches. At the very time they pursue the part of our baffled, feeble Garrison, which retreat from the Covered Way, they seize upon the defences we have made to cover the retreat of the troops from the Lunettes: this they will do with ease. So the defences for the pre∣servation of the retreat from the Lunettes must, without the loss of a man, become theirs, and the troops in the Lunettes surren∣der prisoners at discretion.</P>
<P>If the Inner Covered Way is defended partially by a sufficient number of men, to at∣tempt the defence of the <HI>Places d' Armes</HI> there, men for that purpose may be found, and the security of their retreat may be coolly secured by the men posted in the Ditches. But how precarious are our stairs from the <HI>Places d' Armes!</HI> one round of the enemy's mortars may, in half an hour, destroy them all but one, viz. that in the rear of the Kane.</P>
<P>The Governor has made a disposition of the troops, in case it should be judged expe∣dient to defend the Inner Covered Way par∣tially; it is laid before the above Officers for their consideration, and advice to improve it. It has been said, that there is little dependence in the defence of a Ditch from the flanking fire of four or eight Musquetoons; but when it is considered that the Enemy must, man by man, come by ladders only into the Ditch, our Grenadoes above will not be idle. Add to that, twenty men to charge them with their bayonets when attempting to form, these men will certainly succeed, and overset the ladders. The men employed in this part of the defence need run no risque from our grenadoes above: a signal below, either by fife or drum, may be settled to warn the troops above to cease or renew the throwing their grenades. It is to be considered, the descent into a Ditch, in the supposed case, is very different from that into a work attacked and filled almost up with the Breach made in the Scarp. In this case, the Enemy have every material necessary at hand, from the immediate vicinity of their approach, to fill up the Ditch: in the present supposed one, they must be brought from a great di∣stance by unarmed men, who probably will drop them, and throw the ladders likewise, as even our troops did at the attack of St. Lazar.</P>
<P>Those that are of opinion that the Inner Covered Way is to be defended obstinately, will consider our numbers, which indeed is not equal to manning or lining it; for there is an absolute necessity in that case to rein∣force our guard considerably within, for the protection of our magazines, and other pur∣poses. The worn-out feeble state of the Gar∣rison is a circumstance to be weighed, when it is expected men are to make a vigorous re∣sistance
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>in the defence of a wretched Covered Way at first, but particularly so now, from the Pallisades being destroyed, upon which the fate of the Garrison must instantly de∣pend. It may likewise be considered, that in this disposition of risquing all in the defence of the Inward Covered Way in question, we may, with justice, be accused of wanting that patience and firmness, which, by prolonging the siege, we shall have opportunities of ex∣hibiting. Courage is common almost to all men; patience, fortitude, and steadiness, dis∣tinguish the good soldier, and, I humbly judge, is the only mode we have to get honour and a good capitulation, when we are reduced to the utmost extremities.</P>
<P>The questions, therefore, are three.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. Are we to risque the fate of the place upon the obstinate defence, in as powerful a manner as we can, of the Inward Covered Way?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Are we to make a disposition, leaving only part in the Covered Way, such only as are necessary for the defence of the <HI>Places d' Armes</HI> for some time, who may do execu∣tion against the assaulting enemy, and coolly retreat without loss?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Are we to reinforce the Covered Way by more men than those proposed for the Places of Arms? If we are, what number is proposed by the Officers who shall be of that opinion?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Governor thinks it right, on this oc∣casion, to declare that his opinion is in favour of the second question, as long as the stairs and places of arms remain entire. When they are destroyed by the thundering artillery of the Enemy, which may reasonably be ex∣pected hourly, we have no alternative: the Covered Way in question must then be en∣tirely abandoned, except the Place of Arms at the salient angle of the North West Out∣ward Raveline: this should be guarded for a <HI>Sortie;</HI> it may be mined, so as to be blown up at any time, if we are obliged to abandon it.</P>
<P>The Governor wishes not only to have the advice and opinion of the Officers, of what has been mentioned above, but of every thing which may occur to them which they judge may be necessary, and may have escaped the attention of the Governor.</P>

<SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING considered your Excel∣lency's paper, addressed to us, with the que∣ries annexed, and also the enfeebled and har∣rassed state and condition of the Garrison, &amp;c. we are of the same opinion with your Ex∣cellency.</P>
<P>First, That the state of the Garrison is such, that we apprehend it could make but a feeble resistance in manning the whole of the Interior Covered Way.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we are of opinion a partial defence of the Inner Covered Way will not afford sufficient protection to the advanced works, nor prevent the Enemy from getting into the adjacent Ditch.</P>
<P>And therefore we think, that without a sufficient protection from the Inner Covered Way, the advanced works cannot long resist a serious attack; nor do we think, that the fire from the Inner Works, ruined as they are, would much impede or annoy an Enemy.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We are of opinion, that when the advanced works are forced, or the Enemy gets into the adjacent Ditch, by leaving these advanced works behind them unattacked, the retreat of the men in those works must be cut off, and the Fort probably soon obliged to surrender on terms disadvantageous to the Garrison.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, we have done our utmost to answer the questions your Excellency pro∣posed to our consideration.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, we shall come to such general ideas, as have occurred to us, and which your Excellency was pleased-to require of us.</P>
<P>We beg leave to represent to your Excel∣lency, that from the foregoing considerations, and the ruinous state the whole, and parti∣cularly the advanced works, are reduced to, from the uncommon cannonade and bombard∣ment which has incessantly been kept up against them, and the inability of the Gar∣rison to protect them from the Inner Covered Way, they are not in a condition to resist an assault, and of course no defence to the Fort, which must probably yield to the Enemy, on their own terms, soon after those works are taken or cut off, if no relief arrives from Great Britain before such an event happens.</P>
<P>It is therefore humbly proposed, in order to get the most honourable terms for the Gar∣rison, and the most advantageous to the Crown, and the most probable method of pro∣longing the siege, to give time for such relief to arrive, if it is the intention of England to send any.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
<P>That a suspension of arms be proposed to the Duc de Crillon, for a certain number of days to be named; and if before the expira∣tion of that time, not any effectual relief ar∣rives, the Fort to be given up (on the most honourable and most advantageous terms) to the superior force of the Enemy.</P>

<P>WITH great attention I have con∣sidered your paper, in answer to what I had the honour to propose, and lay before you this day. Your answer takes in a latitude I never meant to give you, that of the prudential reasons for entering into terms of capitulation with the assailants. The stage of the siege can by no means, in my opinion, admit of that: our only consideration at present is how to prolong our defence; it was upon that point, and that point alone, I consulted you. The idea of capitulating to me seems a very distant one; indeed it is mortifying that the expe∣rience I have had in the service has so little weight: the reputation I have acquired in it will not admit of my consent to propose any terms to the En<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my for the surrender of the place till we are drove to the last extremity; I have promised so to his Majesty; I told his Ministers we looked upon ourselves as a for∣lorn hope, who would glory in doing our ut∣most for the honour of our Master's arms. To think at this period of any reinforcement from England, must be chimerical; all we have to be solicitous for is our own glory: this is a consideration, in my poor opinion, infinitely beyond the political ones relative to the conservation of the seamen, the utility of the troops in future service, and the risque we run of being forced to surrender at dis∣cretion. I will pawn my military reputation that we shall never be reduced to that neces∣sity. Believe me, I mean to be prudent, but intrepid. Some confidence I expected would have been put in me; but as it is the opinion of the principal Officers of the Garrison (for without their concurrence I can expect little from the troops), I can only demand this obedience in the execution of my ideas, which in the most solemn manner I do. If it is not to be granted, I am no longer the Governor; I resign the command to the Lieutenant Go∣vernor, who is a better Officer, I sincerely believe, than I am; I am sure he is a better politician: so there may be no demur or up∣roar on the subject.</P>

<P>THE above Members being assembled, the Governor addressed them as follows:</P>
<P>THE Governor has the utmost confidence in the Officers assembled; he thanks them for their last opinion, but is sorry he cannot acquiesce with them in it.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
<P>He judges, that in our situation, the place should be defended to the last extremity, we being here as a forlorn hope, left to give spe∣cimens to the world of the bravery of the King's troops, both British and Hanoverian; and that idea must be pursued, as long as pru∣dence will admit; and the Governor is deter∣mined to endeavour to put it in force.</P>
<P>He has called the Officers present together, to give their aid and assistance, by their ad∣vice, to support his determined efforts in the execution of that idea.</P>
<P>In consequence of which, he thinks it ne∣cessary to lay before them the present situation of affairs, that by affidavits, and the most accurate examinations which he has been able to make, (which affidavits and examinations are laid before the Council, and hereunto an∣nexed) it appears certain that the Enemy are now undermining the Marlborough.</P>
<P>The Governor thinks, if that is clear to the Council, that the Marlborough, with every thing that can be useful for the defence of the Garrison, should be retired, and the Marlborough abandoned and blown up, and that without loss of time.</P>
<P>Humanity dictates this; the reinforcement that would be destroyed, in case the Enemy blows up the Marlborough, is necessary for our future defence.</P>
<P>By the information of a deserter, an at∣tack upon Charles Fort seems determined; to the Governor it appears probable. The re∣inforcement of the Garrison of the Marl∣borough, and others which are destined, will, it is presumed, render the attempts of the Ene∣my there abortive.</P>
<P>Last night a Serjeant, and four of the Cor∣sicans, deserted to the Enemy from Fort Marlborough; and this day, by the united information of several sentries, the troops from Cape Mola, and the French Camp, to the amount of 2000 men (as well as they could guess) marched from their posts and encampments towards Mahon. From thence the Governor judges the Enemy mean an as∣sault; and he thinks the signal for the assault may be the blowing up the Marlborough by the Enemy; and that is his reason for wishing to re∣tire the troops from the Marlborough this night, and blowing it up as soon as it is expedient.</P>
<P>He has no doubt but that, in an universal assault, the Queen will be one of their prin∣cipal objects, being reduced (in his opinion) to such a degree, that it is rendered above ground indefensible.</P>
<P>The General may be mistaken with respect to the situation of the Queen; and therefore the Chief Engineer, in his seat, is desired to give his opinion of the state of that work.</P>
<P>The Chief Engineer's opinion, relative to the Queen, is, that the defence from the ramparts of the work is at an end; and that he does not find, from the number of men which he believes the Garrison can afford, as working parties, and from the materials of which we are in possession, that it can be re∣stored to any reasonable degree of defence:</P>
<P>That he thinks, that although the fire from the Creneaux in the counterscarp of the Ditch is still entire, yet he thinks that fire is insufficient to the repelling a vigorous as∣sault:</P>
<P>That from what the Chief Engineer has said, the Governor is of opinion, that in case of an assault, the Queen, as well as Fort Charles, will be the principal objects of the Enemy:—That therefore he judges, for the honour of our arms, in the state in which the Queen is represented to be by the Chief Engineer, that it should be defended partially, that is to say, by chicane; so that the Enemy may be drawn artfully into the possession of it, and that at a proper period abandoned and blown up, the mines under it being loaded for that purpose:</P>
<P>That the usual daily guard for the Queen is sufficient to effectuate this; and that the night reinforcement for the Queen should retire from thence to Fort Charles, where the assault should be repulsed by every effort we can make:</P>
<P>That if the Enemy makes an universal as∣sault upon all the Outworks, before they are reduced to the situation of the Queen, it is the Governor's opinion they should be dis∣puted obstinately:</P>
<P>That when they are reduced to that si∣tuation, he thinks the same measure should be pursued with regard to them, as he has proposed relative to the Queen:</P>
<P>That with regard to a general assault on the body of the place, from the dispositions made, and the number of the troops in it, he is under no apprehension: on the contrary, for the honour of the Garrison, he wishes it may be attempted.</P>
<P>Thus the Governor has given every infor∣mation, he is in possession of, to the Council; and, as a proof of his perfect confidence of their zealous efforts for the honour of the troops, he relies on their advice with respect to what is to be done. To that respect he will comply with it, from the confidence he has in them, still determined to resist to the last moment.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
<P>Our honour requires it, and it is with that view he desires the advice of his Officers.</P>
<P>Having said this, the Governor proposed the following questions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Question I. Whether is the Marlborough to be abandoned immediately, and blown up, or not, this night; and the garrison of it sent to reinforce Charles Fort?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Question II. Whether is the Queen's Re∣doubt only to be defended partially, (that is to say by chicane) with a guard consist∣ing of one Captain, one Subaltern, and twenty-five Men; and when the Enemy are in possession of it, blown up; and the pre∣sent night reinforcement of that work sent to Charles Fort every night? The General thinks this can be done without the know∣ledge of the Garrison.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Question III. Does the Council approve of what is proposed relative to the defence of the Lunettes, which are still capable of de∣fence above ground; and when reduced to the state of the Queen, that they should be partially defended as that work? Or does the Council judge it expedient that the Lu∣nettes should, even in their present state, be only partially defended?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>ANSWERS <HI>to the</HI> FIRST QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Townsend answers in the affirmative, as expressed in the question.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Townsend.</HI></P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlet answers in the affir∣mative.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlet,</HI> Lieut. Col.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben answers in the affir∣mative.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar answers in the af∣firmative.</P>
<P><HI>J. C. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that the Marl∣borough should be abandoned and blown up, as the garrison of it is necessary for the de∣fence of Fort St. Philip's.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse is of opinion, that the same attention that has been employed about the Lunettes, on this side St. Stephen's Cove, does not appear to him to have taken place at the Marlborough; and that he thinks that the major part of the troops should be with∣drawn, but that a sufficient number of men should be left in it to blow it up, in case of an assault, or of the Enemy's blowing a mine of theirs: but that he thinks that the absolute evacuation of the Marlborough, and the imme∣diate blowing of it up by the mines we have prepared for that purpose, would be considered by the Enemy as an undoubted prelude to the surrendering the whole Garrison.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brewse,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of opinion, that the Marl∣borough should not be blown up this night, but evacuated immediately of its stores, &amp;c. as soon as possible for such an event, when that may be thought necessary, from further intelligence, or for strengthening the garrison.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. De Linsing leaves it to the decision of the Governor and Chief Engineer, as he is unacquainted with the defence of fortifica∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Linsing.</HI></P>
<P>General De Sydow also leave it to the de∣cision of the Governor and Chief Engineer, being unacquainted with the defence of for∣tresses.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> General Major.</P>
<P>QUESTION <HI>by the Governor to Col.</HI> BREWSE.</P>
<P>Whether or not Col Brewse does not think that drawing off part of the Garrison of the Marlborough, an effectual discovery will be made, by the first deserter from us to the Ene∣my, of our having abandoned the defence of it?</P>
<P>ANSWER <HI>by Col.</HI> BREWSE.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse does not think it fair to require such answers from him, as may tend to shake the opinion he has already given.</P>
<P>THE Governor did not mean any thing un∣fair by the question he put to Col. Brewse: he is sorry he is hurt by it: he only meant, in case he shall adopt Col. Brewse's idea, to have his advice how to execute it.</P>
<P>ANSWER <HI>to the</HI> SECOND QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Townsend's opinion is in the affir∣mative.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Townsend.</HI></P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlet's opinion is in the af∣firmative.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlet,</HI> Lieut. Col.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben is of opinion, that the guard should consist of thirty-three men, and the remainder of the night reinforcement be sent to Charles Fort: in other respects, he answers in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar cannot give his opi∣nion, with respect to the mode of defence of the Queen's Redoubt, not having visited that
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>post since the Enemy opened their batteries, being at Charles Fort, and entirely occupied with the defence of that work.</P>
<P><HI>H. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that from the ruinous state of the Queen, that only a partial defence should be made there by the guard; and that as soon as the Enemy got possession of it, it should be blown up, and the night reinforcement to retire into the inner works, where the Governor may think it the most necessary for their defence.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse is of opinion in the affirmative of the very words of the question.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brewse,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of opinion, that there does not appear to him any objection to the mode proposed, relative to the defence of the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. De Linsing answers the same as the first question.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Linsing.</HI></P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow answers the same as the first question.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> Major General.</P>
<P>ANSWERS <HI>to the</HI> THIRD QUESTION.</P>
<P>Capt. Townsend is of opinion, that only a partial defence should be made of the Lu∣nettes.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Townsend,</HI> Captain.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gauntlett is of opinion, that only a partial defence should be made of the Lunettes.</P>
<P><HI>W. Gauntlett,</HI> Lieutenant-Colonel.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Gruben is of opinion, that even in the present state of the Lunettes, a partial defence should only be made.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. De Hagar answers the same to this question as he did to the second.</P>
<P><HI>H. De Hagar.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of opinion, that as the Lu∣nettes cannot be supported by any troops from the Inner Covert Way, a partial defence of them should only be made.</P>
<P><HI>J. Acklom,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse is of opinion with Col. Ack∣lom.</P>
<P><HI>J. Brewse,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle, as he has the honour to com∣mand the British Lunettes, he cannot presume to advise the mode of their defence: but such as his Excellency the Governor will be pleased to order, he will execute to the utmost of his power.</P>
<P><HI>H. Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>Col. Linsing answers the same as to the other questions.</P>
<P><HI>J. W. Linsing,</HI> Colonel.</P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow answers the same as to the other questions.</P>
<P><HI>H. B. De Sydow,</HI> Major General.</P>
<P>The Governor, desires if the Members of the Council have any thing to propose for the defence of the place in general, that they will send it in writing.</P>

<P>AS Col. Brewse expressed some doubts, whether the Enemy's approach by mining was sufficiently ascertained by the evidences, which were produced to the Council;</P>
<P>And that even it appeared, by these evidences, that a delay of a day or two could not prevent the safe retreat of the troops from the Marl∣borough, the Governor thought it expedient to postpone the evacuation of the Marlborough that evening, and wait till the next night, that a satisfactory examination might be made by the proper Officers; which was accordingly done by Col. Brewse's direction.</P>
<P>The report (of these Officers hereunto an∣nexed) is produced and read to the Council. The Governor is induced to think from thence, and especially from their having altered their mode of attack, by erecting batteries to batter in breach, that the Enemy found insurmount∣able difficulties in attempting to undermine and blow up the work.</P>
<P>He therefore thinks it will be best not to abandon it, until a practicable breach is made by the Enemy's cannon, which he hopes will be work of time, as the cannon we are able to bring to bear against the battery newly erected against the Marlborough, have already, in a great measure, silenced it, and are likely to maintain their superiority.</P>
<P>He wishes, in this change of affairs relative to the Marlborough, to know the sentiments of the Council; and whether it will not be best to wait the event of the breach in the Marlborough being made practicable, and then for the Gar∣rison
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>to retire and blow up the Gorge, as was determined, in case of the certainty of the Ene∣my's having succeeded in their attempt to un∣dermine it.</P>
<P>Capt. Townsend is of opinion to let the Marlborough remain, till further events take place.</P>
<P>Col. Gauntlet the same.</P>
<P>Col. De Hagar is of opinion as the two for∣mer members.</P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of the same opinion.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse is of the same opinion as the foregoing.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of opinion that the Marl∣borough should not be abandoned at present.</P>
<P>Col. De Linsing is of opinion to wait for further events.</P>

<P>THE Council being assembled, his Excel∣lency the Governor addressed them as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>Brother Officers,</P>
<P>THE candour and openness, with which I have conducted myself with regard to you, makes it impossible for you to reproach me, or for me to reproach myself in any re∣spect.</P>
<P>Sixteen days ago, when you thought it ne∣cessary to advise a suspension of arms from the Duc de Crillon for a time, till succours might arrive from Britain, my experience dictated to me that that time was in our own possession; for, sure I am, had we men, we have nothing to apprehend from any attempts of the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the idea of an assault, he is a bold but ig∣norant Officer, who will (in my poor opinion) venture to assert we were exposed to such an at∣tempt sixteen days ago, when the ravages of the scurvy had not taken place. Now, the desertion of one man may alter the case; for this day we have only 741 men able to carry arms of the four regiments, 389 sailors, and 95 of the Royal Artillery now doing duty; of which number, viz. 1225 men, rank and file, 600 and odd are reported by the Faculty to be scor∣butic, and liable daily to be useless and unfit for any duty whatever. The reports of the Fa∣culty lie before you, (are hereunto annexed) and they attend to be examined.</P>
<P>It now remains for me only to apologize for not concurring in your first opinion, of imme∣diately treating with the Duke of Crillon, agreeable to your first opinion, given to me un∣asked.</P>
<P>In the first place, to that purpose I am to observe to you, that although I expected no succours from England, I thought we had the means of making a glorious defence for our numbers. That the asking a suspension of arms was a poor artifice, easily seen through by the most ignorant Enemy, and if granted, was only a matter of parade calculated to amuse the shallow military politicians of St. James's Cof∣fee-house. The loading and blowing up our mines, as has been proposed, served no other purpose. I abhor ostentation, as much as I de∣test regulating my actions with the view only of pleasing the English populace. Thanks to God, I am above such low artifices.</P>
<P>It has been averred by Officers of rank in the Garrison, that so deplorable was our situa∣tion a fortnight ago, that at two o'clock in the afternoon, it was practicable for the Enemy to march from their parallel, at nine hundred yards distance, and take by assault the Queen.—Charles the Twelfth of Sweden would not have made such an attempt. The man who will say it is even now practicable, I shall suspect his sincerity, or despise his ignorance.</P>
<P>It has been propagated that the Enemy were undermining us; the contrary has been proved. In short, the stories and ideas I have mention∣ed, tending to discourage the soldiers, and to alarm the young Officers of the Garrison, have had no effect.</P>
<P>That the Officers, almost to a man, are de∣termined to obey their Commander, and de∣pend upon his prudence and experience for the guardianship of their honour, and that of his Majesty's arms, I have had assurances from the mouths of most of them.</P>
<P>That the soldiers are animated with the same sentiments, is evident to every man: rather than yield and succomb under their present ma∣lady,
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>they consent to be lifted up to go sentry; and having performed that office, are found dead in their beds when called upon to take it again in their turns.</P>
<P>All this calamity, Brother Officers, has rush∣ed upon us since the 18th of January. You then thought it proper and necessary to ask a cessation of arms for a time, and at the ex∣piration of that time to capitulate.</P>
<P>The question now is, whether or not we should not capitulate directly? The parade of a suspension of arms, &amp;c. appears to me idle in our present situation. An immediate remedy for the relief of our most brave distressed soldiers is what we should try to obtain. The Duke of Crillon will not consent to recover men who may act against him; but he must consent to supply our hospitals with the only means of re∣covery, if we capitulate directly.</P>
<P>The question, therefore, I now put to you, which is the last I probably shall have the ho∣nour to propose to you, is, are we to capi∣tulate immediately, or are we to abide by your first proposition, of demanding a cessation of arms, at the expiration of which we must ca∣pitulate?</P>
<P>If we capitulate immediately, I have the ho∣nour to lay before you the terms (hereunto an∣nexed) which occur to me necessary to propose, and the mode of proposing them.</P>
<P>If any of you can suggest better terms, or a better mode, I shall be happy to adopt your ideas.</P>
<P>THE Members being called upon to give their opinions to the above questions, answered as follows:</P>
<P>Capt. Townsend answered, that the former opinion, given January the 18th, was to de∣mand a certain number of days to be fixed on, in order to get time in favour of a relief: yet (as appears) by the declaration of the Physician, and Surgeon General of the Island, the cir∣cumstances in which the Garrison was at that time, and is at present, entirely annihilates that idea. On which account, I humbly conceive the former opinion ought to be laid aside, and an immediate capitulation substituted in its stead.</P>
<P>Lieut Col. Gauntlet is of the same opinion as Capt. Townsend.</P>
<P>Col. Acklom is of the same opinion with the former.</P>
<P>Col. Brewse is of the same opinion.</P>
<P>Col. Pringle is of the same opinion.</P>
<P>Col. De Linsing is of opinion, from the de∣claration of the Physicians, and the impracti∣cability of the men doing the duty of the Gar∣rison, and to preserve the few men who re∣main, that an immediate capitulation should be made.</P>
<P>Gen. De Sydow is of the same opinion with Col. Lindsing.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the extraordinary increase of the sick in the Garrison, and the little progress we make in reducing this evil, we judge it ne∣cessary, on account of the public service, as well as our own credit, to inform your Excel∣lency, that the prevailing disease, the scurvy, amongst the troops, is got to such an alarming height, as seems to us to admit of no remedy in our present situation.</P>
<P>Every means has been tried to palliate this formidable malady; but the daily, and we may say hourly, falling down of the men, baffles all our endeavours.</P>
<P>The different Returns of the Sick will shew your Excellency the truth of this assertion. We are sorry to add, that it does not appear to us, that any one now in the hospital will be able to do the smallest duty under the present circumstances, where no vegetable food is to be had, nor free air.</P>

<HEAD><HI>REPORT</HI> to the <HI>KING</HI> of the <HI>PROCEEDINGS</HI> of the <HI>GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL,</HI> on the 30th of <HI>January, 1783.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Thursday, Jan. 30, 1783.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE several Members being re-assembled, pursuant to an Order from his Majesty,</P>
<P>THE Judge-Advocate General acquainted the Court, That he had it in command to express to them his Majesty's entire appro∣bation of their having pointed out those offen∣sive and intemperate expressions, which had appeared before them in evidence, obviously tending to the most serious consequences be∣tween Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper; for the preventing whereof, his Ma∣jesty is pleased to refer it to the Court-Martial, after weighing every circumstance, to propose some mode of accommodating the dispute, by such explanation, acknowledgement, and con∣cession, on either part, as the occasion may seem to require; and which may, in the opinion of the Court, consist with the honour of the par∣ties, and their character as Officers: And that it is his Majesty's farther pleasure, that, con∣vening the parties before them, they do exert their earnest endeavours to induce a reciprocal acquiescence in such honourable terms of ac∣commodation; and to obtain from each a so∣lemn engagement, that the difference shall there terminate, and have no further conse∣quences: To which end, the Court have his Majesty's permission to use his royal name, au∣thority, and injunction; as also, if they shall see occasion, to impose a strict Arrest upon both the parties, until a Report shall be made of the matter to his Majesty.</P>
<P>The Court, in obedience to his Majesty's commands, took the subject into their most se∣rious consideration; and, upon mature delibe∣ration, settled such Acknowledgement and Apo∣logy to be made on the part of Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, and also such Answer thereto to be expressed by Lieut. Gen. Murray towards Sir William Draper, as in their judgment the occasion merited, and as might be mutually given and accepted consistent with the honour of both.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<P>Lieut. Gen. Murray and Sir William Draper being then called in, the Judge-Advocate Ge∣neral notified to them the Determination of the Court-Martial upon the several matters of charge and complaint which had been referred by his Majesty's warrant for their decision, to∣gether with his Majesty's pleasure thereon, as follows: namely;</P>
<P>THAT the King had declared his royal appro∣bation of the opinion of the Court-Martial, upon every point; but that, in considera∣tion as well of the zeal, courage, and firmness, with which Lieut. Gen. Murray appears to the Court to have conducted himself in the defence of Fort St. Philip's, as of his former long and approved services, his Majesty had been graciously pleased to dispense with any other reprimand, in re∣spect of the misconduct whereof he has in two instances been found guilty, than that which the sentence of the Court-Martial in itself virtually conveys;</P>
<P>And that his Majesty had, at the same time, expressed much concern, that an Officer of Sir William Draper's rank and distin∣guished character should suffer his judge∣ment to be so far perverted by any sense of personal grievance, as to view the general conduct of his Superior Officer in an un∣favourable light, and in consequence to exhibit several charges, which the Court-Martial, after a diligent investigation, have deemed to be frivolous or ill-founded.</P>
<P>The Judge-Advocate General then informed the parties, That the Court-Martial had judged it their indispensible duty to make a representa∣tion to his Majesty of some expressions con∣tained in a letter from Sir William Draper, of the 16th of January, 1782, and of Lieut. Gen. Murray's answer thereto, of the same date, as having an obvious tendency to produce the most serious consequences <HI>[reciting the said representa∣tion from the Minutes of the Court];</HI> and that his Majesty had been graciously pleased to refer it to the Court-Martial, to settle some proper mode of terminating the matters in difference, in a manner which might be consistent with the honour and character of both; and, for effectu∣ating the same, had given the Court full per∣mission to use his royal name, authority, and injunction: In consequence whereof, the Court had entered into a particular consideration of the subject; the result whereof would be stated, with more propriety and weight, by the President.</P>
<P>The President then addressed the parties to the following effect:</P>
<P>THE Court having thought themselves in∣dispensibly obliged to take notice, in their Report to his Majesty, of some very of∣fensive words which came before them in full evidence in open Court, contained in a letter from Sir William Draper to Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.—<Q>Your insinuation, “that I am attempting to take the com∣mand ”from you, is <HI>false</HI> and <HI>infamous;</HI></Q> and also of an expression in an answer to the said letter from Lieut. Gen. Murray, viz.—<HI><Q>As to personal abuse, I shall do my∣self “justice, you may be assured, when the ”proper time arrives:</Q></HI> And his Majesty having been pleased to re-convene this Court, for the purpose of terminating this proceeding in a manner consistent with the honour of both parties;</P>
<P>I am desired, by the Court, to acquaint you, Sir William Draper, That they do not think those very offensive words, "false "and infamous," used by you, as above recited, to Lieut. Gen. Murray, your Commander in Chief, and in time of ac∣tual service, can be justified from any cir∣cumstance which previously happened; and therefore think it incumbent upon them to declare their opinion, that you ought to make a satisfactory acknowledgement to Lieut. Gen. Murray for the same, in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>“This Court-Martial having, upon mature consideration, expressed their opinion, that Lieut. Gen. Murray's letter to me, of the 16th of January, 1782, which drew from me the intemperate words in question, viz. "Your insinuation, that I am attempting to take the command from you, is false and infamous," did not import the charge of any actual at∣tempt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take the command from him, which, hurt as I then felt myself, I had conceived, I do not hesitate to acknow∣ledge, that those words were very impro∣per and unjustifiable, and to declare my concern for having used them; and I do, in deference to the sense of the Court-Martial, desire, that Lieut. Gen. Murray will accept this declaration as an apology ”for the same.</Q></P>
<P>And the Court are of opinion, That you, Lieut. Gen. Murray, ought to be com∣pletely satisfied with the said declaration, and express that satisfaction in the follow∣ing words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>“I do accept this acknowledgment as a suf∣ficient and full apology for the words used by Sir William Draper in his letter to me; and I do, on my part, express my concern, that I should have made use of any words which could have so much ”hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper.</Q></P>
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
<P>And the Court expects to receive from both parties the most solemn assurances, that this affair shall have no further conse∣quences.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper, upon hearing the terms proposed, declared his willingness to regulate his conduct by the judgement of the Court, professing himself content to make the acknow∣ledgement and apology, which the Court had prescribed as proper and consistent with his ho∣nour, and ready on his part to comply with their injunction in its full extent.</P>
<P>Lieut. Gen. Murray declared himself ready to abide by the injunction of the Court, with respect to the matter not having any further consequences, and to pledge his honour in that behalf, <HI>so long as he continued a soldier;</HI> at the same time remonstrating against, and objecting to, that part of the declaration expected from him, which is expressive of concern that he should have made use of any words which could have hurt Sir William Draper's feelings: And, upon an explanation being desired from him as to his complying with the injunction of the Court, <HI>so long as he remained a soldier,</HI> he plainly intimated, he should not hold himself bound to such compliance beyond that period, and that he trusted he should not be compelled to serve during life.</P>
<P>The Court, after having offered some con∣ciliatory arguments and explanation, recom∣mended it to the parties to withdraw for a time, and to Lieut. Gen. Murray in particular to consult some of his friends upon the subject.</P>
<P>After some space of time elapsed, Lieut. Gen. Murray returning, declared, that he still re∣tained the same sentiments, and, that he might not be misunderstood, had committed the same to writing, which he read, to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q>“In all private converns, I conceive I am master of my own actions; and I choose to keep my honour under my own preservation: in every military point, I am under the or∣ders of the King, whose commands are sacred. If Sir William Draper has been guilty of any military offence, the department to which it belongs will do justice to their country—As to what respects me privately, I seek for ”no interference.</Q></P>
<P>The Court, after having required and re∣ceived from Sir William Draper a pledge of his honour, that no adverse measure should origi∣nate from him in consequence of this unhappy difference, judged it necessary to remand Lieut. Gen. Murray subject to his Arrest, until a Re∣port of the whole proceeding shall have been made to his Majesty, and his royal pleasure shall be signified thereon.</P>

<P>I HAVE this day had the honour of laying before the King your Letter to me of the 1st instant, and should have thought my∣self deficient in duty to his Majesty if I had omitted to state the Letter which I had pre∣sumed, without receiving his special command-to write to you in answer.</P>
<P>His Majesty, intirely approving the proce∣dure of the Court-Martial, and the mode pre∣scribed by them for terminating the difference between you and Sir William Draper, had en∣tertained hopes that a deference to their opi∣nion, inforced by an express authority from his Majesty, would, upon calm reflection, have induced you to submit to their injunction,—as his gracious interposition had not for its object the passing over unnoticed the very intemperate words produced in evidence, but only the sub∣stituting an honourable concession, or some other proper mode of reparation for offence gi∣ven, in place of the violent and exceptionable measure which was manifestly in the contem∣plation of the parties,—and as the respective apologies which have been injoined by the Court appear to be strictly becoming, and due on each part, as well as requisite in point of example.</P>
<P>As the Court is not at present sitting to re∣ceive it, his Majesty is pleased to accept your solemn and explicit assurance, as pledged by your letter to me, that the matters in difference between you and Sir William Draper shall not have any adverse consequences originating from you, and has comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded me to signify to you an enlargement of the <HI>close arrest</HI> lately im∣posed, the immediate occasion whereof is by that engagement removed; but his Majesty has at the same time ordered me to inquire of you for his Majesty's information,—before you are wholly released from your former arrest, or his Royal pleasure be signified for dissolving the Court-Martial,—whether you still persist in declining to accept and comply with the terms of apology proposed to you from the Court.</P>

<P>The Memorial of Lieut. Gen. James Murray Most humbly sheweth,</P>
<P>THAT your Memorialist finds himself truly miserable that he cannot prevail upon himself to express, in the words prescribed to him by the Court-Martial, the Reply to Sir William Draper's Apology to him:</P>
<P>That, being conscious he never did say or write a word which was meant to hurt the feel∣ings of Sir William Draper, to declare to the world that he did, would be loading himself with the blame of having originated the un∣happy difference between Sir William Draper and him, which was so unbecoming, and might have been so hurtful to your Majesty's ser∣vice:</P>
<P>That, though he has upon all occasions de∣clared that he is most submissive to your Ma∣jesty's pleasure, still he is in humble expecta∣tion your Majesty will not lay your commands upon him to say what he does not think, and what would make him unhappy while he has an existence:</P>
<P>That, if it is still necessary that he should make some Declaration before the Court-Mar∣tial, he will most chearfully make the follow∣ing one, viz. "I do, in deference to the sense of the Court-Martial, accept this acknow∣ledgement as a sufficient and full Apology for the words used by Sir William Draper in his Letter to me; and I think it very unfortunate if any words of mine should have so much hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper, whom I ne∣ver did mean to offend while he was under my command at Minorca, as I have often declared both in public and private."</P>

<P>THIS Court-Martial having, upon mature consideration, expressed their opinion, that Lieut. Gen. Murray's Letter to me of the 16th January, 1782, which drew from me the intemperate words in question, viz. "Your “insinuation that I am attempting to take the ”command from you is false and infamous," did not import the charge of any actual attempt to take the command from him, which, hurt as then felt myself, I had conceived; I do not hesitate to acknowledge, that those words were very improper and unjustifiable, and to declare my concern for having used them; and I do, in deference to the sense of the Court-Martial, desire that Lieut.

<P><HI>Copy of a Reply made by Lieut. Gen.</HI> Murray <HI>to Lient. Gen. Sir</HI> William Draper.</P>
<P>I DO, in deference to the Court-Martial, accept this Acknowledgement as a sufficient and full Apology for the words used by Sir William Draper in his Letter to me; and I think it very unfortunate if any words of mine should have so much hurt the feelings of Sir William Draper, whom I never did mean to offend while he was under my command at Minorca, as I have often declared both in public and private.</P>
<P><HI>Copy of the Resolution of the Court-Martial upon the above Reply.</HI></P>
<P>UPON full consideration, the Court retain their opinion that the Reply which they, at their last Meeting, enjoined to be made by Lieut. Gen. Murray to Lieut. Gen. Sir Wil∣liam Draper, was just and proper; and they have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been honoured with his Majesty's entire ap∣probation; but, being willing to comply with Lieut. Gen. Murray's earnest wishes, as far as may be consistent with that opinion, and es∣teeming the Reply now offered in his own words to be of the same import, with this dif∣ference only, that it expresses a more direct disavowal of any intention to offend Lieut. Gen. Sir William Draper, than the Court had thought fit to enjoin, the Court does, agree∣ably to his Majesty's gracious permission, adopt the same, instead of the Reply which they had before prescribed, and declare that it ought to be accepted by Lieut. Gen. Sir William Dra∣per, as equally satisfactory.</P>

<HEAD>General MURRAY's Defence.</HEAD>
<P>Sir GEORGE HOWARD, and the other General Officers assembled on this Court-Martial.</P>
<P>I AM brought a prisoner before you, after forty-three years service in various stations, under all the different climates where his majesty's arms have been employed in the extensive ope∣rations, which will fill the page of history: during that period, without ever having been the author or the object of any military disho∣nour, nor the prosecutor of any officer to a public trial, much less a prisoner myself at the bar of justice; so that I freely acknowledge this to be the part of duty incident to my profession with which I am the least acquainted, as the court must have often perceived during the ex∣amination into the charges exhibited against me; yet, conscious as I was of my weakness in this respect, I felt such a strength in the in∣tegrity of my own intentions, and such a con∣fidence in the discernment and justice of bro∣ther officers, who are to judge of my conduct, has made me disclaim calling any professional advocate to my aid, how much soever the complicated accusations, with which I have been loaded, and my own poor abilities might have claimed that indulgence.</P>
<P>It is not my wish to conceal or perplex any thing—It is my desire to have every accusation sifted to the bottom.—It was this motive that induced me to apply for a Court-Martial to de∣cide on my conduct; some of my friends have thought I did wrong in pressing such a decision; it certainly is not a situation wantonly to be courted, but like other disagreeable occurrences in life, must not be avoided where honour calls for a judicial decision; and while I lament the trouble which so many respectable officers have undergone on this account, I will freely sub∣mit to their candour whether it was possible for me, under the insinuations thrown out, and which have now been publickly avowed, and the charges exhibited against me, to sit down quiet without demanding a public examination.</P>
<P>I am far from being vain of the talents which God has given me, or the experience which has fallen to my lot for the improvement of them in the line of my profession; and yet, without the imputation of self-conceit, I hope it may be allowed me to say, that I have some military reputation as an officer to protect; I feel also that, in the defence of the Castle of St. Philip's, under the various difficulties which occurred, and no hopes of relief, I have some merit with the public, concerning which, I was desirous that the whole army might have an opportunity of judging upon certain grounds; and also that my family and friends might pos∣sess, now and hereafter, a justification beyond the power of sophistry or malignity to impeach. Besides these motives, I had another incentive to press for this Court-Martial.—I conceived that the reputation of his Majesty's arms, and the national character, as well as my own, were concerned; and was therefore justly anxious that the truth of all the circumstances should be made known throughout Europe. For although I have made no complaints that no assistance was sent to me during so long a siege, and although I have endeavoured to avoid every imputation of blame upon others, and to confine the justification of my own con∣duct to the best disposition of the means put into my power; yet I hope the peculiar cir∣cumstances attending my garrison, in this re∣spect, will never be forgotten for their honour, and my own, by those who consider the final catastrophe.</P>
<P>In a scene so trying, with a feeble garrison, a defective fortification, and little hope of relief when attacked by the combined forces of such powerful enemies, I must consider it as a very unfortunate circumstance, notwithstanding the little regard I can now possess for General Sir William Draper, that a man of his rank, sta∣tion, and reputation for abilities, saw all my actions through the medium, which appears from the charges he has exhibited; for cer∣tainly
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>if ever disunion could prove of destruc∣tive consequences to the public interest, it was as far as it could operate in the situation in which we stood; and whether the causes of this disunion proceeded from me or General Draper, one or the other of us has much to an∣swer for to his country.</P>
<P>When I consider that the charges exhibited by Sir William Draper comprehend a period of two years, in which even the most minute ar∣ticle of my conduct, civil and military, has been examined with the most inquisitive cir∣cumspection in order to furnish matter of com∣plaint, it is surprizing to myself, in revolving upon the inaccuracies and accidents incident to human life, upon a strict review of what is past, when many circumstances are brought to light which were at the moment unknown, that I have not given more occasion to appeal to the experience of this Court for forgiveness in those omissions, which fall to the lot of the ablest officer in such transactions as those in which I have been engaged. I believe the siege of Sweidnitz is esteemed the best defence which has appeared in modern times; and yet, if Mr. Grebeval were asked at this day, when all the movements of all the besiegers are known, whether, in any one point, he would have acted otherwise than he did? it is possible he would acknowledge some error which he had com∣mitted.</P>
<P>Fortified with this opinion, if there was really any matter which I could believe might have been better effected in the siege of Fort St. Philip, I would now confess it; but I so∣lemnly declare, with the experience of eight sieges to aid my judgment, I do not conceive, upon reflection, how I could have acted other∣wise than I did with any advantage to the public. It is certain, though of no consequence, in the ultimate decision, that the naval arsenal had better been destroyed: but this was an object so much in the department of Captain Lawson of his majesty's navy, that I could not order it, and I trusted to him in the execution of what had been concerted between us.</P>
<P>That Sir William Draper should differ with me in opinion, upon various points of service, under the choice of such difficulties as occurred, is most natural; nor could I with any claim to a just understanding, be offended at this diffe∣rence in opinion, if the points in issue turned merely upon the question, whether the judg∣ment of Sir William Draper or my own weak opinion was the best? The military actions of the great<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n officers, both ancient and modern, have undergone the severest criticisms; and it would be the extreme of folly for any man to expect an exemption from that scrutiny; but the charges preferred against me do not admit of that manner of considering them. They necessarily suppose some corruption or treachery as the motives for my conduct, and particularly in not opposing the approaches of the enemy; this is the most captivating charge to vulgar minds who are ignorant of the bad consequences to be apprehended, and the little effect which is to be expected from firing incessantly on the first parallel, before the spots where the enemy intended to construct their batteries are disco∣vered: but so far from acting by caprice or re∣sentment, or what is still more ignoble, from mean jealousy in this respect, I will shew from a previous report I made to the king, that I acted in all things from deliberate resolves, drawn from my conception of the state of the fortification and the probable attack, and the best mode of defence which could be adopted under the circumstances in which we stood.</P>
<P>That the Duc de Crillon did attempt ac∣quiring possession of the fortress I commanded, by corrupt means, is known to all the world, as well as the answer I made to him at the moment, while I proclaimed the disgraceful pro∣posal. I claim no merit from this behaviour, I hope the meanest soldier in my garrison would have equally rejected such an ignominious offer; but I beg, while I claim no merit from such conduct, that it may not subject me to any ma∣licious insinuations.</P>
<P>It is beneath me to enter into any examina∣tion on that head.—The zealous defence I made at Fort St. Philip, although I would not waste my ammunition on every passing distant object, will sufficiently refute the imputation; at the same time it becomes proper for me to say, that Captain Don, my secretary, who will be ex∣amined on many articles of the charges, knows the whole of that transaction, if the Court shall incline to put any question to him on that subject.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, justly complain of Sir Wil∣liam Draper, for endeavouring to prejudice the public opinion against me, by a number of charges, which he has not even professed or at∣tempted to establish in proof. But I derive too much advantage from such a conduct, before discerning and upright judges, to speak of it as an injury. The surest way of judging of the truth or probability of any doubtful accu∣sation, more especially of one that ought only to have public justice for its object, is by examining closely the spirit in which it is made.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
<P>If in such a complaint of a public accuser, there are any, much more if there are many charges evidently dictated by malice or gross prejudice; if there be found a number of articles which he must have certainly known from the beginning to have been incapable of the slightest support from evidence, which could therefore be introduced for no other reason than to prejudice and defame, and which he himself seeks even against the wishes of the accused to abandon and retract, the presumption in the minds of just and saga∣cious judges, is, that the same temper pervades the whole accusation, and thus the innocence of the accused derives support from the injustice of the accuser. Whether this observation ap∣plies to the case before you, I must submit to the judgement of this Court, who have heard the evidence adduced by the prosecutor, one of the heaviest charges against me, and which has made the greatest impression on the public is article the 1st, letter B.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Giving out in public orders on the 8th day of January last (being the third day of the siege) that the enemies battering train was such as had never before been brought against any place of the first magnitude since the in∣vention of gunpowder, and that the garrison might be assured that the defence of Fort St. Philip's had little or no dependance upon its artillery, which orders tended to augment the terror of the enemies attack, and to cool the zeal and ardour of the artillery men of the gar∣rison, and from the date of which order, the fire from the place became almost extinct in the day time; and the enemy redoubled their efforts.</P>
<P>Now is it possible for any man to read the entire original order, and pervert the plain and obvious meaning of it to such an accusation as is stated above, or to believe that a man could suppose that this order should have the effect of dispiriting the Corps of Artillery as described in the charge? I ask if there has been a tittle of evidence under all the discontent which bad success in war always generates, to vindicate the assertion; I do not pique myself on being an elegant writer; I have carried arms from my youth, and was not educated for any of the learned professions, neither did I ever study the words of any military order, with a view of parade; I wish at all times to make my mean∣ing intelligible; and I can only declare to this Court, that I never was more unfortunate in conveying my sentiments, or less understood, if my words contained in that order can bear the interpretation which my accuser has put on them; for my intention was to rouze the spirit and vigilance of the garrison, and to dissipate some little alarm which the opening of so unusual a train of artillery against us had occasioned.</P>
<P>In like manner I submit to the Court whether the 1st. 2d. 3d. and 4th. articles in the charge A are not of the same complexion; and I leave it to the world to judge what weight is due to any charge exhibited by Sir William Draper, who could assert to his Majesty A article 5th. in or∣der to induce a belief of neglect and surprise on my part, and the rapid approach of the enemy on the other, that even my own goods, plans, and papers were seized, and the troops retired into the Fort with great confusion, loss and dis∣grace. I refer to the evidence produced, and I submit to the Court, if there is the slightest ground for such allegations.</P>
<P>Several of the other articles which Sir William Draper wished to abandon, were evidently ex∣hibited to the public with the same view of injuring me in their good opinion; and it was for this reason I would not consent to their being withdrawn, that the Court might be convinced in one of two alternatives, either that my accuser had preferred his complaint without due investi∣gation or knowledge of the subject, or that not∣withstanding he had previously examined the matter, his prejudices were such, that he was willing to hazard his reputation upon assertions that could not bear examination, in hopes he might relinquish them at his pleasure, after they had been included in the King's Warrant, and read by a credulous public.</P>
<P>Of this kind I submit to the Court, whether I have not a right to consider A article the 9th, B article 3d, article C, D article 2d and 3d, E article 2d, F article the 1st, 2d, and 3d.</P>
<P>The great question in this enquiry is, sub∣stantially, whether I defended the fortress of Saint Philip's to the utmost of my abilities, and whether I surrendered it to the enemy before there was a justifiable necessity so to do. In the articles exhibited by my accuser, there is an ap∣parent contradiction; first he charges me with not sufficiently retarding the enemy's approaches, and next he accuses me of surrendering the place when no impression had been made on the body of the work, nor the advanced batteries of the enemy nearer than 500 yards, and this after they had set down before the place six months. It would appear from thence however, whether from our activity or the enemy's negligence, that the enemy's approaches had been retarded for some cause or other, and as the place was not surren∣dered from the impressions made by their attack; therefore as far as respects the public, the question seems of no consequence; but in what regards my
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>military reputation it is very material; and I hope to demonstrate to the Court, that there was not the least degree of blame to be imputed to me; but I repeat again, that the sole question as to the public, turns on this, viz. whether a severe and rapid sickness from the scurvy among the troops, and a pestilential fever incident to that putrid disorder, obliged me to surrender the place when I did; and whether, supposing that to be the case, I was the cause of that calamity, or whether I did not do every thing in my power to prevent its effects? these points I wish may be investigated to the utmost.</P>
<P>I admit, with my accuser, that the place might have held out for two months longer, if this un∣foreseen calamity had not seized the garrison; and all my conduct was governed by that be∣lief, as I shall shew in many instances.</P>
<P>Still I cannot admit, even under the evil con∣sequences of this dreadful disease, that our de∣fence was by any means dishonourable to his Majesty's arms.</P>
<P>The Fortress of Saint Philip's was besieged in the last war; the garrison then consisted of 3252 men, of which 2951 were regular troops; the army of the Duke de Richlieu was 14000 men; the place was taken in 72 days after an effort was made to relieve it, and the Governor was made a Peer.</P>
<P>My garrison consisted of 2692 men, of which number only 2016 were regular troops, inclu∣ding 400 Invalids sent from England in 1775; the army under the Duc de Crillon was 16000; and from the time of his landing, to the time of my surrender, was 171 days.</P>
<P>I had no relief sent to my assistance, my un∣fortunate worn out soldiers suffered every hard∣ship incident to the want of vegetables and foul air. I suffered many of those calamities in com∣mon with the rest, and did not surrender my garrison until all the principal officers of the fort were unanimous in their opinion that no further effective defence could possibly be made; and in reward, I am a prisoner before this court, loaded with imputations of the foulest and blackest nature, drawn up by a man, who seems to have been harbouring malice against me from the year 1780, and couched in lan∣guage the most opprobrious and reproachful to a soldier.</P>
<P>These are the general observations which I presume to make on the accusation preferred against me; I shall next proceed to answer them article by article, and to adduce evidence in support of what I affirm to be the truth. In doing this, I must beg your patience if I should trespass on your time in too long an examina∣tion, where perhaps the matter is already clear to the members of the Court-Martial, who are so conversant in the subject; but as my age and a broken constitution, worn out in the defence of Fort St. Philip's, may be the last military service of any consequence in which I shall be engaged, I wish to make it evident, not only to my brother officers, but equally clear and intelligible to every member of the community, that I have not either by ignorance, negligence, or design, betrayed the trust reposed in me; but that on the contrary, I have acted to the best of my abilities with attention and zeal, for the honour of my King and Country, and the glory of the British arms, as yet unsullied by any act of mine.</P>

<HEAD>The Preambles to General MURRAY's Defence to each Article of Charge.</HEAD>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>IN opening this article of charge, the Court must remember the manner in which Sir William Draper wished to have waved it. He said (no doubt in the spirit of candour) that there were many things and many precautions taken by me, becoming <HI>a wise and prudent go∣vernor;</HI> that he would not rob me of any praise where it was due; but that in other re∣spects I was sometimes careless and negligent; that my conduct was inconsistent, and that he had produced this article to prove my negli∣gence and carelessness.</P>
<P>In order to consider this charge fully, as no doubt the general turn of my character, whe∣ther vigilant or careless, must influence very much in judging of the other charges; I beg leave to enter more particularly into this article than either the evidence produced or the import of it would otherwise vindicate.</P>
<P>From the intelligence I had established, it was impossible that any attempt to surprize Fort St. Philip's could take place without my knowledge; such an attempt could only be in the summer months, in flat boats or row gal∣lies, from Barcelona or Majorca; such vessels cannot approach the coast of Minorca in the winter months: but I was aware of the pos∣sibility of such an enterprize in the summer, and therefore was very anxious to have barracks built for the officers of the garrison of the fort, as will appear by my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the secre∣tary at war, dated 14th of March 1776.</P>
<P>From the want of such barracks, it never had been thought necessary by my predecessors in command, to put all the officers of the re∣giments doing duty in the Fort, to the hard∣ship of lying with their men in the subterra∣neans. There never were more at any time, peace or war, ordered to lie in the fort, than the numbers which could be accommodated in the quarters of the Governor and Lieutenant-Go∣vernor in the Square, and in the buildings in Charles Fort. It never had been the practice to mount more than one officer's guard, consist∣ing of a captain, a subaltern, and from 24 to 50 men, varying as occasion required, and three or four serjeant's guards, from eight to fourteen men each.</P>
<P>Innovations, which put gentlemen to what they think unnecessary trouble, and affect their convenience, are to be made by degrees, and properly timed; it being essentially necessary in a governor to cultivate the affections, or at least the good will of his officers. My standing orders, and the general orders of the 31st of De∣cember, 1775, upon the diminution of my garrison, and the arrival of the Hanoverian battalion, will shew, when produced to the Court, that I was not inattentive to keep up discipline and military decorum.</P>
<P>I refer more particularly to the articles 6th, 7th, and 8th, and my order of the 31st of De∣cember, will further make it appear, that the guards were augmented from 48 to near 300 men, and that I appointed a field officer of the day, which had never been done before.</P>
<P>Still it may be urged, that military decency was neglected, by not obliging all the officers to lie with their men in the fort, as they must have done had they been encamped. The case however is different, proper accommodations are allowed the officers in camp; it has been the in∣variable and necessary practice to oblige them to keep with the men in the field: the example of the officers in that case is necessary, and should not be dispensed with. In Fort St. Philip's, where there is no accommodation for them, the sol∣diers were accustomed to be sensible of the im∣propriety of all the officers lying in the sub∣terraneans; and therefore their being better ac∣commodated in the barracks at George Town, which was so very near, and built on purpose for their reception, had no bad effects in point of example: it had none in point of security at the time my accuser mentioned, in February 1780; for, as I have said, to surprize us by gal∣lies, or large row-boats, was at that season imprac∣ticable; besides, I have had certain information
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>of every step the enemy took at Barcelona, Car∣thagena, and Majorca. I relied on my in∣formation from these places, and knew that their garrisons had been diminished to reinforce the camp at St. Roque, so that of course there would be no design against us in any of those ports: there was no necessity therefore to order all the officers into the fort.</P>
<P>There was no fleet of the enemy in the Me∣diterranean at this time; Lord Rodney had de∣molished the Spanish squadron in the month of January, and rode triumphant in Gibraltar Bay; he had supplied the garrison with its wants, and detached three ships of the line to escort the victuallers sent from England to us.</P>
<P>That there was a rumour every year, from the commencement of hostilities with France, of an intention to invade our island, is as cer∣tain as it was natural.</P>
<P>That I encouraged such reports is true, it being necessary to stimulate the efforts of every one, to put the rotten, feeble fort, in as good a state of defence as its situation would admit of. The engineers will declare what was done in that respect, from the first suspicion of a rupture with France to the day my accuser ar∣rived; they are to declare if it was possible for my garrison, with the assistance we could get from the inhabitants, to do more than was done; they may in this place likewise declare, whether every thing was not carried on with uncommon oeconomy; for one of the charges against me is, squandering the public money.</P>
<P>The commanding officers of corps will tes∣tify the pains I took in the discipline of the troops, and my care to have them instructed in the exercise of the great guns, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and made acquainted with the subterraneans of St. Philip's.</P>
<P>My attention to the ordnance department, &amp;c. appears by the orders, 31st of January, 1779, which will be produced.</P>
<P>I hope my accuser will remember he said often, and in public, that he was surprized to find we had done so much. It is but fair to mention this declaration, as it exempts him from the suspicion of wishing to insinuate from this charge, that nothing was done till his own arrival; an insinuation which would be as un∣just as it would be ungenerous.</P>
<P>The certain intelligence I had of the efforts the enemy were making in the month of March, to build and equip large floating bat∣teries at Majorca, and fitting their magazines with provisions, &amp;c. at Carthagena and Barce∣lona, induced me to order an additional batta∣lion into the fort, and the officers of the regi∣ments quartered there to remain in it during the night. This, however, I did with no other view than that of stimulating our operations, for nothing, I well knew, could then be in readiness to assail us by the vessels in question, till late in the autumn.</P>
<P>This will be proved by my orders, 21st of March, 1780, and with the same view I went into the fort on the 15th of April, where I re∣mained till the middle of June, by which time I got certain intelligence that the floating bat∣teries, the provision and stores collected at Bar∣celona, were, as soon as built and collected, sent to the camp at Alguiziras.</P>
<P>If it is necessary, the engineers will inform the Court what was done to improve the fort while I was in it. They may declare what I committed in charge to the lieutenant-governor to be done, when I left him the entire command of it, with power to do whatever in addition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought necessary to be done: and they may also point out what part of the works I had ordered, was executed accordingly, and what additions were made by Sir William Draper, and their utility.</P>
<P>Every charge exhibited against me by the ac∣cuser must be supposed to proceed from his zeal for the public; of course he should have proved that the troops suffered in point of discipline and good order, from the officers sleeping in George Town; but his report to his Majesty, as reviewing-general of the regiments in gar∣rison, assures the king, they were defective in nothing but numbers and vigour, the two British regiments being worn out.—This report will be produced.</P>
<P>The accuser cannot pretend to say, that the works in the fort could have been forwarded by the presence of the officers in the night, when no work was carried on; and in the day time the proper officers actually attended the work∣ing parties. Had more guards been mounted, fewer men could have been spared for the work∣ing parties; of course this first charge is a mis∣taken excess of zeal in the lieutenant-governor for the good of his country.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>In the years 1777 and 1778, the houses in Saint Philip's, excepting the officer's quar∣ters, were destroyed and levelled. In 1779, I judged it expedient to raze the whole town, which was certainly a great inconvenience to the officers of the garrison, both civil and mi∣litary. Hence I judged it proper to shew the example of a total demolition of the house,
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>allowed me as governor, with the gardens and every thing, at Stanhope's tower, the stable and a small house for a guard room excepted. A guard there, was necessary to prevent the sol∣diers from straggling, and getting drunk in the wine houses, at Tourach. These two insigni∣ficant offices could afford no protection to an enemy, being only 30 feet in extent, and the walls but one cantoon stone, of 13 inches thick, at the distance of 800 yards from the fire of the place, and being conspicuously ex∣posed, every shot, every shell, even cohorns, penetrated, as is proved by all the evidence. Colonel Brewse having declared his opinion, that their standing was attended with no bad consequences, and captain Townsend, that they afforded a shelter from the view only. Hence this magnified object was not, nor could be of any utility to the besiegers, not even to mask their operations. For it is not true, as charged, that the enemy took post there, to the detri∣ment of his majesty's troops; for, in fact, their guards were wisely posted in a hollow, covered from the fire of the place; neither did these two small houses mask their batteries, which were placed about 30 yards, advanced between them and the fort.</P>
<P>I submit to the court, whether it be credible, that I should have made such a sacrifice to the public safety, as the destruction of my own house, of such elegance and conveniency, and yet leave an useless building standing, if I had conceived, or had ever been advised, that it could have been detrimental-in a siege.</P>
<P>The accuser perhaps wishes to insinuate by this charge that these houses were left standing from selfish motives; but they were actually of no use to me: it is true there were about 20 pair of pidgeons put in the loft of the stable, but even this use was not made of it till the spring before we were attacked.</P>
<P>The accuser ought to remember how lavish he was in praising not only the disinterested de∣struction of Stanhopes Tower, but the demoli∣tion of the beautiful and profitable Baranca there, but at that time things were seen thro' a different medium.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>Had Fort St. Philip's been situated in a morass, and only accessible by 3 or 4 roads, not to have blown up these roads, would have been unpardonable, but the whole surface of the ground between Mahon and Saint Philip's islittle more than two or three inches of earth covering the road; the country is divided into fields, by walls, which are of loose stones col∣lected from the surface; these walls are instant∣ly thrown down; 50 pioneers, I think, might have made apertures in them in two hours, all the way from Mahon to where the enemy's bat∣teries were erected; these apertures were all that was necessary to make excellent roads in any direction, from the artillery park of the besiegers, who actually availed themselves of this advantage, and were not so imprudent as to use the great road in question, further than within 300 yards of Middle Mount, (being little more than 1-3d. of a mile from their park of artillery) after they found that the rest of that road was exposed to the fire of the place.</P>
<P>The reparation of the road in question, so pompously made a charge against me, consisted only of some Cantoon gravel, to render it smooth where it was rough; it was equally good be∣fore that reparation for the transporting of can∣non or any other burden; it had that repair to render it more agreeable to the garrison, and the inhabitants of Mahon and George Town; this road being the usual walk for their recreation, and daily passing the guards to the fort, Capt. D'Arcy, and Capt. Townsend, witnesses cal∣led by my accuser, have proved that the road was a good practicable road for artillery before the reparation, and that it was no obstruction, even to coaches, more than to make them shake.</P>
<P>These two officers have further proved, that if the enemy had landed at George Town, they would even then have only crossed it; that as it was they made roads to the right and left of it; and that the road from the enemy's park of artilley, to Middle Mount, was out of sight of the garrison; Lieutenant D'Arcy further faith, that from the enemy's park of artillery, to the place where they turned off to their batteries, was only 600 yards; that he never saw any cannon upon it, and supposed that 300 pioneers, could in one day, have made a road, from the park of artillery, to where the enemy's new road turned off, sufficient for the carriage of the heaviest ordnance.</P>
<P>The fact is, that from that point, it was so open to the artillery of the garrison, that the enemy never attempted to use it, but made new roads; for Capt. Fead declared, that after the day he fired upon the carriages at Middle Mount, he never saw any more upon it.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>The detachment at Cuitadella, consisted of 1 subaltern, 1 serjeant, and 32 rank and file; and that at Fornillis, of 1 subaltern, 1 ser∣jeant,
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>and 13 rank and file, in all 45 rank and file, worn out and decrepid invalids, as has been proved by Captain Butler and Lieutenant Smith; it would have been unpardonable, nor to have had out-posts at those two places, being the best for the disembarkation of troops, and where the enemy landed in 1756; they were necessary to give warning of an enemy's approach on these sices, and to keep the men at the signal house alert, and to protect the towns from the insuits or the enemy's privateers; for this lest purpose there were <HI>two</HI> 6 pounders and <HI>four</HI> carronades at at Cuitadella; <HI>two</HI> 6 p unders and <HI>two</HI> carro∣nades at Fornellis; with ammunition in propor∣tion at both places; if I remember right, 30 rounds for each piece, which ordnance and am∣munition were ordered to be destroyed, or if practicable, sent into the fort on the approach or appearance of a fleet to invade the island.</P>
<P>On the 14th of August, 1781, when I re∣ceived intelligence that we might be invaded, the orders already produced were sent to the commanding officers, at the posts in question, <HI>which I beg leave again to be read.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the first appearance of the enemy's fleet on the 19th of August, expresses were sent to these officers, of which they have acknowledged the receipt; and between 2 and 3 o'clock ex∣presses were sent with fresh instructions to ad∣vertise them of their approach, and to order them in through bye roads, as shall be proved; it is not true that the artillery or stores were inter∣cepted, as asserted in the charge, having been destroyed agreeable to orders: I must suppose the Lieutenant Governor to have been ignorant of the orders given to the commanders at these posts, and of the measures taken for their preser∣vation; for if he was not, I think he would hardly have made this a charge, since it appears by the evidence called by himself, that every precaution was taken on my part, which pru∣dence could suggest; and that Lieutenant Smith, in throwing blame on me, was in fact proving his own misconception of clear and distinct orders.</P>
<P>At the same time it is but justice to Captain Butler, and Lieutenant Smith, who were made prisoners by the enemy, to declare that there was not a man in the island, who thought a Spanish army could have landed in five hours after the fleet had appeared on an open and ex∣posed Iron coast, which afforded no good anchor∣age from the rocky bottom, and where there were no bays, but the hazardous ones of Alque∣four, and Sandy Bay, in which with difficulty even boats can land, when there is the least wind. For my own part I did not think it practicable, nor can I yet conceive, why the Duc de Crillon hazarded so much. The tri∣fling naval stores in the dock yard, were not objects to justify the risk of such an enterprize, even though he had known it was in his power to seize them.</P>
<P>As to the other part of this charge, viz. that I had previous and specific intelligence from his majesty's ministers at Florence and others, of the attack intended. It appears, from the evidence already produced, that my accuser has ventured this assertion on as bad authority as many other of his articles. I had no intelli∣gence whatever that could be deemed specific; the whole depended on probability and conjec∣ture, as appears by the words of Lord Hillsbo∣rough's letter, which I only received on the evening of the 14th; yet no circumstance, which the most accurate information could have suggested, was omitted by me.</P>
<P>The information from Sir Horace Man and Mr. Udney, did not reach me till the arrival of the Lemon, the 5th of September, 16 days after we were invested.</P>
<P>Having received the intelligence I before mentioned from Lord Hillsborough, late in the evening of the 14th, I immediately communi∣cated it to the lieutenant-governor, covered by the following letter to him.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Hospital Island,</HI> <DATE><HI>14th Aug.</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear Sir William,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P>"Sir William Draper, &amp;c."</P>
<P>“P. S. I communicate the intelligence to Captain Lawson; was I in his place I would endeavour to check the Spanish Shavages ”which annoy us.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When I breakfasted with the Lieutenant Governor, he was of opinion the destination of the armaments in question was most likely for the Spanish American colonies, as we were in∣formed they were at that time in rebellion, as there were no magazines found either at Barce∣lona, Carthagena, or Majorca. However, I thought it necessary to prepare for every event, by issuing the following orders, (early on the morning of the 15th) the day after I received the intelligence, and to the watchmen at the signal towers, and also the orders to Captain Butler, and Lieutenant Smith, which have al∣ready been proved, and to the jurats and other civil officers in that quarter of the Island.</P>
<P>What other precautions and directions could my duty require, or my situation, enable me to take and to fulfil?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by my letter to Sir William Dra∣per, already produced, that I acquainted Cap∣tain Lawson of the intelligence contained in Lord Hillsborough's letter.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th, Captain Lawson called on me; he seemed thoroughly persuaded that we were really to be attacked; it had long, before the alarm, been concerted between him and me, that in case of an invasion, it would be proper to destroy, not only all that was in the dock yard, but to burn all the craft in the harbour, that the enemy might not avail themselves of them; he therefore judged very properly, that in our present situation it would not be prudent for him to quit the har∣bour, to check the enemy's small privateers; but as soon as the wind would permit him to get his ship up to the head of the harbour, not only to execute what had been concerted, but to cover and bring down the transports that were loading the beef mentioned in my letter to Sir William Draper, which we had been obliged for want of store room in the fort to lodge in the dock yard; unhappily the wind blew strong down the har∣bour, and Captain Lawson never got the ship up; but the beef was most of it thrown into the sea.</P>
<P>Without entering into all the uninteresting e∣vidence which has been produced upon this arti∣cle of charge, it will sufficiently appear to the Court, that in this, as in the preceding articles, there was no culpable neglect on my part.</P>
<P>Mr. Harris has declared that I communicated to him my intelligence respecting the enemy, upon the 15th of August; that I consulted with him relative to the quantity of stores, and the means of removing them, which he informed me could be done with sixty men in forty-eight hours; that he accordingly applied to Captain Lawson for the necessary assistance; and tho' it was not immediately granted, it appears that the greater part of the stores were removed on board the store ships; it is admitted by my ac∣cuser, that every thing a-float was entirely un∣der the command of Captain Lawson; I shall therefore confine myself to the dock yard, and if I exculpate myself in that particular, which I hope to do beyond the power of contradiction, the other follows of course.</P>
<P>Mr. Harris declared that he considered him∣self as under the command of the senior officer of the navy, and that upon a former alarm, he had conceived it as his duty to make the first application to him; his instructions from the Admiralty are to this purpose, and admit of no misconstruction.—He declares he had orders from the Admiralty, to give me every assistance in his power from the stores under his charge, which evidently shews that I had no authority whatever over him or them; to remove every shadow of doubt upon this head, I shall produce to the Court, a Letter to Lord Barrington, by which it will appear, that I understood I was not permitted to interfere in any thing relative to the dock yard; Mr. Harris has not distin∣guished between the value of the stores which were left in that yard, but, inconsiderable as they were, it would certainly have been proper to have destroyed them; it was so concerted be∣tween Captain Lawson and myself; and I did expect that he would have put our purpose into execution.</P>
<P>The reason for not doing so, which he gave to me, was the small value and consequence of the remaining stores, and the damages which would have been done at the store houses and mast house, and other buildings, supposing the
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>siege to be raised, or the island to be restored at the peace.</P>
<P>As to the beef belonging to the garrison, it appears from my letter to Sir William Draper, that I had given the necessary orders about it, and that the execution of these orders was en∣trusted to Lieutenant Case, of the marine corps, who was under Sir William Draper's com∣mand.</P>
<P>As to the stationing a vessel, I shall prove by lieutenant Douglass, who was present when I concerted with captain Lawson the putting the Minorca at the head of the harbour, that it was not from any omission of mine that the ship never got to the place; but in justice to the memory of captain Lawson, it becomes me to shew that she could not be carried there on account of contrary winds. At the same time the Court will observe the small consequence the failure occasioned, since it could only have obliged the enemy to make a circuit of a mile or two at the most; neither could the division of the enemy which landed at Alquefour, have thereby been impeded on their march to Mahon.</P>
<P>As to the concluding part of this article, I am ready to prove what I now declare, that every plan and paper in my possession when the enemy landed, are now in my possession, and have always continued to be so; and as to the disgraceful retreat of the troops, I shall prove they marched with perfect regularity into the garrison, an hour before the enemy landed on the island, and that the guard at Mahon to cover the retreat, entered the fort in the same good order at sunset.</P>
<P>That both officers and men lost some of their baggage (occasioned by the delinquency of the Minorquines, who gave no aid in transporting it to the garrison) is true; but after having issued the order of the 15th of August, for the rugiments to be ready to march into the garri∣son at a moment's warning, I can only lament the loss, however trifling, which my brother soldiers sustained, and express my concern that their characters should have been called in ques∣tion on that account, without taking the smallest degree of blame to myself.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in justice to them, I should further observe, that on two former alarms, they had sent their baggage into the fort at a considerable expence, which made them less credulous on the authority of a letter, so vague as that from the Earl of Hillsborough.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Sixth.</HI></P>
<P>In answer to this charge, it is necessary to lay before you my report to his majesty of the state of the place and its environs, dated the 20th of August, 1780, a year before we were besieged; and I must beg of the Court in con∣sidering this charge, as well as my order of the 15th of October, and that of the 8th of Janu∣ary, particularly to remark, that I foresaw the measures which the enemy would probably pur∣sue, and foretold what conduct I should hold in consequence.</P>
<P>The report was read by the Judge Advocate, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>General Murray's Report to the King of the State of Fort St. Philip's, and its Dependencies.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding all its defects, this place, with an adequate garrison, should make a glo∣rious defence in the state it is now in; if leave is given to remove the ground, which protects the barranca from the fire of the besieged.</P>
<P>The garrison should not be less than three thousand five hundred rank and file, with offi∣cers in proportion; two companies of artillery, viz. 214, including the officers, a company of 50 miners, commanded by a captain, a lieute∣nant, two serjeants and two corporals, and five hundred British seamen; these last are necessary, because no assistance can be got from the inha∣bitants, even as labourers, and the troops will be sufficiently occupied in exertions at arms, &amp;c. At all times a guard ship is necessary in this harbour, especially in time of war, for its protection, to preserve maritime order and dis∣cipline amongst the privateers, and for many other good purposes not necessary to mention.</P>
<P>This guard ship, in time of war, will con∣stantly be furnished with the requisite number of seamen, by the supplies we shall have from the exchanged prisoners of war, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The masonry is perhaps the worst which was ever seen; I cannot account for its being so, because the materials are most excellent, and at hand. The pieces of the fortifications do not cover one another as they ought, and are commanded every where at the distance of 500 yards; at which distance the besiegers may commence their operations without being ex∣posed to a shot from the fort: the nature of the country makes it impossible to correct this defect; it will therefore behove the besieged to exert their skill, address, and industry, to pre∣vent the enemy from quickly destroying the defences of the place; for this purpose, a large magazine of facines, gabions, hurdles, earth, &amp;c. &amp;c. to repair the demolished batteries, is laid in.</P>
<P>The ground is now every where levelled, and
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>laid open to the fire of the place (the grand bar∣ranca excepted) to the distance of 500 yards from the outward covered way; the space from the place to where the besiegers can open their first batteries, without regular approaches, is an entire rock, and some compensation for the defects and disadvantages I have mentioned; because, from that distance all regular advances must be by sap ouverte, and the earth and ma∣terials brought from a great distance: hence the necessity of imposing on the besiegers, by re∣serving until this stage of the siege, the fire of our repaired batteries, that of the new pro∣jected ones, and of the field pieces, mounted on the carriages, we have contrived to fire from the covered way, and the salliant angles of the works, (a model of which is sent by Captain Scott, for his Majesty's inspection) and like∣wise the fire of the mortars made in the rocks, (as described in the plan) which can throw to the distance of 450 yards, betwixt two and three hundred weight of stones.</P>
<P>Captain Mayne was the first that practised here, this most useful and cheap invention: the idea was taken from the use of them at Malta; the ground within the fortification doth almost every where admit of them; their suc∣cess is certain, and as neither them, the field pieces, nor the new proposed fascine batteries, can be much exposed, even to the recochet shot of the assailants, defective as we are in several capital points, our defence above ground, were the corps now in garrison completed with good men to their establishment, should not be con∣temptible; if we had the requisite garrison, I am confident it would be glorious.</P>
<P>The strength of St. Philip's consists in its subterraneans; they afford such a variety of chicane and resource, that every inch, from the glacis to the body of the castle, may be ad∣vantageously disputed by the mines and small arms, after the defences above ground are to∣tally demolished and the artillery annihilated; hence, the necessity of an established company of miners for this singular fortification. This may be done at a very small expence, by draft∣ing fifty miners from the whole army into the corps serving here, to he paid as miners only; when they are employed as such, one British will do the work of two Minorqueen miners; but the Minorqueens are out of the question; they will not work for us in time of war, and at no time should they be trusted with the knowledge of our subterranean defences; a captain, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en shillings per day, a lieutenant at five, and three serjeants, who being likewise serjeants of the regiments they belong to, may be allowed an additional shilling each, is all the requisite expence of this company; much more than that sum may be saved by keeping the pallisades in shades, till it is necessary, in time of war, to plant them; I have tried the experiment, and will forfeit my reputation if the whole are not effectually erected in the space of three weeks. When the board of ordnance consi∣ders the immense expence of the pallisades of this place, they will, no doubt, admit of this proposition, and allow the saving must produce double the sum requisite to defray the expences of the mining company.</P>
<P>This place, I mean the simple castle, will hardly admit of the glory of defending a breach made in it; nor indeed to wait till that breach is practicable. The powder magazines being all under the square, on a level with the bottom of the ditch, I fear when the enemy have got possession of the counterfcarp, the best chance of holding out longer will proceed from their dread of partaking of the universal havock which the blowing up of the castle must occa∣sion at a great distance; the besieged and the besiegers must be then precisely in the situation of Van Trump and his antagonist on the barrel of powder, each armed with a red hot poker; but before matters come to this issue, there may be op∣portunities enough for every man to signalize, himself; for with a sufficient garrison no work should be taken without regular approaches and practicable breaches; these breaches may and should be obstinately defended. But, alas? when our present garrison is compared with the extent of our works, we must not suppose the enemy will think it necessary to make regular advances to us, after he has in safety at the dis∣tance of 500 yards, mined our defences and silenced our batteries, he should judge it expe∣dient to save the lives of his troops to assault the place. Weak as we are, his first attempt will be ineffectual; an intelligent officer will expect, that perhaps he will mean by it little more than a discovery of our resources and pre∣parations for such an event; but this discovery will not make him alter a plan which must, by repeated well concerted measures succeed in the end against so small a garrison, was every man of it a Hercules. It is with a very heavy heart I report this opinion to my Royal Master, who may be assured that we cannot be surprised; and that I can answer that no exertions which men are capable of will be wanting in every in∣dividual for the support of the honour of his Majesty's arms. It is, however, a melancholy reflection, that little honour will be paid to our memories by mankind in general, from an ima∣gination
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>that the regiments here are stout and well completed; our efforts will be judged in∣sufficient, even should every man of us expire in the execution of his duty.</P>
<P>As it may be imagined from what is said a∣bove, that the heaviest artillery will be employ∣ed in the defences opposing the land attacks, it is judged requisite to ask a supply of seventeen twenty four pounders, with their proportions of stores, there being no guns of that calibre here; these with twelve carronades will amply supply the place of large artillery, which have been taken from the sea line. I understand the res∣pective officers of the board here have applied to the board of ordnance in England, for eight twelve pounders, in lieu of those lost in the Besborough packet; but they agree with me, if the supply I now solicit is granted, we shall have no need of the eight twelve pounders.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The enemy took advantage of the barrancas or ravines, which I have mentioned in that re∣port, not only to convey and cover all the ma∣terials they wished to amass for the construction of their batteries and redoubts, but to cover the troops who mounted in the trenches, where they could not be seen from the garrison, and were little exposed to our shells; their parallel, or what the accuser calls a sap, being behind the crest of the rise, and fortified by beams, placed sloping against the parapet; under the cover of which, the troops were in perfect security. The enemy finished a wall thickened by sand∣bags, from 10 to 30 feet thick, on the crest of the said rise, from Stanhope's tower, to their lowest battery above the Mahon road; their parallel below the road towards the harbour, had the same advantages: under the mask of this wall their batteries were constructed, and of course, it was impossible for us to know exactly where or how many batteries were forming; all we could do was to batter and open this wall, which was frequently done without any disco∣very of a battery; but the breaches made in it by our artillery were constantly repaired in the night: these attempts of ours were made, how∣ever, of use in retarding the progress of this wall, as they obliged our assailants to give it a greater thickness, which rendered it impracticable, as Major Walton and the chief engineer can testify: I consulted both of these officers, and others who agre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with me, that the annoying of this masking work, in these places where it was car∣rying on and not perfected, was all that could be done. To have attempted more, considering the extent of it, must not have only reduced us to want of ammunition, but have destroyed our embrasures; for so rotten was the masonry of the fortification, that our own fire brought down the merlons: when it is considered, that the enemy began this masking wall the begin∣ing of October, and did not finish it till the 7th or 8th of December; it must be allowed my conjectures were well founded, and that every thing which prudence could dictate, was effec∣tually done to retard their progress. On the 11th of December, a deserter from the enemy informed us most exactly (as it afterwards ap∣peared) where the batteries of the besiegers were marked out; he said some of them had been be∣gun some days, and that others were not yet begun; all which proved true; for the masking wall of the battery, opposite the Queen's re∣doubt, was not begun till the 10th of Decem∣ber, and I believe the French battery on the Philipet side, was not in much greater forward∣ness. Captain Dixon of the artillery, who speaks the Cantalan (the language of the de∣serter) and perfectly knows all the environs of the place, was ordered to go to the top of the castle from whence every thing was to be seen, that he might be perfectly master of the spots where the batteries were pointed out by the de∣serter, and to inform instantly all the artillery officers how to direct their fire against them; this was done, and from that moment an incessant fire was ordered to be kept up against these ob∣jects. I told Major Walton that now was his time, that we must no longer think of sparing our ammunition, as we knew the proper objects to fire at: he and his officers exerted themselves to the admiration of every body; they did great damage to the masking wall, which still they could not effectually lay open; however, their success must have been great in retarding the erection of the batteries of the besiegers, which were not finished till the 5th of January, a space of time no less than 26 days; it is well known that most of the batteries were begun at the same time: they were divided amongst the regiments, and called by their names, to stimulate and ex∣cite emulation: every intelligent officer knows that five days is sufficient to construct any bat∣tery in any situation; our men under the direc∣tion of our engineers, raised the merlons of one from the sole of the embrazures, which was all the enemy had to do, in eight hours; the en∣gineers and officers of artillery raised one from the level of the platform in 16 hours; this was done to practice our men in constructing ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tteries; these batteries, were fired upon at the distance of 200 yards, and found sufficient to the convic∣tion
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>of every soldier in the garrison, of course it must be allowed the enemy was greatly retarded, and the effect of these operations defeated as much as was in our power; to have totally pre∣vented their approaches, and the construction of their batteries, must be allowed to have been im∣possible. They consumed no less than 1,200,000 two bushel sand bags, and 60,000 facines; hence it may be granted, that if they were not retarded by our efforts, they were at least searful of the consequences, and provided accordingly; since the time when they begun their masking wall, to the 6th of January, when they opened their batteries, was little less than three months.</P>
<P><HI>The average quantity</HI> of powder expended from the 27th of October, when the enemy appa∣rently began their masking wall, till the 11th of December, when the deserter came in, was 402 lb. daily.</P>
<P><HI>The average quantity</HI> from the 11th of Decem∣ber, till the enemy opened their batteries, was 3243 lb. the difference is 2841 daily, which, from the 27th of October, to the 11th of De∣cember, (being 45 days) would have made a difference of 127845.</P>
<P>The quantity of powder left in the garrison when we surrendered, was 3511 barrels, or 351100 lb. which would have been no more than sufficient for 30 days longer firing, at 11500 daily, which was the <HI>average rate of powder</HI> expended during the last eight days, when the enemy had opened their battery between the Ba∣rancas.</P>
<P>Had we, from the 27th of October, when the enemy first begun their wall, kept up the same fire which we did after the deserter came in, and pointed out where it might be kept up with effect, 127845 lb. more powder would have been expended, which would have reduced us to 223255 lb. sufficient for only 19 days; and the fort was in a situation to have defended itself two or three months longer had the garrison kept healthy.</P>
<P>Thus much as to the state of our powder; as to shells (cohorns excepted) only 1200 were left, and the cohorns were of little use, all the cohorn mortars, but one, being rendered unser∣viceable.</P>
<P>In this general charge, much stress has been laid by the prosecutor, on suffering the battery to be erected at Philipet without more interrup∣tion. It appears, by his own report to me of the 3d of December, that at that time Sir William thought the walls there to be no more than a line of communication, yet he has endeavoured to prove his prescience in saying to some of the witnesses, there would be a battery there; the moment I perceived the enemy's intention, I ordered a new facine battery of 6 heavy guns to be erected against it, which opened with great effect long before the enemy had compleated their battery on Philipet; if we had perceived the enemy's intention sooner, perhaps we might have retarded them some days longer, but they must have then prevailed.</P>
<P><HI>Another point</HI> Sir William Draper has endea∣voured to impress on the minds of the court, namely, that the guns of the N. W. curtain of the castle (which he always calls the West cur∣tain) did not fire on the burgoss; I shall prove to the Court, that not a single gun in that cur∣tain, could be brought to bear on the enemy's battery called burgoss.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Court will observe that all the experienced officers already examined, and particularly Colonel Brewse, the chief en∣gineer, have declared that no effectual stop could be put to the continuance of the enemy's mask∣ing work, in the manner they proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> many experiments were made.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> a vigorous exertion of artillery was fre∣quently tried.</P>
<P>And that an attempt to destroy this wall, if persisted in, must have reduced the garrison to surrender for want of powder.</P>
<P><HI>Additional Observations on the Masking Wall.</HI></P>
<P>After all I have heard upon the possibility or impossibility of preventing the Duc de Crillon to establish his first parallel, and the batteries con∣structed upon it, it is incumbent on me to make the following observations, and to desire they may be inserted in my defence. In the first place, that first parallel has been proved to be carried through ravines, so as to be covered from the fire of the sort; it has likewise been proved that the besiegers made roads not exposed to our view, to convey every thing requisite for the construction of this parallel, and their batteries; it has been proved, that notwithstanding the na∣tural advantages the ravines afforded, the besie∣gers built a masking wall, at an average about 20 feet thick; the extent of this wall was no less than 2000 yards, viz. first from the Rus∣sian hospital across the whole breadth of Cape Mola; second, from the enemy's batteries across Philipet Peninsula; third in front of the bourgois battery; fourth, from the lower flank of the savoya battery, up to Stanhope's tower; fifth, in front of Turks mount battery. It was built with great caution in the night; we may judge from the appearance of it, that every regi∣ment built the wall which masked the battery
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>destined to be constructed by the regiment, for it was irregularly carried on, but joined at last; so cautious were they in the erection of this wall, that they undertook no more in one night than what could be sufficiently fortified to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si every attempt of our's to demolish it the suc∣ceeding day; the experiments we made again and again to convince us of this truth, have been clearly proved to the court. I had scouts out almost every night, engineers frequently; their reports to me were confirmed by what I saw with my own eyes in the morning. I was con∣vinced then, and am still of the same opinion, that it was impossible for us to prevent the erection of this masking wall. It has been proved that the masking wall in the front of the battery of Bourgois, after we had battered it many hours, was re-established the next night under the continued fire of the garrison; this happened the night of the 10th of December; the return of the expenditure that day was 128 rounds, almost all expended on that wall, which was only 100 yards in length, and 500 from the garrison; had a proportionable fire been kept up on the rest of the thickened wall, 2000 rounds would have been daily expended, and the effect must have been less than upon that before the Bourgois; as that at Turk's Mount excepted, they were all at an average above 700 yards, which being much more than the range of point blank shot from the nearest work which could bear upon them. The court and the world will judge of the practicability of de∣molishing, by our cannon, this wall, wherever it was constructed. I declare I know of no other method of retarding its progress than that of throwing small shells, and sometimes shot, towards the places where we imagined they were extending it. That this was done with vigour and activity appears from the quantity of shells expended from the latter end of Septem∣ber to the 12th of December. I acted to the best of my capacity and judgment: I took the best advice I could get of the chief engineer, and the commanding officer of artillery. I had the honour of my country at heart, and my re∣putation was at stake. I claim merit in what I did. I am an old officer. I have had much experience, which experience told me then, and still tells me now, that none but an enemy could have advised me to throw away my ammu∣nition in combating this masking wall, erect∣ed beyond point blank shot of my place. Had this been the case then, indeed I must have been disgraced, and the reputation of my former ser∣vices blasted; then I must have surrendered to the assailants, who were not nearer than 600 yards, for want of ammunition, a fortress, capable of some months resistance from the day the enemy opened their batteries, had not the hand of the Almighty interfered and reduced my garrison by sickness, to a degree of debility which made it impossible to resist a moment longer than we did: as I did not foresee this misfortune, was it not my duty to reserve my ammunition in proportion to the probable re∣sistance I thought we could make. My feeble garrison would not admit of disturbing the ene∣my by frequent forties; had it been strong, I certainly might, by well concerted ones, have retarded the progress of the besiegers; but that means was not in my power.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Seventh.</HI></P>
<P>This battery was 1330 yards from the garri∣son, and solely intended to scour the entrance of the harbour. If the enemy had constructed an epaulment between it and the sort, or had raised merlons to it, which at that distance we could not have hindered, the embrassures of that battery being pointed to the sea, could not have been opened by any gun in the garrison; and all the guns of the place would not have prevented the enemy from keeping up a well di∣rected incessant fire against any vessel coming into the harbour. It was not my business to shew the enemy their error, and this I declared at the time, as will be proved. The event justified this conduct; for when the Fly came into St. Stephen's Cove, the enemy was soon driven from their battery, which was then fired at for her protection, having had only time to fire four of the five guns they had on it, and it was not till some time after that one of them found courage to steal back and fire the 5th; and the only consequence our firing at it before could possibly have, would have been to make them retire the guns behind the traverse, made in the rear of their battery for that purpose, and to have induced them to have completed it with proper protections.</P>
<P>This is another of the charges which evi∣dently shews in what light Sir William Draper endeavours to represent my conduct; since it is hardly credible that he was not sensible of the propriety of leaving this battery undisturbed: but if he did not see the obvious error the ene∣my had committed, in such case less regard can be paid to his judgment; for, upon the en∣trance of the Fly, all my predictions were justi∣fied respecting this barbet battery.</P>
<P>A. <HI>Charge the Ninth.</HI></P>
<P>Captain Lawson intended to have sent his frigate to sea under the command of one of his
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>officers, on the night of the 19th of August; but from the situation of the enemy's ships of war, he judged the escape of the frigate im∣practicable, of which he acquainted me the next morning; and, inconsequence thereof, I desired the ship to be sunk, and the crew to march into the fort to reinforce the garrison; for the same reason I desired the transports and General Murray privateer to be sunk. These measures must have been allowed to have been proper, as, at that time, an immediate siege was to be ex∣pected, and the crews of the vessels not to be dis∣pensed with in the defence of the fort. Captain Lawson, some days after the ship was sunk, re∣quested I would give him my desire in writing to sink her. I chearfully did so, because I thought the sinking of her proper, and knew that he must answer to a court-martial for the loss of his ship. For the same reason I gave orders in writing to the masters of the transports and other vessels which were sunk, that they might recover the value of them from the public.</P>
<P>What would my accuser have said of me, if (weak as my garrison was) I had not availed myself of the crews of these vessels for our de∣fence. In this charge I am accused of sinking the ships to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy: in a preceding one I am accused of not destroying the dock yard.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>The great superiority of the enemy's artillery, and the effect which it had on our rotten works, was evident to the youngest soldier, per∣haps alarming to all. The great superiority of the artillery was likewise visible; it became therefore absolutely my duty to acquaint the gar∣rison that the defence of the place did not solely depend on the exertions of the ordnance. Had I neglected this, the men, at small arms, little ac∣quainted with the defence of fortified places, would from the superiority of the enemy's fire have looked upon themselves as vanquished.</P>
<P>I therefore in the subsequent part of the order which the accuser has prudently omitted, point∣ed out to the troops, that the great strength of that place consisted in its subterraneans, mines and ditches; from these I told them the works were inaccessible; and that it was from an ob∣stinate defence of these that they were to gain that glory the world expected from them. I likewise stimulated the artillery to new exer∣tions, by assuring the garrison that they were still vigorous. Of course, that great efforts from them were yet to be expected; that the fire from the place, even on the north side, was far from extinct, has been proved by all the evi∣dence (till by the order of the 17th of January) the guns on that side were retired during the day, and only employed in the night; and when the enemy, busy in repairing the damage done to their batteries by our shells, and the explo∣sion of their own guns, were exposed to our shot. The prudence of this last order would have been severely felt by the enemy in carry∣ing on their second parallel, if the health of the garrison had allowed it to continue the defence till that stage of the siege, had it not been for that precaution of retiring our guns, plunged into, as we were, on every side, we should not, at the time of our surrender, have had such a con∣siderable number of guns mounted, nor would that formidable number of artillery, men, and sea∣men (on which the accuser expatiates so much) have existed.</P>
<P>The sire was kept up at times on the battery at the Russian hospital, and constantly on that between the Barancas from the moment it was discovered. The accuser says, the garrison was discouraged by this order. Has he been able to produce a man who was daunted by that or any other event of the siege? Colonel Pringle has only ventured to say, that it might have had that effect. Sir William Draper's resentment against me, must be violent indeed! since to injure my character, he would sacrisice the reputation of so many brave men, and even the credit of the arms of his country.</P>
<P>After explaining my reasons for issuing this order, all further comment upon it would be im∣proper, as pretending to bias the opinion of the court, who are the best judges whether this is a military order or otherwise; or whether it could possibly have the effects pretended in the charge.</P>
<P>As to retiring the guns in the day-time, on the superiority of the enemy's fire, to reserve them for defeating their subsequent approaches, it is agreeable to the system I have laid down in my report to the King; and the fact was, that the enemy, on advancing their boya, were so much annoyed by our artillery, they were obliged to desist; and, in that state of the boya, the capitulation took place.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>The places of arms were not abandoned, nor the communications from them to the ditches shut up, till the ruinous situation of both ren∣dered it unsafe to maintain them, and, till the increasing weakness of the regiments from sick∣ness, which, though not arrived at the violence it afterwards did, was already considerable, did not leave a sufficient number of troops for their defence.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<P>It is impossible for me to explain this busi∣ness more than by the council of war, held the 18th of January, where my reasons are sully set forth, and these reasons met with the appro∣bation of all the officers assembled, although Colonel Pringle forgot, in his evidence, that in what he seemed to condemn before the court, I was justified by his own advice at the time of the transaction. I visited the place of arms between the south west outward raveline and west coun∣ter guard, the morning of the 19th, on a report of Captain Brick, and found the entrenchments so much hurt by the enemy's fire, during the preceding day, it being only a two foot wall of masonry, that I was of opinion, in which the engineers agreed, that it was untenable. The place of arms at the Salient Angle, north west outward raveline, was not abandoned at the sur∣render, nor would the new place of arms have been abandoned had not the stairs been destroy∣ed by the enemy's shells.</P>
<P>In our situation a general assault was what we had reason to expect, which must necessarily have been bassled, while we could defend our ditches.</P>
<P>The number of men we then had was barely sufficient for the defence of them and the inner works; besides, as the scurvy had then begun, and I was assured by Dr. Munro that there was a great likelihood of its proving fatal, particu∣larly amongst the Hanoverian troops: every thing that by easing the duty of the garrison could be done to prevent that dreadful disorder was necessary to be done; since it is universally known to be promoted by excess of fatigue and anxiety of mind.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>As the sickly state of the garrison shewed the impossibility of defending the place any consider∣able time, it was certainly my duty to make it cost the enemy as much blood, and gain as much glory to his Majesty's arms as was possible; the reason for only partially defending the outworks are specified in the second council of war, which will, I hope, justify me to this court.</P>
<P>If the enemy had made this much wished for attack on the lunette, the mines, fougasses, and stone mortars, would not have been idle.</P>
<P>The accuser, so early as the 9th of January, declared, in a letter to me, that, in ten days the Marlborough ought to be abandoned, that key of the garrison, which being once in the power of the enemy, the possibility of receiving suc∣cours from England was at an end; and, in my opinion, the enemy's approaches on that side might then have been rapid and fatal.</P>
<P>From all which the censuring the soldier-like plan of defending the Lunettes by chicane, be∣comes more inexcusable in the prosecutor.</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>As my acquittal or condemnation must chiefly turn upon this material and affecting charge, I beg the court to examine rigidly every particular ex∣hibited on the occasion to the council of war; by this examination they will see my reasons for pro∣posing to surrender, and the unanimous opinion of that council so to do, I must not, on this occasion, pass in silence; my surprise that Major-General Pringle should insinuate blame in my conduct at that council, he being one of those who, unask∣ed, advised me to propose to the Duc de Crillon a suspension of arms, and a conditional surrender, 19 days before, and previous to the inveterate disease, which reduced us to the impossibility of resisting longer. This honourable court and all the world will establish the censure where it should fall. If the calamity of my garrison was exaggerated, or made a pretence for surrender∣ing St. Philip's; if any attempt was made by me to deceive the council, to concur in giving that advice to their governor, the most severe punishment should justly fall to my lot. If, on the contrary, our misfortune was real, and be∣yond the power of men to remedy, I and my advisers deserve applause from their country. Hu∣manity will plead for it as our due; necessity must justify it. How far it was becoming Sir William Draper, the instigator of this previous advice to surrender on conditional terms the 14th of January, to accuse me criminally for surren∣dering on the 4th of February, after this inve∣terate calamity had made an hospital of my gar∣rison, and a spectacle, considering our circum∣stances, which would have convinced the most obdurate heart, the court and Europe will de∣termine. I shall shew this was the case, and I shall prove beyond contradiction, when the date of the paper given to Colonel Pringle, by Sir William Draper is considered, and the contents of that paper, advising the treating with the enemy for a cessation of arms, which were com∣municated to the said council of war, that such was even at that time the opinion of my accuser; my letter to the officers upon receiving this advice, will sufficiently demonstrate the disposition of my mind, and my determined purpose of holding out the fort as long as re∣sistance could be effectual; but when overcome by this disposition of providence against all my efforts, I acknowledge, that for the chance of keeping the fortress three or four days longer at the most, I could not suffer so many brave
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>men to perish, who had merited every return of good offices from me and their country, when it was in my power to save their lives by obtain∣ing vegetables and fresh air.</P>
<P>If the accuser would have made a longer de∣fence, the honor he might have gained would have been dearly purchased by the lives of num∣bers, who must have fallen by the hand of heaven, not that of the enemy? would any ho∣nest man purchase honor at so dear a rate?</P>
<P>B. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>If I had given out the orders mentioned in the charge, to march out the corps as weak as possible, it would have been no crime in me to lessen the triumph of the enemy, but the fact was, that by the Duc de Crilion's letter of the enemy, of the 4th of February 1782, the troops were to march to Alleyor, which is eleven miles from the castle, and the enemy's general desired that such of the garrison, as from weakness were unable to march to Alleyor, might, as well as the sick and convalescents, remove to George Town, till they were able to join their respec∣tive corps; but the whole of these men, except the sick and convalescents, so far as belonged to the four regular corps, were included with the effectives in the return inclosed to the Secretary of State, and were also included in the numbers stated in my letter to him, as appears by the original returns, which have already been laid before the Court.</P>
<P>It is true, that in that letter the number of the marine corps is mentioned to be 200, where∣as the real number of effectives, rank and file, on the 2d of February, were 424, including boys, artificers, and 93 men, reported to be scorbutic by the surgeons, and who probably would all be in the hospital in a few days; and in the same letter, the number of artillery was stated to be 120; whereas the real number of the effectives, rank and file, were, on the 31st of January, 104. These two errors in the numbers, by one of which the number of seamen is stated too low, and by the other the number of artillery too high, arose in the following manner. When I made the rough draft of my letter, to the Secretary of State, I put down the name of each corps, among which the marine corps, Corsicans, Greeks and Algerines are particularly mentioned, leaving a blank after each, to be filled up by the Adju∣tant general from the returns; he accordingly filled them up, but was lead into a mistake as to the marine corps, by a return delivered to him, on the 30th of January, by the adjutant of the said corps, in which return the numbers, rank and file, are stated to be 316; and from this erroncous return, the adjutant general deducted the boys, and the men returned on the sick list, between 30th of January and 5th of February, and inserted the balance, as the true number; he error as to the artillery men, arose from the adjutant general's reserring by mistake to a pre∣ceeding return instead of the last; but it is evident from the two mistakes, being on opposite sides, that there could be no possible intention to deceive, neither could the Secretary of State be misled by these mistakes, since the minutes of the council of war, of the 3d of February, were laid before him, with my letter, in which minutes I stated the number of the marine corps, rank and file, deducting the boys, at 389, which was the exact number; the Corsicans, Greeks and Algerines, are stated in that letter according to the returns; and therefore the charge is not true that they were suppressed.</P>
<P>C. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>This idea of retaining hostages in our debili∣tated state, or waiting a moment in relieving the sick after the preliminaries had been signed, is so contrary to the principles which induced me to surrender, that it would have been both useless and cruel to have deferred the essential business for that ceremony; and after my distress was known to the enemy, the best security was, a generous conduct, trusting to the honour of a soldier, which was given. All the articles were fulfilled; and why my accuser should be an∣gry about hostages, I cannot conceive; I shall call no evidence about this: the trivial losses which the officers sustained by the irregular con∣duct of the Spanish troops, in forcing the souf guards, placed over the baggage of the different regiments, was amply paid, according to the estimates they delivered, as has been proved, and whatever Colonel Pringle may think of twelve hours notice, as necessary for marching his regiment, I conceived then, as I do now, that it was my duty to get the troops into fresh air, and supplied with vegetables, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>At the time the wool was purchased for government, I had every reason to expect a vigorous and immediate attack, and in that case we could not take down the useless buildings with that care which was necessary to save the cantoon stones. There were not enough of these in the ditches, to serve the mines alone; such as were intended for this purpose, having been otherwise employed (whilst the Lieutenant Governor commanded in the fort,) in erecting useless barbet batteries, every thing that could supply the materials for making the traverses became an acquisition. The chief engineer de∣clared
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>to Lieutenant Douglass, my aid-de-camp, that we were happy to get the wool; and the proper place to put it in, was the top of the castle, as the safest, and being centrical, it could most conveniently be moved from thence to where it might be wanted; I therefore ordered it to be valued by merchants, who fixed the price at five dollars per quintal; I then ordered the quarter-master general, to acquaint the agents of privateers, that if they would not lower it, their wool would be returned to them, it was accordingly lowered, to three dollars per quin∣tal, at which price, (after having stood the wea∣ther for six months, and being scattered and dirtied by the shells) the Spaniards sold it when the castle came into their possession.</P>
<P>This will shew that no unjust or inordinate price was given; but I must remark, even in such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple transaction as this, before the Court, that my accuser cannot charge me, without dealing in amplification; for the wool in question, cost only 763 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> instead of 900 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as stated by Sir William Draper. This has been proved by the witnesses he called.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>The house at Stanhope's Tower, was built at the expence of goverment, and all repairs want∣ed to it were put in the yearly estimates sent home to the board of ordnance, as has been pro∣ved by Captain Townsend. The thing com∣plained of in this charge, was the employing about six men for a few weeks, in repairing the walls of a poultry yard, seven months before the invasion. The Court will perceive the spirit which has actuated my accuser, when he could state such a trivial matter as a solemn charge against the <HI>Governor of Minorca,</HI> and bring evi∣dence upon it, before seventeen general officers.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>The marine corps was composed of the pri∣soners of war, which were exchanged from France, before a cartel had been settled; the agreement I had made with the enemy, was so much approved of by the King's service, as to continue in force by the cartel, while we were in possession of Minorca.</P>
<P><Q>“All prisoners taken in America, or in any part of the world, and carried into the domi∣nions of one or the other power in Europe, shall enjoy the benefit of this agreement; and it shall be left to the good faith of the nations to adjust, according to the regulations of this agreement, the exchanges which may have been carried on by virtue of any cartel already entered into by the Governor of Minorea: and any persons duly authorised on the part of France respecting prisoners brought to that Island, and into the French ports in the Mediterranean, and to obviate all difficulties respecting such prisoners, the ex∣change of whom it is intended shall be com∣pleated in the said ports in the Mediterranean; proper orders shall be given as conveniently can be, after the ratification of this cartel, for their being accordingly reciprocally re∣leased and exchanged from time to time, without regard either to their number or qua∣lities; and for the transmission of proper cer∣tificates from the respective agents, and com∣missioners of both nations, in order that the balance of the general account of exchanges ”may be duly adjusted between us.</Q></P>
<P>It is well known that the garrison of Minorca, even in point of numbers, was one regiment less than the peace establishment; and that the two British regiments were composed of worn out invalids, as has been already shewn by Sir Wil∣liam Draper's report of the garrison.</P>
<P>I had authority from the King to do what I could to supply our wants in men, &amp;c. which could not be spared from the pressing calls of other services.</P>
<P>The exchanged prisoners were a natural and happy resource, but we could not have availed ourselves of it, had not some of them been em∣ployed at sea, with the chance of getting prize money: every body knows the attempts that were made to intice these men from the fort, and not only the privateers, but even the King's ships, threw out the lure; they will be shewn by Sir William Draper's complaint to Lord Sandwich upon this subject.</P>
<P>The best expedient at that time we could think of to satisfy the minds of the seamen, and to make them a part of ourselves, was to man two small privateers with some of them; these were or should have been relieved every cruize, or the prize money divided amongst the whole; Lieutenant Colonel Case, who had the direc∣tion of such matters, has declared not only the arrangements he made in that respect, but the necessity of giving a chance of prize money to the men of the marine corps. Those serving on board were certainly paid and victualled, as the others were on shore out of the magazines of the garrison; that I had authority to do this must be admitted; I trust the measure will be judged proper and expedient; it certainly was not done without the approbation of the Lieu∣tenant Governor, who had the corps under his immediate command and protection, as he did them the honour to be their Colonel without pay.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
<P>When the measure was first concerted, I con∣sulted him about it, we were in perfect harmony and friendship; had he thought it improper, he would have signified his disapproabation both to the king in his report, and to myself. The only privateers we manned were the Lemon ad∣vice boat, or Xavagor, and the General Mur∣ray privateer; they were upon all occasions ready to execute my commands, and to be sent to Gibraltar or any part of the Mediterranean, to collect my intelligence, and keep our commu∣nication with Italy.</P>
<P>The vessels, and I believe the arms, were the property of individuals; I declare upon my ho∣nour I had no share in them, or any other pri∣vateer, further than as follows:</P>
<P>When it was expedient to employ the General Murray, as I have expressed, and there was a difficulty to find adventurers to purchase and fit out the ship, I asked Sir William Draper if he would not take a share in her, he replied he had not money to spare; I then deposited 1000 dollars in the name of Sir William Draper's two daughters; and Mr. M'Neille, and Mr. Case, know that every formality of law was done in investing them with the property, and putting it out of my power to claim a shilling had she taken prizes: This ship was sunk, and paid for; Mr. Case returned me the 1000 dollars in Janu∣ary, which I received without attempting to force a favour on Sir William, that might have exposed me to insult.</P>
<P>As our garrison daily grew weaker, and I was told it was impossible to reinforce it from England; it became my duty to secure for our defence as many English seamen as I could; with that view I agreed to victual and pay the men of the Hannah, a privateer from England, and those of the Eagle, one from Scotland, and which was only about three weeks, provided they would stick by us, and throw their crews into the fort in case of its being attacked; they both fulfilled their agreement, and I appeal to the court, if this can be called embezzling or misapplying the public stores: if I had any shares in those privateers, it would not have been with∣out a president. Lord <HI>Winchester,</HI> when at the head of the admiralty, was a principal owner in two privateers; but besides the right of hold∣ing a share, those vessels became absolutely ne∣cessary for our protection.</P>
<P>The Generals Wolfe, Moncton, Lord Townsend, and myself, at the desire of Admi∣ral Saunders, purchased a vessel which was armed and victualled by the stores and ammuni∣tion of the fleet, and none of us thought we had done wrong, till the vessel was cast away, and we had lost our money.</P>
<P>The evidence of Lieutenant Case, and the questions put by Sir William Draper on this subject, evidently shew the dispositions of jea∣lousy and discontent which were prevalent in Sir William Draper's mind, when I conceived the strictest harmony to have subsisted between us; and this will account for his subsequent conduct, when those passions broke out with such violences.</P>
<P>Before I finish this article, I must remark, though it is not applicable to the charge, that Captain <HI>Stewison</HI> has declared in his evidence, that having sailed with dispatches, he purposely returned to communicate to me some intelligence respecting the sailing of the enemy's fleet; I shall prove that he returned an account of a mutiny against him, and I declare if he brought any such intelligence, it was so perfectly vague, that it was not even reported to me, or made any impression upon any of the garrison.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Fourth.</HI></P>
<P>At the time the Hannah privateer (which came into the harbour after the blockade) was bought by the inaction of the enemy, none of whose motions could yet be perceived, a block∣ade was to be expected; it became my duty, being authorised by his Majesty to do every thing which I thought proper for the defence of the place, to purchase in to the service of government, a vessel of force, which might carry any dis∣patches to and from the Continent, and bring such recruits as could be raised in Italy for the assistance of the garrison; so necessary was this found, that two other vessels were afterwards pur∣chased by his Majesty's ministers at Florence; for the same purpose by orders from government, the Hannah was purchased by a valuation of ho∣nest men, as will be seen by their report, and at a much cheaper rate than either of the vessels abovementioned; she has since that been com∣missioned by the admiralty, and a lieutenant ap∣pointed to command her, and, with the other two, has been employed since the surrender of Minorca, in carrying refreshments and recruits to the garrison of Gibraltar, and is now arrived at <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> The only objection which my accuser has been able to state against this measure, is that another vessel, the St. Antonio Depadua, might have been hired at a cheaper rate than the purchase of the Hannah, but it has appeared by the evidence, that he was by no means equally fit for the purpose; and as the Hannah was intended for, and has been since employed in a variety of services,
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>her being purchased at that time has been a very considerable saving to government.</P>
<P>D. <HI>Charge the Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>When the garrison was invested, the num∣ber of officers of the several ranks were inade∣quate to the duty, though I rendered it as easy as could be, consistent with the safety of the place, as will appear by the roster of the four regiments who did duty as one corps.</P>
<P>Captain Lawson, of his Majesty's sloop Mi∣norca, was, by the embodying of the marine corps, raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the garrison; he, from that rank, disputed the authority of the commanding officer of artillery, to whom the marine corps were to be assistant. It became necessary to raise that officer (whose commission, as major, preceded that of captain Lawson's, as master and commander,) to a su∣perior rank, and this promotion naturally car∣ried with it those of three elder majors in the garrison; before that time a colonel being thought necessary to command the <HI>British</HI> inner line, lieutenant-colonel Acklom had the tem∣porary rank given him for that purpose; colo∣nel Brewse's getting the rank, he being an elder officer, was of consequence; Majors de Gruben, and de Backar, being sick, two others were appointed to that rank, to command the Hanoverian line.</P>
<P>Thus the promotions in the garrison are ac∣counted for; but had no such necessity subsisted, (authorized as I have shewn I then was) there was no method more likely to encourage the exertions of the officers of the garrison, than by giving the eldest of each rank a temporary promotion, which, if the defence was glorious and successful, they had reason to hope would be confirmed by his Majesty.</P>
<P>And it was certainly better to pay those offi∣cers for the rank in which they had acted, than to allow that money to fall into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>E. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>The whole of this transaction appears in my letter to Mr. Robinson, and the papers there∣with transmitted. Had not the guineas been established at 24 pistereens, the island would, in a short time, have been destitute of circula∣ting specie; I am confident it was no detriment to the troops or inhabitants, nor did I ever hear that either officer or soldier found fault with it: the guinea continues to pass for the same, not only at Mahon but at Majorca; I could reap no advantage from it, government alone was the gainer. All the public accounts are made up in dollars, and government was credited 24 pistereens for the guinea, as will be seen by my warrant to the master, and the quarter-master general's accounts.</P>
<P>The accuser errs in asserting that a guinea was ordered to pass for 24 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> and this is another instance of that wonderful stretch of fancy, when I am to be accused; for 24 pistereens are at an average, no more than 1 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and one fifth. This matter which I conceived, after the best advice and consideration, to be a neces∣sary and proper regulation for preventing that drain of specie, which the merchants were in∣duced to make, having been referred to the lords of the treasury, it was for their lordship's to correct the measure, if they judged it im∣proper.</P>
<P>It is singularly hard that this should be made a charge, with the exaggeration, that the offi∣cers and soldiers were hurt by it; when it cer∣tainly prevented the rise of the exchange upon the officers, who were obliged to draw on Eng∣land for their subsistence. I shall desire the pay∣master may be examined, to declare how much pains I took on all occasions to accommodate the officers, and lower the exchange; and this, among other reasons, was a cause of issuing the proclamation in question, to oblige the mer∣chants to covet bills rather than specie.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the First.</HI></P>
<P>Since the treaty of Utrecht, the Minorquins have not been intitled to bear arms. They were disarmed upon the first taking the island, and af∣terwards by general Kayne, general Wynwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and lord Blakeny.</P>
<P>By the eleventh article of the governor's in∣structions, the governor has authority, if he judges it necessary, to disarm the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In March 1780, having had information that flat bottom boats were building at Barcelona, Carthagena, &amp;c. and an attack designed to be made upon the island in the spring, and having made repeated trials whether the inhabitants would defend the island against the enemy, and found that they were in no wise disposed so to do: the inhabitants of Cuitadella, it is true, in the year 1778, applied for a reinforcement to defend them against the enemy's privateers; and I had sent them an officer, drummer and twelve men, and four pieces of cannon, &amp;c. and re∣commended it to them to raise 57 men for the defence of their own town, in the nature of a militia, under all proper encouragement, to be commanded by Don Pasqueda; and though I issued a proclamation for that purpose, and af∣terwards enforced it by my letter of the 11th of September following, and offered, that in case there was any objection to Don Pasqueda, that
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>I would approve their choice of another; yet this little corps could never be raised in the principal town in the island. It is true Don Pasqueda got about 30 men of the 57, but even they, in April 1780, refused to obey orders and deserted.</P>
<P>I had likewise proposed the raising a Minor∣quin corps of 500 men, to serve in case of in∣vasion, who were not to be employed out of the island, intimating that those who were not en∣gaged in support of this corps would be de∣prived of their arms.</P>
<P>The Dons made many difficulties to carry this proposal into execution, and nothing was done therein.</P>
<P>Another proposal was set on foot on the 26th of April, 1778; and on the 2d of May, 1778, a proclamation was issued by me for raising a corps of 500 artificers, bakers, &amp;c. to go into the works in case the place was besieged; which, on the 25th of February, 1779, I informed by another proclamation, issued for the same pur∣pose, with all fitting encouragement.</P>
<P>On the 2d of August, 1779, I made fresh propositions to raise a corps of workmen, and</P>
<P>On the 3d of August following, I issued a proclamation in consequence.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September following, Don Pasqueda wrote me word, that not one person had offered his service, and that it would be impossible to raise this corps, from the great disinclination of the Minorquins had to enter into his majesty's service.</P>
<P>From the unwillingness of the inhabitants to take arms, and the circumstances of the war with Spain, to which nation the inhabitants strongly retained their attachment, and know∣ing the influence that their <HI>priests</HI> had over them, and finding that they encouraged and secreted the deserters in spite of all I could do to have them delivered up, notwithstanding my repeated proclamation, issued 18th July, 1778, and 24th December, 1779, with the advice and under the authority of the civil magistrates, two of which deserters have been secreted above two years in the island: and finding, that not∣withstanding my repeated orders and remon∣strances, from the beginning of the war to that time, they, to distress the garrison, had with∣held the usual and necessary supplies of wood, without which they well knew the garrison, if besieged, could not exist: I thought it pru∣dent, and hope the Court will think it was ne∣cessary, to disarm them; and the method I took for that purpose, was to make use of the pretence of searching for the deserters, and which was favoured by my having received infor∣mation in December 1779, that the two deser∣ters who had been so long secreted, were seen in the island; but that no formalities might be wanted, I first directed an officer under the bailiff of Mahon to search for them.</P>
<P>I issued a proclamation, forbidding all persons to give aid, assistance, or advice to deserters, and to give information under penalties.</P>
<P>I caused a circular letter to be wrote to all the universities, that I intended to send out a party of 200 English seamen to search for the deserters, recommending them to call together the country people, and giving them eight days further time.</P>
<P>The orders for making a general search for the deserters were issued, and the civil officers directed to attend.</P>
<P>The next day warrants, sealed up, were issued to the commanding officers, commanding the corps that were to make the search, to execute those orders on the 3d of February, and to dis∣arm the individuals of their fire arms; at the same time, taking lists of the arms, and to lodge them safely, which was done.</P>
<P>Not having intended that the small swords should be taken away, on the 9th of February, 1780, I ordered them to be returned to the in∣habitants, which were taken by mistake, and the same day I recalled the troops; and on Fe∣bruary the 12th, I wrote to the Dons and prin∣cipal inhabitants of Cuitadella in the politest terms, that I was extremely sorry to find that they had been deprived of their swords, entirely owing to my order being misunderstood; and on the 19th of February, 1779, I ordered both fusees and swords to be returned to the principal inhabitants of Cuitadella; and the same day complaints having been made of damage done to individuals by the sailors, I ordered enquiries to be made, and the depositions of all who had any complaints to be taken.</P>
<P>I issued another proclamation for all persons that had received damage to give in their com∣plaints, that they might receive ample justice.</P>
<P>I issued another proclamation, which men∣tioned that only eight persons had complained of injuries, and limiting the time to twelve days from that day.</P>
<P>And the inhabitants of Merixdal, having de∣livered an account of their damages, were re∣imbursed to the amount of about 500 dollars.</P>
<P>Whatever opinion mankind might have formed of the act of disarming, at the moment when no danger was pressing, and where humanity naturally inclined against every act of severity upon a contingent event, and where no respon∣sibility lay with the persons expressing their opinions; yet as the faithless conduct of the Minorquins had since appeared so conspicuous after the landing of the enemy, I thought all Englishmen had never been unanimous in ap∣plauding the property of the measure. My accuser to this charge might have been short; I had the power, and I judged it necessary to examine it; but in an act like this, which was affecting to so many individuals under my government, I wished to shew that I had not
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>used any discretional authority wantonly or op∣pressively. In one charge I am accused of carelessness; in this my vigilance is turned into a crime.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the Second.</HI></P>
<P>As I was passing through the main ditch, accompanied by Lieutenant Douglas, my aid de camp, I saw a considerable number of the Spanish prisoners standing without the door of their places of confinement, their numbers were about 80; they had only one centry over them, and the arms of the guard were about 20 paces from them, piled against the side of the ditch. It is true, that vexed to see them in that situa∣tion, I ordered them with some warmth into their place of confinement; which not being immediately obeyed, I forced them in, and touched one or two of them in the manner which has been described to the court. In the then state of my health, any strokes of mine could be but of little consequence. Let the faculty and the Prevost Marshal be examined, whether the utmost humanity was not shewn, and the greatest attention paid by me to the health of the prisoners.</P>
<P>It were well for my accuser, after having the fact from his own witness, if he can recollect the person who had represented to him my con∣duct in this affair, that he may be induced never to believe him again.</P>
<P>F. <HI>Charge the Third.</HI></P>
<P>Joseph Gaya came into the fort with my pro∣mise, that if we were driven out of the island I would procure him an employment in England, equal to what he enjoyed in Minorca.</P>
<P>His going every day at 12 o'clock to the top of the castle, and some things being seen there that had the appearance of signals to the enemy, by placing stones on the parapet in particular figures, which was answered from the Philipet. This gave the first cause of suspicion, which was confirmed by a report of the Prevost-Mar∣tial, who stated that Gaya lived constantly with Joseph Sara, a Minorquin prisoner in the Castle Square; and that contrary to my orders, he carried that Sara several times about the fort with him.</P>
<P>I therefore thought it necessary to confine him, as from his being perfectly acquainted with every part of the garrison, as he might have been materially detrimental to me if he had made his escape, which it would have been impossible to prevent, if he had been left at large.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Douglass went to him at my de∣sire, to acquaint him that he was only confined upon suspicion, and that if nothing was proved against him on our going out of the fort, either being driven out of it on the siege being raised, he might depend on the performance of my promise, that in the mean time his pay should be continued to him, and he should be sed out of my kitchen, should have the liberty of walk∣ing twice in the day on the top of the castle, under charge of one of my orderly serjeants, for the sake of his health. His destroying him∣self could therefore only be occasioned by his being conscious of his guilt, of which indeed there is the strongest presumption; a plan of the works having been found in his trunk, as appears by the evidence of Mr. Prevost Marshal. Mr. Potter, has declared that he has been since informed of Gaya's having actually given intelligence to the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Sir George Howard, and the General Officers of the Court Martial.</HI></P>
<P>I have finished the evidence, which I have thought necessary to call in my defence; and, as far as I am capable of judging in my own cause, there is nothing which now remains to be cleared up, in order to enable the court to pass that sentence which their justice and their wisdom shall direct, except with regard to the following particulars.</P>
<P>In my answer to the first article of the charge A, I assert, that I could not be surprized, and in a letter to Lord Barrington the Secretary of War, in the year 1776, requesting barracks might be built in the fort for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he troops, which letter I have produced in evidence; I say, no place, <Q>I ever saw is more liable to be “”surprised than Fort St. Philip's.</Q> Now it has been alledged, with an eager precipitation, by my accuser, that in these two assertions there is an evident contradiction but if the court will be pleased to attend to the time of the year, (viz.) the winter month February 1780, stated in the charge, they will find there is no contradiction whatever when the two assertions are considered with a reference to that period.</P>
<P>I admit we were liable to a possible suprise in the summer, by flat boats or row gallies from Barcelona and Majorca; but I deny that we were so in February, 1780; when such vessels could not venture to carry troops in those seas; and I had at that time, as I have already ob∣served, particular intelligence that there were no preparations in readiness at these places for such an enterprise; but whenever I thought a surprise was possible, I went into the fort my∣self, with all the officers, namely, in the end of March and beginning of April of that very year, as has been proved to the court.</P>
<P>I must remark, that there has appeared to the court a difference between a return of the 51st regiment, dated the 1st of February, 1782, and sent by Colonel Pringle to the Adjutant-General, accompanied with a note of com∣plaint, that the regiment could not relieve the guards (which note and return have both been authenticated by Colonel Pringle) and and another return of the said regiment pro∣duced in evidence by Colonel Pringle, which was made to him by his own directions at Al∣layor
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>a few days after the surrender, by which the regiment appears to be stronger.</P>
<P>The only observation I shall make to this point is, that the physician general, and the adjutant of the 51st regiment have both prov∣ed to the court, that from the 1st of February, until the surrender, there were above 40 men of that regiment obliged by sickness to go into the hospitals; and therefore the difference of these two returns must have arisen from some mistake of colonel Pringle's.</P>
<P>It has appeared that Mr. Bayne, the aucti∣oneer, made a mistake against himself in the ac∣count he delivered to Sir William Draper, by giving credit for about 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for goods sold by him, which were not prize goods. This mis∣take I declare escaped me, because I never ex∣amined that account; if I had, I certainly would have corrected the error, having no right, as vice-admiral, to any thing but the moiety of the one and a half per cent. upon the sale of prize goods taken from the enemy.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper having failed to prove his assertion that I was an adventurer in the priva∣teers, has attempted to insinuate that the [vice-admiral's f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the sale of the prizes, made me concerned in them, he may with as much reason say, I contributed to sit out, man, and victual his Majesty's ships of war, which con∣demned and sold their prizes at Minorca, as they likewise paid the one and a half per cent. to the auctioneer.</P>
<P>The court have before them what things were left to be executed by Sir William Draper, when I gave him the temporary command of the fort; and what part of these things were executed by him; they are to decide whether it would not have been of more utility to have carried these into execution, than to have made barbet batteries, which were not once fired after the enemy open∣ed their batteries, and few of them before. To make these barbets at the salliant angles of the inner covered way, the glacis was lowered, and the adjoining branches of the covered way ren∣dered untenable, even if we had had troops to defend them. The chief engineer is the best judge if this was proper, or otherwise.</P>
<P>It is laid to my charge that none of the mines had been sprung before the surrender, the court are the best judges; it has been already proved by Colonel Brewse that if they had been sprung at that time, they could have done no harm to the enemy. It was always my opinion, that the only time for springing the mines under the outward glacis, was when the enemy were making the assault on the Lunettes, then the enemy's troops, who were immediately engaged in the storm, confounded and discouraged by the explosion behind them, would naturally have supposed that those destined to support them were destroyed by it. Had they even re∣covered that confusion they could scarcely have escaped an unavoidable destruction from the blowing up of the Lunettes; and if even that had failed, their advantage (from the galleries of communication being mined) could have only extended to the work of which they had got possession. These, with many other resources, are what I meant in my report to his Majesty, by defending the place by chicanes; let me fall or stand by the justice of these ideas, I hazard them to the court, and I hazard them to all Europe.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned that the officers of the four regular regiments were in much better health than the private men; this is easily ac∣counted for, the soldiers had all of them, (viz.) the British, for eleven years, lived on salt pro∣visions. The quantity of vegetables they con∣sumed, and the wine they drank, though it prevented the immediate effect of the scurvy, could not hinder it from tainting the blood. The officers had, until we were invested, lived intirely on fresh provisions, and even after that we were confined to the fort, had wine, and other refreshments bought at their own expence. They likewise passed the day in the quarters of the castle square, and were only in the night confined to the damp air of the Souderreins; but even the officers, with all those advantages, began to be infected.</P>
<P>It has been asked, whether fire balls were used in the defence, and proved they were, but they were only employed when they could be useful. They could not be thrown at the distance of seven or eight hundred yards; the enemy's batteries were at that distance from us; a fire ball must go beyond the object to discover it, of course those thrown by us could not di∣rect our fire upon the enemy's batteries, but even if we could have thrown them so far, it would have been of no service, as they must have been lost in the hollows, which were just behind these batteries; such as we threw were intended to discover the enemy's engineers, marking out their intended approaches, or the parties they frequently sent to fire upon our out∣works, and to assure our men that nothing could advance upon us without discovery: we had originally but one hundred carcases, some of them were expended in our attempts to de∣stroy the burgos battery of the enemy, the rest were reserved for a more important stage of the siege, if the Almighty had permitted us to dis∣pute our ground.</P>
<P>All Europe will read this trial; the reputation of the British arms will be much affected by the event of it; I must not, in fear of any man, or any consequences, neglect laying open every circumstance to the world, by which mankind may judge of our knowledge in the art of war, and of the fundamental principles of our disci∣pline and subordination. We certainly are not in the state of Carthage, when every military
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>commander was disgraced because he could not perform impossibilities.</P>
<P>Let the then ministry account for leaving me with 1400 regular privates, worn out men, to defend a fortress which required at least 4000 s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out able soldiers; this I always thought they could do, because they were pressed to supply more important objects: but let not me be blamed because I was lest a forlorn hope, and did the best I could; let not the brave officers and men who exerted themselves on the occasion, be blasted with ignominy, because we could not per∣form miracles; I had not the powers of Deu∣calion; God deprived them of the exertions of Hercules.</P>
<P>As to the tedious history of the value I put upon the guinea, let the Court and the world judge whether I did not do my duty in that re∣spect; let both determine what the treasury means by acquiescence, when they do not chuse to take upon themselves the responsi∣bility.</P>
<P>Sir William Draper has endeavoured to vin∣dicate his conduct towards me, on my order of the 15th of October, for restraining useless siring; but until I was informed by the adju∣tant general, captain Don, of his indecent and unsoldier-like behaviour, upon my message of the 11th of November, and that he had quoted this order of the 15th as the cause for such ex∣traordinary conduct, I had always been made to believe, that the shyness which he had shewn to me had arisen from some ill grounded jealousy he had conceived, because I had not consulted with him respecting our sally upon Cape Moloa, on the 11th of October; but whether it arose from the one cause or the other is immaterial to in∣vestigate, since no commander in chief was ever yet held bound to consult an inferior officer, upon the orders he may think proper to issue; he alone is responsible for their expediency, and if any subordinate officer is permitted with im∣punity to make the ordinary exercise of military command, a pretext for reviling his superior, charged with the defence of a fortress besieged by the enemy, thereby endangering the consi∣dence the troops should, more especially at that juncture, repose in the governor, there is an end from that moment of all the discipline of the service: but if after such contemptuous be∣haviour in an inferior officer, he should find any professional countenance in attempting to vindicate himself, by heaping together a num∣ber of groundless charges against his command∣ing officer, few men of reputation will be hence forward ambitious of serving in the army.</P>
<P>I confess I erred in not putting the lieutenant governor under an arrest, when I received his second letter of the 16th January 1782; but I hope that error will be forgiven, when every circumstance under which I acted is considere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more especially when I declare, that I acted from the conviction that Sir William Draper's private resentment against me, was so unmerited that it could have no tendency to diminish the zeal and spirit of the garrison, in the defence of the place, or to weaken that subordination, which nothing personal can ever produce in the breast of a good soldier.</P>
<P>I am afraid these remarks may appear tedious to the Court, who have already lent me so much of their patience, but I trust they will make a favourable allowance for the anxiety of an old soldier, in wiping away every stain from his character, after such a series of trying service as I have endured, without the slightest impeach∣ment of my military conduct.</P>
<P>I now take my final leave of the Court, and whatever may be your judgment, I shall bear a willing and grateful testimony to your fair, can∣did, patient, and impartial proceedings; I have no complaint to make of any part of them, or any thing but sincere thanks to offer: but if I was of a disposition to complain of my accuser, I might perhaps indulge it with less imputation upon either fortitude or moderation, than any other man, military or civil, that ever stood be∣fore the judges of his country.</P>
<P>The siege of Fort St. Philip's, without hope of relief, under the difficulties which have ap∣peared to the court; the anxious reflection that it most probably was the last military exertion of my life, and the necessity of surrendering the fort under such a reflection, was surely in itself a sufficient measure of misfortune, with∣out the addition of the stain of public accusal, and the painful proceedings of a public trial. But there is something here, that tells me rather to rejoice, than to complain, since it is from this last circumstance of a public trial, that all my misfortunes can be dispelled, and done away; the time is now come, when I look up to your justice, to enable n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to appear before my coun∣try with an unimpeachable testimony, that I did not surrender, while there was any means of re∣sistance, and that I was not undeserving the commission with which I was honoured by my most gracious Sovereign.</P>
