<P><HI>THE High and Lofty One who

with him that is of humble and
contrite heart</HI> In the midst of
his glory, the Almighty is not inattentive
to the meanest of his subjects. Neither
obscurity of station, nor imperfection of
knowledge, sink those below his regard,
who worship and obey him. Every prayer
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
which they send up from their secret re∣tirement,
is listened to by him; and every
work of charity which they perform, how
unknow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver to the world, attracts his
notice. The text persent, a signal instance
of this comfortable truth. In the city of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Roman centurion,
a military officer of inferior rank, a Gen∣tile,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by birth nor religion entitled
to the privileges of the Jewish nation. But
he was a devout and benevolent man;
who, according to his measure of religious
knowledge, studied to perform his duty,
<HI>prayed to God always, and gave much alms
to the people.</HI> Such a character passed not
unobserved, thy God. So highly was it
honoured, that to this good centurion an
angel was sent from heaven, in order to
direct him to the means of full instruction
in the truth. The angel accsts him with
this salutation, <HI>Cornelius, Thy prayers and
thine alms are come up for a memorial before
god.</HI></P>
<P>It is to the conjunction of <HI>prayers and
alsm</HI> that I purpose now to direct your
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
thoughts, as deslxzcribing the respectable
and amiable character of a man, as form∣ing
the honour and the blessedness of a
true Christian; piety joined with charity,
faith with good works, devotion with mo∣rality.
These arc things which God hath
connected, and which it is impious in man
to separate. It is only when they remain
united, that they can come up as a grate∣ful
<HI>memorial before God</HI> I shall first endea∣vour
to show you, That alms without
prayers, or prayers without alms, mora∣lity
without devotion, or devotion without
morality, arc extremely defective; and
then shall point out the happy effects of
their mutual union.</P>
<P>LET us begin with considering the case
of alms without prayers; that is, of good
works without piety, or a proper sense of
God and Religion. This is no rare nor
uncommon case. With many, Virtue is,
or at least is pretended to be, a respectable
and an honoured name, while Piety
sounds meanly in their ears. They are
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
men of the world, and they claim to be
men of honour. They rest upon their
humanity, their public spirit, their pro∣bity,
and their truth. They arrogate to
themselves all the manly and the active
virtues. But devout affections and reli∣gious
duties they treat with contempt, as
founded on shadowy speculations, and fit
to employ the attention only of weak and
superstitious minds. Now, in opposition
to such persons, I contend, that this ne∣glect
of piety argues depravity of heart;
and that it infers an irregular discharge
of the duties of morality.</P>
<P>FIRST, It argues internal depravity; it
discovers a cold and a hard heart, which
can never be a good one. If there be any
impression which man is formed by na∣ture
to receive, it is a sense of religion.
As soon as his mind opens to observation
and reflection, he discerns innumerable
marks of his dependent state. He finds
himself placed, by some superior power,
in a vast world, where the wisdom and
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
goodness of the Creator are conspicuous
on every side. The magnificence, the
beauty and order of nature, excite him to
admire and adore. When he looks up
to that invisible hand which operates
throughout the universe, he is impressed
with reverence. When he receives bles∣sings
which he cannot avoid ascribing to
divine goodness, he is prompted to grati∣tude.
The expressions of those affections
under the various forms of religious wor∣ship,
are no other than native effsions of
the human heart. Ignorance may mis∣lead,
and superstition corrupt them; but
their origin is derived from sentiments
that are essential to man.</P>
<P>Casl your eyes over the whole earth.
Explore the most remote quarters of die
east or the west. You may discover tribes
of men without policy, or laws, or cities,
or any of the arts of life: But no where
(shall you find them without some form
of religion. In every region you behold
the prostrate worshipper, the temple, and
the offering. Wherever men have existed,
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
they have been sensible that some acknow∣ledgment
was due on their part, to the
Former of the world. If in their rudest
and most ignorant state, this obligation
has been confessed, how much is it in∣creased
by the improvements of human
knowledge, but especially by the great
discoveries of the Christian revelation?
Whatever, either from reverence or from
gratitude, can excite mew to the worship of
God, is by this revelation placed in such
a light as one should think were sufficient
to over-awe the most thoughtless, and to
melt the most obdurate mind.</P>
<P>Canst thou, then, pretend to be a man
of reason, nay, a man of virtue, and yet
continue regardless of one of the first and
chief dictates of human nature? Where
is thy sensibility to what is right and fit,
if that loud voice which calls all nations
throughout the earth to religious homage,
has never been heard by thee? Or, if it
has been heard, by what strange and
false refinements hast thou stifled those
natural sentiments which it tends to a∣waken?
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
Calling thyself a son, a citizen,
a friend; claiming to be faithful and af∣fectionate
in these relations; hast thou
no sense of what thou owest to thy first
Parent, thy highest Sovereign, thy great∣est
Benefactor? Can it be constinent with
true virtue or honour, to value thyself up∣on
thy regard to inferior obligations, and
yet to violate that which is the most sacred
and the most ancient of all? When simple
instinct teaches the Tartar and the Indian,
together with his alms and good works
to join his prayers to that Power whom
he considers as the source of good, shall
it be no reproach, in the most enlightened
state of human nature, and under the
purest dispensation of religion, to have
extinguished the sense of gratitude to Hea∣ven,
and to slight all acknowledgment of
the great and the true God? What does
such conduct imply, but either an entire
want, or a wilful suppression of some of
the best and most generous affections be∣longing
to human nature?—Surely, there
must be an essential defect in that heart
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
which remains cold and insensible, where
it ought to be affected most warmly.
Surely, such a degree of depravity must
be lodged there, as is sufficient to taint
all die other springs of pretended virtue.</P>
<P>BUT besides this, I must contend, in
the <HI>second</HI> place, That where religion is
neglected, there can be no regular nor
steady practice of the duties of morality.
The character, will be often inconsistent;
and Virtue placed on a basis too narrow to
support it, will be always loose and tot∣tering.
For such is the propensity of our
nature to vice, so numerous are the tempt∣ations
to a relaxed and immoral conduct,
that stronger restraints than those of mere
reason are necessary to be imposed on
man. The sense of right and wrong, the
principle of honour, or the instinct of be∣nevolence,
are barriers too feeble to with∣stand
the strength of passon. In the
tranquil seasons of life, these natural prin∣ciples
may, perhaps, carry on the ordi∣nary
course of social duties with some re∣gularity.
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
But wait until some trying
emergence come. Let the conflict of pas∣sions
arise. Let the heart be either wound∣ed
by sore distress, or agitated by violent
emotions; and you shall presently see that
virtue without religion is inadequate to
the government of life. It is destitute of
its proper guard, of its firmest support,
of its chief encouragement. It will sink
tinder the weight of misfortune; or will
yield to the solicitation of guilt.</P>
<P>The great motives that produce con∣stancv
and firmness of action must be of
a palpable and striking kind: A Divine
Legislator uttering his voice from heaven;
an Omniscient Witness beholding us in
all our retreats; an Almighty Governour
stretching forth his arm to punish or re∣ward,
disclosing the secrets of the invisible
world, informing us of perpetual rest
prepared hereafter for the righteous, and
everlasting sorrows for the wicked: These
are the considerations which over-awe the
world, which support integrity and check
guilt. They add to virtue that solemnity
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
which should ever characterize it. To
the admonitions of conscience they give
the authority of a law. Co-operating
with all the good dispositions of a pious
man, they strengthen and insure their in∣sluence.
On his alms you can have no
certain dependence, who thinks not of
God, nor has ever joined prayer to his
charitable deeds. But when humanity is
seconded by piety, the spring from which
it flows is rendered, of course, more re∣gular
and constant.—In short, withdraw
religion, and you shake all the pillars of
morality. In every heart you weaken the
influence of virtue: And among the mul∣titude,
the bulk of mankind, you over∣throw
its power.</P>
<P>HAVING thus shewn that morality
without devotion is both defective and
unstable, I proceed to consider the other
extreme, of prayers without alms, devo∣tion
without morality.</P>
<P>In every age the practice has prevailed,
of substituting certain appearances of piety
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
in the place of the great duties of huma∣nity
and mercy. Too many there have
always been who flatter themselves with
the hope of obtaining the friendship of
their Creator, though they neglect to do
justice to their fellow-creatures. But such
persons may be assured, that their suppos∣ed
piety is altogether of a spurious kind.
It is an invention of their own, unknown
to reason, unknown in the word of God.
In scripture we are ever directed to try
our faith by our works, our love of God
by our love of men. We are directed to
consider piety as a principle which rege∣nerates
the heart, and forms it to good∣ness.
We are taught that in vain we ad-dress
any acts of homage to Christ, un∣less
we <HI>do the things which he saith;</HI> and
that <HI>love, peace, gentlenessy goodness, meek∣ness</HI>
and <HI>temperance, are</HI> not only the in∣junctions
of his law, but the native <HI>fruits
of his spirit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 46. Gal. V. 22.</NOTE>. If therefore while piety seems ardent, morality shall decline, you have
full reason to believe that into that piety
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
some corrupting ingredients have entered.
And if ever your regard to morality shall
totally fail; if, while you make many
prayers, you give no alms; if, while you
appear to be zealous for God, you are
false or unjust to men; if you arc hard or
contracted in heart, severe in your cen∣sures,
and oppressive in your conduct;
then, conclude with certainty, that what
you had termed piety was no more than
an empty name. For as soon, according
to the scripture similitude, will <HI>bitter wa∣ters
flow from a sweet fountain</HI> or thistles
become the fruit of the vine, as such ef∣fects
be produced by genuine piety.</P>
<P>What you have called by that name,
resblves itself into one or other of three
things. Either it is a hypocritical form
of godliness, assumed in order to impose
on. the world; or, which is the most fa∣vourable
supposition, it is a transient im∣pression
of seriousness, an accidental melt∣ing
of the heart, which <HI>passes away like
the morning cloud and the early dew;</HI> or,
which I am afraid is too often the case,
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
it is the deliberate refuge of a deluded and
superstitious, but at the same time a cor∣rupted
mind. For all men, even the most
depraved, are subject, more or less, to
compunctions of conscience. It has never
been in their power to withdraw totally
beyond the reach of that warning voice,
which tells them that soemthing is neces∣sary
to be done, in order to make their
peace with the Ruler of the world. But,
backward at the same time to resign the
gains of dishonesty, or the pleasures of vice,
a verse from submission to that sacred law
which enjoins reghteousness in its whole
extent, they have often attempted to make
a sort of composition with Heaven; a com∣position,
which, though they dare not a∣vow
it words, lurks in secret, at the bot∣tom
of many a heart. If God will only
dispense with some articles of obedience,
they will repay him with abundant ho∣mage:
If they fail in good practice, they
will study to be sound in belief; and, by
the number of their prayers, will atone,
in some measure, for their deficiency in
charitable deeds.
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
But the attempt is as vain, as it is im∣pious.
From the simplest and plainest
principles of reason it must appear, that
religious worship, disjoined from justice
and virtue, can upon no account what∣ever
find acceptance with God. <HI>To what
purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices un∣to
me? saith the Lord. Brings no more vain
oblations. Incense is an abomination unto me.
The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; if is iniqui∣ty,
even the solemn meeting</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ifa. i. II, 14.</NOTE>.—Cease, foolish
and impious man! Cease to consider the
Almighty as a weak or vain-glorious be∣ing,
who is to be appeased by thy devout
prostrations and thy humble -words; or
to be gratified by the parade and ostenta∣tion
of external worship. What is all thy
worship to him? <HI>Will he eat the flesh of
thy sacrifices, or drink the blood of offered
goats?</HI> Was worship required of thee,
dost thou think, upon his account, that
thou mightest bring any increase to his
glory and felicity by thy weak and insig∣nificant
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
praises? Sooner mightest thou
increase the splendor of the sun by a
lighted taper, or add to the thunder by
thy voice. No: It is for the sake of man,
not of God, that worship and prayers are
required; not that God may be rendered
more glorious, but that man may be made
better; that he may be confirmed in a
proper sense of his dependent state, and
acquire those pious and virtuous disposi∣tions
by which he draws near to God.</P>
<P>Of all the principles in religion, one
should take this to be the most evident;
and yet, frequent admonitions are needed
to renew the impression of it upon man∣kind.
For what purpose did God place
thee in this world, in the midst of human
society, but that as a man among men
thou mightest cultivate humanity; that
each in his place might contribute to the
general welfare; that as a spouse, a bro∣ther,
a son, or a friend, thou mightest act
thy part with an upright and a tender
heart; and thus aspire to resemble Him
who ever consults the good of his crea∣tures,
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
and whose <HI>tender mercies are over
all his works?</HI> And darest thou, who
hast been sacrificing unsuspicious inno∣cence
to thy loose pleasures; thou, who
hast been disturbing the repose of society
by thine ambition or craft; thou, who, to
increase thy treasures, hast been making
the widow and the orphan weep; darest
thou approach God with thy worship and
thy prayers, and entertain the hope that
upon thee he will look down in peace?
Will the God of order and justice accept
such poor compensation for his violated
laws? Will the God of love regard the
services of one who is an enemy to his
creatures? Shall a corrupter of the society
of men aspire to the habitations of God?
—Believe it, <HI>He that saith he loveth God,
must love hit brother also. Cease to do evil;
learn to do well. Seek judgment; relieve
the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for
the widow:</HI> And then, <HI>Draw nigh to God,
and he will draw nigh to thee; call upon
him in the day of trouble, and he will answer
thee.</HI> Thy prayers and thine alms shall
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
then ascend, in joint memorial, before
the Most High.</P>
<P>I HAVE now shown the evil of maim∣ing
and splitting religion; of dividing
asunder two things, which though in
theory they may be separated, yet in
practice must always co-exist if either of
them be real, Devotion to God, and Cha∣rity
to men. Let us consider next the
happy effects of their union.</P>
<P>Their union forms the consistent, the
graceful, the respectable character of the
real Christrian, the man of true worth. If
you leave either of them out of your sy∣stem,
even though you excel in the other,
you can stand trial only in one point of
view. It is only on one side your cha∣racter
is fair; on the other, it will always
be open to much reproach. And as you
dishonour yourselves, so you do great in∣justice
to religion. For by dividing its
parts from one another, you never fail to
expose it to the censure of the world:
And perhaps, by this sort of partial and
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
divided goodness, religion has suffered
more in the esteem of mankind, than by
open profligacy. The unbeliever will
scoff at your piety, when he sees you ne∣gligent
of moral duties. The bigot will
run down all morality, when he sees you
pretending to be a follower of virtue,
though you be a despiser of God. Where∣as
he who fears God, and is at the same
time just and beneficent to men, exhibits
religion to the world with full propriety.
It thines in his conduct with its native
splendor; and its rays throw a glory
round him. His character is above re∣proach.
It is at once amiable and vene∣rable.
Malice itself is afraid to attack
him; and even the worst men respect
and honour him in their hearts.</P>
<P>This too is the man whose life will be
most peaceful and happy. He who fails
materially either in piety or in virtue, is
always obnoxious to the anguish of re∣morse.
His partial goodness may flatter
him in the day of superficial observation;
but when solitude or distress awakens the
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
powers of reflection, he shall be made to
feel, that one part of duty performed
atones not for another which is neglected.
In the midst of his prayers the remem∣brance
of injustice will upbraid him with
hypocrisy; and in the distribution of his
alms, the prayers which the poor put up
for him will make him blush for his ne∣glect
of God. Conscience will supply the
place of the hand coming forth to write
over against him on the wall, <HI>Thou art
weighed in the balance, and art found want∣ing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. v. 27.</NOTE>. Whereas he who <HI>holds faith and a good conscience together,</HI> who attends equal∣ly
to the discharge of his duty towards
God and towards man, enjoys, as far as
human imperfection allows, the sense of
fairness and consistency in conduct, of in∣tegrity
and soundness of heart.</P>
<P>The man of mere morality is a stranger
to all the delicate and refined pleasures of
devotion. In works of beneficence and
mercy, he may enjoy satisfaction. But his
satisfaction is destitute of that glow of af∣fection
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
which enlivens the feelings of one
who lifts his heart at the same time to
the Father of the universe, and considers
himself as imitating God. The man a∣gain
who rests solely on devotion, if that
devotion open not his heart to humanity,
not only remains a stranger to the plea∣sures
of beneficence, but must often un∣dergo
the pain arising from bad passions.
But unite together beneficence and devo∣tion,
and you pour upon the man in
whom they are united, the full pleasures
of a good and pure heart. His alms con∣nect
him with men; his prayers with
God. He looks without dismay on both
worlds. All nature has to him a benign
aspect. If engaged in active life, he is the
friend of men; and he is happy in the
exertions of that friendship. If left in
retirement, he walks among the works of
nature, as with God. Every object is en∣livened
to him by the sense of the divine
presence. Every where he traces the be∣neficent
hand of the Author of nature;
and every where, with glowing heart,
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
he hears and answers his secret voice.
When he looks up to heaven, he rejoices
in the thought that there dwells that God
whom he serves and honours; that Sa∣viour
in whom he trusts; that Spirit of
grace from whose inspiration his piety and
his charity flow. When he looks around
him on the world, he is soothed with the
pleasing remembrance of the good offices
which he has done, or at least has studied
to do, to many who dwell there. How
comfortable the reflection, that him no
poor man can upbraid for having with∣held
his due; him no unfortunate man
can reproach for having seen and despised
his sorrows; but that on his head are de∣scending
the prayers of the needy and the
aged; and that the hands of those whom
his protection has supported, or his boun∣ty
has fed, are lifted up in secret to bless
him!</P>
<P>Life passed under the influence of such
dispositions, naturally leads to a happy
end. It is not enough to say, that faith
and piety, joined with active virtue, con∣stitute
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
the requisite preparation for hea∣ven.
They in truth begin the enjoyment
of heaven. In every state of our existence
they form the chief ingredients of felicity.
Hence they arc the great marks of Chri∣stian
regeneration. They are the signa∣ture
of that Holy Spirit, by which good
men are said to be <HI>sealed unto the day of
redemption.</HI>—Of the estimation in which
they are held by God, the text affords a
striking proof. Amidst that infinite va∣riety
of human events which pass under
his eye, the prayers and the alms of Cor∣nelius
attracted his particular notice. He
remarked the amiable dispositions which
rose in the heart of this good man. But
he saw that they were yet imperfect,
while he remained unenlightened by the
principles of the Christian religion. To
remove this obstruction to his rising
graces, and to bring him to the full
knowledge of that God whom he sought
to honour, he was favoured with a super∣natural
message from heaven. While the
princes of the earth were left to act by
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
the counsels of their own wisdom; while,
without interposition. from, above, Ge∣nerals
conquered or fell, according to the
vicissitude of human things; to this good
centurion an angel was commissioned
from the throne of God.</P>
<P>What then can I say more or higher in
praise of this blessed character, than that
it is what God delights to honour? Men
single out as the objects of distinction, the
great, the brave, or the renowned. But he
<HI>who seeth not as man seeth,</HI> passing by those
qualities which often shine with false
splendor to human observation, looks to
the inward principles of action; to those
principles which form the essence of a
worthy character; and which, if called
forth, would give birth to whatever is
laudable or excellent in conduct.—Is there
one, though in humble station or obscure
life, who <HI>feareth God and worketh righ∣teousness;</HI>
whose prayers and alms, pro∣ceeding
in regular unaffected tenour, be∣speak
the upright, the tender, the devout
heart?—Those alms and prayers come
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
up in memorial before that God who is
<HI>no respecter of persons.</HI> Him the Almighty
beholds from, his throne with compla∣cency.
Divine illumination is ready to
instruct him. Angels minister to him.
They now mark him out on earth as their
future associate; and for hull they make
ready in paradise the <HI>white robes, the
palms,</HI> and <HI>the sceptres</HI> of the just.</P>
<P>To this honour, to this blessedness, let
our hearts continually aspire; and through∣out
the whole of life, let those solemn and
and sacred words, with which I conclude,
sound in our ears, and be the great direc∣tory
of our conduct:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Micab vi. 8.</NOTE> <HI>He hath shewed
thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord thy God require of thee, but—to do
justly, and love mercy—and to walk humbly

<P>THE life of man has always been a
very mixed state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II</NOTE> full of uncertainty
and vicissitude, of anxieties and fears. In
every religious audience, there are many
who fall under the denomination of the
unfortunate; and the rest are ignorant
how soon they may be called to join them.
For the proserity of no man on earth is
stable and assured. Dark clouds may soon
gather over the heads of those whose sky
is now most bright. In the midst of the
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
deceitful calm which they enjoy, the storm
that is to overwhelm them has perhaps
already begun to ferment. <HI>If a man live
many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let

<P>Hence, to a thoughtful mind, no study
can appear more important, than how to
be suitably prepared for the misfortunes
of life; so as to contemplate them in pro∣spect
without dismay, and, if they must
befal, to bear them with the least dejection.
Throughout every age, the wisdom of the
wise, the treasures of the rich, and the
power of the mighty, have been employed
either in guarding their state against the
approach of distress, or in rendering them∣selves
less vulnerable by its attacks. Power
has endeavoured to remove adversity to a
distance: Philosophy has studied, when it
drew nigh, to conquer it by patience; and
Wealth has sought out every pleasure that
can compensate or alleviate pain.</P>
<P>While the wisdom of the world is thus
occupied, religion has been no less atten∣tive
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
to the same important object. It in∣forms
us in the text, of <HI>a pavilion</HI> which
God erects to shelter his servants <HI>in the
time of trouble,</HI> of a <HI>secret place in his taber∣nacle</HI>
into which he brings them, of a
<HI>rock on which he sets them up;</HI> and else∣where
it tells us of a <HI>shield and a buckler</HI>
which he spreads before them, to <HI>cover
them from the terror by night, and the ar∣row
that flieth by day.</HI> Now, of what na∣ture
are those instruments of defence
which God is represented as providing
with such solicitous care for those who
fear him? Has he reared up any bul∣warks,
impregnable by misfortune, in
order to separate the pious and virtuous
from the rest of mankind, and to screen
them from the common disasters of life?
No: To those disasters we behold them
liable no less than others. The defence
which religion provides, is altogether of
an internal kind. It is the heart, not the
outward state, which it professes to guard.
When the <HI>time of trouble</HI> comes, as come
it must to all, it places good men under
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
<HI>the pavilion</HI> of the Almighty, by afford∣ing
them that security and peace which
arise from the belief of divine protection.
It brings them into the secret of his taber∣nacle,
by opening to them sources of con∣solation
which are hidden from others. By
that strength of mind with which it en∣dows
them, it <HI>sets them up upon a rock,</HI> a∣gainst
which the tempest may violently
beat, but which it cannot shake.</P>
<P>How far the comforts proceeding from
religion merit those high titles under
which they are here figuratively describ∣ed,
I shall in this discourse endeavour to
show. I shall for this end compare to∣gether
the situation of bad men and that
of the good, when both are suffering the
misfortunes of life; and then make such
improvement as the subject will naturally
suggest.</P>
<P>1. RELIGION prepares the mind for en∣countering
with fortitude, the most severe
shocks of adversity; whereas vice, by its
natural influence on the temper, tends to
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
produce dejection under the sightest trials.
While worldly men enlarge their posses∣sions,
and extend their connections, they
imagine that they are strengthening them∣selves
against all the possible vicissitudes of
life. They say in their hearts, <HI>My moun∣tain
stands strong, and I shall never be mov∣ed.</HI>
But so fatal is their delusion, that in∣stead
of strengthening, they are weaken∣ing
that which only can support them
when those vicissitudes come. It is their
mind which must then support them; and
their mind, by their sensual attachments,
they corrupt and weaken. Addicted with
intemperate fondness to the pleasures of
the world, they incur two great and cer∣tain
evils; they both exclude themselves
from every resource except the world,
and they increase their sensibility to every
blow which comes upon them, from that
quarter.</P>
<P>They have neither principles nor temper
which can stand the assault of trouble.
They have no principles which lead them
to look beyond the ordinary rotation of
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
events; and therefore, when misfortunes
involve them, the prospect must be com∣fortless
on every side. Their crimes have
disqualified them for looking up to the
assistance of any higher power than their
own ability, or for relying on any better
guide than their own wisdom. And as
from principle they can derive no sup∣port,
so in a temper corrupted by pros∣perity
they find no relief. They have
lost that moderation of mind which en∣ables
a wise man to accommodate himself
to his situation. Long fed with false hopes,
they are exasperated and stung by every
disappointment. Luxurious and effemi∣nate,
they can bear no uneasinesfs: Proud
and presumptuous, they can brook no
opposition. By nourishing dispositions
which so little suit this uncertain state,
they have infused a double portion of bit∣terness
into the cup of woe; they have
sharpened the edge of that sword which
is lifted up to smite them. Strangers to all
the temperate satisfactions of a good and
a pure mind; strangers to every pleasure
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
except what was seasoned by vice or va∣nity,
their adversity is to the last degree
disconsolate. Flourishing health, and fa∣vourable
fortune, were the two pillars on
which they rested. Shake either of them;
and down falls their whole edifice of hope
and comfort. Prostrate and forlorn, they
are left on the ground; obliged to join
with the man of Ephraim in his abject
lamentation, <HI>They have taken away my gods
which I had made, and what have I more</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges xviii. 24.</NOTE>?—Such are the causes to which we must
ascribe the broken spirits, the peevish tem∣per,
and impatient passions, that so often
attend the declining age, or falling for∣tunes
of vicious men.</P>
<P>But how different is the condition of a
truly good man in those trying situations
of life! Religion had gradually prepared
his mind for all the events of this incon∣stant
state. It had instructed him in the
nature of true happiness. It had early
weaned him from the undue love of the
world, by discovering to him its vanity,
and by setting higher prospects in his
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
view. Afflictions do not attack hint by
surprise, and therefore do not overwhelm
him. He was equipped for the storm, as
well as the calm, in this dubious naviga∣tion
of life. Under those conditions he
knew himself to be brought hither, that
he was not to retain always the enjoyment
of what he loved: And therefore he is not
overcome by disappointment, when that
which is mortal, dies; when that which
it mutable, begins to change; and that
which he knew to be transient, passes
away.</P>
<P>All the principles which religion teaches,
and all the habits which it forms, are fa∣vourable
to strength of mind. It will be
sound, that whatever purifies, fortifies al∣so
the heart. In the course of living <HI>righ∣teously
soberly and godly,</HI> a good man ac∣quires
a steady and well-governed spirit.
Trained, by God's grace, to enjoy with
moderation the advantages of the world,
neither lifted up by success, nor enervated
with sensuality, he meets the changes in
his lot without unmanly dejection: He is
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
inured to temperance and restraint. He has
learned firmness and self-command. He
is accustomed to look up to that Supreme
Providence which disposes of human af∣fairs,
not with reverence only, but with
trust and hope.</P>
<P>The time of prosperity was to him not
merely a season of barren joy, but pro∣ductive
of much useful improvement.
He had properly cultivated his mind: He
had stored it with useful knowledge, with
good principles, and virtuous dispositions.
These resources remain entire, when the
days of trouble come. They remain with
him in sickness, as in health; in poverty,
as in the midst of riches; in his dark and
solitary hours, no less than when sur∣rounded
with friends and gay society.
From the glare of prosperity, he can,
without dejection, withdraw into the
shade. Excluded from several advantages
of the world, he may be obliged to retreat
into a narrower circle; but within that
circle he will find many comforts left.
His chief pleasures were always of the
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
calm, innocent, and temperate kind; and
over these, the changes of the world have
the least power. His mind is a kingdom
to him; and he can still enjoy it. The
world did not bestow upon him all his
enjoyments; and therefore it is not in the
power of the world, by its most cruel at∣tacks,
to carry them all away.</P>
<P>II. THE distresses of life are alleviated to
Good men by reflections on their past con∣duct
while, by such reflections, they are
highly aggravated to the bad. During
the gay and active periods of life, sinners
elude, in some measure, the force of con∣science.
Carried round in the whirl of af∣fairs
and pleasures; intent on contrivance,
or eager in pursuit; amused by hope, or
elated by enjoyment, they are sheltered
bv that croud of trifles which surrounds
them, from, serious thought. But con∣science
is too great a power to remain al∣ways
suppressed. There is in every man's
life, a period when he shall be made to
stand forth as a real object to his own
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
view: And when that period comes, Wo
to him who is galled by the sight! In the
dark and solitary hour of distress, with a
mind hurt and sore from some recent
wound of fortune, how shall he bear to
have his character for the firt time dis∣closed
to him, in that humiliating; light
under which guilt will necessarily present
it? Then, the recollection of the past be∣comes
dreadful. It exhibits to him a life
thrown away on vanities and follies, or
consumed in flagitiousness and sin; no
station properly supported; no material
duties fulfilled. Crimes which once had
been easily palliated, rise before him in
their native deformity. The sense of guilt
mixes itself with all that has befallen him.
He beholds, or thinks that he beholds,
the hand of the God whom he hath of∣fended,
openly stretched out against him.
—At a season when a man stands most in
need of support, how intolerable is the
weight of this additional load, aggravat∣ing
the depression of disease, disappoint∣ment,
or old age! How miserable his
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
state, who is condemned to endure at once
the pangs of guilt, and the vexations of
calamity! <HI>The spirit of a man may sustain
his infirmities; but a wounded spirit, who
can bear?</HI></P>
<P>Whereas, he who is blessed with a clear
conscience, enjoys, in the worst conjunc∣tures
of human life, a peace, a dignity, an
elevation of mind peculiar to virtue. The
testimony of a good conscience is indeed
to be always distinguished from that
presumptuous boast of innocence, which
every good Christian totally disclaims.
The better he is, he will be the more
humble, and sensible of his failings. But
though he acknowledge that he can claim
nothing from God, upon the footing of
desert, yet he can trust in his merciful
acceptance through Jesus Christ, accord∣ing
to the terms of the gospel. He can
hope that his <HI>prayers and his alms have
come tip in memorial before God.</HI> The piety
and virtue of his former life were as seeds
sown in his prosperous state, of which he
reaps the fruits in the season of adversity.
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
The riches, the pleasures, and the friends
of the world, may have made <HI>wings to
themselves, and flown away.</HI> But the im∣provement
which he made of those advan∣tages
while they lasted, the temperate
spirit with which he enjoyed them, the
beneficent actions which he performed,
and the good example which he set to
others, remain behind. By the memory
of these, he enjoys his prosperity a se∣cond
time in reflection; and perhaps this
second and reflected enjoyment is not in∣ferior
to the first. It arrives at a more
critical and needful time. It affords him
the high satisfaction of having extracted
lasting pleasure from that which is short;
and of having fixed that which by its na∣ture
was changing.—“If my race be
now about to end, I have this comfort,
that it has not been run in vain. <HI>I have
fought the good fight; I have kept the
faith. My mind has no load. Futurity
has no terrors. I have endeavoured to
do my duty, and to make my peace
with God. I leave the rest to Heaven.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
These are the reflections which <HI>to the up∣right
make light arise in darkness;</HI> reflec∣tions,
which clear the lonely house of vir∣tuous
poverty, and attend the conscien∣tious
sufferer into prison or exile; which
sooth the complaints of grief, lighten the
pressure of old age, and furnish to the
bed of sickness a cordial of more grateful
relish, and more sovereign virtue, than
any which the world can afford.</P>
<P>Look abroad into life, and you will
find the general sense of mankind bearing
witness to this important truth, that mind
is superior to fortune; that what one feels
within, is of much greater importance
than all that befals him without. Let a
man be brought into some such severe and
trying situation, as fixes the attention of
the public on his behaviour. The first
question which we put concerning him, is
not, What does he suffer? but, How does
he bear it? Has he a quiet mind? or, Does
he appear to be unhappy within? If we
judge him to be composed and firm, re∣signed
to Providence, and supported by
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
conscious integrity, his character rises,
and his misery lessens in our view. We
esteem and admire, rather than pity him.
Recollect what holy men have endured
for the sake of conscience, and with what
chearfulness they have suffered. On the
other hand, when conscience has concur∣red
with outward misfortunes in distres∣sing
the guilty, think of the dreadful
consequences which have ensued. How
often, upon, a reverse of fortune, after ab∣used
prosperity, have they madly hurried
themselves over that precipice from which
there is no return; and, in what nature
most abhors, the voluntary extinction of
life, have sought relief from that torment
of reflection, which was become too great
for them to bear?</P>
<P>Never then allow yourselves to imagine
that misfortunes alone form the chief mi∣sery
of man. None but the guilty are
completely miserable. The misgiving and
distrust, the accusations and reproaches of
their minds, the sense of having drawn
down upon their heads the evils which
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
they suffer and the terrifying expecta∣tion
of more and worse evils to come;
these are the essential ingredients of hu∣man
misery. They not only whet the
edge, but they envenom the darts of af∣fliction,
and add poison to the wound.
Whereas, when misfortunes assail a. good
man, they carry no such fatal auxiliaries
in their train. They may tear the surface
of his soul; but there is a strength with∣in,
which resists their farther impression.
The constitution. of his mind is found.
The world can inflict upon it no wounds,
but what admit of cure.</P>
<P>III. ILL men in the time of trouble can
look up to no Protector, while good men
commit themselves, with trust and hope,
to the care of Heaven. The human mind,
naturally feeble, is made to feel all its
weakness by the pressure of adversity.
Dejected with evils which overpower its
strength, it relies no longer on itself. It
casts every where around a wishing ex∣ploring
eye, for some shelter to screen,
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
some power to uphold it; and if, when
abandoned by the world, it can find no∣thing
to which it may fly in the room of
the world, its state is truly forlorn. Now,
whither should the ungodly, in this situa∣tion,
turn for aid? After having contend∣ed
with the storms of adverse fortune till
their spirits are exhausted, gladly would
they retreat at last to the sanctuary of re∣ligion.
But that sanctuary is shut against
them; nay, it is environed with terrors.
They behold there, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Protector to
whom they can fly, but a Judge whom
they dread; and in those moments when
they need his friendship the most, they
are reduced to deprecate his wrath. If he
once <HI>called when they refusedy and stretch∣ed
out his hands when they would not re∣gard,</HI>
how much reason have they to fear,
that he will leave them now to <HI>eat the
fruit of their own ways, and to be filled with
their own devices;</HI> that he will <HI>laugh at
their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51"/>
But of all the thoughts which can enter
into the mind, in the season of distress,
the belief of an interest in his favour
who rules the world is the most soothing.
Every form of religion has afforded to
virtuous men some degree of this conso∣lation.
But it was reserved for the Chri∣stian
revelation to carry it to its highest
point. For it is the direct scope of that
revelation, to accommodate itself to the
circumstances of man, under two main
views; as guilty in the sight of God, and
as struggling with the evils of the world.
Under the former, it discovers to him a
Mediator and an atonement; under the
latter, it promises him the Spirit of grace
and consolation. It is a system of com∣plete
relief, extending from our spiritual
to our temporal distresses. The same hand
which holds out forgiveness to the peni∣tent,
and assistance to the frail, dispenses
comfort and hope to the afflicted.</P>
<P>It deservcs your particular notice, in
this view, that there is no character which
God more frequently assumes to himself
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
in the sacred writings, than that of the pa∣tron
of the distressed. Compassion is that
attribute of his nature which he has cho∣sen
to place in the greatest variety of
lights, on purpose that he might accom∣modate
his majesty to our weakness, and
provide a cordial for human griefs. He
is the hearer of all prayers; but with par∣ticular
attention he is represented as list∣ening
to the <HI>cry of the poor,</HI> and <HI>regard∣ing
the prayer of the destitute.</HI> All his crea∣tures
he governs with justice and wisdom;
but he takes to himself, in a special man∣ner,
the charge of <HI>executing judgment for
the oppressed,</HI> of <HI>protecting the stranger,</HI> of
<HI>delivering him who hath no helper from the hand of the
spoiler. For the oppression of the
poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I
arise, saith the Lord, to set him in sasety from
him that puffeth at him. He is the Father
of the fatherless, and the Judge of the wi∣dow
in his holy habitation. He raiseth up
them that are bowed down. He dwelleth
with the contrite. He healeth the broken in
heart. For he knoweth our frame; he re∣membereth
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
that we are duft</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. ix. 8.—cii. 17.—cxlvi. 7.—lxviii. 5.—cxlvii. 3. ciii. 14.—&amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c.</NOTE>.—If the
wisdom of his providence saw it necessary
to place so many of his creatures in an
afflicted state, that state, however, he com∣miserates.
He disdains not to point out
himself as the refuge of the virtuous and
pious; and to invite them, amidst all their
troubles, to pour out their hearts before
him. Those circumstances which estrange
others from them, interest him the more
in their situation. The neglect or scorn
of the world expose them not to any con∣tempt
in his sight. No obscurity conceals
them from his notice; and though they
should be forgotten by every friend on
earth, they are remembered by the God
of heaven. That sigh, heaved from the
afflicted bosom, which is heard by no hu∣man
ear, is listened to by him; and that
tear is remarked, which falls unnoticed
or despised by the world.</P>
<P>Such views of the Supreme Being im∣part
the most sensible consolation to every
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
pious heart. They present his administra∣tion
under an aspect so mild and benign,
as in a great measure to disperse the gloom
which hangs over human life. A good
man acts with a vigour, and suffers with
a patience more than human, when he
believes himself countenanced by the
Almighty. Injured or oppressed by the
world, he looks up to a Judge who
will vindicate his cause; he appeals to a
Witness who knows his integrity; he
commits himself to a Friend who will never
forsake him. When tired with the vexa∣tions
of life, devotion opens to him its
quiet retreat, where the tumults of the
world are hushed, and its cares are lost in
happy oblivion; where <HI>the wicked cease
from troubling, and the weary are at rest.</HI>
There his mind regains its serenity; the
agitation of passion is calmed; and a soft∣ening
balm is infused into the wounds of
the spirit. Disclosing to an invisible Friend
those secret griefs which he has no encou∣ragement
to make known to the world, his
heart is lightened. He docs not feel him∣self
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
self solitary or forsaken. He believes God
to be present with him, and the Holy
Ghost to be the inspirer of his consolati∣ons.
From that <HI>secret place of the divine
tabernacle,</HI> into which the Text represents
him as admitted, he hears this voice issue,
<HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will
answer thee. Fear not; for I am with thee.
Be not dismayed; for I am thy God.</HI>
And as He hears a voice which speaks to none but
the pure in heart, so he beholds a hand
which sinners cannot see. He beholds the
hand of Providence conducting all the
hidden springs and movements of the uni∣verse;
and with a secret, but unerring ope∣ration,
directing every event towards the
happiness of the righteous. Those afflicti∣ons
which appear to others the messengers
of the wrath of Heaven, appear to him the
ministers of sanctification and wisdom.
Where they discern nothing but the hor∣rors
of the tempest which surrounds them,
his more enlightened eye beholds the an∣gel
who rides in the whirlwind, and di∣rects
the storm. Hence a <HI>peace keeping the
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
mind and heart,</HI> which is no where to be
found but under <HI>the pavilion of the Al∣mighty.</HI></P>
<P>IV. God men are comforted under
their troubles by the hope of heaven; while
bad men are not only deprived of this hope,
but distressed with fears arising from a fu∣ture
state. The soul of man can never di∣vest
itself wholly of anxiety about its fate
hereafter. There are hours when even to
the prosperous, in the midst of their plea∣sures,
eternity is an awful thought. But
much more when those pleasures, one after
another, begin to withdraw; when life al∣ters
its form, and becomes dark and chear∣less;
when its changes warn the most in∣considerate,
that what is so mutable will
soon pass entirely away; then, with pun∣gent
earnestness comes home that question
to the heart, Into what world are we next
to go?—How miserable the man, who, un∣der
the distractions of calamity, hangs
doubtful about an event which so nearly
concerns him; who, in the midst of doubts
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
and anxieties, approaching to that awful
boundary which separates this world from
the next, shudders at the dark prospect
before him; wishing to exist after death,
and yet afraid of that existence; catching
at every feeble hope which superstition can
afford him, and trembling, in the same
moment, from reflection upon his crimes!</P>
<P>But blessed be God who hath <HI>brought
life and immortality to light;</HI> who hath not
only brought them to light, but secured
them to good men; and by the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ, hath <HI>begot∣ten
them into the lively hope of an inheri∣tance
incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth
not away.</HI> Justly is this hope stiled in
scripture the <HI>anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast.</HI> For what an anchor is to a ship
in a dark night, on an unknown coast, and
amidst a boisterous ocean, that is this hope
to the soul when distracted by the confu∣sions
of the world. In the midst of dan∣ger,
it gives security; in the midst of gene∣ral
fluctuation, it affords one fixed point
of rest. It is indeed the most eminent of
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
all the advantages which religion now
confers. For, consider the mighty power of
hope over the human mind. It is the uni∣versal
comforter. It is the spring of all hu∣man
activity. Upon futurity, men are con∣stantly
fuspended. From the prospect of
some future good, they toil and suffer
through the whole course of life; and it
is not so much what they are at present,
as what they hope to be in some after
time, that enlivens their motions; fixes
attention, and stimulates industry. Now,
if in the common affairs of life such is the
energy of hope, even when its object is
neither very considerable, nor very cer∣tain;
what effects may it not be expected
to produce, when it rests upon an object
so splendid, as a life of immortal felicity?
Were this hope entertained -with that full
persuasion which Christian faith demands,
it would, in truth, not merely alleviate,
but totally annihilate, all human miseries.
It would banish discontent, extinguish
grief, and suspend the very feeling of pain.</P>
<P>But allowing for the mixture of human
frailty; admitting those abatements which
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
our imperfection makes upon the effect of
every religious principle, still you will find,
that In proportion to the degree in which
the hope of Heaven operates upon good
men, they will be tranquil under suffer∣ings;
nay, they will be happy, in com∣parison
of those who enjoy no such relief.
What indeed, in the course of human af∣fairs,
is sufficient to distress, far less to over∣whelm
the mind of that man, who can look
down on all human things from an eleva∣tion
so much above them? He is only a
passenger through this world. He is travel∣ling
to a happier country. How disagree∣able
soever the occurrences of his journey
may be, yet, at every stage of that jour∣ney,
he receives the assurance that he is
drawing nearer and nearer to the period of
rest and felicity.—Endure, and thou shalt
overcome. Persevere, and thou shalt be
successful. The time of trial hastens to a
close. Thy mansion is prepared above;
thy rest remaineth among the people of
God. The disorders which vice has intro∣duced
into the works of God, are about to
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
terminate; and all tears are soon to be
wiped away from the eyes of the just.—
The firm assurance of this happy conclu∣sion
to the vexations and the vanities of
life, works a greater effect on the sincere
illiterate Christian, than all the refinements
of philosophy can work on the most learned
infidel. These may gratify the mind that
is at ease; may sooth the heart when only
discomposed in a slight degree; but when
it is sore and deeply torn, when bereaved
of its best and most beloved comforts, the
only consolations that can then find access,
arise from the hope of a better world; where
those comforts shall be again restored; and
all the virtuous shall be assembled, in the
presence of him who made them. Such
hopes banish that black melancholy which
overwhelms, and leave only that tender
melancholy which softens the heart, and
often renders the whole character more
gentle and amiable.</P>
<P>Of this nature are the resources which
religion provides for good men. By its
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
previous discipline, it trains them to forti∣trude;
by the reflections of a good consci∣ence
it sooths, by the sense of divine fa∣vour
it supports them; and when every
comfort fails them on earth, it chears them
with the hope of heaven. Distinguishing
his servants with such advantages, God is
justly said to erect <HI>his pavilion</HI> over them
in the evil time. He not only <HI>spreads a tent
for them in the wilderness,</HI> but he trans\forms
in some measure the state of nature
around them. To use the beautiful lan∣guage
of antient prophecy; <HI>In the desart,
the thirsty land, where no water is, he opens
springs. Instead of the thorn he makes the
fir-tree to come up; instead of the briar, the
myrtle to spring. In midst of the habitas∣tion
of dragons, he makes green pastures rise,
and still waters flow around his people.</HI></P>
<P>THE improvement to be made of these
truths is as obvious, as it is important.
Let us study so to conduct our lives, that
we may be qualified for deriving such
consolations from religion. To their rea∣lity,
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
and their importance, all mankind
bear witness. For no sooner are they
overtaken by distress, than to religion
they all fly. This, throughout every age,
has been the universal shelter which the
young and the old, the high and the low,
the giddy and the serious, have sought to
gain, as soon as they found that rest could
be no where else procured for the weary
head, or the aching heart. But amidst
those multitudes that croud to religion for
relief, how few are entitled to approach
that sacred source of comfort? On what
feeble props do their hopes and pretensions
rest? How much superstition mingles
with that religion to which men are driven
by distress and fear?—You must first ap∣ply
to it as the guide of life, before you
can have recourse to it as the refuge of
sorrow. You must submit to its legislative
authority, and experience its renewing
influence, before you can look for its con∣solatory
effect. You must secure the te∣stimony
of a good conscience, and peace
with God through Jesus Christ; otherwise,
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
<HI>when the floods shall come, and the rains de∣scend,
and the winds blow,</HI> the house which
you had proposed for your retreat, shall
prove the <HI>bouse sounded on the sand, not on
the rock.</HI></P>
<P>There are two plans, and there are but
two, on which any man can propose to
conduct himself through the dangers and
distresses of human life. The one is the plan
of worldly wisdom; the other, that of de∣termined
adherence to conscience. He who
acts upon the former, lays principle aside,
and trusts his defence to his art and abi∣lity.
Me avails himself of every advantage
which his knowledge of the world sug∣gests.
He attends to nothing but what he
considers as his interest, and, unconfined
by conscience, pursues it by every course
which promises him success. This plan,
though too often adopted, will be found, on
trial, ineffectual and deceitful. For human
ability is an unequal match for the violent
and unforeseen vicissitudes of the world.
When these torrents rise in their might,
they sweep away in a moment the banks
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
which worldly wisdom had reared for de∣fence,
and overwhelm alike the crafty and
the artless. In the mean time, persons of
this character condemn themselves to live
a most unquiet life. They pass their days
in perpetual anxiety, listening to every
motion; startled by every alarm; chan∣ging
their measures on every new occur∣rence;
and when, distress breaks in over
all their defences, they arc left under it,
hopeless and disconsolate.</P>
<P>The plan which, in opposition to this,
religion recommends, as both more ho∣nourable
in itself, and more effectual for
security, is, at all hazards, to do your
duty, and to leave the consequcnces to
God. Let him. who would act upon this
plan, adopt for the rule of his conduct,
that maxim of the Psalmist's, <HI>Trust in the
Lord, and do good</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxvii. 3.</NOTE>. To firm integrity, let
him join a humble reliance on God. Let
his adherence to duty, encourage his reli∣gious
trust. Let his religious trust, inspire
him with fortitude in the performance of
his duty. Let him know no path but the
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
straight and direct one. In the most cri∣tical
moments of action, let him ask no
further questions, than, What is the right,
the fit, the worthy part? How as a man,
and as a Christian, it becomes him to act?
Having received the decision of conscience,
let him <HI>commit his way unto the Lord.</HI> Let
him, without trepidation or wavering,
proceed in discharging his duty; resolved,
that though the world may make him
unfortunate, it shall never make him
base; and confiding, that in what God
and his conscience require him to act or
suffer, God and a good conscience will sup∣port
him.—Such principles as these, are
the best preparation for the vicissitudes of
the human lot. They are the shield of
inward peace. He who thinks and acts
thus, shall be exposed to no wounds but
what religion can cure. He may feel the
blows of adversity; but shall not know
the wounds of the heart.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Influence of Religion upon Prosperity</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM i. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers
of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in
his season; his leaf also shall not wither,
and whatsoever he doth shall prosper.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE happy influence of religion
upon human life, in the time of ad∣versity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE>
has been considered, in the pre∣ceding
discourse. Concerning this the
sentiments of men are more generally
agreed, than with respect to some other
prerogatives which religion claims. They
very readily assign to it the office of a
Comforter. But as long as their state is
prosperous, they are apt to account it an
unnecessary guest, perhaps an unwelcome
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
intruder. Let us not be thus unjust to
religion, nor confine its importance to
one period only in the life of man. It
was never intended to be merely the nurse
of sickness, and the staff of old age. I
purpose now to show you, That it is no
less essential to the enjoyment of prospe∣rity,
than to the comfort of adversity:
That prosperity is prosperous, if we may
be allowed the expression, to a good man
only; and that to every other person, it
will prove, notwithstanding its fair ap∣pearance,
a barren and joyless state.
The Psalmist, in the Text, by an image
taken from one of the most beautiful ob∣jects
in nature, describes a man who
flourishes in full prosperity. But to whom
is the description limited? To him, as the
preceding verses inform us, <HI>that walketh
not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat
of the scornful but hath his delight in the
law of God,</HI> He only is <HI>like the tree plant∣ed
by the rivers of water;</HI> whilst <HI>the un∣godly</HI>
as he adds, <HI>are not so;</HI> but how
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
prosperous soever they may appear to the
world, are in truth but like <HI>the chaff which
the wind driveth away.</HI> In confirmation
of this doctrine, I shall lay before you,
some of those circumstances which distin∣guish
the prosperity of the good man be∣yond
that of the sinner; and shall con∣clude,
with pointing out the dangers and
miseries, into which the latter is apt to be
betrayed, by his favourable situation in
the world.
I. PIETY, and gratitude to God, con∣tribute
in a high degree to enliven pros∣perity.
Gratitude is a pleasing emotion.
The sense of being distinguished by the
kindness of another, gladdens the heart,
warms it with reciprocal affection, and
gives to any posession which is agreeable
in itself, a double relish, from its being
the gift of a friend. Favours conferred
by men, I acknowledge, may prove bur∣densome.
For human virtue is never per∣fect;
and sometimes unreasonable expec∣tations
on the one side, sometimes a mor∣tifying
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
sense of dependence on the other,
corrode in secret the pleasure of benefits,
and convert the obligations of friendship
into grounds of jealousy. But nothing of
this kind can affect the intercourse of gra∣titude
with Heaven. Its favours are
wholly disinterested; and with a grati∣tude
the most cordial and unsuspicious,
a good man looks up to that Almighty
Benefactor, who aims at no end but the
happiness of those whom he blesses, and
who desires no return from them, but
a devout and thankful heart. While
others can trace their prosperity to no
higher source than a series of worldly
causes, and, often, of mean or trisling in∣cidents,
which occasionally favoured their
designs; with what superior satisfaction
does the servant of God remark the hand
of that gracious Power which hath raised
him up; which hath happily conducted
him through the various steps of life, and
crowned him with the most favourable
distinction beyond his equals?
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
Let us farther consider, that not only
gratitude for the past, but a chearing
sense of God's favour at the present, en∣ters
into the pious emotion. They are
only the virtuous, who in their prosper∣ous
days hear this voice addressed to
them: <HI>Go thy way eat thy bread with joy,
and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for
God now accepteth thy works.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ECCLEF. IX. 7.</NOTE> He who
is the Author of their prosperity, gives
them a title to enjoy, with complacency,
his own gift. While bad men snatch the
plcasures of the world as by stealth, with∣out
countenance from God. the proprietor
of the world, the righteous fit openly
down to the feast of life, under the smile
of approving Heaven. No guilty fears
damp their joys. The blessing of God
rests upon all that they possess; his pro∣tection
surrounds them; and hence, <HI>in the
habitations of the righteous is found the
voice of rejoicing and salvation.</HI> A lustre
unknown to others, invests, in their sight,
the whole face of nature. Their piety re∣flect
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
a sun-shine from heaven upon the
prosperity of the world; unites in one
point of view, the smiling aspect both of
the powers above, and of the objects be∣low.
Not only have they as full a relish
as others, of the innocent pleasures of
life, but, moreover, in these they hold
communion with God. In all that is
good or fair, they trace his hand. From
the beauties of nature, from the improve∣ments
of art, from the enjoyments of so∣cial
life, they raise their affection to the
source of all the happiness which sur∣rounds
them; and thus widen the sphere
of their pleasures, by adding intellectual,
and spiritual, to earthly joys.</P>
<P>For illustration of what I have said on
this head, remark that chearful enjoy∣ment
of a prosperous state which King
David had, when he wrote the twenty-third
Psalm; and venture, if you can, to
compare the highest pleasures of the
riotous sinner, with the happy and satis∣fied
spirit which breathes throughout that
Psalm.—In the midst of the splendour of
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
royalty, with what amiable simplicity of
gratitude does he look up to the Lord
as <HI>his Shepherd;</HI> happier in ascribing all
his success to divine favour, than to the
policy of his counsels, or to the force of
his arms! How many instances of divine
goodness arose before him, in pleasing re∣membrance,
when with such relish he
speaks of the <HI>green pastures and still waters
beside which God had led him, of his cup
which he had made to overflow,</HI> and of <HI>the
table which he had prepared for him in
presence of his enemies!</HI> With what perfect
tranquillity does he look forward to the
time of his passing through <HI>the valley of
the shadow of death;</HI> unappalled by that
Spectre, whose most distant appearance
blasts the prosperity of sinners! He fears
no evil, as long as <HI>the rod and the staff</HI> of
his Divine Shepherd are with him; and
through all the unknown periods of this,
and of a future existence, commits him∣self
to his guidance with secure and tri∣umphant
hope. <HI>Surely goodnese and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life; and
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever</HI>—What a purified, sentimental en∣joyment
of prosperity, is here exhibited!.
How different from that gross relish of
worldly pleasures, which belongs to those
who behold only the terrestrial side of
things; whose views rise no higher than
the succession of human contingencies,
and the weak efforts of human ability;
who have no protector or patron in the
heavens, to enliven their prosperity, or
to warm their hearts with gratitude and
trust</P>
<P>II. RELIGION affords to good men a
peculiar security in the enjoyment of their
prosperity. One of the first reflections
which must strike every thinking man,
after his situation in the world has become
agreeable, is the instability of that situa∣tion.
From a variety of causes, he lies
open to change. On many sides he sees
that he may be pierced; and the wider
his comforts extend, the broader is the
mark which he spreads to the arrows of
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
misfortune. Hence many a secret alarm
to the reflecting mind; and to those who
reject all such alarms, the real danger in∣creases,
in proportion to their improvi∣dent
security.</P>
<P>By worldly assistance it is vain to think
of providing any effectual defence, seeing
the world's mutability is the very cause
of our terror. It is from a higher prin∣ciple,
from a power superior to the world,
that relief must be sought, amidst such
disquietudes of the heart. He who in
his prosperity can look up to One who is
witness to his moderation, humanity, and
charity he who can appeal to Heaven,
that he has not been elated by pride, nor
overcome by pleasure, but has studied to
employ its gifts to the honour of the giver;
this man, if there be any truth in reli∣gion,
if there be any benignity or good∣ness
in the administration of the universe,
has somewhat to rest upon for security
and hope. Not that an interest in God's
grace will perpetuate to a goood man,
more than to others, a life of unruffled
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
prosperity. Change and alteration form
the very essence of the world. But let the
world change around him at pleasure, he
has ground to hope that it shall not be able
to make him unhappy. Whatever may
change, God's providence is still the same;
and his love to the righteous remains un∣altered.
If it shall be the divine will to
remove one comfort, he trusts that some
other shall be given. Whatever is given,
whatever is taken away, he confides, that
in the last result, all <HI>shall work for his
good.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, he is not difturbed, like bad
men, by the instability of the world. Dan∣gers,
which overcome others, shake not his
more steady mind. He enjoys the pleasures
of life pure and unallayed, because he en∣joys
them, as long as they last, without
anxious terrors. They are not his all, his
only good. He welcomes them, when they
arrive; and when they pass away, he can
eye them, as they depart, without agony
or despair. His prosperity strikes a deep∣er
and firmer root than that of the un∣godly.
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
And for this reason he is com∣pared,
in the Text, to a <HI>tree planted by the
rivers of water;</HI> a tree, whose branches
the tempest may indeed bend, but whose
roots it cannot touch; a tree, which may
occasionally be stripped of its leaves and
blossoms, but which still maintains its
place, and. in due season fiourishes anew.
Whereas the sinner, in his prosperity, ac∣cording
to the allusion in the book of Job,
resembles <HI>the rush that groweth up in the
mire</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job vii. II.</NOTE>; a slender reed, that may flourish
green for a while by the side of the
brook, as long as it is cherished by the
sun, and fanned by the breeze; till the
first bitter blast breaks its seeble stem, roots
it out from its bed, and lays it in the
dust. Lo! such is the prosperity <HI>of them
that forget God; and thus their hope shall
perish.</HI></P>
<P>III. RELIGION forms GOod men to the
most proper temper for the enjoyment of
prosperity. A little reflection may satisfy
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
us, that mere possession, even granting it
to be secure, does not constitute enjoy∣ment.
Give a man all that is in the
power of the world to bestow surround
him with riches; crown him with. ho∣nours;
invest him, if you will, with, ab∣solute
dominion; but leave him at the
same time under some secret oppcession or
heaviness of heart; you bestow indeed the
materials of enjoyment, but you deprive
him of ability to extract it. You set a
feast before him, but he wants the power
of tasting it. Hence prosperity is so often
an equivocal ward, denoting merely af∣fluence
of possession, but unjustly applied
to the miserable possessor.</P>
<P>We all know the effects which any
indisposition of the body, even though
slight, produces on external prosperity.
Visit the gayest and most fortunate man
on earth, only with sleepless nights; dis∣order
any single organ of his senses; cor∣rode
but one of his smallest nerves; and
you shall presently see all his gaiety va∣nish
you shall hear him complain, that
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
he is a miserable creature, and. express his
envy of the peasant and the cottager.—And
can you believe, that a disease in the
soul is less fatal to enjoyment, than a
disease in the animal frame; or that a
sound mind is not as essentiai, as a sound
body to the prosperity of man?—Let us
rate sensnal gratifications as high as we
please, we shall be made to feel that the
seat of enjoyment is in the soul. The cor∣rupted
temper, and the gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty passions of
the bad, frnstrate the effect of every ad∣vantage
which the world confers on them.
The world may call them men of plea∣sure,
but of all others they are the great∣est
foes to pleasure. From tnieir eagerness
to grasp, they strangle and destroy it.
None but the temperate, the regular, and
the virtuous, know how to enjoy prosperi∣ty.
They bring to its comforts the manly
relish of a sound uncorrupted mind. They
stop at the proper point, before enjoy∣ment
degenerates into disgust, and plea∣sure
is converted into pain. They are
strangers to those complaints which flow
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
from spleen, caprice, and all the fantastical
distresses of a vitiated mind. While riot∣ous
indulgence enervates both the body
and the mind, purity and virtue heighten
all the powers of human fruition. Mo∣derate
and simple pleasures. relish high
with the temperate; In the midst of his
studied resimements, the voluptuary lan∣guishes</P>
<P>Wherever guilt mingles with prospe∣rity,
a certain gloom and heaviness enter
along with it. Vitious intrigues never
fail to entangle and embarrass those who
engage in them. But innocence confers
ease and freedom on the mind; leaves it
open to every pleasing sensation; gives a
lightness to the spirits, similar to the na∣tive
gaiety of youth and health; ill imi∣tated,
and ill supplied by that forced le∣vity
of the vitious, which aiises not from
the health, but from the drunkenness of
the mind.</P>
<P>Feeble are all pleasures in. which, the
heart has no part. The selfish gratifica∣tions
of the bad, are both narrow in their
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
circle, and short in their duration. But
prosperity is redoubled, to a good man, by
his generous use of it. It is reflected back
upon him from every one whom he makes
happy. In the intercourse of domestic af∣fection,
in the attachment of friends, the
gratitude of dependents, the esteem and
good will of all who know him, he sees
blessings multiplied round him on every
side. <HI>When, the ear beard me then it blessed
me; and when the eye saw me it gave wit∣ness
to me. Because I delivered the poor that
cried the fatherless and him that had none
to help him. The blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon me, and I caused
the widow's heart to sing for joy. I was
eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame:
I was a father to the poor; and the cause
which I knew not, I searched out</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxix. II,—17.</NOTE>—<HI>Thus,
whilst the righteous fiourisheth like a tree
planted by the rivers of water he bring∣eth
forth also his fruit in his season:</HI> And
that fruit, to pursue the allusion of the
Text, he brings forth not for himself
alone. He flourishes, not like a tree in
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
some solitary desart, which scatters its
blossoms to the wind, and communicates
neither fruit nor shade to any living
thing: But like a tree in the midst of an
inhabited country, which to some affords
friendly shelter, to others, fruit; which
is not only admired by all for its beauty,
but blessed by the traveller for the shade,
and by the hungry for the sustenance it

<P>IV. RELIGION heightens the prosperity
of good men, by the prospect which it af∣fords
them of greater happiness to come
in another world. I showed, in the fore∣going
discourse, the mighty effect of the
hope of heaven, in relieving the mind un∣der
the troubles of life. And sure, if this
hope be able to support the falling, it
cannot but improve the flourishing state
of man; if it can dispel the thickest
gloom of adversity, it must needs enliven
prosperity by the additional lustre which
it throws upon it. What is present, is
never sufficient to give us full satifaction.
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
To the present we must always join some
agreeable anticipations of futurity, in or∣der
to complete our pleasure. What an
accession then must the prosperity of the
righteous man receive, when born with
a smooth and gentle gale along the cur∣rent
of life, and looking round on all the
blessings of his state, he can consider these
as no more than an introduction to higher
scenes which are hereafter to open; he
can view his present life, as only the
porch through which he is to pass into
the palace of bliss; and his present joys,
as but a feeble stream, dispensed for his
occasional refreshment, until he arrive at
that river of life, which flows at God's
right hand?—Such prospects purify the
mind, at the same time that they gladden
it. They prevent a good man from set∣ting
too high a value on his present pos∣sessions;
and thereby assist him in main∣taining,
amidst the temptations of worldly
pleasure, that command of himself which
is so essential to the wise and temperate
enjoyment of prosperity.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="83"/>
It is the fate of all human pleasures,
by continuance, to fade; of most of them,
to cloy. Hence, in the most prosperous
state, there are frequent intervals of lan∣guor,
and even of dejection. There are
vacuities in the happiest life, which it is
not in the power of the world to fill up.
What relief so adapted to those vacant or
dejected periods, as the pleasing hopes
which arise from immortality? How bar∣ren
and imperfect that prosperity, which
can have recourse to no such subsidiary
comfort, in order to animate the stagna∣tion
of vulgar life, and to supply the in∣sufficiency
of worldly pleasures!</P>
<P>Worldly prosperity declines with de∣clining
life. In youth, its relish was
brisk and poignant. It becomes more
sober as life advances; and flattens as life
descends. He who lately overflowed with
gay spirits and high hopes, begins to
look back with heaviness on the days of
former years. He thinks of his old com∣panions
who are gone; and reviews past
scenes more agreeable than any which are
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
likely to return. The activity of pursuit
is weakened. The vivacity of amusement
is spent. The gratifications of sense lan∣guish.
When his accustomed pleasures,
one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another, thus steal treacherously
away, what can he, who is an utter stran∣ger
to religion, and to the hope of Heaven,
substitute in their place?—But even in
in that drooping period, the promises and
hopes of religion support the spirits of a
good man till the latest hour. <HI>His leaf,</HI>
it is said in the Text, <HI>shall not wither.</HI>
It shall not be in the power of time to
blast his prosperity. But old age shall re∣ceive
him into a quiet retreat, where, if
vivid sensations fail, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleasures re∣main
to sooth him. That hope of im∣mortality,
which before improved his other
enjoyments, now in a great measure sup∣plies
their absence. Its importance rises,
in proportion as its object draws near.
He is not forsaken by the world, but re∣tires
from it with dignity; reviewing
with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind the part which he has
acted, and trusting to the promise of God,
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
for an approaching reward. Such pros∣pects
shed a pleasing tranquillity over the
old age of the righteous man. They make
the evening of his days go down uncloud∣ed;
and allow the stream of life, though
waxing low, to run clear to the last drop.</P>
<P>THUS I have shown, I hope, with full
evidence, what material ingredients re∣ligion
and a good conscience are in the
prosperity of life. Separated from them,
prosperity, how fair soever it may show
to the world, is insipid, nay, frequently
noxious to the possessor: United with
them, it rises into a real blessing bestowed
by God upon man. <HI>God giveth to a man
that is good in his sight, wisdom, and know∣ledge,
and joy; but to the sinner he giveth
sore travel, to gather, and to heap up, that
he may give to him that is good before
God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALLOW me now to conclude the sub∣ject,
with representing to the prosperous
men of the world, those crimes and mi∣series
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
into which the abuse of their con∣dition
is likely to betray them, and call∣ing
upon them to beware of the dangers
with which they are threatened.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate for mankind, that those
situations which favour pleasure, are too
generally adverse to virtue. Virtue re∣quires
internal government and disci∣pline;
prosperity relaxes the mind, and
inflames the passions. Virtue is support∣ed
by a regard to what is future; prospe∣rity
attaches us wholly to what is present.
The characteristics of virtue, are modesty
and humility; the most common attend∣ants
of prosperity, are pride and pre∣sumption.
One should think, that pros∣perity
would prove the strongest incite∣ment
to remember and to honour that
God who bestows it. Yet such is the
perversen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of human nature, that it
proves much oftener the motive to im∣piety.
The changes of the world call the
attention of men to an Invisible Power.
But a train of events proceeding accord∣ing
to their wish, leads them to nothing
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
beyond what they see. The Supreme
Giver is concealed from view by his own
gifts. This instance of success they ascribe
to a fortunate concurrence of worldly
causes; that acquisition, to their own
skill and industry; unmindful of him
who, from the beginning, arranged that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eries of causes, and who placed them in
circumstances where their industry could
operate with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccess. From forgetting
God, they too often proceed to despise
him. All that is light or giddy in their
minds, is set in motion by the gale of
prosperity. Arrogance and self-sufficiency
are lifted up; and their state is consider∣ed,
as secured by their own strength.
Hence that <HI>pride of countenance</HI> through
which the wicked in their prosperity, as
David observes, <HI>refuse to seek after God.</HI>
They are described as <HI>speaking lostily, and
setting their mouth against the Heavens.
They take the timbrel and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arp, and rejoice
at the sound of the organ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they say unto
God, Depart from us, for we de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re not the
knowledge of thy ways. What is the Al∣mighty,
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
that we should serve him? Or
what profit should we have, if we pray un∣to
him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They say unto God, Depart from us.—</HI>
What an impious voice! Could we have
believed it possible, that worldly pleasures
should so far intoxicate any human heart?
Wretched and infatuated men! Have you
ever considered on what your confidence
rests?—You have said in your hearts, <HI>You
shall never be moved;</HI> you fancy yourselves
placed on a <HI>mountain which standeth strong.</HI>
Awake from those flattering dreams, and
behold how every thing totters around
you! You stand on the edge of a preci∣pice;
and the ground is sliding away be∣low
your feet. In your health, life, pos∣sessions,
connections, pleasures, the seeds
of change are sown; principles of de∣struction
work. The mine advances in
secret, which saps the foundations, while
you revel on the surface. No mighty ef∣fort,
no long preparation of events, is
needed to overturn your prosperity. By
slow degrees it rose. Long time, much
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
labour, and the concurrence of many as∣sisting
causes, were necessary to rear it up;
but one slight incident can reduce it to
nought. Suspicions are infused into the
patron or the prince on whom you de∣pend;
and your disgrace ensues. Exer∣cise,
or amusement, kindles a fever in
the veins of those whom you loved; and
you are robbed of your comforts and
hopes. A few grains of sand lodge them∣selves
within you; and the rest of your
life is disease and misery. Ten thousand
contingencies ever float on the current of
life, the smallest of which, if it meet
your frail bark in the passing, is sufficient
to dash it in pieces.—Is this a place, is
this a time, to swell with fancied security,
to riot in unlawful pleasure, and, by
your disregard of moral and religious du∣ties,
to brave the government of the Al∣mighty?
He hath stamped every posses∣sion
of man with this inscription, <HI>Rejoice
with trembling.</HI> Throughout every age,
he hath pointed his peculiar displeasure
against the confidence of presumption,
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
and the arrogance of prosperity. He hath
pronounced, that <HI>whosoever exalteth him∣self
shall be abased.</HI> And shall neither the
admonitions which you receive from the
visible inconstancy of the world, nor the
declarations of the divine displeasure, be
sufficient to check your thoughtless career?
Know, that by your impiety, you mul∣tiply
the dangers which already threaten
you on every side; you accelerate the
speed with which the changes of the world
advance to your destruction. The Al∣mighty
touches with his rod that edifice
of dust, on which you stand, and boast of
your strength; and at that instant, it
crumbles to nothing.</P>
<P>As men then, bethink yourselves of hu∣man
instability. As Christians, reverence
the awful government of God. Insure
your prosperity, by consecrating it to
religion and virtue. Be humble in your
elevation; be moderate in your views;
be submissive to him who hath raised and
distinguished you. Forget not, that on
his providence you are as dependent, and
to the obedience of his laws as much
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
bound, as the meanest of your fellow∣creatures.
Disgrace not your station, by
that grossness of sensuality, that levity of
dissipation, or that insolence of rank, which
bespeak a little mind. Let the af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ability
of your behaviour, show that you remem∣ber
the natural equality of men. Let
your moderation in pleasure, your com∣mand
of passion, and your steady regard
to the great duties of life, show that you
possess a mind worthy of your fortune.
Establish your character on the basis of
esteem; not on the flattery of dependents,
or the praise of sycophants, but on the
respect of the wise and the good. Let in∣nocence
preside over your enjoyments. Let
usefulness and beneficence, not ostentation
and vanity, direct the train of your pur∣suits.
Let <HI>your alms, together with your
prayers, come up in memorial before God.</HI>
So shall your prosperity, under the bles∣sing
of Heaven, be <HI>as the shining light
which shineth more and more unto the per∣fect
day.</HI> So shall it resemble those cele∣stial
fires which glow above with benefi∣cent,
with regular, and permanent lustre;
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
and not prove that <HI>mirth of fools,</HI> which
by Solomon is compared to <HI>the crackling
of thorns under a pot,</HI> a glittering and fer∣vent
blaze, but speedily extinct.</P>
<P>On the whole, let this be our conclu∣sion,
that both in prosperity and in ad∣versity,
religion is the safest guide of
human life. Conducted by its light, we
reap the pleasures, and at the same time
escape the dangers, of a prosperous state.
Sheltered under its protection, we stand
the shock of adversity with most intrepi∣dity,
and suffer least from the violence of
the storm. <HI>He that desireth life, and loveth
many days that he may see good, let him keep
his tongue from evil, and his lips from guile.
Let him depart from evil, and do good. Let
him seek peace with God, and pursue it.</HI>
Then, in his adversity, <HI>God shall hide him
in his pavilion.</HI> In his prosperity, <HI>he shall
flourish like a tree planted by the rivers of
water. The ungodly are not so; but are
like the chaff,</HI> light and vile, <HI>which the
the wind driveth away.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On our imperfect knowledge of a Future State.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTH. xiii. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>For now we see through a glass, darkly.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle here describes the im∣perfection
of our knowledge with
relation to spiritual and eternal objects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE>
He employs two metaphors, to represent
more strongly the disadvantages under
which we lie: One, that we see those ob∣jects
<HI>through a glass,</HI> that is, through the
intervention of a medium which obscures
their glory; the other, that we see them
<HI>in a riddle</HI> or aenigma, which our transla∣tors
have rendered by seeing them <HI>darkly,</HI>
that is, the truth in part discovered, in
part concealed, and placed beyond our
comprehension.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="94"/>
This description, however just and true,
cannot fail to occasion some perplexity
to an enquiring mind. For it may seem
strange, that so much darkness should be
left upon those celestial objects, towards
which we are at the same time command∣ed
to aspire. We are strangers in the
universe of God. Confined to that spot
on which we dwell, we are permitted to
know nothing of what is transacting in
the regions above us and around us. By
much labour we acquire a superficial ac∣quaintance
with a few sensible objects
which we find in our present habitation;
but we enter, and we depart, under a total
ignorance of the nature and laws of
the spiritual world. One subject in par∣ticular,
when our thoughts proceed in
this train, must often recur upon the
mind with peculiar anxiety; that is, the
immortality of the soul, and the future
state of man. Exposed as we are at pre∣sent
to such a variety of afflictions, and
subjected to so much disappointment in
all our pursuits of happiness, Why, it
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
may be said, has our gracious Creator
denied us the consolation of a full disco∣very
of our future existence, if indeed
such an existence be prepared for us?—
Reason, it is true, suggests many argu∣ments
in behalf of immortality; Revela∣tion
gives full assurance of it. Yet even
that gospel which is said to have <HI>brought
life and immortality to light,</HI> allows us to
see only through a glass, darkly. It doth
not yet appear what we <HI>shall be.</HI> Our
knowledge of a future world, is very im∣perfect;
our ideas of it, are faint and con∣fused.
It is not displayed in any such
manner, as to make an impression suited
to the importance of the object. The
faith even of the best men, is much infe∣rior,
both in clearness and in force, to
the evidence of sense; and proves, on
many occasions, insufficient to counter∣balance
the temptations of the present
world. Happy moments indeed there
sometimes are in the lives of pious men,
when sequestered from worldly cares, and
born up on the wings of divine contem∣plation,
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
they rise to a near and trans∣porting
view of immortal glory. But
such efforts of the mind are rare, and
cannot be long supported. When the
spirit of meditation subsides, this lively
sense of a future state decays; and though
the general belief of it remain, yet when
they return to the ordinary business and
cares of life, good men themselves seem
to rejoin the multitude, and to re-assume
the same hopes, and fears, and interests,
which influence the rest of the world.</P>
<P>From such reflections, no small difficulty
respecting this important subject, either
arises, or seems to arise. Was such an
obscure and imperfect discovery of a fu∣ture
state worthy to proceed from God?
Does it not afford some ground, either to
tax his goodness, or to suspect the evi∣dence
of its coming from him?—This is
the point which we are now to consider;
and let us consider it with that close at∣tention
which the subject merits. Let us
enquire, whether we have any reason, ei∣ther
to complain of Providence, or to ob∣ject
to the evidence of a future state, be∣cause
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
that evidence is not of a more sen∣sible
and striking nature. Let us attempt
humbly to trace the reasons, why, though
permitted to know and to see somewhat
of the eternal world, we are nevertheless
permitted only to <HI>know in part,</HI> and <HI>to see
through a glass, darkly.</HI></P>
<P>IT plainly appears to be the plan of the
Deity, in all his dispensations, to mix
light with darkness, evidence with uncer∣tainty.
Whatever the reasons of this pro∣cedure
be, the fact is undeniable. He is
described in the Old Testament, as <HI>a God
that hideth himself</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlv. 15.</NOTE>. <HI>Clouds and darkness</HI>
are said to <HI>surround him. His way is in the
sea, and his path in the great waters; his
footsteps are not known.</HI> Both the works
and the ways of God are full of mystery.
In the ordinary course of his government,
innumerable events occur which perplex
us to the utmost. There is a certain limit
to all our enquiries in religion, beyond
which if we attempt to proceed, we are
lost in a maze of inextricable difficulties.
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
Even that revelation which affords such
material instruction to man, concerning
his duty and his happiness, leaves many
doubts unresolved. Why it was not given
sooner; why not to all men; why there
should be so many things in it <HI>hard to be
understood,</HI> are difficulties not inconsiderable
in the midst of that incontestable evidence
by which it is supported. If, then, the
future state of man be not placed in so
full and clear a light as we desire, this is
no more than what the analogy of all re∣ligion,
both natural and revealed, gave
us reason to expect.</P>
<P>But such a solution of the difficulty will
be thought imperfect. It may, perhaps,
not give much satisfaction, to show that
all religion abounds with difficulties of a
like nature. Our situation, it will be said,
is so much the more to be lamented, that
not on one side only we are confined in
our enquiries, but on all hands environed
with mysterious obscurity.—Let us then,
if so much dissatisfied with our condition,
give scope for once to Fancy, and consider
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
how the plan of Providence might be
rectified to our wish. Let us call upon the
Sceptic, and desire him to say, what mea∣sure
of information would afford him en∣tire
satisfaction.</P>
<P>This, he will tell us, requires not any
long or deep deliberation. He desires on∣ly
to have his view enlarged beyond the
limits of this corporeal state. Instead of
resting upon evidence which requires dis∣cussion,
which must be supported by much
reasoning, and which, after all, he alledges
yields very imperfect information, he de∣mands
the everlasting mansions to be so dis∣played,
if in truth such mansions there be,
as to place faith on a level with the evidence
of sense. What noble and happy effects, he
exclaims, would instantly follow, if man
thus beheld his present and his future
existence at once before him! He would
then become worthy of his rank in the
creation. Instead of being the sport, as
now, of degrading passions and childish
attachments, he would act solely on the
principles of immortality. His pursuit
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
of virtue would be steady; his life would
be undisturbed and happy. Superior to
the attacks of distress, and to the solicita∣tions
of pleasure, he would advance, by a
regular progress, towards those divine re∣wards
and honours which were continu∣ally
present to his view.—Thus Fancy,
with as much ease and confidence as if it
were a perfect judge of creation, erects a
new world to itself, and exults with ad∣miration
of its own work. But let us
pause, and suspend this admirationh, till
we coolly examine the consequences that
would follow from this supposed reform∣ation
of the universe.</P>
<P>Consider the nature and state of man.
Introduced into the world in an indigent
condition, he is supported at first by the
care of others; and, as soon as he begins
to act for himself, finds labour and indu∣stry
to be necessary for sustaining his life,
and supplying his wants. Mutual defence
and interest give rise to society; and so∣ciety,
when formed, requires distinctions
of property, diversity of conditions, sub∣ordination
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
ordination of ranks, and a multiplicity
of occupations, in order to advance the
general good. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervices of the poor,
and the protection of the rich, become
reciprocally necessary. The governors, and
the governed, must co-operate for general
safety. Some arts must be studied to cul
tivate the mind, some to ward off the
evils, and some to provide the convenien∣cies
of life. In a word, by the destina∣tion
of his Creator, and the necessities of
his nature, man commences, at once, an
active, not merely a contemplative being.
Religion assumes him as such. It sup∣poses
him employed in this world, as on
a busy stage. It regulates, but does not
abolish, the enterprizes and cares of ordi
nary life. It addresses itself to the vari
ous ranks in society; to the rich and the
poor, to the magistrate and the subject
It rebukes the slothfull; directs the dili∣gent
how to labour; and requires every
man to <HI>do his own butsiness.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose, now, that veil to be with∣drawn
which conceals another world from
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
our view. Let all obscurity vanish: Let
us no longer see darkly, <HI>as through a glass;</HI>
but let every man enjoy that intuitive
perception of divine and eternal objects,
which the Sceptic was supposed to desire.
The immediate effect of such a discovery
would be, to annihilate in our eye all hu∣man
objects, and to produce a total stag∣nation
in the affairs of the world. Were
the glory of the celestial state opened to
our admiring view; did the angelic har∣mony
sound continually in our enraptured
ears; what earthly concerns could have
the power of engaging our attention for
a single moment? All the studies and pur∣suits,
the arts and labours, which now
employ the activity of man, which sup∣port
the order, or promote the happiness
of society, would lie neglected and aban∣doned.
Those desires and fears, those
hopes and interests by which we are at
present stimulated, would cease to operate.
Human life would present no objects suf∣ficient
to rouse the mind; to kindle the
spirit of enterprize, or to urge the hand
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
of industry. If the mere sense of duty
engaged a good man to take some part in
the business of the world, the task, when
submitted to, would prove distasteful.
Even the preservation of life would be
flighted, if he were not bound to it by
the authority of God. Impatient of his
confinement within this tabernacle of
dust, languishing for the happy day of
his translation to those glorious regions
which were displayed to his sight, he
would sojourn on earth as a melancholy
exile. Whatever Providence has prepared
for the entertainment of man, would be
viewed with contempt. Whatever is now
attractive in human society, would appear
insipid. In a word, he would be no
longer a fit inhabitant of this world, nor
be qualified for those exertions which are
allotted to him in his present sphere of
being. But, all his faculties being subli∣mated
beyond the state of mortality, he
would be in the condition of some being
of superior order, who, obliged to reside
among men, would regard human pur∣suits
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
with inattention and scorn, as dreams,
trifles, and puerile amusements of a day.
But to this reasoning it may perhaps
be replied, that such consequences as I
have now stated, supposing them to fol∣low,
deserve not much regard.—For what
though the present arrangement of human
affairs were entirely changed, by a clearer
view, and stronger impres sion of our fu∣ture
state? Would not such a change
prove the highest blessing to man? Is not
his attachment to worldly objects the
great, source both of his misery and his
guilt? Employed in perpetual contempla∣tion
of heavenly objects, and in prepara∣tion
for the enjoyment of them, would
he not become more virtuous, and of
course more happy, than the nature of his
present employments and attachments
permits him to be?—Allowing, for a
moment, the consequence to be such, this
much is yielded, that upon the supposition
which was made, man would not be the
creature which he now is, nor human life
the state which we now behold. How
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
far the change would contribute to his
improvement, comes to be considered.</P>
<P>It there be any principle fully ascer∣tained
by religion, it is, that this life
was intended for a slate of trial and im∣provement
to man. His preparation for
a better world required a gradual purifi∣cation,
carried on by steps of progressive
improvement. The Situation, therefore,
here assigined him, was such as to answer
this design, by calling forth all his active
powers, by giving full scope to his moral
dispositions, and bringing to light his whole
character. Hence it became proper, that
difficulty and temptation should arise in
the course of his duty. Ample rewards
were promised to virtue; but these re∣wards
left, as yet, in obscurity and di∣stant
prospect. The impressions of sense
were so balanced against the discoveries
of divine objects, as to allow a conflict
between faith and sense, between con∣science
and desire, between present plea∣sure
and future good. In this conflict,
the souls of good men are tried, improved,
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
and strengthened. In this field, their ho∣nours
are reaped. Here are formed the
capital virtues of fortitude, temperance,
and self-denial; moderation in prosperity,
patience in adversity, submission to the
will of God, and charity and forgiveness
to men, amidst the various competitions
of worldly interest.</P>
<P>Such is the plan of Divine Wisdom for
man's improvement. But put the case,
that the plan devised by human wisdom
were to take place, and that the rewards
of the just were to be now fully displayed
to view; the exercise of all those virtues
which I Have mentioned, would be en∣tirely
superseded. Their very names
be unknown. Every temptation
being withdrawn, every worldly attach∣ment
being subduced by the overpowering
discoveries of eternity, no trial of sincerity,
no dicrimination of characters, would
remain; no opportunity would be aff∣orded
for those active exertions, which
are the means of purifying and perfecting
the good. On the competition between
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
time and eternity, depends the chief exer∣cise
of human virtue. The obscurity
which at present hangs over eternal ob∣jects,
preserves the competition. Re∣move
that obscurity, and you remove hu∣man
virtue from its place: You render
human life no longer that state of disci∣pline,
by which imperfect creatures are
gradually sitted for a more perfect state.</P>
<P>Where then do we land at last, but in
this conclusion, that the full display,
which was demanded, of a future state,
would be so far from improving the hu∣man
soul, that it would abolish those vir∣tues
and duties which are the great instru∣ments
of its improvement? It would be
unsuitable to the character of man, in
every view, either as an active being, or
a moral agent. It would disqualify him
for taking part in the affairs of the world;
for relishing the pleasures, or for dischar∣ging
the duties of life: In a word, would
entirely defeat the purpose of his being
placed on this earth. And the question,
Why the Almighty has been pleased to
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
leave a spiritual world, and the future ex∣istence
of man, under so much obscurity,
resolves in the end into this, Why there
should be such a creature as man in the
universe of God?—Such is the issue of
the improvements proposed to be made on
the plans of Providence. They add to
the discoveries of the superior wisdom of
God, and of the presumption and folly
of man.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, it now ap∣pears,
that no reasonable objection to the
belief of a future state arises, from the
imperfect discoveries of it which we en∣joy;
from some difficulties that are min∣gled
with its evidence, from our <HI>seelings as
through a glass darkly</HI> and being left to
<HI>walk by faith and not by sight.</HI> It cannot
be otherwise, it ought not to be other∣wise,
in our present state. The evidence
which is afforded, is sufficient for the con∣viction
of a candid mind, sufficient for a
rational ground of conduct; though not
so striking as to withdraw our attention
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
from the present world, or altogether to
overcome the impression of sensible ob∣jects.
In such evidence it becomes us to
acquiesce, without indulging either doubts
or complaints, on account of our not re∣ceiving
all the satisfaction which we fond∣ly
desire, but which our present imma∣turity
of being allows not. For upon the
supposition of immortality, this life is no
other than the childhood of existence;
and the measures of our knowledge must
needs be proportioned to such a state.
To the successive stages of human life,
from, infancy to old age, belong certain
peculiar attachments, certain cares, de∣fires,
and intercests; which open, not ab∣ruptly,
but by gradual advances, on the
mind, as it becomes fit to receive them,
and is prepared for acting the part to
which, in their order, they pertain.
Hence, in the education of a child, no
one thinks of inspiring him all at once
with the knowledge, the sentiments, and
views of a man, and with contempt for
the exercises and amusements of child∣hood,
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
On the contrary, employments
suited to his age are allowed to occupy
him. By these, his powers are gradually
unfolded; and advantage is taken of his
youthful pursuits, to improve and strength∣en
his mind.; till, step by step, he is led on
to higher prospects, and prepared for a
larger and more important scene of action.</P>
<P>This analogy, which so happily illustrates
the present conduct of the Deity towards
man, deserves attention the more, as it is
the very illustration used. by the Apostle,
when treating of this subject in the con∣text.
<HI>Now, says he, we know in part∣but
when that which is perfect is come, that
which is in part shall be done away. When
I was a child, I spake as a child, I under∣stood
as a child, I thought as a child; but
when I became a man, I put away childish
things. For now we see through a glass,
darkly; but then, face to face: Now I know
in part; but then, I shall know even as I am
known.</HI> Under the care of the Almighty,
our education is now going on, from a
mortal to an immortal state. As much
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
light is let in upon us, as we can bear
without injury. When the objects be∣come
too splendid and dazzling for our
sight, the curtain is drawn. Exercised
in such a field of action, as suits the
strength of our unripened powers, we are,
at the same time, by proper prospects and
hopes, prompted to aspire towards the
manhood of our nature, the time when
<HI>childish things shall be put away.</HI> But still,
betwixt those future prospects, and the
impression of present objects, such an ac∣curate
proportion is etablished, as on the
one hand shall not produce a total con∣tempt
of earthly things, while we aspire
to those that are heavenly; and on the
other, shall not encourage such a degree
of attachment to our present state, as
would render us unworthy of future ad∣vancement.
In a word, the whole course
of things is so ordered, that we may nei∣ther
by an irregular and precipitate edu∣cation,
become men too soon; nor by a
fond and trifling indulgence, be suffered
to continue children for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="112"/>
LET these reflections not only remove
the doubts which may arise from our
obscure knowledge of immortality, but
likewise produce the highest admiration
of the wisdom of our Creator. The struc∣ture
of the natural world affords innume∣rable
instances of profound design, which
no attentive spectator can survey without
wonder. In the moral world, where the
workmanship is of much finer and more
delicate contexture, subjects of still great∣er
admiration open to view. But admi∣ration
must rise to its highest point, when
those parts of the moral constitution which
at first were reputed blemishes, which car∣ried
the appearance of objections, either
to the wisdom or the goodness of Provi∣dence,
are discovered, on more accurate
inspection, to be adjusted with the most
exquisite propriety. We have now seen,
that the darkness of man's present state is
no less essential to his well-being, than
the light which he enjoys. His internal
powers, and his external situation, appear
to be exactly sitted to each other. Those
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
complaints, which we are apt to make of
our limited capacity and narrow views, of
our inability to penetrate farther into the
future destination of man, are found, from
the foregoing observations, to be just as
unreasonable, as the childish complaints
of our not being formed with a micro∣scopic
eye, nor furnished with an eagle's
wing; that is, of not being endowed with
powers which would subvert the nature,
and counteract the laws of our present state.</P>
<P>In order to do justice to the subject, I
must observe, that the same reasoning
which has been now employed with
respect to our knowledge of immorta∣lity,
is equally applicable to many other
branches of intellectual knowledge. Thus,
why we are permitted to know so little of
the nature of that Eternal Being who rules
the universe; why the manner in which
he operates on the natural and moral
world, is wholly concealed; why we are
kept in such ignorance with respect to
the extent of his works, to the nature and
agency of spiritual beings, and even with
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
respect to the union between our own soul
and body: To all these, and several other
enquiries of the same kind, which, often
employ the solicitous researches of spe∣culative
men, the answer is the same that
was given to the interesting question which
made the subject of our discourse. The
degree of knowledge desired, would prove
incompatible with the design, and the
proper business of human life. It would
raise us to a sphere too exalted; would
reveal objects too great and striking for
our present faculties; would excite feel∣ings
too strong for us to bear; in a word,
would unfit us for thinking or acting like
human creatures. It is therefore reserved
for a more advanced period of our na∣ture;
and the hand of Infinite Wisdom
hath in mercy drawn a veil over scenes
which would overpower the sight of mortals.</P>
<P>One instance, in particular, of Divine
Wisdom, is so illustrious, and corresponds
so remarkably with our present subject,
that I cannot pass over it without notice;
<PB N="106" REF="115"/>
that is, the concealment under which Pro∣vidence
has placed the future events of
our life on earth. The desire of penetrating
into this unknown region, has ever
been one of the most anxious passions of
men. It has often seized the wife as well
as the credulous, and given rise to many
vain and impious superstitions throughout
the whole earth. Burning with curiosity
at the approach of some critical event,
and impatient under the perplexity
of conjecture and doubt, how cruel is Pro∣vidence,
we are apt to exclaim, in deny∣ing
to man the power of fore-sight, and in
limiting him to the knowledge of the pre∣sent
moment? Were he permitted to look
forward into the course of destiny, how
much more suitably would he be prepared
for the various turns and changes in his
life? With what moderation would he en∣joy
his prosperity, under the fore-know∣ledge
of an approaching reverse? And
with what eagerness be prompted to im∣prove
the flying hours, by seeing the in∣evitable
term draw nigh which was to
finish his course?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116"/>
But while Fancy indulges such vain de∣fires
and criminal complaints, this covet∣ed
fore-knowledge must clearly appear to
the eye of reason, to be the most fatal gift
which the Almighty could bestow. If in this
present mixed state, all the successive scenes
of distress through which we are to pass,
were laid before us in one view, perpetual
sadness would overcast our life. Hardly
would any transient gleams of interven∣ing
joy be able to force their way through
the cloud. Faint would be the relish of
pleasures, of which we foresaw the close:
Insupportable the burden of affictions,
under which we were oppressed by the
load not only of present, but of antici∣pated
sorrows. Friends would begin their
union, with lamenting the day which was
to dissolve it; and, with weeping eye, the
parent would every moment behold the
child whom he knew that he was to lose.
In short, as soon as that mysterious veil,
which now covers futurity, was lifted
up, all the gaiety of life would disap∣pear;
its flattering hopes, its pleasing il∣lusions,
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
would vanish; and nothing but
its vanity and sadness remain. The fore∣fight
of the hour of death would interrupt
the whole course of human affairs;
and the overwhelming prospect of the future,
instead of exciting men to proper activity,
would render them immoveable with con∣sternation
and dismay.—How much
more friendly to man is that mixture of
knowledge and ignorance which is allotted
him in this state! Ignorant of the events
which are to befall us, and of the precise
term which is to conclude our life, by
this ignorance our enjoyment of present
objects is favoured; and knowing that
death is certain, and that human affairs
are full of change, by this knowledge our
attachment to those objects is moderated.
Precisely in the same manner as by the
mixture of evidence and obscurity which
remains on the prospect of a future state,
a proper balance is preserved betwixt our
love of this life, and our desire of a better.</P>
<P>The longer that our thoughts dwell on
this subject, the more we must be convin∣ced,
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
that in nothing the Divine Wisdom
is more admirable, than in proportioning
knowledge to the necessities of man. In∣stead
of lamenting our condition, that we
are permitted only to <HI>see as through a glass
darkly,</HI> we have reason to bless our Crea∣tor,
no less for what he hath concealed,
than for what he hath allowed us to know.
He is wonderful in counsel, as he is excellent
in working. <HI>He is wise in heart, and his
thoughts are deep, How unsearchable are
the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge
of God!</HI></P>
<P>FROM the whole view which we have
taken of the subject, this important in∣ftruction
arises, That the great design of
all the knowledge, and in particular of the
religious knowledge which God hath af∣forded
us, is, to fit us for discharging the
duties of life. No useless discoveries are
made to us in religion: No discoveries
even of useful truths, beyond the precise
degree of information, which is subser∣vient
to right conduct. To this great end
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
all our information points. In this center
all the lines of knowledge meet. <HI>Life and
immortality are brought to light in the gospel;</HI>
yet not so displayed as to gratify the cu∣riosity
of the world with an astonishing
spectacle; but only so far made known,
as to assist and support us in the practice
of our duty. If the discovery were more
imperfect, it would excite no desire of
immortality; if it were more full and
striking, it would render us careless of
life. On the first supposition, no sufficient
motive to virtue would appear; on the
second, no proper trial of it would remain.
In the one case, we should think and act
like men who <HI>have their portion only in this
world;</HI> in the other case, like men who
have no concern with this world at all.
Whereas now, by the wise constitution of
Heaven, we are placed in the most favour∣able
situation for acting, with propriety,
our allotted part here; and for rising, in
due course, to higher honour and happi-ness
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="120"/>
Let us then second the kind intentions
of Providence, and act upon the plan
which it hath pointed out. Checking our
inquisitive solicitude about what the Al∣mighty
hath concealed, let us diligently
improve what he hath made knnown. In∣habitants
of the earth, we are at the same
time candidates for heaven. Looking up∣on
these as only different views of one
consistent character, let us carry on our
preparation for heaven, not by abstract∣ing
ourselves from the concerns of this
world, but by fulfilling the duties and of∣fices
of every station in life. Living <HI>so∣berly
righteously, and godly in the present
world, let us look for that blessed hope and
the glorious appearing of the great God, and
our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI>
Before I conclude, it may be proper to
observe, that the reassnings in this dis∣course
give no ground to apprehend any
danger of our being too much influenced
by the belief of a future state. I have
shown the hurtful effects which would
follow from too bright and full a disco∣very
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
of the glory of that state; and in
showing this, I have justified the decree
of Providence which permits no such dis∣covery.
But as our nature is at present
constituted, attached by so many strong
connexions to the world of sense, and en∣joying
a communication so feeble and di∣stant
with the world of spirits; we need
fear no danger from cultivating inter∣course
with the latter as much as possible.
On the contrary, from that intercourse
the chief security of our virtue is to be
sought. The biass of our nature leans so
much towards sense, that from this side
the peril is to be dreaded, and on this
side the defence to be provided.
Let us then <HI>walk by faith.</HI> Let us
strengthen this principle of action to the
utmost of our power. Let us implore the
Divine Grace, to strengthen it within us
more and more: That we may thence
derive an antidote against that subtle poi∣son,
which incellant commerce with the
objects of sense diffuses through our souls;
that we may thence acquire purity and dignity
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
dignity of manners, suited to our divine
hopes; and, undefiled by the pleasures of
the world, unshaken by its terrors, may
preserve to the end one constant tenor of
integrity. Till at last, having, under the
conduct of Christian faith, happily finish∣ed
the period of discipline, we enter on
that state where a far nobler scene shall
open; where eternal objects shall shine in
their native splendour; where, this twi∣light
of mortal life being past, the <HI>Sun of
righteousness shall rise; and that which is
perfect being come that which is in part
shall be done away.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN xvii. I.</BIBL>
<Q>Jesus lift up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, The hour is come;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE were the words of our blessed
Lord on a memorable occassion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM V.</NOTE> The
feast of the passover drew nigh, at which
he knew that he was to suffer. The night
was arrived, wherein he was to be deliver∣ed
into the hands of his enemies. He
had spent the evening in conference with
his disciples; like a dying father in the
midst of his family, mingling consola∣tions
with his laft instructions. When he
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
had ended his discourse to them, he lifted
up his eyes to heaven, and, with the words
which I have now read, began that solemn
interces sory prayer which closed his mi∣nistry.
Immediately after, he went forth
with his disciples into the garden of
Gethsemane, and surrendered himself to
those who came to apprehend him.
Such was the situation of our Lord at
the time of his pronouncing these words.
He saw his mission on the point of being
accomplished. He had the prospect full
before him, of all that he was about to
suffer.—<HI>Father, the hour is come!</HI>—What
hour? An hour the most critical, the
most pregnant with great events, since
hours had begun to be numbered, since
time had begun to run. It was the hour
in which the son of God was to termi∣nate
the labours of his important life, by
a death still more important and illustri∣ous;
the hour of atoning, by his suffer∣ings,
for the guilt of mankind; the hour
of accomplishing prophecies, types, and
Symbols, which had been carried on thro'
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
a feries of ages; the hour of concluding
the old, and introducing to the world the
new dispensation of religion; the hour
of his triumphing over the world,. and
death, and hell; the hour of his erecting
that spiritual kingdom which is to last for
ever. Such is the hour, such are the
events which you are to commemorate
in the sacrament of our Lord's Supper.
I shall attempt to set them before you as
proper subjects, at this time, of your
devout meditation. To display them, in
their genuine majesty, is beyond the abi∣lity
of man.</P>
<P>I. This was the hour in which Christ
was glorified by his sufferings. The whole
of his life had discovered much real great∣ness
under a mean appearance. Through
the cloud of his humiliation, his native
lustre often broke forth; but never did it
shine so bright, as in this last, this trying
hour. It was indeed the hour of distress
and of blood. He knew it to be such; and
when the uttered the worlds of the Text,
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
he had before his eyes the executioner and
the cross, the scourge, the nails, and the
spear. But by such prospects his soul was
not to be overcome. It is distress which
ennobles every great character; and distress
was to glorify the Son of God. He was
now to teach all mankind, by his example,
how to suffer and to die. He was to
stand forth before his enemies as the
faithful Witness of the truth; justifying
by his behaviour the character which he
assumed, and sealing with his blood the
doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P>What magnanimity in all his words
and actions on this great occasion! The
court of Herod, the judgement-hall of
Pilate, the hill of Calvary, were so many
theatres prepared for his dislaying all the
virtues of a constant and a patient mind.
When led forth to suffer, the first voice
which we hear from him, is a generous
lamentation over the fate of his un∣fortunate,
though guilty, country; and
to the last moment of his life, we behold
him in possession of the same gentle and
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>
benevolent spirit. No upbraiding, no
complaining expression escaped from his
lips, during the long and painful ap∣proaches
of a cruel death. He betrayed
no symptom of a weak or a vulgar, of a
discomposed or impatient mind. With
the utmost attention of filial tenderness, he
committed his aged mother to the care of
his beloved disciple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See John xix. 26, 27.</NOTE> With all the dig∣nity
of a Sovereign, he conferred pardon
on a penitent fellow-fufferer. With a
greatness of mind beyond example, he
spent his last moments in apologies and
prayers, for those who were shedding his
blood.</P>
<P>By wonders in heaven, and wonders
on earth, was this hour distinguished.
All nature seemed to feel it; and the dead
and the living bore witness to its import∣ance.
The veil of the temple was rent in
twain. The earth shook. There was
darkness over all the land. The graves
were opened, and many who slept arose and
went into the Holy City. Nor were these
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
the only prodigies of this awful hour.
The most hardened hearts were subdued
and changed. The Judge, who in order
to gratify the multitude pas sed sentence
against the multitude passed sentence
against him, publickly attested his innocence.
The Roman centurion, who pre∣sided
at the execution, glorisied God, and
acknowledged the sufferer to be more
than man. After he saw the things which
had passed, he said, Certainly this was a
righteous person; truly, this was the son of
God. The Jewish malefactor, who was
crucified with him, addressed him as a
King, and implored his favour. Even
the crowd of insensible spectators, who
had come forth as to a common spectacle,
and who began with clamours and in∣sults,
returned home, smiting their breafs.
Look back on the heroes, the philoso∣phers,
the legislators of old. View them
in their last moments. Recall every
circumstance which distinguished their de∣parture
from the world. Where can you
find such assmblage of high virtues,
and of great events, as concurred at the
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
death of Christ? Where, so many testi∣monies
given to the dignity of the dying
person, by earth, and by heaven?</P>
<P>II. THIS was the hour in -which Christ
atoned for the fins of mankind, and ac∣complished
our eternal redemption. It
was the hour when that great sacrifice
was offered up, the efficacy of which
reaches back to the first transgression. of
man, and extends forward to the end of
time; the hour, when from the cross, as
from an high altar, that blood was flow∣ing,
which washed away the guilt of the
nations.</P>
<P>This awful dispensation of the Almighty,
contains mysteries which are beyond
the discovery of man. It is one of those
things into which the angels desire to look.
What has been revealed to us, is, That
the death of Christ was the interposition
of Heaven for preventing the ruin of hu∣man
kind. We know, that under the go∣vernment
of God, misery is the natural
consequence of guilt. After rational crca∣tures
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>
had, by their criminal conduct, in∣troduced
disorder into the divine king∣dom,
there was no ground to imagine,
that by their penitence and prayers alone,
they could prevent the destruction which
threatened them. The prevalence of pro∣pitiatory
sacrifices throughout the earth,
proclaims it to be the general sense of
mankind, that mere repetance was not
of sufficient avail to expiate sin, or to stop
its penal effects. By the constant allu∣sions
which are carried on in the New
Testament to the sacrifices under the Law,
as pre-signifying a great atonement made
by Christ; and by the strong expressions
which are used in describing the effects of
his death, the sacred writers show, as
plainly as language allows, that there was
an efficacy inhis sufferings, far beyond
that of mere example and instruction.
The nature and extent of that efficacy we
are unable, as yet, fully to trace. Part
we are capable of beholding; and the
wisdom of what we behold, we have rea∣son
to adore. We discern, in this plan of
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
redemption, the evil of sin strongly exhi∣bited;
and the justice of the divine go∣vernment
awfully exemplified, in Christ
suffering for sinners. But let us not ima∣gine,
that our present discoveries unfold
the whole influence of the death of Christ.
It is connected with causes into which we
cannot penetrate. It produces consequen∣ces
too extensive for us to explore. God's
thoughts are not as our thoughts. In all
things, we see only in part; and here, if
any where, we see also as through a glass,
darkly.</P>
<P>This, however, is fully manifest, that
redemption is one of the most glorious
works of the Almighty. If the hour of
the creation of the world was great and
illustrious; that hour, when from the
dark and formless mass, this fair system
of nature arose at the divine command;
when the morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy; no less
illustrious is the hour of the restoration of
the world; the hour when from condemn∣ation
and misery it emerged into happi∣ness
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
and peace. With less external ma∣jesty
it was attended; but is, on that ac∣count,
the more worderful, that under
an appearance so simple, such great events
were convered.
I. In this hour, the long series of
prophecies, visions, types, and figures,
was accomplished. This was the center
in which they all met: This the pooint,
towards which they had tended and
verged, throught the course of so
many generations. You behold the Law
and the Prophets standing, if we may
speak so, at the foot of the cross, and
doing homage. You behold Moses and
Aaron bearing the ark of the convenant;
David and Elijah presenting the oracle
of testimony. You behold all the priests
and sacrifices, all the rites and ordinan∣ces,
all the types and symbols, assem∣bled
together to receive their consum∣mation.
Without the death of Christ, the
worship and ceremonies of the law would
have remained a pompous, but unmean∣ing
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
institution. In the hour when he was
crucified, the book with the seven seals was
opened. Every rite assumed its sigfi∣cancy;
every prediction met its event;
every symbol displayed its corresspond∣ence.</P>
<P>The dark, and seemingly ambiguous
method of conveying important discove∣ries
under figures and emblems, was not
peculiar to the sacred books. The Spirit
of God, in pre-fignifying the death of
Christ, adopted the same plan, according
to which the whole knowledge of those
early ages was propagated through the
world. Under the veil of mysterious al∣lusion,
all wisdom was then concealed.
From the sensible world, images were
every where borrowed, to describe things
unseen. More was understood to be
meant, than was openly expressed. By
aenigmatical rites, the Priest communica∣ted
his doctrines; by parables and alle∣gories,
the Philosopher instructed his dis∣ciples;
even the Legislator by figurative
sayings, commanded the reverence of the
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
people. Agreeably to this prevailing
mode of instruction, the whole dispen∣sation
of the Old Testament was so con∣ducted,
as to be the shadow and the
figure of a spiritual system. Every re∣markable
event, every distinguished per∣sonage,
under the Law, is interpreted in
the New Testament, as bearing some refe∣rence
to the hour of which we treat. If
Isaac was laid upon the altar as an inno∣cent
victim; if David was driven from
his throne by the wicked, and restored
by the hand of God; if the brazen ser∣pent
was listed up, to heal the people; if
the rock -was smitten by Moses, to furnish
drink in the wilderness; all were types
of Christ, and alluded to his death.</P>
<P>In predicting the. same event, magni∣ficent,
but seemingly contradictory, was
the language of ancient prophecy; For it
foretold a Messiah, who was to be at once
a sufferer and a conqueror. The Star was
to come out of Jacob, and the Branch to
spring from the stem of Jes se. The Angel of
the Covenant, the Desire of all Nations, was
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
to come suddenly to his temple; and to him
was to be the gathering of the people. Yet
at the same time, he was to be despised and
rejected of men; he was to be taken from
prison, and from judgment; and to be led
as a lamb to the slaughter. Though he was
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief,
yet the Gentiles were to come to his light,
and Kings to the brightness of his rising. In
the hour when Christ died, those prophe∣tical
riddles were solved; those seeming
contradictions were reconciled. The ob∣scurity
of oracles, and the ambiguity of
types, vanished. The Sun of righteoushness
rose; and, together with the dawn of
religion, those shadows passed away.</P>
<P>IV. THIS was the hour of the abolition
of the Law, and the introduction of the
Gospel; the hour of terminating the old,
and of beginning the new dispensation of
religious knowledge and worship, through∣out
the earth. Viewed in this light, it forms the most
august aera which is to be
found in the history of mankind. When
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>
Christ was suffering on the cross, we are
informed by one of the Evangelists, that
he said, I thirst; and that they filled a
spunge with vinegar, and put it to his
mouth. After he had tasted the vinegar,
knowing that all things were now accom∣plished
and the scripture fulfilled, he said,
It is finished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See John xix. 28, 29, 30.</NOTE>—; that is, This offered
draught of vinegar was the last circurn∣stance
predicted by an ancient Prophet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pfal. Lxix. 21</NOTE>,
that remained to be fulfilled. The vision
and the prophecy are now sealed. The
Mosaic dispensation is closed. And he
bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
It is finished—When he uttered these
words, he changed the state of the uni∣verse.
At that moment, the Law ceased,
and the Gospel commenced. This was
the ever-memorable point of time, which
separated the old and the new world from
each other. On one side of the point of
separation, you. behold the Law, with its
priests, its sacrifices, and its rites, retiring
from fight. On the other side, you behold
the
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
the Gospel, with its simple and venerable
institutions, coming forward into view.
In this hour, the veil of the temple was
rent; and the glory departed from be∣tween
the cherubims. The legal High
Priest delivered up his Urim and his
Thummim, his breast-plate, his robes,
and his incense: And CHRIST stood forth
as the Great High Priest of all succeeding
generations. By that one sacrifice which
he now offered, he abolished sacrifices for
ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed
for ages, were now to smoke no more.
Victims were no more to bleed. <HI>Not with
the blood of bulls and goats, but with his
own blood, he now entered; into the Holy
Place, there to appear in the prfence of God
for us.</HI></P>
<P>This was the hour of association and
union to all the worshippers of God.
When Christ said, It is finished, he threw
down the wall of partition which had so
long divided the Gentile from the Jew.
He gathered into one, all the faithful, out
of every kindred and people. He pro∣claimed
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>
the hour to be come, when the
knowledge of the true God should be no
longer confined to one nation, nor his
worship to one temple; but over all the
earth, the worshippers of the Father should
serve him in spirit and in truth. From that
hour, they who dwelt in the uttermost ends
of the earth, strangers to the covenant of
promise, began to be brought nigh. In that
hour, the light of the Gospel dawned from
afar on the British Islands.</P>
<P>During a long course of ages, Provi∣dence
seemed to be occupied in prepar∣ing
the world for this revolution. The
whole Jewish oeconomy was intended to
usher it in. The knowledge of God was
preserved unextinguished in one corner of
the world, that from thence, in due time,
might issue forth the light which was to
overspread the earth. Successive revela∣tions
gradually enlarged the views of
men beyond the narrow bounds of Judaea,
to a more extensive kingdom of God.
Signs and miracles awakened their ex∣pectation,
and directed their eyes towards
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>
this great event. Whether God descend∣ed
on the flaming mountain, or spoke by
the Prophet's voice; whether he scattered
his chosen people into captivity, or re∣ssemblel
them in their own. land; he was
still carrying on a progressive plan, which
was accomplished at the death of Christ.</P>
<P>Not only in the territories of Israel, but
over all the earth, the great dispensations
of Providence respected the approach of
this important hour. If empires rose or
fell; if war divided, or peace united the
nations; if learning civilized their man∣ners,
or philosophy enlarged their views;
all was, by the secret decree of Heaven,
made to ripen the world for that fulness
of time, when Christ was to publish the
whole counsel of God. The Persian, the
Macedonian, the Roman Conqueror, en∣tered
upon the stage, each at his predict∣ed
period; and, though he meant not so
neither did his heart think, so ministered.
to this hour. The revolutions of power,
and the succession of monarchies, were so
arranged by Providence, as to facilitate
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
the progress of the Gospel through the
habitable world, after the day had arrived,
when the stone which was cut out of the
mountain, without hands, should become a
great mountain, and fill the earth<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Dan. Ii. 34, 35.</NOTE>. This
was the day, which Abraham faw afar off,
and was glad. This was the day, which
many Prophets and Kings, and righteous men9
desired to see, but could not; the day for
which the earnest expectation of the creature,
long oppressel with ignorance, and
bewildered in superstition, might be just∣ly
said to wait.
IV. THIS was the hour of Christ's tri∣umph
over all the powers of darkness;
the hour in which he overthrew domi∣nions
and thrones, led captivity captive,
and gave gifts unto men. The contest which
the kingdom of darkness had long car∣ried
on against the kingdom of light, was
now brought to its crisis. The period
was come, when the feed of the woman
should bruife the head of the serpent. For
many ages, the most gross superstitution had
<PB N="132" REF="141"/>
filled the earth. The glory of the uncorrupt∣ible
God ivas every where, except in the
land of Judaea, changed into images made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
beafts, and creeping things. The world,
which the Almighty created for himself,
seemed to have become a temple of idols.
Even to vices and passions, altars were
raised; and what was intitled Religion,
was in effect a discipline of impurity.
In the midst of this universal darkness,
Satan had erected his throne; and the
learned and polished, as well as the fa∣vage
nations, bowed down before him.
But at the hour when Christ appeared on
the cross, the signal of his defeat was
given. His kingdom suddenly departed
from him; the reign of idolatry passed
away; He was beheld to fall like lightening
from heaven. In that hour, the founda∣tion
of every Pagan temple shook. The
statue of every false God tottered on its
base. The Priest fled from his falling
shrine; and the Heathen oracles became
dumb for ever.
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>
As on the cross Christ triumphed over
Satan, so he overcame his auxiliary, the
world. Long had it assailed him with
its temptations and discouragements. In
this hour of severe trial, he surmounted
them all. Formerly head despised the
pleasures of the world. He now bassled
its terrors. Hence he is justly said to have
crucified the world. By his sufferings, he
ennobled diftress; and he darkened the
lustre of the pomp and vanities of life.
He discovered to his followers, the path
which leads, through affiction, to glory
and to victory; and he imparted to them
the same spirit which enabled him to
overcome. My kingdom is not of this worlds.
In this ulorld ye shall have tribulation: But
be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Death also, the last foe, of man, was
the victim of this hour. The formidable
appearance of the Spectre remained; but
his dart was taken away. For, in the
hour when Christ expiated guilt, he dis∣armed
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
death, by securing the resurrection
of the just. When he said to his peni∣tent
fellow-sufferer, To-day thou shalt be
with me in paradise, he announced to all
his followers the certainty of heavenly
bliss. He declared the cherubims to be
dismissed, and the flaming sword to be
sheathed, which had been appointed at
the fall, to keep from man the way of the
Tree of Life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 24</NOTE>. Faint, before this period,
had been the hope, indistinct the prospect,
which even good men enjoyed of the
heavenly kingdom. Life and immortality
were now brought to light. From the hill
of Calvary, the first clear and certain
view was given to the world of the ever∣lasting
mansions. Since that hour, they
have been the perpetual confolation of
believers in Christ. Under trouble, they
sooth their minds; amidst temptation,
they support their virtue; and, in their
dying moments, enable them to fay, O
Death! where is thy sting? O Grave! where
is thy victory?</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="144"/>
IV. THIS was the hour when our Lord
erected that spiritual kingdom which is
never to end. How vain are the counsels
and designs of men! How shallow is the
policy of the wicked! How short their
triumphing! The enemies of Christ ima∣gined,
that in this hour they had success∣fully
accomplished their plan for his de∣struction.
They believed, that they had
entirely scattered the small party of his
followers, and had extinguifhed his name
and his honour for ever. In derision, they
addressed him as a King. They cloath∣ed
him with purple robes; they crowned
him with a crown of thorns; they put a
reed into his hand; and, with insulting
mockery, bowed the knee before him.
Blind and impious men! How little did
they know, that the Almighty was at that
moment setting him as King on the hill of
Sion; giving him the Heathen, for his inheri∣tance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for
his possession! How little did they know,
that their badges of mock royalty were at
that moment converted into the signals of
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>
absolute dominion, and the instruments of
irresistable power! The reed which they
put into his hands,. became a rod of iron,
with which he was to break in pieces his
enemies; a sceptre, with which he was to
rule the universe in righteousness.
The cross, which they thought was to stigma∣tize
him with infamy, became the ensign
of his renown. Instead of being the
reproach of his followers, it was to be
their boast and their glory. The cross
was to shine on palaces and churches,
throughout the earth. It was to be as∣sumed
as the distinction of the most
powerful monarchs, and to wave in the
banner of victorious armies, when the
memory of Herod and Pilate should be
accursed; when Jerusalem should be re∣duced
to athes, and, the Jews be vaga∣bonds
over all the world.</P>
<P>These were the triumphs which com∣menced
at this hour. Our Lord saw them
already in their birth; <HI>he saw of the tra∣vail
of soul, and was satissied.</HI> He be∣held
the word of God going forth, con∣quering,
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>
and to conquer; subduing to
the obedience of his laws, the subuers
of the world; carrying light into the re∣gions
of darkness, and mildness into the
habitations of cruelty. He beheld the
Gentiles waiting below the cross, to re∣ceive
the Gospel. He beheld Ethiopia,
and the Isles stretching out their hands to
God; the desart beginning to rejoice, and to
blossom as the rose; and the knowledge of the
Lord filling the earth, as the waters cover
the sea. “Well pleased, he said, It is finish∣ed.
As a conqueror, he retired from the
field, reviewing his triumphs: He bowed
his head, and gave up the ghost.—From
that hour, Christ was no longer a mortal
man, but Head overall things to the Church;
the glorious King of men and angels,
of whose dominion there shall be no end.
His triumphs shall perpetually increase.
His name shall endure for ever; it shall last
as long as the sun; men shall be blessed in
him, and all nations shall call him blessed.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="147"/>
SUCH were the transactions, such the
effects of this ever-memorable hour.
With all those great events was the mind of our
Lord filled, when he lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and Said, Father, the hour is come!
From the view which we Have taken of
this Subject, permit me to suggest, what
ground it affords to confide in the mercy
of God for the pardon of sin, to trust
to his faithfulness for the accomplishment
of all his promises, and to approach to
him, with gratitude and devotion, in
acts of worship.</P>
<P>IN the<SEG REND="decorInit">f</SEG>irst place, The death of Christ
affords us ground to confide in the divine
mercy, for the pardon of sin. All the
steps of that high dispensation of Provi∣dence,
which we have considered, lead
directly to this conclusion, He that spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all, how shall he not with him also freely
give us all things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom, viii. 32.</NOTE>'? This is the final result
of the discoveries of the Gospel. On this
rests that great system of consolation,
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
which it hath reared up for men.
We are not left to dubious and intricate rea∣sonings,
concerning the conduct which
God may be expected to hold towards his
offending creatures. But we are led to the
view of important and illustrious facts,
which strike the mind with evidence irre∣sistible.
For, is it possible to believe, that
such great operations as I have endea∣voured
to describe, were carried on by the
Almighty in vain? Did he excite, in the
hearts of his creatures, such high hopes,
without any intention to fulfil them?
After so long a preparation of goodnefs,
could he mean to deny forgiveness to the
penitent, and the humble? When, over∣come
by the sense of guilt, man looks up
with an aslonished eye to the juftice of his
Creator, let him recollect that hour of
which the Text speaks, and be com∣forted.
The signals of divine mercy,
erected in his view, are too conspicuous
to be either distrusted or mistaken.</P>
<P>In the next place, the discoveries of
this hour, afford the highest reason to
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
trust in the divine faithfulnefs, for the
accomplishment of every promise which
remains yet unfulfilled. For this was the
hour of the completion of God's ancient
covenant. It was the performance of the mercy
promised to the fathers. We behold the
consummation of a great plan, which,
throughout a course of ages, had been
uniformly pursued; and which, against
every human appearance, was, at the ap∣pointed
moment, exactly fulfilled. No
word that is gone out of the mouth of the
Lord shall fail. No length of time alters
his purpose. No obftacles can retard it.
Towards the ends accomplished in this
hour, the most repugnant instrument were
made to operate. We discern God bend∣ing
to his purpose, the jarring passions,
the opposite interests, and even the vices
of men; uniting seeming contrarieties in
his scheme; making the wrath of man to
praise him; obliging the ambition of
Princes, the prejudices of the Jews, the
malice of Satan, all to concur, either in
bringing forward this hour, or in com∣pleating
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
its decstined effects. With what
entire confidence ought we to wait for
the fulfilment of all his other promises,
in their due time; even when events are
most embroiled, and the prospect is most
discouraging? Although thou sayest, Thou
canst not see him, yet judgment is before
him; therefore trust thou in him. Be at∣tentive
only to perform thy duty; leave
the event to God; and be assured, that
under the direction of his providence, all things,
all things shall work together for a happy
issue.</P>
<P>LASTLY, The consideration of this
whole subject tends to excite gratitude
and devotion, when we approach to
God in acts of worship. The hour of
which I have discoursed, presents him to
us in the amiable light of the Deliverer
of mankind, the Restorer of our forfeited
hopes. We behold the greatness of the
Almighty, softened by the mild radiance
of condescension and mercy. We behold
him diminishing the awful distance at which
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
which we stand from his presence, by ap∣pointing
for us a Mediator and Intercessor,
through whom the humble may, with∣out
dismay, approach to Him who made
them. By such views of the Divine na∣ture,
Christian faith lays the foundation
for a worship which shall be at once ra∣tional
and affectionate; a worship, in
which the light of the understanding shall
concur with the devotion of the heart,
and the most profound reverence be unit∣ed
with the most cordial love. Christian
faith is not a system of speculative truths.
It is not a lesson of moral instruction on∣ly.
By a train of high discoveries which
it reveals, by a succession of interesting
objects which it places in our view, it is
calculated to elevate the mind, to purify
the affections, and, by the assistance of
devotion, to confirm and encourage vir∣tue.
Such, in particular, is the scope of
that divine institution, the Sacrament of
our Lord's Supper. To this happy pur∣pose
let it conduce, by concentering, in
one striking point of light, all that the
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
Gospel has displayed of what is most im∣portant
to man. Touched with just con∣trition
for past offences, and filled with a
grateful sense of divine goodness, let us
come to the altar of God; and, with a
humble faith in his infinite mercies, de∣vote
ourselves to his service for ever.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES iii. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>The wisdom that is from above, is—gentle—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO be wise in our own eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> to be wise
in the opinion of the world, and
to be wise in the sight of God, are three
things so very different, as rarely to coin∣cide.
One may often be wise in his own
eyes, who is far from being so in the
judgment of the world; and to be reputed
a very wise man by the world, is no se∣curity
for being accounted wise by God.
As there is a worldly happiness, which
God perceives to be no other than dis∣guised
misery; as there are worldly ho∣nours,
which in his estimation are re∣proach;
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
so there is a worldly wisdom
which is <HI>foolishness in his sight.</HI> Of this
worldly wisdom the characters are given
in the context, and placed in contrast
with those of the <HI>wisdom which is from
above.</HI> The one is the wisdom of the
crafty; the other, that of the upright.
The one terminates in selfishness; the
other, in charity. The one is full <HI>of strife
and bitter envyings;</HI> the other, <HI>of mercy
and of good fruits.</HI> One of the chief cha∣racters
by which the wisdom from above
is distinguished, is <HI>gentleness,</HI> of which I
am now to discourse. Of this there is the
greater occasion to discourse, because it is
too seldom viewed in a religious light;
and is more readily considered by the
bulk of men, as a mere felicity of nature,
or an exterior accomplishment of man∣ners,
than as a Christian virtue which
they are bound to cultivate. I shall first
explain the nature of this virtue; and
shall then offer some arguments to re∣commend,
and some directions to faci∣litate
the practice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155"/>
I BEGIN with distinguishing true gen∣tleness
from passive tameness of spirit,
and from unlimited compliance with the
manners of others. That passive tameness
which submits, without struggle, to every
incroachment of the violent and assum∣ing,
forms no part of Christian duty;
but, on the contrary, is destructive of ge∣neral
happiness and order. That unli∣mited
complaisance, which, on every oc∣casion,
falls in with the opinions and
manners of others, is so far from being a
virtue, that it is in itself a vice, and
the parent of many vices. It overthrows
all steadiness of principle; and produces
that sinful conformity with the world,
which taints the whole character. In the
present corrupted state of human man∣ners,
always to assent and to comply, is
the very worst maxim we can adopt. It
is impossible to support the purity and
dignity of Christian morals, without op∣posing
the world on various occasions,
even though we should stand alone. That
gentleness therefore which belongs to vir∣tue,
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
is to be carefully distinguished from
the mean spirit of cowards, and the fawn∣ing
assent of sycophants. It renounces
no just right from fear. It gives up no
important truth from flattery. It is
indeed not only consistent with a firm
mind, but it necessarily requires a manly
spirit, and a fixed principle, in order to
give it any real value. Upon this solid
ground only, the polish of gentleness can
with advantage be superinduced.</P>
<P>It stands opposed, not to the most de∣termined
regard for virtue and truth, but
to harshness and severity, to arrogance
and overbearing, to violence and oppres∣sion.
It is, properly, that part of the
great virtue of charity, which makes us
unwilling to give pain to any of our
brethren. Compassion prompts us to re∣lieve
their wants. Forbearance prevents
us from retaliating their injuries. Meek∣ness
restrains our angry passions; can∣dour,
our severe judgments. Gentleness
corrects whatever is offensive in our man∣ners;
and, by a constant train of humane
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
attentions, studies to alleviate the burden
of common misery. Its office, therefore,
is cxtensive. It is not, like some other
virtues, called forth only on peculiar
emergencies; but it is continually in ac∣tion,
when we are engaged in intercourse
with men. It ought to form our address,
to regulate our speech, and to diffuse it∣self
over our whole behaviour.</P>
<P>I must warn you, however, not to con∣found
this gentle <HI>wisdom which is from
above,</HI> with that artificial courtesy, that
studied smoothness of manners, which is
learned in the school of the world. Such
accomplishments, the most srivolous and
empty may possess. Too often they are
employed by the artful as a snare; too
often affected by the hard and unfeeling,
as a cover to the baseness of their minds.
We cannot, at the same time, avoid ob∣serving
the homage, which, even in such
instances, the spirit of the world is con∣strained
to pay to virtue. In order to
render society agreeable, it is found ne∣cessary
to assume somewhat, that may at
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
least carry its appearance. Virtue is the
universal charm. Even its shadow is
courted, when the substance is wanting.
The imitation of its form has been re∣duced
into an art; and, in the commerce
of life, the first study of all who would
either gain the esteem, or win the hearts
of others, is to learn the speech, and to
adopt the manners, of candour, gentleness,
and humanity. But that gentleness which
is the characteristick of a good man, has,
like every other virtue, its seat in the
heart; And, let me add, nothing except
what flows from the heart, can render
even external manners truly pleasing. For
no assumed behaviour can at all times
hide the real character. In that unaffect∣ed
courtesy which springs from a gentle
mind, there is a charm infinitely more
powerful, than in all the studied manners
of the most finished courtier.</P>
<P>True gentleness is founded on a sense
of what we owe to the God who made us,
and to the common nature of which we
all share. It arises from reflection on our
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
own failings and wants; and from, just
views of the condition, and the duty of
man. It is native feeling, heightened and
improved by principle. It is the heart
which easily relents; which feels for every
thing that is human; and is backward
and flow to inflict the least wound. It is
assable in its address, and mild in its de∣meanour;
ever ready to oblige, and will∣ing
to be obliged by others; breathing
habitual kindness towards friends, cour∣tesy
to strangers, long-suffering to ene∣mies.
It exercises authority with mode∣ration;
administers reproof with tender∣ness;
confers favours with ease and mo∣desty.
It is unassuming in opinion, and
temperate in zeal. It contends not eager∣ly
about trisles; flow to contradict, and
still slower to blame; but prompt to allay
dissention, and to restore peace. It neither
intermeddles unnecessarily with the affairs,
nor pries inquisitively into the secrets, of
others. It delights above all things to
alleviate distress, and, if it cannot dry up
the falling tear, to sooth, at least, the
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
grieving heart. Where it has not the
power of being useful, it is never bur∣densome.
It seeks to please, rather than
to shine and dazzle; and conceals with
care, that superiority either of talents, or
of rank, which is oppressive to those who
are beneath it. In a word, it is that spi∣rit,
and that tenor of manners, which the
Gospel of Christ enjoins, when it com∣mands
us <HI>to bear</HI> one another's burdens; to
rejoice with those who rejoice, and to weep
with those who weep; to please every one
his neighbour for his good; to be kind and
tender-hearted; to be pitiful and courteous;
to support the weak, and to be patient to∣wards
all men.</P>
<P>Having now sufficiently explained the
nature of this amiable virtue, I proceed
to recommend it to your practice. Let
me, for this end, desire you to consider
the duty which you owe to God; to con∣sider
the relation which you bear to one
another; to consider your own interest.</P>
<P>I. Consider the duty which you owe to
God. When you survey his works, no∣thing
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
is so conspicuous, as his greatness
and majesty. When you consult his
word, nothing is more remarkable, than
his attention to soften that greatness, and
to place it in the mildest and least op∣pressive
light. He not only charaterizes
himself as the <HI>God of consolation,</HI> but, with
condescending gentleness, he particularly
accommodates himself to the situation of
the unfortunate. <HI>He dwelleth with the
humble and contrite. He hideth not his face
when the affticted cry. He healeth the broken
in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</HI>—
when his Son came to be the Saviour of
the world, he was eminent for the same
attribute of mild and gentle goodness.
Long before his birth, it was prophesied
of him, that he should <HI>not strive,</HI> nor cry,
nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets;
that the bruised reed he should not break,
nor quench the smoaking flax<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 19, 20.</NOTE>: And after
his death, this distinguishing feature in
his character, was so universally remem∣bered,
that the Apostle Paul, on occasion
of a request which he makes to the Co∣rinthians,
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
uses those remarkable expres∣sions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 1</NOTE>,
<HI>I beseech you by the meekness and
gentleness of Christ.</HI> During all his inter∣course
with men, no harshness, or pride,
or stately distance, appeared in his demea∣nour.
In his access, he was easy; in his
manners, simple: in his answers, mild;
in his whole behaviour, humble and ob∣liging.
<HI>Learn of me,</HI> said he, <HI>for 1 am
meek and lowly in heart.</HI>—As the Son
of God is the pattern, so the Holy Ghost
is the inspirer of gentleness. His name
is <HI>the Comforter,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of grace and
peace.</HI> His <HI>fruits,</HI> or operations on the
human mind, are <HI>love, meekness, gentleness,</HI>
and <HI>long-suffering</HI><NOTE N="dagger" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22</NOTE>.—Thus, by every
discovery of the Godhead, honour is put
upon gentleness: It is held up to our
view, as peculiarly connected with Ce∣lestial
Nature. And suitable to such dis∣coveries,
is the whole strain of the Gospel.
It were unnecessary to appeal to any single
precept. You need only open the New
Testament, to find this virtue perpetually
inculcated. Charity, or love, is the ca∣pital
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
figure ever presented to our view;
and gentleness, forbearance, and forgive∣ness,
are the sounds ever recurring on
our ear.</P>
<P>So predominant, indeed, is this spirit
throughout the Christian dispensation,
that even the vices and corruptions of
men have not been able altogether to
defeat its tendency. Though that dis∣pensation
is far from having hitherto
produced its full effect upon the world,
yet we can clearly trace its influence, in
humanizing the manners of men. Re∣markable,
in this respect, is the victory
which it has gained over those powers of
violence and cruelty, which belong to the
infernal kingdom. Wherever Christia∣nity
prevails, it has discouraged, and, in
some degree, abolished slavery. It has
rescued human nature from that ignomi∣nious
yoke, under which, in former ages,
the one half of mankind groaned. It has
introduced more equality between the two
sexes, and rendered the conjugal union
more rational and happy. It has abated
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
the ferociousness of war. It has miti∣gated
the rigour of despotism, mitigated
the cruelty of punishments; in a word, it
has reduced mankind, from their ancient
barbarity, into a more humane and gentle
slate.—Do we pretend respect and zeal
for this religion, and at the same time al∣low
ourselves in that harshness and seve∣rity,
which are so contradictory to its ge∣nius?
Too plainly we show, that it has
no power over our hearts. We may re∣tain
the Christian name; but we have
abandoned the Christian spirit.
II. Consider the relation which you
bear to one another. Man, as a solitary
individual, is a very wretched being. As
long as he stands detached from his kind,
he is possessed, neither of happiness, nor
of strength. We are formed by Nature
to unite; we are impelled towards each
other, by the compassionate instincts in
our frame; we are linked by a thousand
connections, founded on common wants.
Gentleness, therefore, or, as it is very pro∣perly
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
termed, humanity, is what man, as
such, in every station, owes to man. To be
inaccessible, contemptuous, and hard of
heart, is to revolt against our own nature;
is, in the language of scripture, to <HI>hide
ourselves from our own flesh.</HI> Accordingly,
as all feel the claim which they have to
mildness and humanity, so all are sen∣sibly
hurt by the want of it in others.
On no side are we more vulnerable. No
complaint is more feelingly made, than
that of the harsh and rugged manners
of persons with whom we have inter∣course.
But how seldom do we transfer
the case to ourselves, or examine how far
we are guilty of inflicting on others,
whose sensibility is the same with ours,
those very wounds of which we so loudly
complain?</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by
some, that this gentleness, on which we
now insist, regards only those smaller of∣fices
of life, which in their eye are not
essential to religion and goodness. Ne∣gligent,
they confess, of the government
<PB N="157" REF="166"/>
of their temper, or the regulation of their
behaviour, on slight occasions; they are
attentive, as they pretend, to the great
duties of beneficence; and ready, when∣ever
the opportunity presents, to perform
important services to their fellow-crea∣tures.
But let such persons reflect, that
the occasions of performing those import∣ant
good deeds, very rarely occur. Per∣haps
their situation in life, or the nature
of their connections, may in a great mea∣sure
exclude them from such opportuni∣ties.
Great events give scope for great
virtues; but the main tenor of human
life, is composed of small occurrences.
Within the round of these, lie the mate∣rials
of the happiness, of most men; the
subjects of their duty, and the trials of
their virtue. Virtue must be formed and
supported, not by unfrequent acts, but
by daily and repeated exertions. In or∣der
to its becoming either vigorous or
useful, it must be habitually active; not
breaking forth occasionally with a tran∣sient
lustre, like the blaze of the comet;
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
but regular in its returns, like the light
of day: Not like the aromatick gale, which
sometimes feasts the sense; but like the
ordinary breeze, which fans the air, and
renders it healthful.</P>
<P>Years may pass over our heads, with∣out
affording any opportunity for acts
of high beneficence, or extensive utility.
Whereas not a day passes, but, in the
common transactions of life, and espe∣cially
in the intercourse of domestick so∣ciety,
gentleness finds place for promot∣ing
the happiness of others, and strength∣ening
in ourselves the habit of virtue.
Nay, by seasonable discoveries of a hu∣mane
spirit, we sometimes contribute
more materially to the advancement of
happiness, than by actions which are
seemingly more important. There are si∣tuations,
not a few, in human life, where
the encouraging reception, the conde∣scending
behaviour, and the look of sym∣pathy,
bring greater relief to the heart,
than the most liberal supplies of bounty.
While, on the other side, when the hand
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
of liberality is extended to bestow, the want
of gentleness is sufficient to frustrate the
intention of the benefit. We four those
whom we meant to oblige; and, by con∣ferring
favours with ostentation and
harshness, we convert them into injuries.
Can any disposition then be held to pos∣sess
a low place in the scale of virtue,
whole influence is so considerable on the
happiness of the world?</P>
<P>Gentleness is, in truth, the great ave∣nue
to mutual enjoyment. Amidst the
strife of interfering interests, it tempers
the violence of contention, and keeps alive
the seeds of harmony. It softens ani∣mosities;
renews endearments; and ren∣ders
the countenance of man, a refresh∣ment
to man. Banish gentleness from the
earth; suppose the world to be filled with
none but harsh and contentious spirits;
and what sort of society would remain?
The solitude of the desert were prefer∣able
to it. The conflict of jarring ele∣ments
in chaos; the cave, where subterra∣neous
winds contend and roar; the den,
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
where serpents hiss, and beasts of the
forrest howl; would be the only proper
representations of such assemblies of men.—<HI>O
that I had wings like a dove! for
then I would fly away, and be at rest. Lo!
then, I would wander far off, and remain
in the winderness: I would hasten my escape
from the windy storm and tempest: For I
have seen violence and strife in the city.
Mischief and sorrow are in the midst of it:
Deceit and guile depart not from the street.</HI>
—Strange! that where men have all
one common interest, they should so of∣ten,
absurdly, concur in defeating it! Has
not Nature already provided a sufficient
quantity of unavoidable evils for the state
of man? As if we did not suffer enough
from the storm which beats upon us with∣out,
must we conspire also, in those socie∣ties
where we assemble, to find a retreat
from that storm, to harass one another?
—But if the sense of duty, and of com∣mon
happiness, be insufficient to recom∣mend
the virtue of which we treat, then
let me desire you,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. Iv. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170"/>
III. To consider your own interest.
Whatever ends a good man can be sup∣posed
to pursue, gentleness will be found
to favour them. It prepossesses and wins
every heart. It persuades, when every
other argument fails; often disarms the
fierce, and melts the stubborn: Where∣as
harshness confirms the opposition it
would subdue; and, of an indifferent
person, creates an enemy. He who could
overlook an injury committed in the col∣lision
of interests, will long and severely
resent the flights of a contemptuous be∣haviour.
—To the man of gentleness,
the world is generally disposed to ascribe
every other good quality. The higher
endowments of the mind we admire at
a distance; and when any impropriety of
behaviour accompanies them, we admire
without love. They are like some of the
distant stars, whose beneficial influence
reaches not to us. Whereas, of the in∣fluence
of gentleness, all in some degree
partake, and therefore all love it. The
man of this character, rises in the world
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
without struggle, and flourishes without
envy. His misfortunes are universally
lamented; and his failings are easily for∣given.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the effect of this
virtue on our external condition, its in∣fluence
on our internal enjoyment is cer∣tain
and powerful. That inward tran∣quillity
which it promotes, is the first re∣quisite
to every pleasurable feeling. It
is the calm and clear atmosphere, the se∣renity
and sun-shine of the mind. When
benignity and gentleness reign within,
we are always least in hazard of being
ruffled from without; every person, and
every occurrence, are beheld in the most
favourable light. But let some clouds
of disgust and ill-humour gather on
the mind; and immediately the scene
changes; Nature seems transformed; and
the appearance of all things is blackened
to our view. The gentle mind is like the
smooth stream, which reflects every ob∣ject
in its just proportion, and in its fairest
colours. The violent spirit, like troubled
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
waters, renders back the images of things
distorted and broken; and communicates
to them all, that disordered motion which
arises solely from its own agitation.</P>
<P><HI>Offences must come.</HI> As soon may the
waves of the sea cease to roll, as provo∣cations
to arise from human corruption
and frailty. Attacked by great injuries,
the man of mild and gentle spirit will
feel what human nature feels; and will
defend and resent, as his duty allows him.
But to those slight provocations, and fri∣volous
offences, which are the most fre∣quent
causes of disquiet, he is happily
superiour. Hence his days flow in a far
more placid tenor than those of others;
exempted from the numberless discompo∣sures
which agitate vulgar minds. In∣spired
with higher sentiments; taught to
regard, with indulgent eye, the frailties of
men, the omissions of the careless, the fol∣lies
of the imprudent, and the levity of
the fickle, he retreats into the calmness of
his spirit, as into an undisturbed sanctu∣ary;
and quietly allows the usual current
of life to hold its course.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="173"/>
This virtue has another, and still more
important connection with our interest,
by means of that relation which our pre∣sent
behaviour bears to our eternal state.
Heaven is the region of gentleness and
friendship; hell, of fierceness and animo∣sity.
If then, as the scripture instructs us,
<HI>according to what we now sow, we must
hereafter reap;</HI> it follows, that the cultiva∣tion
of a gentle temper is necessary to pre∣pare
us for future felicity; and that the
indulgence of harsh dispositions, is the
introduction to future misery. Men, 1
am afraid, too often separate those articles
of their belief which relate to eternity,
from the ordinary affairs of the world.
They connect them with the seasons of
seriousness and gravity. They leave them,
with much respect, as in a high region,
to which, only on great occasions, they
resort; and, when they descend into com∣mon
life, consider themselves as at liberty
to give free scope to their humours and
passions. Whereas, in fact, it is their be∣haviour
in the daily train of social inter∣course,
<PB N="165" REF="174"/>
which, more than any other cause,
fixes and determines their spiritual cha∣racter;
gradually instilling those disposi∣tions,
and forming; those habits, which
affect their everlasting condition. With
regard to trifles, perhaps, their malig∣nant
dispositions may chiefly be indulged.
But let them remember well, that those
trifles, by increasing the growth of pee∣vishness
and passion, become pregnant
with the most serious mischiefs; and may
fit them, before they are aware, for being
the future companions of infernal spirits
only.</P>
<P>I mean not to say, that in order to our
preparation for Heaven, it is enough to
be mild and gentle; or that this virtue
alone, will cover all our sins. Through the
felicity of natural constitution, a certain
degree of this benignity may be possessed
by some, whose hearts are in other re∣spects
corrupt, and their lives irregular.
But what I mean to assert, is, that where
no attention is given to the government
of temper, meetness for Heaven is not
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
yet acquired, and the regenerating power
of religion is as yet unknown. One of
the first works of the Spirit of God, is, to
infuse into every heart which it inhabits,
that <HI>gentle wisdom which is from above.
They who are Christ's, have crucified the
slesh with its affections and lusts;</HI> but let
it not be forgotten, that among the <HI>works
of the flesh, hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, strise, and envyings,</HI> are as expressly
enumerated, as <HI>uncleanness, murders, drunk∣enness,</HI>
and <HI>revelling</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cal. v. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> They who conti∣nue
either in the one or the other, <HI>shall
not inherit,</HI> indeed can not inherit, <HI>the
kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus shown the importance of
gentleness, both as a moral virtue, and
as a Christian grace, I shall conclude the
subjcct, with briefly suggesting some con∣siderations
which may be of use to faci∣litate
the practice of it.</P>
<P>For this end, let me advise you to view
your character with an impartial eye;
and to learn, from your own failings, to
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
give that indulgence which in your turn
you must claim. It is pride which fills
the world with so much harshness and
severity. In the fulness of self-estimation,
we forget what we are. We claim atten∣tions,
to which we are not entitled. We
are rigorous to offences, as if we had ne∣ver
offended; unfeeling to distress, as if
we knew not what it was to suffer. From
those airy regions of pride and folly, let
us descend to our proper level. Let us
survey the natural equality on which
Providence has placed man with man,
and reflect on the infirmities common to
all. If the reflection on natural equa∣lity
and mutual offences be insufficient to
prompt humanity, let us at least remem∣ber
what we are in the sight of God.
Have we none of that forbearance to give
to one another, which we all so earnestly
intreat from Heaven? Can we look for
clemency or gentleness from our Judge,
when we are so backward to show it to
our own brethren?
<PB N="168" REF="177"/>
Accustom yourselves, also, to reflect on
the small moment of those things which
are the usual incentives to violence and
contention. In the ruffled and angry
hour, we view every appearance through
a false medium. The most inconsiderable
point of interest, or honour, swells into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
momentous object; and the slightest at∣tack
seems to threaten immediate ruin.
But after passion or pride has subsided, we
look round in vain for the mighty mis∣chiefs
we dreaded. The fabrick, which
our disturbed imagination had reared, to∣tally
disappears. But though the cause of
contention has dwindled away, its con∣sequences
remain. We have alienated a
friend; we have embittered an enemy;
we have sown the seeds of future suspicion,
malevolence, or disgust.—Suspend your
violence, I beseech you, for a moment,
when causes of discord occur. Antici∣pate
that period of coolness, which, of it∣self,
will soon arrive. Allow yourselve
to reflect, how little you have any pro∣spect
of gaining by fierce contention; but
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
how much of the true happiness of life
you are certain of throwing away. Easi∣ly,
and from the smallest chink, the bit∣ter
waters of strife are let forth; but with
difficulty is their course restrained; and
when once they begin to flow, they never
fail to poison his cup who was the first to
give them passage.</P>
<P>But gentleness will, most of all, be pro∣moted
by frequent views of those great
objects which our holy religion presents.
Let the prospects of immortality fill your
minds. Look upon this world as a state of
passage. Consider yourselves as engaged in
the pursuit of higher interests; as acting
now, under the eye of God, an intro∣ductory
part to a more important scene.
Elevated by such sentiments, your minds
will become calm and sedate. You will
look down, as from a superiour station,
on the petty disturbances of the world.
They are the selfish, the sensual, and the
vain, who are most subject to the impo∣tence
of passion. They are linked so
closely to the world; by so many sides
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
they touch every object, and every per∣son
around them, that they are perpetu∣ally
hurt, and perpetually hurting others.
But the spirit of true religion removes
us to a proper distance from the grating
objects of worldly contention. It leaves
us sufficiently connected with the world,
for acting our part in it with propriety;
but disengages us from it so far, as to
weaken its power of disturbing our tran∣quillity.
It inspires magnanimity; and
magnanimity always breathes gentleness.
It leads us to view the follies of men with
pity, not with rancour; and to treat, with
the mildness of a superiour nature, what
in little minds would call forth all the
bitterness of passion.</P>
<P>Aided by such considerations, let us
cultivate that gentle wisdom which is,
in so many respects, important both to
our duty and our happiness. Let us as∣sume
it as the ornament of every age, and
of every station. Let it temper the petu∣lance
of youth, and soften the morose∣ness
of old age. Let it mitigate autho∣rity
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
in those who rule, and promote de∣ference
among those who obey. I con∣clude
with repeating the caution, not to
mistake for true gentleness, that flimzy
imitation of it, called polished manners,
which often, among the men of the
world, under a smooth appearance con∣ceals
much asperity. Let yours be na∣tive
gentleness of heart, flowing from the
love of God, and the love of man. Unite
this amiable spirit, with a proper zeal for
all that is right, and just, and true. Let
piety be combined in your character
with humanity: Let determined integri∣ty
dwell in a mild and gentle breast. A
character thus supported, will command
more real respect, than can be procured
by the most shining accomplishments,
when separated from virtue.</P>

King's gate.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE> who,
though high in station and power,
confessed himself to be miserable. They
relate to a memorable occurrence in the
Persian history, under the reign of Aha∣suerus,
who is supposed to be the Prince
known among Greek historians by the
name of Artaxerxes. Ahasuerus had ad∣vanced
to the chief dignity in his king∣dom
Haman an Amalekite, who inhe∣rited
all the ancient enmity of his race to
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
the Jewish nation. He appears, from
what is recorded of him, to have been a
very wicked minister. Raised to greatness
without merit, he employed his power
solely for the gratification of his passions.
As the honours which he possessed were
next to royal, his pride was every day fed
with that servile homage which is pecu∣liar
to Afiatick courts; and all the ser∣vants
of the King prostrated thcmselves
before him. In the midst of this general
adulation, one person only stooped not to
Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew;
who, knowing this Amalekite to be an
enemy to the people of God, and, with
virtuous indignation, despising that info∣lence
of prosperity with which he saw
him lifted up, <HI>bowed not, nor did him re∣verence.</HI>
On this appearance of disre∣spect
from Mordecai, Haman <HI>was full</HI> of
wrath: But he thought scorn to lay hands
on Mordecai alone. Personal revenge was
not sufficient to satisfy him. So violent
and black were his passions, that he re∣solved
to exterminate the whole nation to
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
which Mordecai belonged. Abusing, for
this cruel purpose, the favour of his cre∣dulous
Sovereign, he obtained a decree to
be sent forth, that, against a certain day,
all the Jews throughout the Persian domi∣nions
should be put to the sword. Mean
while, confident of success, and blind to
approaching ruin, he continued to exult
in his prosperity. Invited by Ahasuerus
to a royal banquet, which Esther the
Queen had prepared, <HI>he went forth that
day joyful, and with a glad heart.</HI> But be∣hold
how slight an incident was suffi∣cient
to poison his joy! As he went forth,
he saw Mordecai in the King's gate; and
observed, that still he refused to do him
homage: <HI>He stood not up, nor was moved
for him;</HI> although he well knew the for∣midable
designs which Haman was pre∣paring
to execute. One private man, who
despised his greatness, and disdained sub∣mission,
while a whole kingdom trembled
before him; one spirit, which the utmost
stretch of his power could neither subdue
nor humble, blasted his triumphs. His
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
whole soul was shaken with a storm of
passion. Wrath, pride, and desire of re∣venge,
rose into fury. With difficulty he
restrained himself in publick; but as soon
as he came to his own house, he was
forced to disclose the agony of his mind.
He gathered together his friends and fa∣mily,
with Zeresh his wife. <HI>He told them
of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
of his children, and all the things wherein
the King had promoted him, and how he had
advanced him above the princes and ser∣vants
of the King. He said, moreover, Yea
Esther the Queen did let no man come in
with the King, unto the banquet that she
had prepared, but myself; and to-morrow
also am I invited unto her with the King.</HI>
After all this preamble, what is the conclusion?—Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the few fitting at the King's gate.</P>
<P>The sequel of Haman's history I shall
not now pursuce. It might afford matter
for much instruction, by the conspicuous
justice of God in his fall and punishment.
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
But, contemplating only the singular situ∣ation
in which the Text presents him, and
the violent agitation of his mind which
it displays, the following reflections na∣turally
arise, which, together with some
practical improvements, shall make the
subject of this discourse. I. How miser∣able
is vice, when one guilty passion cre∣ates
so much torment! II. How unavail∣ing
is prosperity, when, in the height of
it, a single disappointment can destroy the
relish of all its pleasures! III. How weak
is human nature, which, in the absence
of real, is thus prone to form to itself
imaginary woes!</P>
<P>I. How miserable is vice, when one
guilty passion is capable of creating so
much torment! When we discourse to
you of the internal misery of sinners;
whcn we represent the pangs which they
suffer from violent passions, and a corrupt∣ed
heart; we are sometimes suspected of
chusing a theme for declamation, and of
heightening the picture which we draw,
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
by colours borrowed from fancy. They
whose minds are, by nature, happily tran∣quil,
or whose situation in life removes
them from the disturbance and tumuls of
passion, can hardly conceive, that, as long
as the body is at ease, and the external con∣dition
prosperous, any thing which passes
within the mind should cause such exquisite
woe. But, for the truth of our assertions,
we appeal to the history of mankind. We
might reason from the constitution of the
rational frame; where the understanding
is appointed to be supreme, and the pas∣sions
to be subordinate; and where, if
this due arrangement of its parts be over∣thrown,
misery as necessarily ensues, as
pain is consequent in the animal frame,
upon the distortion of its members. But
laying speculations of this kind aside, it
is sufficient to lead you to the view of
facts, the import of which can neither
be controverted, nor mistaken. This is,
indeed, the great advantage of history,
that it is a mirrour which holds up man∣kind
to their own view. For, in all ages,
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
human nature has been the same. In the
circle of worldly affairs, the same charac∣ters
and situations are perpetually return∣ing;
and in the follies and passions, the
vices and crimes, of the generations that
are past, we read those of the present.</P>
<P>Attend, then, to the instance now be∣fore
us; and conceive, if you can, a per∣son
more thoroughly wretched, than one
reduced to make this humiliating confes∣sion,
that, though surrounded with power,
opulence and pleasure, he was lost to all
happiness, through the fierceness of his re∣sentment;
and was at that moment stung
by disappointment, and torn by rage, be∣yond
what he could bear. <HI>All this avail∣eth</HI>
me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the
few sitting at the King's gate. Had this
been a soliloquy of Haman's with himself,
it would have been a sufficient discovery
of his misery. But when we consider it
as a confession which he makes to others,
it is a proof that his misery was be∣come
insupportable. For such agitations
of the mind, every man strives to con∣ceal,
<PB N="179" REF="188"/>
because he knows they dishonour
him. Other griefs and sorrows, he can,
with freedom, pour out to a confident.
What he suffers from the injustice or ma∣lice
of the world, he is not ashamed to
acknowledge. But when his suffering
arises from the bad dispositions of his own
heart; when, in the height of prosperity,
he is rendered miserable, solely by disap∣pointed
pride, every ordinary motive for
communication ceases. Nothing but the
violence of anguish, can drive him to con∣fess
a passion which renders him odious,
and a weakness which renders him des∣picable.
To what extremity, in parti∣cular,
must he be reduced, before he can
disclose to his own family the infamous
secret of his misery? In the eye of his
family every man wishes to appear re∣spectable,
and to cover from their know∣ledge
whatever may vilify or degrade
him. Attacked or reproached abroad, he
consoles himself with his importance at
home; and in domestick attachment and
respect, seeks for some compensation for
<PB N="180" REF="189"/>
the injustice of the world.—Judge, then,
of the degree of torment which Haman
endured, by its breaking through all these
restraints, and forcing him to publish his
shame before those, from whom all men
seek most to hide it. How severe must
have been the conflict which he under∣went
within himself, before he called to∣gether
his wife and all his friends for
this purpose? How dreadful the agony
he suffered at the moment of his confession,
when, to the astonished company,
he laid open the cause of his distress?</P>
<P>Assemble all the evils which poverty,
disease, or violence can inflict, and their
stings will be found by far less pungent,
than those which such guilty passions
dart into the heart. Amidst the ordi∣nary
calamities of the world, the mind
can exert its powers, and suggest relief:
And the mind is properly the man; the
sufferer, and his sufferings, can be distin∣guished.
But those disorders of passion,
by seizing directly on the mind, attack
human nature in its strong hold, and
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
cut off its last resource. They penetrate
to the very seat of sensation; and convert
all the powers of thought into instru∣ments
of torture.</P>
<P>Let us remark, in the event that is now
before us, the awful hand of God; and
admire his justice, in thus making the
sinner's <HI>own wickedness to reprove him, and
his backslidings to correct him.</HI> Scepticks
reason in vain against the reality of a di∣vine
government. It is not the subject
of dispute. It is a fact which carries the
evidence of sense, and displays itself be∣fore
our eyes. We see the Almighty ma∣nifestly
<HI>pursuing the sinner with evil.</HI> We
see him connecting with every signal de∣viation
from duty, those wounds of the
spirit which occasion the most exquisite
torment. He hath not merely promul∣gated
his laws now, and delayed the dis∣tribution
of rewards and punishments,
until a future period of being. But the
sanctions of his laws already take place;
their effects appear; and with such infi∣nite
wisdom are they contrived, as to
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
require no other executioners of justice
against the sinner, than his own guilty
passions. God needs not come forth from
his secret place, in order to bring him to
punishment. He needs not call thunder
down from the heavens, nor raise any
minister of wrath from the abyss below.
He need only say, <HI>Ephraim is joined to his
idols; let him alone:</HI> And, at that instant,
the sinner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of itself, to kindle
within him. The worm that never dies,
seizes on his heart.</P>
<P>Let us remark also, from this example,
how imperfectly we can judge from ex∣ternal
appearances, concerning real hap∣piness
or misery. All Persia, it is pro∣bable,
envied Haman as the happiest per∣son
in the empire; while yet, at the mo∣ment
when we now consider him, there
was not within its bounds, one more
thoroughly wretched. We are seduced
and deceived, by that false glare which
prosperity sometimes throws around bad
men. We are tempted to imitate their
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
crimes, in order to partake of their ima∣gined
felicity. But remember Haman,
and beware of the snare. Think not,
when you behold a pageant of grandeur
displayed to publick view, that you dis∣cern
the ensign of certain happiness. In
order to form any just conclusion, you
must follow the great man into the re∣tired
apartment, where he lays aside his
disguise. You must not only be able to
penetrate into the interior of families,
but you must have a faculty by which
you can look into the inside of hearts.
Were you endowed with such a power,
you would most commonly behold good
men, in proportion to their goodness,
satisfied and easy; you would behold
atrocious sinners, always restless and un∣happy.</P>
<P>Unjust are our complaints, of the pro∣miscuous
distribution made by Provi∣dence
of its favours among men. From
superficial views such complaints arise.
The distribution of the goods of fortune,
indeed, may often be pron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cuous; that
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
is, disproportioned to the moral charac∣ters
of men; but the allotment of real
happiness is never so. For <HI>to the wicked
there is no peace. They are like the troubled
sea when it cannot rest. They travel with
pain all their days. Trouble and anguish
prevail against them. Terrours make them
afraid on every side. A dreadful sound is
in their ears; and they are in great fear
where no fear is.</HI>—Hitherto we have
considered Haman under the character of
a very wicked man, tormented by crimi∣nal
passions. Let us now consider him,
merely as a child of fortune, a prosper∣ous
man of the world; and proceed to
observe,</P>
<P>II. How unavailing worldly prosperity
is, since, in the midst of it, a single dis∣appointment
is sufficient to embitter all
its pleasures. We might at first imagine,
that the natural effect of prosperity would
be, to diffuse over the mind a prevailing
satisfaction, which the lesser evils of life
could not ruffle or disturb. We might
<PB N="185" REF="194"/>
expect, that as one in the full glow of
health, despises the inclemency of wea∣ther;
so one in possession of all the advan∣tages
of high power and station, should
disregard slight injuries; and, at perfect
ease within himself, should view, in the
most favourable light, the behaviour of
others around him. Such effects would
indeed follow, if worldly prosperity con∣tained
in itself the true principles of hu∣man
felicity. But as it possesses them
not, the very reverse of those consequen∣ces
generally obtains. Prosperity debili∣tates,
instead of strengthening the mind.
Its most common effect is, to create an
extreme sensibility to the slightest wound.
It foments impatient desires; and raises
expectations which no success can satisfy.
It fosters a false delicacy, which sickens
in the midst of indulgence. By repeat∣ed
gratification, it blunts the feelings of
men to what is pleasing; and leaves them
unhappily acute to whatever is uneasy.
Hence, the gale which another would
scarcely feel, is, to the prosperous, a rude
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
tempest. Hence, the rose-leaf doubled
below them on the couch, as is told of
the effeminate Sybarite, breaks their rest.
Hence, the disrespect shown by Mordecai,
preyed with such violence on the heart of
Haman. Upon no principle of reason
can we assign a sufficient cause for all the
distress which this incident occasioned to
him. The cause lay not in the external
incident. It lay within himself; it arose
from a mind distempered by prosperity.</P>
<P>Let this example correct that blind
eagerness, with which we rush to the
chace of worldly greatness and honours.
I say not, that it should altogether divert
us from pursuing them; since, when en∣joyed
with temperance and wisdom, they
may doubtless both enlarge our utility,
and contribute to our comfort. But let it
teach us, not to over-rate them. Let it
convince us, that unless we add to them
the necessary correctives of piety and vir∣tue,
they are, by themselves, more likely
to render us wretched, than to make us
happy.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196"/>
Let the memorable fate of Haman sug∣gest
to us also, how often, besides cor∣rupting
the mind, and engendering in∣ternal
misery, they lead us to precipices,
and involve us in ruin. At the moment
when Fortune seemed to smile upon him,
with the most serene and settled aspect,
she was digging in secret the pit for his
fall; she was weaving around his head
the web of destruction. Success inflam∣ed
his pride; pride inspired him with
insatiable thirst of revenge; the revenge
which, for the sake of one man, he sought
to execute on a whole nation, incensed
the Queen; and he is doomed to suffer
the same death, which he had prepared
for Mordecai.—Had Haman remained
in a private station, he might have ar∣rived
at a peaceable old age. He might
have been, I shall not say, a good or a
happy man, yet probably less guilty by
far, and less wretched, than when placed
at the head of the greatest empire in the
East. <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
in this life, all the days of his vain life,
which he spendeth as a shadow?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="197"/>
An extensive contemplation of human
affairs, will incline us to this conclusion,
that among the different conditions and
ranks of men, the balance of happiness
is preserved in a great measure equal; and
that the high and the low, the rich and
the poor, approach, in point of real enjoy∣ment,
much nearer to each other, than is
commonly imagined. In the lot of man,
mutual compensations, both of pleasure
and of pain, universally take place. Pro∣vidence
never intended, that any state
here should be either completely happy,
or entirely miserable. If the feelings of
pleasure are more numerous, and more
lively, in the higher departments of life,
such also are those of pain. If greatness
flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dan∣gers.
If opulence increases our gratifi∣cations,
it increases, in the same propor∣tion,
our desires and demands. If the
poor are confined to a more narrow cir∣cle,
yet within that circle lie most of
those natural satisfactions, which, after
all the refinements of art, are found to
<PB N="189" REF="198"/>
be the most genuine and true.—In a
state, therefore, where there is neither so
much to be coveted on the one hand, nor
to be dreaded on the other, as at first ap∣pears,
how submissive ought we to be to
the disposal of Providence! how temper∣ate
in our desires and pursuits! how
much more attentive to preserve our vir∣tue,
and to improve our minds, than to
gain the doubtful and equivocal advan∣tages
of worldly prosperity!—But now,
laying aside the consideration of Haman's
great crimes; laying aside his high pro∣sperity;
viewing him simply as a man,
let us observe from his history,</P>
<P>III. How weak human nature is, which,
in the absence of real, is thus prone to
create to itself imaginary woes. <HI>All this
availeth me nothing, so long as I see Morde∣cai
the few sitting at the King's gate.</HI>—
What was it, O Haman! to thee, though
Mordecai had continued to sit there, and
neglected to do thee homage? Would the
banquet have been on that account the
<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
less magnificent, thy palace less splendid,
or thy retinue less numerous? Could the
disrespect of an obscure stranger disho∣nour
the favourite of a mighty King? In
the midst of a thoussand submissive cour∣tiers,
was one sullen countenance an ob∣ject
worthy of drawing thy notice, or of
troubling thy repose?—Alas! in Haman
we behold too just a picture of what of∣ten
passes within ourselves. We never
know what it is to be long at ease. Let
the world cease from changing around us.
Let external things keep that situation in
which we most wish them to remain; yet
somewhat from within shall soon arise, to
disturb our happiness. A <HI>Mordeaci ap∣pears,</HI>
or seems to appear, <HI>sitting at the
gate.</HI> Some vexation, which our fancy
Has either entirely created, or at least has
unreasonably aggravated, corrodes us in
secret; and until that be removed, all
that we enjoy <HI>availeth us nothing.</HI> Thus,
while we are incessantly complaining of
the vanity and the evils of human life,
we make that vanity, and we increase
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
those evils. Unskilled in the art of extract∣ing
happiness from the objects around us,
our ingenuity solely appears in convert∣ing
them into misery.</P>
<P>Nor let it be thought that troubles of
this kind are incident only to the great
and the mighty. Though they, perhaps,
from the intemperance of their passions,
are peculiarly exposed to them, yet the
disease itself belongs to human nature,
and spreads through all ranks. In the
humble, and seemingly quiet shade of
private life, discontent broods over its
imaginary sorrows; preys upon the citi∣zen,
no less than upon the courtier; and
often teems with passions, equally malig∣nant
in the cottage and in the palace.
Having once seized the mind, it tinges
with its own black colour every sur∣rounding
object; it every where searches
out materials for itself; and in no directi∣on
more frequently employs its unhappy
activity, than in creating divisions amongst
mankind, and in magnifying slight pro∣vocations
into mortal injuries. Those self-created
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
created miseries, imaginary in the cause,
but real in the suffering, will be found to
form a proportion of human evils, not
inferiour, either in severity or in number,
to all that we endure from the unavoid∣able
calamities of life. In situations where
much comfort might be enjoyed, this
man's superiority, and that man's ne∣glect,
our jealousy of a friend, our hatred
of a rival, an imagined affront, or a mis∣taken
point of honour, allow us no re∣pose.
Hence, discords in families, ani∣mosities
among friends, and wars among
nations. Hence, Haman miserable in the
midst of all that greatness could bestow.
Hence, multitudes in the most obscure
stations, for whom Providence seemed to
have prepared a quiet life, no less eager
in their petty broils, nor less tormented by
their passions, than if princely honours
were the prize for which they contended.</P>
<P>FROM this train of observation, which
the Text has suggested, can we avoid re∣flecting
upon the disorder in which hu∣man
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
nature plainly appears at present to
lie? We have beheld, in Haman, the pic∣ture
of that misery which arises from evil
passions; of that unhappiness, which is
incident to the highest prosperity; of that
discontent, which is common to every
state. Whether we consider him as a
bad man, a prosperous man, or simply
as a man, in every light we behold rea∣son
too weak for passion. This is the
source of the reigning evil; this is the
root of the universal disease. The story
of Haman only shows us what human
nature has, too generally, appeared to
be, in every age. Hence, when we read
the history of nations, what do we read
but the history of the follies and crimes
of men? We may dignify those recorded
transactions, by calling them the intrigues
of statesmen, and the exploits of conquer∣ors;
but they are, in truth, no other than
the efforts of discontent to escape from its
misery, and the struggles of contending
passions among unhappy men. The hi∣story
of mankind has ever been a conti∣nued
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
tragedy; the world, a great theatre
exhibiting the same repeated scene, of the
follies of men shooting forth into guilt,
and of their passions fermenting, by a
quick process, into misery.</P>
<P>But can we believe, that the nature of
man came forth in this state from the
hands of its gracious Creator? Did he
frame this world, and store it with in∣habitants,
solely that it might be re∣plenished
with crimes and misfortunes?
—In the moral, as well as in the natural
world, we may plainly discern the signs
of some violent convulsion, which has
shattered the original workmanship of the
Almighty. Amidst this wreck of human
nature, traces still remain which indicate
its Author. Those high powers of con∣science
and reason, that capacity for hap∣piness,
that ardour of enterprize, that
glow of affection, which often break
through the gloom of human vanity and
guilt, are like the scattered columns, the
broken arches, and desfaced sculptures of
some fallen temple, whose ancient splen∣dour
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
appears amidst its ruins. So con∣spicuous
in human nature are those cha∣racters,
both of a high origin, and of a de∣graded
state, that, by many religious fects
throughout the earth, they have been seen
and confessed. A tradition seems to have
pervaded almost all nations, that the hu∣man
race had either through some of∣fence
forfeited, or through some misfor∣tune
lost, that station of primaeval honour
which they once possessed. But while,
from this doctrine, ill understood, and in∣volved
in many fabulous tales, the nati∣ons
wandering in Pagan darkness could
draw no consequences that were just;
while, totally ignorant of the nature of
the disease, they sought in vain for the
remedy; the same divine revelation which
has informed us in what manner our apo∣stacy
arose, from the abuse of our rational
powers, has instructed us also how we may
be restored to virtue, and to happiness.</P>
<P>LET us, therefore, study to improve
the assistance which this revelation af∣fords,
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
for the restoration of our nature,
and the recovery of our felicity. With
humble and grateful minds, let us apply
to those medicinal springs which it hath
opened for curing the disorders of our
heart and passions. In this view, let us,
with reverence, look up to that Divine
Personage, who descended into this world
on purpose to be <HI>the light, and the life of
men;</HI> who came, in the fulness of grace
and truth, to <HI>repair the desolations of many
generations,</HI> to restore order among the
works of God, and to raise up a <HI>new
earth, and new heavens, wherein righteous∣ness
should dwell for ever.</HI> Under his
tuition let us put ourselves; and, amidst
the storms of passion to which we are here
exposed, and the slippery paths which we
are left to tread, never trust presumptu∣ously
to our own understanding. Thank∣ful
that a Heavenly Conductor vouchsafes
his aid, let us earnestly pray, that from
him may descend divine light to guide
our steps, and divine strength to fortify
our minds. Let us pray, that his grace
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
may keep us from all intemperate pas∣sions,
and mistaken pursuits of pleasure;
that, whether it shall be his will to give
or to deny us earthly prosperity, he may
bless us with a calm, a sound, and well
regulated mind; may give us modera∣tion
in success, and fortitude under disap∣pointment;
and may enable us so to take
warning from the crimes and miseries of
others, as to escape the snares of guilt.</P>
<P>WHILE we thus maintain a due de∣pendence
on God, let us also exert our∣selves
with care in acting our own part.
From the whole of what has been said,
this great inference arises, that the hap∣piness
of every man depends more upon
the state of his own mind, than upon any
one external circumstancc; nay, more than
upon all external things put together. We
have seen, that inordinate passions are the
great disturbers of life; and that, unless
we possess a good conscience, and a well∣governed
mind, discontent will blast eve∣ry
enjoyment, and the highest prosperity
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
will prove only disguised misery. Fix
then this conclusion in your minds, that
the destruction of your virtue, is the de∣struction
of your peace. <HI>Keep thy heart
with all diligence;</HI> govern it with the
greatest care; <HI>for out of it are the issues
of life.</HI> In no station, in no period, think
yourselves secure from the dangers which
spring from your passions. Every age,
and every station, they beset; from youth
to grey hairs, and from the peasant to
the prince.</P>
<P>At your first setting out in life, espe∣cially,
when yet unacquainted with the
world and its shares, when every pleasure
enchants with its smile, and every object
shines with the gloss of novelty; beware
of the seducing appearances which sur∣round
you, and recollect what others
have suffered from the power of head∣strong
desire. If you allow any passion,
even though ranked among those which
are innocent, to acquire an absolute as∣cendant,
your inward peace will be im∣paired.
But if any, which have the taint
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
of guilt, take early possession of your
mind, you may date from that moment
the ruin of your tranquillity. Nor with
the season of youth does the peril end.
To the impetuosity of youthful desire,
succeed the more sober, but no less dan∣gerous,
attachments of advancing years;
when the passions which are connected
with interest end ambition, begin their
reign, and too frequently extend their
malignant influence, even over those pe∣riods
of life which ought to be most tran∣quil.
From the first to the last of man's
abode on earth, the discipline must never
be relaxed, of guarding the heart from the
dominion of passion. Eager passions, and
violent desires, were not made for man.
They exceed his sphere. They find no
adequate objects on earth; and of course
can be productive of nothing but misery.
The certain consequence of indulging
them is, that there shall come an evil
day, when the anguish of disappoint∣ment
shall drive us to acknowledge, that
all which we <HI>enjoy availeth us nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209"/>
You are not to imagine, that the warn∣ings
which I have given in this discourse,
are applicable only to the case of such
signal offenders as he was, of whom the
Text treats. Think not, as I am afraid
too many do, that, because your passi∣ons
have not hurried you into atrocious
deeds, they have therefore wrought no
mischief, and have left no sting behind
them. By a continued series of loose,
though apparently trivial, gratifications,
the heart is often as thoroughly corrupt∣ed,
as by the commission of any one of
those enormous crimes which spring from
great ambition, or great revenge. Habit
gives the passions strength, while the ab∣sence
of glaring guilt seemingly justifies
them; and, unawakened by remorse, the
sinner proceeds in his course, till he wax
bold in guilt, and become ripe for ruin.
For, by gradual and latent steps, the de∣struction
of our virtue advances. Did
the evil unvail itself at the beginning:
Did the storm which is to overthrow our
peace, discover, as it rose, all its horrours,
<PB N="201" REF="210"/>
precautions would more frequently be
takcn against it. But we are impercep∣tibly
betrayed; and from one licentious
attachment, one criminal passion, are,
by a train of consequences, drawn on
to another, till the government of our
minds is irrecoverably lost. The enti∣cing
and the odious passions are, in this
respect, similar in their process; and,
though by different roads, conduct at
last to the same issue. David, when he
first beheld Bathsheba, did not plan the
death of Uriah. Haman was not deli∣vered
up all at once to the madness of
revenge. His passions rose with, the ris∣ing
tide of prosperity; and pride com∣pleated
what prosperity began. What
was originally no more than displeasure
at Mordecai's disrespect, increased with
every invitation he received to the ban∣quet
of the King; till it impelled him to
devise the slaughter of a whole nation,
and ended in a degree of rage, which
confounded his reason, and hurried him
to ruin. In this manner, every crimi∣nal
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
passion, in its progress, swells and
blackens; and what was at first a small
cloud, such as the Prophet's servant saw,
<HI>no bigger</HI> than a man's hand, rising from the
sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xviii. 44.</NOTE>, is soon found to carry the tempest
in its womb.</P>

In many instances we clearly per∣ceive,
that either more or less would have
proved detrimental to his state; that en∣tire
ignorance would have deprived him
of proper motives to action; and that
complete discovery would have raised
him to a sphere too high for his pre∣sent

most to his improvement; which
affords him knowledge sufficient for the
purposes of virtue, and of active life,
without disturbing the operations of his

This evidently holds, with respect
to that degree of concealment which now

of our own life, and the thoughts and

<P>But there is an ignorance of another
kind, with respect to which the applica∣tion
of this remark may appear more du∣bious;
the ignorance under which men
labour concerning their happiness in the

like the <HI>shadow.</HI> For, to what purpose
are all his labours in the pursuit of an

discover or ascertain?—Let us then seri∣ously
enquire, what account can be given
of our present ignorance, respecting what
is good for us in this life; whether no∣thing
be left, but only to wander in
uncertainty amidst this darkness, and to
lament it as the sad consequence of our
fallen state; or whether such instructi∣ons
may not be derived from it, as give
ground for acknowledging, that by this,
as by all its other appointments, the wis∣dom
of Providence brings real good out
of seeming evil. I shall, in order to de∣termine
this point, first, endeavour to illu∣strate
the doctrine of the Text, that we know
<PB N="206" REF="215"/>
not, or at most know imperfectly, <HI>what
is good for us in this life:</HI> I shall next
explain the causes to which this defect
in our knowledge is owing: And then,
shall show the purposes which it was in∣tended
to serve, and the effects which it
ought to produce on our conduct.</P>
<P>THE whole history of mankind seems
a comment on the doctrine of the Text.
When we review the course of human
affairs, one of the first objects which eve∣ry
where attracts our notice is, the mis∣taken
judgment of men concerning their
own interest. That <HI>sore evil,</HI> which So∣lomon
long ago remarked with respect to
riches, of their being <HI>kept by the owners
thereof to their hurt,</HI> takes place equally
with respect to dominion and power, and
all the splendid objects and high stati∣ons
of life. We every day behold men
climbing, by painful steps, to that co∣veted
height, which, in the end, renders
their fall more severe, and their ruin
more conspicuous. But it is not to high
<PB N="207" REF="216"/>
stations that the doctrine of the Text is
limited. In the crimes by which too of∣ten
these are gained, and in the misfor∣tunes
which they afterwards bring forth,
the greater part of every audience may
think themselves little concerned. Leav∣ing
such themes, therefore, to the poet
and the historian, let us come nearer to
ourselves, and survey the ordinary walk
of life.</P>
<P>Around us, we every where behold a
busy multitude. Restless and uneasy in
their present situation, they are incessant∣ly
employed in accomplishing a change
of it; and, as soon as their wish is ful∣filled,
we discern, by their behaviour, that
they are as dissatisfied as they were be∣fore.
Where they expected to have found
a paradise, they find a desert. The man
of business pines for leisure. The leisure
for which he had longed, proves an irk∣some
gloom; and, through want of em∣ployment,
he languishies, sickens, and dies.
The man of retirement fancies no state to
be so happy, as that of active life. But
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
he has not engaged long in the tumults
and contests of the world, until he finds
cause to look back with regret on the calm
hours of his former privacy and retreat,
Beauty, wit, eloquence, and fame, are
eagerly coveted by men in every rank of
life. They are the parent's fondest wish for
his child; the ambition of the young, and
the admiration of the old. And yet, in what
numberless instances have they proved,
to those who possessed them, no other than
shining snares; seductions to vice, insti∣gations
to folly, and, in the end, sources
of misery? Comfortably might their days.
have passed, had they been less conspicu∣ous.
But the distinctions which brought
them forth to noticc, conferred splendour,
and withdrew happiness. Long life is,
of all others, the most general, and seem∣ingly
the most innocent, object of desire.
With respect to this too, we so frequently
err, that it would have been a blessing
to many to have had their wish denied.
There was a period, when they might
have quitted the stage with honour, and
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
in peace. But by living too long, they
outlived their reputation; outlived their
family, their friends, and comforts; and
reaped nothing from the continuance of
days, except to feel the pressure of age,
to taste the dregs of life, and to behold a
wider compass of human misery.</P>
<P><HI>Man walketh in a vain shew.</HI> His fears
are often as vain as his wishes. As what
flattered him in expectation, frequently
wounds him in possession; so the event
to which he looked forward with an
anxious and fearful eye, has often, when
it arrived, laid its terrours aside; nay,
has brought in its train unexpected bles∣sings.
Both good and evil are beheld at
a distance, through a perspective which
deceives. The colours of objects when
nigh, are entirely different from what they
appeared when viewed in futurity.</P>
<P>THE fact then being undoubtedly cer∣tain,
that it is common for men to be
deceived in their prospects of happiness,
let us next enquire into the causes of that
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
deception. Let us attend to those peculiar
circumstances in our state, which render
us such incompetent judges of future good
or evil in this life.</P>
<P>First, We are not sufficiently acquainted
with ourselves, to for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>see our future feel∣ings.
We judge by the sensations of the
present moment; and, in the fervour of
desire, pronounce confidently concerning
the desired object. But we reflect not,
that our minds, like our bodies, undergo
great alteration from the situations into
which they are thrown, and the progres∣sive
stages of life through which they
pass. Hence, concerning any condition
which is yet untried, we conjecture with
much uncertainty. In imagination, we
carry our present wants, inclinations, and
sentiments, into the state of life to which
we aspire. But no sooner have we entered
on it, than our sentiments and inclina∣tions
change. New wants and desires
arise; new objects are required to gratify
them; and by consequence our old dis∣satisfaction
returns; and the void, which
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
was to have been filled, remains as great
as it was before.</P>
<P>But, next, supposing our knowledge of
ourselves sufficient to direct us in the
choice of happiness, yet still we are liable
to err, from our ignorance of the con∣nections
which subsist between our own
condition and that of others. No indi∣vidual
can be happy, unless the circum∣stances
of those around him be so adjusted
as to conspire with his interest. For, in
human society, no happiness or misery
stands unconnected, and independent.
Our fortunes are interwoven by threads
innumerable. We touch one another on
all sides. One man's misfortune or suc∣cess,
his wisdom or his folly, often, by its
consequences, reaches through multitudes.
Such a system is far too complicated for
our arrangement. It requires adjustments
beyond our skill and power. It is a chaos
of events, into which our eye cannot pierce;
and is capable of regulation, only by him
who perceives at one glance the relation
of each to all.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="221"/>
Farther, As we are ignorant of the
events which will arise from the combi∣nation
of our circumstances with those of
others, so we are equally ignorant of the
influence which the present incidents of
our life may have upon those which are
future. The important question is not,
What is good for a man one day; but
what is <HI>good for him all the days of his
life?</HI> Not, what will yield him a few scat∣tered
pleasures; but what will render his
life happy on the whole amount? And is he
able to answer that question, who knoweth
not what <HI>one day may bring forth;</HI> who
cannot tell, whether the events of it may
not branch out into consequences, which
shall assume a direction quite opposite to
that in which they set forth, and shall
spread themselves over all his life to come?
There is not any present moment that is
unconnected with some future one. The
life of every man is a continued chain of
incidents, each link of which hangs upon
the former. The transition from cause to
effect, from event to event, is often car∣ried
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
on by secret steps, which our fore∣sight
cannot divine, and our sagacity is
unable to trace. Evil may, at some fu∣ture
period, bring forth good; and good
may bring forth evil, both equally unex∣pected.
Had the Patriarch, Joseph, con∣tinued
to loiter under his father's fond
indulgence, he might have lived an ob∣scure
and insignificant life. From the pit
and the prison, arose the incidents which
made him the ruler of Egypt, and the sa∣viour
of his father's house.</P>
<P>Lastiy, Supposing every other incapa∣city
to be removed, our ignorance of the
dangers to which our spiritual state is
exposed, would disqualify us for judging
foundly concerning our true happiness.
Higher interests, than those of the present
world, are now depending. All that is
done or suffered by us here, ultimately
refers to that immortal world, for which
good men are trained up, under the care
of an Almighty Parent. We are as in∣competent
judges of the measures ne∣cessary
to be pursued for this end, as
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
children are, of the proper conduct to be
held in their education. We foresee the
dangers of our spiritual, still less than
we do those of our natural state; because
we are less attentive to trace them. We
are still more exposed to vice than to mi∣sery;
because the confidence which we
place in our virtue, is yet worse founded
than that which we place in our wisdom.
Can you esteem him prosperous, who is
raised to a situation which flatters his pas∣sions,
but which corrupts his principles,
disorders his temper, and, finally, oversets
his virtue? In the ardour of pursuit, how
little are these effects foreseen? And yet,
how often are they accomplished, by a
change of condition? Latent corruptions
are called forth; seeds of guilt are quick∣ened
into life; a growth of crimes arises,
which, had it not been for the fatal cul∣ture
of prosperity, would never have seen
the light. How often is man, boastful as
he is of reason, merely the creature of his
fortune; formed, and moulded, by the in∣cidents
of his life!—Hazael, when yet
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
a, private man, detested the thoughts of
cruelty. <HI>Thou shalt slay the young men
with the sword,</HI> said the Prophet: <HI>Thou
shalt dash the children, and rip up the wo∣men
with child. It thy servant a dog,</HI> repli∣ed
Hazael, <HI>that he should do these things?</HI>
But no sooner was he cloathed with the
coveted purple, than it seemed to taint
his nature. He committed the crimes of
which, at a distance, he believed himself
incapable; and became the bloody ty∣rant,
whose character his soul once ab∣horred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings viii. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH then at present is man; thus in∣capable
of pronouncing with certainty
concerning his own good or evil. Of
futurity he discerns little; and even that
little he sees through a cloud. Ignorant
of the alteration which his sentiments
and desires will undergo from new situ∣ations
in life; ignorant of the conse∣quences
which will follow from the com∣bination
of his circumstances with those
of others around him; ignorant of the
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
influence which the present may have on
the future events of his life; ignorant
of the effect which a change of condition
may produce on his moral character, and
his eternal interests; How can he know
<HI>what is good for him all the days of his
vain life, which be spendeth as a shadow?</HI></P>
<P>Instead of only lamenting this igno∣rance,
let us, in the last place, consider how
it ought to be improved; what duties it
suggests, and what wise ends it was in∣tended
by Providence to promote.</P>
<P>I. LET this doctrine teach us to pro∣ceed
with caution and circumspection,
through a world, where evil so frequent∣ly
lurks under the form of good. To be
humble and modest in opinion, to be vi∣gilant
and attentive in conduct, to dis∣trust
fair appearances, and to restrain rash
desires, are instructions which the dark∣ness
of our present state should strongly
inculcate. God hath appointed our situ∣ation
to be so ambiguous, in order both
to call forth the exertion of those intelli∣gent
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
powers which he hath given us, and
to enforce our dependance on his gracious
aid. <HI>It is not in man that walketh, to direct
his steps.</HI> Surrounded with so many be∣wildering
paths, among which the wisest
are ready to stray, how earnestly should
we implore, and how thankfully should we
receive, that divine illumination, which is
promised in seripture to the pious and
the humble! <HI>The secret of the Lord is with
them that fear him. He will guide them
with his counsel. He will teach them the
way that they should chuse.</HI> But what
must be the fate of him, who, amidst all
the dangers attending human conduct,
neither looks up to Heaven for direction,
nor properly exerts that reason which
God hath given him? If to the most
diligent enquirer, it proves so difficult a
task to distinguish true good from those
fallacious appearances with which it is
ever blended, how should he discover it,
who brings neither patience nor attenti∣on
to the search, who applies to no other
counsellor than present pleasure, and, with
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
a rash and credulous mind, delivers him∣self
up to every suggestion of desire?</P>
<P>This admonition I particularly direct
to those, who are in a period of life too
often characterized by forward presump∣tion,
and headlong pursuit. The self-con∣ceit
of the young, is the great source of
those dangers to which they are exposed;
and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the
age which stands most in need of the
counsel of the wise, should be the most
prone to contemn it. Confident in the opi∣nions
which they adopt, and in the mea∣sures
which they pursue, they seem as if
they understood Solomon to say, not,
<HI>Who knoweth,</HI> but, Who is ignorant of
<HI>what is good for man all the days of his
life?</HI> The bliss to be aimed at, is, in
their opinion, fully apparent. It is not
the danger of mistake, but the failure of
success, which they dread. Activity to
seize, not sagacity to discern, is the only
requisite which they value.—How long
shall it be, ere the fate of your predeces∣fors
in the same course, teach you wis∣dom?
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
How loug shall the experience of
all ages, continue to list its voice to you
in vain? Beholding the ocean on which
you are embarked, covered with wrecks,
are not those fatal signals sufficient to ad∣monish
you of the hidden rock? If, in
Paradise itself, there was a tree which
bare fruit fair to the eye, but mortal
in its effects, how much more, in this
fallen state, may such deceiving appear∣ances
be expected to abound? The whole
state of Nature, is now become a scenc
of delusion to the sensual mind. Hardly
any thing is what it appears to be: And
what flatters most, is always farthest from
reality. There are voices which sing a∣round
you; but whose strains allure to
ruin. There is a banquet spread, where
poison is in every dish. There is a couch
which invites you to repose; but to slum∣ber
upon it, is death. In such a situa∣tion,
<HI>be not high minded, but fear.</HI> Let
sobriety temper your unwary ardour.
Let modesty check your rash presump∣tion.
Let wisdom be the offspring of
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
reflection now, rather than the fruit of
bitter experience hereafter.</P>
<P>II. LET our ignorance of what is good
or evil, correct anxiety about worldly suc∣ces.
As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashness is the vice of youth, the
opposite extreme of immoderate care is
the vice of advancing years. The doc∣trine
which I have illustrated, is equally
adapted for checking both. Since we are
so often betrayed into evil, by the mis∣taken
pursuit of good, care and attention
are requisite, both in forming our choice,
and conducting our pursuit; but since
our attention and care are liable to be so
often frustrated, they should never rise
into trouble of mind.</P>
<P>The ignorance in which we are lest con∣cerning
good and evil, is not such as to
supersede prudence in conduct: For wis∣dom
is still found to <HI>excel folly, as far as
light excelleth darkness.</HI> But it is that de∣gree
of uncertainty which ought to render
us temperate in pursuit; which ought
to calm the perturbation of hope and fear,
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
and to cure the pain of anxiety. Anxiety
is the poison of human life. It is the pa∣rent
of many sins, and of more miseries.
In a world where every thing is so doubt∣ful;
where you may succeed in your
wish, and be miserable; where you may
be disappointed, and be blest through that
disappointment; what means this restless
stir and commotion of mind? Can your
sollicitude alter the course, or unravel the
intricacy of human events? Can your
curiosity pierce through the cloud which
God hath made impenetrable to mortal
eye?—To provide against every apparent
danger, by the employment of the most
promising means, is the office of wisdom.
But at this point, wisdom stops. It com∣mands
you to retire, after you have done
all that was incumbent on you, and to
possess your mind in peace. By going be∣yond
this point; by giving yourselves up
to immoderate concern about unknown
events, you can do nothing to advance
your success, and you do much to ruin
your peace. You plant within your breast
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
the thorn which is long to gall you. To
the vanity of life, you add a vexation of
spirit, which is wholly of your own crea∣tion,
not of God's appointment. For the
dubious goods of this world were never
designed by God to raise such eager at∣tachment.
They were given to man for
his occasional refreshment, not for his
chief felicity. By setting an excessive va∣lue
upon objects which were intended on∣ly
for your secondary regard, you change
their nature. Seeking more satisfaction
from them than they are able to afford,
you receive less than they might give.
From a mistaken care to secure your hap∣piness,
you bring upon yourselves certain
misery.</P>
<P>III. LET our ignorance of good and evil,
determine us to follow Providence, and to
resign ourselves to God. One of the most
important lessons which can be given to
man, is resignation to his Maker; and no∣thing
inculcates it more, than the experi∣ence
of his own inability to guide him∣self.
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
—You know not what is good for
you, in the future periods of life. But
God perfectly knows it; and if you faith∣fully
serve him, you have reason to believe
that he will always consult it. Before
him lies the whole succession of events,
which are to fill up your existence. It is
in his power, to arrange and model them
at his pleasure; and so to adapt one thing
to another, as to fulfil his promise of mak∣ing
them <HI>all work together for good to
those who love him.</HI> Here then, amidst
the agitations of desire, and the perplexi∣ties
of doubt, is one fixed point of rest.
By this let us abide; and dismiss our
anxiety about things uncertain and un∣known.
<HI>Acquaint yourselves with God, and
be at peace.</HI> Secure the <HI>one thing need∣ful.</HI>
Study to acquire an interest in the
divine favour: And you may safely sur∣render
yourselves to the divine admini∣stration.</P>
<P>When tempted to repine at your con∣dition,
reflect how uncertain it is, whether
you should have been happier in any
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
other. Remembering the vanity of many
of your former wishes, and the fallacy
which you have so often experienced in
your schemes of happiness, be thankful
that you are placed under a wiser direc∣tion
than your own. Be not too parti∣cular
in your petitions to Heaven, concern∣ing
your temporal interest. Suffer God
to govern the world according to his own
plan; and only pray, that he would be∣stow
what his unerring wisdom sees to
be best for you on the whole. In a word,
<HI>Commit your way unto the Lord. Trust in
him, and do good.</HI> Follow wherever his
Providence leads; comply with whatever
his will requires; and leave all the rest to
him.</P>
<P>IV. LET our ignorance of what is good
for us in this life, prevent our taking any
unlawful step, in order to compass our
most favourite designs. Were the sinner
bribed with any certain and unquestion∣able
advantage; could the means which
he employs ensure his success, and could
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
that success ensure his comfort; he might
have somewhat to offer in apology for de∣viating
from the path of virtue. But the
doctrine which I have illustrated, deprives
him of every such excuse, and places his
folly in the most striking light. He climbs
the steep rock, and treads on the edge of
a precipice, in order to catch a shadow.
He has cause to dread, not only the un∣certainty
of the event which he wishes to
accomplish, but the nature also of that
event when accomplished. He is not only
liable to that disappointment of success,
which so often frustrates all the designs of
men; but liable to a disappointment still
more cruel, that of being successful and
miserable at once. Riches and pleas res
are the chief temptations to criminal deeds.
Yet those riches, when obtained, may very
possibly overwhelm him with unforeseen
miseries. Those pleasures may cut short
his health and life. And is it for such
doubtful and fallacious rewards, that the
deceiver fills his mouth with lies, the
friend betrays his benefactor, the apostare
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
renounces his faith, and the assassin covers
himself with blood?</P>
<P>Whoever commits a crime, incurs a
certain evil, for a most uncertain good.
What will turn to his advantage in the
course of this life, he cannot with any as∣surance
know. But this he may know, with
full certainty, that by breaking the divine
commandments, he will draw upon his
head that displeasure of the Almighty
which shall crush him for ever. The ad∣vantages
of this world, even when inno∣cently
gained, are uncertain blessings;
when obtained by criminal means, they
carry a curse in their bosom. To the
virtuous, they are often no more than
chaff. To the guilty, they arc always
poison.</P>
<P>V. LET our imperfect knowledge of
what is good or evil, attach us the more
to those few things, concerning which
there can be no doubt of their being tru∣ly
good. Of temporal things, the cata∣logue
of such as belong to this class, it
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
must be confessed, is small. Perhaps the
chief worldly good we should wish to
enjoy, is a sound mind in a sound body.
Health and peace, a moderate fortune, and
a few friends, sum up all the undoubted
articles of temporal felicity. Wise was
the man who addressed this prayer to
God; <HI>Remove far from me vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed
me with food convenient for me. Lest I be
full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord?
or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name
of my God in vain</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8, 9.</NOTE>. He whose wishes, re∣specting
the possessions of this world, are
the most reasonable and bounded, is like∣ly
to lead the safest, and, for that reason,
the most desirable life. By aspiring too
high, we frequently miss the happiness,
which, by a less ambitious aim, we might
have gained. High happiness on earth, is
rather a picture which the imagination
forms, than a reality which is given to
the possession of man.</P>
<P>But with regard to spiritual felicity, we
are not confined to such humble views.
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
Clear and determinate objects are pro∣posed
to our pursuit; and full scope is
given to the most ardent desire. The for∣giveness
of our sins, and the assistance of
God's holy grace, to guide our life; the
improvement of our minds, in knowledge
and wisdom, in piety and virtue; the
protection and favour of the great Father
of all, of the blessed Redeemer of man∣kind,
and of the Spirit of sanctification and
comfort; these are objects, in the pursuit
of which there is no room for hesitation
and distrust, nor any ground for the que∣stion
in my Text, <HI>Who knoweth what is
good for man?</HI> Had Providence spread an
equal obscurity over happiness of every
kind, we might have had some reason to
complain of the vanity of our condition.
But we are not left to so hard a fate. The
Son of God hath descended from heaven,
to be the <HI>Light of the world.</HI> He hath re∣moved
that veil which covered true bliss
from the search of wandering mortals,
and hath taught them the way which
leads to life. Worldly enjoyments are
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
shown to be hollow and deceitful, with
an express intention to direct their affec∣tions
towards those which are spiritual.
The same discoveries which diminish the
value of the one, serve to increase that of
the other. Finally,</P>
<P>VI. LET our ignorance of what is good
or evil here below, lead our thoughts and
desires to a better world. I have endea∣voured
to vindicate the wisdom of Provi∣dence,
by showing the many useful pur∣poses
which this ignorance at present pro∣motes.
It serves to check presumption
and rashness, and to enforce a diligent
exertion of our rational powers, joined
with a humble dependance on divine aid.
It moderates eager passions respecting
worldly success. It inculcates resignation
to the disposal of a Providence which is
much wiser than man. It restrains us
from employing unlawful means in order
to compass our most favourite designs.
It tends to attach us more closely to those
things which are unquestionably good.
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
It is therefore such a degree of ignorance,
as suits the present circumstances of man
better than more complete information
concerning good and evil.</P>
<P>At the same time, the causes which
render this obscurity necessary, too plain∣ly
indicate a broken and corrupted state
of human nature. They show this life to
be a state of trial. They suggest the ideas
of a land of pilgrimage, not of the house
of rest. Low minded and base is he, who
aspires to no higher portion; who could
be satisfied to spend his whole existence
in chasing those treacherous appearances
of good, which so often mock his pursuit.
What shadow can be more vain, than the
life of the greatest part of mankind? Of
all that eager and bustling crowd which
we behold on the earth, how few discover
the path of true happiness? How few can
we find, whose activity has not been mis∣employed,
and whose course terminates
not in confessions of disappointment? Is
this the state, are these the habitations, to
which a rational spirit, with all its high
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
hopes, and great capacities, is to be limited
for ever?—Let us bless that God who
hath set higher prospects before us;
who, by the death and resurrection of his
Son Jesus Christ, hath <HI>begotten us to the
lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re∣served
in the heavens.</HI> Let us show our∣selves
worthy of such a hope, by <HI>setting
our affections upon the things above, not upon
things on the earth.</HI> Let us <HI>walk by faith,
and not by sight;</HI> and, amidst the obscuri∣ty
of this faint and dubious twilight,
console ourselves with the expectation of a
brighter day which is soon to open. This
earth is the land of shadows. But we hope
to pass into the world of realities; where
the proper objects of human desire shall
be displayed; where the substance of that
bliss shall be found, whose image only we

shall betray, no insidious joys
shall sting; but where truth shall be in∣separably
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
united with pleasure; and the
mists which hang over this preliminary
state being dissipated, the perfect know∣ledge
of good shall lead to the full enjoy∣ment
of it for ever.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM iv. 4.</BIBL>
<Q>Commune with your own heart, upon your
bed, and be still.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MUCH communing with themselves
there has always been among man∣kind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S E R M. IX.</NOTE>
though frequently, God knows, to
no purpose, or to a purpose worse than
none. Could we discover the employments
of men in retirement, how often should we
find their thoughts occupied with subjects,
which they would be ashamed to own?
What a large share have ambition and
avarice, at some times the gros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est pas∣sions,
and at other times the meanest
trifles, in their solitary musings? They
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
carry the world, with all its vices, into
their retreat; and may be said to dwell
in the midst of the world, even when
they seem to be alone.</P>
<P>This, surely, is not that sort of commun∣ing
which the Psalmist recommends. For
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not properly <HI>communing with our
heart,</HI> but rather, holding secret inter∣course
with the world. What the Psal∣mist
means to recommend, is religious re∣collection;
that exercise of thought which
is connected with the precept given in the
precceding words, to <HI>stand in awe, and sin
not.</HI> It is to commune with ourselves un∣der
the character of spiritual and immor∣tal
beings; and to <HI>ponder those paths of our
feet</HI> which are leading us to eternity. I
shall, in the first place, show the advan∣tages
of such serious retirement and me∣ditation;
and shall, in the second place,
point out some of the principal subjects
which ought to employ us in our retreat.</P>
<P>The advantages of retiring from the
world, to <HI>commune with our heart,</HI> will be
found to be great, whether we regard our
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
happiness in this world, or our prepara∣tion
for the world to come.</P>
<P>LET us consider them, first, with re∣spect
to our happiness in this world. It
will readily occur to you, that an entire
retreat from worldly affairs is not what
religion require<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; nor does it even enjoin
a great retreat from them. Some stations
of life would not permit this; and there
are few stations which render it necessa∣ry.
The chief field, both of the duty and
of the improvement of man, lies in active
life. By the graces and virtues which
he exercises amidst his fellow-creatures,
he is trained up for heaven. A total re∣treat
from the world, is so far from be∣ing,
according to the doctrine of the Ro∣mish
Church, the perfection of religion,
that, some particular cases excepted, it is
no other than the abuse of it.</P>
<P>But, though entire retreat would lay us
aside from the part for which Providence
chiefly intended us, it is certain, that
without occasional retreat, we must act
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
that part very ill. There will be neither
consistency in the conduct, nor dignity in
the character, of one who sets apart no
share of his time for meditation and re∣flection.
In the heat and bustle of life,
while passion is every moment throwing
false colours on the objects around us,
nothing can be viewed in a just light.
If you wish that Reason should exert her
native power, you must step aside from
the crowd, into the cool and silent shade.
It is there that, with sober and steady eye,
she examines what is good or ill, what is
wise or foolish, in human conduct; she
looks back on the past, she looks forward
to the future, and forms plans, not for the
present moment only, but for the whole
of life. How should that man discharge
any part of his duty aright, who never
suffers his passions to cool? And how
should his passions cool, who is engaged,
without interruption, in the tumult of
the world? This incessant stir may be
called, the perpetual drunkenness of life.
It raises that eager fermentation of spi∣rit,
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
which will be ever sending forth the
dangerous fumes of rashness and folly.
Whereas he who mingles religious re∣treat
with worldly affairs, remains calm,
and master of himself. He is not whirled
round, and rendered giddy, by the agita∣tion
of the world; but, from that sacred
retirement, in which he has been conver∣sant
among higher objects, comes forth
into the world with manly tranquillity,
fortified by the principles which he has
formed, and prepared for every occur∣rence
that may befall.</P>
<P>As he who is unacquainted with retreat
cannot sustain any character with pro∣priety,
so neither can he enjoy the world
with any advantage. Of the two classes
of men who are most apt to be negligent
of this duty, the men of pleasure, and the
men of business, it is hard to say which,
suffer most, in point of enjoyment, from
that neglect. To the former, every mo∣ment
appears to be lost, which partakes
not of the vivacity of amusement. To
connect one plan of gaiety with another,
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
is their sole study; till, in a very short
time, nothing remain but to tread the
same beaten round; to enjoy what they
have already enjoyed, and to see what
they have often seen. Pleasures thus
drawn to the dregs, become vapid and
tasteless. What might have pleased long,
if enjoyed with temperance, and mingled
with retirement, being devoured with
such eager haste, speedily surfeits and
disgusts. Hence, these are the persons,
who, after having run through a rapid
course of pleasure, after having glittered
for a few years in the foremost line of
publick amusements, are the most apt to
fly at last to a melancholy retreat; not
led by religion or reason, but driven by
disappointed hopes, and exhausted spirits,
to the pensive conclusion, that all is <HI>vanity
and vexation of spirit.</HI></P>
<P>If uninterrupted intercourse with the
world wears out the man of pleasure, it
no less oppresses the man of business and
ambition. The strongest spirits must at
length sink under it. The happiest tem∣per
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
must be soured by incessant returns
of the opposition, the inconstancy, and
treachery of men. For he who lives al∣ways
in the bustle of the world, lives in
a perpetual warfare. Here, an enemy
encounters; there, a rival supplants him.
The ingratitude of a friend stings him,
this hour; and the pride of a superiour
wounds him, the next. In vain he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lies
for relief, to trifling amusements. These
may afford a temporary opiate to care;
but they communicate no strength to the
mind. On the contrary, they leave it
more soft and defenceless, when the dis∣turbances
of life renew their attacks.</P>
<P>Let him who wishes for an effectual
cure to all the wounds which the world
can inflict, retire from intercourse with
men, to intercourse with God. When
he enters into his closet, and shuts the
door, let him shut out, at the same time,
all intrusion of worldly care; and dwell
among objects divine and immortal.
Those fair prospects of order and peace,
shall there open to his view, which form
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
the most perfect contrast to the confu∣sion
and misery of this earth. The ce∣lestial
inhabitants quarrel not; among
them there is neither ingratitude, nor
envy, nor tumult. Men may harass one
another; but in the kingdom of God,
concord and tranquillity reign for ever.
—From such objects, there beams upon
the mind of the pious man, a pure and
enlivening light; there is diffused over
his heart, a holy calm. His agitated spi∣rit
re-assumes its firmness, and regains its
peace. The world sinks in its import∣ance;
and the load of mortality and mi∣sery
loses almost all its weight. The <HI>green
pastures</HI> open, and the <HI>still waters</HI> flow
around him, beside which the <HI>Shepherd
of Israel</HI> guides his flock. The disturb∣ances
and alarms, so formidable to those
who are engaged in the tumults of the
world, seem to him only like thunder
rolling afar off; like the noise of distant
waters, whose sound he hears, whose
course he traces, but whose waves touch
him not.—As religious retirement is
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
thus evidently conducive to our happi∣ness
in this life, so,</P>
<P>In the second place, it is absolutely ne∣cessary
in order to prepare us for the life
to come. He who lives always in publick,
cannot live to his own soul. The world
<HI>lieth in wickedness;</HI> and with good reason
the Christian is exhorted, <HI>not to be con∣formed
to it, but transformed by the renew∣ing
of his mind.</HI> Our conversation and
intercourse with the world, is, in several
respects, an education for vice. From
our earliest youth, we are accustomed to
hear riches and honours extolled as the
chief possessions of man; and proposed to
us, as the principal aim of our future pur∣suits.
We are trained up to look with ad∣miration
on the flattering marks of di∣stinction
which they bestow. In the pur∣suit
of those coveted advantages, we see
the multitude around us eager and fer∣vent.
Principles of duty we may, per∣haps,
hear sometimes inculcated; but we
seldom behold them brought into compe∣tition
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
tition with worldly profit. The soft name,
and plausibie colours, under which deceit,
sensuality, and revenge, are presented to
us in common discourse, weaken, by de∣grees,
our natural sense of the distinction
between good and evil. We often meet
with crimes authorized by high examples,
and rewarded with the caresses and smiles
of the world. We discover perhaps, at
last, that those whom we were taught to
reverence, and to regard as our patterns
of conduct, act upon principles no purer
than those of others.—Thus breathing
habitually a contagious air, how certain
is our ruin, upless we sometimes retreat
from this pestilential region, and seek for
proper correctives of the disorders which
are contracted there? Religious retirement
both abates the disease, and furnishes the
remedy. It lessens the corrupting influ∣ence
of the world; and it gives opportu∣nity
for better principles to exert their
power. He who is accustomed to turn
aside, and commune with himself, will,
sometimes at least, hear of truths which
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
the multitude do not tell him. A more
sound instructor will lift his voice, and
awaken within the heart those latent sug∣gestions,
which the world had overpower∣ed
and suppressed.</P>
<P>The acts of prayer and devotion, the
exercises of faith and repentance, all the
great and peculiar duties of the religion
of Christ, necessarily suppose retirement
from the world. This was one chief end
of their institution, that they might be
the means of occasionally sequestering us
from that great scene of vice and the solly,
the continued presence of which is so
hurtful. Solitude is the hallowed ground
which religion hath, in every age, chosen
for her own. There, her inspiration is
felt, and her sacred mysteries elevate the
soul. There, falls the tear of contrition;
there, rises towards heaven the sigh of the
heart; there, melts the soul with all the
tenderness of devotion, and pours itself
forth, before him who made, and him
who redeemed it. How can any one, who
is unacquainted with such employments
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
of mind, be fit for heaven? If heaven be
the habitation of pure affections, and of
intellectual joy, could such a state be re∣lished
by him who is always immersed
among sensible objects, and has never ac∣quired
any taste for the pleasures of the
understanding, and the heart?</P>
<P>The great and the worthy, the pious
and the virtuous, have ever been addicted
to serious retirement. It is the charac∣terestick
of little and srivolous minds, to
be wholly occupied with the vulgar ob∣jects
of life. These fill up their desires,
and supply all the entertainment which
their coarse apprehensions can relish. But
a more refined and enlarged mind leaves
the world behind it, feels a call for higher
pleasures, and feeks them in retreat. The
man of publick spirit has recourse to it,
in order to form plans for general good;
the man of genius, in order to dwell on
his favourite themes; the philosopher, to
pursue his discoveries; the saint, to im∣prove
himself in grace. <HI>Isaac went</HI> out to
meditate in the sields, at the evening tide.
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
David, amidst all the splendour of royalty,
often bears witness, both to the pleasure
which he received, and the benefit which
he reaped, from devout meditation. <HI>I
communed with my own heart, and my spirit
made diligent search. I thought on my ways,
and turned my feet unto God's testimonies. In
the multitude of thoughts within me, his
comforts delight my soul.</HI> Our blessed Sa∣viour
himself, though of all who ever li∣ved
on earth he needed least the assistance
of religious retreat, yet, by his frequent
practice, has done it signal honour. Often
were the garden, the mountain, and the
silence of the night, sought by him, for
intercourse with Heaven. <HI>When he had
sent the multitude away, he went up into a
mountain, apart, to pray.</HI></P>
<P>The advantages of religious retire∣ment
will still more clearly appear, by
considering, as was proposed, in the next
place, some of those great objects which
should there employ our thoughts. I
shall mention only three, which are of
the most plain and acknowledged im∣portance;
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
God, the world, and our own
character.</P>
<P>I. WHEN you retire from the world,
<HI>commune with your hearts</HI> concerning God.
Impressions of Deity, besides their being
the principle of what is strictly termed re∣ligion,
are the great support of all moral
sentiment, and virtuous conduct among
men. But with what difficulty are they
preserved in any due degree of force,
amidst the affairs and avocations of the
world? While the crowd of surrounding
objects is ever rushting on the imagina∣tion,
and occupying the senses and the
heart, what is not only absent from view,
but, by its nature, invisible, is apt to va∣nish
like a shadow. Hence it is given
as the character of wicked men, in scrip∣ture,
that they are <HI>without God in the
world.</HI> They deny not, perhaps, that he
exists; but it is the same to them as
though he did not: For having lost him
from their view, his existence has no ef∣fect
on their conduct. If, at any time,
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
the idea of God rise in their mind, it
rises like a terrifying phantom which
they hasten to expell; and which they
gladly fancy to be an unreal appearance,
because they see it make so little impres∣sion
on others around them.</P>
<P>Let him who retires to serious medita∣tion,
begin with impressing deeply on his
mind this important truth, that there is
undoubtedly a Supreme Governour, who
presides over the universe. But let him
not imagine, that to commune with his
heart concerning God, is to search into
the mysteries of the Divine Nature, or to
attempt a discovery of the whole plan of
Providence. Long enough he may be∣wilder
himself in this maze, without mak∣ing
any proficiency in the practical know∣ledge
of God. Shall he who knows so lit∣tle
of his own nature, or of the nature of
the objects with which he is surrounded,
expect to comprehend the Being who made
him? To commune with ourselves, to any
useful purpose, on this subject, is to bring
home to our souls the internal, authorita∣tive
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
sense of God, as of a Sovereign and
a Father. It is not to speculate about
what is doubtful in his essence, but to
contemplate what is certain in his perfec∣tions.
It is to realize the presence of the
Supreme Being, so as to produce the most
profound veneration; and to awaken the
earnest desire of as near an approach as
our nature will permit, to that great
Fountain of happiness and life.</P>
<P>After this manner was that holy man
affected, who uttered this ardent wish<NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 3.</NOTE>,
<HI>O that I knew where I might find him, that
1 might come even to his seat!</HI>—If with
such a frame of mind you seek after God,
be assured that he is not far from you;
and that, though you are not permitted
as yet to <HI>come to his seat,</HI> you may, at
least, reach the footstool of his throne, and
touch the robe that covers him. In the
midst of your solitary musings, list your
eyes, and behold all nature full of God.
Look up to the firmament, and admire
his glory. Look round on the earth, and
observe his presence every where displayed.
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
If the gay landscape, or the fruitful field,
present themselves to your eye, behold
him smiling upon his works. If the
mountain raise its losty head, or the ex∣panse
of waters roll its tides before you,
contemplate, in those great and solemn
objects, his power and majesty. Nature,
in all its diversities, is a varied mani∣festation
of God. If you were to <HI>take the
wings of the morning, and dwell in the ut∣termost
parts of the sea,</HI> even there you
would find him. For <HI>in him you live and
move.</HI> He fills and animates all space. In
the barren wilderness, as in the peopled
region, you can trace his footsteps; and
in the deepest solitude, you may hear a
voice which testifies of him.</P>
<P>Him, indeed, you are never to confound
with the workmanship of his hands. Na∣ture,
in its most awful or most pleasing
scenes, exhibits no more than different
forms of inanimate matter. But on these
dead forms is impressed the glory of a
living Spirit. The beauty, or the great∣ness,
which appears in them, flows from
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
the Fountain of all greatness and beauty;
in him it centers; of his perfection it re∣slects
an image; and towards him should
lead your view.—In conversing with a
fellow-creature on earth, it is not with his
body we converse, though it is his body
only which we see. From his words and
actions we conceive his mind; with his
mind though invisible, we hold corre∣spondence, and direct towards this spiri∣tual
Essence, our affection and regard. In
like mannner, though here we behold no
more of God than what his works dis∣play,
yet, in those displays, we are cap∣able
of perceiving the Universal Spirit, and
of holding correspondence with this un∣seen
Being, in veneration, gratitude, and
love.</P>
<P>It is thus that a pious man, in his re∣tired
meditations, viewing natural objects
with a spiritual eye, communes with his
heart concerning God. He walks among the
various scenes of Nature, as within
the precincts of a great temple, in the
habitual exercise of devotion. To those
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
discoveries of the Supreme Being in his
works, let him apply the comment of his
word. From the world of Nature, let him
follow God into the world of Grace. When
conducted from the outer courts, into this
inmost sanctuary of the temple, he shall
feel himself brought still more nigh to the
Sacred Presence. In the great plan of Di∣vine
Wisdom, for extirpating the evils pro∣duced
by sin, he shall receive the interpre∣tation
of many of the hidden mysteries of
Nature. He shall discover in Christ, the
Deity made, in some degree, visible to
sense. In the beneficent works which he
performed, and the gracious undertaking
which he accomplished, he shall behold
the <HI>brightness of the Father's glory,</HI> and
shall discern it to be <HI>full of grace and
truth.</HI>—From the sacred retreat, wherein
his thoughts have been thus employed,
he returns to the world like a superiour
being. He carries into active life those
pure and elevating sentiments, to which
the giddy crowd are strangers. A certain
odour of sanctity remains upon his mind,
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
which, for a while at least, will repell the
contagion of the world.</P>
<P>II. COMMUNE with your heart, in the
season of retirement, concerning the world.
The world is the great deceiver, whose fal∣lacious
arts it highly imports us to detect.
But in the midst of its pleasures and pur∣suits,
the detection is impossible. We
tread, as within an inchanted circle, where
nothing appears as it truly is. It is only
in retreat, that the charm can be broken.
Did men employ that retreat, not in car∣rying
on the delusion which the world has
begun, not in forming plans of imagi∣nary
bliss, but in subjecting the happi∣ness
which the world affords to a strict
discussion, the spell would dissolve; and
in the room of the unreal prospects, which
had long amused them, the nakedness of
the world would appear.</P>
<P>Prepare yourselves, then, to encounter
the light of truth. Resolve rather to bear
the disappointment of some flattering
hopes, than to wander for ever in the
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
paradise of fools. While others meditate
in secret on the means of attaining world∣ly
success, let it be your employment to
scrutinize that success itself. Calculate
fairly to what it amounts; and whether
you are not losers on the whole, by your
apparent gain. Look back, for this pur∣pose,
on your past life. Trace it from
your earliest youth; and put the question
to yourselves, What have been its happiest
periods? Were they those of quiet and
innocence, or those of ambition and in∣trigue?
Has your real enjoyment uni∣formly
kept pace with what the world
calls prosperity? As you advanced in
wealth or station, did you proportionably
advance in happiness? Has success, almost
in any one instance, fulfilled your expect∣ations?
Where you reckoned upon most
enjoyment, have you not often found
least? Wherever guilt entered into your
pleasures, did not its sting long remain,
after the gratification was past?—Such
questions as these, candidly answered,
would in a great measure unmask the
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
world. They would cxpose the vanity of
its pretensions; and convince you that
there are other springs than those which
the world affords, to which you must ap∣ply
for happiness.</P>
<P>While you commune with your heart
concerning what the world now is, con∣silder
also what it will one day appear
to be. Anticipate the awful moment
of your bidding it an eternal farewell.
Think, what reflections shall most pro∣bably
arise, when you are quitting the
field, and looking back on the scene of
action. In what light will your closing
eyes contemplate those vanities which
now shine so bright, and those interests
which now swell into such high import∣ance?
What part will you then wish to
have acted? What shall then appear mo∣mentous,
what trisling, in human con∣duct?
—Let the sober sentiments which
such anticipations suggest, temper now
your misplaced ardour. Let the last con∣clusions
which you shall form, enter into
the present estimate which you make of
the world, and of life.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264"/>
Moreover, in communing with your∣selves
concerning the world, contemplate
it as subject to the divine dominion. The
greater part of men behold nothing more
than the rotation of human affairs. They
see a great crowd ever in motion; the for∣tunes
of men alternately rising and fall∣ing;
virtue often distressed, and prosperi∣ty
appearing to be the purchase of world∣ly
abilities and wisdom. But this is only
the outside of things. Behind the cur∣tain,
there is a far greater scene, which is
beheld only by the retired, religious spec∣tator.
List up that curtain, when you are
alone with God. View the world with
the eye of a Christian; and you shall see,
that while <HI>man's heart deviseth his way, it
is the Lord who directeth his steps.</HI> You
shall see, that however men appear to
move and act after their own pleasure,
they are, nevertheless, retained in secret
bonds by the Almighty, and all their
operations rendered subservient to the
ends of his moral government. You shall
see him obliging <HI>the wrath</HI> of man to
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
praise him; punishing the sinner by means
of his own iniquities; from the trials of
the righteous, bringing forth their reward;
and to a state of seeming universal con∣fusion,
preparing the wisest and most equi∣table
issue. While the <HI>fashion of this world</HI>
is passing fast away, you shall discern the
glory of another, rising to succeed it. You
shall behold all human events, our griefs
and our joys, our love and our hatred,
our character and memory, absorbed in
the ocean of eternity; and no trace of our
present existence lest, except that it shall
be for ever <HI>well with the righteous, and
ill with the wicked.</HI>—Such a view of the
world, frequently presented to our minds,
could not fail to enforce those solemn con∣clusions;
<HI>There is no wisdom, nor counsel,
against the Lord. Fear God, and keep his
commandments; for this is the whole of man.
What is a man prosited, if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own, soul?</HI></P>
<P>III. COMMUNE with your heart, con∣cerning
yourselves and your real charac∣ter.
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
To acquire a thorough knowledge of
ourselves, is an attainment no less difficult
than important. For men are generally
unwilling to see their own imperfections;
and when they are willing to enquire in∣to
them, their self-love imposes on their
judgment. Their intercourse with one
another assists the delusion to which, of
themselves, they are prone. For the or∣dinary
commerce of the world, is a com∣merce
of flattery and falshood; where re∣ciprocally
they deceive, and are deceived;
where every one appears under an assum∣ed
form; professes esteem which he does
not feel; and bestows praise in order to
receive it. It is only in retreat, where
those false semblances disappear, and those
flattering voices are silent, that a man
can learn to <HI>think soberly of himself, and as
he ought to think.</HI></P>
<P>It has been said, that there are three
characters which every man sustains; and
these often extremely different from one
another: One, which he possesses in his
own opinion; another, which he carries
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
in the estimation of the world; and a
third, which he bears in the judgment
of God. It is only the last which ascer∣tains
what he really is.—Whether the
character which the world forms of you,
be above or below the truth, imports you
not much to know. But it is of eternal
consequence, that the character which you
possess in your own eyes, be formed up∣on
that which you bear in the sight of
God. In order to try it by this great
standard, you must lay aside, as much as
possible, all partiality to yourselves; and,
in the season of retirement, explore your
heart with such accurate scrutiny, as may
bring your hidden defects to light.</P>
<P>Enquire, for this purpose, whether you
be not conscious that the fair opinion
which the world entertains of you, is
founded on their partial knowledge both
of your abilities, and your virtues? Would
you be willing that all your actions should
be publickly canvassed? Could you bear
to have your thoughts laid open? Are
there no parts of your life which you
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
would be uneasy if an enemy could dis∣cover?
In what light, then, must these
appear to God? When you have kept
free of vice, has your innocence pro∣ceeded
from purity of principle, or from
worldly motives? Rises there no envy
or malignity within you, when you com∣pare
your own condition with that of
others? Have you been as sollicitous to
regulate your heart, as to preserve your
manners from reproach? Professing your∣selves
to be Christians, has the Spirit of
Christ appeared in your conduct? Declar∣ring
that you hope for immortality, has
that hope surmounted undue attachments
to the present life?</P>
<P>Such investigation as this, seriously
pursued, might produce to every man
many discoveries of himself; discoveries,
not pleasing, perhaps, to vanity, but sa∣lutary
and useful. For he can be only a
flatterer, but no true friend to himself,
who aims not at knowing his own de∣fects,
as well as virtues. By imposing on
the world, he may carry on some plan of
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
fancied profit; but by imposing on his
own heart, what can he propose to gain?
<HI>He feedeth of ashes: A deceived heart
hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver
his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my
right hand</HI><NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">Isa. xliv. 20.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>THUS I have set before you some of
those great objects, which ought to em∣ploy
your meditation in religious retire∣ment.
I have endeavoured to introduce
you into a proper intercourse with your
heart, concerning God, the world, and
your own character. Let this intercourse
terminate in fixing the principles of your
future conduct. Let it serve to introduce
consistency into your life. Nothing can
be more wavering and disjointed, than the
behaviour of those who are wholly men
of the world, and have never been inured
to commune with themselves. Dissipa∣tion
is a more frequent cause of their
ruin, than determined impiety. It is
not so much because they have adopted
bad principles, as because they have ne∣ver
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
attended to principles of any kind,
that their lives are so full of incoherence
and disorder.—You hover on the borders
of sin and duty. One day, you read the
scriptures, you hear religious discourses,
and form good resolutions. Next day,
you plunge into the world, and forget
the serious impression, as if it had been
never made. The impression is again re∣called,
and again effaced; and in this
circle your life revolves. Is such conduct
worthy of creatures endowed with intel∣ligent
powers? Shall the close of life
overtake you, before you have determin∣ed
how to live? Shall the day never
come, that is to find you steady in your
views, decided in your plans, and en∣gaged
in a course of action which your
mind approves?—If you wish that day
ever to arrive, retirement and meditation
must first bring you home to yourselves,
from the dissipation in which you are
now scattered; must teach you to fix such
aims, and to lay down such rules of con∣duct,
as are suitable to rational and im∣mortal
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
beings. Then will your character
become uniform and respectable. Then,
you may hope that your life will proceed
in such a train, as shall prepare you,
when it is finished, for joining the society
of more exalted spirits.</P>

<Q>Cornelius—A devout man—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT religion is essential to the
welfare of man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE> can be proved by
the most convincing arguments. But
these, how demonstrative soever, are in∣sufficient
to support its authority over
human conduct. For arguments may
convince the understanding, when they
cannot conquer the passions. Irresistable
they seem in the calm hours of retreat;
but, in the season of action, they often
vanish into smoke. There are other and
more powerful springs, which influence
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
the great movements of the human frame.
In order to operate with success on the
active powers, the heart must be gained.
Sentiment and affection must be brought
to the aid of reason. It is not enough
that men believe religion to be a wise and
rational rule of conduct, unless they re∣lish
it as agreeable, and find it to carry
its own reward. Happy is the man, who,
in the conflict of desire between God and
the world, can oppose, not only argument
to argument, but pleasure to pleasure;
who, to the external allurements of sense,
can oppose the internal joys of devotion;
and to the uncertain promises of a flatter∣ing
world, the certain experience of that
<HI>peace of God which passeth understanding,
keeping his mind and heart.</HI>—Such is the
temper and spirit of a <HI>devout man.</HI> Such
was the character of Cornelius, that good
centurion, whose <HI>prayers and alms are said</HI>
to have <HI>come up in memorial before God.</HI>
Of this character I intend, through Divine
assistance, to discourse; and shall endea∣vour,
I. To explain the nature of devotion;
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
II. To justify, and recommend it; and,
III. To rectify some mistakes concerning
it.</P>
<P>I. DEVOTION is the lively exercise
of those affections, which we owe to the
Supreme Being. It comprehends several
emotions of the heart, which all termi∣nate
on the same great object. The chief
of them are, veneration, gratitude, desire,
and resignation.</P>
<P>It implies, first, profound veneration of
God. By veneration, I understand a dis∣position,
compounded of awe, and of love;
the disposition which, of all others, it best
becomes creatures to bear towards their
infinitely perfect Creator. Awe is the
first sentiment which rises in the soul, at
the view of his greatness. But, in the
heart of a devout man, it is a solemn
and elevating, not a dejecting, emotion;
for he glows, rather than trembles, in the
Divine presence. It is not the supersti∣tious
dread of unknown power, but the
homage yielded by the heart to him who
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
is, at once, the greatest and the best of Be∣ings.
Omnipotence, viewed alone, would
be a formidable object. But, considered
in conjunction with the moral perfections
of the Divine Nature, it serves to heighten
devotion. Goodness affects the heart with
double energy, when residiing in one so
exalted. The goodness which we adore
in him, is not like that which is common
among men, a weak, mutable, undis∣cerning
fondness, ill qualified to be the
ground of assured trust. It is the good∣ness
of a perfect Governour, acting upon a
regular, extensive plan; a steady principle
of benevolence, conducted by wisdom;
which, subject to no <HI>variableness or sha∣dow
of turning,</HI> free from all partiality and
caprice, incapable of being either soothed
by flattery, or ruffled by resentment, re∣sembles,
in its calm and equal lustre, the
eternal serenity of the highest heavens.</P>
<P>Thy mercy, O Lord! is in the heavens; and
thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Thy
righteousness is like the great mountains, and
thy judgments are a great depth.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="276"/>
Such are the conceptions of the great
God, which fill with veneration the heart
of a devout man. His veneration is not
confined to acts of immediate worship.
It is the habitual temper of his soul. Not
only when engaged in prayer of praise,
but in the silence of retirement, and even
amidst the occupations of the world, the
Divine Being dwells upon his thoughts.
No place, and no object, appear to him
void of God. On the works of Nature,
he views the impression of his hand; and
in the actions of men, he traces the ope∣ration
of his Providence. Whatever he
beholds on earth, that is beautiful or fair,
that is great or good, he refers to God,
as to the supreme origin of all the ex∣cellence
which is any where scattered
through his works. From those effects,
he rises to the first cause. From those
streams, he ascends to the fountain whence
they flow. By those rays, he is led to that eternal source of light in which they
centre.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="277"/>
DEVOTION implies, secondly, sincere
gratitude to God, for all his benefits.
This is a warmer emotion than simple
veneration. Veneration looks up to the
Deity, as he is in himself: Gratitude re∣gards
what he is towards us. When a de∣vout
man surveys this vast universe, where
beauty and goodness are every-where pre∣dominant;
when he reflects on those num∣berless
multitudes of creatures, who, in
their different stations, enjoy the bles∣sings
of existence; and when at the same
time he looks up to an Universal Father,
who hath thus filled creation with life
and happiness, his heart glows within
him. He adores that disinterested good∣ness,
which prompted the Almighty to
raise up so many orders of intelligent
beings, not that he might receive, but
that he might give and impart; that he
might pour forth himself, and communi∣cate
to the spirits which he formed, some
emanations of his felicity.</P>
<P>The goodness of this Supreme Benefactor
he gratefully contemplates, as displayed in
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
his own state. He reviews the events of
his life; and, in every comfort which has
sweetened it, he discerns the Divine hand.
Does he remember with affection the pa∣rents
under whose care he grew up, and
the companions with whom he possed his
youthful life? Is he now happy, in his
family rising around him; in the spouse
who loves him, or in the children who
give him comfort and joy? Into every ten∣der
remembrance of the past, and every
pleasing enjoyment of the present, devo∣tion
enters; for in all those beloved ob∣jects,
it recognizes God. The communi∣cation
of love from heart to heart, is an
effusion of his goodness. From his inspi∣ration,
descends all the friendship which
ever glowed on earth; and therefore, to
him it justly returns in gratitude, and ter∣minates
on him.</P>
<P>But this life, with all its interests, is
but a small part of human existence. A
devout man looks forward to immortali∣ty,
and discovers higher subjects of grati∣tude
to Heaven. He views himself as a
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
guilty creature, whom Divine benignity
has received into grace; whose forfeited
hopes it has restored; and to whom it
has opened the most glorious prospects of
future felicity. Such generosity shown
to the fallen and miserable, is still more
assecting to the heart, than favours con∣ferred
on the innocent. He contemplates,
with astonishment, the labours of the Son
of God, in accomplishing redemption for
men; and his soul overflows with thank∣fulness
to him <HI>who loved us, and washed
us from our sins in his own blood.—what shall
1 render to the Lord for all his benefits? Bless
the Lord, O my soul! and all that is within
me, bless his holy name! who forgiveth
all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy dis∣cases;
who redeemeth thy life from destruc∣tion,
and crowneth thee with loving kind∣ness,
and with tender mercies.</HI></P>
<P>DEVOTION implies, thirdly, the defire
of the soul after the favour of the Supreme
Being, as its chief good, and final rest.
To inferiour enjoyments, the devout man
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
allots inferiour and secondary attach∣ment.
He disclaims not every earthly af∣fection.
He pretends not to renounce all
pleasure in the friends, and the comforts,
of his present state. Such an unnatural
renunciation humanity forbids, and reli∣gion
cannot require. But from these he
expects not his supreme bliss. He diseerns
the vanity which belongs to them all;
and beyond the circle of mutable objects
which surround him, he aspires after some
principle of more perfect felicity, which
shall not be subject to change or decay.
But where is this complete and perma∣nent
good to be found? Ambition pur∣sues
it in courts and palaces; and returns
from the pursuit, loaded with sorrows.
Pleasure seeks it among sensual joys; and
retires with the confession of disappoint∣ment.
<HI>The deep faith, it is not in me; and the
sea faith, it ts not with me. It cannot be gotten
for gold; neither shall silver be weighed for
the price thereof. Its place is not in the land
of the living. True happiness dwells with
God; and from the light of his countenance,</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
it beams upon the devout man. His voice
is, <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
there is none upon earth that I desire beside
thee.</HI> After exploring heaven and earth
for happiness, they seem to him a mighty
void, a wilderness of shadows, where all
would be empty and unsubstantial with∣out
God. But in his favour and love, he
finds what supplies every defect of tem∣poral
objects; and assures tranquillity to
his heart, amidst all the changes of his
existence. <HI>Thou shalt guide me with thy
counsel; and thou shalt receive me to thy
glory. My flesh and my heart faileth; but
God is the strength of my heart, and my por∣tion
for ever.</HI></P>
<P>FROM these sentiments and affections,
Devotion advances, fourthly, to an en∣tire
resignation of the soul to God. It is
the consummation of trust and hope. It
banishes anxious cares, and murmuring
thoughts. It reconciles us to every ap∣pointment
of Divine Providence; and re∣solves
every wish into the desire of pleas∣ing
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
him, whom our hearts adore. Its
genuine breathings are to this effect:
“Conduct me, O God! in what path
soever seemeth good to thee. In no∣thing
shall I ever arraign thy sacred
will. Dost thou require me to part
with any worldly advantages, for the
sake of virtue and a good conscience?
I give them up. Dost thou command
me to relinquish my friends, or my
country? At thy call I chearfully
leave them. Dost thou summon me
away from this world? Lo! I am
ready to depart. Thou hast made,
thou hast redeemed me, and I am
thine. Myself, and all that belongs to
me, I surrender to thy disposal. Let
the men of the world have <HI>their portion
in this life, and be filled with its hidden
treasures.</HI> Be it mine, to <HI>behold thy face
in righteousness; and when I awake, to
be satisfied with thy likeness.”</HI></P>
<P>This, surely, is one of the noblest acts
of which the human mind is capable,
when thus, if we may be allowed the ex∣pression,
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
it unites itself with God. Nor
can any devotion be genuine, which in∣spires
not sentiments of this nature. For
devotion is not to be considered as a
transient glow of affection, occasioned by
some casual impressions of Divine good∣ness,
which are suffered to remain un∣connected
with the conduct of life. It is
a powerful principle, which penetrates
the inmost soul; which purifies the af∣fections
from debasing attachments; and,
by a fixed and steady regard to God, sub∣dues
every sinful passion, and forms the
inclinations to piety and virtue.</P>
<P>SUCH in general are the dispositions
that constitute devotion. It is the union
of veneration, gratitude, desire, and re∣signation.
It expresses, not so much the
performance of any particular duty, as
the spirit which must animate all religious
duties. It stands opposed, not merely to
downright vice; but to a heart which is
cold, and insensible to sacred things;
which, from compulsion perhaps, and a
<PB N="275" REF="284"/>
sense of interest, preserves some regard to
the Divine commands, but obeys them
without ardour, love, or joy. I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To recommend this devout spirit
to your imitation. I begin with observ∣ing,
that it is of the unmost consequence
to guard against extremes of every kind
in religion. We must beware, lest, by
seeking to avoid one rock, we split upon
another. It has been long the subject of
remark, that supersttition and enthusiasm
are two capital sources of delusion; su∣perstition,
on the one hand, attaching
men with immoderate zeal, to the ritual
and external part of religion; and enthu∣siasm,
on the other, directing their whole
attention to internal emotions, and my∣stical
communications with the spiritual
world; while neither the one, nor the
other, has paid sufficient regard to the
great moral duties of the Christian life.
But, running with intemperate eagerness,
from these two great abuses of religion,
men have neglected to observe, that there
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
are extremes opposite to each of them,
into which they are in hazard of precipi∣tating
themselves. Thus the horrour of su∣perstition
has sometimes reached so far, as
to produce contempt for all external insti∣tutions;
as if it were possible for religion
to subsist in the world, without forms of
worship, or publick acknowledgment of
God. It has also happened, that some
who in the main are well affected to the
cause of goodness, observing that persons
of a devout turn, have at times been car∣ried
by warm affections into unjustifiable
excesses, have thence hastily concluded,
that all devotion was akin to enthusi∣asm;
and, separating religion totally from
the heart and affections, have reduced it
to a frigid observance of what they call
the rules of virtue. This is the extreme
which I purpose at present to combat, by
showing you, first, That true devotion is
rational, and well founded; next, That it
is of the highest importance to every other
part of religion and virtue; and, lastly,
That it is most conducive to our happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286"/>
IN the first place, True devotion is ra∣tional,
and well founded. It takes its rise
from affections, which are essential to the
human frame. We are formed by Nature,
to admire what is great, and to love what
is amiable. Even inanimate objects have
power to excite those emotions. The mag∣nificent
prospects of the natural world, fill
the mind with reverential awe. Its beau∣tiful
scenes create delight. When we sur∣vey
the actions and behaviour of our fel∣low-creatures,
the affections glow with
greater ardour; and, if to be unmoved,
in the former case, argues a defect of sen∣sibility
in our powers, it discovers, in the
latter, an odious hardness and depravity
in the heart. The tenderness of an affec∣tionate
parent, the generosity of a for∣giving
enemy, the publick spirit of a pa∣triot
or a hero, often fill the eyes with
tears, and swell the breast with emotions
too big for utterance. The object of those
affections is frequently raised above us, in
condition and rank. Let us suppose him
raised also above us, in nature. Let us
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
imagine, that an angel, or any being of
superiour order, had condescended to be
our friend, our guide, and patron; no
person, sure, would hold the exaltation of
his benefactor's character, to be an argu∣ment
why he should love and revere him
less.—Strange! that the attachment and
veneration, the warmth and overflowing
of heart, which excellence and goodness
on every other occasion command, should
begin to be accounted irrational, as soon as
the Supreme Being becomes their object.
For what reason must human sensibility
be extinct towards him alone? Are all
benefits entitled to gratitude, except the
highest and the best? Shall goodness
cease to be amiable, only because it is
perfect?</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be said, that an un∣known
and invisible Being, is not quali∣fied
to raise affection in the human heart.
Wrapt up in the mysterious obscurity of
his nature, he escapes our search, and af∣fords
no determinate object to our love
or desire. We go forward, but he is not
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
there; and backward, but we cannot per∣ceive
him; on the lest hand, where he
worketh, but we cannot behold him: He
hideth himself on the right hand, that we
cannot see him<NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding this
obscurity, is there any being in the uni∣verse
more real and certain, than the Cre∣ator
of the world, and the Supporter of
all existence? Is he, <HI>in whom we live and
move,</HI> too distant from us, to excite de∣votion?
His form and essence, indeed,
we cannot see; but to be unseen, and
imperfectly known, in many other in∣stances,
precludes neither gratitude nor
love. It is not the sight, so much as the
strong conception, or deep impression, of
an object, which affects the passions. We
glow with admiration of personages, who
have lived in a distant age. Whole na∣tions
have been transported with zeal and
affection, for the generous hero, or pu∣blick
deliverer, whom they knew only by
same. Nay, properly speaking, the direct
object of our love, is, in every case, invi∣sible.
For that on which affecion is
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
placed, is the mind, the soul, the internal
character of our fellow-creatures; which,
surely, is no less concealed, than the Di∣vine
Nature itself is, from the view of
sense. From actions, we can only infer
the dispositions of men; from what we see
of their behaviour, We collect what is in∣visible;
but the conjecture which we form,
is, at beft, imperfect; and when their ac∣tions
excite our love, much of their heart
remains still unknown. I ask then, in
what respect God is less qualified than
any other being, to be an object of affec∣tion?
Convinced that he exists; beholding
his goodness spread abroad in his works,
exerted in the government of the world,
displayed in some measure to sense, in the
actions of his Son Jesus Christ; are we
not furnished with every essential requi∣site
which the heart demands, in order
to indulge the most warm, and at the
same time the most rational emotions?</P>
<P>If these considerations justify the rea∣sonableness
of devotion, as expressed in
veneration, love, and gratitude, the same
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
train of thought will equally justify it,
when appearing in the forms of desire,
delight, or resignation. The latter are, in∣deed,
the consequence of the former. For
we cannot but desire some communica∣tion
with what we love; and will natu∣rally
resign ourselves to one, on whom we
have placed the full confidence of affec∣tion.
The aspirations of a devout man
after the favour of God, are the effects of
that earnest wish for happiness, which
glows in every breast. All men have some∣what
that may be called the object of their
devotion; reputation, pleasure, learning,
riches, or whatever apparent good has
strongly attached their heart. This be∣comes
the center of attraction, which ha∣bitually
draws them towards it; which
quickens and regulates all their motions.
While the men of the world are thus
classed, and employed, according to the
objects which they severally worship, shall
he only who directs his devotion towards
the Supreme Being, be excluded from a
place in the system of rational conduct?
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
or be allowed no passions, which, in the
course of their pursuit, may melt with
tenderness, or rise into fervour?—Having
vindicated the reasonableness of devotion,
I come,</P>
<P>IN the second place, to show its im∣portance,
and the high place which it
possesses in the system of religion. I ad∣dress
myself now to those, who, though
they reject not devotion as irrational, yet
consider it as an unnecessary refinement; an
attainment which may be safely left to re∣cluse
and sequestered persons, who aim at
uncommon sanctity. The solid and ma∣terial
duties of a good life, they hold to
be in a great measure independent of de∣vout
affection; and think them sufficient∣ly
supported, by their necessary connec∣tion
with our interest, both in this and in
a future world. They ensist much upon
religion being a calm, a sober, and ratio∣nal
principle of conduct.—I admit that
it is very laudable to have a rational re∣ligion.
But 1 must admonish you, that it
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
is both reproachful and criminal, to have
an insensible heart. If we reduce religion
into so cool a state, as not to admit love,
affection, and desire, we shall leave it in
possession of small influence over human
life. Look abroad into the world, and
observe how few act upon deliberate and
rational views of their true interest. The
bulk of mankind are impelled by their,
feelings. They are attracted by appear∣ances
of good. Taste and inclination rule
their conduct. To direct their inclination
and taste towards the highest objects; to
form a relish within them, for virtuous and
spiritual enjoyment; to introduce religion
into the heart, is the province of devotion;
and hence arises its importance to the in∣terests
of goodness.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this doctrine, the great
Author of our religion, who well <HI>knew
what was in man,</HI> laid the foundation of
his whole system in the regeneration of
the heart. The change which was to be
accomplished on his followers, he did not
purpose to effect, merely by regulating
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
their external conduct; but by forming
within them a new nature; by <HI>taking
away the heart of stone, and giving them
a heart of ftesh,</HI> that is, a heart relenting
and tender, yielding to the Divine im∣pulse,
and readily susceptible of devout
impressions. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God, with all thy heart, and mind, and soul,
and strength: This is the first and great
commandment. My son, give me thy heart,</HI>
is the call of God to each of us; And, in∣deed,
if the heart be withheld, it is not
easy to conceive, what other offering we
can present, that will be acceptable to
him.</P>
<P>Of what nature must that man's reli∣gion
be, who professes to worship God,
and to believe in Christ, and yet raises
his thoughts towards God, and his Savi∣our,
without any warmth of gratitude or
love? I speak not of those occasional de∣cays
of pious affection, to which the best
are subject, but of a total insensibility to
this part of religion. Surely, let the out∣ward
behaviour be ever so irreproachable,
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
there must be some essential defect in a
heart, which remains always unmoved at
the view of infinite goodness. The affec∣tions
cannot, in this case, be deemed to
flow in their natural channel. Some con∣cealed
malignity must have tainted the in∣ward
frame. This is not the man whom
you would chuse for your bosom-friend;
or whose heart you could expect to an∣swer,
with reciprocal warmth, to yours.
His virtue, if it deserve that name, is
not of the most amiable fort; and may,
with reason, receive the appellation (often
injudiciously bestowed) of cold and dry
morality. Such a person must, as yet, be
<HI>far from the kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As devotion is thus essential to religion
in its principle, so it enters into the pro∣per
discharge of all its duties. It diffuses
an auspicious influence over the whole of
virtue. The prevailing temper of the mind
is formed by its most frequent employ∣ments.
Intercourse with Supreme per∣fection
cannot, therefore, but ennoble and
improve it. The pure love of God, natu∣rally
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
rally connects itself with the love of man.
Hence, devotion has been often found a
powerful instrument, in humanizing the
manners of men, and taming their unruly
passions. It smooths what is rough, and
softens what is sierce, in our nature. It is
the great purifier of the affections. It in∣sipires
contempt of the low gratifications
belonging to animal life. It promotes a
humble and chearful contentment with
our lot; and subdues that eager desire of
riches and of power, which has filled this
unhappy world with crimes and misery.
Finally, it bestows that enlargement of
heart in the service of God, which is the
great principle, both of perseverance, and
of progress, in virtue. He who, unac∣quainted
with devout affections, sets him∣self
to keep the Divine commandments,
will advance in obedience with a slow
and languid pace; like one who, carrying
a heavy burden, toils to mount the hill.
But he whose heart devotion has warmed,
will proceed on his way, chearful and re∣joicing.
The one performs his duty, only
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
because it is commanded; the other, be∣cause
he loves it. The one is inclined to
do no more, than necessity requires; the
other seeks to excell. The one looks for
his reward in somewhat besides religion;
the other finds it in religion itself: It is
<HI>his meat and drink to do the will of that
heavenly Father,</HI> whom he loves and adores.
Which of these two are likely to make the
greatest. improvement in goodness, is easi∣ly
discerned. Let us now consider,</P>
<P>IN the third place, the influence of
devotion on the happiness of life. What∣ever
promotes and strengthens virtue,
whatever calms and regulates the tem∣per,
is a source of happiness. Devotion,
as I have just now shown, produces those
effects in a remarkable degree. It in∣spires
composure of spirit, mildness, and
benignity; weakens the painful, and che∣rishes
the pleasing emotions; and, by these
means, carries on the life of a pious man
in a smooth and placid tenor.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="297"/>
Besides exerting this habitual influence
on the mind, devotion opens a field of
enjoyments, to which the vitious are entire
strangers; enjoyments the more valuable,
as they peculiarly belong to retirement
when the world leaves us, and to adver∣sity
when it becomes our foc. These are
the two seasons, for which every wise man
would most wish to provide some hidden
store of comfort. For let him be placed
in the most favourable situation which
the human state admits, the world can
neither always amuse him, nor always
shield him from distress. There Will be
many hours of vacuity, and many of de∣jection,
in his life. If he be a stranger to
God, and to devotion, how dreary will
the gloom of solitude often prove? with
what oppressive weight will sickness, dis∣appointment,
or old age, fall upon his
spirits? But, for those pensive periods,
the pious man has a relief prepared. From
the tiresome repetition of the common va∣nities
of life, or from the painful corrosion
of its cares and sorrows, devotion trans∣ports
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
him into a new region; and sur∣rounds
him there with such objects as are
the most fitted to chear the dejection, to
calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds
of hia heart. If the world has been empty
and delusive, it gladdens him with the
prospect of a higher and better order of
thing?, about to arise. If men have been
ungrateful and base, it displays before him
the faithfulness of that Supreme Being,
who, though every other friend fail, will
never forsake him.—Consult your experi∣ence,
and you will find that the two great∣est
sources of inward joy, are, the exer∣cise
of love directed towards a deserving
object, and the exercise of hope termi∣nating
on some high and assured happi∣ness.
Both these are supplied by devo∣tion;
and therefore we have no reason to
be surprised, if, on some occasions, it fill
the hearts of good men with a satisfaction
not to be expressed.</P>
<P>The refined pleasures of a pious mind,
are, in many respects, superiour to the
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
coarse gratifications of sense. They are
pleasures which belong to the highest
powers, and best affections of the soul;
whereas, the gratifications of sence reside
in the lowest region of our nature. To
the one, the soul stoops below its native
dignity. The other, raise it above it∣self.
The one, leave always a-comfortless,
often a mortifying remembrance behind
them. The other, are reviewed with ap∣plause
and delight. The pleasures of
sense resemble a foaming torrent, which,
after a disordcrly course, speedily runs
out, and leaves an empty and offensive
channel. But the plcasures of devotion
resemble the equable current of a pure
river, which enlivens the fields through
which it passes, and diffuses verdure and
fertility along its banks.—To thee, O
Devotion! we owe the highest improve∣ment
of our nature, and much of the en∣joyment
of our life. Thou art the sup∣port
of our virtue, and the rest of our
souls in this turbulent world. Thou com∣posest
the thoughts. Thou calmest the
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
passions. Thou exaltest the heart. Thy
communications, and thine only, are im∣parted
to the low, no less than to the
high; to the poor, as well as to the rich.
In thy presence, worldly distinctions ecase;
and under thy influence, worldly sorrows
are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the
wounded mind. Thy sanctuary is ever
open to the miserable; inaccessible only
to the unrighteous and impure. Thou
beginnest on earth the temper of heaven.
In thee, the hosts of angels and blessed
spirits eternally rejoice.—It now remains,
that,</P>
<P>III. I ENDEAVOUR to correct some er∣rors,
into which men are apt to fall con∣cerning
devotion. For it is but too ob∣vious,
that errors are often committed in
this part of religion. These frequently
disfigure its appearance before the world,
and subject it to unjust reproach. Let us
therefore attend deliberately to its nature,
so as to distinguish. pure and rational de∣votion,
of which I have hitherto treated,
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
from that which is, in any degree, spuri∣ous
and adulterated.</P>
<P>In the first, place. It is an error to place
devotion in the mere performance of any
external act of worship. Prayer and
praise, together with the ordinances pe∣culiar
to Christian religion, are the ap∣pointed
means of raising the heart towards
God. They are the instituted signs of de∣votion;
the language in which it natu∣rally
expresses itself. But let us remem∣ber,
that they are signs and expressions
only; and we all know, that, in various
cases, these may not correspond to the
thing signified. It is in the disposition of
the heart, not in the motion of the lips,
or in the posture of the body, that devo∣tion
consists. The heart may pray or
praise, when no words are uttered. But
if the heart be unconcerned or ill affected,
all the words we can utter, how properly
framed soever, are no other than empty
and unacceptable sounds in the ear of the
Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302"/>
IN the second place, It is an error to
conceive the pleasures and advantages of
devotion, to be indiscriminately open to
all. Devotion, like many parts of reli∣gion,
may in some lights be considered as
a privilege, and in others, as a duty. It is
the duty of all, to love God, and to resign
themselves to his will. But it is the privi∣lege
of good men only, to rejoice in God,
and to confide in his friendship. Hence,
a certain preparation is requisite, for the
enjoyment of devotion in its whole extent.
Not only must the life be reformed from
gross enormities, but the heart must have
undergone that change which the Gospel
points out. A competent knowledge of
God must be acquired. A proper found∣ation
must be laid in faith and repent∣ance,
for intercourse with Heaven.</P>
<P>They who would rush all at once from
the arms of the world, into the sacred
retreat of devotion; they who imagine
that retreat to stand always ready for the
reception of such as betake themselves to
it, for no reason, but because every other
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
refuge excludes them, betray gross igno∣rance
of this part of religion. They bring
to it, faculties unqualified to taste its plea∣sures;
and they grasp at hopes to which
they are not entitled. By incorporating
with devotion the unnatural mixture of
their unsanctified passions, they defile and
corrupt it. Hence, that gloom which has
often spread over it. Hence, those super∣stitious
mortifications and austerities, by
which the falsely devout hope to purchase
favour from God; haunted by the terrours
of a guilty conscience, and vainly strug∣gling
to substitute a servile and cringing
homage, in the room of the pure affec∣tions
of a renewed heart. On such altars,
the hallowed fire of true devotion cannot
burn; nor can any incense ascend from
them, that shall be grateful to Heaven.
<HI>Bring no more vain oblations. Wash ye, make
you clean, put away the evil of your doings
from before mine eyes, faith the Lord. Cease to
do evil; learn to do well.</HI> Then <HI>draw nigh
to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</HI>—
But though devotion requires a pure
<PB N="295" REF="304"/>
heart, and a virtuous life, and necessarily
supposes the exercise of frequent retire∣ment,
I must observe,</P>
<P>IN the third place, That it is an error
to conceive it as requiring an entire re∣treat
from the world. Devotion, like eve∣ry
other branch of religion, was intended
to fit us for discharging the duties of
life. We serve God, by being useful to
one another. It is evident from the frame
of our nature, and from our common ne∣cessities
and wants, that we were designed
by Providence for an active part on this
earth. The Gospel of Christ, accordingly,
considers us as engaged in the concerns
of the world; and directs its exhortations
to men in all the various relations, cha∣racters,
and employments of civil life.
Abstraction from society, therefore, and
total dedication of our time to devout ex∣ercises,
cannot be the most proper method
of acquiring the favour of God.</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to throw any
blame on those, who having lost all re∣lish
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
for the ordinary pursuits of life, in
consequence of great and severe wounds
which they have suffered from affliction;
who, feeling themselves standing alone,
and discerning their connections with
the world to be in some measure broken
off, choose to seek tranquillity in a religi∣ous
retirement, and to consecrate their
days entirely to God. Situations some∣times
occur, which both justify a great
degree of retreat from the world, and en∣title
it to respect. But, with regard to the
bulk of mankind, Christian devotion in∣fers
not, requires not, any such sequestra∣tion
from the affairs of men. Nay, for
the most part, it will be cultivated with
greater success by those who mingle it
with the active employments of life. For
the mind, when entirely occupied by any
one object, is in hazard of viewing it at
last through a false medium. Objects,
especially, so great and sublime as those
of devotion, when we attempt to fix upon
them unremitting attention, overstretch
and disorder our feeble powers. The
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
mind, by being relaxed, returns to them
with more advantage. As none of our
organs can bear intense <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsations, with∣out
injury; as the eye, when dazzled
with overpowering light, beholds ima∣ginary
colours, and loses the real di∣stinction
of objects; so the mind, when
over-heated by perpetual contemplation
of celestial things, has been sometimes
found to mistake the strong impressions
of fancy, for supernatural communica∣tions
from above. To the employments
of devotion, as to all other things, there
are due limits. There is a certain tem∣perate
sphere, within which, it preserves
longest its proper exertion, and most suc∣cessfully
promotes the purposes for which
it was designed.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, It is an error to
imagine, that devotion enjoins a total
contempt of all the pleasures and amuse∣ments
of human society. It checks, in∣deed,
that spirit of dissipation which is
too prevalent. It not only prohibits plea∣sures
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
which are unlawful, but likewise
that unlawful degree of attachment to
pleasures in themselves innocent, which
withdraws the attention of men from
what is serious and important. But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
brings amusement under due limitation,
without extirpating it. It forbids it, as
the business; but permits it, as the relaxa∣tion,
of life. For there is nothing in the
spirit of true religion, which is hostile to
a chearful enjoyment of our situation in
the world.</P>
<P>They who look with a severe and in∣dignant
eye, upon all the recreations by
which the cares of men are relieved, and
the union of society is cemented, are, in
two respects, injurious to religion. First,
they exhibit it to others under a for∣bidding
form, by cloathing it with the
garb of so much unnecessary austerity.
And, next, they deprive the world of
the benefit which their example might
afford, in drawing the line between in∣nocent
and dangerous pleasures. By a
temperate participation of those which
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
are innocent, they might successfully ex∣ert
that authority, which a virtuous and
respectable character always possesses, in
restraining undue excess. They would
show the young and unwary, at what
point they ought to stop. They would
have it in their power, to regulate, in
some degree, the publick manners; to
check extravagance, to humble presump∣tion,
and put vice to the blush. But,
through injudicious severity, they fall
short of the good they might perform.
By an indiscriminate censure of all a∣musement,
they detract from the weight
of their reproof, when amusement be∣comes
undoubtedly sinful. By totally
withdrawing themselves from the circle
of chearful life, they deliver up the en∣tertainments
of society into the hands of
the loose, and the corrupted; and permit
the blind power of fashion, uncontroul∣ed,
to establish its own standards, and
to exercise its dangerous sway over the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="309"/>
IN the fifth place, It is an error to
believe, that devotion nourishes a spirit
of severity, in judging of the manners
and characters of others. Under this re∣proach,
iudeed, it has so long suffered in
the world; that, with too many, the ap∣pellation
of devout, suggests no other cha∣racter,
but that of a four and recluse
bigot, who delights in censure. But the
reproach is unjust; for such a spirit is
entirely opposite to the nature of true de∣votion.
'I'he very first traces which it
imprints on the mind, are candour and
humility. Its principles are liberal. Its
genius is unassuming and mild. Severe
only to itself, it makes every allowance
for others which humanity can suggest.
It claims no privilege of looking into
their hearts, or of deciding with respect
to their eternal state.—If your supposed
devotion produce contrary effects; if it
infuse harshness into your sentiments,
and acrimony into your speech; you
may conclude, that, under a serious ap∣pearance,
carnal passions lurk. And, if
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
ever it shall so far lift you up with self∣conceit,
as to make you establish your
own opinions as an infallible standard
for the whole Christian world, and lead
you to consign to perdition all who differ
from you, either in some doctrinal tenets,
or in the mode of expressing them; you
may rest assured, that to much pride you
have joined much ignorance, both of the
nature of devotion, and of the Gospel of
Christ. Finally,</P>
<P>IN the sixth place, It is an error to
think, that perpetual rapture and spiritual
joy belong to devotion. Devout feelings
admit very different degrees of warmth
and exaltation. Some persons, by the
frame of their minds, are much more
susceptible than others, of the tender
emotions. They more readily relent at
the view of Divine goodness, glow with
a warmer ardour of love, and, by conse∣quence,
rise to a higher elevation of joy
and hope. But in the midst of still and
calm affections, devotion often dwells;
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
and though it produce no transports in
the mind, diffuses over it a steady sere∣nity.
Devout sensations not only vary
in their degree, according to the frame
of different tempers; but, even among
the best disposed, suffer much interrup∣tion
and decay. It were too much to
expect, that in the present state of human
frailty, those happy feelings should be
uniform and constant. Oppression of
worldly cares, languor of spirits, and
infirmities of bodily health, frequently
indispose us for the enjoyment of devout
affections. Pious men, on these occasions,
are in hazard of passing judgment on
their own state with too much severity;
as if, for some great iniquity, they were
condemned by God to final hardness of
heart. Hence arises that melancholy,
which has been seen to overcloud them;
and which has given occasion to many
contemptuous scoffs of ungodly men. But
it is a melancholy which deserves to be
treated with tenderness, not with con∣tempt.
It is the excess of virtuous and
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
pious sensibility. It is the overflowing of
a heart affected, in an extreme degree,
with the humble sense of its own failings,
and with ardent concern to attain the fa∣vour
of God. A weakness, however, we
admit it to be, though not a crime; and
hold it to be perfectly separable from
the essence of devotion. For contrition,
though it may melt, ought not to sink
or overpower, the heart of a Christian.
The tear of repentance leads to its own
relief. Religion is a spring of consola∣tion,
not of terrour, to every well inform∣ed
mind, which, in a proper manner, rests
its hope on the infinite goodness of God,
and the all-sufficient merit of Christ.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us remove from devo∣tion
all those mistakes, to which the cor∣ruptions
of men, or their ignorance and
prejudices, have given rise. With us, let
it be the worship of God <HI>in spirit and in
truth;</HI> the elevation of the soul towards
him, in simplicity and love. Let us pursue
it is the principle of virtuous conduct, and
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
of inward peace. By frequent and serious
meditation on the great objects of reli∣gion,
let us lay ourselves open to its in∣fluence.
By means of the institutions of
the Gospel, let us cherish its impressions.
And, above all, let us pray to God, that
he may establish its power in our heart.
For here, if any where, his assistance is
requisite. The spirit of devotion is his
gift. From his inspiration it proceeds.
Towards him it tends; and in his pre∣sence
hereafter, it shall attain its full per∣fection.</P>

<BIBL>TITUS ii. 6.</BIBL>
<Q>Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOBRIETY of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> is one of those
virtues: which the present condition
of human life strongly inculcates. The
uncertainty of its enjoyments, checks pre∣sumption;
the multiplicity of its dangers,
demands perpetual caution. Moderation,
vigilance, and self-government, are duties
incumbent on all; but especially, on such
as are beginning the journey of life.
To them, therefore, the admonition in
the Text is, with great propriety, direct∣ed;
though there is reason to fear, that
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
by them it is in hazard of being least
regarded. Experience enforces the ad∣monition
on the most giddy, after they
have advanced in years. But the whole
state of youthful views and passions, is
adverse to sobriety of mind. The scenes
which present themselves, at our entering
upon the world, are commonly flattering.
Whatever they be in themselves, the lively
spirits of the young gild every opening
prospect. The field of hope appears to
stretch wide before them. Pleasure seems
to put forth its blossoms on every side.
Impelled by desire, forward they rush
with inconsiderate ardour: Prompt to
decide, and to choose; averse to hesitate,
or to enquire; credulous, because un∣taught
by experience; rash, because un∣acquainted
with danger; head-strong,
because unsubdued by disappointment.
Hence arise the perils, of which it is my
design at present to warn them. I shall
take <HI>sobriety of mind,</HI> in its most compre∣hensive
sense, as including the whole of
that discipline which religion and virtue
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
prescribe to youth. Though the words
of the Text are directly addressed to <HI>young
men,</HI> yet, as the same admonition is given
in a preceeding verse to the other sex, the
instructions which arise from the Text, are
to be considered as common to both. I
intend, first, to show them the importance
of beginning early to give serious atten∣tion
to their conduct; and, next, to point
out those virtues which they ought chief∣ly
to cultivate.</P>
<P>As soon as you are capable of reflec∣tion,
you must perceive that there is a
right and a wrong, in human actions.
You see, that those who are born with
the same advantages of fortune, are not
all equally prosperous in the course of life.
While some of them, by wise and steady
conduct, attain distinction in the world,
and pass their days with comfort and ho∣nour;
others of the same rank, by mean
and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advan∣tages
of their birth, involve, themselves in
much misery, and end in being a dis∣grace
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
to their friends, and a burden on
society. Early, then, you may learn, that
it is not on the external condition, in
which you find yourselves placed, but on
the part which you are to act, that your
welfare or unhappiness, your honour or
infamy, depend. Now, when beginning
to act that part, what can be of greater
moment, than to regulate your plan of
conduct with the most serious attention,
before you have yet committed any fatal
or irretrievable errors? If, instead of ex∣erting
reflection for this valuable pur∣pose,
you deliver yourselves up, at so cri∣tical
a time, to sloth and pleasure; if you
refuse to listen to any counsellour but
humour, or to attend to any pursuit, ex∣cept
that of amusement; if you allow
yourselves to float loose and careless on
the tide of life, ready to receive any di∣rection
which the current of fashion may
chance to give you; what can you expect
to follow, from such beginnings? While
so many around you are undergoing the
sad consequences of a like indiscretion,
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
for what reason shall not those conse∣quences
extend to you? Shall you only
attain success without that preparation,
and escape dangers without that precau∣tion,
which is required of others? Shall
happiness grow up to you, of its own ac∣cord,
and sollicit your acceptance, when,
to the rest of mankind, it is the fruit of
long cultivation, and the acquisition of
labour and care?—Deceive not your∣selves
with such arrogant hopes. What∣ever
be your rank, Providence will not,
for your sake, reverse its established or∣der.
The Author of your being hath en∣joined
you to <HI>take heed to your ways; to
ponder the paths of your feet; to remember
your Creator in the days of your youth.</HI> He
hath decreed, that they only <HI>who seek af∣ter
wisdom shall find it; that fools shall
be afflicted, because of their transgressions;</HI>
and that <HI>whoso refuseth instruction, shall
destroy his own soul.</HI> By listening to these
admonitions, and tempering the vivacity
of youth with a proper mixture of ferious
thought, you may ensure chearfulness for
<PB N="310" REF="319"/>
the rest of life; but by delivering your∣selves
up at present to giddiness and le∣vity,
you lay the foundation of lasting
heaviness of heart.</P>
<P>When you look forward to those plans
of life, which either your circumstances
have suggested, or your friends have pro∣posed,
you will not hesitate to acknow∣ledge,
that in order to pursue them with
advantage, some previous discipline is re∣quisite.
Be assured, that whatever is to
be your profession, no education is more
necessary to your success, than the ac∣quirement
of virtuous dispositions and
habits. This is the universal preparation
for every character, and every station
in life. Bad as the world is, respect is
always paid to virtue. In the usual course
of human affairs, it will be found, that
a plain understanding joined with ac∣knowledged
worth, contributes more to
prosperity, than the brightest parts with∣out
probity or honour. Whether science,
or business, or publick life, be your aim,
virtue still enters, for a principal share, in∣to
<PB N="311" REF="320"/>
to all those great departments of human
action. It is connected with eminence
in every liberal art; with reputation in
every branch of fair and useful business;
with distinction in every publick station.
The vigour which it gives the mind, and
the weight which it adds to character;
the generous sentiments which it breathes,
the undaunted spirit which it inspires,
the ardour of diligence which it quickens,
the freedom which it procures from per∣nicious
and dishonourable avocations, are
the foundations of all that is high in fame,
or great in success, among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging en∣dowments
you now possess, virtue is a
necessary requisite, in order to their shin∣ing
with proper lustre. Feeble are the
attractions of the fairest form, if it be
suspected that nothing within, corresponds
to the pleasing appearance without. Short
are the triumphs of wit, when it is sup∣posed
to be the vehicle of malice. By
whatever arts you may at first attract the
attention, you can hold the esteem, and
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
secure the hearts of others, only by ami∣able
dispositions, and the improvements of
the mind. These are the qualities whose
influence will last, when the lustre of all
that once sparkled and dazzled, has passed
away.</P>
<P>Let not then the season of youth be
barren of improvements, so essential to
your future felicity and honour. Now is
the seed-time of life; and according to
<HI>what you sow, you shall reap.</HI> Your cha∣racter
is now, under divine assistance, of
your own forming; your fate is, in some
measure, put into your own hands. Your
nature is as yet pliant and soft. Habits
have not established their dominion. Pre∣judices
have not pre-occupied your un∣derstanding.
The world has not had time
to contract and debase your affections.
All your powers are more vigorous, dis∣embarassed
and free, than they will be
at any future period. Whatever impulse
you now give to your desires and passions,
the direction is likely to continue. It
will form the channel in which your life
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>
is to run; nay, it may determine its ever∣lasting
issue. Consider then the employ∣ment
of this important period, as the
highest trust which shall ever be com∣mitted
to you; as, in a great measure,
decisive of your happiness, in time and
in eternity. As in the succession of the
seasons, each, by the invariable laws of
Nature, affects the productions of what
is next in course; so, in human life, every
period of our age, according as it is well
or ill spent, influences the happiness of
that which is to follow. Virtuous youth
gradually brings forward accomplished
and flourishing manhood; and such man∣hood
passes of itself, without uneasiness,
into respectable and tranquil old age.
But when nature is turned out of its re∣gular
course, disorder takes place in the
moral, just as in the vegetable world. If
the Spring put forth no blossoms, in
Summer there will be no beauty, and
in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be
trifled away without improvement, man∣hood
will be contemptible, and old age
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
miserable. If the beginnings of life have
been <HI>vanity,</HI> its latter end can be no other
than <HI>vexation of spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus shown the importance of
beginning early to give serious attention
to conduct, I come, next, to point out the
virtues which are most necessary to be cul∣tivated
in youth. What I shall,</P>
<P>I. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. With
this I begin, both as the foundation of
good morals, and as a disposition particu∣larly
graceful and becoming in youth. To
be void of it, argues a cold heart, destitute
of some of the best affections which belong
to that age. Youth is the season of warm
and generous emotions. The heart should
then, spontaneously, rise into the admira∣tion
of what is great, glow with the love
of what is fair and excellent, and melt at
the discovery of tenderness and goodness.
Where can any object be found so proper
to kindle those affections, as the Father of
the universe, and the Author of all feli∣city?
Unmoved by veneration, can you
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
contemplate that grandeur and majesty,
which his works every where display?
Untouched by gratitude, can you view
that profusion of good, which, in this
pleasing season of life, his beneficent hand
pours around you? Happy in the love
and affection of those with whom you
are connected, look up to the Supreme
Being, as the inspirer of all the friend∣ship
which has ever been shown you by
others; himself, your best and most an∣tient
friend; formerly, the supporter of
your infancy, and the guide of your
childhood; now, the guardian of your
youth, and the hope of your coming
years. View religious homage, as a na∣tural
expression of gratitude to him for
all his goodness. Consider it as the ser∣vice
of the <HI>God of your fathers;</HI> of him,
to whom your parents devoted you; of
him, whom in former ages your ancestors
honoured; and by whom they are now
rewarded, and blessed in heaven. Con∣nected
with so many tender sensibilities
of soul, let religion be with you, not the
<PB N="316" REF="325"/>
cold and barren offspring of speculation,
but the warm and vigorous dictate of the
heart.</P>
<P>But though piety chiefly belong to the
heart, yet the aid of the understanding is
requisite, to give a proper direction to the
devout affections. You must endeavour,
therefore, to acquire just views, both of
the great principles of natural religion,
and of the peculiar doctrines of the gospel.
For this end, study the sacred scriptures.
Consult the word of God, more than the
systems of men, if you would know the
truth in its native purity. When, upon
rational and sober enquiry, you have esta∣blished
your principles, suffer them not
to be shaken, by the scoffs of the licen∣tious,
or the cavils of the sceptical. Re∣member,
that in the examination of eve∣ry
great and comprehensive plan, such as
that of Christianity, difficulties may be ex∣pected
to occur; and that reasonable evi∣dence
is not to be rejected, because the na∣ture
of our present state allows us only to
<HI>know in part, and to see through a glass darkly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326"/>
Impress your minds with reverence for
all that is sacred. Let no wantonness of
youthful spirits, no compliance with the
intemperate mirth of others, ever betray
you into sallies of profanity. Besides the
guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing
gives a more odious appearance of petu∣lance
and presumption to youth, than the
affectation of treating religion with levi∣ty.
Instead of being an evidence of su∣periour
understanding, it betrays a pert
and shallow mind; which, vain of the
first smatterings of knowledge, presumes
to make light of what the rest of mankind
revere.</P>
<P>At the same time, you are not to ima∣gine,
that when exhorted to be religious,
you are called upon, to become more for∣mal
and solemn in your manners than
others of the same years, or to erect your∣selves
into supercilious reprovers of those
around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It gives
a native, unaffected ease to the behaviour.
It is social, kind, and chearful; far re∣moved
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
from that gloomy and illiberal su∣perstition
which clouds the brow, sharpens
the temper, dejects the spirit, and teaches
men to fit themselves for another world,
by neglecting the concerns of this. Let
your religion, on the contrary, connect
preparation for heaven, with an honour∣able
discharge of the duties of active life.
Let it be associated in your imagination,
with all that is manly and useful; with
<HI>whatsoever things are true, are just, are
pure, are lovely, are of good report;</HI> where∣ever
there is <HI>any virtue,</HI> and wherever there
is <HI>any praise.</HI> Of such religion discover,
on every proper occasion, that you are not
ashamed; but avoid making any unnecces∣sary
oftentation of it before the world.</P>
<P>II. To piety, join modesty and docility,
reverence of your parents, and submission
to those who are your superiours in know∣ledge,
in station, and in years. Depend∣ance
and obedience belong to youth.
Modesty is one of its chief ornaments;
and has ever been esteemed a presage of
<PB N="319" REF="328"/>
rising merit. When entering on the ca∣reer
of life, it is your part, not to assume
the reins as yet into your hands, but to
commit yourselves to the guidance of the
more experienced; and to become wise by
the wisdom of those who have gone be∣fore
you.</P>
<P>Of all the follies incident to youth,
there are none which either deform its
present appearance, or blast the prospect
of its future prosperity, more than self∣conceit,
presumption, and obstinacy. By
checking its natural progress in improve∣ment,
they fix it in long immaturity;
and frequently produce mischiefs, which
can never be repaired. Yet these are vices
too commonly found among the young.
Big with enterprise, and elated by hope,
they resolve to trust for success to none
but themselves. Full of their own abili∣ties,
they deride the admonitions which
are given them by their friends, as the
timorous suggestions of age. Too wise
to learn, too impatient to deliberate, too
forward to be restrained, they plunge,
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
with precipitant indiscretion, into the
midst of all the dangers with which 1ife
abounds. <HI>Seest thou a</HI> young <HI>man wise in
his own conceit? There is more hope of a
fool, than of him.</HI>—Positive as you now
are in your opinions, and confident in
your assertions, be assured, that the time
approaches, when both men and things
will appear to you in a different light.
Many characters which you now admire,
will, by and by, sink in your esteem; and
many opinions, of which you are at pre∣sent
most tenacious, will alter with ad∣vancing
years. Distrust, therefore, that
glare of youthful presumption, which
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your
own sense. Put not yourselves forward
with too much eagerness; nor imagine,
that by the impetuosity of juvenile ar∣dour,
you can overturn systems which
have been long established, and change
the face of the world. <HI>Learn not to think
more highly of yourselves than you ought to
think, but to think soberly.</HI> By patient and
gradual progression in improvement, you
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
may, in due time, command lasting esteem.
But by assuming, at present, a tone of su∣periority,
to which you have no title, you
will disgust those whose approbation it is
most important to gain. Forward viva∣city
may fit you to be the companions of
an idle hour. More solid qualities must
recommend you to the wise, and mark
you out for importance and considera∣tion,
in subsequent life.</P>
<P>III. IT is necessary to recommend to
you, sincerity and truth. This is the basis
of every virtue. That darkness of charac∣ter,
where we can see no heart; those fold∣ings
of art, through which no native af∣fection
is allowed to penetrate, present an
object, unamiable in every season of life,
but particularly odious in youth. If at
an age, when the heart is warm, when the
emotions are strong, and when nature is
expected to show itself free and open, you
can already smile and deceive, what are
we to look for, when you shall be longer
hackneyed in the ways of men; when
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
interest shall have compleated the obdu∣ration
of your heart, and experience shall
have improved you in all the arts of guile?
Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner
of perfidy in old age. Its first appearance
is the fatal omen of growing depravity,
and future shame. It degrades parts and
learning; obscures the lustre of every ac∣complishment;
and sinks you into con∣tempt
with God, and man.</P>
<P>As you value, therefore, the approba∣tion
of Heaven, or the esteem of the world,
cultivate the love of truth. In all your pro∣ceedings,
be direct and consistent. Inge∣nuity
and candour possess the most power∣ful
charm; they bespeak universal savour,
and carry an apology almost for every
failing. <HI>The lip of truth, shall be established
for ever; but a lying tongue, is but for a mo∣ment.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 19.</NOTE>
The path of truth, is a plain and
a safe path; that of falsehood, is a per∣plexing
miaze. After the first departure
from sincerity, it is not in your power to
stop. One artifice unavoidably leads on
to another; till, as the intricacy of the
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
labyrinth thickens, you are left entangled
in your own snare. Deceit discovers a lit∣tle
mind, which stops at temporary expe∣dients,
without rising to comprehensive
views of conduct. It betrays, at the same
time, a dastardly spirit. It is the resource
of one, who wants courage to avow his
designs, or to rest upon himself. Whereas,
openness of character displays that gene∣rous
boldness, which ought to distinguish
youth. To set out in the world with no
other principle than a crafty attention to
interest, betokens one who is destined for
creeping through the inferiour walks of
life. But to give an early preference to
honour above gain, when they stand in
competition; to despise every advantage,
which cannot be attained without dis∣honest
arts; to brook no meanness, and
to stoop to no dissimulation; are the in∣dications
of a great mind, the prefages of
future eminence and distinction in life.</P>
<P>At the same time, this virtuous since∣rity
is perfectly consistent with the most
prudent vigilance and caution. It is op∣posed
<PB N="324" REF="333"/>
to cunning, not to true wisdom.
It is not the simplicity of a weak and im∣provident,
but the candour of an enlarged
and noble mind; of one, who scorns de∣ceit,
because he accounts it both base and
unprofitable; and who seeks no disguise,
because he needs none to hide him. <HI>Lord!
Who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall
ascend into thy holy hill? He that walketh
uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
speaketh the truth in his heart.</HI></P>
<P>IV. YOUTH is the proper season of
cultivating the benevolent, and humane
affections. As a great part of your hap∣piness
is to depend on the connections
which you form with others, it is of high
importance that you acquire, betimes, the
temper and the manners which will ren∣der
such connections comfortable. Let a
sense of justice be the foundation of all
your social qualities. In your most early
intercourse with the world, and even in
your youthful amusements, let no unfair∣ness
be found. Engrave on your mind
<PB N="325" REF="334"/>
that sacred rule, of <HI>doing in all things to
others, according as you wish that they
should do unto you.</HI> For this end, impress
yourselves with a deep sense of the origi∣nal,
and natural, equality of men. What∣ever
advantages of birth or fortune you
possess, never display them with an often∣tatious
superiority. Leave the subordi∣nations
of rank, to regulate the intercourse
of more advanced years. At present, it
becomes you to act among your compa∣nions,
as man with man. Remember how
unknown to you are the vicissitudes of
the world; and how often they, on whom
ignorant and contemptuous young men
once looked down with scorn, have risen
to be their superiours in future years.</P>
<P>Compassion is an emotion, of which
you ought never to be ashamed. Grace∣ful
in youth is the tear of sympathy, and
the heart that melts at the tale of woe.
Let not ease and indulgence contract your
affections, and wrap you up in selfish en∣joyment.
But go sometimes to the <HI>house of mourning?</HI> as well as <HI>to the house of feast∣ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="335"/>
Accustom yourselves to think of the
distresses of human life; of the solitary
cottage, the dying parent, and the weep∣ing
orphan. <HI>Thou shall not harden thy
heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor bro∣ther;
but thou shall surely give unto him in
the day of his need: And thine heart shall
not be grieved when thou givest unto him,
because that for this thing, the Lord thy God
shall bless thee in all thy works.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Deut. xv. 7, 10.</NOTE>
Never sport with pain and distress, in any of
your amusements; nor treat even the
meanest infect, with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>In young minds, there is common∣ly
a strong propensity to particular in∣timacies
and friendships. Youth, in∣deed,
is the season when friendship are
sometimes formed, which not only con∣tinue
through succeeding life, but which
glow to the last, with a tenderness un∣known
to the connections begun in cooler
years. The propensity therefore is not to
be discouraged; though at the same time it
must be regulated with much circumspec∣tion
and care. Too many of the pretended
<PB N="327" REF="336"/>
friendships of youth, are mere combina∣tions
in pleasure. Often they are found∣ed
on capricious likings; suddenly con∣tracted,
and as suddenly dissolved. Some∣times
they are the effect of interested com∣plaisance
and flattery on the one side, and
of credulous fondness on the other. Beware
of such rash and dangerous connections,
which may afterwards load you with dis∣honour.
Remember, that by the charac∣ter
of those whom you choose for your
friends, your own is likely to be formed,
and will certainly be judged of by the
world. Be slow, therefore, and cautious
in contracting intimacy; but when a vir∣tuous
friendship is once established, con∣sider
it as a sacred engagement. Expose
not yourselves to the reproach of lightness
and inconstancy, which always bespeak,
either a trifling, or a base mind. Reveal
none of the secrets of your friend. Be
faithful to his interests. Forsake him not
in danger. Abhor the thought of ac∣quiring
any advantage by his prejudice
or hurt. <HI>There is a friend that loveth at
<PB N="328" REF="337"/>
all times, and a brother that is born for ad∣versity.
Thine own friend, and thy father's
Friend, forsake not</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 17.—xxvii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Finally, on this head; in order to ren∣der
yourselves amiable in society, subdue
all harshness of behaviour. Let that cour∣tesy
appear in your demeanour, which
springs not so much from studied polite∣ness,
as from a mild and gentle heart.
Follow the customs of the world in mat∣ters
indifferent; but stop when they be∣come
sinful. Let your manners be sim∣ple
and natural; and of course they will
be engaging. Affectation is certain de∣formity.
By forming themselves on fan∣tastick
models, and vying with one ano∣ther
in every reigning folly, the young
begin with being ridiculous, and end in
being vitious and immoral.</P>
<P>V. LET me particularly exhort youth,
to temperance in pleasure: Let me admo∣nish
them, to beware of that rock on which
thousands, from race to race, continue to
split. The love of pleasure, natural to
<PB N="329" REF="338"/>
man in every period of his life, glows at
this age with excessive ardour. Novelty
adds fresh charms, as yet, to every grati∣fication.
The world appears to spread a
continual feast; and health, vigour, and
high spirits, invite them to partake of it
without restraint. In vain we warn them
of latent dangers. Religion is accused of
insufferable severity, in precluding enjoy∣ment;
and the old, when they offer their
admonitions, are upbraided with having
forgot that they once were young.—And
yet, my friends, to what do the restraints
of religion, and the counsels of age, with
respect to pleasure, amount? They may
all be comprized in two words, not to
hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others,
by your pursuit of pleasure. Within these
bounds, pleasure is lawful; beyond them,
it becomes criminal, because it is ruinous.
Are these restraints any other, than what
a wise man would choose to impose on
himself? We call you not to renounce
pleasure, but to enjoy it in safety. In∣stead
of abridging it, we exhort you to
<PB N="330" REF="339"/>
pursue it on an extensive plan. We pro∣pose
measures for securing its possession,
and prolonging its duration.</P>
<P>Consult your whole nature. Consider
yourselves not only as sensitive, but as
rational beings; not only as rational, but
social; not only as social, but immortal.
Whatever violates your nature in any of
these respects, cannot afford true pleasure;
any more than that can promote health,
which undermines an essential part of the
vital system. For the truth of this con∣clusion,
we appeal not merely to the au∣thority
of religion, nor to the testimony
of the aged, but to yourselves, and your
own experience. We ask, Whether you
have not found, that in a course of cri∣minal
excess, your pleasure was more
than compensated by succeeding pain;
Whether, if not from every particular
instance, yet from every habit, at least,
of unlawful gratification, there did not
spring some thorn to wound you, there
did not arise some consequence to make
you repent of it in the issue? <HI>How long
<PB N="331" REF="340"/>
then, ye simple ones! will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> simplicity?</HI>
How long repeat the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of per∣nicious
folly, and tamely expose your∣selves
to be caught in the same snare? If
you have any consideration, or any firm∣ness
left, avoid temptations, for which you
have found yourselves unequal, with as
much care, as you would shun pestilential
infection. Break off all connections with
the loose and prosligate. <HI>When sinners entice
thee, consent thou not. Look not on the wine
when it is red, when it giveth its colour in
the cup; for at the last, it biteth like a ser∣pent,
and stingeth like an adder. Remove
thy way from the strange woman, and come
not nigh the door of her house. Let not thine
heart decline to her ways; for her house is
the way to hell. Thou goest after her as a
bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
that it is for his life.</HI></P>
<P>How many amiable and promising qua∣lities
in youth, are extinguished by the un∣happy
excesses of irregular pleasure! How
many flattering hopes of parents, and
friends, are cruelly destroyed! Who but
<PB N="332" REF="341"/>
must drop <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over the ruins of human
nature, when he beholds that morning
which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bright, setting in such
untimely darkness; that good humour
which once captivated all hearts, that vi∣vacity
which sparkled in every company,
those abilities which were fitted for shin∣ing
in the highest station, all sacrificed at
the shrine of low sensuality; and one who
was formed for running the fair career of
life in the midst of public esteem, cut off
by his vices at the beginning of his
course, or sunk, for the whole of it, in∣to
insignificancy and contempt!—These,
O sinful Pleasure! are thy trophies. It
is thus, that, co-operating with the foe of
God and man, thou degradest human ho∣nour,
and blastest the opening prospects
of human felicity.</P>
<P>VI. DILIGENCE, industry, and proper
improvement of time, are material duties
of the young. To no purpose are they
endowed with the best abilities, if they
want activity for exerting them. Un∣availing,
<PB N="333" REF="342"/>
in this case, will be every direc∣tion
that can be given them, either for
their temporal or spiritual welfare. In
youth, the habits of industry are most
easily acquired. In youth, the incentives
to it are strongest, from ambition and from
duty, from emulation and hope, from all
the prospects which the beginning of
life affords. If, dead to these calls, you
already languish in slothful inaction,
what will be able to quicken the more
sluggish current of advancing years?</P>
<P>Industry is not only the instrument of
improvement, but the foundation of plea∣sure.
Nothing is so opposite to the true
enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and
feeble state of an indolent mind. He
who is a stranger to industry, may possess,
but he cannot enjoy. For it is labour
only which gives the relish to pleasure.
It is the appointed vehicle of every good
to man. It is the indispensible condition
of our possessing a sound mind, in a sound
body. Sloth is so inconsistent with both,
that it is hard to determine whether it be
<PB N="334" REF="343"/>
a greater foe to virtue, or to health and
happiness. Inactive as it is in itself, it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
effects are fatally powerful. Though it
appear a slowly flowing stream, yet it un∣dermines
all that is stable and flourishing.
It not only saps the foundation of every
Virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of
crimes and evils. It is like water which
first putrifies by stagnation; and then
sends up noxious vapours, and fills the
atmosphere with death.</P>
<P>Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the
certain parent both of guilt and of ruin.
And under idleness I include, not mere
Inaction only, but all that circle of trisl∣ing
occupations, in which too many
saunter away their youth; perpetually
engaged in frivolous society, or public
amusements, in the labours of dress, or
the ostentation of their person.—Is this
the foundation which you lay for future
usefulness and esteem? By such accom∣plishments,
do you hope to recommend
yourselves to the thinking part of the
world, and to answer the expectations of
<PB N="335" REF="344"/>
your friends, and your country?—A∣musements,
youth requires. It were vain,
it were cruel, to prohibit them. But
though allowable as the relaxation, they
are most culpable as the business, of the
young. For, they then become the gulf
of time, and the poison of the mind. They
foment bad passions. They weaken the
manly powers. They sink the native vigour
of youth into contemptible effeminacy.</P>
<P>Redeeming your time from such dan∣gerous
waste, seek to fill it with em∣ployments
which you may review with
satisfaction. The acquisition of know∣ledge,
is one of the most honourable occu∣pations
of youth. The desire of it, dis∣covers
a liberal mind, and is connected with many accomplishments, and many
virtues. But though your train of life
should not lead you to study, the course
of education always furnishes proper
employments to a well-disposed mind.
Whatever you pursue, be emulous to ex∣cell.
Generous ambition, and sensibility to
praise, are, especially at your age, among
<PB N="336" REF="345"/>
the marks of virtue. Think not, that
any affluence of fortune, or any elevation
of rank, exempts you from the duties of
application and industry. Industry is the
law of our being; it is the demand of Na∣ture,
of Reason, and of God. Remember
always, that the years which now pass
over your heads, leave permanent memo∣rials
behind them. From your thought∣less
minds they may escape; but they re∣main
in the remembrance of God. They
form an important part of the register of
your life. They will hereafter bear testi∣mony,
either for or against you, at that
day, when, for all your actions, but par∣ticularly
for the employments of youth,
you must give an account to God.</P>
<P>THUS I have set before you, some of
the chief qualifications which belong to
that <HI>sober mind,</HI> that virtuous and religi∣ous
character, which the Apostle in my
Text recommends to youth; piety, mo∣desty,
truth, benevolence, temperance, and
industry. Whether your future course is
<PB N="337" REF="346"/>
destined to be long or short, after this
manner it should commence; and, if it
continue to be thus conducted, its con∣clusion,
at what time soever it arrives,
will not be inglorious or unhappy. For,
<HI>honourable age it not that which standeth in
length of time, or that which is measured by
number of years. But wisdom is the gray
hair to man, and an unspotted life is old age.</HI></P>
<P>LET me finish the subject, with recalling
your attention to that dependance on the
blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your
endeavours after improvement, you ought
continually to preferve. It is too common
with the young, even when they resolve
to tread the path of virtue and honour, to
set out with presumptuous confidence in
themselves. Trusting to their own abilities
for carrying them successfully through life,
they are careless of applying to God,
or of deriving any assistance, from what
they are apt to reckon the gloomy disci∣pline
of religion. Alas! how little do they
know the dangers which await them?
<PB N="338" REF="347"/>
Neither human wisdom, nor human vir∣true,
unsupported by religion, are equal
for the trying situations which often occur
in life. By the shock of temptation, how
frequently have the most virtuous inten∣tions
been overthrown? Under the pres∣sure
of disaster, how often has the greatest
constancy sunk? <HI>Every good, and every
perfect gift, is from above.</HI> Wisdom and
virtue, as well as <HI>riches and honour, come
from God.</HI> Destitute of his favour, you
are in no better situation, with all your
boasted abilities, than orphans left to wan∣der
in a tractless desert, without any guide
to conduct them, or any shelter to cover
them from the gathering storm. Correct,
then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect
not, that your happiness can be indepen∣dent
of him who made you. By faith
and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of
the world. By piety and prayer, seek the

which guides our steps, varies with the
progress of the day, so the rule of reli∣gious
conduct is diversified in its appli∣cation,
by the different stages of our pre∣sent
existence. To every age, there be∣longs
a distinct propriety of behaviour.
There arises from it, a series of duties pe∣culiar
to itself.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="350"/>
Of those which are incumbent on youth,
I have treated in the preceeding discourse.
As we advance from youth to middle age,
a new field of action opens, and a diffe∣rent
character is required. The flow of
gay and impetuous spirits, begins to sub∣side.
Life gradually assumes a graver cast;
the mind, a more sedate and thoughtful
turn. The attention is now transferred
from pleasure to interest; that is, to plea∣sure
diffused over a wider extent, and
measured by a larger scale. Formerly,
the enjoyment of the present moment
occupied the whole attention. Now, no
action terminates ultimately in itself, but
refers to some more distant aim. Wealth
and power, the instruments of lasting
gratification, are now coveted more than
any single pleasure. Prudence and fore∣sight
lay their plans. Industry carries
on its patient efforts. Activity pushes
forward; address winds around. Here,
an enemy is to be overcome; there, a ri∣val
to be displaced. Competitions warm;
and the strife of the world thickens on
<PB N="342" REF="351"/>
every side. To guide men through this
busy period, without loss of integrity; to
guard them against the temptations which
arise from mistakcn, or interfering, inter∣ests;
to recall them, from worldly pur∣suits,
to serious thoughts of their spiritual
concerns, is the great office of religion.</P>
<P>But as this includes, in a great mea∣sure,
the whole compass of moral duty;
as the general strain of religious exhorta∣tion,
is addressed to those who are in this
season of life; a delineation of the virtues,
properly belonging to middle age, may ap∣pear
unnecessary, and would lead us into
too wide a field. Let us therefore turn
our view to a bounded prospect; and
contemplate a period of life, the duties of
which are circumscribed within narrower
limits. Old age is a stage of the human
course, which every one hopes to reach;
and therefore the consideration of it, in∣terests
us all. It is a period justly entitled
to general respect. Even its failings ought
to be touched with a gentle hand; and
though the petulant, and the vain, may
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
despise <HI>the hoary head</HI> yet the wisest of
men has asserted in the Text, that when
<HI>found in the way of righteousness, it is a
crown of glory.</HI> I shall, first, offer some
counsels, concerning the errors which are
most incident to the aged. Secondly, I
shall suggest the peculiar duties they
ought to practise; and, thirdly, Point out
the consolations they may enjoy.</P>
<P>I. As the follies and vices of youth,
are chiefly derived from inexperience and
presumption; so, almost all the errors of
age, may be traced up to the feebleness
and distress peculiar to that time of life.
Though, in every part of life, vexations
occur; yet, in former years, either business,
or pleasure, served to obliterate their im∣pression,
by supplying occupation to the
mind. Old age begins its advances, with
disqualifying men for relishing the one,
and for taking an active part in the other.
While it withdraws their accustomed sup∣ports,
it imposes, at the same time, the ad∣ditional
burden of growing infirmities. In
<PB N="344" REF="353"/>
the former stages of their journey, hope
continued to flatter them with many a
fair and enticing prospect. But in pro∣portion
as old age increases, those pleasing
illusions vanish. Life is contracted with∣in
a narrow and barren circle. Year after
year, steals somewhat away from their
store of comfort; deprives them of some
of their ancient friends, blunts some of
their powers of sensation, or incapacitates
them for some function of life.</P>
<P>Though, in the plan of Providence, it
is wisely ordered, that before we are
called away from the world, our attach∣ment
to it should be gradually loosened;
though it be fit in itself, that as in the
day of human life, there is a morning
and a noon, so there should be an evening
also, when the lengthening shadows shall
admonish us of approaching night; yet
we have no reason to be surprized, if they
who are arrived at this dejecting season,
feel and lament the change which they
suffer. The complaints therefore of. the
aged, should meet with tenderness, rather
<PB N="345" REF="354"/>
than censure. The burden under which
they labour ought to be viewed with
sympathy, by those who must bear it in
their turn, and who perhaps, hereafter,
may complain of it as bitterly. At the
same time, the old should consider, that all
the seasons of life have their several trials
allotted to them; and that to bear the in∣firmities
of age with becoming patience,
is as much their duty, as it is that of the
young to resist the temptations of youth∣ful
pleasure. By calmly enduring, for the
short time that remains, what Providence
is pleased to inflict, they both express a
resignation most acceptable to God, and
recommend themselves to the esteem and
assistance of all who are around them.</P>
<P>But though the querulous temper im∣puted
to old age, is to be considered as a
natural infirmity, rather than as a vice;
the same apology cannot be made for that
peevish disgust at the manners, and that
malignant censure of the enjoyments of
the young, which is sometimes found to
accompany advancing years. Nothing
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
can be more unjust, than to take off∣ence
at others, on account of their partaking
of pleasures, which it is past your time to
enjoy. By indulging this fretful temper,
you both aggravate the uneasiness of age,
and you alienate those on whole affection
much of your comfort depends. In order
to make the two extremes of life unite in
amicable society, it is greatly to be wish∣ed,
that the young would look forward,
and consider that they shall one day be
old; and that the old would look back,
and remembering that they once were
young, make proper allowances for the
temper and the manners of youth.</P>
<P>But instead of this, it is too common
to find the aged, at declared enmity with
every thing that is present; perpetually
complaining of the growing depravity of
the world, and of the astonishing vices
and follies of the rising generation. All
things, according to them, are rushing
fast into ruin. Decency and good order
have become extinct, ever since that hap∣py
discipline, under which they spent
<PB N="347" REF="356"/>
their youth, has passed away.—Part, at
least, of this displeasure, you may fairly
impute to the infirmity of age, which
throws its own gloom on every surround∣ing
object. Similar lamentations were, in
the days of your youth, poured, forth by
your fathers; and they who are now
young, shall, when it comes to their turn,
inveigh, in the like strain, against those
who succeed them. Great has been the
corruption of the world in every age.
Sufficient ground there is for the com∣plaints
made by serious observers, at all
times, of abounding iniquity and folly.
But though particular modes of vice pre∣vail
in one age, more than in others, it
does not follow, that on that age all ini∣quity
is accumulated. It is the form▪
perhaps, more than the quantity of cor∣ruption,
which makes the distinction. In
the worst of times, God has as sured us,
that there shall be always <HI>a seed who shall
serve him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxii. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Say not thou, What is the cause
that the former days were better than these?
<PB N="348" REF="357"/>
for tbou dost not enquire wisely concerning
this. Be righteous over-much; neither
make thyself over-wise.</HI><NOTE N="foot" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii. 10, 16.</NOTE> Former follies
pass away, and are forgotten. Those
which are present, strike observation, and
sharpen censure. Had the depravation of
the world continued to increase in propor∣tion
to those gloomy calculations, which,
for so many centuries past, have estimat∣ed
each race as worse than the preceeding,
by this time, not one ray of good sense,
nor one spark of piety and virtue, must
have remained unextinguished among
mankind.</P>
<P>One of the vices of old age, which ap∣pears
the most unaccountable, is that co∣vetous
attachment to worldly interest,
with which it is often charged. But
this too, can naturally be deduced from
the sense of its feebleness and decay.
In proportion as the vigour both of bo∣dy
and mind declines, timidity may
be expected to increase. With anxious
and fearful eye, the aged look forward
<PB N="349" REF="358"/>
to the evils which threaten them, and
to the changes which may befall. Hence,
they are sometimes apt to over-value
riches, as the instrument of their de∣fence
against these dangers, and the most
certain means of securing them against
solitude and disrespect. But though their
apprehensions may justify a cautious fru∣gality,
they can by no means excuse a
fordid avarice. It is no less absurd,
than it is culpable, in the old, from the
dread of uncertain futurity, to deny them∣selves
the enjoyment of the present; and
to increase in anxiety about their jour∣ney,
in proportion as it draws nearer to
its close. There are more effectual me∣thods
of commanding respect from the
world, than the mere possession of wealth.
Let them be charitable, and do good.
Let them mix beneficence to their friends,
with a chearful enjoyment of the com∣forts
which befit their state. They will
then receive the returns of real respect
and love. Whereas, by their riches,
they procure no more than pretended
<PB N="350" REF="359"/>
demonstrations of regard; while their ill∣judged
parsimony occasions many secret
wishes for their death.</P>
<P>As increasing years debilitate the bo∣dy,
so they weaken the force, and dimi∣nish
the warmth of the affections. Chill∣ed
by the hand of time, the heart loses
that tender sensibility, with which it once
entered into the concerns and sorrows of
others. It is, in truth, a merciful ap∣pointment
of Providence, that as they
who see many days, must behold many
a sad scene, the impressions of grief upon
their heart should be blunted by being
often repeated; and that, in proportion
as their power of advancing the pro∣sperity
of others decreases, their parti∣cipation
of the misfortunes of others
should also lessen. However, as, in eve∣ry
period of life, humanity and friend∣ship
contribute to happiness, it is both
the duty and the interest of the aged, to
cherish the remains of the kind affec∣tions;
and, from the days of former
years, to recall such impressions as may
<PB N="351" REF="360"/>
tend to soften their hearts. Let them
not, from having suffered much in the
course of their long pilgrimage, become
callous to the sufferings of others. But
remembering that they still are men, let
them study to keep their heart open to
the sense of human woe. Practised in
the ways of men, they are apt to be
suspicious of dcsign and fraud; for the
knowledge, and the distrust of mankind,
too often go together. Let not, how∣ever,
that wary caution, which is the
fruit of their experience, degenerate into
craft. Experience ought also to have
taught them, that amidst all the false∣hood
of men, integrity is the best de∣fence;
and that he who continueth to
the end to <HI>walk uprightly,</HI> shall continue
to <HI>walk surely.</HI> Having thus offered
some admonitions concerning the errors
most incident to age, I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To point out the duties which pe∣culiarly
belong to it.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="361"/>
The first, which I shall mention, is, a
timely retreat from the world. In every
part of life, we are in hazard of being
too deeply immersed in its cares. But,
in former periods, the impulse of active
spirit, the necessary business of our sta∣tion,
and the allowable endeavours to ad∣vance
our fortune by fair industry, ren∣dered
it difficult to observe due modera∣tion.
In old age, all the motives of
eager pursuit diminish. The voice of
Nature then calls you, to leave to others
the bustle and contest of the world; and
gradually to disengage yourselves from
a burden, which begins to exceed your
strength. Having born your share of the
heat and labour of the day, let the even∣ing
of life be passed in the cool and
quiet shade. It is only in the shade,
that the virtues of old age can flourish.
There, its duties are discharged with
most success; and there, its comforts are
enjoyed with greatest satisfaction.</P>
<P>By the retreat of old age, however, I
do not mean, a total cessation from every
<PB N="353" REF="362"/>
worldly employment. There is an error
in this, as well as in the opposite ex∣treme.
Persons who have been long
harassed with business and care, some∣times
imagine, that when life declines,
they cannot make their retirement from
the world too complete. But where
they expected a delicious enjoyment of
leisure and ease, they have often found
a melancholy solitude. Few are able,
in any period of their days, to bear a
total abstraction from the world. There
remains a vacancy, which they cannot
fill up. Incapable of being always
employed in the exercises of religion,
and often little qualified for the en∣tertainments
of the understanding, they
are in hazard of becoming a burden to
themselves, and to all with whom they
are connected. It is, therefore, the duty
of the aged, not so much to withdraw
entirely from worldly business, as to con∣tract
its circle; not so much to break
off, as to loosen, their communication
with active life. Continuing that train
<PB N="354" REF="363"/>
of occupation to which they have been
most accustomed, let them pursue it with
less intenseness; relaxing their efforts, as
their powers decline; retiring more and
more, from publick observation, to dome∣stick
scenes, and serious thoughts; till,
as the decays of life advance, the world shall
of itself withdraw to a greater distance
from their view; its objects shall gradu∣ally
yield their place to others of more
importance; and its tumults shall sound
in their ears, only like a noise which is
heard from afar.</P>
<P>If it be the duty of the old, to retreat
betimes from the fatigue of worldly care,
it is still more incumbent on them, to
quit the pursuit of such pleasures as are
unsuitable to their years. Chearfulness,
in old age, is graceful. It is the natural
concomitant of virtue. But the chear∣fulness
of age, is widely different from
the levity of youth. Many things are
allowable in that early period, which, in
maturer years, would deserve censure;
but which, in old age, become both ridi∣culous
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
and criminal. By aukwardly af∣fecting
to imitate the manners, and to
mingle in the vanities, of the young, as
the aged depart frorm the dignity, so they
forfeit the privileges of gray hairs. But
if, by follies of this kind, they are de∣graded,
they are exposed to much deeper
blame, by descending to vitious pleasure,
and continuing to hover round those
sinful gratifications to which they were
once addicted. Amusement and relaxa∣tion
the aged require, and. may enjoy.
But let them consider well, that by every
intemperate indulgence, they accelerate
decay; instead of enlivening, they op∣press,
and precipitate, their declining state,
Ease, safety, and respect, are the proper
enjoyments of age. Within these bounds
let it remain, and not vainly attempt to
break through that barrier, by which Na∣ture
has separatcd die pleasures of youth,
from the comforts left to the concluding
years of life.</P>
<P>A material part of the duty of die aged
consists, in studying to be useful to the
<PB N="356" REF="365"/>
race who are to succeed them. Here
opens to them an extensive field, in which
they may so employ themselves, as con∣siderably
to advance the interests of reli∣gion,
and the happiness of mankind. To
them it belongs, to impart to the young
the fruit of their long experience; to in∣struct
them in the proper conduct, and
to warn them of the various dangers, of
life; by wise counsel, to temper their pre∣cipitate
ardour; and, both by precept and
example, to form them to piety and virtue.</P>
<P>It is not by rigorous discipline, and
unrelaxing austerity, that they can main∣tain
an ascendant over youthful minds.
The constraint which their presence
will impose, and the aversion which
their manners will create, if the one be
constantly awful, and the other severe,
tend to frustrate the eflfect of all their
wisdom. They must assume the spirit of
the companion, and the friend; and mix
with the authority of age, a proper de∣gree
of indulgence to the manners of
the young. Instead of lessening the re∣spect
<PB N="357" REF="366"/>
due to their years by such condescen∣sion,
they take the surest method to in∣crease
it. Old age never appears with
greater dignity, than, when tempered by
mildness, and enlivened with good hu∣mour,
it acts as the guide and the pa∣tron
of youth. Religion displayed in
such a character, strikes the beholders,
as at once amiable and venerable. They
revere its power, when they see it adding
so much grace to the decays of nature,
and shedding so pleasing a lustre over
the evening of life. The young with to
tread in the same steps, and to arrive
at the close of their days with equal ho∣nour.
They listen with attention to
counsels, which are mingled with ten∣derness,
and rendered respectable by gray
hairs. For, notwithstanding all its pre∣sumption,
youth naturally bends before
superiour knowledge and years. Aged
wisdom, when joined with acknowledged
virtue, exerts an authority over the hu∣man
mind, greater even than that which
arises from power and station. It can
<PB N="358" REF="367"/>
check the most forward, abash the most
profligate, and strike with awe the most
giddy and unthinking.</P>
<P>In the midst of their endeavours to be
useful to others, let not the aged forget
thosc religious employments, which their
own state particularly requires. The first
of these, is, reflection on their past beha∣viour,
with a view to discover the errors
which they have committed; and, as far
as remaining life allows, to amend and
repent.—Long has the world bewildered
you in its maze, and imposed upon you
by its arts. The time is now come, when
this great seducer should mislead you no
more. From the calm station at which
you are arrived, sequestered from the
crowd of the deceiving, and the deceiv∣ed,
review your conduct, with the eye of
Christians and immortal beings. After
all the tumult of life is over, what now
remains to afford you solid satisfaction?
Have you served God with fidelity, and
discharged your part to your fellow∣creatures
with integrity and a good con∣science?
<PB N="359" REF="368"/>
Can you look forward, without
terrour, to that day which is to dissolve
your connection with this world, and to
bring; you into the presence of him who
mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you, in order to give account of
your actions?—The retrospect of life is
seldom wholly unattended by uneasiness
and shame. Though, to the good and the
bad, it presents a very different scene;
yet, to all men, it recalls much guilt in∣curred,
and much time mispent. It too
much resembles the review, which a tra∣veller
takes from some eminence, of a bar∣ren
country, through which he has pas∣sed,
where the heath and the desert form
the chief prospect; diversified only by a
few scattered spots of imperfect cultiva∣tion.</P>
<P>Turn then your thoughts to the proper
methods of making your peace with God
through Jesus Christ; and implore, from
Divine grace, that <HI>new heart</HI> and <HI>righ
s pirit,</HI> which will fit you for a better world.
Let devotion fill up many of those hours,
which are now vacant from worldly bu∣siness
<PB N="360" REF="369"/>
and care. Let your affections dwell
among divine and immortal objects. In
silent and thoughtful meditation, walk
as on the shore of that vast ocean, upon
which you are soon to embark. Summon
up all the considerations which should
reconcile you to your departure from life;
and which may prepare you for going
through its last scene, with firmness and
decency. Often let your thanksgivings
ascend to God, for that watchful care
with which he hath hitherto conducted
you, through the long journey of life.
Often let your prayers be heard, that, in
what remains of your pilgrimage, he may
not forsake you; and that, when you en∣ter
into the <HI>valley of the shadow of death,</HI>
he may there support you with <HI>his staff,</HI>
and defend you with <HI>his rod.</HI>—Amidst
such thoughts and cares, let old age find
you employed; betaking yourselves to a
prudent and timely retreat; disengaged,
both from the oppressive load of buss∣nes,
and from the unseasonable pursuit
of pleasure; applying yourselves to form
<PB N="361" REF="370"/>
the succeeding race, by your counsels to
virtue and wisdom; reviewing seriously
your past life; by repentance and devo∣tion,
preparing yourselves for a better;
and, with humble and manly composure,
expecting that hour, which Nature cannot
now long delay. It remains,</P>
<P>III. To suggest the consolations which
belong to old age, when thus <HI>found in the
way of righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>I must introduce them with observing,
that nothing is more reasonable in itself,
than to submit patiently to those infirmi∣ties
of Nature, which are brought on by
the increase of years. You knew before∣hand
what you had to expect, when you
numbered the successive Summers and
Winters, which were passing over your
heads.. Old age did not attack you by
surprize, nor was it forced upon you
against your choice. Often, and earnest∣ly,
did you wish to <HI>see long life and many
days.</HI> When arrived at the desired period,
have you any just cause to complain, on
<PB N="362" REF="371"/>
account of enduring what the constitu∣tion
of our being imposes on all? Did
you expect, that, for your sake, Provi∣dence
was to alter its established order?
Throughout the whole vegetable, sensible,
and rational world, whatever makes pro∣gress
towards maturity, as soon as it has
passed that point, begins to verge towards
decay. It is as natural for old age to be
frail, as for the corn to bend under The
ripened ear, or for the autumnal leaf to
change its hue. To this law, all who
went before you, have submitted; and
all who shall come after you, must yield.
After they have flourished for a season,
they shall sink, like you, into the vale of
life, and bow under the pressure of years.
During the whole progress of the hu∣man
course, the principal materials of'our
comfort or uneasiness, lie within ourselves.
Every age will prove burdensome, to those
who have no fund of happiness in their
own breast. Preserve them, if you could,
from all infirmity of frame. Bestow upon
them, if it were possible, perpetual youth;</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="372"/>
still they would be restless and miserable,
through the influence of ill-governed pas∣sions.
No wonder that such persons are
peevish and querulous, when old. Unjustly
they impute to their time of life, that mi∣sery
with which their vices and follies em∣bitter
every age. Whereas, to good men,
no period of life is unsupportable, because
they draw their chief happiness from
sources which are independent of age or
time. Wisdom, piety, and virtue, grow not
old with our bodies. They suffer no decay
from length of days. To them only be∣longs
unalterable and unfading youth.
<HI>Those that be planted in the house of the
Lord, shall flourish in the courts of our
God. They shall siill bring forth fruit in old
age; they shall be fat, and flourishing.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xcii. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>You are now, it is true, past relising
many of those pleasures which once a∣mused
you. Your sensations are less quick
than formerly; your days, more lan∣guishing.
But if you have quitted the
region of pleasure, in return, you possess
that of tranquillity and repose. If you
<PB N="364" REF="373"/>
are strangers of the vivacity of enjoyment,
you are free, at the same time, from the pain
of violent and often disappointed desie.
Much fatigue, much vexation, as well as
vanity, attend that turbulence of life, in
which the younger part of mankind are
engaged. A midst those keen pursuits,
and seeming pleasures, for which you en∣vy
them, often they feel their own misery,
and look forward with a wishful eye to
the season of calmness and retreat. For,
on all sides of human life, the balance of
happiness is adjusted with more equality
than at first appears; and if old age
throws some new distresses into the scale,
it lightens also the weight of others. Many
passions, which formerly created you much
disturbance, have now subsided. Many
competitions, which long filled your days
with disquiet and strife, are now at an
end. Many afflictions, which once rent
your hearts with violent anguish, are now
softened into a tender emotion, on the
remembrance of past woe. In the begin∣nings
of life, there was room for much
<PB N="365" REF="374"/>
apprehension concerning what might be∣fall
in its progress. Your security was
never untroubled. Your hopes were dis∣turbed
with many anxieties and fears.
Having finished the career of labour and
danger, your anxiety ought of course to
lessen. About to enter into the harbour,
you can look back, as from a secure sta∣tion,
upon the perils you have escaped,
upon the tempest by which you was tos∣sed,
and upon the multitudes who are still
conflicting with the storm.</P>
<P>If you have acted your part with inte∣grity
and honour, you are justly entitled
to respect, and you will generally receive
it. For rarely, or never, is old age con∣temned,
unless when, by vice or folly,
it renders itself contemptible. Though
length of time may have worn off super∣ficial
ornaments, yet, what old age loses
in grace, it often gains in dignity. The
veneration, as was before observed, which
gray hairs command, puts it in the power
of the aged, to maintain a very important
place in human society. They are so far
<PB N="366" REF="375"/>
from being insignificant in the world,
that families long held together by their
authority, and societies accustomed to be
guided by their counsels, have frequently
had cause to regret their loss, more than
that of the most vigorous and young. To
success of every kind, the head which di∣rects,
is no less essential, than the hand
which executes. Vain, nay often dan∣gerous,
were youthful enterprise, if not
conducted by aged prudence. <HI>I said, Days
should speak, and multitude of years should
teach wisdom.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">job xxiii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore thou sbalt rise

Though, in old age, the circle of your
pleasures is more contracted than it has
formerly been; yet, within its limits, ma∣ny
of thosc enjoyments remain, which
are most grateful to human nature. Tem∣perate
mirth, is not extinguished by ad∣vanced
years. The mild pleasures of
domestick life, still chear the heart. The
entertainments of conversation, and social
intercourse, continue unimpaired. The
<PB N="367" REF="376"/>
desire of knowledge, is not abated by the
frailty of the body; and the leisure of old
age, affords many opportunities for grati∣fying
that desire. The sphere of your
observation and reflection, is so much en∣larged
by long acquaintance with the
world, as to supply, within itself, a wide
range of improving thought. To recall
the various revolutions which have oc∣curred
since you began to act your part
in life; to compare the characters of past
and present times; to trace the hand of
Providence, in all the incidents of your
own lot; to contemplate with thoughtful
eye, the successive new appearances which
the world has assumed around you, in
government, education, opinions, cus∣toms,
and modes of living; these are
employments, no lefs entertaining, than
instructive to the mind.</P>
<P>While you are engaged in such em∣ployments,
you are perhaps surrounded
with your families, who treat you with
attention and respect; you are honoured
by your friends; your character is esta∣blished;
<PB N="368" REF="377"/>
you are placed beyond the reach
of clamour, <HI>and the strife of tongues;</HI> and,
free from distracting cares, you can at∣tend
calmly to your eternal interests. For
such comforts as these, have you not
cause most thankfully to acknowledge
the goodness of Heaven? Do they not af∣ford
you ground, to pass the remainder of
your days in resignation and peace; dis∣posing
yourselves to rise in due time, like
satisfied guests, from the banquet that
has been set before you; and to praise
and bless, when you depart, the great
Master of the feast? <HI>To a man that is good
in his sight,</HI> whether he be young or old,
<HI>God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.</HI>
For every season of life, the benignity of
his providence hath prepared its own satis∣factions,
while his wisdom hath appointed
its peculiar trials. No age is doomed to
total infelicity; provided that we attempt
not to do violence to Nature, by seeking to
extort from one age, the pleasures of ano∣ther;
and to gather, in the Winter of life,
<PB N="369" REF="378"/>
those flowers which were destined to blos∣som
only in its Summer or its Spring.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it will be said, that I
have considered old age, only its first
stages, and in its most favourable point of
light; before the faculties are as yet much
impaired, and when disease or affliction
has laid no additional load on the bur∣den
of years. Let us then view it, with
all its aggravations of distress. Let us
suppose it arrived at its utmost verge,
worn out with infirmities, and bowed
down by sickness and sorrow. Still there
remains this consolation, that it is not
long <HI>ere the weary shall be at rest.</HI> Having
passed through so many of the toils of life,
you may now, surely, when your pilgri∣mage
touches on its close, bear, without
extreme impatience, the hardships of its
concluding stage. From the inestimable
promises of the Gospel, and from the gra∣cious
presence of God, the afflictions of
old age cannot seclude you. Though <HI>your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart should begin to faint, and flesh to
<PB N="370" REF="379"/>
fail,</HI> there is One, who can be <HI>the strength
of your heart, and your&gt; portion for ever. Even
to your old age, saith the Lord, I am He;
and even to hoary hairs will I carry you.
I have made, and I wiII bear; even I will
carry, and will deliver you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ifa. xlvi. 4.</NOTE>. <HI>Leave thy
fatherless children; I will preserve them
alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</HI><NOTE N="dagger" PLACE="foot">jer. xlix. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is undoubtedly a period, when
there ought to be a satiety of life, as there
is of all other things; and when death
should be viewed, as your merciful dis∣mission
from a long warfare. To come to
the grave in a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in, in its season,<NOTE N="Dagger" PLACE="foot">Job v. 26</NOTE> is the na∣tural
termination of the human course.
Amidst multiplying infirmities, to pro∣long
life beyond its usual bounds, and to
draw out your existence here to the last
and foulest dregs, ought not to be the
wish of any wise man. Is it desirable, to
continue lingering on the borders of the
grave, after every tie which connects you
with life is broken; and to be left a soli∣tary
<PB N="371" REF="380"/>
individual, in the midst of a new ge∣neration,
whose faces you hardly know?
The shades of your departed friends rise up
before you, and warn you, that it is time
to depart. Nature and Providence sum∣mon
you, to be <HI>gathered to your fathers.</HI>
Reason admonishes you, that as your pre∣decessors
made way for you, it is just that
you should yield your place to those, who
have arisen to succeed you on this busy
stage; who, for a while, shall fill it with
their actions and their sufferings, their
virtues and their crimes; and then shall,
in their turn, withdraw, and be joined to
the forgotten multitudes of former ages.</P>
<P>Could death indeed be considered in no
other view, than as the close of life, it
would afford only a melancholy retreat.
The total extinction of being, is a thought
which human nature, in its most distres∣sed
circumstances, cannot bear without
dejection. But, blessed be God! far other
prospects revive the spirits of the aged,
who have spent their life in piety and vir∣tue.
To them, death is not the extinction,
<PB N="372" REF="381"/>
but the renovation of the living principle;
its removal from <HI>the earthly house of this
tabernacle, to the house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens. Having sought the
good sight; having finished their course, and
kept the faith; there is laid up for them▪ the
crown of righteousness.</HI> The Saviour of the
world, hath not only <HI>brought immortality
to light,</HI> but placed it within the reach
of their hope and trust. By making
atonement for their guilt, he hath pre∣pared
their way <HI>within the veil;</HI> and
secured to them, the possession of <HI>an in∣heritance,
incorruptible and unde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled, reserv∣ed
in the heavens.</HI>—Such are the hopes
and prospects, which chear the sorrows
of old age, and surmount the fear of
death. Faith and piety are the only ade∣quate
supports of human nature, in all
its great emergencies. After they have
guided us through the various trials of
life, they uphold us, at last amidst the
ruins of this falling frame; and when
<HI>the silver cord is just ready to be loosed,
<PB N="373" REF="382"/>
and the golden bowl to be broken; when
the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and
the wheel broken at the cistern;</HI> they en∣able

<P>THIS book of Genesis displays a more
singular and interesting scene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> than
was ever presented to the world, by any
other historical record. It carries us back
to the beginning of time; and exhibits
mankind, in their infant and rising state.
<PB N="375" REF="384"/>
It shows us human manners in their pri∣mitive
simplicity, before the arts of refine∣ment
had polished the behaviour, or dis∣guised
the characters of men; when they
gave vent to their passions without dis∣simulation,
and spoke their sentiments
without reserve. Few great societies were,
as yet, formed on the earth. Men lived in
scattered tribes. The transactions of fa∣milies,
made the chief materials of histo∣ry;
and they are related in this book,
with that beautiful simplicity, which, in
the highest degree, both delights the ima∣gination,
and affects the heart.</P>
<P>Of all the patriarchal histories, that of
Joseph and his brethren is the most re∣markable,
for the characters of the actors,
the instructive nature of the events, and
the surprizing revolutions of worldly for∣tune.
As far as relates to the Text, and
is necessary for explaining it, the story is
to the following purpose.—Joseph, the
youngest, except one, of the sons of Jacob,
was distinguished by his father with such
marks of peculiar affection, as excited the
<PB N="376" REF="385"/>
envy of his brethren. Having related to
them, in the openness of his heart, cer∣tain
dreams which portended his future
advancement above them, their jealousy
rose to such a height, that they unnatu∣rally
conspired his destruction. Seizing
the opportunity of his being at a distance
from home, they first threw him into a
pit, and afterwards sold him for a slave;
imposing on their father, by a false rela∣tion
of his death. When they had thus
gratified their resentment, they lost all
remembrance of their crime. The fami∣ly
of Jacob was rich and powerful; and
several years passed away, during which
they lived in prosperity; without being
touched, as far as appears, with the least
remorse for the cruel deed which they
had committed.</P>
<P>Mean-while, Joseph was safely conduct∣ed,
by the hand of Providence, through a
variety of dangers, untill, from the lowest
condition, he rose at laft to be chief fa∣vourite
of the King of Egypt, the most
powerful monarch at that time in the
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
world. While he possessed this high dig∣nity,
a general famine distressed all the
neighbouring countries. In Egypt alone,
by means of his foresight, and prudent ad∣ministration,
plenty still reigned. Com∣pelled
to have recourse to that kingdom
for supply of food, the brethren of Josesph,
upon this occasion, appeared in his pre∣sence,
and made their humble application
to him, for liberty to purchase corn; lit∣tle
suspecting that the Governour of the
land, before whom <HI>they bowed down their
faces to the earth,</HI> was him, whom, long
ago, they had sold as a slave to the Ish∣maelites.
But Joseph no sooner saw, than
he knew his brethren; and, on this un∣expected
meeting, his heart melted with∣in
him. Fraternal tenderness arose, in all
its warmth; and totally essaced, from his
generous breast, the impression of their
ancient cruelty. Though, from that mo∣ment,
he began to prepare for them a sur∣prize
of joy; yet, he so far constrained him∣self,
as to assume an appearance of great
severity. By this he intended, both to ob∣lige
<PB N="378" REF="387"/>
them to bring into Egypt his youngest
and most beloved brother, whose presence
he instantly required; and also, to awaken
within them, a due sense of the crime
which they had formerly perpetrated.
Accordingly, his behaviour produced the
designed effect. For, while they were in
this situation, strangers in a foreign land,
where they had fallen, as they conceived,
into extreme distress; thrown into prison
by the Governour, and treated with ri∣gour
for which they could assign no
cause; the reflection mentioned in the
Text arose in their minds. Conscience
brought to remembrance, their former
sins. It recalled, in particular, their long
forgotten cruelty to Joseph; and, with∣out
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esitation, they interpreted their pre∣sent
distress, to be a judgment, for this
crime, inflicted by Heaven. <HI>They said, one
to another, We are verily guilty concerning
our brother, in that we saw the anguish of
his soul, when he besought us; and we would
not hear: Therefore is this distress come upon
us.—Behold also his blood is required.</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="388"/>
From this instructive passage of histo∣ry,
the following observations naturally
arise. I. That a sense of right and wrong
in conduct, or of moral good and evil,
belongs to human nature. II. That it
produces an apprehension of merited pu∣nishment,
when we have committed evil.</P>
<P>III. That although this inward senti∣ment
be stifhed during the season of
prosperity, yet, in adversity, it will re∣vive.
And, IV. That when it revives,
it determines us to consider every distress
which we suffer, from what cause soever
it has arisen, as an actual infliction of
punishment by Heaven. The conside∣ration
of these particulars, will lead us
to a verv serious view of the nature of
man, and of the government of God.</P>
<P>I. There belongs to human nature, a
sense of moral good and evil, or a fa∣culty
which distinguishes right from
wrong, in action and conduct. <HI>They said,
one to another, We are verily guilty.</HI>—In
an age, when the law was not yet given,
when no external revelation of the Di∣vine
<PB N="380" REF="389"/>
will subsisted, except what had been
handed down among the Patriarchs, from
one generation to another; the brethren
of Joseph reasoned concerning their con∣duct,
upon the same moral principles,
and were affected by the same feelings,
of which we are conscious at this day.
Such sentiments are coeval with human
nature; for they are the remains of a
law, which was originally <HI>written in our
heart.</HI> In the darkest regions of the
earth, and among the rudest tribes of
men, a distinction has ever been made,
between just and unjust, between a duty
and a crime. Throughout all the inter∣course
of human beings, these distinctions
are supposed. They are the foundation
of the mutual trust, which the transac∣tions
of life require; nay, the very enter∣tainments
of society constantly appeal to
them. The Historian, who studies to
magnify his hero, by representing him as
just and generous; the Poet, who seeks
to interest the world in his fictions, by
engaging the heart in behalf of distressed
<PB N="381" REF="390"/>
virtue, are sufficient to confute the Scep∣tick,
who denies any natural perception
of a distinction in actions.</P>
<P>But though a sense of moral good and
evil be deeply impressed on the heart of
man, yet it is not of sufficient power to
regulate his life. In his present corrupt∣ed
state, it is both too general to afford
him full direction in conduct, and too
feeble to withstand the opposition of con∣trary
principles in his nature. It is often
perverted, by ignorance and superstition:
It is too easily overcome, by passion and
desire. Hence, the importance of that
Divine revelation, which communicates
both light and strength; which, by the
instructive discoveries it makes, and by
the powerful assistance it supplies, raises
man to a station, infinitely superiour to
that which he possesses under the mere
light of Nature.</P>
<P>It is of consequence, however, to re∣mark,
that this revelation necessarily sup∣poses,
an antecedent sense of right and
wrong to take place in the human mind,
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
It addresses itself to men, as possessed of
such a faculty; and, when it commands
them, in general terms, to pursue <HI>what∣soever
things are true, whatsoever things
are honest, whatsoever things are just, pure,
lovely, or of good report, if there be any vir∣tue,
and if there be any praise,</HI> it plainly
appeals to the native dictates of their
heart. Nay, unless men were endowed
by Nature, with some sense of duty, or
of moral obligation, they could reap no
benefit from revelation; they would re∣main
incapable of all religion whatever.
For, in vain were a system of duty pre∣scribed
to them by the word of God;
allegiance were in vain required towards
their Creator, or love and gratitude en∣joined
towards their Redeemer; if, pre∣viously,
there was no principle in their
nature, which made them feel the obliga∣tions
of duty, of allegiance, and of gra∣titude.
They could have no ideas cor∣responding
to such terms; nor any con∣viction,
that, independently of fear or in∣terest,
they were bound to regard, either
<PB N="383" REF="392"/>
him who made, or him who redeemed
them.–This, therefore, is to be held as a
principal fundamental to all religion, That
there is in human nature, an approving
or condemning sense of conduct; by
means of which, <HI>they who have not the
law, are a law unto themselves</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 14.</NOTE>. They,
who from a mistaken zeal for the honour
of Divine revelation, either deny the ex∣istence,
or vilify the authority, of natural
religion, are not aware, that, by disallow∣ing
the sense of obligation, they under∣mine
the foundation, on which revela∣tion
builds its power of commanding
the heart.</P>
<P>The Text leads us to observe, that one
of the cases in which the natural sense of
good and evil operates most forcibly, is,
when men have been guilty of injustice
or inhumanity. <HI>We saw the anguish of
our brother's soul when he besought us, and
we would not hear.</HI> An inward principle
prompts us to do good to others; but
with much greater authority, it checks
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
and condemns us, when we have done
them injuries. This part of the human
constitution deserves particular remark,
as a signal proof of the wisdom of its Au∣thor,
and of the gracious provision which
he has made for the welfare of mankind.
We are all committed, in some measure,
to the care and assistance of one another.
But our mutual influence reaches much
farther, with respect to the evils, than
with respect to the enjoyments, of those
around us. To advance their prosperity,
is often beyond our ability; but to in∣flict
injuries, is almost always within our
power: And, at the same time, self-inte∣rest
very frequently tempts us to commit
them. With the utmost propriety, there∣fore,
we are so framed, that the influence
of the moral principle should be most
authoritative, in cases where its aid is most
needed; that to promote the happiness
of others, should appear to us as praise∣worthy,
indeed, and generous; but that,
to abstain from injuring them, should be
felt as matter of the strictest duty.—
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
Amidst the distress which the Patriarchs
suffered in Egypt, had only this sugges∣tion
occurred, “We saw our brother
beginning to prosper, and we contri∣buted
not to his advancement,” their
minds would have been more easily quiet∣ed.
But, when their reflection was, <HI>We
saw his anguish when he besought us, and
we would not hear,</HI> then, compunction
turned upon them its sharpest edge. I
proceed to observe,</P>
<P>II. THAT our natural sense of right
and wrong, produces an apprehension of
merited punishment, when we have com∣mitted
a crime. When it is employed in
surveying the behaviour of others, it dis∣tinguishes
some actions, as laudable and
excellent; and disapproves of others, as
evil and base. But when it is directed
upon our own conduct, it assumes a
higher office, and exercises the authority
of a judge. It is then properly termed,
Conscience; and the sentiments which it
awakens, upon the perpetration of a crime,
<PB N="386" REF="395"/>
are stiled, Remorse. <HI>Therefore,</HI> said the
brethren of Joseph, <HI>is this distress come
upon us; behold also, his blood is re∣quired.</HI>
They acknowledged, not only
that they had committed, a wrong, but a
wrong for which they were justly doom∣ed
to suffer.</P>
<P>Did not conscience suggest this natural
relation between guilt and punishment,
the mere principle of approbation, or dis∣approbation,
with respect to moral con∣duct,
would prove of small efficacy. For
disapprobation attends,, in, some degree,
every conviction of impropriety or folly.
When one has acted unsuitably to his
interest, or has trespassed against the rules
of prudence or decorum, he reflects upon
his conduct with pain, and acknowledges
that he deserves blame. But the diffe∣rence
between the sense of misconduct,
and the sense of guilt, consists in this,
that the latter penetrates much deeper
into the heart. It makes the criminal
feel, that he is not only blameablc, but
justly punishable, for the part which he
<PB N="387" REF="396"/>
has actcd. With reference to this office
of conscience, the inspired writers fre∣quently
speak of it in terms borrowed
from the awful solemnities of judicial
procedure; as, <HI>bearing witness for or against
us; accusing or excusing judging and con∣demning.</HI>
It will be found, that in the
the languages of most nations, terms of
the same import are applied to the opera∣tions
of conscience; expressing the sense,
which all mankind have, of its passing
sentence upon them, and pronouncing
rewards or punishments to be due to
their actions.</P>
<P>The sense of punishment merited, you
are further to observe, can never be se∣parated
from the dread, that at some time,
and in some way or other, punishment
shall be actually inflicted. This dread is
not confined to the vengeance of man.
For, let the sinner's evil deeds be ever so
thoroughly concealed from the knowledge
of the world, his inward alarms are not
quieted upon that account. Now, punish∣ment
is the sanction of a law. Every law
<PB N="388" REF="397"/>
supposes a rightful superiour: And there∣fore,
when conscience threatens punish∣ment
to secret crimes, it manifestly recog∣nizes
a supreme Governour, from whom
nothing is hidden. The belief of our be∣ing
accountable to him, is what the most
hardened wickedness has never been able
to eradicate. It is a belief which, arises,
not merely from reasoning, but from the
powerful impression of Nature. Con∣science
is felt to act as the delegate of an
invisible Ruler; both anticipating his
sentence, and foreboding its execution.</P>
<P>Hence arise the terrours, which so of∣ten
haunt guilt, and rise in proportion to
its atrocity. In the history of all nati∣ons,
the Tyrant and the Oppressor, the
bloody and the flagitious, have been ever
pointed out as fearful, unquiet, and rest∣less;
subject to alarms and apprehensions
of an unaccountable kind. And surely,
to live under such disquietude, from the
dread of merited punishment, is already
to undergo one of the most severe punish∣ments
which human nature can suffer.
<PB N="389" REF="398"/>
When the world threatens us with any
of its evils, we know the extent, and dis∣cern
the limits of the danger. We see the
quarter, on which we are exposed to its
attack. We measure our own strength,
with that of our adversary; and can take
precautions, either for making resistance,
or for contriving escape. But when an
awakened conscience places before the
sinner, the just vengeance of the Al∣mighty,
the prospect is confounding, be∣cause
the danger is boundless. It is a
dark unknown which threatens him. The
arm that is stretched over him, he can
neither see nor resist. On every side, he
dreads it; and on every object which
surrounds him, he looks with terrour, be∣cause
he is conscious it can be employed
against him as an instrument of wrath.
No wonder that the lonesome solitude,
or the midnight hour, should strike him
with horrour. His troubled mind be∣holds
forms, which other men see not;
and hears voices, which found only in
the car of guilt. A hand appears to come
<PB N="390" REF="399"/>
forth, and to write upon the wall over
against him; as it did of old, in the sight
of an impious monarch. He shall find
no ease nor rest. <HI>For the Lord shall give
him a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
and sorrow of mind: And his life shall hang
in doubt before him; and he shall fear day
and night, and have none assurance of his life.
In the morning he shall say, Would to God it
were even; and at even he shall say, Would
to God it were morning, for the fear of his
heart wherewith he shall fear, and for
the sight which his eyes shall see.</HI> His
life shall be grievous unto him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxviii 65. 66, 67 Ifa. xv. 4.</NOTE>.—Adver∣sity!
how blunt are all the arrows of
thy quiver, in comparison with those of
guilt!—But if such be the power of
conscience, whence, it may be asked,
comes it to pass, that its influence is not
more general, either in restraining men
from the commission of sin, or in lead∣ing
them to a timely repentance? This
brings me to observe,
<PB N="391" REF="400"/>
III. THAT, during a course of prospe∣rity,
the operations of conscience are of∣ten
suspended; and that adversity is the
season which restores them to their proper
force. At the time when crimes are com∣mitted,
the mind is too much, heated by passion,
and engrossed by the object of its pursuit, to
be capable of proper reflec∣tion.
After this tumult of spirits has
subsided, if a train of new passions be at
hand to employ its activity, or a succes∣sion
of pleasurable objects occur to en∣gage
its attention, it may for a while re∣main,
though not entirely free from in∣ward
misgivings, yet unconscious of the
degree of its guilt. Dissipated among the
amusements of life, the sinner escapes, in
some measure, from his own view. If he
reflects upon himself at all, the continu∣ance
of prosperity seems to him a strong
justification of his conduct. For it will
be found, that in the hearts of all men,
there is a natural propensity, to judge of
the favour of the Supreme Being, from
the course of external events. When they
<PB N="392" REF="401"/>
are born wish a smooth gale along the
stream of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> and behold every thing
proceeding according to their with, hard∣ly
can they be brought to believe, that
Providence is their enemy. Basking in
the sun-shine of prosperity, they suppose
themselves to enjoy the smile of indul∣gent
Heaven; and fondly conclude, that
they are on terms of friendship, with all
above, and with all below. Easy they
find it, then, to spread over the grossest
crimes, a covering, thin, indeed, and
slight, yet sufficient to conceal them from
a superficial view.</P>
<P>Of this we have a very remarkable in∣stance,
in those brethren of Joseph, whose
history we now consider. Not only the
silence of the inspired writer, gives us
ground to conclude, that their remorse
was stifled until the present period; but,
at a former one, when, in the time of
their prosperity, they were contriving the
destruction of Joseph, we find Judah say∣ing
to his brethren, <HI>What profit is it, if we
slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
<PB N="393" REF="402"/>
Let us sell him to the Ishmalites; and let
not our hand be upon him; for he is our bro∣ther
and our flesh: And his brethren were
content</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxvii. 26, 27.</NOTE>. Here you behold them justi∣fying
their crime, by a sort of pretended
humanity; and making light of selling
their brother for a slave, because they did
not take away his life. How strangely
are the opinions of men altered, by a
change in their condition! How different
is this sentiment of the Patriarchs, from
that which they afterwards entertained of
the same action, when, as you see in the
Text, the remembrance of it wrung their
hearts with anguish!</P>
<P>But men, in truth, differ as much from
themselves, in prosperity, and in adversity,
as if they were different creatures. In pro∣sperity,
every thing tends to flatter and
deceive. In adversity, the illusions of life
vanish. Its avocations, and its pleasures,
no longer afford the sinner that shelter
he was wont to find from conscience.
Formerly, he made a part of the crowd.
He now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eels himself a solitary individual,
<PB N="394" REF="403"/>
left alone with God, and with his own mind.
His spirits are not supported, as
before, by fallacious views of the favour
of Heaven. The <HI>candle of the Lord</HI> shine,
not on his head; his pride is humbled;
and his affections are softened, for receiv∣ing
every serious impression. In this situ∣ation,
a man's <HI>iniquity is sure to find him
out.</HI> Whatever has been notoriously cri∣minal
in his former conduct, rises as a
spectre, and places itself before him. The
increased sensibility of his mind, renders
him alive to feelings which lately were
faint; and wounds which had been ill
healed, bleed afresh. When <HI>men take the
timbrel and the harp, and rejoice at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound
of the organ, they say, What is the Almighty
that we should serve him?</HI> But when <HI>they
are holden in the cords of affliction, then he
sheweth them their work, and their trans∣gression,
that they have exceeded. He open∣eth
also their ears to discipline; and com∣mandeth,
that they return from iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, we may perceive the great use∣fulness,
and propriety, of that interchange
<PB N="395" REF="404"/>
of conditions, which takes place in hu∣man
life. By prosperity, God gives.
scope to our passions, and makes trial of
our dispositions. By adversity, he revives
the serious principle within. Neither the
one, nor the other, could he born entire
and unmixed. Man, always prosperous,
would, be giddy and insolent; always af∣flicted,
would be sullen and despondent.
Hopes and fears, joy and sorrow, are,
therefore, So blended in his life, as both
to give room for worldly pursuits, and
to recall, from time to time, the admo∣nitions
of conscience. Of the proportion
in which they should be mixed for this
purpose, we are very incompetent judges.
From our ignorance of the degree of dis∣cipline,
which the spiritual state of others
requires, we often tax Providence un∣justly,
for its severity towards them:
And, from the vanity and rashncss of
our wishes, we complain, without rea∣s;on,
of its rigour to ourselves. While
we consult nothing but our ease, God
attends to our Spiritual improvement.
<PB N="396" REF="405"/>
When we seek what is pleasing, he sends
what is useful. When, by drinking too
deep of worldly prosperity, we draw in a
secret poison, he mercifully infuses a me∣dicine,
when he troubles and embitters
the waters. It remains now to observe,</P>
<P>IV. That when conference is tho∣roughly
awakened, it determines the fin∣ner,
to consider every calamity which he
suffers, as a positive infliction of punishi∣ment
by Heaven. As it had before
alarmed him with threatenings of Di∣vine
displeasure, it tells him, when he
falls under distress, that the threatened
day of account is come. Afflictions, on
some occasions, rise directly out of our
sins. Thus, diseases are brought on by
intemperance; poverty springs from idle∣ness;
and disgrace, from presumption.
In such cases, the punishment is fo close∣ly
connected with the crime, that it is
impossible to avoid discerning the rela∣tion
which the one bears to the other.
But the appointment of Providence,
<PB N="397" REF="406"/>
which we now consider, reaches farther
than this. God has framed us so, that
distresses, which have no perceivable
connection with our former crimes, are,
nevertheless, interpreted by conscience, to
be inflicted, on their account. They
force themselves upon our apprehension,
under this view. They are made to car∣ry,
not only that degree of pain which
properly belongs to themselves, but that
additional torment also, which arises
from, the belief of their being the ven∣geance
of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Let a man fall unexpectedly into some
deep calamity. Let that calamity be
brought upon him, either by means
which the world calls fortuitous; or by a
train of incidents, in which his own
misconduct, or guilt, has apparently had
no part; yet one of the first questions,
which, in such a situation, he puts to
himself, is, “What have I done to deserve
this? His reflection is, almost instinc∣tively,
drawn back upon his former life;
and if, in the course of that retrospect,
<PB N="398" REF="407"/>
any slagrant guilty deed occur to smite
his conscience, on this he cannot avoid
resting with anxiety and terrour, and
connecting it in his imagination, with
what he now suffers. He sees, or thinks
that he sees, a Divine arm lifted up; and
what, in other circumstances, he would
have called a reverse of fortune, he now
views as a judgment of Heaven.</P>
<P>When the brethren of Joseph, confined
in the Egyptian prison, were bewailing
the distress into which they had fallen,
there was no circumstance which point∣ed
out any relation between their present
misfortune, and their former cruelty to
their brother. A long course of years had
intervened, during which they flourish∣ed
in wealth and ease. They were now
far from the scene of their crime; in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
foreign land, where they believed them∣selves
utterly unknown, and where they
had done nothing to offend. But con∣science
formed a connection between
events, which, to the ordinary apprehen∣sion
of men, had none. It made them
<PB N="399" REF="408"/>
recollect, that they, who once had been
deaf to the supplications of a brother,
were now left friendless and forlorn, im∣ploring
pity in vain from an unrelenting
Governour; and that they who had first
conspired to kill their brother, and after∣wards
sold him for a slave, were them∣selves
deprived of liberty, and threatened
with an ignominious death. How unde∣servedly
soever these evils befell them on
the part of men, they confessed them to
be just on the part of Providence. They
concluded the hour of retribution to be
arrived; and, in the person of the Go∣vernour
of Egypt, they beheld the Ruler
of the world calling them to account for
guilt. <HI>Therefore is this distress come upon
us. Behold also, his blood is required.</HI></P>
<P>Similar sentiments, on like occasions,
will be found not uncommon among
mankind. Pious men, there is no doubt,
are at all times disposed to look up to
God, and to acknowledge his hand in
every event of life. But what I now ob∣serve,
is, that where no habitual acknow∣ledgment
<PB N="400" REF="409"/>
of God takes place; nay, where
a daring contempt of his authority ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prevailed, conscience, nevertheless, con∣strains
men, in the day of their distress,
to recognize God, under the most awful
of all characters, The avenger of pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
guilt.</P>
<P>Herein the wisdom of God appears in
such a light, as justly to claim our highest
admiration. The ordinary course of his
Providence, is carried on by human means.
He has settled a train of events, which
proceed in a regular succession of causes
and effects, without his appearing to in∣terpose,
or to act. But these, on proper
occasions, are made to affect the human
mind, in the same manner as if he were
beheld descending from his throne, to
punish the sinner with his own hand.
Were God to suspend the laws of Nature,
on occasion of every great crime that was
committed on earth, and to govern the
world by frequent interpositions of a mi∣raculous
kind, the whole order of human
affairs would be unhinged; no plans of
<PB N="401" REF="410"/>
action could be formed; and no scope
would be given for the probation and
trial of men. On the other hand, were
the operation of second causes allowed
to conceal a Divine hand totally from
view, all sense of superiour government
would be lost; the world would seem to
be void of God; the sinner would per∣ceive
nothing but chance and fortune, in
the distresses which he suffered. Whereas,
by its being so ordered, that several in∣cidents
of life, shall carry the same force,
and strike the mind with the same im∣pression,
as if they were supernatural in∣terpositions,
the fear of God is kept alive
among men, and the order of human af∣fairs
is, at the same time, preserved un∣broken.
The sinner sees his distress to
be the immediate effect of human vio∣lence
or oppression; and is obliged, at
the same moment, to consider it as a Di∣vine
judgment. His conscience gives to
an ordinary misfortune, all the edge and
the sting, of a visitation from Heaven.
<PB N="402" REF="411"/>
FROM the train of thought which the
Text has suggested, several inferences na∣turally
follow. But I shall confine myself
to two, which claim your particular at∣tention.</P>
<P>The first is, the clear evidence which
the preceeding observations a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford, of a
Divine government, now exercised over
mankind. This most important and aw∣ful
of all truths, cannot be too often pre∣sented
to our view, or too strongly im∣pressed
on our mind. To the imperfect
conviction of it, which obtains in the
world, must be ascribed, in a great mea∣sure,
the prevalence of sin. Did men
firmly believe, that the Almighty Being,
who formed them, is carrying on a sy∣stem
of administration which will not
leave guilt unpunished, it is impossible
that they could remain so inattentive, as
we often behold them, to their moral
conduct. But the bulk of mankind are
giddy and thoughtless. Struck by the
superficial appearances of pleasure, which
accompany licentiousness, they enquire
<PB N="403" REF="412"/>
no farther; and deliver themselves up to
their senses, and their passions. Where∣as,
were they to reflect, but for a mo∣ment,
upon that view which has nowbeen
given of human nature, they might
soon be satisfied, that the moral govern∣ment
of God is no matter of doubtful
discussion. It is a fact, no less obvious
and incontestable, than the government
exercised by those earthly rulers, whom
we behold with the ensigns of their of∣fice,
before our eyes.</P>
<P>To govern, is to require a certain
course of action, or, to prescribe a law;
and to enforce that law, by a suitable
distribution of rewards and punishments.
Now, God has not only invested con∣science,
as we have seen, with authority
to promulgate, but endowed it also with
power to enforce, his law. By placing
inward approbation and peace on the side
of virtue, he gave it the sanction of re∣ward.
But this was not enough. Pain
is a more powerful principle, than p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣sure.
To escape misery, is a stronger mo∣tive
<PB N="404" REF="413"/>
for action, than to obtain good. God,
therefore, so framed human nature, that
the painful sense of ill-desert should at∣tend
the commission of crimes; that this
sense of ill-desert should necessarily pro∣duce
the dread of punishment; and that
this dread should so operate on the mind,
in the time of distress, as to make the
sinner conceive Providence to be engaged
against him, and to be concerned in in∣flicting
the punishment which he suffers.
All these impressions he hath stamped
upon the heart with his own hand. He
hath made them constituent parts of our
frame; on purpose, that by the union of
so many strong and pungent sentiments,
he might enforce repentance and refor∣mation,
and publish to the human race
his detestation of sin. Were he to speak
to us from the clouds, his voice could not
be more decisive. What we discern to
be interwoven with the contexture of
human nature, and to pervade the whole
course of human affairs, carries an evi∣dence
not to be resisted. We might, with
<PB N="405" REF="414"/>
as much reason, doubt whether the sun
was intended to enlighten the earth, or
the rain, to fertilize it; as whether he,
who thus framed the human mind, in∣tended
to announce righteousness to man∣kind,
as his law.</P>
<P>THE second inference which I make
from the foregoing discourse, respects the
intimate connection, which those opera∣tions
of conscience have, with the pecu∣liar
and distinguishing doctrines of the
Gospel of Christ. They will be found to
accord with them So remarkably, as to
furnish an answer to some of those ob∣jections,
which superficial reasoners are
apt to raise against the Christian revela∣tion.
In particular, they coincide with
that awful view which the Gospel gives
us, of the future consequences of guilt.
If the sinner is now constrained by con∣science,
to view the Almighty as pur∣suing
him with evil for long-forgotten
crimes, how naturally must he conclude,
that, in a subsequent period of existence,
<PB N="406" REF="415"/>
the Divine administration will proceed
upon the same plan, and complete what
has been left imperfect here? If, during
this life, which is only the time of trial,
the displeasure of Providence at sin is
displayed by tokens so manifest, what
may be apprehended to follow, when ju∣stice,
which at present only begins to be
executed, shall be carried to its consum∣mation?
What conscience forebodes, reve∣lation
verifies; assuring us, that a day is
appointed, when <HI>God will render to every
man according to his works; to them, who
by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for
glory, honour, and immortality; eternal life:
But unto them that are contentious, and obey
not the truth, but obey unrighteousness; in∣dignation
and wrath, tribulation and an∣guish,
upon every soul of man that doth evil,
of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile. For
there is no respect of persons with God. For
as many as have sinned without the law,
shall also perish without the law; and as
many as have sinned in the law, shall be
judged by the law</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 7,—13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="416"/>
While the threatenings of conscience
thus strengthen the evidence of the scrip∣ture
doctrine concerning future punish∣ments,
they likewise pave the way for
the belief of what is revealed concerning
the method of our deliverance by Christ.
They suggest to the sinner, some deep
and dark malignity contained in guilt,
which has drawn upon his head such
high displeasure from Heaven. They
call forth his most anxious efforts, to avert
the effects of that displeasure, and to pro∣pitiate
his offended judge. Some atone∣ment,
he is conscious, must be made;
and the voice of Nature has, in every age,
loudly demanded suffering, as the proper
atonement for guilt. Hence, mankind
have constantly fled for refuge to such
substitutions, as they could devise to place
in the room of the offender; and, as by
general consent, victims have every where
been slain, and expiatory sacrifices have
been offered up on innumerable altars.
<HI>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,
and bow myself before the most high God?
<PB N="408" REF="417"/>
Shall I come before him with burnt offer∣ings,
and calves of a year old? Will the
Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,
or with ten thousand of rivers of oil? Or, shall
I give my first born for my trans∣gression;
the fruit of my body, for the sin
of my soul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Micah vi. 6, 7.</NOTE>? These perplexities, and agi∣tations
of a guilty conscience, may be
termed preludes, in some measure, to the
Gospel of Christ. They are the pointings
of unenlightened Nature, towards that
method of relief, which the grace of God
has provided. Nature felt its inability
to extricate itself from the consequences
of guilt: The Gospel, reveals the plan of
Divine interposition and aid. Nature
onfessed some atonement to be neces∣sary:
The Gospel, discovers that the ne∣cessary
atonement is made. The remedy
is no sooner presented, than its suitable∣ness
to the disease appears; and the great
mystery of redemption, though it reaches,
in its full extent, beyond our comprehen∣sion,
yet, as far as it is revealed, holds a
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
visible congruity with the sentiments of
conscience, and of nature.</P>
<P>Natural and revealed religion proceed
from the same Author; and, of course,
are analogous and consistent. They are
parts of the same plan of Providence.
They are connected measures of the same
system of government. The serious be∣lief
of the one, is the best preparation for
the reception of the other. Both concur
in impressing our mind with a deep sense
of one most important truth, which is
the result of this whole discourse, that as
<HI>we sow now, we must reap;</HI> that under
the government of God, no one shall be
permitted, with impunity, to gratify his
criminal passions, and to make light of
the great duties of life.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Mixture of JOY and FEAR in
RELIGION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM ii. II.</BIBL>
<Q>Rejoice with trembling.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOY and Fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE> are two great springs
of human action. The mixed con∣dition
of this world, gives scope for
both; and, according as either predo∣minates,
it influences the general tenour
of our conduct. Each of them possesses
a proper place in religion. To <HI>serve the
Lord with gladness,</HI> is the exhortation of
the Psalmist David<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. C. 2.</NOTE> To <HI>serve him with
reverence and godly fear,</HI> is the admoni∣tion
of the Apostle Paul<NOTE N="$$" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. But, under
the present imperfection of human na∣ture,
<PB N="411" REF="420"/>
each of these principles may be car∣ried
to a dangerous extreme. When the
whole of religion is placed in joy, it is
in hazard of rising into unwarrantable
rapture. When it rests altogether on
fear, it degenerates into superstitious ser∣vility.
The Text enjoins a due mixture
of both; and inculcates this important
maxim, That joy, tempered with fear, is
the proper disposition of a good man.
In discoursing of this subject, I shall
endeavour to show, first, That joy is
essential to religion; and next, That, for
for various reasons, this joy ought to be
mixed with fear; whence, we shall be
able to ascertain the nature of that steady
and composed spirit, which is most suit∣able
to our present condition, and most
acceptable to the God whom we serve.</P>
<P>I. JOY is essential to religion in two
respects; as religion inspires joy, and as
it requires it. In other words; To rejoice,
is both the privilege, and the duty, of
good men.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="421"/>
In the first place, religion inspires joy.
It affords just ground of gladness, to all
who firmly believe its doctrines, and sin∣cerely
study to obey its laws; For it con∣fers
on them, the two most material re∣quisites
of joy; a favourable situation of
things without, and a proper disposition
of mind within, to relish that favourable
situation.</P>
<P>When they examine their situation
without, they behold themselves placed
in a world, which is full of the influence
of a gracious Providence; where beauty
and good are every where predominant;
where various comforts are bestowed;
and where, if any be with-held, they have
reason to believe, that they are with-held
by parental Wisdom. Among the crowd
that encompass them, they may be at a
loss to discern, who are their friends, and
who their enemies. But it is sufficient to
know, that they are under the protection
of an invisible Guardian, whose power
can keep them from every evil. All the
steps of his conduct, they may be unable
<PB N="413" REF="422"/>
to trace. Events may befall them, of
which they can give no account. But as
long as they are satisfied, that the system of
Divine government is founded on mercy,
no present occurrences are able to destroy
their peace. <HI>For he who spared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for them, how
shall he not with him, freely give them all
things?</HI> If their nature is frail, Divine
assistance is promised to strengthen it. If
their virtue is imperfect, a dispensation is
opened, which gives them the hope of
pardon. If their external circumstances
be in any respect unfavourable, it is be∣cause
a higher interest is consulted. <HI>All
things,</HI> they are assured, <HI>shall work toge∣ther
for their good.</HI> On their prosperity
rests, the blessing; on their adversity, the
sanctifying spirit, of the Almighty. Old
age may advance, and life decay; but
beyond those boundaries of Nature, faith
opens the prospect of their lasting felicity.
Without anxiety, they pass through the
different periods of their present existence,
<PB N="414" REF="423"/>
because they know it to be no more than
an introduction, to immortality.</P>
<P>As such a situation of things without,
lays a solid foundation for joy, so the dis∣position
which religion forms within, pro∣motes
the relish of it. It is indeed from
within, that the chief sources of enjoy∣ment
or trouble rise. The minds of bad
men are always disorderly; and hence
their lives are so generally uneasy. In vain
<HI>they take the timbrel and the harp, and</HI> en∣deavour
to <HI>rejoice at the sound of the organ.</HI>
Spleen and disgust pursue them, through
all the haunts of amusement. Pride and
ill humour torment them. Oppressed
with discontent, their spirits flag; and
their worn-out pleasures, assord them en∣tertainment
no more. But religion sub∣dues
those malignant passions, which are
the troublers of human repose; which
either overcast the mind with the gloom of
peevishness, or disquiet it by the violence
of agitation. It infuses, in their room,
those mild and gentle dispositions, whose
natural effect is to smooth the tenour of
<PB N="415" REF="424"/>
the soul. Benevolence and candour, mo∣deration
and temperance, wherever they
reign, produce chearfulness and serenity.
The consciousness of integrity, gives case
and freedom to the mind. It enables
good men to extract from every object,
the whole satisfaction which it is capable
of yielding; and adds the flavour of in∣nocence,
to all their external pleasures.</P>
<P>IN the second place, As religion natu∣rally
inspires joy, so, what it inspires, it
commands us to cherish. As a necessary
proof of our sincerity, it requires chear∣fulness
in the performance of our duty;
because, if this be wanting, our religion
discovers itself not to be genuine in prin∣ciple,
and in practice it cannot be stable.</P>
<P>Religious obedience, desitute of joy, is
not genuine in its principle. For did
either faith or hope, the love of God, or
the love of goodness, rule the heart; they
could not fail to produce satisfaction in
piety and virtue. All those causes of joy
which I have mentioned, would then ope∣rate;
<PB N="416" REF="425"/>
rate; and their native effect on the mind,
would follow. The prospects which re∣ligion
opens, would gladden, and the af∣fections
which it inspires, would sooth
the heart. We serve with pleasure, the
benefactor whom we love. We rejoice
in every study and pursuit, to which we
are sincerely attached. If we serve not
God with pleasure, it is because we know
him not, or love him not. If we rejoice
not in virtue, it is because our affection
is alienated from it, and our inclinations
are depraved. We give too evident proof,
that either we believe not the principles
of religion, or that we feel not their
power. Exclude joy from religion; and
you leave no other motives to it, except
compulsion and interest. But are these
suitable grounds, on which to rest the
whole of our obedience to the Supreme
Being? <HI>My son give me thy heart,</HI> is the
call of God. Surely if there be no plea∣sure
in fulfilling his commands, the heart
is not given to him; and, in that case,
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
<HI>the multitude of sacrifices, and burnt offer∣ings,</HI>
is brought to his altar in vain</P>
<P>As religion, destitute of joy, is imperfect
in its principle, so, in practice, it must be
unstable. In vain, you endeavour to fix
any man to the regular performance of
that, in which he finds no pleasure. Bind
him ever so fast by interest or fear, he
will contrive some method of eluding the
obligation. Ingenuity is never so fertile
of evasions, as where pleasure is all on
the one side, and mere precept on the
other. He may study to save appearances.
He may dissemble and constrain himself.
But his heart revolts in secret; and the
weight of inclination, will, in the end,
draw the practice after it. If perseverance
is not to be expected, still less can zeal
be looked for, from him, who, in his re∣ligious
duties, trembles without rejoicing.
Every attempt towards virtue which he
forms, will be feeble and awkward. He
applies to it as a task; he dreads the task∣master;
but he will labour no more, than
necessity enjoins. To escape from punish∣ment,
<PB N="418" REF="427"/>
is his sole aim. He bargains for
immunity, by every duty which he per∣forms;
and all beyond, he esteems su∣perfluous
toil.—Such religion as this, can
neither purify the heart, nor prepare for
heavenly bliss. It is the refuge of an ab∣ject
mind. It may form the ritual of the
monk, or prescribe the penance of the
idolater; but has no concern with the ho∣mage
of him, who <HI>worships the Father in
spirit and in truth.</HI> His character is, that
<HI>the joy of the Lord is his strength</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neh. Viii. 1▪</NOTE>. It at∣taches
his heart to religion. It inspires his
zeal. It supports his constancy; and ac∣celerates
his progress.</P>
<P>There is no man, but has some object
to which he cleaves for enjoyment; some∣what
that flatters him with distant hope,
or affords him present pleasure. Joy is
the end towards which all rational beings
tend. For the sake of it, they live; it re∣sembles
the air they breath, which is ne∣cessary
for the motion of the heart, and
all the vital functions. But as the breath∣ing
of infected air proves fatal to life; in
<PB N="419" REF="428"/>
the same manner, joy drawn from a cor∣rupted
source, is destructive, both of vir∣tue,
and of true happiness. When you
have no pleasure in goodness, you may
with certainty conclude the reason to be,
that your pleasure is all derived from an
opposite quarter. You have exhausted
your affection upon the world. You have
drunk too much of its poisoned waters,
to have any relish for a pure spring.</P>
<P>Estimate, therefore, the genuineness of
your religious principles, estimate the de∣gree
of your stability in religious prac∣tice,
by the degree of your satisfaction in
piety and virtue. Be ssured, that where
your treasure is, there will your delight
be also. The worldly man rejoices in his
possessions; the voluptuous, in his plea∣sures;
the social, in his friends and com∣panions.
The truly good man, rejoices in
<HI>doing justly, loving mercy, and walking
humbly with the Lord his God.</HI> He is hap∣py,
when employed in the regular dis∣charge
of the great duties of life. Spon∣taneous
and chearful, they flow from the
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
affections of a pure heart. Not only
from the keeping of the Divine com∣mandments
he expects, but <HI>in the keeping
of them,</HI> he enjoys, <HI>a great reward.</HI>—Ac∣cordingly,
in the sentiments of holy men
recorded in scripture, we find this spirit
every-where prevalent. Their language
was; <HI>Thy statutes have I taken at mine he∣ritage
for ever; for they are the rejoicing of
my heart. They are my songs in the house of
my pilgrimage. They are sweeter than honey,
and the honey comb. Whom have I in hea∣ven
but thee? And there is none upon earth
that I desire besides thee.</HI> They did not re∣ceive
<HI>the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of
adoption. They were filled with peace and
joy in believing. They rejoiced in hope of the
glory of God.</HI> As soon as the AEthiopian
eunuch received from Philip the light of
the Gospel, that light revived and chear∣ed
his heart. A new sun seemed to arise;
a new glory, to shine around him. Every
object brightened; <HI>and he went on his
way rejoicing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 39.</NOTE>. After the same manner
<PB N="421" REF="430"/>
should every good man proceed in his
journey through life, with a serene and
chearful spirit. Consternation and de∣jection
let him leave to the slaves of guilt,
who have every thing to dread, both from
this world, and the next. If he appear
before others with a dispirited aspect, he
dishonours religion; and affords ground,
for suspicion, that he is either ignorant
of its nature, or a stranger to its power.</P>
<P>Thus I have shown joy to be essential
to religion. It is the sprit which it in∣spires,
and which it requires, in good
men. But in our present state, the best
principles may be carried to a dangerous
excess; and joy, like other things, has
its due limits. To serve God with un∣mixed
delight, belongs to more advan∣ced
spirits in a happier world. In this
region of imperfection, some infusions
from a different cup, must of necessity
tincture our joy. Let us then,</P>
<P>II. TURN to the other side of the ar∣gument,
and consider the reasons which
<PB N="422" REF="431"/>
render it proper, that when we rejoice,
we should <HI>rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place, bccause all the ob∣jects
of religion, which afford ground
for joy, tend to inspire, at the same time,
reverence and fear. We serve a Bene∣factor,
it is true, in whom we have rea∣son
to delight; whose purposes are gra∣cious;
whose law is the plan of our
happiness. But this Benefactor, is the
<HI>King eternal, immortal, and invisible;</HI> at
whose presence, the mountains shake,
and Nature trembles. <HI>Every good, and
every perfect gift come down from him.</HI>
But the hand which confers them, we
cannot see. Mysterious obscurity rests
upon his essence. He dwelleth <HI>in the se∣cret
place of thunder;</HI> and clouds and
darkness surround him. He is the
<HI>Hearer of prayer;</HI> but we lift our voice
to him from afar. Into his immediate
presence no access is permitted. Our
warmest devotion admits no familiarity
with him. <HI>God is in heaven, and then
upon earth; therefore, let thy words be
<PB N="423" REF="432"/>
few.</HI> If his omniscience administers com∣fort
in our secret distress, it likewise fills
with awe, the heart that is conscious of
guilt. For, if he <HI>knows our frame, and
remembers we are dust; our iniquities,</HI> also,
<HI>are ever before him; our secret sins, in the
light of his countenance.</HI></P>
<P>Throughout all his dispensations, great∣ness,
in conjunction with goodness, strikes
our view; and, wherever we behold the
Parent, we behold the Legislator also. The
death of Christ, in the behalf of a guilty
world, is the chief ground of religious
hope and joy. But it is no less the
ground of reverence; when, in this high
transaction, we contemplate God, as at
once strict in justice, and great in mercy.
<HI>I the Lord keep mercy for thousands of them
that fear me. I forgive their iniquity, trans∣gression,
and sin; but I will by no means
clear the guilty.</HI> When we open the book
of the Law, we find promises and threat∣enings
mingled in the same page. On
the one side, we see Heaven displayed
in all its glory: On the other, Hell
<PB N="424" REF="433"/>
opening its terrours. In short, in what∣ever
light we view religion, it appear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
solemn and venerable. It is a temple
full of majesty, to which the worshippers
may approach with comfort, in the hope
of <HI>obtaining grace, and finding mercy;</HI> but
where they cannot enter, without being
impressed with awe. If we may be per∣mitted
to compare spiritual with natural
things, religion resembles not those scenes
of natural beauty, where every object
smiles. It cannot be likened to the gay
landscape, or the flowery field. It re∣sembles
more the august and sublime ap∣pearances
of Nature; the lofty mountain,
the expanded ocean, and the starry firma∣ment;
at the sight of which, the mind
is at once over-awed and delighted; and,
from the union of grandeur with beau∣ty,
derives a pleasing, but a serious, emo∣tion.</P>
<P>IN the second place, As joy, tempered
by fear, suits the nature of religion, so,
it is requisite for the proper regulation of
<PB N="425" REF="434"/>
the conduct of man. Let his joy flow
from the best and purest source; yet, if it
remain long unmixed, it is apt to become
dangerous to virtue. As waters which
are never stirred, nor troubled, gather a
sediment, which putrifies them; so, the
undisturbed continuance of placid sensa∣tions,
engenders disorders in the human
soul. It is wisely ordered in our present
state, that joy and fear, hope and grief,
should act alternately, as checks and ba∣lances
upon each other, in order to pre∣vent
an excess in any of them, which
our nature could not bear. If we were
subject to no alarms of danger, the
wisest would soon become improvident;
and the most humble, presumptuous.
Man is a pilgrim on earth. Were his
path to be always smooth and flowery,
he would be tempted to relinquish his
guide, and to forget the purpose of his
journey. Caution and fear, are the
shields of happiness. Unguarded joy
begets indolence; indolence produces se∣curity;
security leads to rashness; and
<PB N="426" REF="435"/>
rashness ends in ruin. In order to re∣joice
long, it is necessary that we <HI>rejoice
with trembling.</HI> Had our first parents
observed this rule, man might have been
still in Paradise. He who faith in his
heart, <HI>My mountain stands strong; I shall
never be moved;</HI> may be assured that his
state already begins to totter. Religion,
therefore, performs a kind office, in giv∣ing
us the admonition of the Text. It
inspires chearfulness in the service of
God. It proposes joy, as our chief spring
of action. But it supports joy, by guard∣ing
it with fear; not suppressing, but
regulating its indulgence; requiring us
to rejoice, like persons who have obtained
a treasture, which, through want of vigi∣lance,
they are exposed to lose. De∣pendent
beings are formed for submis∣sion;
and, to submit, is to stand in awe.
<HI>Because the Lord reigneth, let the earth be
glad.</HI> We are the subjects of God; and
therefore may justly rejoice. But still we
are subjects; and, therefore, trembling
must mix with our joy.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="436"/>
IN the third place, the unstable condi∣tion
of all human things, naturally in∣spires
fear in the mids;t of joy. The
spirit to which religion forms us, must
undoubtedly, correspond to the state in
which we are placed, and to the part
which is assigned us to act. Now, the
first view under which our present state
appears, is that of fallen creatures, who
are undergoing, in this world, probation
and trial for their recovery; and are com∣manded
to <HI>work out their salvation with
fear and trembling.</HI> This view of our
condition, infers not habitual dejection
of mind. It requires not melancholy
abstraction from the affairs, or total con∣tempt
of the amusements, of life. But it
inspires humility. It enforces dependance
on Divine aid; and calls forth the voice
of supplication to Heaven. In a situation
so critical, and where interests so import∣ant
are at stake, every reasonable person
must confess, that seriousness ought to
temper rejoicing.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="437"/>
Were there in human life any fixed
point of stability and rest, attainable by
man; could we, at any one moment, as∣sure
ourselves, that there remained no la∣tent
source of danger, either to our tem∣poral,
or our spiritual state; then, I ad∣mit,
we might lay trembling aside, and
rejoice in full security. But, alas! no
such safe station, no such moment of
confidence, is allowed to man during his
warfare on earth. Vicissitudes of good
and evil, of trials and consolations, fill
up his life. The best intentioned, are
sometimes betrayed into crimes; the most
prudent, overwhelmed with misfortunes.
The world is like a wheel incessantly re∣volving,
on which human things alter∣nately
rise and fall. What is past of our
life, has been a checquered scene. On its
remaining periods, uncertainty and dark∣ness
rest. Futurity is an unknown re∣gion,
into which no man can look for∣ward
without awe, because he cannot tell
what forms of danger, or trial, may meet
him there. This we know well, that, in
<PB N="429" REF="438"/>
every period of our life, the path of hap∣piness
shall be found steep and arduous;
but swift and easy, the descent to ruin.
What, with much exertion of care and
vigilance, we had built up, one unwary
action may, in an evil hour, overthrow.
The props of human confidence are, in
general, insecure. The sphere of human
pleasures is narrow. While we form
schemes, for strengthening the one, and
for enlarging the other, death, in the
mean-while, advances. Life, with a swift,
though insensible course, glides away;
and, like a river which undermines its
banks, gradually impairs our state. Year
after year, steals something from us; till
the decaying fabrick totter of itself, and
crumble at length into dust. So that,
whether we consider life or death, time
or eternity, all things appear to concur
in giving to man the admonition of the
Text, <HI>Rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now shown, in what respects
religion both promotes joy, and inspires
<PB N="430" REF="439"/>
seriousness. It places us in the most fa∣vourable
situation, which human life af∣fords,
for joy; and it gives us every as∣sistance,
for relishing that joy. It reanders
it our duty, to cultivate the satisfaction
which it yields. It demands a chearful
spirit, in order to ascertain the sincerity
of our principles, and to confirm us in
good practice. At the same time, the
joy which it inspires, is tempered with
fear, by the genius of religion itself,
by the dangers to which unguarded joy
would expose us, and by the impropriety
of indulging it, in a situation so mixed as
the present. The <HI>trembling</HI> which is here
enjoined, is not to be understood as sig∣nifying
a pusillanimous dejection. It im∣ports
no more than that caution and so∣briety,
which prudence dictates, as be∣longing
to our state. By connecting such
trembling with our joy, religion means
to recommend to us, a chearful, but a
composed, spirit; equally remote from
the humiliating depression of fear, and
the exulting levity of joy. Always to re∣joice,
<PB N="431" REF="440"/>
is to be a fool. Always to tremble,
is to be a slave. It is a modest chearful∣ness,
a chastened joy, a manly seriousness,
which becomes the servant of God.</P>
<P>BUT is this, it may perhaps be said,
the whole amount of that boasted satis∣faction
which religion bestows? Is this
all the compensation which it makes, for
those sacrifices it exacts? Are not the
terms which vice holds out, far moreenticing,
when it permits us to gratify
every desire; and, in return for our sur∣mounting
the timorous scruples of con∣science,
promises us a life of gaiety, fe∣stivity,
and unrestrained joy?—Such
promises, vice may indeed make; but,
how far it fulfils them, we may safely
refer to the determination of the greatest
sensualist, when he has finished his ca∣reer,
and looks back on what he has en∣joyed.
Ask him, Whether he would re∣commend
to his children, and his friends,
to hold the same course; and whether,
with his dying breath, he dare assure
<PB N="432" REF="441"/>
them, that the gratifications of licenti∣ousness
afford the greatest enjoyment of
life? Whatever hopes vice may at the
beginning inspire, yet, after the trial is
made, it has been always found, that
criminal pleasures are the bane of happi∣ness;
the poison, not the cordial, of our
present state. They are pleasures, com∣pensated
by an infinite overbalance of
pain; moments of delight, succeeded by
years of regret; purchased at the expence
of injured reputation, broken health, and
ruined peace. Even abstracting from
their pernicious consequences, they are,
for most part, in themselves treacherous
pleasures; unsound, and disturbed in the
moments of enjoyment. <HI>In the midst of
such laughter, the heart is sorrowful.</HI> Of∣ten
is the smile of gaiety assumed, while
the heart akes within: And though folly
laughs, guilt will sting. Correcting this
pernicious phrenzy of pleasure, and re∣ducing
it to a more sober and regulated
state, religion is, in truth, no other than
wisdom, introducing peace and order into
the life of man.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="442"/>
While religion condemns such plea∣sures
as are immoral, it is chargeable
with no improper austerity, in respect of
those▪ which are of an innocent kind.
Think not, that by the cautious disci∣pline
which it prescribes, it excludes you
from all gay enjoyment of life. With∣in
the compass of that sedate spirit, to
which it forms you, all that is innocent∣ly
pleasing will be found to lie. It is a
mistake to imagine, that, in constant ef∣fusions
of giddy mirth, or in that flut∣ter
of spirits which is excited by a round
of diversions, the chief enjoyment of our
state consists. Were this the case, the
vain and the frivolous would be on bet∣ter
terms for happiness, than the wise,
the great, and the good. To arrange
the plans of amusement, or to preside in
the haunts of jollity, would be more de∣sirable,
than to exert the highest effort of
mental powers for the benefit of na∣tions.
A consequence so absurd, is suffi∣cient
to explode the principle from which
it flows. To the amusements and lesser
<PB N="434" REF="443"/>
joys of the world, religion assigns their
proper place. It admits of them, as relax∣ations
from care, as instruments of pro∣moting
the union of men, and of enliven∣ing
their social intercourse. But though,
as long as they are kept within due bounds,
it does not censure nor condemn them;
neither does it propose them, as rewards
to the virtuous, or as the principal ob∣jects
of their pursuit. To such, it points
out nobler ends of action. Their felicity
it engages them to seek, in the discharge
of an useful, an upright, and honourable
part in life; and, as the habitual tenour
of their mind, it promotes chearfulness,
and discourages levity.</P>
<P>Between these two, there is a wide di∣stinction;
and the mind which is most
open to levity, is frequently a stranger to
chearfulness. It has been remarked, that
transports of intemperate mirth, are of∣ten
no more than flashes from the dark
cloud; and that, in proportion to the vio∣lence
of the effulgence, such is the suc∣ceeding
gloom. Levity, may be the for∣ced
<PB N="435" REF="444"/>
production of folly or vice; chear∣fulness,
is the natural offspring of wis∣dom
and virtue only. The one is an oc∣casional
agitation; the other, a perma∣nent
habit. The one degrades the cha∣racter;
the other, is perfectly consistent
with the dignity of reason, and the
steady and manly spirit of religion. To
aim at a constant succession of high and
vivid sensations of pleasure, is an idea of
happiness altogether chimerical. Calm
and temperate enjoyment, is the utmost
that is allotted to man. Beyond this, we
struggle in vain to raise our state; and, in
fact, depress our joys, by endeavouring
to heighten them. Instead of those vain
hopes of perpetual festivity, with which
the world would allure us, religion con∣fers
upon us, a chearful tranquillity. In∣stead
of dazzling us with meteors of joy,
which sparkle and expire, it sheds around
us, a calm and steady light. By mixing
trembling with our joy, it renders that
joy more solid, more equal, and more
lasting.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="445"/>
In this spirit, then, let us serve God,
and hold our course through life. Let
us approach to the Divine Being, as to
a sovereign of whom we stand in awe,
and to a father in whom we trust. In
our conduct, let us be cautious and hum∣ble,
as those who have ground to fear;
well pleasled and chearful, as those who
have cause to rejoice. Let us show the
world, that a religious temper, is a tem∣per,
sedate, not sad; that a religious be∣haviour,
is a behaviour, regulated, not
stiff and formal. Thus, we shall <HI>use the
world, as not abusing it;</HI> we shall pass
through its various changes, with the
least discomposure; and we shall vindi∣cate
religion, from the reproaches of those
who would attribute to it, either enthusi∣astick
joys, or slavish terrours. We shall
show, that it is a rational rule of life,
worthy of the perfection of God, and
suited to the nature and state of man.</P>

<P>DISCONTENT is the most general of<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE>
all the evils which trouble the life
of man. It is a disease, which every∣where
finds materials to feed itself; for,
if real distresses be wanting, it substitutes
such as are imaginary in their place. It
converts even the good things of the
world, when they have been long enjoy∣ed,
into occasions of disgust. In the
midst of prosperity, it disposes us to com∣plain;
and renders tranquillity tiresome,
<PB N="438" REF="447"/>
only because it is uniform. There is no
wonder, that this spirit of restlessness and
dissatisfaction, which corrupts every ter∣restrial
enjoyment, should have sometimes
penetrated into the region of virtue.
Good men are not without their frailties;
and the perverseness incident to human
nature, too readily leads us, who weary
of all other things, to <HI>weary,</HI> also, <HI>in
well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>Let me put a case, which, perhaps,
will be found not unfrequent in ordinary
life. Suppose a person, after much com∣merce
with the world, to be convinced of
its vanity. He has seen its most flat∣tering
hopes to be fallacious. He has felt
its most boasted pleasures to be unsa∣tisfactory.
He resolves, therefore, to
place his happiness in virtue; and, dis∣regarding
all temptations from interest,
to adhere to what is right and honour∣able
in conduct. He cultivates acquaint∣ance
with religion. He performs, with
seriousness, the offices of devotion. He
lays down to himself, a rational and
<PB N="439" REF="448"/>
useful plan of life; and, with satisfac∣tion,
holds on for a while in this reform∣ed
course. But, by degrees, discourage∣ments
arise. The peace which he hoped
to enjoy, is interrupted, either by his
own frailties, or by the vices of others.
Passions, which had not been thoroughly
subdued, struggle for their accustomed
gratification. The pleasure which he ex∣pected
to find in devotion, sometimes
fails him; and the injustice of the world,
often sours and frets him. Friends prove
ungrateful; enemies misrepresent, rivals
supplant him: And part, at least, of the
mortifications which he suffers, he begins
to ascribe to virtue.—Is this all the re∣ward
of my serving God, and renouncing
the pleasures of sin? <HI>Verily, in vain, I
have cleansed my heart, and washed my
hands in innocency. Behold, the ungodly
prosper in the world, and have more than
heart can wish; while, all the day long,
I am plagued and chastened every morning.</HI>—
To such persons as these, and to all who
are in hazarda of being infected with their
<PB N="440" REF="449"/>
spirit, I now address myself. In reply to
their complaints, I purpose to show, That
in no state they can choose on earth, by
no plan of conduct they can form, is it
possible for them to escape uneasiness and
disappointment; that in a life of virtue,
they will suffer less uneasiness and fewer
disappointments, than in a course of vice;
they will possess much higher resources
and advantages; and they will be as∣sured
of complete reward at the end.
From these considerations, I hope to make
it appear, that there is no sufficient rea∣son
for our <HI>wearying in well-doing;</HI> and
that, taking human life upon the whole,
virtue is by far the most eligible portion
of man.</P>
<P>I. Uneasiness and disappointment, are
inseparable, in some degree, from every
state on earth. Were it in the power of
the world, to render those who attach
themselves to it, satisfied and happy, you
might then, I admit, have some title to
complain, if you found yourselves placed
<PB N="441" REF="450"/>
upon worse terms in the service of God.
But this is so far from being the case,
that, among the multitudes who devote
themselves to earthly pleasure, you will
not find a single person who has com∣pletely
attained his aim. Enquire into
the condition of the high and the low,
of the gay and the serious, of the men of
business and the men of pleasure, and
you shall behold them all occupied, in
supplying some want, or in removing
some distress. No man is pleased with
being precisely what he is. Every-where
there is a void; generally, even in the
most prosperous life, there is some corner
possessed by sorrow. He who is engaged in
business, pines for leisure. He who en∣joys
leisure, languishes for want of em∣ployment.
In a single state, we envy the
comforts of a family. In conjugal life,
we are chagrined with domestick cares.
In a safe station, we regret the want of
objects for enterprise. In an enterprizing
life, we lament the want of safety. It is
the doom of man, that his sky should
<PB N="442" REF="451"/>
never be free from all clouds. He is, at
present, in an exiled and fallen state.
The objects which surround him, are be∣neath
his native dignity. God has tin∣ged
them all with vanity, on purpose to
make him feel, that this is not his rest;
that here he is not in his proper place,
nor arrived at his true home.</P>
<P>If, therefore, you aim at a condition
which shall be exempted from every dis∣quiet,
you pursue a phantom; you in∣crease
the vanity and vexation of life, by
engaging in a chace so fruitless. If you
complain of virtue, because there is inci∣dent
to it a portion of that uneasiness
which is found in every other state, your
complaint is most unreasonable. You
claim an immunity from evil, which be∣longs
not to the lot of man. Recon∣cile
yourselves, then, to your condition;
and, instead of looking for perfect hap∣piness
any where on earth, gladly embrace
that state which contains the fewest sor∣rows.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="452"/>
II. THOUGH no condition of human
life is free from uneasiness, I contend,
that the uneasiness belonging to a sinful
course, is far greater, than what attends a
course of well-doing. If you weary of
the labours of virtue, be assured that the
world, whenever you try the exchange,
will lay upon you a much heavier load. It
is the outside, only, of a licentious life,
which is gay and smiling. Within, it con∣ceals
toil, and trouble, and deadly sorrow.
For, vice poisons human happiness in the
spring, by introducing disorder into the
heart. Those passions which it seems to
indulge, it only feeds with imperfect
gratifications; and thereby strengthens
them for preying, in the end, on their
unhappy victims.</P>
<P>It is a great mistake to imagine, that
the pain of self-denial is confined to vir∣tue.
He who follows the world, as much
as he who follows Christ, must <HI>take up his
cross;</HI> and to him, assuredly, it will prove
a more oppressive burden. Vice allows all
our passions to range uncontrouled; and
<PB N="444" REF="453"/>
where each claims to be superiour, it is
impossible to gratify all. The predomi∣nant
desire, can only be indulged at the
expence of its rival. No mortifications
which virtue exacts, are more severe than
those, which ambition imposes upon the
love of ease, pride upon interest, and
covetousness upon vanity. Self-denial,
therefore, belongs, in common, to vice
and virtue; but with this remarkable
difference, that the passions which virtue
requires us to mortify, it tends to wea∣ken;
whereas, those which vice obliges
us to deny, it, at the same time, strength∣ens.
The one diminishes the pain of
self-denial, by moderating the demands
of passion; the other increases it, by ren∣dering
those demands imperious and vio∣lent.
—What distresses, that occur in the
calm life of virtue, can be compared to
those tortures, which remorse of consci∣ence
inflicts on the wicked; to those
severe humiliations, arising from guilt
combined with misfortunes, which sink
them to the dust; to those violent agita∣tions
<PB N="445" REF="454"/>
of shame and disappointment,
which sometimes drive them to the most
fatal extremities, and make them abhor
their existence? How often, in the midst
of those disastrous situations, into which
their crimes have brought them, have
they cursed the seductions of vice; and,
with bitter regret, looked back to the day
on which they first forsook the path of
innocence!</P>
<P>But, perhaps, you imagine, that to such
miseries as these, great criminals only are
exposed; and that, by a wary and cautious
management, it is possible to avoid them.
Take vice and virtue, then, in the most
general point of view. Compare God and
the world as two masters, the one or other
of whom you must obey; and consider
fairly, in whose service there will be rea∣son
for your wearying soonest, and repent∣ing
most frequently. The world is both
a hard, and a capricious master. To sub∣mit
to a long servitude, in the view of a
recompense from which they are excluded,
in the end, is known to be often, the fate
<PB N="446" REF="455"/>
of those, who are devoted to the world.
They sacrifice their present ease, to their
future prospects. They court the great,
and flatter the multitude. They prosti∣tute
their conscience, and dishonour their
character: And, after all their efforts, how
uncertain is their success! Competitors
justle, and outstrip them. The more art∣ful
deceive, the more violent overthrow
them. Fair prospects once smiled; but
clouds soon gather; the sky is darkened;
the scene changes; and that fickle world,
which, a moment before, had flattered,
the next moment, forgets them.</P>
<P>God is never mistaken in the character
of his servants; for he <HI>seeth their hearts,
and judgeth according to the truth.</HI> But
the world is often deceived in those who
court its favour; and, of course, is unjust
in the distribution of its rewards. Flattery
gains the ear of power. Fraud supplants
innocence; and the pretending and as∣suming,
occupy the place of the worthy
and the modest. In vain you claim any
merit with the world, on account of your
<PB N="447" REF="456"/>
good intentions. The world, knows them
not; regards them not. It judges of you,
solely by your actions; and, what is
worse, by the success of your actions,
which often depends not on yourselves.
But, in the sight of the Supreme Being,
good intentions supply the place of good,
deeds, which you had not the opportu∣nity
of performing. The well-meant en∣deavours
of the poor, find the same ac∣ceptance
with him, as the generous ac∣tions
of the rich. The <HI>widow's mite</HI> is,
in his eye, a costly offering; and even he
<HI>who giveth to a disciple a cup of cold water,</HI>
when he can give him no more, <HI>goeth not
without his reward.</HI></P>
<P>As the world is unjust in its judgments,
so it is ungrateful in its requitals. Time
speedily effaces the memory of the greatest
services; and when we can repeat them
no more, we are neglected, and thrown
aside. It was the saying of a noted great
man of the world, on the fall of his
fortunes, “Had I served God, as faith∣fully
as I have done my King, he
<PB N="448" REF="457"/>
would not have cast me off in my old
age Unfaithfuln”ss, and ingratitude,
are unknown to God. With him, no
new favourites arise, to usurp the place, or
to bear off the rewards of his antient ser∣vants.
<HI>Even to your old age, I am He; and
even to hoary hairs, I will carry you. I have
made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
and will deliver you, saith the Lord Al∣mighty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. xlvi. 4.</NOTE>.
—Since, then, in our several de∣partments,
we must labour, What com∣parison
is there, between labouring for
God, and for the world? How unjust are
they, who weary so much sooner in the
service of God, than they do in that of the
most severe, and imperious of all masters!</P>
<P>III. THE resources of virtue, are much
greater, than those of the world; the com∣pensations
which it makes for our distres∣ses,
far more valuable. Perpetual success
belongs neither to the one, nor the other.
But under disappointments, when they
occur, virtue bears us up; the world al∣lows
us to sink. When the mind of a
<PB N="449" REF="458"/>
good man is hurt by misfortunes, reli∣gion
administers the cordial, and infuses
the balm. Whereas, the world inflicts
wounds,, and then leaves them to fester.
It brings sorrows, but it provides no con∣solation.
Consolation is entirely the pro∣vince
of religion. Supposing religion to
be inferiour to vice in external advan∣tages,
it must be allowed to possess inter∣nal
peace, in a much higher degree. This
is so certain, that almost all men, at some
period or other of their life, look forward
to it, as to a desirable retreat. When the
ends of their present pursuit shall be
accomplished, they propose to themselves
much satisfaction in an honourable dis∣charge
of the duties of their station,
amidst those moderate passions, and tem∣perate
pleasures, which innocence allows.
That which all men agree in holding to
be second in importance to the pursuit
which they follow, may be safely esteem∣ed
to be the first in real worth; and it
may be concluded, that if they were not
<PB N="450" REF="459"/>
blinded by some prevailing; passion, they
would discern and adopt it as such.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar effect of virtue, to
make a man's chief happiness arise from
himself, and his own conduct. A bad
man is wholly the creature of the world.
He hangs upon its favour, lives by its
smiles, and is happy or miserable, in pro∣portion
to his success. But to a virtuous
man, success in worldly undertakings i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but a secondary object. To discharge his
own part with integrity and honour, is
his chief aim. If he has done properly
what was incumbent on him to do, his
mind is at rest; to Providence he leaves
the event. <HI>His witness is in heaven, and
his record is on high.</HI> Satisfied with the
approbation of God, and the testimony
of a good conscience, he enjoys himself,
and despises the triumphs of guilt. In
proportion as such manly principles rule
your heart, you will become independent
of the world; and will forbear complain∣ing
of idliscouragements. It is the im∣perfection
of your virtue, which occasions
<PB N="451" REF="460"/>
you to <HI>weary in well-doing.</HI> It is because
your hearts remain divided between God
and the world, that you are so often dis∣contented;
partly wishing to discharge
your duty, and partly seeking your happi∣ness
from somewhat that is repugnant to
your duty. Study to be more consistent in
principle, and more uniform in practice,
and your peace will be more unbroken.</P>
<P>Though virtue may appear at first sight
to contract the bounds of enjoyment, you
will find, upon reflection, that, in truth, it
enlarges them. If it restrains the excess
of some pleasures, it favours and increases
others. It precludes you from none, but
such as are either fantastick and ima∣ginary,
or pernicious and destructive.
Whatever is truly valuable in human en∣joyment,
it allows to a good man, no less
than to others. It not only allows him
such pleasures, but heightens them, by
that grateful relish which a good con∣science
gives to every pleasure. It not
only heightens them, but adds to them
also the peculiar satisfactions which flow
<PB N="452" REF="461"/>
from virtuous sentiments, from devour
affections, and religious hopes. On how
much worse terms is the sinner placed,
in the midst of his boasted gratifications?
His portion is confined to this world.
His good things are all of one sort only;
he has neither knowledge, nor relish, of
any thing beyond them. His enjoyment,
therefore, rests on a much narrower basis,
than that of the servants of God. En∣large,
as much as you please, the circle of
worldly gratifications; yet, if nothing of
the mind and the heart, nothing of a re∣fined
and moral nature, enter into that
circle, and vary the enjoyment, languor
and weariness soon succeed. Among
whom do you hear more peevish expres∣sions
of discontent, or more frequent
complaints of low spirits, than among
the professed votaries of worldly pleasure?</P>
<P>Vice and virtue, in their progress, as in
every other respect, hold an opposite
course. The beginnings of vice are en∣ticing.
The first steps of worldly ad∣vancement,
are flattering and pleasing.
<PB N="453" REF="462"/>
But the continuance of success, blunts
enjoyment, and flattens desire. Whereas,
the beginnings of virtue are laborious.
But, by perseverance its labours dimi∣nish,
and its pleasures increase. As it
ripens into confirmed habit, it becomes
both smoother in practice, and more com∣plete
in its reward. In a worldly life, the
termination of our hopes always meets our
view. We see a boundary before us, be∣yond
which we cannot reach. But the
prospects of virtue, are growing, and
endless. <HI>The righteous shall hold on in his
way; and he that hath clean hands, shall
wax stronger and stronger. The path of the
just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> This
brings me to consider,</P>
<P>IV. THE assured hope, which good
men enjoy, of a full reward at last. I
have endeavoured, by several considera∣tions,
to correct your impatience under
the present discouragements of virtue.
I have shown many high advantages,
<PB N="454" REF="463"/>
which it already possesses. But now,
laying all these aside; supposing virtue to
have brought you no advantage, but to
have only engaged you in perpetual
struggles with an evil world; the Text
suggests what is sufficient to answer eve∣ry
objection, and to silence every com∣plaint;
<HI>in due season you shall reap, if
you faint not.</HI> It is not a loose encourage∣ment,
or a dubious hope, which is held
forth to us. A direct and explicit decla∣ration
is made by the Spirit of God, that
piety and virtue, how discouraged soever,
or oppressed, they may be for a while,
shall not be frustrated of their reward;
but, that <HI>in due season,</HI> when the period
which is fixed by the Divine decree shall
come, all who <HI>weary not in well-doing,</HI>
though they may <HI>have sown in tears, shall
reap in joy.</HI> As this great principle of
faith, is so essential to our present argu∣ment,
and is indeed the foundation of
all religion, it will be proper that we
now take a view of the grounds on which
<PB N="455" REF="464"/>
it rests. By fixing our attention, both
on the proofs which, reason suggests, and
the discoveries which revelation has made,
of a state of future rewards, we shall take
an effectual method of confirming our
adherence to religion; and of baffling
those temptations which might lead us
to <HI>weary in well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>THE first, and most obvious pres mp∣tion,
which reason affords in behalf of
future rewards to the righteous, arises
from the imperfect distribution of good
and evil in our present state. Notwith∣standing
what I have advanced con∣cerning
the pleasures and advantages of
virtue, it cannot be denied, that the hap∣piness
of good men is often left incom∣plete.
The vitious possess advantages, to
which they have no right; while the
conscientious suffer for the sake of virtue,
and groan under distresses which they
have not merited from the world. In∣deed,
were the distribution of good and
evil, in this life, altogether promiscuous;
<PB N="456" REF="465"/>
could it be said, with truth, that the
moral condition of men had no influence
whatever upon their happiness or misery;
I admit, that from such a state of things,
no presumption would arise, of any future
retribution being intended. They who
delight to aggravate the miseries of life,
and the distresses of virtue, do no service
to the argument in behalf of Providence.
For, if total disorder be found to prevail
now, suspicions may, too justly, arise, of
its prevailing for ever. If he who rules
the universe, entirely neglects virtue here,
the probability must be small, of his re∣warding
it hereafter. But this is far
from being the true state of the fact.
What human life presents to the view
of an impartial observer, is by no means
a scene of entire confusion; but a state of
order, begun, and carried on a certain
length. Virtue is so far from being ne∣glected
by the Governour of the world,
that from many evident marks, it ap∣pears
to be a chief object of his care.
In the constitution of human nature, a
<PB N="457" REF="466"/>
foundation is laid, for comfort to the
righteous, and for internal punishment to
the wicked. Throughout the course of
the Divine government, tendencies to∣wards
the happiness of the one, and the
misery of the other, constantly appear.
They are so conspicuous, as not to have
escaped the notice of the rudest nations.
Over the whole earth, they have diffused
the belief, that Providence is propitious
to virtue, and adverse to guilt. Yet these
tendencies are, sometimes, disappointed
of their effect; and that which Provi∣dence
visibly favours, is left, at present,
without an adequate reward.</P>
<P>From such an imperfect distribution of
happiness, what are we to conclude, but
that this system is the beginning, not the
whole of things; the opening only of a
more extensive plan, whose consumma∣tion
reaches into a future world? If God
has already <HI>set his throne for judgement:</HI>
if he has visibly begun to reward and
to punish, in some degree, on earth, he
cannot mean to leave the exercise of go∣vernment
<PB N="458" REF="467"/>
incomplete. Having laid the
foundation of a great and noble struc∣ture,
he will in due time rear it up to
perfection. The unfinished parts of the
fabrick, evidently show, that a future
building is intended. All his other works
are constructed according to the most full
and exact proportion. In the natural
world, nothing is deficient, nothing re∣dundant.
It is in the moral world, only,
that we discover irregularity and defect.
It falls short of that order and perfection
which appear in the rest of the creation.
It exhibits not, in its present state, the
same features of complete wisdom, jus∣tice,
or goodness. But can we believe,
that under the government of the Supreme
Being, those apparent disorders shall not
be rectified at the last? Or, that from
his conduct towards his rational creatures,
the chief of his works, the sole objec∣tion
against his perfection shall rise, and
be allowed to subsist for ever?</P>
<P>On the supposition of future rewards
and punishments, a satisfying account
<PB N="459" REF="468"/>
can be given, of all the disorders which
at present take place on earth. Christia∣nity
explains their origin, and traces
them to their issue. Man, fallen from
his primaeval felicity, is now undergoing
probation and discipline for his final
state. Divine justice remains, for a sea∣son,
concealed; and allows men to act
their parts with freedom on this theatre,
that their characters may be formed and
ascertained. Amidst discouragements and
afflictions, the righteous give proof of
their fidelity, and acquire the habits of
virtue. But, if you suppose the events
of this life to have no reference to an∣other,
the whole state of man becomes,
not only inexplicable, but contradictory,
and inconsistent. The powers of the in∣feriour
animals, are perfectly suited to their
station. They know nothing higher than
their present condition. In gratifying
their appetites, they fulfill their destiny,
and pass away. Man, alone, comes forth
to act a part, which carries no meaning,
and tends to no end. Endowed with ca∣pacities,
<PB N="460" REF="469"/>
which extend far beyond his
present sphere; fitted by his rational na∣ture,
for running the race of immorta∣lity,
he is stopped short in the very en∣trance
of his course. He squanders his
activity on pursuits, which he discerns to
be vain. He languishes for knowledge,
which is placed beyond his reach. He
thirsts after a happiness, which he is
doomed never to enjoy. He sees, and
laments, the disasters of his state; and
yet, upon this supposition, can find no∣thing
to remedy them.—Has the eternal
God any pleasure in sporting himself
with such a scene of misery and folly, as
this life, if it had no connexion with an∣other,
must exhibit to his eye? Did he
call into existence this magnificent uni∣verse,
adorn it with so much beauty and
splendour, and surround it with those
glorious luminaries which we behold in
the heavens, only that some generations of
mortal men might arise to behold these
wonders, and then disappear for ever?
How unsuitable, in this case, were the
<PB N="461" REF="470"/>
habitation to the wretched inhabitant?
How inconsistent the commencement of
his being, and the mighty preparation of
his powers and faculties, with his despi∣cable
end? How contradictory, in fine,
were every thing which concerns the
state of man, to the wisdom and perfec∣tion
of his Maker?</P>
<P>Throughout all ages, and among all
nations, the persuasion of a future life
has prevailed. It sprung not from the
refinements of science, or the specula∣tions
of philosophy; but from a deeper
and stronger root, the natural sentiments
of the human heart. Hence it is common
to the philosopher, and the savage; and is
found in the most barbarous, as well as
in the most civilized, regions. Even the
belief of the being of a God, is not more
general on the earth, than the belief of
immortality. Dark indeed, and confused,
were the notions which men entertained
concerning a future state. Yet still, in
that state, they looked for retribution,
both to the good, and the bad; and in
<PB N="462" REF="471"/>
the perfection of such pleasures, as they
knew best, and valued most highly, they
placed the rewards of the virtuous. So
universal a consent seems plainly to in∣dicate,
an original determination given
to the soul by its Creator. It shows this
great truth, to be native and congenial
to man.</P>
<P>When we look into our own breasts,
we find various anticipations and pre∣sages
of future existence. Most of our
great and high passions, extend beyond
the limits of this life. The ambitious and
the self-denied, the great, the good, and
the wicked, all take interest, in what is
to happen after they shall have left the
earth. That passion for fame, which in∣spires
so much of the activity of mankind,
plainly is animated by the persuasion,
that consciousness is to survive the dis∣solution
of the body. The virtuous are
supported by the hope, the guilty tor∣mented
with the dread, of what is to take
place after death. As death approaches,
the hopes of the one, and the fears of the
<PB N="463" REF="472"/>
other, are found to redouble. The soul,
when issuing hence, seems more clearly
to discern its future abode. All the
operations of conscience, proceed upon
the belief of immortality. The whole
moral conduct of men refers to it. All
legislators have supposed it. All religions
are built upon it. It is so essential to
the order of society, that were it eras∣ed,
human laws would prove ineffectual
restraints from evil, and a deluge of
crimes and miseries would overflow the
the earth. To suppose this universal and
powerful belief to be without foundation
in truth, is to suppose, that a principle
of delusion was interwoven with the
nature of man; is to suppose, that his
Creator was reduced to the necessity of
impressing his heart with a falsehood, in
order to make him answer die purposes of
his being.</P>
<P>BUT though these arguments be strong,
yet all argum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts are liable to objection.
Perhaps this general belief, of which I have
<PB N="464" REF="473"/>
spoken, has been owing to inclination
and desire, more than to evidence. Per∣haps,
in our reasonings on this subject
from the Divine perfections, we flatter
ourselves with being of more conse∣quence
than we truly are, in the system
of the universe. Hence the great impor∣tance
of a discovery proceeding from
God himself, which gives full authority
to all that reason had suggested, and
places this capital truth beyond the reach
of suspicion or distrust.</P>
<P>The method which Christianity has
taken, to convey to us the evidence of a
future state, highly deserves our atten∣tion.
Had the Gospel been addressed, like
a system of philosophy, solely to the un∣derstanding
of men; had it aimed only at
enlightening the studious and reflecting,
it would have confined itself to abstract
truth; it would have simply informed us,
that the righteous are hereafter to be re∣warded,
and sinners to be punished. Such
a declaration as that contained in the
Text, would have been sufficient: <HI>Be not
<PB N="465" REF="474"/>
weary in well-doing; for in due season you
shall reap, if you saint not.</HI> But the Gos∣pel
has not stopped, at barely announcing
life and immortality to mankind. It was
calculated for popular edification. It was
intended to be the religion, not merely of
the few, whose understanding was to be
informed; but of the many, also, whose
imagination was to be impressed, and
whose passions were to be awakened, in
order to give the truth its due influence
over them. Upon this account, it not
only reveals the certainty of a future
state, but, in the person of the great
Founder of our religion, exhibits a series
of facts relating to it; by means of which,
our senses, our imagination, and passions,
all become interested in this great object.</P>
<P>The resurrection of Christ from the
grave, was designed to be a sensible evi∣dence,
that death infers not a final ex∣tinction
of the living principle. He rose,
in order to show, that, in our name, he
had conquered death, and was <HI>become the
first fruits of them that sleep.</HI> Nor did he
<PB N="466" REF="475"/>
only rise from the grave, but, by ascend∣ing
to heaven in a visible form, before
many witnesses, gave an ocular speci∣men
of the transition, from this world,
into the region of the blessed. The em∣ployments
which now occupy him there,
are fully declared. <HI>As our fore-runner,
he hath entered within the veil. He ap∣pears
in the presence of God for us. He
maketh perpetual intercession for his peo∣ple.
I go,</HI> said he, <HI>to my Father and your
father, to my God and your God. In my
Father's house are many mansions. I go to
prepare a place for you. I will come again,
and receive you to myself, that where I am,
there ye may be also.</HI> The circumstances
of his coming again, are distinctly fore∣told.
The sounding of the last trumpet,
the resurrection of the dead, the appear∣ance
of the Judge, and the solemnity
with which he shall discriminate the good
from the bad, are all described. The very
words in which he shall pronounce the
final sentence, are recited in our hearing:
<HI>Come, ye blessed of my Father! inherit the
<PB N="467" REF="476"/>
kingdom prepared for you, from the founda∣tion
of the world.</HI> Then shall the holy and
the just be <HI>caught up in the clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air.</HI> They shall enter with
him into the <HI>city of the living God.</HI> They
shall possess the new earth, and new hea∣vens,
wherein dwelleth righteousness. God
shall wipe away all tears front their eyes.
They shall behold his face in righteousness,
and be satisfied with his likeness for ever.—By
recording such a train of striking cir∣cumstances
and facts, the Gospel fami∣liarizes
us in some measure with a future
state. By accommodating this great dis∣covery,
in so useful a manner, to the
conceptions of men, it furnishes a strong
intrinsick evidence of its divine origin.</P>
<P>THUS, upon the whole, whether you
consult your reason, or listen to the dis∣coveries
of revelation, you behold our ar∣gument
confirmed; you behold a life of
piety and virtue, issuing in immortal fe∣licity.
Of what worldly pursuit can it be
pronounced, that its reward is certain?
<PB N="468" REF="477"/>
Look every where around you, and you
shall see, that <HI>the race is</HI> far from being
<HI>always to the swift, or the battle to the
strong.</HI> The most diligent, the most wise,
the most accomplished, may, after all
their labours, be disappointed in the end;
and be left to suffer the regret, of having
<HI>spent their strength for nought.</HI> But, for
the righteous, is <HI>laid up the crown of life.</HI>
Their final happiness is prepared in the
eternal plan of Providence, and secured
by the labours and sufferings of the
Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>Cease, then, from your unjust com∣plaints
against virtue and religion. Leave
discontent, and peevishness, to worldly
men. In no period of distress, in no mo∣ment
of disappointment, allow yourselves
to suspect, that piety and integrity are
fruitless. In every state of being, they
lead to happiness. If you enjoy not
at present their full rewards, it is, because
the season of recompence is not yet come.
For, <HI>in due season, you shall reap.</HI> There is
a time which is proper for reward; and
<PB N="469" REF="478"/>
there is a period which belongs to trial.
How long the one should last, and when
the other should arrive, belongs not to
you to determine. It is fixed by the
wise, though unknown, decree of the Al∣mighty.
But, be assured that <HI>He that
cometh, shall come, and will not tarry.</HI> He
shall come, <HI>in due season,</HI> to restore perfect
order among his works; to bring rest to
the weary, comfort to the afflicted, and just
retribution to all men. <HI>Behold, saith the
faithful and true Witness, I come quickly,
and my reward is with me. To him that
overecometh, will I give to eat of the tree of
life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
God. I will give him the morning star. I
will make him a pillar in my temple. He
shall be cloathed in white raiment; and
shall sit down with me on my throne</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 12.—ii. 7, 28.—iii. 12, 5, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
