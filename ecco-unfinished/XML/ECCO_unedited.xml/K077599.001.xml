<P>THOUGH the sources, from which the following
Papers have been drawn, are explained in the Intro∣duction,
it may not be improper to premise some facts for
the reader's more immediate information. These volumes
contain the papers of the family of Stuart and those of the
house of Brunswick Lunenburgh. The first consist of the
collection of Mr. Nairne, who was under-secretary, from the
Revolution to the end of the year 1713, to the ministers of
King James the Second, and to those of his son. The latter
comprehend the material part of the correspondence and
secret negotiations of the house of Hannover, their agents
and their friends in Britain, throughout the reign of
Queen Anne. The extracts from the life of King James
the Second, consisting of more than thirty sheets of print,
were partly taken by the late Mr. Thomas Carte, and
partly by the Editor, in a journey he made for that pur∣pose
to France. Mr. Nairne's papers came into the pos∣session
of Mr. Carte, some time before his death. To
these, the Editor, who had free access to such manu∣scripts
as lie open in the Scotch College at Paris, hath
added many valuable acquisitions of his own. The
ORIGINALS are now in the hands of the bookseller.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest part of mankind form their political opinions on
the usages of past times. With an excusable reverence for their
ancestors, they suffer rights derived from Nature to be decided by
precedent; and among many nations in Europe, the habit of submission to
arbitrary power is a sufficient argument for slavery. In this country
the supporters of the freedom of the people, and those who favour the
high prerogatives of the crown, make equally their appeal to antiquity,
and, with a kind of mutual consent, rest the justice of their respec∣tive
claims on the authority of former ages. Nothing, however, is more
ridiculous, than to suppose that freedom can be received as a legacy; or
that abject progenitors have any right to entail slavery on their po∣sterity.</P>
<P>This maxim, however, has seldom any weight with the great body of a
nation. The truth is, men are more safe in resting their claims on prece∣dents,
than in recurring perpetually to first principles. The authority of
facts is obvious, and understood by all. But few are capable of compre∣hending
that manly philosophy, which deems every government unjust
that is not free. To ascertain, therefore, the genuine circumstances of
former transactions; to redeem history from the misrepresentations of the
designing, the errors of the ignorant, and the weakness of the prejudiced;
to give to characters their genuine colour; to shew mankind, without
either fear or favour, as they were, is certainly deserving well of a people
who measure their public happiness and their political misery by the
standard of other times.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
The most free nations have oftener derived their liberty from accident,
than from a sense of the justice, which mankind owe to themselves. The
people of England, in particular, were least successful, when they made
their greatest efforts to be free. In their zeal to circumscribe the power
of the prince, they fell themselves into a state of humiliating slavery.
Men of more ability than principle sprung, as is usual, from anarchy
and civil discord. The first cause of contest was either forgot or neglect∣ed.
Demagogues, as might have been expected, started up into tyrants.
The nation lost its balance, in exerting its force against the crown; and
designing men had an interest in preventing the unwieldy body from reco∣vering
from its fall.</P>
<P>This new species of tyranny was not, however, destined to last long.
A despotism imposed, by either terror or force, required a continuance
of the same abilities by which it had been established. The engine which
Cromwell himself could scarce wield with ease, fell to pieces in the
feeble hands of his son. Anarchy succeeded, and threatened conse∣quences
of the worst kind. In the midst of the cabals and factions of
their leaders, the people remained in a melancholy suspence. They re∣membered
past miseries, they felt the present, they were anxious for the
future. A majority had been bent, by force, from their principles.
Some, disappointed in their hopes of freedom, others, in their schemes of
power became passive, concerning their political fate; and, by a train
of circumstances which human prudence could not have foreseen, the
nation reared, in a few months, the fabrick of government, which had
taken them so many years to destroy.</P>
<P>In the violence of the national joy, upon the restoration of monarchy,
men neglected to make such slipulations as might prevent future disputes
with the crown. This complaisant negligence became afterwards dan∣gerous
to the people, and it ruined the family of the prince. Things
being again set afloat, the storm arose. The memory of past miseries
prevented not future contests. A King without principle, and a faction
without patriotism, armed themselves against each other, with the pre∣judices
of the different parties, which still divided the nation. A victory,
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
on either side, must have ruined the balance of the constitution. No in∣termediate
choice seemed to have been left, between monarchical despo∣tism
and popular anarchy and confusion.</P>
<P>In this period of violence, of faction, and of intrigue, the Editor of
these volumes has chosen to begin his account of the affairs of Great
Britain. The papers contained in the following collection will, he is
persuaded, convince the public, that he has very much to say, that is
both striking and new. To throw some light on the work, he will here
premise a few things which require to be known. The particular expla∣nation
of the different papers, the illustration of the facts which they
contain, the various characters of the principal persons who are actors
in this comprehensive political scene, are set forth as the circum∣stances
arise.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Thomas Carte, who gave to the public a history of
England to the end of the year 1654, had been extremely industrious in
collecting materials for bringing down his work to a much later period.
Having obtained an order from Rome for inspecting such papers, belong∣ing
to the family of Stuart, as LAY OPEN in the Scotch college at Paris,
he spent several months in that place, making extracts and collecting
notes. In particular, he made very large and accurate extracts from the
Life of James the Second, written in that prince's own hand. But his
most valuable acquisition was the papers of Mr. Nairne, who had served
as under-secretary to three successive ministers of King James, during
his exile in France, from the Revolution to the year 1701. Upon the
death of that prince, Nairne continued in the service of his son; and his
collection contains an almost uninterrupted series of the correspondences
and secret negociations of the family of Stuart, down to the year 1719.</P>
<P>It is needless to explain minutely, why papers of such value lay so
long neglected and almost unknown. They are jumbled together in such
a mass of confusion, that a great deal of time and industry, and, it
may even be said, a very considerable knowledge of the period to
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
which they relate, were absolutely necessary, to give them the import∣ance
they deserve. They were placed in the Editor's hands, as mate∣rials
for a history of this country, from the Revolution till the complete
settlement of the family of Hannover on the throne. But when he ex∣amined
them with precision, he found that the extracts from the Life of
James the Second threw a new and striking light, on almost all the trans∣actions
of his brother's reign. This circumstance induced him to begin his
history with the restoration of monarchy; and to satisfy himself, as well as
to authenticate his materials to the public, he went to Paris to make still
further discoveries, and, in particular, to make fresh extracts from King
James's Memoirs.</P>
<P>During his stay in France, he not only had an opportunity to be sa∣tisfied,
concerning the faithfulness of Carte's extracts, but even to make
many valuable additions of his own. The Memoirs left by King James,
in his own hand, consist rather of memorandums made for his own use,
when the transactions happened, than a regular narration of events. He
frequently lays down, with precision, the reasons which weighed with
himself, in directing his conduct; and, upon the whole, his papers form
very important materials for the history of Britain, during his own times.
In Carte's extracts, as well as in those of the Editor, the language of
King James is, in a great measure, preserved. That prince was not
an elegant writer; and an abridgment must, in its nature, be still
more stiff and dry than an original. Instead, therefore, of expecting
entertaining reflections, and a well-connected detail of transactions, the
reader must content himself with an unadorned narrative of such facts as
were the secret, and hitherto unknown, springs of the great events of
the times.</P>
<P>But if the Memoirs of King James cannot raise their author to the
rank of a fine writer, they certainly do him credit as a man. There is
an air of veracity in all the accounts given by that prince, that is much
more valuable to an intelligent reader, than the choicest flowers of rhe∣toric
and best turned periods. Indeed, the manner in which the papers,
called his Memoirs, were written, precludes every suspicion of unfaith∣fulness
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
on his side. His notes were generally made upon the spot; and
always before there was any necessity to palliate the circumstances of the
transactions related. Besides, he was not of a complexion to misrepre∣sent.
He affected to guide himself by principle in all his actions; and
to deem the slightest deviation from truth a crime. In his opinions he is
frequently wrong, but very seldom in any fact that fell within his own
immediate knowledge.</P>
<P>How Nairne's collection came into the possession of Carte is as unim∣portant
in itself, as it is imperfectly known. Several papers, particularly
the letters of lord Caryll, which compleat the chain of the secret corre∣spondence
with Britain, are in the Scotch college, and have passed through
the Editor's hands. These, together with others which he received
through various channels, shall be pointed out, as they occur, in the
following volumes.</P>
<P>Though the correspondences of the house of STUART are highly im∣portant,
the Editor is very far from deriving his whole information from
that side. He has received original papers from several persons abroad.
At home he owes obligations of the same kind to a few. Though Mr.
ASTLE, in his PUBLIC capacity, adhered rigidly to the orders of his
office; as a private gentleman, he exhibited all the liberality of the man
of letters. He laid open to the Editor his very valuable collection of
original papers, and submitted to his perusal many scarce tracts and printed
works, concerning the history of this kingdom, from the Revolution to
the death of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>But it is to Mr. DUANE, the Editor owes the greatest and most essential
obligations. That gentleman, in his literary researches, had the good
fortune to discover, by accident, and to purchase the papers of the house
of Brunswick Lunenburgh, containing their whole correspondence with
Great Britain, from the passing of the act of settlement till George I.
was firmly established on the throne. This very valuable collection,
consisting of ten large volumes, in quarto, the proprietor, with peculiar
condescension and liberality, placed in the hands of the Editor. To
Mr. DUANE, therefore, the public are indebted, for the new, inte∣resting,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
and even complete light, which these papers throw on the whole
reign of Queen Anne; especially on the four last years of that princess,
a period hitherto very imperfectly known.</P>
<P>The valuable part of the correspondence of such persons as have made
any figure in this kingdom, must have fallen into the papers of the two
families, who were rivals for the succession to the crown. The Editor
became therefore, in some measure, indifferent about being admitted
to the inspection of private collections. He made few applications of
that kind; and in no one of these, he had the good fortune to succeed.
Men having become distrustful of the principles of their ancestors, are,
from selfish views, interested in their reputation. With a preposterous shew
of attachment to their progenitors, they seem to think, that to conceal
their actions is the only way to preserve their same. The precaution, in
the present case, was, however, supersluous. The Editor has been
enabled to give to the public, in this collection, as many particulars,
concerning men in office, as the public would wish to know. Anecdotes
of a private nature may be left, without any regret, in the possession of
their posterity, to whom alone they can be of any importance.</P>
<P>The editor must freely acknowledge, that in applying for access to
some PUBLIC collections of papers, he was as unsuccessful as in his pri∣vate
applications. He may, however, without vanity affirm, that he
was little disappointed by this refusal. The great line of business, the
official dispatches of secretaries, the negociations of plenipotentiaries,
and the instructions to ministers abroad, having, for the most part, fallen,
under the examination of the two houses of parliament, are, either upon
record in their journals, or published by their order. Where these publi∣cations
are defective, every necessary information is supplied, by the nu∣merous
and authentic memoirs, that have been printed, from time to
time, in France. Besides, the liberality of the French nation, with
regard to the free access to their state-papers, a favour seldom if ever re∣fused
to men of letters, makes ample amends for the more uncommuni∣cative
disposition prevailing in this kingdom.</P>
<P>This seeming censure, however, must, in justice, be confined in its
object. The Editor, expecting little that was new, especially to HIM,
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
on the period he has chosen, made few applications to the keepers of
public libraries. In the university of Oxford, he found some papers
which he has printed in this collection. He was assisted in his researches
by the reverend Mr. Price, keeper of the Bodleian library, in a
manner, that demand his warmest acknowledgments. He owes fa∣vours
of the same kind, to other gentlemen, in other places. He
also received papers, from persons, whose names he is not permitted to
mention to the public. He has, upon the whole, been enabled to fill
up, with interesting letters and memorials, such chasms in the corre∣spondences
of the houses of Stuart and Brunswick, as interrupted
the regular series of their respective intrigues and secret negotiations
in Britain.</P>
<P>To render still more complete his materials, the Editor, when in
France, applied for access to the valuable collection of papers, kept at
Versailles, in the office of the minister for foreign affairs. The duke
d'Aiguillon, who then presided in that department, granted his request with
peculiar politeness. But, before he could make any use of this indul∣gence,
the death of the King suspended the business of the public offices;
and he was obliged to return to Britain before the new arrangements were
made. Though the duke resigned his office, the orders he had
given were not recalled by his successors. Several clerks, in the depart∣ment
for foreign affairs, were employed, for a considerable time, in
searching for papers and in answering such queries as the Editor thought
proper to suggest, for the further illustration of the events compre∣hended
within his period.</P>
<P>Having given this short account of the sources from which he has
derived his information, the Editor thinks it necessary to say something
concerning the arrangement of his materials. The order of time has
been throughout followed with exactness. The papers themselves
have been illustrated by historical connexions, accounts of their va∣rious
authors, and uninterrupted allusions to the leading facts to
which they relate. The extracts from the Memoirs of King James
the Second are given, in one continued series, to the end of the
year 1698. The original papers, arranged with the utmost attention
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
under the heads of their respective years, begin in the memorable 1688.
At the beginning of every year, especially in the reign of Queen Anne,
an explanatory introduction is placed; and the events to which the pa∣pers
refer are briefly stated. Nothing, upon the whole, has been
omitted, that might contribute to make the collection answerable to its
title; as it actually comprehends, in the literal sense of the words, the
secret history of Great Britain, during the period to which it relates.</P>
<P>The Editor has paid throughout, the utmost attention to the satisfac∣tion
and convenience of the public. Nothing is printed, except for
mere illustration, that ever passed before through the press; at least con∣sistent
with the Editor's knowledge; and his reading, on the period of
his history, has been pretty extensive. Long memorials are abridged.
Where letters are tedious, extracts are only given. But nothing is
omitted that could be thought to contribute to throw any new light,
either on the events of history, or on the characters of men. To lessen
the expence to purchasers, the work is not swelled with originals in
languages not generally known. Three fourths of the papers themselves
are in French, Italian, and High Dutch. These were translated, under
the eye of the Editor, with the utmost care and fidelity. As the
diction of the writers themselves is seldom elegant, more care has
been taken to preserve the sense, than to embellish the sentiment.
The object of such publications as the present, is more to in∣form
than to amuse the reader; yet the Editor has been at some
pains to render it agreeable as well as instructive.</P>
<P>In the course of the following papers, place has been given
to some anecdotes and traditions preserved by the industrious Mr.
Thomas Carte. Where they are corroborated with collateral proofs,
some use has been made of them in the History. Where they
stand unsupported by other evidence, they are left to that degree of
credit, which the reader may choose to bestow. Such accounts, in their
nature uncertain and liable to deception, lose their whole force, when
opposed by the written testimony of those whom they concern. But
when they fall, with ease and fitness, into the line of established facts,
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
they deserve some portion of historical faith. The uniform fairness, with
which Carte has made his extracts from written monuments, is the best
proof of his veracity in his traditionary anecdotes. Besides, he had
frequent opportunities of being well informed. His avowed attachment
to the excluded family, introduced him to the intimacy and friendship
of several persons of rank, who entertained similar principles; and had
been partly in the secret of affairs, during the four last years of Queen
Anne.</P>
<P>The anecdotes preserved by Carte, in some instances, contradict facts
thoroughly established by Nairne's papers. This circumstance fur∣nishes
an argument, that Carte was not apprized of the treasure
which had fallen into his hands. The labour necessary in arranging
such confused materials, without which they could not be sufficiently
known, he postponed, till he should come down to the period to
which they relate. The deficiency of information in the anecdotes,
may also be accounted for on other grounds. Those who live, in any
period of time, as their knowledge is necessarily confined to one line of
men, have but a very imperfect idea of the whole system of national af∣fairs
and the intrigues and secrets of factions. A writer must stand, as
it were, in the very point, where informations from all parties unite
and concentrate, to judge of transactions and of men with precision.
He must follow no evidence implicitly, but decide on the general re∣sult
of the whole proof. This idea of his judicial capacity has a favour∣able
effect on a historian of any ability. Parties having, in a manner,
submitted their differences to his decision, his pride prevents him from
being swayed by their prejudices.</P>
<P>In a period replete with important events, and subject to revolution
and change, the Editor labouring, as it were, under the weight of
facts and materials, may have committed some mistakes, that may re∣quire
the reader's indulgence. He believes, however, that these are
not, in themselves, material; as he flatters himself, that he moved,
through his subject, with a degree of light sufficient to preclude all glaring
errors. In the translation of many papers, in making extracts from such
as were either too unimportant or tedious to be given complete, he
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
has frequently availed himself of the assistance of a friend. But as the
Editor himself has travelled, with attention, over the same ground, he
is, as he ought to be, accountable for the defects of the whole.</P>
<P>Such as it is, the Editor delivers the work, with little anxiety, to the
public. The novelty of the facts, the uninterrupted stream of fresh
light, if the expression may be used, which they throw on the history of
this country, during the period through which they extend, will, he is con∣vinced,
recommend the publication to the world. The new turn given
to many important events, and the change made in various great
characters, will, perhaps, offend such as are bigots, with regard to the
supposed political opinions and views of their forefathers. To these the
Editor has only to say, that he has religiously adhered, throughout, to
TRUTH; and that it could not be expected he should risk his OWN
reputation, by concealing any facts that came to his knowledge, though
they might tend to fully the same of THEIR ancestors.</P>

<HEAD>ORIGINAL PAPERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1660.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of Oliver Cromwell, notwithstanding the vigour
of his councils, being unsupported by the opinions of the people,
promised neither stability nor permanency. The fabric raised, by his
address and abilities, was destined to fall with his own life; and the seeds
of anarchy and confusion, which his authority had checked in their
growth rather than removed, began to spring forth from the passions of
leaders and the prejudices of parties. Sects, who had carried their en∣thusiasm
in matters of religion, into their opinions of government, had
remained in that unwilling obedience, which force extorts from fear.
The death of Cromwell, removing the fears of all, gave room to their
respective hopes. The adherents of the doctrines of the church of Eng∣land
looked forward to the restoration of monarchy. The Presbyterians,
oppressed, for several years, by the Independents, were ready to grasp
at any change that might put a period to the power of their enemies. The
Republicans themselves preferred the return of the kingly authority to
the continuance of a tyranny, that, under the name of freedom, had sub∣jected
the nation to a military government. The measures of all the
three were calculated to promote the same object, though their immediate
views were as different as their principles and inclinations.</P>
<P>Such was the undetermined state of parties, in England, in the end of
the year 1659. General Monk entered that kingdom, with an army,
on the first of January 1660. He found the nation prepared for any
change that might deliver them from the present anarchy. In their fears
from the consequences of the contests between the remains of a parliament
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="23"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
they hated and an army they had reason to fear, very little pressure was
necessary to turn the current in favour of monarchy. It is, therefore,
doubtful, whether Monk permitted himself to be carried down the
stream, or directed its force to favour his own views. His prudence, or
perhaps his timidity, was well suited to the peculiar state of the times.
When he sat, involved in his natural reserve, at the helm, he suffered the
people, in appearance, to steer their own course to what they deemed a
permanent settlement of their distracted affairs.</P>
<P>A few leading facts may be necessary to introduce the reader to the fol∣lowing
extracts. On Friday, the sixteenth of March, the long parliament was
dissolved, by their own act, after having continued, through various inter∣ruptions,
for near twenty years. On the twenty-fifth of April, the new par∣liament
assembled at Westminster. On the first of May, Annesly, pre∣sident
of the council of state, presented, unopened, a letter from King
Charles the Second to general Monk, to be by him communicated to the
council of state and officers of the army. The letter was read, with
the utmost avidity, amidst the repeated shouts of the members. The
turbulent joy of parliament was soon communicated to the people. The
King was proclaimed on the eighth of May; and before the end of the
month he arrived in London.</P>
<P>In this period, begin the extracts from the life of King James the
Second, then duke of York. They contain the whole of the se∣cret
history of his brother's reign, some very important facts concerning
his own, and many secret negociations during the first nine years of King
William. The Editor has reduced the whole, for the convenience of the
reader, into the order of time. King James, as the subject suggested
itself to his mind, made notes of the transactions in which he was most
concerned, at different periods. He sometimes kept regular journals of
the facts, as they arose. His precision, with regard to place and time,
cannot be sufficiently commended. In reviewing the facts which he had
set down in his journal, he frequently added circumstances which he had
forgot to record before; and to this must be ascribed some repetitions that
occur in the following extracts.</P>
<P>Some notes concerning the life of James, extracted from his memoirs,
are thrown into the appendix to the second volume of original pa∣pers,
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>
as they concern a period, prior to his brother's restoration to
the throne. The substance of what he wrote from the year 1652 to
1658, was given by himself to the cardinal de Bouillon, in the year
1695; and they are annexed to the memoirs of the viscount de Tu∣renne.
No part of King James's memoirs, after the Restoration, was
ever in the hands of any writer; therefore the extracts, and most of the
facts they contain, are new to the world.</P>

Oliver Cromwell was more arbitrary than any King. The

so well, as to bring his passion to such an height, as, between the time

as would have supported the monarchy, and not exposed it to the dan∣gers

would not need a parliament uncertain; or from fear of the King's
bringing in the Roman Catholic religion. The duke apprehends the last.

they reached St. Paul's, they were 1500 horse. There they met Sir Richard
Brown, lord mayor, who told them Venner and all his party were either
killed or taken. That, Venner being retreated to an ale house, they
could not take it without firing, which they durst not; but one Lam∣bert,
a seaman, afterwards commander of the duke's yatcht, and slain
on board the Anne, a third rate, perswaded some to follow him, and get
up to the top of the house, and force their entry that way. All Ven∣ner's
men were killed or wounded, before they were taken; one only
asked for quarter, at which a comrade, lying wounded in the room,
endeavoured with his sword to kill him, reviling him for being so mean,
as to ask quarter. Venner had nineteen wounds; and the surgeons had
much to do to keep him alive, until he was condemned and hanged, as
the rest were also, only two serving for witnesses.</P>
<P>This made Clarendon write to the King, to stop disbanding the ge∣neral's
troop of horse guards and regiment of foot, which were to be
paid off that day; and to raise more men, for the security of the King's
Person and government. A new regiment of guards, consisting of twelve
companies, under colonel Russel; a regiment of horse of eight troops,
under the earl of Oxford; and a troop of guards, under lord Gerard,
were ordered to be raised. The duke of York's troop of guards, then,
at Dunkirk, was sent for. Commissions also for the earls of Cleveland,
Northampton, and two other earls, for regiments of horse, and to name
their own officers, who had commissions to enlist men in several com∣panies,
not to be in present pay, but ready in case of need.</P>
<P>The chancellor and Southampton were careless of the King's safety.
Hawley was a wiser statesman. They and the bishops, in the house of
lords, were great opposers of the King's design, according to the pro∣mise
at Breda, of a toleration of dissenters, so limited as not to disturb
the peace of the realm. So the King's word was broke. The earl of
Bristol, though no privy counsellor, was as much in the secret of af∣fairs
as formerly. Bristol was of a haughty temper, yet contributed
to the chancellor's ruin. The chancellor was very loyal and true to the
interest of the crown; but did not repeal acts of Charles I. detrimental
to the crown and revenue.</P>

<P>The generality of the nation was pleased at the King's restoration,
yet the restless republican spirit began to ferment. Venner, on Sunday,
January 6th, after preaching to his congregation, and fasting all the
day with them, being before provided with arms, marched out of the
meeting-house, between eleven and twelve at night, with about thirty,
crying, “Live king Jesus;” that all that were for him should join with
them; and those who would not, might keep their houses. The con∣stables
and watch durst not venture to attack them. Venner, not being
joined, went into the woods near Highgate. The King was then at
Portsmouth, with the Queen-mother and the princess Henrietta, to see
them embark for France. The duke of York, being indisposed, was at
Whitehall with the dutchess, the marriage being owned before.</P>
<P>General Monk, who lived at the Cockpit, being allarmed, came to
give the duke of York an account. Some gentlemen-horse left unpaid
off, that lord Gerard had listed for horse guards, and the general's own
troop, commanded by Sir Philip Howard, were sent after them; but
Venner kept the woods two or three days, then came with twenty-nine
men into London, through Aldgate, about seven in the morning, crying as
before: so to Leadenhall, the Exchange, and Woodstreet; where twenty
of Gerard's horse met them, and drove them into Woodstreet. There
they made head, till the train-bands grew numerous, and the duke of
York, with the general and twenty horse, and abundance of nobility and
gentry, came to St. Pauls. The lord mayor, Sir Richard Brown, in∣formed
them that they were all either killed or taken. Venner had nine∣teen
wounds, yet he was kept alive till condemned and hanged. This
prevented the general's troop of horse guards, and his regiment of foot,
from being disbanded, which had been paid off that very day; and
caused more men to be raised. Daniel O'Neil was sent with an account
to the King, who immediately ordered a new regiment of guards, con∣sisting
of twelve companies, under colonel John Russel, brother to the
earl of Bedford, and always loyal, to be raised; and a troop of horse
guards, under lord Gerard, and a regiment of horse, of eight troops,
under the earl of Oxford. The King sent for the duke of York's troop
of guards from Dunkirk, and gave commissions to the earls of Cleve∣land,
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
Northampton, and two other earls, for regiments of horse, and to
name their under officers, to levy men, not to be in present pay, but to
be in readiness in case of need. Lord Hawley told the King, he now
looked on him as one of the most considerable men in England, since
he had raised these troops; as his enemies would fear him, and his friends
love him the better. The nation saw the sectaries would not be quiet.</P>
<P>The duke of Gloucester died about the middle of September, in the
preceding year; a prince of the greatest hopes, great courage, admirable
parts and understanding. He had a particular gift of languages;
master, besides the Latin, of French, Spanish, Italian, and low Dutch;
and but twenty years of age. The princess of Orange died also, on
Christmas-eve, at the age of twenty-nine. The King's friends quar∣relled.
Bristol set up for himself, and made his court to the dutchess of
Cleveland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the famous Barbara Villiers. She was not created dutchess of Cleveland till the 3d of August, 1670. The passage seems to have been written after her creation.</NOTE>, then angry with the chancellor's forbidding his wife to visit
her. The King showed Bristol much countenance; and he got the
regiment of horse for the earl of Oxford, then a pretender to his
daughter; since married to the earl of Sunderland; and had he not
drove on too fast, he might have got more; and might, by the help
of his <HI>she-friend,</HI> have ruined the chancellor, as he designed. But the
King knew him too well, to put him at the head of his affairs. Being
vexed, he accused the chancellor in the house of lords; and flew in the
King's face, by making an indecent speech in the house; and then jus∣tified
it to the King, in lord Aubigny's presence. He flew out into
extravagant expressions, threatening his enemies, and the King should
feel it. So that he should have been thrown out at the window, had not
the King been too good. This, however, did his business with the
King.</P>

his ruin. The Queen landed on the twentieth of May; and, after
reposing a little time, she was married by lord Abigny, the Queen's al∣moner;
privately. The outward ceremony was performed by Dr. Shel∣don.
The Portuguese, more scrupulous than other nations, would not
let her marry in Portugal by a protestant proxy. Many other propo∣sitions

the treaty of St. Jean de Luz, in the time of the great confusion in
England, either abbè Montague or lord Abigny proposed the marriage
to cardinal Mazarine, who believing Burdeaux's representations, rejected
it; but after the restoration sought it, offering a vast sum of money;

<P>The republican party were working against government. They
held private meetings, into which were admitted all sorts of dissenters,

Queen's chamber; none present but the Portugueze ambassadour, three

in the least degree can shoque one. On the contrary, she has as much agreeableness in
her looks altogether, as ever I saw; and if I have any skill in physiognomy, which I
think I have, she must be as good a woman as ever was born, Her conversation, as
much as I can perceive, is very good; for she has wit enough, and a most agreeable
voice. You would much wonder to see how well we are acquainted already. In a word,
I think myself very happy; but, I am confident, our two humours will agree very well

<P>In the beginning of 1662, Sandwich went out with a squadron to
protect the English trade in the Mediterranean, against Algiers, Tunis,
and Tripoly. He had twenty men of war with him; Sir John Lawson,
vice admiral, and Sir Robert Stainer, rear admiral. He came back with
Stainer, and left Lawson with twelve ships to prosecute the war, till
others were sent from England; such as the Royal Charles, Henry, &amp;c.

and a man of great abilities, though once his favourite. So Coventry
helped on the chancellor's ruin. Buckingham joined him. The duke
of York enquires into the condition of the fleet; which was in an ill
state. Twelve hundred thousand pounds were granted, to be employed
as the King saw fit; of which 800,000 l. was laid out in naval stores.

<P>The house of commons were ready to give the King any thing, till
after the Dutch war. They would have settled a revenue; the want
of which was the true cause of all after troubles. Factions at court
increased. They were fomented by the republican party. Little oeco∣nomy
in managing the revenue. The crown in debt. The 1200,000 l.
granted for the Dutch war, was well laid out in naval stores. The re∣publicans
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
were at work privately to raise insurrections; and in designing
against the King's person and government. But they wanted money to
provide arms and other necessaries, which the wealthy would not spare.
They could not agree about what sort of government to declare for, in
church and state; and they always broke up in a heat. As to the first,
they could never agree and come to a conclusion; their council consisting
of all sorts of dissenters, quakers, &amp;c. Their number was, at length,
reduced to six; yet they seldom met, without running into some incon∣venience.
The King was advertised of this, from time to time, by spies
and false brethren; and he secured some old officers of the army, major
Wildman and others. They were kept in prison till the year 1667,
when chancellor Hyde was laid aside. Designs of an insurrection at
London and in the north about York. In London, some of the train∣bands
were to shoot the King, when saluted at a review; and one Brad∣ford,
a serjeant of a militia regiment, at their consultations, said, if others
should miss the king, he would dispatch him with his halbert; nor did
he deny his words, when taken and brought in chains to the King.
They were proved afterwards at his trial. One Ridge, a presbyterian
preacher, denied all at first; but confessed afterwards, and served for a
witness at the trials. The man became a true penitent, and was made
mate or master at sea; and he was killed, in the year 1666, in the four

He served after in parliament. In the war, they kept intelli∣gence
with the Dutch; but the old general discovered all their designs,

was not much inclined to a war, and the chancellor averse to it. He
told the States it would be no war; when the duke of York told him
seriously, in friendship, that, without satisfaction, it would certainly be;
but he did not believe him, taking it for a design to terrify them. The
King was necessitated, by the general outcry of the nation, to declare
war in the beginning of February. This was occasioned chiefly by pri∣vate
orders sent to de Ruyter, then in the Streights with twelve men of
war, to victual at Cadiz and sail to the coast of Africa; to take Cor∣mantine
castle, in time of peace, and all the English factories on that
coast. Sir John Lawson, suspecting their design, gave notice of it to
the duke of York, by letters. On further news of de Ruyter's failing
southward, and seizing Cape de Verd, prince Rupert was ordered, with
twelve men of war and six company's ships of, at least, forty guns
each; and the fleet sailed about the middle of October. But the Dutch
having fitted a greater fleet, under Opdam, a stronger was resolved to
<PB N="26" REF="36"/>
be fitted out, under the duke of York's command; who set out in No∣vember

<P>The Dutch endeavoured to supplant the English trade every where.

got a patent, a joint stock, and set up the African company, when near
ruined. Sir Robert Holmes took some English forts on the Gambia,
which had got into the Dutch hands, and settled the company's affairs.
The Dutch sent a squadron against him, and fell on the English on the
coast of Guinea. De Ruyter victualled at Cadiz for his expedition;
when Sir John Lawson coming thither, with twelve men of war, also
judged, by it, of his design; and would fain have fought him, but
durst not without orders, so came for England. De Ruyter took twelve
of the company's ships at anchor at Cape de Verd, with the fort. The
frigate got away. He destroyed all the factories on the coast of Guinea.
A squadron was ordered against de Ruyter of twelve ships, under prince
Rupert, of third, fourth, and fifth rates, with six company's ships of
fourty guns each; but Opdam being to second de Ruyter, prince Rupert
waited at Spithead till a further recruit. Some second, third, and fourth
rates were ordered to join him in November.</P>
<P>The fleet had been much increased in the usurpation; yet, by changes
and revolutions, after Oliver Cromwell's death, was but in an ill con∣dition
at the restoration. Naval stores were much exhausted; magazines
entirely empty. The parliament gave 1200,000 <HI>l.</HI> The King, under∣standing
the true interest of the nation, and having a particular incli∣nation
to maritime affairs, ordered 800,000 of it for the fleet. The
most part was laid out n naval stores, and in filling the magazines, to
be ready to fit out the fleet. He encouraged the East India, Turkey,
Hamburgh, Canary, and other companies of trade. He set up one for
Guinea, necessary for the support of the plantations, and for hindering
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
the Dutch from being absolute masters of the whole trade; and, by the
industry of Sir Richard Ford and other merchants, got the secret from
the Dutch of dying says of such a colour as the blacks liked, and giving
them the same smell, in packing up, as the Dutch used to do at Leyden,
from whence all the says sent to Guinea were brought before.</P>
<P>The Dutch, during the civil wars in England, had encroached every
where on the English trade; and had dispossessed the English of Cor∣mantine
castle, on the gold coast. The duke of York, at the setting
up of the African company, had borrowed two ships of the King, and
sent them, under Sir Robert Holmes, with some of the company's ships
and a few land men. They seized the fort at Cape de Verd, retook the
castle of Cormantine, and left garrisons in both. They settled factories
of the company's all along the coast. Some time after, the king gave
to the duke a patent for Long Island, in the West Indies, and a tract
of Land between New England and Maryland, which always belonged
to the crown of England, since first discovered; and upon which the
Dutch had encroached, during the rebellion, and built a town and some
forts to secure the beaver trade to themselves. The duke of York, bor∣rowing
of the King two ships of war, sent Sir Richard Nicholas, groom
of the bed-chamber, and an old officer, with three hundred men, to
take possession of the country; which the Dutch gave up, on compo∣sition,
without being blockaded. Most of the Dutch inhabitants re∣mained
there. The rest were of Old England inhabitants, and some of
other nations, who had planted there, at first, with the English. Colonel
Nicholas remained there, in peaceable possession of the country; and then
called it New York and the Fort of River Albany.</P>
<P>All this happened before the breaking out of the first Dutch war;
and, as the duke of York did all on his side to advance trade, the par∣liament,
pressed by the King, did all on theirs to make it flourish, by
the Act of Navigation, &amp;c. for encouraging trade and building ships.
All the people's heads, hearts, and purses turned that way. They be∣gan,
therefore, to enquire into the injuries and depredations of the
Dutch, during the late civil wars, in all trading parts of the world;
and, at last, the house of commons entered into it; and the nation in
general concluded, that satisfaction should be had of the Dutch. But
this was impracticable without a war. The Dutch would give no satisfaction
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
or redress to the merchants, for the injuries done them; believing
that the nation would not enter into the merchants quarrel, at the ex∣pence
of a sea war; especially as the chancellor Hyde was averse to a
war, and the King not inclined to it. But by the impetuosity of the
members of the house of commons, as well as the traders and seamen,
who used to get the better of the Dutch in Oliver Cromwell's time, the
chancellor could not withstand the bent of the whole nation, which drew
it on sooner than otherwise it would have been.</P>
<P>The duke of York told Van Gough, the Dutch ambassador, that it
would be carried against the King and the chancellor's inclinations, un∣less
satisfaction was given: but in vain. De Wit, having had a private
power from the States, with the advice of three or four more of their
body, to do what he judged best for the public good, on advice of what
Sir Robert Holmes had done, sent private orders to de Ruyter, then in
the Streights with twelve men of war, to take in a sufficient supply of
victuals at Cadiz, and fail for Africa; to take the castle of Cormantine,
and to ruin all the factories on the gold coast. Lawson found, by the
sort of victuals, de Ruyter's design; but, in a council of war, it was
resolved not to attack him without orders.</P>
<P>The duke of York, in November 1664, put to sea, with forty men
of war, to stop Opdam between Portland and la Hogue. After four
or five days, he returned to Portsmouth; Opdam having orders not to
stir. A small squadron was left to cruize off the Isle of Wight.</P>

general rendevous of the fleet, and hasted their equipment; yet was not
ready in five weeks. He ordered all the flag-officers on board with him
every morning, to agree on the order of battle and rank. In former
battles no order was kept; and this, under the duke of York, was the
first, in which fighting in a line and regular form of battle had been
observed.</P>

duke resolved to visit them on their own coast. He anchored near the
mouth of the Texel, and viewed all their fleet in the harbour. They
set up beacons, fearing a landing. The duke, after taking ten Dutch
merchant-men, returned to Gunfleet, to repair and take in fresh water;
and went out again, on the thirtieth of May, making all the use he
could of the tide, because the east wind would bring the Dutch upon
the English coast; and the duke could not, till June 1st, get to Southwold
bay, where he anchored; and about one <HI>p. m.</HI> the Dutch fleet appeared
to windward, consisting of an hundred and thirteen men of war, eleven
fire ships, and seven yauchts, under Opdam. Some of the greatest of
the English ships had gone, that morning, to make up their compli∣ment,
out of a great fleet of colliers passing by, and bound for London.
The wind, which was still easterly, fell, towards evening, so low, that
no great way could be made; yet both fleets endeavoured to get what
wind there was.</P>
<P>On the second of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> the Dutch were not seen till ten in the morn∣ing.
The duke, with a fresh gale, stood towards them, with thirty of
his best sailers, but thought fit to keep about two leagues distance, till
all the fleet joined; then, in order, he advanced forwards; so that, be∣fore
close of evening, both were within two leagues of one another.
The duke was then about eight leagues east of Leostoff, and the weather
calm all the night.</P>
<P>About two next morning, the Dutch were discovered lighting their
matches and preparing for fight. They observed the same order of
battle as the English, all in a line. At day-break, a fresh gale arose at
south-west; and the duke got the wind. The white squadron had the
van, and Sir C. Myres, who fired the first shot, led it; whilst the Dutch
were led on by three flag ships, Tromp, Courtenaer, and Stellingwers.</P>

so long about it, that before he could let the flag fly, Opdam had,

tacks on board; which the enemy's van seeing, sprung their luff, hoping

to weather most of the white squadron. The duke observing this, stopped
the intended signal, left it might put the whole fleet in disorder; and, in∣stead
of bearing up round, as most of the white had done, he tacked only
when it came to his turn. This little accident lost above six hours; and then
the duke gave the signal; whereby the whole fleet tacked at once. Both
fleets had now their starboard tacks on board, and lay as close hauled as
they could. But the Dutch found great benefit by this accident: for
had the signal been given as soon as it was intended, both the English
and they would have had their larboard tacks on board, and would have
stood towards the coast of England; so that, when the Dutch gave
way, they would have been more exposed, by having a greater run to
make toward their own coast.</P>
<P>In the two first passes, little damage was done. The Dutch only took
the Charity, of fifty guns; a slow failer, which had been taken from
them in the first Dutch war. Both fleets endeavoured to get the wind.
The duke of York, in the Royal Charles, a very good sailer, got a-head
of the earl of Sandwich, who was in the Prince, a heavy sailer, though
the stoutest ship in the fleet. Had not the duke done so, the Dutch
would have stretched out a-head, and might have weathered him. The
duke, with the red squadron, had now the van, the blue the battle, and
the white the rear.</P>
<P>The heat of the engagement began at ten in the morning; a fresh
gale at south-west, and not a cloud in the sky. The duke bore down
on Opdam. About two <HI>p. m.</HI> the Dutch fire began to diminish. Op∣dam
was blown up at the third shot of the duke's gunner. All the
Dutch fleet ran, except the Orange, commanded by Sebastian Seaton,
a Scot, who attempted to board the duke of York; but was hin∣dered,
by Sir Jeremy Smith, who, by a broadside, killed sixty of his
men; and the Royal Catherine pouring in another, the Orange struck.
The Marsoman of eighty guns and two other Dutch ships were burnt,
by a fire-ship, after they had struck. The duke ordered the captain of
the fire-ship to be tried; but he fled before the time appointed for his
trial. The Dutch were chased to the mouth of the Texel, but they got
in, the English having no fire-ship to fasten on them. The duke stood
out to sea again; and returned to the buoy at the Nore. He sent scouts
to watch the Dutch, who took two of their ships of forty guns. The
command of the fleet, by the King's orders, was left to the earl of Sand∣wich;
<PB N="31" REF="41"/>

<HEAD>EXTRACT II.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of York went from London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> on the twenty-third of March,
to Gunfleet, the general rendevous, to take the command of the fleet;
but could not sail till the beginning of May. Yet he did not lose his
time. He called the officers on board of him every morning, and settled
the orders of battle and watch. For though they fought well in Oliver
Cromwell's time, they observed not due order; and bravery alone car∣ried
it. The war, this year, was the first in which the fleet was drawn
up in a line and in order.</P>
<P>The fleet consisted of ninety-eight ships of the line: three first rates,
eleven second, fifteen third, thirty-two fourth, eleven fifth, and twenty-six
merchant-ships, armed with fourty or fifty guns; four fire-ships, three sixth
rate frigates, and three yachts, besides ketches. The duke of York com∣manded
the red, admiral Lawson vice admiral, and Sir William Berkeley
rear admiral. Prince Rupert, vice admiral of the fleet, commanded
the white squadron, Sir Christopher Mimmes and captain Sampson his
vice and rear admirals. The earl of Sandwich, rear admiral of the fleet,
commanded the blue, and Sir George Ayscue and captain Tiddeman his
vice and rear admirals.</P>
<P>In May the duke sailed toward Holland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> and then from Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veling to the
Texel, where he saw the Dutch fleet at anchor. He steered ten leagues
off, to let the fleet come out. About nine in the morning, the fog
clearing up, he saw ten Dutch merchant ships, escorted by two men of
war; which last escaped, but the merchant ships were all taken. A
storm destroying the masts of some of the ships, he returned to Gunfleet
to resit and take in water.</P>
<P>About the end of May he sailed again; and, expecting the Dutch
fleet at sea, as it proved, got, on the first of June, with great difficulty,
to Southwold bay. Two scout ships, which were sent towards Hol∣land,
under captain Golding of the Diamond, and captain Ayliffe of the
Yarmouth, took two Zealand direction-ships. Five hundred coalliers
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>
passed by him without an escort; and, about an hour after, the Dutch
fleet, one hundred and thirteen ships of the line, and thirteen fire-ships,
appeared, under Opdam, a brave man, but no seaman. Tromp, under
him, commanded the Amsterdam squadron. J. Evertson admiral of
Zealand, and Stellingwers of Friezland.</P>
<P>The next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> June the second, at day-break, the Dutch fleet were
not seen; nor were they seen till ten. Two leagues off, some English
ships were pressing sailors out of the coalliers, to make up their equipage.
The duke of York failed towards them; and, before night, eight
leagues east of Leostoff, came within a small league of the Dutch.</P>
<P>The next day, June the third, the Dutch fleet were found in a line, like
the English. A little wind, S. W. rose at day-break; the fight began at
three; being the first day that could be found for an engagement. The sea
was smooth, and not a cloud in the sky. Sir. J. Lawson was wounded in
the knee, by a great shot; his ship disabled, and forced to lay by to resit;
and all his division, not yet well versed in fighting orders, did so to
look after their flag. The duke of York, with only four or five ships
a-head of him, bore the hottest of the fight. The earl of Falmouth,
lord Muskerry, and Mr. Boyle were all slain with one shot, as they stood
on the quarter-deck, by the duke of York. The earl of Marlborough
and his nephew, the earl of Portland, were also slain. Muskerry was a
gentleman of the bed-chamber to the duke of York, a brave man, and
a good foot officer. Falmouth, a good horse officer, and captain of
the duke of York's guards. Boyle, who had never been in any service
before, was the earl of Burlington's son.</P>
<P>By the fire of the duke of York's lowest tier of guns, at the third
shot, gun after gun, Opdam blew up, and the Dutch fleet all fled. About
half an hour after two, four of their ships fell foul of one another,
and, the duke ordering a fire-ship to clap them a-board, they were all
fired in a moment; and the men, jumping into the sea, were taken up.
The fourth squadron of the Dutch appearing to westward, the Duke of
York lay by, whilst the body of the fleet followed the chase. The duke
of York getting again on head of the Dutch, three more of their ships
fell foul of one another, about six <HI>p. m.</HI> and were burnt by a fire-ship.
Very few were saved. The Dutch were pursued till night; and had it
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>
not been for an accident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet ascribes it preposterously to design. He has strangely misrepresented this fact; and indeed almost all the facts, concerning this unfortunate prince.</NOTE>, most of them would have been taken next
morning before they got into the Texel.</P>
<P>When it began to grow dark, the duke ordered the Norwich, a fifth
rate, captain Witwang, to keep just a-head of him all night, to carry
lights out, and keep up close with the Dutch; that, if they should clear
their course, to fire guns and make false fires, to put up more lights,
and to steer the same course with them; so as not to lose them in the
night, in order to engage them at day-break. After giving these orders,
he staid on deck till quite dark; then went down to his cabin for a little
rest. But before he laid down, he went again on the quarter-deck, to
see how all went; and, going down about eleven, he repeated his or∣ders,
to be sure to keep close up with the Dutch, to fight them when
the day broke. He had no sooner laid himself down on a quilt, with
his cloaths on, than H. Brounker went up to the quarter-deck, and tried
to persuade captain Cox, master of the Royal Charles, to shorten sail,
not to expose the duke of York, by running amongst his enemies in the
night; his ship being so good a sailer, that not only he might find him∣self,
at day-break, too far engaged among them, but be also exposed to
have some of their fire-ships clapt on board him, and thwart his hause,
in the night: that he should take care of the duke's person, being heir
to the crown. Cox answered, he was but master of the ship; that the
duke of York had ordered to make what sail he could; and, without a
command from him, or an order from some superior officer, he neither
could nor would do it.</P>
<P>Brounker then addressed himself to captain Harman, first lieutenant,
a brave and experienced commander, and a man of good sense, using
the same and other arguments; but in vain, unless ordered by Sir W.
Pen, the captain. Brounker went under deck, and coming up again,
told Harman that the duke ordered him to shorten fail, though he never
so much as went into the duke's cabin. Harman not thinking it possible
for a gentleman to tell a lye, not only shortened fail, but, after some
time, brought to; as was afterwards proved, on examination of the
affair before the house of commons. But fearing it might produce some
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>
disorder in the fleet, as it did, he put in a short time before the wind
again, and settled his topsails a little; and just as day began to break,
hoisted them a trip again, a moment before the duke, who knew nothing
of what had passed, came on the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>Thus the Dutch got a good deal a-head of us; and when it grew
light, the duke of York found himself half a league a-stern of the
Dutch, and the like distance a-head of the body of his own fleet, with
only the Centurion, a fourth rate, captain Moulton, and two of his
yachts near him. He fancied his ship being a good sailer made him so
far a-head of his own fleet; and that the Dutch had outsailed him, by
our going right before the wind, and their drawing less water than us.
The Dutch kept all their sail to the Texel, followed by third and fourth
rates, who took some. But the tyde not serving to enter the Texel,
they came to an anchor so near the sands, and in such shallow water,
that we durst not venture near them with our great ships; and they were
of too much force, and too numerous, for our small ones. Four or
five fire-ships would have destroyed the most of them, before the tyde
turned them in. But we had only four fire-ships when the fight began;
three of which were spent, and one disabled. The third had been spent
on the Helverton of sixty-six guns, which cleared itself of her, but was
taken. The Dutch lost twenty or twenty-two men of war; all above
fourty guns but one. Eight only were burnt; and about eight thousand
prisoners taken. Four admirals were slain, Opdam, Courtenaer, Stel∣lingwerts,
and Seram; one vice admiral and one rear admiral. Ten
thousand men were either slain, drowned, burnt, taken or wounded.
Not above eight hundred English slain and wounded, besides what were
lost in the Charity. Sir J. Lawson died of the wound in his knee. The
duke of York returning to the Buoy at the Nore, the earl of Sandwich
was left in the command of the fleet; and he went to intercept de
Ruyter and the Dutch East India fleet and ships, coming round from the
Streights, by the back of Ireland and Scotland. The duke would have
gone to sea again, but the King would not permit him.</P>
<P>The plague broke out in London. The King went to Salisbury. He
sent, at the same time, the duke of York to York, to take care of the
northern counties; and left the duke of Albemarle and the earl of
Craven, with half of the foot guards and a troop of horse, to take care
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>
of London, left the republicans and fanatics, encouraged by the Dutch,
should rise. The duke of York knew nothing of Brounker's affair,
till the parliament met at Oxford, in October; when he was very angry,
that it had been concealed from him. The house of commons examin∣ing
it, the duke was hindered from trying Brounker by a court martial.
He withdrew into France; and the house of commons only expelled him.</P>
<P>The faction at court, against the chancellor, began to increase. The
duchess of Cleveland, then promoting Buckingham and Arlington, railed
against him. Sir William Coventry and all laboured to set the house of
commons against the chancellor. They advised the King to break the
Canary company, who took off every year two hundred thousand
pounds of our woollen manufactures; and had the wines very cheap,
being masters of the trade. When the company was broke, the Ca∣narians
made them pay twice as much for wines, and would take no∣thing
but ready money. The reason was plain: the first ship which ar∣rived
there, not caring what she paid for loading, being sure of selling
it as she pleased, at her return to England; the Canarians made the rest
pay the same rate, which could not happen to a company. Bristol's
attacks on the chancellor, in the house of Lords, miscarried. The
King supporting the chancellor, Bristol harrangued the commons, with∣out
leave from the lords.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT II.</HEAD>
<P>The house of commons were weary of the war, which they had forced
the King into. The ministers desired peace, the parliament not sup∣plying
the King to carry on the war with vigour. This caused the differ∣ence;
since the money would not suffice to fit out the whole fleet. The
duke of York opposed this scheme, thinking it would have a contrary
effect: for though the last year's success was not great, we losing ten,
and the Dutch but four, men of war; yet the Dutch seamen were so
discouraged, by the valour of the English, when overpowered and un∣able
to resist them, on equal numbers, that it would be very hard for
them to man their fleet; and then they would be forced to take the
same resolution proposed by the lords, and might probably propose a
peace. But if our great ships were laid up, their fleet would not want
men; and though the money was short, yet, with good husbandry and
other means, the whole fleet might be fitted out: though the project
might save the King money, yet it would be burdensome to the nation;
for the Dutch being masters at sea, all the militia upon the coast must
necessarily be raised and kept in arms during the Summer. He urged
also, the danger the great ships would run at Chatham. He, however,
did not prevail; the chancellor joining with the others against it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="48"/>
This so encouraged the Dutch seamen, that their fleet was soon and
fully manned. They came up to the Buoy at the Nore. They de∣stroyed
seven ships at Chatham, and carried away the Charles, a first
rate; and, had they pressed vigorously on, they might have done more
mischief. Had the directions given by the duke of York, for securing
the ships at Chatham, been executed, and the fire-ships and boats used,
as projected, the Dutch had not found so easy a work as they did. The
disaffected, in parliament, made use of this disaster. Private meetings of
the great ones were held, with the presbyterians, who were ever ready to
disturb monarchy.</P>
<P>The earl of Northumberland and Leicester, lord Hollis, and another,
met at Guilford. They made it no secret. Northumberland, at St.
James's, talked freely to the duke of York, against the chancellor,
who was hated, and of the resolution to impeach him; but said, that
was not all, the nation would not be satified, unless the guards were
disbanded, and other grievances redressed. He talked very seditiously,
though the duke checked him. The earl told him, that he had said
nothing, but what he would repeat to the King the next day; as he did,
with insolence enough. The duke urged, in vain, the necessity of the
guards, for the King's safety, and national quiet; that the want of them
had been fatal to the late King and his government. The seditious
stuck to their point, and joined with the chancellor's enemies; hoping
that his impeachment would breed a quarrel, between the King and the
duke of York.</P>
<P>The King took the seals from the chancellor. He told the duke of
York of the resolution; that it was not out of any dissatisfaction with
the chancellor, but the necessity of his affairs; and that it was better to
do it of himself than let it be torn from him by the parliament. He
ordered the duke to tell him, that he must send the seals; and, to shew
his regard for him, he would confirm the little private pension he usually
received. The chancellor sent the seals; and told the duke of York,
that his enemies would not stop there, but proceed to the last degree
to expose the King and crown, to accomplish his ruin. So it proved.</P>
<P>The parliament met, on the tenth of October. Sir T. Littleton
moved thanks to the King, for his speech and for taking the great seal
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>
from Clarendon; and to consider the heads of the King's and the lord
keeper's speeches. The clause about Clarendon would hardly have
passed, had not the King ordered his servants to let it be known he de∣sired
it; and Clarendon charged his friends not to oppose it, being re∣solved
to let none of his private concerns disturb the King's affairs.
The same means were used, in the house of lords, when they were moved
to join in the address, else it had not passed there. When it came to a
vote, the duke of York and several others withdrew, not to oppose the
King, as they looked on it, as an ill precedent for the crown.</P>
<P>On the twenty-sixth of October, the chancellor was accused, on pub∣lic
same; and a committee was appointed to consider of proceedings
and precedents. That very day, the duke of York, in discourse with
the King, about the talk of Clarendon's advising him to govern by an
army and lay aside parliaments; the King assured him, that he had
never given him such advice. His enemies considered not public good,
but private malice; and, getting to the head of affairs, give the King
and crown a fatal blow. The King soon found the effects. The duke
of York was seized with the small-pox, in the beginning of November;
and before his recovery the heat of the prosecution was over, else he
would have been charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> with influencing the lords not to imprison
Clarendon. Buckingham and lord Berkeley were so malicious, as, in
their common discourse, to insinuate, that the King was in danger, by
letting his brother have his own guards to wait on himself at Whitehall;
none knowing what the duke might be prevailed on to do, by the chan∣cellor
and his duchess. Some presbyterians sent to Clarendon, offering
to stand by him, if he would stand by himself. He saw their malice;
and the King, apprehending heats in the house of commons, sent to him
to withdraw out of the realm privately. Clarendon, as the duke was
recovering, sent him word of the message and his resolution to obey it.
The presbyterians were very angry, at his disappointing them.</P>
<P>Thus fell the earl of Clarendon; from whose fall one may date the
beginning of all the misfortunes, which happened since, and the decay
of the authority of the crown; he generally supporting that prerogative,
which his successors never minded. He was a private gentleman of a
good family, bred in the law, had good sense, and very eloquent; al∣ways
<PB N="40" REF="50"/>
esteemed for his good parts. He was chosen by the late King a
private manager for him in the house of commons, which he per∣formed,
with great dexterity and fidelity. He was intrusted, at court,
with the most secret affairs; for his services, made chancellor of the
Exchequer; one of the council to the prince of Wales; relied on and
went with him to France. He was sent ambassador, with Collington,
then lord treasurer, to Spain. He returned to the King, at Paris; and
was made his first minister. He had the management of the restoration,
with Monk and Sandwich. At the restoration, he was in such favour
with the King, that no body durst oppose him. He carried all before
him. He made his friend, Southampton, treasurer; and, by the aid of
the duke of Ormonde and the bishops, was caressed by most. As to the
crown, he let the court of Wards and Purveyance be parted with. But
he did not get a good substantial revenue settled on the crown, though
it might have been easily done, in the first parliament, which the King
called. This was out of fear, that the crown should grow too great and
the Roman Catholic religion be brought in, if the King was at his ease;
the duke of Ormonde and Daniel O'Neile having, in the King's journey
to Spain, observed him inclined to it.</P>
<P>The new ministry, to gain popularity, at the expence of the crown,
released several dangerous men; all avowed republicans and old officers
of Cromwel's army. Of these was major Wildman, who had opposed
all the several governments, colonel Salmon, Mr. Creed, Mr. Bremen
and others; men of good sense, who had great credit with the common
men and disbanded officers of the rebel army, and whose confinement
the duke of Albemarle advised, as absolutely necessary for the safety of
the government, they only wanting an opportunity to overturn it. They
had still plots on foot, though discovered by the duke of Albemarle,
and some executed for designed risings, as Rymer, Tong and others, in
the North; others for murdering the King, as one Bradford or Bradley
and others, in Tothilfields, at the review of a militia regiment.</P>
<P>Clarendon being removed, his enemies divided; each pretending to
succced, in the ministry. Sir William Coventry, without whose help Buck∣ingham
and Arlington could not have carried on the plot, expected it,
and was the only man fit for it. But the other two joining against him,
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>
though of the best capacity of any in the kingdom, got him out of all
his employments; and then strove who should have most credit with the
King, whose affairs suffered by their disagreement and insufficiency.</P>

<P>After the chancellor's removal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> the ministers disagreed among them∣selves.
Sir William Coventry was turned out of all his employments,
by Bucks and lord Arlington. They all joined to lessen the duke of
York's interest with the King, lest he should get Clarendon recalled.
When the duke recovered of the small-pox, he gave, in the house of
lords, his reasons, for voting against Clarendon's impeachment; because
no proof was made of any of the crimes laid to his charge. The King
was, on this account, colder to the duke. The malicious insinuations
of his enemies were fruitless. The chancellor's friends were removed.
Wildman and others were released. The duke of Ormonde was re∣moved.
Bucks and Arlington labour to supplant one another. The
duke of York's enemies, Bucks and Bristol, would divorce the King
from the Queen, also the republican party. Bristol goes, <HI>incog.</HI> to Par∣ma
to find out a new wife for the King, among the duke of Parma's
daughters. The duke of York cautioned the King against it. Lord
Roos's divorce was carried on in parliament, for a precedent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTRACT II.</HEAD>
<P>They fell on several of the chancellor's relations and friends. They
got some removed, and others suspended, from waiting. They brought
in their own creatures, many of them not fit for their employments.
The duke of Buckingham got leave to buy the duke of Albemarle's
post of master of the horse; which before, when any had a mind to
treat for it, was refused, on pretence, that it was not proper for the old
general to quit it. Secretary Morris not being a man for their turn,
Buckingham and Arlington joined to bring in Trevor, a creature of
theirs, though not proper for such a place of trust; having only been
acquainted with matters of state under Oliver Cromwell, with whom
he had been very great. This scandalized loyal men very much. But
the two new ministers minded not much what was said of them; and
<PB N="42" REF="52"/>
they got the King to pay for the change, though money was hard
enough to be got. This being done, they began to think of removing
Ormonde from the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland. 'Twas the earl of Orery
who first put Buckingham on it; which earl was famous for changing
parties so often, and for making a speech to Cromwell, to take the title
of King. His tongue was well hung. He had some good parts; and
he was reckoned so cunning a man, that nobody would trust him or
believe what he said.</P>

of Anglesey, who then was, or lately had been, vice-treasurer of Ireland,
and who had no great kindness for Ormonde, hoping, by that means,
to frighten him to join with them in it, to save himself, which he did.
Though he had been an old rebel, he was very instrumental in the re∣storation;
and was, therefore, made an earl. There might be some
reason for their accusation of mismanagement of the revenue, by not
paying the troops and the civil lists so regularly as they ought, and not
minding the government duly; yet the method of proceeding against
him was very irregular and scandalous; especially to see one, who had
always been so loyal, though he might, otherwise, have faults, arraigned
and prosecuted, by men, who had been most of them downright rebels
or worse, as Buckingham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though the following letters contain no material information, they may serve as a specimen of the respect, which his royal highness always entertained for the duke of Or∣monde.

</LETTER></NOTE> The duke of York took his part; look∣ing
<PB N="43" REF="53"/>
on all that was laid to his charge, as false and malicious, and know∣ing
the malice of his accusers and their designs of getting all loyal men
laid aside; and putting in those, who had been otherwise or could be
absolutely depended upon. They, at last, gained their point, with re∣gard
to the duke of Ormonde; and lord Roberts, who had been an old
rebel, was sent in his room.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="54"/>
This so encouraged them, that they believed they should carry all
before them; and jealous, that the duke of York might cross their de∣signs
sooner or later, and that he would not forgive them what they had
done to chancellor Hyde, did all they could to misrepresent him to the
King, and to make the King jealous of him; and not prevailing with the
King, who knew his brother too well, they did all they could to pro∣voke
the duke to do some warm thing even to them, that they might
have a subject to complain of him. They endeavoured to mortify him
several ways. Some of their friends talked of taking the Admiralty
from him, his troop of horse guards and regiment of foot; and, by un∣derhand
means, endeavoured to persuade the King to be divorced from
the Queen as barren, and get another wife. They discoursed with law∣yers
about it, and got divines to write of its lawfulness; in which con∣curred
the earl of Bristol, another enemy of the duke's on Clarendon's
account, who was so zealous in it, that he went privately into Italy, to
see if there were any princesses there fit to be proposed to the King.
Others were, even then, for proposing to the King to own the duke of
Monmouth.</P>
<P>The earls of Carlisle and Shaftesbury were the persons who gave this
advice. But the duke of York knew not, that it was these two earls
that proposed it to the King, till the King told it to him; about the time
of the Rye-house conspiracy. The duke, advertised of the designs of
his enemies, and finding that he had not credit enough with the King
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>
to take public notice of it, or to have such ill men continued no longer
in his confidence, hoped, by patience, to weather the storm, and give
his enemies no advantage. They seeing it, took all advantages of
mortifying him, almost in every thing; but especially in what concerned
the admiralty. They hoped, to weary him out of it, by obstructing
whatever he proposed, though ever so fit or reasonable; and getting
some of their own creatures into employment there, whether the duke
would or no. They, got Sir T. Osborne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Well known, under the successive titles of the lord Latimer, earl of Danby, marquis of Caermarthen, and duke of Leeds. The duke afterwards recommended this Osborne, whom he blames, to be lord-treasurer, upon the resignation of Clifford. It ought to be observed, that all these secret intrigues, mentioned by the duke, have been hitherto ut∣terly unknown to the public. They throw light on a period little understood.</NOTE> and Sir T. Littleton made
treasurers of the navy; the first was Buckingham's friend, and the last
Arlington's; without so much as speaking, or making the least applica∣tion
to the duke. Though the place and all patent offices are not in
the admiral's gift, yet, by him they are recommended, and he gives his
warrant to the attorney-general, to prepare the bill for the King's sign∣ing.
The King ordered the duke to sign it for them, without their or
their friends making the least application to him. This obstructed Sir
Jeremy Smith from being made a commissioner of the navy for some
time, though an old sea commander, and absolutely the fittest man in
England for it.</P>
<P>Though these ministers joined in mortifying the duke of York, they
did not agree well together, each pretending, to have the greatest interest
with the King; and they took all means to ruin one another. To this
end, Bucks sent a message to the duke, by the earl of Berks, one of his
great confidents, to offer his service to him, in the beginning of Decem∣ber;
and made great protestations of what he would do for him. The
duke answered, that Buckingham had several times made professions, but
never had performed or kept his word; so that he could not trust him.
Besides, it would do Buckingham no good, and himself harm; by af∣fording
Arlington an opportunity to represent to the King, that, as soon
as the duke saw the King withdraw his favour from any of the ministers,
he joined with them. He looked on it too as below him, to join or
meddle with any of their cabals; his business being, to serve the King in
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>
his own way. Lest Buckingham should make any story or misrepresen∣tation
of this, the duke gave the King an account of what had passed;
but did not name the messenger.</P>
<P>Buckingham and lord Francis Villiers were bred up, with the King
and the duke of York, at Richmond. They were both handsome, pro∣per
men; but unlike to one another, both in face and temper. When
the rebellion broke out, they were sent to travel; and, as I remember,
returned not back to England till the King was made a prisoner. Their
first appearance in action was with the earl of Holland, in a rising for the
King, in 1648, near Kingston on the Thames; where they were routed
by Sir Miles Livesey, L. Francis slain, Holland taken, and the whole
party dispersed. Buckingham escaped beyond sea and joined the prince;
who, being bred up together, had almost a natural inclination for him.
When he came to the crown, he gave him the garter, made him gentle∣man
of the bedchamber, and was glad of any occasion to shew him kind∣ness.
He took him with him, in all his journeys, from Holland to
France; from Jersey back, through France, to Holland and Scotland.
Here he first began to shew his true temper. For, notwithstanding the
King's extraordinary kindness to him, he sided with the marquis of
Argyle; who, at the King's first arrival, had all the power in his hands,
against the loyal party; and when the King had made an agreement,
with his old friends, to escape from Argyle and head them, Bucking∣ham
refused to follow him. The King intrusted him with some papers,
which he could not carry with him, and sealed them up; charging him
not to open them. But Buckingham, without any regard to the King's or∣ders,
opened them. All which the King passed over and took him along
with him to Worcester, from whence he escaped, as well as the King,
to France, where the King continued as kind to him as ever.</P>
<P>He stayed some years in France; and finding friends among the govern∣ment
of England, to go over thither, the King consented. But he had
no sooner arrived, than he made his court to Oliver Cromwell, by pro∣posing
to marry one of his daughters. He railed and talked slightingly
of the King; and professed, that he desired nothing more, than to ven∣ture
his life against Charles Stuart, as he then called him. This was to
ingratiate himself with Oliver Cromwell, though it had the contrary
effect. When a friend of Buckingham's said this to Cromwell, he re∣plied,
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>
that he would never give his daughter to one, who could be so
ungrateful to the King; (Oliver Cromwell always calling the King so
whenever he named him) he owing all he had to the family. Having
failed there, he, with much ado, got lord Fairfax's daughter. These
actions were enough to give the King an ill opinion of him, which he
shewed at his first coming into England, after the restoration. When
the King came to Canterbury, where he first formed his council, Buck∣ingham
was the only man, of those who had the honour beyond sea, that
was not called to it. But this mortification did not last long. He had
so great an ascendant over the King, and being pleasant in his conversa∣tion,
that he was brought into the privy council; and, by degrees, into
the King's trust and confidence. But being of ill principles, he abused
the King's goodness, and joined with factious people against the crown,
on several occasions. He affected popularity, which he could not ob∣tain,
by his too airy wit and lewdness; and to be first minister, for
which he wanted steddiness and application. The duke of York advised
him not to aim at what he was neither fit for nor could obtain; and to
be content with the King's favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What follows, to the end of the paragraph, seems to have been written long after the rest.</NOTE>. But he would not follow it, nor
that of his friends about his estate, 20,000 l. a-year, at the restoration,
which he squandered; and, before he died, none would trust him or
credit a word he said. King James, at his accession, was forced to give
a 1000 l. a-year to his wife, for her subsistence.</P>
<P>It was lucky for the duke of York, that, at this time, Sir W. Ar∣mourer,
a truly honest man, very stout, who had been esquire to Charles
the First, and had served as an officer all the war, and followed the King
in exile, came bluntly to him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The King.</NOTE>, and, in the presence of three or four of
his bedchamber, said he had heard strange news in the country, where
it was warmly reported, that the King intended to disband his brother's
troop of guards and regiment of foot. The reasons were, that he had
so much disobliged the King already, that it was not safe to let the duke
have such a body of men under his command; and he must secure him∣self
from him, by putting it out of his power to revenge himself: That
these and such damned discourses were all over the country. To which
<PB N="48" REF="58"/>
the King replied, it was the greatest lye in the world; that it had never
entered into his head; and, on the contrary, that he had all the kind∣ness
in the world for his brother; and were he master of more king∣doms
than he had, he would trust them all in his hands, such was his
confidence in him. Sir W. Armourer added, he heard it reported, that
he designed to have the duke of Monmouth declared legitimate. A
thought, he said, which never entered into his head; that he abhorred
it, and would endeavour to find out the authors of so villainous a report,
and have them punished. These discourses of the King, however, did
not hinder the party to carry on their designs; and to insinuate these
thoughts into Monmouth, who swallowed the poison very eagerly.</P>
<P>About this time, the duke of York discoursed with the King, if he
continued in the same mind, as to his religion; who assured him he did,
and desired nothing more than to be reconciled. About the end of De∣cember,
he consulted lord Arundel of Wardour, lord Bellasis, Arling∣ton,
and Sir Thomas Clifford, about it, who met Jan. 25, 1669; yet
Arlington and others opposed the duke of York, as to the navy.</P>
<P>Sir William Coventry gave up his place, under the duke of York,
when he joined in impeaching Clarendon, with Sir Thomas Osborne,
lieutenant-colonel Howard, Mr. Seymour, lord Vaughan, by Bucking∣ham;
Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir R. Temple, and Sir R. Car, by Ar∣lington.
Fearing the duke of York would get Clarendon recalled, the
bill of banishment was brought in, by the King's leave. Shaftesbury
made use of it, in Sir Thomas Bend's case. Buckingham, by his ill
conduct, lost all credit with the King. Arlington was a weak man and,
with his pride, very timorous; yet had cursed cunning. He was sup∣ported
by Sir Thomas Clifford, a man of good sense, bold and gene∣rous,
whom he had once obliged. He preserved himself some years;
but was laid aside, by degrees. Sir Orlando Bridgman was an honest,
but a weak man. To pave the way for the divorce, a bill was brought
into the house, to give leave for lord Roos to marry; his wife being
divorced for adultery. This was to serve as a precedent for the King.
It was much pushed by the party; and, with much ado, passed. The
King promoted it. But it was the absent proxies, and not the present
lords, who carried it. The first were forty-one, against thirty-nine; but
it was carried by the proxies. Of eighteen bishops, only two voted for
<PB N="49" REF="59"/>
it. One of those was governed by his counsel, Sir Gilbert Gerard; and
the other was a deist.</P>
<P>Buckingham and Bristol were great promoters of the divorce. They
said, if the duke of York could be persuaded to it, he would be laughed
at and despised by all the world; if he opposed it, they hoped it would
ruin him with the King. Doctor Burnet, a busy, intriguing man, was
one of the divines who wrote for it; and Sir Orlando Bridgman was
consulted about it. The King said that, if his conscience would allow
him to divorce the Queen, it would suffer him to dispatch her out of the
world. Northumberland, Leicester, Hollis, Pierpont, Onslow, and
others met at Guilford about it. Trevanion proposed disbanding an
hundred of the three troops of horse guards, and twenty of each com∣pany
of foot. But the duke of York and Albemarle prevented it.
They endeavoured to get an address, to put the duke out of the admi∣ralty,
and put in others more acceptable to them; but it was dropt.
Sir R. Temple brought in a bill for a triennial parliament. Lady Her∣vey,
daughter of lord Montague, a very witty and intriguing <HI>wench,</HI>
got well with Buckingham and Arlington; and brought lord Trevor
to be secretary.</P>

on the methods to advance the Cath, religion, in his kingdoms. They
met, on 25 of January. The King declared his mind, in matters of
religion, with great zeal to the duke and other three persons, at this
private meeting. The result of the consultation was, that the work
should be done in conjunction with France. The lord Arundel was ac∣cordingly
sent to treat with the French King; and the treaty was concluded
the beginning of the year 1670. The French King was to give 200,000<HI>l.</HI>

troops were well affected. The D. of Buckingham seeks to support him∣self,
by favour of madame, with whom he manages a treaty with France.
He sent over Sir Ellis Leighton to treat with her. Neither the duke nor
Arlington knew any thing of this treaty. The duke, after Leighton's
return, had an account of it from himself. Nor were the generality of
the church of England men, at that time, averse to the R. C. religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King kept the secret of his agreement with
France, and suffered a mock-treaty to go on, that he might the better
cover the real one; of which neither madame nor the duke of Bucking∣ham
had the least knowledge. Buckingham's chief drift was to keep

was kept a secret to the D. of York and Arlington.</P>

<P>About the beginning of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE> in this year, madame, the K.'s only
sister now living, came to Dover to meet her brother, which she long
<PB N="54" REF="64"/>
desired to do; which was now made easy for her, by his Most Christian
Majesty's coming to view his new conquests in Flanders. This journey
proved unfortunate in many respects. The private treaty had been, as
has been mentioned, already signed by both the Kings, and some of
the money paid. The French King, being desirous to change the mea∣sures
taken in the private treaty, sent her to persuade her brother to
begin with the Dutch war. He was formerly averse to her journey;
and monsieur, for reasons of his own. She very willingly undertook
this commission, hoping to ingratiate herself with that King, and to be
more considered in France, by shewing the power she had with the K.
her brother. She had, indeed, a mind to stay in England, not only out
of love to her brother, but she presumed upon his temper and the as∣cendant
she had over him; and believed, that if once she could com∣pass
her living with him, she might govern all things here. The duke
foresaw the ill-consequences of her coming, and did not like it; and as
dexterously as he could, without appearing downright against it, did
almost hinder it. The duke being detained at London, madame, be∣fore
his arrival at Dover, had already prevailed on the King to break
through all the first measures, and to begin with the Dutch war. She
had even gained Arlington and Clifford, and made them concur with
her in the measure.</P>

<P>In May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> madame came to Dover and met the King. The duke of
York was against her coming;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts.</NOTE> and was not present, when she persuaded
the King to a war with Holland. The King was to have fifty men of
war, and France thirty. She got Buckingham restored to the King's
favour, and made him and Arlington friends. She died on the twenty-first
of June, suspected to be of poison. Buckingham was, soon after,
sent to France.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTRACT VI.</HEAD>
<P>Before the duke of York came to Dover, madame had prevailed with
the King to begin with the Dutch war. Arlington and Clifford, gained
by her, concurred in her measures. The duke said, it would unavoid∣ably
run the King in debt, and put him in the mercy of the parliament,
<PB N="55" REF="65"/>
which was not likely to be in a good humour; and that they would not
give sufficient supplies for a war undertaken without their advice, and
in conjunction with France. For these reasons, they would not approve
of it; and it would give them a jealousy of the King's designs. His
Majesty answered, that fifty of his own ships, and thirty from France,
would serve for the war. So that there was no danger of running in
debt. The charge might easily be supported by the customs, estimated
at 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> and, if the war succeeded, it was not much matter what
people suspected. The duke said, though fifty ships might not cost
above 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> yet they could not look the Dutch in the face with
eighty ships, such as proposed, and fire ships proportionable; and keep
convoys for trade and the preservation of plantations, under near as
much more; not to reckon the land forces. Madame reconciled Bucks
to the King and Arlington.</P>
<P>On the twenty-second of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> the news of the duchess of Orleans'
death arrived. It was suspected that counter-poisons were given her.
But when she was opened, in presence of the English ambassador, the
earl of Ailesbury, an English physician and surgeon, there appeared
no grounds of suspicion of any foul play. Yet Bucks talked openly,
that she was poisoned; and was so violent, as to propose to foreign
ministers to make war on France.</P>
<P>Buckingham was sent to France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> in return to the King of France's
compliment by the marechal Bellefonds. The Dutch ambassador and
others were alarmed at it; as it would break the triple alliance.</P>

<P>The ladies, Hervey and Trevor, bullied Arlington to give up the

done as soon as it was possible to turn out the old cavaliers. Sir Wil∣liam
Coventry was so provoked at Buckingham's railleries, as to send
<PB N="56" REF="66"/>
him a challenge, and it turned out a privy council affair, and he was turned
out. Buckingham and Arlington differed. They both courted the
duke of York, who was content to live civilly with the ministers, and
concur for the King's service. But he would not engage with any one;
and, as Buckingham was not to be relied on, he would have nothing to
do with him. Buckingham had sent his confident, Sir Ellis Leighton,
to France privately, to madame, to propose a stricter alliance with France;
and when it was known, he endeavoured to throw it on the duke of
York and Arlington.</P>
<P>Osborne and Littleton endeavoured to get the commissioners of the
navy, who had been put in by the duke of York, turned out. But, on
examining complaints, they shewed their own malice, and ignorance of
naval affairs; and so failed. They opposed Sir Thomas Allen's com∣manding
eighteen ships against the Algerines; and were for Sir Robert
Holmes, because he was ill with the duke of York, who wanted temper
to command a squadron. They opposed Sir Jeremy Smith's being com∣missioner
of the navy, though a fit person and an old commander. But
the King understood sea affairs too well to comply.</P>
<P>Buckingham met with his creatures and confidents, the bishop of
Chester, Sir Thomas Osborne, Sir Ellis Leighton, and others. The
earl of Orery hoped to be made lord lieutenant of Ireland. Arlington
trusted and consulted Sir Thomas Clifford, Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir
Robert Car, and secretary Trevor. The lords wanted to supplant each
other. The fanatics increased in number and strength.</P>
<P>Bucks, upon the occasion of the bill concerning original causes, moved
for a clause, that no peer should be tried but by the whole house of
lords; and had the confidence to say, that the King and the privy council
approved of it. It would, in December, have gone very hard with the
earl of Orery, in the house of commons, had not the King commanded
the duke of York to get those he could influence to put it off; and it
was carried but by two.</P>

The King took notice of it, in December, to the duke, who said she

him keep it private; as it was from all but father Hunt, a Franciscan,
lady Cranmer, woman of her bed-chamber, and Mr. Dupuy, the duke's

<P>At a meeting at lord Arlington's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 26th.</NOTE> the accident which had happened to
Sir J. Coventry was considered. Buckingham proposed to the King, to
send for the commons to the house of lords, on Thursday morning, to
speak about it; as being best to begin with them. The duke of York
seconded him in it; and all present were of the same mind. The King
ordered Buckingham and one or two more to prepare the heads of his
speech, which were read and approved the next day: that he had
heard of what had happened to Coventry, and the occasion of it: that
he disapproved of what was done; and, at the same time, was troubled,
that they had suffered such words to pass, without punishment: that he
expected they would right him; and would ever be tender of letting
them have full liberty of speech: that it concerned them and him, not
to let his or their enemies take advantage to break the parliament; and
concluded with a compliment.</P>

<P>An embargo laid on all vessels outward bound, by which they pro∣posed

all trade, and damage to customs; and undertook to man the fleet
without it, if the Newfoundland trade might be discontinued for that
season; For the main fleet, under his command, he desired only sixty
English ships of the line, with twenty frigates, and thirty French men
of war. Thus, ships and men enough would be left for convoys; and
the war create no interruption to trade. Sir Robert Holmes sent to in∣tercept
the Dutch Smyrna sleet.</P>
<P>De Ruyter, with seventy Dutch men of war, goes to sea, before the
junction of the English and French fleets. The duke of York, on ad∣vice
of the French failing from Brest, and judging, by the winds, they
must be in the channel, failed for the Buoy at the Nore, with the ships
that were ready, fourty, and twelve fire-ships; and was carried, by a
fresh gale at west, down the channel. He had, off Longsand-head, in
<PB N="60" REF="70"/>
the evening, a sight of the Dutch scouts. When he came to the head
of the sands, he stood to the south; and, at the night-fall, the gale
growing fresher, and bad weather likely, came to an anchor all night.
The duke giving, at day-break, the signal for failing, the wind from
east, with a thick fog, he passed by de Ruyter, without seeing or being
seen. The next morning he joined the French at St. Helen's, where he
staid two days to adjust all things; and then failed to look out for the
Dutch fleet, and join the rest of his own.</P>
<P>The duke of York, in the Prince, of a hundred guns, commanded
the red squadron; Sir Edward Sprag, in the London, of a hundred
guns, was his vice admiral; Sir George Harman, in the Charles, his
rear admiral. Comte d'Estrees, vice admiral of the French, in the St.
Philips, between eighty and ninety guns, commanded the white; M. du
Quatre his vice admiral, la Robinier his rear admiral. The earl of Sand∣wich,
in the Royal James, a hundred guns, was admiral of the blue;
Sir Joseph Jordan, in the Sovereign of a hundred guns, was his vice
admiral; and Sir J. Kempshorn, in the St. Andrew of ninety odd guns,
his rear admiral. The duke found, by several ships from the river, that
the Dutch, whom he sought on their own coast, lay behind the Rumble
Sand, in order to draw the English on it. But captain R. Haddock
prevented it. Captain Cook confirmed the intelligence; and the scouts
that were sent experienced it. The duke then stood in, towards the
banks of Flanders. De Ruyter, the best sea commander of his time,
stood in to the banks. He was bred under old Van Tromp. His good
sense was only equalled by his courage. He managed his fleet so, that
the duke could not engage, for a long time, without disadvantage. His
ships drew less water. The weather being very bad, the duke went to
Southwold bay; and the ships that wanted water and provisions anchored
near the shore; as the fire-ships did, to take in fresh ballast. The duke
declared, when the wind turned to the east, that he would get out to
sea; ordering that no coallier or trading ship should be permitted to go
round; left falling into the hands of the enemy's privateers, they might
lie advertised how his fleet lay. Yet a light coallier slipt by, in the
night, and was taken by a privateer and carried to de Ruyter; who, on
the wind's turning east, ordered his fleet to fail at sun-set, in order to
attack the English, at day-break, before they were in order.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71"/>
So soon as the duke found the wind easterly, he was for standing out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Party-writers have entirely misrepresented this fact. They ascribe the surprize to the duke's obstinacy; and mention an unauthorized fiction of his checking with rudeness the earl of Sandwich. The contrary appears to have been the truth.</NOTE>,
to be in a posture to receive the Dutch; and ordered Sir J. Cox, his
captain, to give the signal for the fleet to do so, and to be in the order
of battle. Cox urged, that there was no danger of the enemy's com∣ing
on so soon; their fleet being in the same condition with ours, taking
in stores and provisions: that captain Finch, one of our cruizers, come
newly in from the coast of Holland, had brought no news of their mo∣tion.
The master of the packet-boat, who was just come in, being
brought to the duke, informed him, that he came, the evening be∣fore,
through the Dutch fleet, lying at anchor off Goree; the most of
them with their yards and topmasts down, taking in all sorts of pro∣visions.
So that it was not likely, that they could soon be in a sailing
condition; and that the duke might he twenty-four hours longer, for
supplying his fleet with what they wanted; which could not be done in
several days, if he stood out further from the shore. This was con∣firmed
by the French major and captain Eliot, his assistant, who were
appointed to take in water and other necessaries for the French squadron.
Thus was the duke of York over-persuaded to tarry where he was; and
Cox was so sure, that he brought his ship, the Prince, on the careen, to
give her a pair of boot-hose-tops, to make her sail the better.</P>
<P>Thus, on the twenty-eighth of May, was the duke of York surprized,
about two in the morning. The captain of a French fourth rate, who
had been with captain Finch cruizing on the coast of Holland, brought
him the first news of the Dutch approach. His ship, being a bad sailer,
could not go in as Finch's did to the fleet, the evening before; and, that
he might not be driven to the leeward of it, he was forced to come to
an anchor, about a league to the eastward of the fleet; the wind being
north-east, and a leeward tyde. This gave quicker knowledge of the
enemy. For, as he was getting under sail to join the fleet, two Dutch
scouts fell in with him, and, though of equal force, did not fire upon
him, but brought to and stood from him; which made him judge their
fleet was not far a stern of them. By way of signal to give notice of
<PB N="62" REF="72"/>
the enemy's approach, he fired all the way as he stood in to join the
English fleet, which made it prepare to receive the Dutch. At day∣break
the Dutch fleet was seen to windward, bearing down on us. The
ships of the line and fire-ships, which were nearer in with the shore than the
flag-men, at the first alarm got under sail to place them in their stations,
in the order of battle; but, by reason of the leeward tyde and east wind,
few could get in, when the engagement began. Not above twenty of
the red and blue bore the brunt of de Ruyter and Van Ghent's squa∣drons.
The fight began about eight in the morning; the Dutch having
the wind. The Prince was disabled. The duke of York went then on
board the St. Michael, Sir Robert Holmes captain. The French squa∣dron
was scarce charged, by the Zealand squadron. The earl of Sand∣wich's
ship, the Royal James, was burnt; but captain Haddock was
saved. Two ships, which came to burn the Prince, were sunk. The
duke, returning to refit, was followed by the Dutch, in bravado; but
turning on them again, he pursued them to their own coasts, and left
fifteen of their disabled ships in the rear, which nothing, but a sudden
fog, could have saved from being taken. Foul weather hindered him,
afterwards, from attacking them, till on their own coasts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTRACT III.</HEAD>
<P>De Ruyter had a hard game to play.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE> He was obliged to keep to sea,
so to support the drooping spirits of his countrymen, and to hinder the
deserting of his men, and their getting the same panic in the fleet, that
prevailed ashore. Had he not been qualified, as he was, he could not
so well have fenced against all his difficulties, as he did. He was, in∣deed,
justly esteemed the greatest sea-commander of his time. He was
bred up under old Van Tromp; and had been in all or most of the chief
engagements of the two first Dutch wars. He had very good sense,
equal to his courage, which appeared, upon this occasion, in so managing
his fleet, that although they were so near one another, for so long a
time, the duke could not come to an engagement; without great disad∣vantage
and hazard to his own fleet. For he posted himself so advan∣tageously
for his own fleet, that drew less water than ours, near the coast
of Flanders, and served himself so well of the weather, which was fa∣vourable
to him, that the duke neither could attack him in the morning,
<PB N="63" REF="73"/>
so to make a decisive battle of it, nor far enough off from the sands,
with which they were better acquainted than we were.</P>
<P>Before the battle, in Southwold bay, began, the duke gave orders,
that no one should mention aloud the coming of a fire-ship, for fear of
discomposing the seamen. De Ruyter, after having exchanged some
broadsides with the duke, sent two fire-ships to clap him aboard. Sir
Edward Scot, a land-officer, first discovered the fire-ships. He whis∣pered
it to Sir John Cox. But scarce had Sir John called an officer to
give him orders thereupon, when a great shot struck him dead, and,
at the same time, carried off the head of Mr. Bell, a volunteer. Sir
Edward addressed himself to the duke, who forthwith gave such di∣rections,
as dispatched the first sireship and disabled the other. The duke
with the few ships that were with him, were so plied by De Ruyter,
that his own ship, the Prince, had, before eleven o'clock, her main
top-mast shot by the board, her fore-topsail, her starboard main-shrowds,
and all the rest of her rigging and fighting sails torn to pieces, and above
200 of the crew either killed or wounded. He went down, as between
decks, to order something, he stept into his boat, having previously
given private orders to the captain to tow the Prince out of the line.
The lord Duras, Mr. Henry Savil, Mr. Ashton, and his chief pilot, accom∣panied
him. He went on board the St. Michael, a second rate, com∣manded
by Sir Robert Holmes, that was a-head of him, somewhat to the
leeward; and, for that reason, had not been much damaged. He put
up instantly his flag. But there not being wind enough to spread it, he
was fain to send his boat to give notice where he was. The French,
as I have already said, stood away to the southward, as close haled as
they could. But they were not pressed, as they might have been, by the
Zealand squadron.</P>
<P>When the duke was on board the St. Michael, he was obliged to tack,
on account of a sand athwart of Leostoff, and stood to the southward,
as near as he could lie. He weathered, by that means, De Ruyter
and most of his squadron. But had the Amsterdam squadron still to
windward of him. That squadron had been obliged to tack, for the
same reason. The duke was now between two lines of the Dutch; and
forced to lead the ships of his division, that could get into his wake, and
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
tack after him; which were not many. The rest tacked to leeward of
De Ruyter; so that the enemy and we were much mingled together.</P>
<P>Soon after the duke had stood to the southward, a gentle gale sprung
up at east; and being got clear of the smoak, he would look a little
about him. The first thing he saw was the E. of Sandwich's blue flag,
some distance a-head of him, appearing above the smoak, which was so
great about that place, that one could not see any hulls. Whilst the red
squadron was engaged with De Ruyter and his squadron, the E. of
Sandwich's division was no less hotly engaged with the squadron of Van
Ghent, who with his ship brought to, on the broadside of the earl; whilst,
at the same time, captain Brakel, a bold, hot-headed Dutchman, in a ship
of 70 guns, laid him on board, athwart the hause; by which means,
raking him fore and aft, they together destroyed him a world of men;
which obliged the earl, that he might get rid of so troublesome a neigh∣bour,
to order his men to enter Brakel's ship. This they did, with swords,
half-pikes, and pistols; and, after some resistance, they mastered her.
Though this gave the earl some ease, Van Ghent and his seconds so
plied his ship, the Royal James, and had slain and disabled so many of
his men, that he was obliged to recal those who had mastered Brakel's
ship.</P>
<P>He immediately sent to ask the advice of his captain, (captain Had∣dock)
who having been wounded in the foot, was then dressing in the
hold. By his advice he came to an anchor, by one fixed for such acci∣dents
out of the gun-room. This had the desired effect. But it proved,
in part, the destruction of the Royal James. For besides that she was,
at the very beginning of the engagement, somewhat to windward of her
own division, so by coming then to anchor, they drove farther from
her, and the enemy came nearer to her. At this instant Van Ghent was
slain, by one of her shot. But that did not hinder the enemy from still
pressing hard upon her. They sent a fire-ship upon her, which she sunk
before she could reach her.</P>
<P>The earl was now no longer at an anchor. For soon after he was
clear of Brakel's ship, he cut the cable that was out of his gun-room.
After which, when he had almost got clear off from amongst the Dutch,
another fire-ship came upon him. He endeavoured to bear up. But
<PB N="65" REF="75"/>
his ship was so much disabled, that he could not do it; and so the fire∣ship
laid her on board to windward, on her larboard side, and burnt
her. This the duke beheld with sorrow. But he could not help,
being to the leeward of her, though he passed close by her, and saw
the sea covered with her men; some sinking, some swimming, and
others buoying themselves up, upon what they could next catch hold
of. Hereupon he ordered the Dartmouth, which was just come up to
him, to ly by, and save all she possibly could. She and some of the boats of
the line which followed the duke, made a shift to pick up 2 or 300, of
which number were captain Haddock, lieutenant Mayo, the master, and
one Lowd, a servant of the E. of Sandwich, whom the King made a
page of the bed-chamber, as soon as he came to London. The earl
was not so fortunate; for he was drowned, and his body being after∣wards
found, was honourably buried in Henry the Seventh's chapel.</P>
<P>The duke's ship, the St. Michael, was so leaky, that she now had
five feet of water in her hold. The Phoenix, the Resolution, and the
Cambridge came up seasonably to his relief. Van Ghent's squadron bore
down on the duke. They, however, brought to, and contented themselves
to ply him very hard with their great guns. The reason was, that the
captain who succeeded Van Ghent, was killed at first, and he who
came next in command had not the resolution to follow his plan. Van
Nesse, the elder, who carried a flag in the main-top, being to leeward
of the duke, after he had tacked, and cut between De Ruyter and the
Amsterdam squadron, stretched out a-head with some of De Ruyter's
squadron; and tacked again and stood stern-lings with the duke; de∣signing
to weather him, and bring up some fire-ships he had with him.
But when the Stavern, one of his seconds which led him, had got
up with the broadside of the duke, Van Nesse's heart failed him; and
instead of following the ship a-head of him, which was one of fifty
odd guns, commanded by capt. Elzivir, he tacked and stood away, with
his fire-ships. He left the Stavern behind him. She was disabled by
the St. Michael. She at length yielded to the Greenwich, a fourth rate,
captain Green commander.</P>
<P>By this time the St. Michael having so much water again in her hold,
made leeward way; so that the Dutch being also to the leeward, she at
<PB N="66" REF="76"/>
last came within musket-shot of their squadron. As she passed by the
Dutch vice admiral's second, the duke raked her fore and aft.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Spragg, with some of his division, was now got a-head
of the duke. The E. of Ossory, in the Victory, who had till now
kept in his station, a-stern of the duke, was so disabled, that he was
forced to bear away to refit. Capt. George Legg, in the Fairfax, a third
rate, took his place. It was now five o'clock in the afternoon. Sir
Robert Holmes informed the duke, that the St. Michael was so much
disabled, that she could no longer continue in the line. She had lost a
great many men. Her sails, masts, and rigging were in a shattered con∣dition.
She had such a quantity of water in her hold, that she must
have sunk, if she did not lie by to stop her leaks. The duke resolved to
go on board the London, Sir Edward Spragg's ship. He, at the same
time, desired Holmes not to strike the standard, till he saw it flying
a-board the London, lest the disappearing of it, for any time, might
discourage his own fleet. This was found to be a necessary precaution:
for, by the freshening of the gale, the London had got so far a-head,
that it was three quarters of an hour before he got on board her.</P>
<P>When the duke came on board the London, he found her also much
disabled, especially in her head-sails; having had to deal with Van Nesse
the younger, a rear admiral, who was to windward of her. He swagged
apace down upon her. But, at this time, being seven in the evening,
De Ruyter made a signal to all his ships, that were to windward of him,
to bear down to him. He himself bore away to join the Zealand squa∣dron,
who were still engaged with the French. He came down, on the
Rainbow, an old second rate. Capt. Storer, her commander, obliged
him to stand out a-head of him; De Ruyter not thinking it safe to lay
him on board. This motion of the Dutch gave Sir John Jordan an
opportunity to join the duke with 5 or 6 ships. The duke had now
with him about 25 ships to windward of the Dutch. The rest having
joined the French, were to leeward of the enemy. This was the po∣sition
of the fleets at sun set: and thus ended this memorable day, in
which the Dutch, with all the advantage they could desire, of surprize
and wind, and of number of ships that engaged, were far from victory
over the English; as their being the first to leave the sea, and retiring into
<PB N="67" REF="77"/>
their harbours, will hereafter make fully evident. The night was spent
in refitting. The duke went again on board the Prince. In a council
of the flag officers, it was resolved, that the fleet should return. The
Dutch, out of bravado, following the English, the duke turned upon them,
and pursued them to their own coast. The Dutch were saved by a fog.</P>

<P>The duke of York proposed sailing to Weelings to fight De Ruyter
there.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts.</NOTE> But Shaftesbury and others persuaded the King to send the fleet
to intercept the Dutch East India fleet, then expected home by the north
of Scotland, which might otherwise escape, whilst the duke looked after
De Ruyter. The duke thought the best way was to drive De Ruyter
into harbour; because, if he was at sea, it would be dangerous to spread
our ships, in order to intercept the East India fleet, lest the enemy should
come upon them on a sudden. For De Ruyter would easily know our
stations. The duke cruized between the Vly and the Texel. He an∣chored
there, for near a fortnight, in bad weather; and then cruized
towards the Dogger-sands. The Cambridge, one of his cruizers, boarded
an East Indiaman, but it blew so hard, that he could not master her;
and the storm increasing, the whole fleet got by before the duke could
be advertised.</P>
<P>After the duke returned to court, Shaftesbury was made chancellor,
and Clifford treasurer. Arlington was discontented, because he did not
get the staff. But the King said, he had too much kindness for him to

him, it would be his ruin, and expose him to the malice of his enemies.</P>

<P>Shaftesbury, in all the revolutions from 1641, was famous for turn∣ing
from side to side; still foremost in the several turns of government,

bold asserter of prerogative. He had the chief hand, in declaring for
liberty of conscience. He promoted the second Dutch war. He advised
shutting up the exchequer. He justified all proceedings to parliament.

though he was too fond of Monmouth, who was made general

<HEAD>1674. EXTRACT I.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of York, in the house of lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674. Jan. 14th.</NOTE> told them, that the reason
he had not yet taken the oath of allegiance, was not for any scruple he
had to take it; the meanest subject his Majesty had not being readier to
testify his obedience to him than he was; but he doubted whether he
was to take it, since it was plain that prince Henry had not done it;
and that, by authentic records, other princes had been exempted from
taking it. Being unwilling to do any thing, that might give reason to
any who might come after him, and be in the same post, to complain,
that he had lost them a privilege, which he might have retained if he
pleased; he desired, for his own justification and satisfaction, their opi∣nion
and judgment in it. At first, it was proposed to refer it to a
committee of the privy council. But the duke seeing, by the debate,
that many lords were of opinion he ought not to have the same privilege
as the prince, desired them not to give themselves the trouble, that he
acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sced and would take it; having done his part, in making his
claim; and would not stand upon it. He took it, as soon as the house
adjourned.</P>
<P>After the King's message, about the Dutch offers for peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th.</NOTE> the earl
of Salisbury moved for a bill, to breed the duke of York's children in
the religion of the church of England. The earl of Carlisle seconded
this motion; and moved further for a bill, that the King, nor none of
the royal blood to such a degree, might marry, without the consent of
parliament. Halifax moved, the disarming all Roman Catholics and
reputed ones; and lord Mordaunt, that all English priests might be re∣moved
from the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="82"/>
The articles of peace with the Dutch were signed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9th</NOTE> at London, on the
ninth of February. It had been negotiated, concluded, and signed, by
the marquis de Fresno, the Spanish ambassador, who had full powers
from the Dutch, for that purpose. Next day, in the debate, in the
house of Lords, about the clause proposed in a bill to hinder any of the
blood from marrying a Roman Catholic, without the consent of parlia∣ment,
Carlisle and Halifax proposed, that the penalty should be the
declaring them incapable of succession; for which being reproved
by lord Peterborrow, who termed it “a horrid notion,” he was an∣swered
by Shaftesbury, that it was not so horrid. He spoke for it, he
said, not as a thing he desired should look backward, but forward;
and for which there had been precedents. But his discourse and prece∣dents
were severely answered by the lord-keeper, who said it was stretch∣ing
their liberty and freedom of speech to the utmost, to hold such dis∣course
as they had held. He spoke very well and home to the whole
matter, proving it against law; and he shewed the bad effects things of
that nature had had in this nation. The bishop of Winton, and other
bishops, spoke, to shew how any thing of the nature was against the
rules of Christianity in general, and especially against the doctrine of the
church of England; and, at last, the proposition was laid aside, with
scorn. The heads resolved on were, in general, that the King, nor none
of the blood, within such a degree, should marry a papist, without the
consent of parliament, and no penalty put upon it.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th</NOTE> the parliament was prorogued, to
the tenth of November. This resolution was carried so close, that none of
the Commons believed it would be done, expecting only to be told
of a recess, in eight or ten days; and they looked very discontented,
when it was done. No bill of any kind had passed both houses; and
but one private and two public ones were sent up from the house of
commons. One of each kind only was sent from the lords. Shaftesbury
and Carlisle were to propose to the house of lords the disbanding of
the duke of York's regiment.</P>
<P>Shaftesbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> pretending fear of having his throat cut, by the Roman
Catholics, lay one night, at least, in the city, at the house of one Cook,
a fanatic; and, both then and before, he did all he could to promote
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
petitioning his Majesty to call a parliament, for the redress of griev∣ances.
He endeavoured to get the lord mayor to consent to the com∣mon
council's meeting once a month; and had it even proposed, in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t of aldermen. But the lord mayor would not consent; and said,
they should not use him as the King had been used. The King sent Sir
Paul Neal to Shaftesbury, to let him know, that he heard he was about
to take a house in the city, to live there. He forbade him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his peril,
looking on it as a design to do there as he had done in parliament; and
that he would do well to go down to the country, as soon as the weather
would permit. Shaftesbury answered, that he had no design.</P>
<P>The duke of York told Monmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17th</NOTE> who was with him in the even∣ing,
that he feared Arlington. Though he was about to quit the place
of secretary of state, for the white staff, he would still have some part
in affairs; and, by his fearful councils, ruin the King's affairs, as he had
already done. He knew it was his design to ruin the good understand∣ing
between them. Monmouth answered, that he could not believe he
had such evil intentions, else he would have nothing to do with him.
The duke of York made him suitable returns and parted; conjuring
him, at the same time, to have a care of Arlington's practices. The
same night, after supper, Monmouth came to the duke, and desired him
to move the King, for his having a commission as general, during plea∣sure
only; and to liee by him, not to make use of at present, but in case
of any disorder. This he desired, because he had been told by some
officers, that, if any thing should happen, they could not obey him, nor
fire on any, unless he had such authority to command. The duke an∣swered,
he did not see it was necessary for that reason only; since al∣ready,
by his commission of captain of the King's troop of horse-guards,
he was empowered to command all the troops now on foot, as eldest
colonel. That he believed a commission of general could give him no
more power. For the words of killing and slaying would not be in any
new commission, more than in that he had already; they not having
been used in the late general's commission. That it was a misinforma∣tion
of those who persuaded him to desire it on that ground; and any
such officer as had said this to him, or should make any such differences,
did not deserve to be one, or to have a military employment, that could
be so foolishly scrupulous. Neither lord Craven's regiment nor the

queen's troop had any such differences, on the disorders of Whit∣Tuesday;
and on Monmouth's saying they had orders to do what they
did, the duke put him in mind, that they could have none, being acci∣dentally
drawn up in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, when the disorders began;
and they fell upon the rabble and dispersed that part of them, before
orders could come. Monmouth insisting on it still, the duke of York
told him plainly, that he would never speak to the King about it, non∣consent
there should be any general, as it was a post not fit for any
body in the time of peace; and, on the duke of Albemarle's death, he
had advised the King against it, when there was no thought of a duke
of Monmouth.</P>
<P>The King told the duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13th.</NOTE> he thought it would be necessary
for his service to give the duke of Monmouth a commission for lieute∣nant-general,
to capacitate him to command all the troops, else incon∣veniences
might happen, on some refusing to obey him, in case of a
sudden rising. The duke said, he thought his Majesty had taken a
resolution to the contrary, when the late general died; and, besides,
there was no necessity for it, as Monmouth was already captain of the
guards.</P>
<P>Sir R. T.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 20th</NOTE> told the duke of York what he had heard, from
another hand: That, at a meeting at lord Mordant's, at Parson's green,
it had been resolved, by that gang, to get such a vote against him, as
that against Buckingham and Lauderdale, at the first meeting of par∣liament.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th.</NOTE> the King told the duke of York,
in Lauderdale's presence, that he had just come from speaking with
Howard, who had told him news out of Holland; and, among the
rest, that the prince of Orange had said, he heard, Arlington de∣signed
to persuade the King to own the duke of Monmouth his legiti∣mate
son; on which, the King said to Howard, that it was true, one
person, <HI>Sbaftesbury,</HI> once had the impudence to come near proposing it
to him; but he had answered it as became him. He told him, he could

of York opposed Arlington's going, as he was too much a friend to the
prince, to make a faithful report; and, a day or two after, when the
King told him, that lord Ossory was to go and offer the princess Mary
in marriage to the prince, he was against the commission; since the
prince ought first to seek her. The King said, lord Ossory was to say

him of it. The duke acquiesced, in his pleasure.</P>

<P>The house of commons pressed the King to a war with France. The
second test was contrived to get the duke of York removed from the
King's presence, and even from the succession. It was to contain a re∣nunciation
of many other tenets held by Roman Catholics; none to
come into the King's presence, without leave first obtained, under the
hands of six privy councillors. But the duke's friends, by a majority of
two, got a clause to except him; which put Shaftesbury so much out of
humour, that he said he did not care what became of the bill. He
urged against the duke's succession, by divorcing the King, and setting
up the duke of Monmouth.</P>
<P>Monmouth, who was bred a Roman Catholic, under the name of

<P>The duke of Monmouth had been bred, in France, a Roman Catho∣lic,
under father Gough, an English oratorian. His tutor, Thomas
Ross, a Scotsman, put the thoughts of legitimacy into his head; and
would have bishop Cozens to certify, that he had married the King and
Mrs. Walters, who refused it, with indignity, and gave immediate no∣tice
of it to the King, who removed Ross from about him. Mrs.
Walters, for that was her true name, was born of Welch parents, very
handsome, little wit and some cunning. Colonel Algernoon Sidney,
who was then a colonel under Oliver Cromwell, trafficked for her first;
and was to have had her for fifty broad pieces. This I had from his own
mouth. But, being commanded hastily out of London to his regiment, he
missed her; and the went to Holland, where his brother, Robert Sidney,
lighted on her and kept her, for some time. The King, being then at the
Hague, heard of her, and got her from him, who said, at the same time,
these words to some of his friends, “Let who will have her, she is already
sped.” And after her being with the King, she proved so soon with
child, and came so near the time, that the world had cause to doubt,
whose son Monmouth was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE>. When he grew a man, he proved the likest
thing to him I ever saw, even to a very wart on his face. After she had this
child, she kept so little measure with the King, and lived so loosely when
he was in Scotland, that when, after the Worcester fight, he came to
France and she came thither, he would have no further commerce with
her. She used, in vain, all her little arts. She tried to persuade
doctor Cozens that she was a convert, and would quit her scandalous
way of life; and had, at the same time, a child, by the earl of Carling∣ton,
who grew up to be a woman, and was owned by the mother to be
hers; as like the earl as possible. When the King went to Germany,
she imposed on Sir H. V. the King's resident at Brussels, to go along
with her to Cologne, and ask leave to marry him. But all being in

after the restoration, of the disease incident to her profession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When James was in Ireland, in 1690, he employed some part of his time in drawing up instructions for his son.

But he has left only general heads of what he intended to say, about the government of this country, and the manner of regulating the several departments, and filling the great offices of state. He gives very sensible directions about the navy, as the bulwark and glory of the kingdom. He desires him to have the treasury always in com∣mission; never to have a lawyer lord chancellor. To have neither lord high admiral nor commissioners, but a secretary of state, for that department, which always ought to be the chief care, and, therefore, must be under the immediate inspection of a King of England. He recommends to him to have four secretaties of state; of whom only one, should the test be repealed, ought to be a Roman Catholic, one a Presbyterian, and two of the church of England.</P>
<P>He desires him, in a particular manner, not to be too much attached to women. He gives several instances of the fatal consequences of such connexions to princes, and to their kingdoms. Many of them died without lawful heirs, and were ungratefully used by their natural children. He acknowledges, with shame and regret, that he himself was too much a slave to that passion. Almost every thing, he says, will apply to his brother, although he professes, from a regard to his memory, to speak in general terms. He gives him, however, as a strong instance of the disadvantages arising from keeping mistresses. Though he used them with kindness and liberality, they had no fixed regard for his person. The factious and discontented always gained them over to their interest, which he instances, in “a certain lady;” by whom he means the duchess of Portsmouth. “If you have daughters,” says he, “you will be obliged to give them portions, and to provide them with husbands, whom you must dignify with honours, or enrich with places.

The late King, my brother, who had the misfortune to be very much addicted to that fatal vice, had children by all his owned mistresses, and none by his Queen. Besides which, he had the mortification to have had the duke of Mon∣mouth, whom he believed to be his son (though all the knowing world, as well as my∣self, had many convincing reasons to think the contrary; and that he was Robert Sidney's) fly in his face, and join with the earl of Shaftesbury and the factious party, in the design they had to seize his person, and rise in rebellion against him; though, at the same time, he showed him all the tenderness of a father, and the kindness of a friend, doing things for him, which ought to have made him give a better return than he did.”</P>

When Monmouth came over, with the Queen-mother, he was called
young Mr. Crefts; pretending to be lord Crofts's son. But not long
after, he was owned, and made duke of Monmouth; bred a protestant,
married to the earl of Buccleugh's daughter, an heiress of ten thousand
pounds a year. As he grew up the King's kindness increased. He was
very handsome, well-shaped, a good air, a favourite of the ladies. The
duke of York was always kind to him, till he found his designs. Mon∣mouth
had cunning and insinuating ways, when he had a mind to please.
He went with the duke of York to the Dutch war when Opdam was
blown up. The King bought the earl of Macclesfield's first troop of
guards for him. He sent him in the second Dutch war to serve in
Flanders, by land, as lieutenant general, at the siege of Mastricht;
and young Churchill with him. He behaved well, at the retaking the

pleasure. In the summer of 1674, he desired the duke of York to get
the King to make him lieutenant-general. The duke declined it, as un∣necessary;
since, as captain of the guards, he actually commanded all
the forces in England, when drawn into the field; and he had, on the
duke of Albemarle's death, declared his opinion against a general in
chief, it being an office he thought too great for himself. But Monmouth
still intrigued for it. He had then thirty thousand pounds a year coming
in, yet not satisfied. He fell out with the earl of Danby, for not comply∣ing
with his desires of getting money from the crown. He struck the
word <HI>natural</HI> out of a warrant for the King to sign, for a commission
under the great seal, appointing him general, which stopped his patent
of general, for life, in Scotland.</P>
<P>There was a copy of the treaty of Nimeguen signed, in the prince of

The English forces were sent to garrison, in Newport, Ostend, Bruges,
and other places. Some went as far as Brussels; and more were ordered
to be in readiness. The duke of York was preparing to go over. Mon∣mouth
went to Flanders, in time enough to be in the action of St.
Dennis and Chasteau, near Mons. In this voyage, he began to take
measures with the prince of Orange, and lay the ground work of what
he afterwards undertook. By little arts and mean compliances, he
gained the prince of Orange's favour; promising to stand by him,
whenever he should have occasion, in England. He endeavoured to
gain an interest in the English and Scotch troops in the States service;
and succeeded with very many officers and soldiers.</P>
<P>The parliament, not content with stripping the duke of York of his
posts, by the first test, resolved, by an additional act, to drive him from
the King's presence. But they were disappointed. The duke's friends,
in the house, moving to exempt him from that part of the penalties,
it was carried by two votes, which came that morning into the house,
Sir Charles Gaudy and Sir Anthony Dean. Shaftesbury, hearing of it,
declared he did not now care what became of the bill. Yet he left not
off the design, but carried it at last, by the help of the earl of Danby,
the treasurer; whose friend the duke had been before, though it was
against his will he had been made treasurer of the navy. But seeing him
serve with care and fidelity in the office, he grew his friend; and had so
good an opinion of him and his capacity, that, when Clifford laid down,
he recommended him to the King for treasurer, as the fittest person. He
did it very well, and served the King with great vigour and fidelity, till
he took distaste at what the King did in favour of Buckingham.</P>
<P>The faction, seeing the King had more friends and interest in the house
of commons than they cared for, thought to break the parliament, on
a nicety of law and custom of parliaments. This they designed to ef∣fect
at the first meeting of the house; and were, some time before, very
industrious in going about it, and speaking to lords of all sorts to bring
it about; pretending they would prove the parliament dissolved. They
sent lord Wharton to the duke of York, who, though of the party,
pretended kindness for him, out of friendship and gratitude, the duke
having, some years before, saved him from being ruined, to endeavour
to persuade him, that the parliament was actually dissolved, and give his
reasons for it. The duke said, he should hear those reasons in the de∣bate,
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
and would judge who spoke with most reason. Shaftesbury <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d
Hollis spoke with Arundel of Wardour, Bellasis, and most of the Ro∣man
Catholic lords, to persuade them to join with them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the rest of the Roman Catholics. But they would not comply. The
turbulent party urged their arguments with so much heat and sedition,
that Buckingham, Salisbury, Shaftesbury, and Wharton were sent by the
lords to the Tower, to remain during the King's, pleasure. But, not long
after, on petitioning the King, and owning the fault, they were released.
Wharton stayed somewhat longer than the rest, because he chicaned,
and had no mind to own his fault in plain terms. But, seeing no re∣medy,
he did it either in that or the next session.</P>
<P>Another great and warm debate happened in the house of lords,
on a bill brought in or proposed by the earl of Danby, and suffered by
the court and episcopal party, by which no peer was to sit or vote in
the house, that did not take the oaths or test, not to endeavour any al∣teration
in church or state, as then settled. The party, especially the four
lords who were sent to the Tower, the duke of Monmouth, and Hal∣lifax
opposed it; and Shaftesbury and Hollis pressed again the two Ro∣man
Catholic lords, Arundel of Wardour, and Bellasis, to join with
them in opposing it, as all the Roman Catholic lords would not agree.
They said, it was not prudent for any of them to irritate the King, who
might execute the laws against them, and find means to turn them out
of the house; and, perhaps, their party might give a helping hand to
it. Shaftesbury swore, he and his friends never would; and wished his
tongue might cleave to the roof of his mouth, if he ever spake for so
unjust a thing. Yet not above two or three Roman Catholic lords joined
with the party; and these, in another debate, proposed, that an ad∣dition
to the standing rules of the house of lords should be constantly
read, at the first sitting of every parliament; declaring that no peer
was to lose his place or seat in the house, by reason of any oath ten∣dered
to him. But, on this, the bill was laid aside.</P>

should have Roussillon, all Sicily, and twelve millions of livres ready
money; which would put her in a condition to recover Portugal, and
four millions for Don John himself: that Fribourg should be restored to
the emperor, with some places in Alsace. On the same day, the French

The King said, it was time enough yet to consider what was to be done
in that case.</P>
<P>The commonwealth party expected, that in this parliament the mi∣nisters
would be impeached; grievances make a great noise; no money
given, without sacrificing some great officer, or parting with some great
flower of the crown; and, the truth is, the prospect was dismal enough.
Great disorders were hoped for. Vast crowds of old rump officers and
others were at the opening of it. The four lords probably expected fer∣mentations,
or they had not been so resolute. For their friends, in the
house of lords, the marquis of Winchester, the lords Halifax and Hollis
advised them not to trust that point of the parliament being dissolved,
by a fifteen months prorogation; telling them they would miscarry in
it, and only bring inconveniences to themselves. Their ill success
frightened their friends and party, that they durst not fall on the mini∣sters;
and they could neither hinder the giving money to build ships,
nor the additional excise for three years: all they could do was to ad∣dress
for a war with France.</P>

The duke of Monmouth met with the lord Russel and Montague,

York out of England. His answer was, that he could not save him.
The duke of York was more generous.</P>
<P>In April, 1678, a little before the parliament met, lord Russel and
other considerable men in the party, sent to the duke of York to let him
know, that if he would trust and join with them, in what they should
propose for the good of the King and the nation, they would undertake
to remove the incapacity he was under of being high admiral, or exer∣cising
any public office; and do any thing else for his satisfaction. But,
in return, they expected his concurrence with them, in prosecuting the
treasurer. The duke said, he would join with them for the King or the
nation's good; but to fall on the King's minister, without his consent,
unless more visibly guilty of some great misdemeanor, which did not
appear to him, he thought it contrary both to the good of the King and
the nation; and, therefore, could not join with them. He advised
them to take other measures.</P>
<P>Otes's plot.—He had gone to St. Omers, and, under pretence of becom∣ing
a jesuit, had been admitted into the jesuit's college there, till turned
out for insincerity and other crimes; and, enraged at the jesuits, he
came into England, and pretended to have discovered a plot, though
never was any thing so improbable. It was founded on such reports, as
had kindled a rebellion, in 1641. The King was against communicat∣ing
Tong's information to the duke of York, till it was thoroughly
examined. But he came to hear of it, by the letters sent to Mr. Be∣dingfield
at Windsor. When Otes was examined, he began his narrative,
with such assurance, and accompanied it with such circumstances, as
would have imposed almost upon any body. But the cross examination
shewed the villainy. Otes said, he knew the hands of those, from whom
the pretended letters came; and a line of each being shewed him, he
told whose they were. But there was no similitude between them and
the papers of Ireland and Fenwick. Ireland was in England, when his
last letter was dated from St. Omers; and had not, of a long time, been
beyond sea. Tong's deposition was in the same hand with Blundel's
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
letter. So Tong and Otes were the contrivers. Otes wrote one him∣self.
None of these letters were produced at the trials.</P>
<P>They were all full of false spelling, no points, no marks of distinction,
no air of coming from men of business. Treason was wrote, in plain
terms. Five persons of different places and nations could not agree to
write their own names false the same way, the same false English, and
wrote on paper that had the same mark and the same size; agree in the
same cant and affectation; which, on examination, was found all to be
so. Nothing but inspiration could work this miracle. On the contrary,
whoever compares the periods, the manner of expression, and strokes of
the pen, with Otes' and Tong's original papers, will find they all came
out of the same mint. What Otes said of Don John had as little re∣semblance
of Spanish forms, as his description had to his person; and
when Mr. Kirby blamed Otes for so gross a mistake, he replied, by way
of excuse, he might well give a wrong description of a man he had never
seen in his life. His contradictions about the Jesuits house. Arundel and
Bellasis were to be acquainted with it. But he did not say they knew
what he afterwards accused them for. He did not particularly accuse
any lord, till he had been before the house of commons and saw how
they relished it; nor did he till then give them their different employ∣ments,
which they were very unfit for. The Queen and the duke of
York were not accused till a considerable time after. Otes, before the
house of lords, declared on oath, that he had no accusation against any
person of whatsoever quality, but who he then named. Yet, a fortnight
after, he accused the queen. William Colman was examined in council.
Otes told the chancellor, he had never seen him before; yet he told
another story afterwards. He said he was trusted with the jesuits great∣est
secrets; yet they would not trust him with money for his coach hire,
when he went to Dover, but sent Grove with him to pay it. He had
delivered so many commissions, yet kept not one for a proof, though
he intended from the first to discover all. He swore, that so many arms
were bought, yet none were ever found. Armies, he said, were raised,
yet none appeared.</P>
<P>The plot was designed to destroy the duke of York; whom, in par∣liament
and in his information, Otes calls a rascal, papist, and traitor.
“He shall, be hanged; and I hope to live to see it. We will have
<PB N="88" REF="100"/>
no more regard for him, than for a scavenger of Kent-street. It is to be
hoped, we shall see him at the bar of the house of commons, where
many better men than he have been. If the devil has a hotter place in
hell than another, I hope he will bestow it on him.” These were the
flowers of his eloquence. Yet this language was borne. The King dis∣covered
villainy from the first, and would have nipped it in the bud,
had he not been diverted from it by the treasurer, who would lay it
before parliament; and it was catched at and swallowed, with such
greediness, that all contradiction was impossible. The first of Septem∣ber
was appointed, by parliament, to execute the penal laws.</P>
<P>On the second of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> Shaftesbury moved the house of lords,
that the duke of York might absent himself from council and business.
The King, at first, directed his servants to oppose it; but, soon after, he
desired the duke to abstain, who did it out of obedience. The house of
lords, on the eighth of November, addressed that the duke should with∣draw
from court. The King endeavoured to stop their career. On the
thirtieth, the duke was excepted out of the act. Sir Edmund Bury God∣frey's
death <HI>felo de se.</HI> Five hundred pounds were offered for a discovery.
This reward made Bedloe come to one Brewer, for a description of God∣frey's
person. So, on the eighth of November, he deposed, that Godfrey
was murdered in Somerset-house, by the lord Bellasis direction. That
himself, with some fellows, had decoyed him into the court, where others,
suddenly rushing on him out of a door, forced him into the house and
murdered him. That his body lay there two days, and was at last car∣ried
to the place where it was found. The King was at Somerset-house,
at the time Bedloe laid the murder. This made him doubt it, and send
the duke of Monmouth with Bedloe to Somerset house, to shew him the
place where every thing passed. On his return, the duke told the King,
that the Queen's back-stairs was the place where Bedloe said the body
lay. The King was there, a centry at every door, a foot company on
guard; yet no body saw or heard any thing. The King was so sensible
of villainy, that he did not care to prolong Bedloe's pardon.</P>
<P>The house of commons' business was to defeat the succession. So, on
the twenty-fifth of November, the Queen was accused. Ossory and
Bridgewater were sent with Otes, to shew them the place where the
Queen said the words charged. He directed them first to the guard∣room,
<PB N="89" REF="101"/>
then to the privy-chamber; out of which, he said, she went up a
pair of back stairs to a great room. Whereas there were neither any
such stairs thereabouts, nor any large room in that story.</P>
<P>The duke of Monmouth began, now, to set up for himself. He held
cabals with the lord Russel, Sir Henry Capel, Mountague and others;
and Sir Thomas Armstrong said, on several occasions, that Monmouth
assured him the King had promised to declare him prince of Wales, and
if the King died he had four witnesses ready to swear, that the King was
married to Mrs. Barlow. The King was acquainted with it by the
treasurer, and reproved Monmouth; but he did not change his conduct.
Colonel Birch moved the treasurer to persuade the King to it; but was

a broken merchant, that he had a terrible plot of murdering the King to
discover, by night to the King. He charged the jesuits with the plot,
as related in papers given to the lord-treasurer. Mr. Bedingfield brought

said he did; and the court making the clerks shew him a line of each
letter, the rest being folded up, he presently said they were Ireland and
Fenwick's hand-writing. Both these denied it; and several papers of
theirs taken with them being compared, they were proved not to be the
same. When Otes said they were counterfeit hands, they denied it too,
or that they knew ought of their contents; and as to Ireland's letter,
dated from St. Omers, in August last, he proved that he was in England
at that time, and had not been beyond sea of a great while. Blundel's
letter appeared to be in the same hand with Tong's deposition; other

The duke of York pressed his return; but the King refused. The King

<P>The King treated with the French ambassador not to obstruct his

might find his account in it; so far, at least, as to be able to live without

consent might be first had; he having used some sharp expressions against
France. So Sunderland acquainted the duke with it; but before the duke's
answer, the King fell ill, on the twenty-second of August, and sent for
him; who came, and thanked the duchess of Portsmouth and all the
ministers, who were privy to his being sent for.</P>

had a severe fit of an intermitting fever. On this, Sunderland had ad∣vised
with Feversham, Halifax, Hyde, Godolphin, the duchess of Ports∣mouth,
and agreed to send for the duke immediately. The King, on
proposal, agreed to it: But all this was to be kept a secret; and he
was to say, that he came of his own accord. So he came very privately,
Sir R. Bulstrode was sent to tell the duke of Villa Harmosa, then at
Namur, the reason. Essex knew of his being sent for, and approved
of it; but none of the duke of Monmouth's cabal. He got to Wind∣sor,

<P>On the eighth of September, N. S. the duke of York began his journey
from Brussels to England, on advice from the lord Feversham and
others, that the King was in danger of an ague, and advising him to
come as privately as possible, that it might not be known at court, till
he arrived at Windsor. He told it only to the duchess; taking Peter∣borough
and Churchill along with him. He came from Calais, in a
French shallop, to Dover; where he was not known, but to Portman,
an honest man, who kept the secret. He left Peterborough, and rode
post, with Churchill, to London. He took a coach at Southwark, and
went to Phil. F. at the Post-office, and lay all night at Sir Allen
Apsley's near St. James's; and got to Windsor as the King waked,
being better by the Jesuit's powder. The duke of Monmouth, who
was then at court, had gone to hunt in the morning; and Sunderland;
though he knew of the duke's coming, denied it positively to Mon∣mouth.
The King received him kindly; but would not let him stay
long, all the ministers being against him. The duke returned, in a
yaucht, to Ostend; and arrived at Brussels, the first week of October,
N. S. He took the duchess, the princesses Anne and Isabella, to see the
princess of Orange in Holland; leaving the gross of his family at Brus∣sels.
They staid a short time at the Hague, then embarked at Maes∣landsluys,
in a yaucht, for London; and, about the end of October, the
duke went by land to Scotland; leaving his two daughters at St.

<P>When the King told Monmouth he must go abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> he shewed his

of the guards, he desired that his troop of guards might be given to the
duke of Grafton. But he came next morning, with more submission;
declaring himself ready to obey orders, and set out that night from Lon∣don.
He however, held a conference, that evening, with his factious
cabal. It was resolved, that the duke of York should go. Secretary
Coventry proposed to Scotland, rather than Brussels. Sunderland and
the King came into it; only thought the duke should go first to Brussels
for the duchess, and then go straight to Scotland. But Sunderland and
some others assured him privately, that, if he came back to court, he
should not be obliged to go to Scotland at all.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT IX.</HEAD>
<P>It was now necessary to prepare for the meeting of parliament: So
Sunderland, Essex, Halifax, Hyde, and Godolphin, thought it proper,
that the duke should return to Flanders; on condition, that Monmouth
was sent out of England. The commission of general of Scotland and
England taken from him; and he himself sent away. He continues his
correspondence with Shaftesbury, Mountague, &amp;c. The next day, the
King, in presence of the above lords, declared his resolution to the duke
of York; when Monmouth, in a heat, told the King, that he did not
think it proper for him to keep the command of the horse-guards, since
he was no longer general; and he desired, that the duke of Grafton
might have his troop. Next morning, he came in better temper, and
told the King, that he was ready to submit to what he ordered; and,
that evening, he went to London, where yet he had a private meeting
with Mr. Mountague and other disaffected persons; giving out, that this
disgrace befel him, because he was for the King's agreeing with the par∣liament,
and because he was a protestant. This being publickly dis∣coursed,
some of the duke's old friends were much against his going;
especially secretary Coventry, who spoke to the King, in vain, for the
duke's stay. Sunderland was of the same mind. Essex and Halifax
<PB N="96" REF="108"/>
were for his going; and Mr. Hyde for his stay. Godolphin was for his
going, since Monmouth was gone.</P>
<P>The faction were against the duke of York's going to Scotland; for
reasons, as an intelligencer informed, that determined the King for it.
Essex approved of it; and Halifax, though he at first objected, acqui∣esced.</P>

<P>The duke was to write from Brussels, on his arrival, to ask the King's

<P>On the twenty-fifth of September, the duke took leave of the King,
and went to Brussels and Holland; and came back to London, without
having troubled Essex or Halifax; the season of the year not being
proper for a voyage by sea. He waited in the Downs, till leave was
sent to come to London; the duchess being so ill as to vomit blood.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 13th.</NOTE> the duke came to London, by the
King's leave, in his way to Scotland. A week after he arrived in town,
Lord Sunderland and Mr. Hyde came to tell him, that the King thought
it for his service he should go to Scotland, as soon as he could; but did
not intend he should stay longer than January. The duke resolved to
obey; and set out on the twenty-seventh of October. Essex and Halifax
were, probably, the cause.</P>

So he set out about the end of the month; leaving the princesses
Anne and Isabella at St. James's. The King ordered Lauderdale to
send directions, for the duke's sitting in the privy council, without tak∣ing

that Lauderdale had served the King very well, and was his particular
friend, of which he had many testimonies in his absence; and, that it
would be a great discouragement to the King's servants, to see a person,
who had supported his authority with so much zeal, so ill requited for
it; and he could not give his consent. The ministers said, they only
proposed to lay him gently aside, to sweeten things before the parlia∣ment
met; which had a pique against him and would else fall upon
him, and, therefore, hoped the duke would be, at least, passive in it:
But he told them he would not promise; thinking it his duty to speak
his mind freely and sincerely to the King, on all such occasions. This
might, probably, give a helping hand to the resolution of sending him
back. The King, however, promised to recal him a few days after the
parliament should rise.</P>

<P>The duke of York, by his industry, application, affability, and kind

<HEAD>EXTRACT XVI.</HEAD>
<P>On the twenty-eighth of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28th.</NOTE> the duke of Monmouth arrived,
about eight o'clock at night, at Whitehall. He sent, by captain God∣frey,
a short letter to the King; hoping that he would not be offended
at his coming over, since it was with a design for his service; and, hav∣ing
some business of consequence to speak to him, desired his leave.
The King answered, in writing, that he was extremely surprized to hear
of his coming into England, after such positive commands not to do it.
He ordered him to be gone immediately, if he hoped ever to see his face
again; and to do it so privately and suddenly, that the world might
take no notice of his disobedience. Godfrey returned, with repeated in∣stances
for Monmouth's seeing the King and speaking a word; assuring
his Majesty, that he would do any thing he desired. The King said, he
would be obeyed; and stood firm. His coming was concerted with the
lords, now framing pretences for the parliament's sitting; and there was
reason to think, that Monmouth had been in town three or four days
before he sent to the King; it being known, that Godfrey had been
there so long. If the duke did not go, the King was resolved to send an
officer of the guards to see him on ship-board. This the King told
Godfrey, after being with him the second time. The King went to bed,
not doubting but Monmouth would obey, none as yet knowing of his
<PB N="99" REF="111"/>
coming. But, after twelve o'clock at night, Monmouth came to his
lodgings at Whitehall; and, before the morning, it was known all
over the town. Monmouth came to visit him, as soon as stirring. The
King rose; and fresh instances were made only to see him. Lord
Fauconberg, Macclesfield and his son came upon the errand. The
King refused, and ordered him immediately from Whitehall; and, by
night, out of England, on pain of losing all his places. He answered,
by lord Fauconberg, that he was gone out of Whitehall; but begged
he might be permitted to stay in England, in any place. He was then
at his house in Hedge-lane, where the cabal held a meeting. The King
still peremptorily ordered him to be gone; and, if he did not obey
by that night, he must never expect to see his face any more. The
King sent for all the principal officers of his troop immediately, and
ordered them not to obey Monmouth. He resolved to take away his
post of captain of the guards; and, for that purpose, ordered Sunder∣land
to make a commission for the duke of Albemarle to be captain,
and to send for him to town. The duchess of Monmouth begged the
King to see the duke. The King bid her tell him, that he wanted
nothing but an entire obedience in this matter; and that he would give
him no longer time, nor hear any more from him. The next morning,
she sent the King a letter, that her husband was not yet gone, and re∣newed
the request of admittance into his presence, as he had somewhat
to justify himself from the accusation. He sent her a verbal answer,
desiring her to remember what he had said the night before; and that
he would certainly be as good as his word.</P>
<P>Fauconberg came, in the afternoon, with a letter from Monmouth,
pretending he had long refused to bring it; but had yielded, at last, to
his importunities. The King would not receive the letter, nor send an
answer to it, but that he had nothing to say to him. The duke of
Albemarle was put, that evening, into the command of the guards,
Mulgrave made governor of Hull and lieutenant of the East Riding,
and the earl of Shrewsbury made lieutenant of Staffordshire. The com∣mission
of master of horse was likewise taken from Monmouth, though
not disposed of. Sir Thomas Armstrong was turned out of the guards,
and his commission given to Mr. Griffin. The thousand pounds that he
had paid were, however, refunded. A design was laid to prove the
<PB N="100" REF="112"/>
King's marriage with Monmouth's mother. They pretended that a letter
was taken from her, when she was put in the Tower, under the King's hand,
owning the marriage; and, to prove that the paper was then taken, they
produced a news-book, in 1652, calling her Charles Stewart's wife, and
saying, that the letter was to be a ground for it. Sir—Parry pre∣tends
to prove the marriage, by a bishop that is dead.</P>
<P>On the 30th of November, the duke of Monmouth had not left
London. The prince of Orange was no stranger to his proceedings.</P>
<P>On Sunday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec.</NOTE> the lords Huntingdon, Clare, Stamford, Shaftesbury,
North, Gray, Cherbury, and Howard of Escric, came to the King, with

<P>On the twenty-sixth of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1680. Jan.</NOTE> the parliament was prorogued to the
fifteenth of April. Monsieur d'Avaux solicits the Dutch to an alliance
with France. A further prorogation to November was urged, for that
purpose; so that the King of England could not assist the States, if at∣tacked.
Thus a prorogation might keep France from invading Hol∣land,
and Holland from a league with France. The King proposed to
recal the duke of York before the session. But he was dissuaded by his
ministers. The duke of York told the privy council, whom he had
chose, that he would acquaint the King, that he had, in Scotland, a
brave and loyal nobility and gentry; a regular and wise privy council;
and the judicatures <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed with learned and upright persons. That the
disaffected party was not so considerable as those in England represented
them; and, having reconciled peace to some of the Highland families,
they were now firm to the King's interest. He took leave of the privy
council; the chancellor answering how sensible they were of the honour
of his presence, the advantages of his conduct and advice; and that
they themselves were entirely devoted to the King, and to his royal
highness. Their letters to, the King. The duke and duchess embarked
at Leith; and they arrived at Privy-Stairs on the twenty-fourth of
February. An address from Norfolk thanking the King for recalling
<PB N="101" REF="113"/>
the duke of York. The faction alarmed at his return. Rumours of
plots. Alford and Shaftesbury told the privy council of an Irish plot;
Plunket's. Blackburn's contract of marriage of the King and Mrs.
Barlow. The King is resolved to search into the bottom of it; and
Sir Gilbert Gerrard, who was said to have seen it, was carried before the
privy council, and declared positively, that he had neither seen nor knew
any thing of it. In May following, the King being indisposed, with
two or three ague fits, the duke of Monmouth wrote to him to enquire
of his health; signing at bottom, “Your dutiful Monmouth.” He
inclosed it in one to Mr. Godolphin; who delivering it to the King, HE
bid Godolphin tell him, if he would make his actions answerable to
the conclusion of his letter, and obey his orders, it was the only way to
a reconciliation. But if he flattered himself with the support of the
factious party, or that parliament might interfere in his favour, he should
find it would make things worse. Accordingly, about a month after,
finding no change in Monmouth's conduct, he published a declaration,
protesting, on the word of a King and a faithful Christian, that he was
never married to Mrs. Barlow, alias Walters, the duke of Monmouth's

<P>In Norfolk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 24th.</NOTE> the grand jury, instead of presenting the petition to the
Justices of the session, presented the promoters thereof, for meddling
therewith; and, in Somerset, they not only remonstrated against the
petition, but issued warrants against the promoters thereof; one of whom
they indicted, for promising to petition against the proclamation, and
procuring a party's hand to be set to it, without his privity. The grand
jury found a bill; but the cause, by a <HI>certiorari,</HI> was removed to the
King's Bench. In Berks, the petition was presented by Sir J. Stonehouse,
Mr. Barker, Wood, &amp;c. most of them honest gentlemen; though prince
Rupert was lord lieutenant, and constable of Windsor Castle and Forest:
the only petition that came so formally to the King. The Yorkshire
petition was not presented in council as proposed. The King saw, that
nothing but time could do good to parliament.</P>

The King said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 28th.</NOTE> in council, “I think fit to acquaint you, that I have
sent for my brother; not having found such an effect from his absence,
as should incline me to continue it longer; since we have lately seen,
and may see again, questions started, of so high a nature in themselves,
and to him particularly of so great concern, as make it agreeable, both
to reason and justice, that he should be present at the next session of par∣liament.
For though it shall always be my care to preserve him in his
right, yet I think it may be for his satisfaction, as well as for his in∣terest,
to be upon the place, if any such debate should arise again;
and, in the mean time, I promise myself such a compliance from him
in all things, that shall be thought necessary for the general quiet and
security of my kingdom, that no body will have reason to be alarmed
at his return; or to apprehend, that his being near me will have any
ill influence upon the public.”</P>

Brandon, and nine commoners, Sir Edward Hungerford, Sir Gilbert
Gerrard, Sir Hugh Calverley, Sir Scroop How, Sir William Cooper,
Mr. Thynn, Trenchard, Wharton, and Dr. Otes, went to the grand jury
at Westminster, and delivered an information against the duke of York,
for being a popish recusant. Just as they came to the jury, they found
them going down to the King's Bench, with a petition for the parlia∣ment
sitting, which the foreman delivered to the lord chief justice, who
ordered it to be read; after which, the judges spent some time in con∣sulting
of an answer to it, and judge Jones demanded of them, whether
they had all their presentments ready. They replied, that a small time
would finish them; but then the court told them, that they had spent
their time in things that did not belong to them, and neglected things
they ought to have done; and, therefore, they were discharged, and their
petition would have been returned, but they would not receive it, saying,
they had done their duty; and so left it with the court. This discharg∣ing
of the jury makes a great noise, because they had not given in their
presentments; as doth the information against his royal highness; none

<P>On the twenty-second of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 22d.</NOTE> the King was at Newmarket; and,
the same day, the council met at Whitehall, on information, that a
great number of apprentices were enlisted by one Alford, under pre∣tence
of burning the rump. He was secured by the lord mayor, and
committed by the council, for high treason, as he deserved, for offering
to enlist men.</P>
<P>Sir William Waller and the fanatics endeavoured to make it be
thought a popish plot; and some were so malicious, as to write and
contrive, as Sir Samuel Bernardiston and others, that the guards were
to join with them to fire the city, and to cut the throats of the pro∣testants.
These were the very words of some of the letters, adding, that
the like design had been discovered in Ireland.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th.</NOTE> Shaftesbury called a council, and told them of
a new popish plot in Ireland, by primate Plunket and his clergy, to de∣liver
the kingdom to the French. He desired a private committee, for
imparting all he knew; the president, lord Bridgwatcr, Essex, secretary
Coventry, and Mr. Hyde, to form this committee, that the author might
not be named; and likewise powers to examine, without the knowledge
of the duke of Ormonde or the King. All was granted. But Mr.
Hyde told the chancellor, and complained against it in council.</P>

<P>On the twenty-sixth of June, Shaftesbury came to Westminster, and
made a speech to the grand jury, then sitting, about the danger of
popery; invectives against the duke of York, offering an indictment
against him for recusancy, and witnesses to prove his hearing mass; and
desired them to reflect how unsafe it was he should have the management
of the post office; that two thirds of his estate might be saved; and,
that they would declare the duchess of Portsmouth a common nuisance.</P>

<P>On the ninth of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> the duke of York had notice from Mr.
Hyde, that Sunderland and Mr. Godolphin were of opinion he should
retire abroad. Essex and Halifax were of the same opinion; but he
was more surprized at the former, who had obligations to him, and pro∣fessed
to be his friends. The duchess of Portsmouth, pretending to
resent his not giving her assurances, during the King's late illness, of his
friendship, in case of the King's death, though not decent for him to
do, and needless, because the King's illness was slight, and not at all
dangerous, was employed to draw the King to the resolution of sending
the duke away. She had gone from Windsor several times to London,
to make up matters with Shaftesbury and his party, by the canal of lord
Howard of Escric, and, having done it, promoted their measures. The
King signified to the duke of York, that his affairs required his absence;
and he advised him to go to Scotland, sending before him a letter, that he
had sent him to take care of the affairs of the realm; and some proposed
a pardon for him, before an impeachment, which Shaftesbury threat∣ened;
in which case it was undoubtedly valid. The King thought
that the commons would proceed by bill, and not by impeachment, as
<PB N="105" REF="117"/>
a shorter way, but was against a pardon; and, in any case, assured
him, that he would dissolve the parliament.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>EXTRACT VII.</HEAD>
<P>On the ninth of this month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 9th.</NOTE> the King came from Newmarket to Lon∣don.
The duke of York's removal abroad was discoursed more than
ever. Sunderland and Godolphin both assured him, that the King
thought of no such thing. Coming to London, Mr. Hyde told him, that
Sunderland was grown cold to him; and, though they often saw one
another, had never opened his mouth to him of any business, which
made him and the duke of York believe the reports were true. But
Hyde did not think his friend Godolphin of that mind. He was un∣deceived
the next day after the King came to town, when they told him
they thought the duke of York's absence for the King's service; and,
the next day, both said so to the duke. Essex was for his returning
to Flanders: Halifax only from court: the King in doubt whether he
should be able to stand by him. Essex and Shaftesbury are reconciled.
Halifax was an atheist, and had no bowels. The King consulted the
privy council, who were of opinion, that the duke should not go; yet
the King continued of the same mind.</P>
<P>Two days after, he desired their advice, whether he should break the
parliament, if the duke of York was impeached; but this was a question
not to be answered, so no resolution was taken in council about the duke
of York. On Sunday, the King proposed his going to Scotland; and
wrote, on Monday, to his council there, that he had ordered his brother
to repair thither, to look after the affairs of the realm. The duke,
accordingly, on Wednesday, took leave of the King and set out. The
King expected, that the parliament would move for the militia, or some
act to retrench his power, and would then dissolve it. The duchess of
Portsmouth complained of the duchess of York, as being kinder to the
dutchess of Mazarin than to her. After the duke's return from Scot∣land,
the cavaliers are disobliged at the directions given to the judges,
in favour of the non-conformists, and judge Ellis not being turned out.</P>

<P>On the twenty-first of October, being the day after the duke's de∣parture,
the parliament met. The bill of exclusion, and the debates
thereupon, by lord Russel, Sir Henry Capel, colonel Titus, and Har∣bord.
The expulsion of the members, for discouraging petitions,
though it frightened all, had purged the house, and paved the way for
the bill's passing. The bill was kept four or five days in the house of
commons, till the house of lords was prepared for it, by addresses from
the common council of London. Rumours of plots:—Dangerfield.</P>
<P>The same stratagem had been used in the house of commons when the
bill was first brought in there.</P>
<P>Dugdale, Francisco Perez, and Dangerfield were thought to lessen
the votes for the duke of York, by accusing his friends. This made
the lord privy seal vote for it.</P>
<P>As soon as Dangerfield had given his evidence, lord Russel carried the
bill to the lords. Many of the house of commons opposed it; but his
imperious temper hurried him on with it; and the members gave a
shout, when it was delivered. Sunderland voted for it. A proposal
was made for the King's divorce. The commons were vexed at the
bill's being rejected. Russel declared, if his father had been against it,
he would have voted him an enemy to the King and country; and, if
he could not live a protestant, he would die one. Mr. Leveson Gower
said, some, perhaps, might be for making peace with the duke of York,
“but,” says he, “I will perish first, and my opinion is, that we should
break up, and return each to his country, and let the, people see how
we are used; and I doubt not but they will soon join us, with their
swords in their hands; and then, we will let the duke know, that we
defy him and all his popish adherents.”</P>
<P>The parliament fell on the duke of York's friends. Sir E. Seymour,
for misapplying 600,000<HI>l.</HI> given for building thirty ships. Halifax,
lord chief justice Scrogs, and Sir E. Seymour warded the blow. Halifax
offered to withdraw, but the King would not suffer it. Scrogs was dis∣charged,
and recompensed with a pension, New accusations against the

duke of York about the plot. Mrs. Cellier's engagement with Lewis
to burn the ships at Chatham. The disputes about the pardon; which
and maintenance the house of commons, accordingly, addressed for,
and desired a pardon for perjury too, it not being safe for witnesses to
declare at first the whole truth, as sworn to say. The attorney general
had been complained of, for not drawing Dangerfield's pardon full enough.
Lewis had forgery in his pardon, to make him a legal witness.</P>

firm in opposing the bill of exclusion. He had procured the King's

as if the King consented to the bill; and a man sent, from the great men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exclusionists.</NOTE>
to the bishops, to prepare them for it, as for the King's service; and a
good correspondence between the two houses was acceptable to the King.
This made his public disapprobation necessary. The King resolved to
have the bill refused by the lords, at the first reading, and not returned,
in hopes of mending it at a committee, which had been mightily la∣boured
to get him to consent to. Agreed to limitations or some tem∣porary

pay his troops and seamen. Protest of the lords, respecting the bill of
exclusion. Halifax signalized himself in the debate for rejecting it.
Sunderland voted the other way, which displeased the king. The point
of religion moved them more than a spirit of faction. An artifice to per∣suade
many; but they were engaged too far to retreat, and their safety
consisted in getting it passed, as the duke of York would not forgive.
The commons adjourned next day. The lords cpnsidered how to se∣cure
the protestant religion. Divorce of the Queen proposed in the de∣bate.
Lord Peterborough was not committed by the lords, on Danger∣field's
evidence, which Essex did not believe. It was contrary to <HI>habeas
corpus</HI> to imprison lady Powis twice for the same crime. Dangerfield
withdrawn. Lord Russel brought up the bill of exclusion. When he
had read the title, there was a great shout at the bar. The debate about
Peterborough was kept on till three, that the bill of exclusion might
lie on the table. The duke of York's friends thought it of worse con∣sequence;
so debated from three to nine, and rejected it by thirty-three
votes. Halifax spoke incomparably, and bore the burden of the day
in the committee. He answered Shaftesbury and Essex, as oft as they
spoke. He spoke, at lead, sixteen times, letting slip no good occasion.
His reasons were so strong, that they convinced every body that was not
resolved not to hear. Yet he proposed, next day, a bill of banishment,
that the duke should not come near the King's person as long as he
lived. Shaftesbury and his party turned it into ridicule. The duke's
friends said nothing, and it fell. Shaftesbury said no expedient would
serve, but marrying the King to a protestant wife, and divorcing the
Queen. He was seconded by Salisbury, Escric, Essex; and opposed
by Bridgwater, Halifax, &amp;c. This also fell, though it was threatened,
afterwards, to be taken up. Resolved to prepare a bill of association,
as in the time of Edward Third, and the thirteenth of Elizabeth. The
duke of Monmouth made a speech against the duke of York, saying
nothing should have provoked him to it, but his concern for the King's

life, and because he was fully satisfied, that the duke designed to take
it away. Halifax reflected severely on this speech.</P>
<P>For rejecting the bill of exclusion, 49 lords and 14 bishops, 63; for

<P>In the house of commons, for an address to remove Halifax 219,

<P>Ziele, one of the witnesses against Mrs. Cellier, owned he knew her
not, nor had ever seen her, only Lewis told him she was the woman he
talked with, who had a hood over her face. The attorney general added,
that for fear of being blamed again, as in Dangerfield's case, for not
making a pardon full enough, he had asked Lewis whether he had been
guilty of any other crimes, besides those mentioned in the King's war∣rant
for his pardon, viz. treasons, misprisions, felonies, outlawries.
Lewis owned he had been convicted of forgery.</P>
<P>A bill of indictment had been found against Mrs. Cellier, by the
grand jury of Middlesex, but ought to have been, by that of Surrey,
the fact being done there. Shaftesbury represented Lewis as a gentleman
of good birth, and fit for any employment; whereas his top prefer∣ment
was footman to Sir J. Moreton. The King had resolved not to
pardon perjury. Sir E. Seymour's answer to the articles of impeachment

also: and it should have power to fill up all vacancies, or remove any
from employments; yet to be subject to disallowance or approbation of

in the other, during the interval of sessions.</P>
<P>This, as Mr. Algernon Sidney and his party thought, was a gentle
way of dropping the government into a commonwealth. Lord Stafford
tried and condemned. He played his game worst when he had the best
cards. He made little use of advantages given him by witnesses. The
duke of York was aimed at in all these proceedings. The faction durst
not venture the trying of lord Arundel, the evidence not being full to
him. Carlisle and Escric had voted Stafford, their kinsman, guilty;
yet moved to change his sentence to perpetual banishment. This being
rejected, they desired to see him; under pretence of carrying the bishop
of London and Dr. Burnet to him. They only wanted to get somewhat
out of him against the duke of York: but the lords would not allow
them to see him alone, without a recorder present: so their project was
disappointed.</P>

and his party owned frankly, that they would have all dissenters, who
subscribe the test, exempted from taking the oath of allegiance. This
occasioned a great debate. The bishops and lords opposed the bill. It
was carried, in a committee of the house of lords, that the oath of al∣legiance
should remain still on fanatics as on Roman catholics; so that
the faction did not care for the bill.</P>

Buckingham been made last Thursday, he would have been chosen com∣mon

and was for the bill of exclusion.</P>
<P>The King agrees to a treaty with France, so as to allow the duke of
York to bring it about; but he would not move for it himself. He cau∣tioned
the duke, not to consent to any article that might foreclose from
calling a parliament, if he thought sit; and to press that the first pay∣ment
might be more considerable, than the succeeding and last; and,
that the person sent by the duke might come streight to London, and
deliver his letters to Mr. Hyde, to be shown to the King. The duchess
of Portsmouth pretended friendship for the duke. But it came to no∣thing.
Mrs. Wall conferred with Mr. Hyde, with overtures for a
reconciliation; but Mr. Hyde, in the treasury, had shewn more regard
to the King's necessities, than his credit with that lady. There is no be∣nefit
from it.</P>
<P>On Otes's affidavit, that he had seen the duke of York at mass, and
receive the sacrament after the rites of the church of Rome, the grand
jury, after being discharged at Hicks's-hall, were sent for, by the justices
of the Old Bailey, and presented him for recusancy: Which allowed a pre∣tence
for the duke to appear after proclamation, as the duke of Norfolk
and others had done. But this was neither safe nor practicable: so was
removed, by <HI>certiorari,</HI> to the King's Bench, and, if necessary, by a <HI>noli
prosequi.</HI></P>
<P>The King, to prepare for the Oxford parliament, had some guards
with him; and quartered the best part of Oxford's regiment on the
road, to secure his return. He left a body to secure the city. In doubt
of colonel Russel, he would have had earl Thanet buy his regiment,
who agreed; but afterwards declined it, on pretence that the King went
not on for a reform at court, which disheartened honest men. The duke
of York would have recommended Mulgrave; but the King was pre∣possessed
against him: so nothing was done, only the chief command
left with earl Craven.</P>
<P>The King wrote to all the lords to be there. Great pains were taken
to prevent the parliament's meeting at Oxford.</P>
<P>Fitzharris's plot and malicious libel, to alienate the people's affections
from the King. He was encouraged to it by the French ambassadour.
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
Everard brought privately into his chamber. Fitzharris denied what he
was accused of; but, as Cornish told the King, he knew of a higher
plot, if he might be pardoned. The two secretaries were scnt to exa∣mine
him. He said, that Monticuculi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Envoy for Modena.</NOTE>, before he left England, had
offered him 10,000<HI>l.</HI> to kill the King. That he refused, and said it
might easily be done at madam Mazarin's, by poison; and, that the
duke of York was privy to the design; who effected, that an army was
to come from France and Flanders to support the duke of York; a great
many parliament-men to be boiled to death, to make a <HI>Sainte Ampoulle,</HI>
to anoint him and succeeding Kings of England, at their coronation;
and, that money had been expeditiously raised, by the dutchess of Mo∣dena,
to support the design.</P>
<P>The King, seeing the design of this incoherent stuff, and that the
parliament would ask a pardon, ordered a commission of Oyer and Ter∣miner,
to try Fitzharris for his libel, proved by three witnesses, Sir
William Waller, Everard, and Smith. The time before the parliament
met was only a warning; yet prosecution followed with all possible ex∣pedition.
This foolish story made the duke of York's pardon to be
waved, when the King sent for granting it. The lady Isabella died
at London.</P>

<P>The King declared in council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters to the duke of York.</NOTE> and ordered writs for a parliament,
at Oxford, on the twenty-first of March. The earl of Salisbury
spoke first; and said, that he was sorry for the resolution; but
since the King had forbid the lords to offer any advice in it, he looked
on himself as unfit to serve him at the board, and begged his attendance
might be dispensed with. The King answered, with all his heart; ready
to grant so reasonable a request. Essex, Fauconberg, and Sir Robert
Carr, spoke very much against the dissolution; the first calling it a des∣perate
and pernicious council, and of fatal consequences, if the King
removed from London. The lord privy seal would fain have spoke
against the dissolution; but, according to frequent custom, ended with
no opinion. None else said any thing.</P>

<P>This day, about noon, Essex, Salisbury, Shaftesbury, Clare, and six
more lords, presented the King a petition, signed by thirteen or fourteen
lords, for the sitting of the parliament at London. The former part of
it a Remonstrance. The King said, it was the opinion of so many pri∣vate
men, but he was of another; and, these were things they ought not
to meddle with. The duke of Monmouth and lord Bedford signed the
petition; but came not with it. Lord Townshend was desired to sign
it; but he refused, and hindered several from signing it.</P>
<P>It is expected, that Manchester, Suffolk, and Macclesfield, will be

lords; and, to their great surprize, appeared in his robes. The lords,
ignorant of it, had not theirs. He dissolved them, took coach immedi∣ately,
and went that night to Windsor. This struck them, like thunder,
with confusion and amazement. It gave the King great reputation. His
friends took courage. The faction were in the greatest rage and despair.
The King still would not let the duke of York return, till he saw how
matters went; and, till he had reformed the lieutenancy of the city, the
justices of the peace, and the militia throughout the kingdom.</P>

<P>The duke of Monmouth tried to get into favour; duchess of Ports∣mouth

the duke of York's friends opposed it, as improper, while he was in

<P>The duke of York desired, by Churchill, a parliament to be called

and the duke to be commissioner, it not being fit for any other person to

<P>Some Roman Catholics zealous to advance the Roman Catholic
religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 4th.</NOTE> but no plot. Otes, at his first examination, before the King
and council, said, that he had ventured his life, for his Majesty's ser∣vice,
at sea, and his foul at land. He owned, that he confessed and re∣ceived
once a week, at the jesuit's, to discover their designs; yet was no
Catholic in his heart, but to get favour with the jesuits. When, on his
accusing the lords Arundel and Bellasis, and Sir George Wakeman, as
knowing of the plot, the King said, that the two lords had served him
and his father so eminently, that, unless proofs were full, no credit was
to be given them; Otes answered, “God forbid he should accuse any
unjustly. He did not say they knew it, but were to be acquainted with
it, by the jesuits.” The King, afterwards, mentioned this publickly.</P>
<P>At his first examination, he said he had been at Madrid when the 5 or
10,000 l. were telling out before Don John, to be sent Sir George Wake∣man,
as a reward for promising to poison the King. The King asking
what sort of man Don John was, he said, <HI>a lean, tall, black man;</HI> yet
Don John was a little, fat, well complexioned man, though brown hair.
He said he had been at the jesuit's college, with father La Chaise, the King
of France's confessor; he knew not where, but said it was the house just
by the Louvre. Otes was so little credited, that Sir George Wakeman
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
was dismissed after the examination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> Otes told none of the essential
parts of the plot, at first. See Journals of the lords, for his perjury
about the queen; before whom he had sworn, that he had no other per∣son
of quality whatever to accuse. This was a forthnight before he ac∣cused
her. The lord chancellor asking him at council, if he had ever
seen Coleman, he said, no; yet, at his trial he told another story. It
was impossible that the jesuits should trust Otes, after turning him out
of their society for ignorance and debauchery.</P>
<P>Lord Bellasis, a brave officer, was infirm, troubled with the gout,
and unfit for employment: Petre was timorous, and no soldier: Sir
Francis Ratcli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, no man of the sword, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inical; and when Otes
swore he had given him his commission in Wild-garden, he had not been
in London for two years, but constantly at his house in Northumber∣land,
not having, in that time, lain a night out of it, as was known to
all in those parts, and as Daniel Collingwood testified in the house of
commons when he was first accused. Colonel Thomas Howard was
grown very infirm, and died of his indisposition, about the time named
by Otes, who swore he gave him a commission in Wild garden, when
Thomas Howard was at Bath; and, after he came to London, he never
stirred out, being so lame and infirm, that he could not walk up stairs,
but was carried in a chair, not able to stand or walk. He died a forth∣night
after he came from Bath. Sir William Goring, not of age,
and but lately come from abroad, was unfit to have many thousand
pounds pass through his hands. No meeting of jesuits at the White∣horse
Tavern, though once in three years they met to chuse a provin∣cial,
and other officers, secretary, procurator. All that died in pri∣son,
or were executed, denied it: No commission was produced or ap∣peared:
No arms in any Roman Catholic's house that was searched,
besides a fowling-piece and a case of pistols.</P>
<P>Bedloe, when he was first examined, before the secretaries Coventry
and Williamson, in the King's presence, declared he knew nothing of
any plot; but only of Godfrey's murder (see Journals of the lords
next day); yet turned witness for the plot. He made a foolish
story, of Spanish pilgrims to land at Milford; swore against White∣bread
and Fenwick, though, when brought to the bar and examined, he
denied, when asked upon oath, if he had any thing to say against them;
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>
yet they were condemned and hanged on his evidence, which agreed with
Otes's. He swore, that Godfrey's body lay upon the stairs at Somerset∣house,
in a common passage for pages and footmen, between eight and
eleven at night.</P>
<P>Praunce, after accusing the four, afterwards hanged for Godfrey's
murder, being sent for to the council to be examined, desired captain
Richardson to carry him first to the King, having somewhat of conse∣quence
to tell. He was, accordingly, carried to Chiffinch's chambers,
where the King came. Praunce fell at his feet, trembling and shaking,
which the King seeing, he called in Richardson and Chiffinch. Then
Praunce confessed, that he was perjured, and not a word of truth in all
that he had deposed; that he had no rest till he told this to the King; and,
being brought to the council, he made the same confession. But, when he
got back to prison, he unsaid it again; and swore to it, at the trial of the
three persons he had accused, and who were condemned. The fourth,
Bury, a protestant, was reprieved. He told Dr. Loyd, he would not
tell a le to save his life, and, that all Praunce had sworn was false.
When he would not confess the fact, he was, after fifteen days, hanged.
He died a protestant. Godfrey was not seen by any body, after one,
the day he was missing. Bedlow saw the body lying on the Queen's
back stairs, which looks into one of the courts. Praunce says, in a
room, which looked into the garden; and they differ in the manner of
the murder. Bedlow's perjury against Atkins, Mr. Pepys's clerk.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange comes for England; but returned dissatisfied.
The faction, failing in this scheme, began to wheedle with the King;
promising, if he would call a parliament, to give a supply, without in∣sisting
on the bills of exclusion or limitation. This was the prince of
Orange's proposal. The lord chancellor and others favoured it.</P>
<P>The parliament meets in Scotland. Questions about burroughs. The
first trial of skill in it was carried for the King. The faction are much
cast down. The duke of York's friends sollicit his return. Halifax op∣posed

employed in two companies doing nothing. To be given to Huntly,
Argyle, Athol, and Seaforth, seven hundred pounds each, to answer

The King approved of it. Lauderdale offended at the duke of York's
exceptions to the lord register, the earl of Argyle, and the president of
the session. He laboured to persuade the King, that they were all dis∣posed
to his service.</P>
<P>The Scotch parliament had framed a new test, which was refused by
the dukes of Monmouth and Hamilton, when ministers at Edinburgh.
Argyle was prosecuted, for refusing it, or explaining it, as a privy coun∣cillor,
and as commissioner of the treasury. When sworn as commissioner,
he gave in his explanation. He was found guilty of treason, leasing-making,
&amp;c. He escaped out of prison; and the only design being not
to take away his life, but to get a forfeiture of some jurisdictions and supe∣riorities
surreptitiously acquired by his predecessors, and most tyrannically
exercised, so the examination stopped. He escaped out of prison, by
means of his daughter's changing cloaths with her footman, and carrying
up her train. He passed undiscovered by the guards, and got out of the
realm. Sentence then pronounced.</P>

The duke and duchess of Lauderdale intreated for lord Lorn, who
had leave to come up and to plead for himself. He was restored in
estate. Shaftesbury acquitted.—Quo warranto.—</P>
<P>The prince of Orange tries again to get the King to close with par∣liament,
and desert the duke of York. The King's necessities forced
him to a private treaty with France. Fifty thousand pounds a quarter
were the terms; and the first payment to be at the end of June 1681;
without any condition on the King's part, but that of friendship; and
with promises on the French part, not to disturb Flanders or Holland.
But France thinking it no breach to take Strasburg and Cassel, and block
up Luxembourg, the Dutch clamoured; and the King promised to call
a parliament, if France proceeded <HI>par voy defait.</HI> So the King was
forced to send a memorial to the French King, that, unless he suf∣fered
provisions to be brought into Luxembourg, he must call a parlia∣ment.
Halifax is for the duke of York's being sent for. Fifty wag∣gons
let in. The parliament to convene at Cambridge. France offered
to quit all pretences, if Luxembourg is delivered. This was sufficient
to ground a treaty. All the Dutch vehement solicitations, for a parlia∣ment,
came from the prince of Orange. The duke of York comes
to court, by the duchess of Portsmouth's means. G. Jefferies, the duchess
of Portsmouth's council, assured, that the five thousand pounds a year
being surrendered to him, he might surrender it again to the duchess of
Portsmouth. This might be done, by levying a fine on so much of the
profits of the Post-office as was necessary for that end. The duke of

he should propose somewhat for a better agreement. He replied,

pressed extremely to propose somewhat, he desired time to think of it.
The King had called several parliaments, partly to assist his foreign

allies; and, instead of aiding him, the very treaties he had made with
them, were urged as suspicions for the support of popery in England:
And the parliament, so far from giving a penny to assist him, that they
would not give a farthing to preserve Tangier. The King desired the
prince of Orange to propose somewhat to remove jealousies. England
had then a greater aversion to the prince of Orange, than to the duke
of York.</P>

angry, and said, he had promised and would go. Seymour posted upon
this to Windsor. The King wrote to the prince to come immediately
thither. He durst not refuse to comply with his commands. He
pressed hard for the preservation of Flanders. He undertook the States
should do whatever the King did; but HE must make the first step.

<P>The King judged it unfit to call a parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> But if the French
King absolutely invaded Flanders and broke the peace, he would call
one; though in that case, he did not expect that they would do any thing
for preserving Flanders, without having their will at home; and, even in
that case, he would part with them again. The King was desired to name
commissioners, to speak with the Spanish ambassador, in presence of that
<PB N="127" REF="139"/>
of the Dutch, to see what they would go on, before the prince of Orange
went away. This the King agreed to; and appointed Halifax, Con∣way
the secretary, and Hyde. The substance or the conference was,
that the Spanish ambassadour desired the King to send the States word
what he was in a condition to do, if France proceeded farther <HI>par voye
de fait.</HI> Answer, this would put the King on making a step by
himself, if the States should not be so forward as the King proposed to
be. Secondly, asked, that the King and States might appoint their
ministers at Paris to present memorials, that the King of France would
remit all further pretensions, to be decided at the conference at Court∣ray;
and, mean while, not to put himself in possession of any place,
either by decree of the chamber of Metz, or by force. And if he de∣nied
this, thirdly, that the King and States should declare they must
take other measures for preserving the Low Countries. And, fourthly,
the Spanish ambassadour desired that the King would send over two thou∣sand
foot, of his own men, to Flanders, by way of loan, till they could
perfect the levies they were about.</P>
<P>To the first, was answered, that what memorial soever the States
would order their ambassador to deliver at Paris, the King's should have
orders to second it, though he had not had the same experience. The
States would not order theirs to use the phrase of taking measures; but
let it be what it would, as the King had hitherto used jointly with the
States, he would continue to do so, and make no separate steps. As to the
fourth proposition, the King had no obligation to send any men, till war
was declared; that the number was too inconsiderable for the preservation
of Flanders, but too many for him to spare from his service. This was
reported to the King, in presence of the prince of Orange. The King
agreed to it; and the prince of Orange was fain to acquiesee, though
not satisfied. The prince's coming was certainly contrived by the Spa∣nish
ambassadour and our own people, to try, if possible, either by the
consideration of foreign or of domestic affairs, to oblige the King to
call a parliament speedily; in which all the points, art and industry ima∣ginable
have been used, but the King has resisted them all. Yet if
France continue to proceed as she has done, it will be unsupportable;
and a parliament will be called, as the French ambassador has been
<PB N="128" REF="140"/>
told. The faction pretended now to be afraid of France; and would
not aim at the bill of exclusion.</P>
<P>Since the prince of Orange's going a project on foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Seymour's letter.</NOTE> by the South∣ampton
club,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13th.</NOTE> of having the parliament presently called, in which they
undertake for a supply for preserving Flanders, and not to insist on
exclusion, or question any ministers, was the very dregs of the prince's

<P>The news of Strasbourg surprized them, and had an ill effect on

duke of York's estate, and his coming into England. The duke of
Monmouth had refused the test. The duchess of Portsmouth would do
the duke of York all the service she could. The King of Sweden had
come into the prince of Orange's league. On Hales's excusing himself,
Mr. Chudleigh was chose for Holland. When a parliament is called to
preserve Luxemburgh, the Dutch will not concern themselves, whether
it is preserved or no; so that we shall only discompose our own affairs,
disoblige the King of France, and do Spain no good. Yet the King,

<P>Lord Hyde came to Edinburgh on the thirty-first of August,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2d.</NOTE>
1680; and brought an answer to the message sent by Churchill, for
leave to wait on the King. The answer was, that, except the duke of
York resolved to conform entirely, and go to church, no leave was to
be had; that, if he did not conform, the King could no longer support
him, though he had hitherto done it; “that I should ruin myself and
him.” Hyde executed his instructions well, in pressing and representing
the dismal state of affairs; when, after two or three days discourse, he
<PB N="130" REF="142"/>
saw he could not prevail, he shewed the duke a short note, in the King's

I should have leave to come to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extracts from letters from the King to the duke of York.</NOTE> as soon as the parliament was up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Had his royal highness's ghostly fathers been more indulgent, he himself would not probably have been so averse from this proposal. But they had forced him to a rigid ad∣herence to the rules of the church, in articles for which others have frequently obtained dispensations. This appears from his own account of his conversion, which he relates as follows. The extract was made from his own memoirs, and in his own very words, by father Sanders, his confessor. It is to be found, as in the margin, in Nairne's hand.</P>
<P>“It was about the beginning of the year 1669,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. II. fol. No. 5.</NOTE> that (having long had in my thoughts that the church of Rome was the only true church) I was more sensibly touched in con∣science, and began to think seriously of my salvation. Accordingly, I sent for one father Joseph Symonds, a Jesuite, who had the reputation of a very learned man, to discourse with him upon that subject; and when he came, I told him the good intentions I had of being a catholic, and treated with him about my being reconciled to the church. After much discourse about the matter, the father very sincerely told me, that, unless I would quit the communion of the protestant church of England, I could not be received into the catholic church. I answered, that I thought it might be done, by a dispensation from the pope; alledging to him the singularity of my case, and the advantage it might bring to the catholic religion in general, and in particular to those of it in England, if I might have such a dispensation for outwardly appearing a protestant, at least, till I could own myself publicly to be a catholic, with more security to my own person and advantage to them. But the good father insisted, that even the pope himself had not the power to grant it; for it was an unalterable doctrine of the church, not to do ill that good might follow. What this good Jesuit thus said, was, afterwards, confirmed to me by the pope himself, to whom I writ upon the same subject. Till this time, I be∣lieved (as it is commonly believed, or, at least, said, by the protestant church of Eng∣land doctors) that dispensations, in any such cases, are by the pope easily granted: but father Symond's words, and the letters of his holiness, made me think it high time to use all the endeavours I could to be at liberty to declare myself, and not to live in so unsafe and so uneasy a condition.”</P></NOTE>.”</P>

which he and his predecessors had surreptitiously obtained,
and most tyrannically exercised. The King respited his sentence. He
was glad to get those superiorities and offices, which he thought too great
for any one subject, out of such bad hands. He escaped by means of
his daughter. Some of the council advised, that she should be publickly
whipt through the streets of Edinburgh. The duke prevented it; and
said, smiling, “That they were not used to deal so cruelly with ladies
in his country.” But notwithstanding the duke designed no real harm to
Argyle, his enemies were too watchful to let slip any opportunity of
decrying his conduct. The duke and duchess of Lauderdale had a great
share in these false reports. They interceded veh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mently in favour of
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>
Argyle's son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE> the lord Lorne. This the duke was no less ready to con∣cur
in, than the King to grant; only desired, that in settling the
estate, due regard should be had, and provision made, for the younger
children. But the duchess of Lauderdale pressed hard for having all
the offices, except justiciary, confirmed to Lorne. The duke urged
for a signature and disposition of the estate, for the payment of all
just creditors, with moderate donatives to such as Argyle had ruined by
his tyranny, the surplusage being intended to descend to his family.
The King refused to see Lorne, but with the duke's consent.</P>
<P>The King's necessities had been long so great, and the parliament so
refractory, that he had no way left for relief, but by a private agreement
for a pension from France. The conduct of the French upon this, had
like to have obliged the King to call a parliament; which, at that time,
would have turned to the duke's advantage. The project was broke
off by Halifax's resined arguing, who was always for cleaving a hair in
his advice. The duke owed his return to court to the duchess of Ports∣mouth,
without her intending it. This turned out well for the King;
for, without the duke's presence, the King could not have obtained
such a victory over the faction.</P>

<P>The duke of York still in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts.</NOTE> at the beginning of this year;

see his being displeased with her management, with those of the rebel
party who were for the bill of exclusion; and nothing saved her from
more marks of displeasure, but the King's having owned her son so
publickly. So that he doubts, whether her journey to Bourbon was for
health, or by order; but she managed affairs so well, as to prevail
with the King to propose to the duke of York, to consent to settle on her
a rent-charge of five thousand a year, for which he would give an equi∣valent
out of some fund of the hereditary revenue. The duke answered,
he was ready to comply, and sign any paper the attorney general should
think necessary; but thought it could not well be done, without his being
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
at London, in presence of the judges, to make it valid, as was generally
believed. The duke's answer was calculated to make his return necessary to
dispatch the affair, which was much desired by the duchess of Portsmouth,
who was greedy to have it in her power to raise a hundred thousand
pounds, as soon as the grant should be passed; without which desire of
hers, it was not likely, from her former behaviour to the duke, that she
should press his return.</P>
<P>This made the duke of York keep the affair to himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb.</NOTE> which, by
providence, none knew or had observed, but himself; which was, that
it was not in his or any body's power to do what was desired, but an act
of parliament. So little did those who put her on asking it, or even
the King's learned council, know or remember the purport of the act.
The duke kept it secret from his trustiest friends, to get her credit and
interest to facilitate his return from an honourable banishment; she had
promised, as well as Halifax and Mr. Seymour, who were still against
his return. By her influence the duke returned, embarking at Leith in
a yaucht. He came to Yarmouth and Newmarket in the beginning of
March. Halifax and Seymour pressed his speedy return to Scotland,
desiring the affair might be settled there; but could not prevail. Hyde
solicited his stay, on the pretence already mentioned.</P>
<P>The King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> to satisfy his brother and the duchess of Portsmouth, gave
him pretences enough for going with him to London; and, at his return
thither, ordered the attorney general to prepare a deed, to be signed by
the duke, to do that affair of the post office. But, after a day or two,
the attorney general, perusing the act, found that nothing, but an act
of parliament, could impower the duke to do it. So the King and
duchess of Portsmouth were disappointed. She was then in France, and
forced to be satisfied with the reason of its not being done, as she could
not blame the duke. She still wanted to raise a hundred thousand pounds
some other way. In August she returned, and was in as great credit
as ever; and, though she lived seeming well with the duke of York,
began to use it to restore Sunderland to favour, and support the party.
Sunderland was made secretary of state again, in the room of Conway;
and, missing five thousand a year out of the post office, she got ten
thousand a quarter paid out of the privy fund, which she had no notice of
till then; and was kept a secret from all the world but the duke of York;
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
by whose means it was first had and negociated by Churchill, and then
paid to the first commissioner of the treasury. Had the duchess known
it sooner, she would have got her payments sooner; for the last quarter's
payment was not made when the King died. This secret, and the credit
the duke had with the King, made her jealous of him. What increased
her fears was, that the King had frequent conferences with the duke
about religion, which she fancied to be about politics. This set her so
against the duke, that, Sunderland being recalled, she endeavoured
to send the duke of York back to Scotland; had not the King been car∣ried
off by an apoplexy.</P>

<P>Either just before the meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4th.</NOTE> or during the sitting of one of the last
parliaments, a considerable sum was wanted to pay off several ships
newly come home; and the commissioners of the treasury were put
to it, to find ready cash. Several ways were tried, in vain; but, the
commissioners of hearth money, encouraged by a good bargain of the
overplus of that tax, for four thousand pounds a year, after the best
enquiry of the commissioners of the treasury, advanced it. For the de∣murrage
of the ships to be paid off would have been very chargeable;
and it was so much good husbandry and credit to the government. Be∣sides,
no body offered more, nor so much, as those that had it. The
<PB N="138" REF="150"/>
bargain was concluded a year sooner. One Shales, who had to do with
the affair of chimney money, came and brought a project to some of the
courtiers, that, if they could get the bargain of overplus, and he and
his friends have the collecting of it, they would give the King twenty
thousand pounds more than he was to have; and as much to the party,
as he should get it from. This being brought to the King, he sent it
to the treasurer, who examined it, and judged it impracticable. Shales,
angry with the treasurer, and lord Rochester in particular, applied again
to the King, who would have sent him to Rochester, but desired it
might be to Halifax, who embraced the proposal warmly; representing
it, as bringing in twenty thousand pounds to the King; and that, if the
King did not prosecute the managers of the hearth money, any body else
might. This being said to the King, he, at Halifax's instance, ordered the
lord keeper to enquire into the grant made to the managers of the over∣plus,
whether good in law. The lord keeper, after hearing Shales, and,
with the attorney and solicitor-generals, examined the affair, reported
their opinion, that the grant was legal, and not to be broken; that the
King could recover nothing of the managers, nor could any body else:
So Halifax desired that the affair might be dropped; and no further
enquiry was made into their books, to see what they had got by the
bargain.</P>
<P>When Otes and Doctor Tong came first to discover the plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 1st.</NOTE> before
they had appeared in public, or any body, but the King and Danby, had
heard of it, or they had been with Sir Edmund Bury Godsrey, being
pressed by Danby to let him see some of the jesuits letters, Otes pre∣tending,
he was so much trusted by them, that he often saw some of their
letters, and that they passed through his hands; he promised, but did
not perform in some weeks. He was still pressed, at last, to tell how
they were directed, that they might be intercepted in the Post-office; but
even this he could not do. After many puttings off, in the end of Au∣gust
or beginning of September, he wrote to Danby, whom he thought
at Windsor, to tell him, if he sent to the Post-house there, he would
find letters directed to Mr. Bedingfield, that would make out what he
said of the plot and design to murder the King. Danby was gone to
lord Norris's in Oxfordshire; so that a packet of letters, so directed,
were delivered to Bedingfield's man, who was sent for letters to the
<PB N="139" REF="151"/>
Post-office. <HI>For Mr. Bedingfield, to be left at the Post-house at Windsor, till
called for.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as Bedingfield received it, he carried the letters to the
duke of York, against whom, and the Roman Catholics in general, he
judged there was some design; the letters being counterfeited, by the
names of “Whitebread, Fenwick, Ireland, Blundel,” whom he
knew; but was sure it was none of their hands, which he knew
very well. As to Fogarty's, he could say nothing, having never seen his
writing; but believed it to be counterfeited, as the rest. Fenwick's
name was wrong spelt. The letters were all in one packet, four
singers broad, and five inches long; and all to the same purpose, giv∣ing
an account, in plain English, that they had received letters from
Peter Talbot, archbishop of Dublin, that all things were ready, in Ireland
and Scotland; and, that they would rise in arms, as soon as they heard
<HI>Forty-eight</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Being the number of years the King was old.</NOTE> (by this they meant the King) was dispatched; and all
ended, with desiring him to remember them to Mr. Colman. Beding∣field
desired the duke to deliver them to the King, or one of the secre∣taries;
and tell how he came by them, and his belief of their being coun∣terfeited,
and designed to do him prejudice; and, that he himself knew
of no such design. The duke did so; and desired secretary Coventry
might have them. The first letter the King opened and read was that
signed Blundel; and he said, that he was of the duke and Bedingfield's
mind, there was villainy. The hand he believed to be counterfeited;
and said, that he had seen one very like it; and would keep the letters
to compare with some he had seen.</P>
<P>The duke of York pressed Danby that the letters might be read at the
committee for foreign affairs; but could not get it done, till just before
the King went to Newmarket, when they were read there. Otes's first
narrative was also read, in Tong's hand-writing; and the letter, with
Blundel's name, compared with the narrative, and judged to be in the
same hand; and that the whole affair was a mere invention. The whole
committee was then present, the duke of York, prince Rupert, Chan∣cellor,
treasurer, Lauderdale, Arlington, Coventry, and Williamson.
When the jesuits were seized, their papers were compared with these
letters, and found not at all alike; and when, after all were delivered to
<PB N="140" REF="152"/>
Sir W. Jones, attorney-general, and Sir Robert Southwell, clerk of the
council, they compared some of Otes's writing with these letters, they
verily believed one of them was of his hand-writing. They were pro∣duced
at none of the trials of those whose names were put to them.
The letters sent by post were so ill worded, that none, but such an illi∣terate
dunce as Otes, would have wrote them, or his instructor Tong,
who made all for Otes; as his Majesty was told by one, who was at sup∣per
with these two villains, that, being warmed with wine, as usual every
night, they fell out, and called one another by their true names. Tong
said to Otes, “You rascal, was it not I that made the plot for you,
which you had not invention enough to do; and could never have made
any thing of it but for me?” The person, who told the King, desired
him to ask another about it; who, when the King asked him, confirmed
the truth of it.</P>
<P>The duke of Monmouth owned to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8th.</NOTE> in presence of the duke
of York, at secretary Jenkins's, that he knew of the whole conspi∣racy
except the designed assassination; and all the persons, who were
concerned in it with him; and did not contradict any thing lord
Howard said, but in one point not very material. He owned what
colonel Rumsey had said, as to lord Russel's saying, when Trenchard
had failed them, that he would immediately put on his boots, go
down into the west, to Taunton, and make them rise himself. He won∣dered
no more witnesses came in against Wildman, since no man was
more active in the conspiracy. He said, that the council of six gave
fifteen pounds a man, to send down Aaron Smith to Scotland; that Sir
William Courtnay, Sir—Drake, and other gentlemen, knew of it, in
the West; that Mr. Booth was the person they depended on in Cheshire,
and Sir J. Hotham in Yorkshire. He owned his visiting the guards,
in order to the surprize; that Doctor Owen, Mr. Mead, and all the chief
of the north country ministers, were privy to and active in the conspiracy;
that major Hurst, of Chichester, said, that it was easy to surprize Ports∣mouth;
and that he was ready to undertake it; for the officers on the
guard were, for the most part, drunk every night. The duke of Mon∣mouth
being asked by the King, whether they had any correspondence
with any in the guards or court, he positively denied it. As for Scot∣land,
that Sir J. Cochrane and Monroe's coming up hither about the
<PB N="141" REF="153"/>
Carolina business was but a pretence; it being really to adjust matters,
as to the rising there, at the same time that it was to begin here: That
Cesnock, Rouallen, Bailey, and the other Scots so told, were all en∣gaged
in it; that they complained they only wanted arms, but not
good-will; that Argyle could bring many men to help the western men;
that they had laid a design to surprize Stirling castle, by an old gutter,
or sally port, towards Balanguith, where there were no centinels; that
they were to seize the chancellor and treasurer, in Edinburgh, which
they thought they could do with forty or fifty horse, which they could
easily get into the town, without notice being taken.</P>

affair; but this last got off, when examined, by the committee of the
house of commons. He was busy, and the King, soon after, ordered
him out of the duchess of York's service. Upon advice from E. God∣frey,
in the beginning of September, that he was mentioned in Otes's
deposition, the duke of York bade him beware of his papers and per∣son;
yet he let his papers be seized; “Sure there was nothing to hurt
him;” and surrendered himself to secretary Williamson.</P>

<P>Some time after the duke of Monmouth was forbid the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1684. Jan.</NOTE> he
went privately beyond sea; only one gentleman and a servant along
with him. He embarked at Greenwich, in a fisher-boat, and landed
at Tervere, thence to Bergen-op-zoom, Antwerp, and Brussels. He spoke
with Fonsica, if not M. de Grana. He said he would go to Holland;
and he could say that to the prince of Orange, in a quarter of an hour,
that would satisfy him.</P>
<P>After the duke of Yorke had been at York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb.</NOTE> in the first Dutch war,
he moved the King to make Sir George Saville a viscount; and he pressed
it earnestly, and it was done some time after: Yet, when he came into the
house of lords, he always ran along with the popular party; and joined
in opposing the King's concerns. When Otes's plot was first brought on
the stage, none was so violent a driver of it as he; being one of the se∣cret

of his sins, the bishops read absolution to him. The duke of York pro∣posed
sending for a priest to him to count Castelmellor; but none being
found, Hudleston was brought up the back stairs to the private closet,
where the duke, the earl of Bath, and Trevanion, a captain of the guards,
were. Hudleston gave him the extreme unction and sacrament. The

<P>The King was seized with an apoplexy, about eight in the morning;
being dressed and just come out of his closet, where he had been some

time after he got out of bed. The duke of York was immediately ad∣vertised
of it; but before he could get to him, doctor King, a physician,
being in the drawing-room, had been called in, and let him blood. This
done, the moment after he fell; and, by the help of other remedies, pre∣scribed
by his own physicians, he came to himself and so perfectly to his

St. James's: But Hooke said they were for open war, and it would
be base to do it; and, if they would not promise him to desist from the
attempt, he would discover them all. If Monmouth had not been
beaten, they had risen, and had men ready for it; Danvers, Manley,
Payton, and this Hooke, with others, were to have headed them.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange considered the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpherson's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtracts.</NOTE> who was the present pos∣sessor,
and the duke of Monmouth, the pretender to the crown, as
equally obstacles to his aims. He, therefore, had been formerly ad∣vised,
by the pensionary Fagel, that his business was to play the one
against the other; and that whoever got the better would equally
advantage his pretensions. If the D. of Monmouth succeeded, it would
be easy for him, that was a protestant as well as he, and, in the right
of his wife, the next heir, to shove him out of the saddle. If on the
contrary the duke of Monmouth was worsted, he got rid of a dangerous
<PB N="144" REF="156"/>
rival; and was sure all his party would then have recourse to him;
which proved afterwards true. This made him, underhand, do all he
could to inflame this young man's fury and ambition; and send him out,
like a victim to the slaughter; playing a sure game himself, to whom∣soever
fortune should give the advantage at present.</P>
<P>The King had been long informed, even in the life of the late King,
by one Monpouleam, a companion at their drinking bouts, of the strict
correspondence and friendship betwixt the prince of Orange and Mon∣mouth.
Upon which the late King said, it seemed strange to him how
those two should appear so good friends and agree so well together, as
they aimed both at the same thing.</P>
<P>There were so many persons, in the mean time, ready to second the
duke of Monmouth's request, and among the rest the Q. dowager,
that the King, contrary to his judgment, consented to see him, which
he should not have done, unless he had been disposed to pardon. He
was willing to hear more of the matter, related by Mr. Sheldon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had sent Sheldon to meet the duke, on his way to London. Monmouth con∣fessed every thing to Sheldon. He discovered the intrigues of the prince of Orange and his own abettors in England. But Sunderland, it seems, afterwards induced him to deny the whole when he was brought before the King; assuring him, that he was certain of his pardon, and therefore ought not to betray friends, that might be useful to him, on a future occasion.</NOTE>. It was
strange my lord Sunderland did not oppose it; unless, as was said after∣wards,
he underhand assured the duke of Monmouth of his pardon, if
he confessed nothing; and then, when he had destroyed his own credit,
by contradicting himself, he took care to have him dispatched as soon as
possible afterwards. If Monmouth's head and heart had been answer∣able
to his mien and personal outside, he had certainly great opportu∣nities
of pursuing his aims, by the turbulency of the times, whom my
lord Shaftesbury, by his great dexterity, had so much inflamed against
the duke of York.</P>
<P>The punishment of Monmouth's followers raised discontents. A com∣mission
of Oyer and Terminer was issued to the lord chief justice Jef∣feryes,
to go down into the West, and inflict such punishments as the
example of former reigns and the security of the present seemed to re∣quire.
But imprudent zeal, or, as some said, avarice, carried him be∣yond
the terms of moderation and mercy; and he drew great obloquy
<PB N="145" REF="157"/>
upon the King's clemency, not only in the number, but in the manner
too of several executions; and in shewing mercy to so few, particularly
to an old gentlewoman, one Mrs. Alice Lisle, who was condemned and
executed, only for harbouring one Hick and Nelstrop, both ill men
enough indeed, and the latter in a proclamation. But, as she pre∣tended,
was ignorant of it, and therefore, perhaps, might suffer for a
common act of hospitality. But this severity was contrary to the King's
intentions; as appears from the different treatment one major Holmes
met with from the King and the chief justice. Holmes had lost his son
and an arm in the battle. He was brought up prisoner to town. The
King being desirous to see him, he behaved himself in such a manner,
as gained esteem from every body. His carriage was free from dejec∣tion,
but full of respect. He had recourse to the King's mercy; and
said, the favour he had asked was more beneficial to the King than to
him, considering his losses and his years. The King, who loved cou∣rage
even in an enemy, could not refrain from countenancing him. He
discoursed freely with him, and no one was more frequently in the anti∣chamber,
till it was thought fit to send him down to the west to inform
Jefferyes of those who most deserved mercy. He was hanged with the
rest.</P>
<P>The King questioned the chief justice, but he palliated his severities,
with the pretence of necessary justice; which the King knew not how to
contradict, since he had the precaution, not only to send four other
judges, as his assistants, along with him, but Mr. Pollexfen likewise, in
quality of his solicitor; who, being a known favourer of the Presbyte∣rian
party, he hoped would moderate the chief justice's heat. This
made the King acquiesce in what had been done, though it was of great
disservice to him at bottom. The cruelties of Kirk were still more in∣excusable
than the severities of Jefferyes. He caused many to be hanged
(vol. iv. p. 97.) more out of a bloody disposition, and to satisfy his own
brutal passions, than love of justice or his matter's service. It is not
improbable, but even then he had it in his view to draw an odium on
the King.</P>
<P>On the eleventh of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts. June.</NOTE> Monmouth landed, with a hundred and fifty
persons, at Lime in Dorset. Besides the information of Sheldon and the
prince of Orange, the King had been informed of it by one Monpouleam,
<PB N="146" REF="158"/>
a bottle-companion of Monmouth's; who also informed him of the strict
correspondence between the prince of Orange and Monmouth, when he
was first in Holland. When Monmouth was taken, he wrote, on the road,
to desire a mission into the King's presence; having somewhat to say, that
would give him a happy reign. Ralph Sheldon was sent to meet him;
and being asked who had the chief confidence with the King, he said
Sunderiand. Monmouth then, knocking his breast in a surprize, said,
<HI>“Why then, as I hope for salvation, he promised to meet me”</HI> He de∣sired
Sheldon to acquaint the King with it; and that he would inform
him of all his accomplices, seeing some of them had the King's confi∣dence.
Sheldon, on his return, was giving the King an account, when
Sunderland, pretending business, came into the closet; and Sheldon
stopt, desiring to speak to the King in private. But the King told
him he might say any thing before that lord, which put Sheldon to great
perplexity; yet he told what Monmouth said. Sunderland seemed at
first struck; but, after a short time, said, with a laugh, if that be all
he can discover to save his life, it will do him little good. Monmouth,
after he was brought to the King, begged for mercy; but made no great
matter of discovery. He would not see his duchess, his wife in law,
nor in the sight of God.</P>
<P>Proclamation against colonel Danvers, J. Trenchard, George Speke,
Francis Charlton, and J. Wildman. The lords Stamford, Delamere, and
Brandon seized, and put in the Tower, Jefferies sent to the West. Major
Holmes sent to inform Jefferies of the most criminal, and of such as de∣served
mercy, was hanged with the rest. Kirk, with his troops, made strange
havock. Lord Brandon Gerard was tried and found guilty, on the twenty∣sixth
of November, but was afterwards pardoned. Hampden pleaded
guilty. Delamere was acquitted, and Seaton found guilty of perjury. Stam∣ford
was not tried, but pardoned. Dangerfield was tried, on the twenty∣eighth
of June, and found guilty of perjury. Having been whipped to
Tyburn, as he was returning in a coach, one Mr. Francis asking him,
in derision, how his back did, Dangerfield making an abusive reply,
and Francis thrusting in his cane, unfortunately hurted his eye; of
which he died in some days. Francis was tried and condemned; and,
though he deserved well of the King, could obtain no pardon. Hook
was sent from Bridgwater to London, for the insurrection there. On
<PB N="147" REF="159"/>
this, the King had augmented the guards to twelve or fourteen thou∣sand men.</P>
<P>On the ninth of November the parliament met.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9th.</NOTE> They were alarmed
at the King's speech; and a debate ensued about it. The charge of go∣vernment

<P>The King was in danger from the prince of Orange. Bentinck

grievous agony, when he understood that the King was resolved
to see Monmouth; and, though he found that the duke had said
nothing of his <HI>master,</HI> he was never at quiet till his head was off. This
was so manifest to all, that lord Dartmouth, returning from the exe∣cution,
and giving the King an account of it, told him, that he had
got rid of one enemy, but had a more considerable and dangerous one
remaining.</P>
<P>The earl of Clarendon was dissatisfied with colonel R. Talbot's reform∣ation
and regulating of the army; yet he continued, till the beginning
of 1687. When the late King died, Sunderland was actually contriv∣ing
with the duchess of Portsmouth, to send the duke of York into ba∣nishment
again; and the duke knew it. They thought to send him
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>
on some embassy abroad, or deputy to Ireland, which Sunderland foresaw
would be his ruin; and he came to the earl of Rochester, immediately
after the King's accession, and told him, though it had been his misfor∣tune
to differ with him formerly, it was the effect of the times, not his
inclination. But, as he had a great esteem for him, he would use some
interest he had, that he might be treasurer, and his brother lord lieu∣tenant
of Ireland. So made his merit to them, of what he knew the
King had resolved on, before they asked it; not doubting but he would

<P>Sunderland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> besides having a pension from the prince of Orange, had
one from the King of France. He was the most mercenary man in
the world; veered with all winds. He got the King to establish a secret
council of Roman Catholics, to meet at his office, or Mr. Chiffinch's,
to consult of matters of religion. Being inclined to it, he drew by
degrees all business to it; and he himself was the umpire of all. It
consisted of the lords Arundel, Powis, Bellasis, Dover, Castlemain, and
father Petre. Castlemain was sent to Rome. Mr. Caryl had been sent
before; but more worthy. He got father Leyburn made a
bishop, <HI>in partibus,</HI> for England; but could not get Rinaldo d'Esté,
prince of Modena, and uncle to the Queen, made a cardinal. Father
Petre was made a privy councillor, contrary to his own judgment and
the Queen's advice, and a cardinal's cap sollicited for him. Petre was a
plausible, but a weak man, abounding in words. Sunderland extolled
his abilities; but he was not sworn till some time after.</P>
<P>It had long before been agreed, between Sunderland and father Petre,
Mr. Jermyn and lord Tyrconnel, that Petre should be a cardinal. Sun∣derland,
treasurer, &amp;c. The pope refused the cap; and Castlemain
quarrelled with him; only getting leave for the King to name three
vicars general, doctor Giffard, Smith, and father Ellis, a Benedictine, who
<PB N="149" REF="161"/>
were accordingly consecrated. The King took the chapel at St. James's
to himself; and left that of Whitehall to the protestants. He built one
there, from the ground, for his own use; settled fourteen Benedictine
monks in St. James's; gave the Jesuits leave to build one in the Sa∣voy;
and settled a college there, for the education of children; into
which, two hundred Roman Catholics were admitted. The Recollects
built a chapel in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and some Carmelits settled in the

taking away the test, as the judges had declared that his Majesty could

the bishops before the council, on the ninth of June, for a tumul∣tuary
petition, liable to a legal prosecution. They, refusing bail,
were committed to the Tower. The Queen expected to lye-in; and
did the next day. The princess Anne contrived to go to Bath, in
order to be absent when the Queen was brought to bed. The bishops,
perhaps, had some motive in forcing the King to imprison them: for
he would not only have taken their recognizance, but even their
word, for their appearance. Both were refused; because an imprison∣ment
would inflame the nation, and prevent the archbishop of Canter∣bury
from being at the Queen's delivery. The King had earnestly
pressed the princess Anne to stay, till the Queen should be deli∣vered;
but the doctor's opinion pleaded all delays dangerous. The

<P>In the case of the bishops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE> there is no doubt but the King had done
better, in not forcing some wheels, when he found the whole machine

advice of those who put him upon such dangerous councils, (vol. iv.
p. 322.) with intent to widen the breach between him and his subjects.
But his prepossession against the yielding temper, which had proved so
dangerous to his brother, and fatal to the King his father, fixed him in
a contrary method. He had always preached against the wavering coun∣cils
of his brother; and seeing that other bishops made not the same dif∣ficulty,
and since many complied, he thought the rest ought to do the
same. The King, therefore, gave more easily into the chancellor's opi∣nion,
who thought that a mere reprimand was not sufficient. It was,
however, a fatal council: for, besides the common reasons against it,
nothing ought to have made the King more cautious, in the matter,
than the present conjuncture, on account of the Queen's being with
child. It was that gave the alarm; and by consequence, required a
greater attention, to avoid every cause of complaint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<P>I received the letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Astle's Collection, vol. ii.</NOTE> which you, Sir, did me the honour of writing to me, while I was in the country, where I remained for some days. This is the reason I did not an∣swer you sooner; thanking you for the obliging offers which you made me, and ac∣quainting you, that the affair for which I quitted, is of such an extraordinary nature, that it would do an irreparable injury to that court, should it be divulged. The King your master would be agreeably revenged for Mr. Fagel's letter, if this affair was known in England. Three or four persons were acquainted with the whole of it, and several others know some particulars; for which reason I am surprised, that a discovery has not been made to your court. I have had consideration enough to be silent hitherto, altho' several English and Scotch, who are here, frequently felt my pulse; as did likewise some gentlemen of the place, to no purpose. If I was to divulge the affair, it would be to the King himself; because it regards her royal highness, as well as the prince and mon∣sieur de Bentinck. It is true, it regards much more the two last, and likewise a third principal person concerned, not to name several others. It regards his Majesty no further than that he would have a pleasure in knowing what passes at the court of the prince of Orange, and that the discovery would prejudice the prince in the eyes of the world. But if I could bring myself to such a resolution, I could discover to the King some very im∣portant things which regard him, and which came to my knowledge; for nothing passed at court, of which I was not informed, whatever use I might make of it. I wish such a desire may not seize me; and if you choose, Sir, that I should continue to write to you some∣times, and do me the favour to answer me, don't take it amiss, if I intreat you to re∣turn my letters, and I shall in like manner return yours; not because I do not put great confidence in your discretion, or would deprive you of the pleasure and advantage you may derive from sending them to court, but because I would choose that the letters should not, at least, be lost, after you have made all the use of them which is necessary for you; and that will engage me to be, with all kind of respect,</P>

England: that his master should look on it as a rupture with France,
and invade their country with 40,000 men, which, had it been pursued,
would have broke the design. Sunderland had persuaded the King it
was a French stratagem, and got him to reject all advice. He had still
credit to arraign this step, as affording the Dutch a pretence to arm, and
alarming England, with a French alliance against their religion. So the
King disclaimed M. d' Avaux's memorial to the Dutch ambassadour, and
in all foreign courts; and he called home Skelton, sending him to the
Tower, who, in a conference with Croissy, thinking Sunderland betrayed
the King, and intercepted letters had procured it; but was, soon after,

Your grace has that to say for yourself, which, perhaps, few others can say that were present. You did not hear a great part of what the witnesses said.

Lord Dover told me, the duke of Grafton owned to him, that, when
he went down to the fleet, a little before the prince of Orange came,
it was to prepare the commanders to be for him, which he did; and
assured him, that he had the words of two thirds of them. He owned,
that he and the rest of them had designs to have invited lord Dartmouth
on board captain Hasting or Matt. Aylmer, to have seized him there,
and declared for the prince of Orange; but did not say how it was not
done. Dover said, lord Godolphin and Churchill had informed him,
that lord Dartmouth had got them to speak to the prince of Orange,
that he might keep his place of master of the Ordnance; and they had
pressed for it.</P>
<P>The King was also told, that Dartmouth had written from Portsmouth
to the prince of Orange, that he had hindered the prince of Wales going
from thence.</P>
<P>I was informed from a very good hand, that the princess of Orange
seeing her husband much troubled, at the news of the King's being
gone for Ireland, told him, “he might thank himself for it, for letting
him go as he did.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Dawson being sent for, by the princess of Denmark, to come
to her, when she was dressing herself to go to her sister's coronation,
she asked Mrs. Dawson, if really the child, which was called her bro∣ther,
was the Queen's child? Mrs. Dawson answered her it was; and
that she could answer for it, as much as she could answer that she, the
princess, was the late duchess's, having seen them both born; and added,
that she wondered very much at her royal highness's asking her the question;
since she could not forget, that, when she was going to Bath, com∣ing
in the morning to take leave of the Queen, and her Majesty making
her feel her belly, she said to the Queen, by the child stirring so strong,
she believed the Queen would be brought to best before her return from
Bath. This I had from a gentlewoman who had it from Mrs. Dawson
herself.</P>
<P>Lord Churchill owned to lord Dover, before they last came from Lon∣don,
that the design of his and several other officers was laid long be∣fore
the prince of Orange landed.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="170"/>
Captain G. Churchill, commander of the Newcastle, owned to lord
Buckley, that he and captain Matt. Aylmer, with some other com∣manders,
had a design to have seized lord Dartmouth, before the prince
of Orange landed; and that the duke of Grafton, lord Berkeley, and
Sir J. Barry, knew of it. Captain Powel of the Queen's regiment of
Dragoons told cornet Recordan, that, when Sir J. Lanier was sent to
Jpswich, to oppose the prince of Orange's landing, in case he should
have endeavoured there, with the Queen's and the prince's regiments
of dragoons, Arran and Hamilton's horse, that Sir J. was resolved, if the
prince had landed, to have declared for him; and had agreed with ten
officers to have secured lord Arran, colonel Ric. Hamilton, and colonel
Connor.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of September, before the King gave any
credit to the advices, from his envoy at the Hague and others, of the
prince of Orange's design to invade him. The repeated assurances he
had from the States, by their ambassadour and others in their name, that
the preparations were not designed against him, the prince himself often
confirmed. Sunderland and others, the King trusted, persuaded him
it was impossible for the prince of Orange to go through with it;
and Sunderland turned any body to ridicule that seemed to believe it;
and, indeed, none that the King trusted, except Dartmouth, ever said
they credited the reports; and he, from the time of Monmouth's be∣heading,
always told the King he was confident, that, sooner or later,
he would attempt it. But though the King did not, till then, believe
it, he ordered more ships to be fitted out, to fortify the squadron at sea,
on the notion he had of the Dutch fitting out merchant ships; and though
he did not then accept of the King of France's offer of sixteen sail to
join his, yet he desired them to be ready at Brest, in case of need: and
when M. de Citters, the Dutch ambassadour, was alarmed at the report,
and took notice of it to the King; he answered, he did not intend to
make use of them, unless his masters obliged him to it.</P>
<P>The King, convinced of the Dutch invasion, went immediately from
Windsor to London; ordered his fleet to be made up thirty men of war,
all third and fourth rates, with sixteen sire-ships; and for troops of horse,
foot, and dragoons, to be recruited, ten men in each, except the guards;
<PB N="159" REF="171"/>
gave out commissions for new regiments of horse and foot; ordered the
troop of guards, regiment of horse, that of dragoons, and three battalions
of foot, to march from Scotland into England; sent for three battalions, a
regiment of foot and dragoons from Ireland: so that his troops would be,
in all, near 40,000 men. He thought this a sufficient force to deal with the
prince of Orange; as it would, if they had been faithful to him. Writs
had been issued for a parliament, and some elections made; but, as he
could not be at the head of the army and attend the parliament at the
same time, though both were necessary, he put off the meeting of par∣liament;
and, as his council and generality of his officers were averse to
French assistance, he did not send for the sixteen fail from Brest. Those
who had advised his measures, which gave most offence, were for un∣doing
all, even liberty of conscience, to disoblige the non-conformists;
now the church of England was offended. Of these was Sunderland,
catholic as he pretended to be, since his public declaration, in July last,
though he was privately reconciled some months before. He restored to
the church of England, Magdalen and Sidney colleges, which he had
designed for breeding up Roman Catholic scholars; but did not recall
liberty of conscience. The King had kept the original petition or re∣monstrance
of the seven bishops in his pocket; yet copies flew about.
The King drew his army near London. The earl of Dartmouth, Sir
Roger Strictland, and Sir J. Barry, were the three flag officers of the fleet.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange at first stood northward; but the wind turning
contrary, next day, and blowing very hard, dispersed many, and drove
them back to port. Lanier's, major general Arran's, and Hamilton's
regiments of horse, with the Queen's regiment of dragoons, under co∣lonel
Connor, were sent to Ipswich: two regiments of horse and one of
dragoons to Colchester. Dartmouth proposed to anchor to the east of
the Galloper, clear of the sands, to stretch away as he pleased; but
the east wind taking him, and blowing very fresh, he anchored
a-breast of the Longsand-head. The prince of Orange passed by to
the westward. Dartmouth's scouts took a Dutch fly-boat, a league and
a half a head. Why he did not sail is uncertain. He said he could not
get about the Longsand-head, as the wind and tyde were; yet some
commanders said he might have done it. If he could, and if the com∣manders
were true, he might have destroyed the fleet, or hindered their
<PB N="160" REF="172"/>
landing. Three battalions of guards, the King's regiment of dragoons,
and a hundred horse grenadiers, were ordered to Portsmouth; and, if
the prince of Orange had gone further, to march for Salisbury. The
rest of the troops were ordered to the west; Lanier to command the
troops at Salisbury, Sir J. Fenwick at Marlborough, and another body
ordered to Warminster; Feversham to come to Salisbury, and march
west, to hinder the prince of Orange's advance, and others from joining
him. This body consisted of twenty squadrons of old horse, and ten of
dragoons. All the foot were ordered to the same place.</P>
<P>The public talk in the prince of Orange's army was, that he was
betrayed, none coining to join him. His own officers were for re-em∣barking.
Colonel Strangeways, &amp;c. sent his letters to the King. None
joined him, till lord Cornbury began the defection, colonel of the King's
regiment of dragoons and chief officer, by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sentence here is illegible.</NOTE> ordered the King's regiment of foot, under Sir Francis
Compton, the lieutenant colonel, the duke of Berwick being at Ports∣mouth,
of three squadrons, St. Albans's two squadrons, under lieutenant
colonel Langston, Fenwick's two squadrons, to march, pretending or∣ders;
and accordingly marched to Blandford, Dorchester, and towards
Honiton. When his own major, Clifford, asked to see his orders, or,
at least, to know his design, in making so great a march towards the
enemy; Cornbury said, it was to beat up a quarter of horse in those
parts; and, when they came to Axminster, he commanded sixty dra∣goons
to fall into the quarter at Honiton. By this, major Littleton and
other officers, suspecting the matter, and beginning to question him,
Cornbury, the commander, went away, with those commanded men and
their lieutenant colonel Hayford, captain Russel, and the rest of the
captains then with the regiment, without letting the common men know
their intention. Langston followed with his two squadrons, being the
chief man that concerted with Cornbury; not letting his other officers
know of it.</P>
<P>When they came to Honiton, two regiments of the prince of Orange's
foot were ready to receive them; one commanded by Talmash. Being
there, Littleton told his men, that he had brought them to serve the
<PB N="161" REF="173"/>
prince of Orange; which Norton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Norton's own account of this affair, in the papers printed, in this collection, under the head of 1688.</NOTE>, his major, and several subalterns re∣fusing
to do, were immediately disarmed, dismounted, and plundered;
and, with much a-do, got leave to go back on foot to the King's army.
The other two regiments, finding themselves betrayed, marched back
in great disorder; only cornet Compton and two or three more subal∣terns,
with about ten troopers of the King's regiment of foot, deserted.
Clifford, major of dragoons, brought back the body of the regiment.
The common men were generally loyal, though so many of the officers
deserted; and many of St. Albans' troopers came back, as they found
opportunity, with their horses. Though the number of deserters was
inconsiderable, it was attended with bad consequences. It caused a
jealousy in the troops, who suspected one another; encouraged country
gentlemen to go in to the prince of Orange; and animated the enemy,
who were before discouraged. The King was at London when this hap∣pened.
Feversham was just come to Salisbury; and, thinking the re∣giments
gone, ordered those at Marlborough and Warminster to Salis∣bury,
the foot to Andover, and those on march to march back to Wind∣for,
Staines, &amp;c. This surprised all at London; and the King staid to
settle their minds before he went to Salisbury. He made a speech to
all the general officers about Cornbury's desertion; and offered to dis∣miss
them, if they did not care to serve: but all promised fidelity.</P>
<P>The duke of Grafton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> one of the first, set out for Salisbury on the
seventeenth. The prince of Wales was sent, at the same time, to Ports∣mouth,
under the escort of some Scotch horse and Irish dragoons: but
the night before he left London, some of the bishops presented a peti∣tion
signed by them and some peers, seventeen in all; of which the dukes
of Grafton and Ormonde, the marquis of Halifax, the earl of Not∣tingham,
and several considerable lords, having refused to join with them.
The King said it was too late at ten at night to give an answer in writ∣ting;
being to go next morning to Salisbury: that it was not a time to
call a parliament, nor fit for him to treat with the prince of Orange,
who had invaded, contrary to the laws of God, duty of a nephew and
son-in-law. He told the bishops, that it would have become them
<PB N="162" REF="174"/>
better to have declared their dislike of the invasion, than presenting
such a petition. The bishop of Winton and some others had been for
signing their dislike<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid, Original Papers, under the head of this year.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The King got to Salisbury too late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 19th.</NOTE> to execute his first project of ad∣vancing,
with horse and dragoons, to Axminster and Lamport, to hin∣der
the country's going in, to coop up the enemy, and with foot to sup∣port
them in hedges as good as retrenchments. The prince of Orange
at Axminster. The train of artillery, the Scots and Irish dragoons,
and a troop of horse guards, not come up. In the mean time, the King
resolved to visit the advanced quarter at Warminster, commanded by
major general Kirke, of the foot; Trelawney and Maine, brigadiers of
horse, who had the third troop of guards, Warden a troop of horse.
Two battalions of Dunbarton's, Kirke's, and the Queen's made the
two other battalions, and the Queen's regiment of dragoons. But
the evening before, his nose fell a bleeding, and doing so next morn∣ing
a considerable quantity, and continuing to do so several times
that day, he was obliged not to go, but to be let blood. It was
three days before it could be quite stopped. It is generally believed,
had it not been for this accident, that Churchill, Kirke, Trelawney,
&amp;c. who deserted soon after, with some in that quarter, had designed
to seize the King, in going thither or coming back, and have carried
him to the prince of Orange. It was easy enough to do; the King
having no suspicion of them. But, a few days after, he began to doubt
some of them; and once intended to secure Churchill and the duke of
Grafton, and have sent them to Portsmouth; but, on further consider∣ation,
did not think fit to do it.</P>
<P>In a council of all the officers, Feversham, count de Roy, lord Dum∣barton,
and the truly loyal, advised retiring to London: Churchill, &amp;c.
were for staying at Salisbury. The first advice was followed; and
Churchill and Grafton went off that night or the next. Schomberg said
to Churchill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher∣son's Ex∣tracts.</NOTE> when he arrived, “That he was the first lieutenant general
he had ever heard that had deserted from his colours.” The next morning
advice came, that Rogers, lieutenant of horse grenadiers, colonel Lawson,
<PB N="163" REF="175"/>
captain S. George, and two or three other captains of the queen's regiment
of dragoons, were gone from Warminster, with some few of the common
men. Kirke did not execute his orders for marching to the Devizes, and,
by Hungerford, to Reading. The King marched the same day; de∣signing
to post behind the Thames the foot and horse of the army; but
ordered Feversham to stay behind, with horse and dragoons to cat up the
forage and maintain Reading as long as he could, without exposing
himself to have his quarter beaten up. The King went from Salisbury
the first night to Andover; and that night prince George, the duke of
Ormond, lord Drumlanrick, and others, deserted, and several officers
from other quarters. The King, fearing Kirke would do so too, ordered
Dumbarton to take two squadrons of horse to help bringing off the four
battalions of foot ordered from Warminster. But before he could join
them, as they were to march from the Devizes, Brigadier Trelawney,
who commanded them, with lieutenant colonel Churchill, and all his
captains, but captain Fox, and about twenty or thirty common men, and
some subalterns, deserted; the rest of the men, being loyal, would
not go.</P>
<P>The King continued his march to London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26th.</NOTE> and the troops were sent
to their quarters at Maidenhead, Windsor, Staines, Egham, Chertsey, and
Colnbroke. Every day some officers, though few common men, deserted.
The King, arriving, on the twenty-sixth of November, at London, found
his daughter, the princess of Denmark, had gone off, with lady Churchill
and Mrs. Berkley. Whether it was by prince George's directions, or
the two ladies advice, is uncertain, though with child, and much afraid;
being apt to miscarry. She was under the bishop of London's conduct,
at least he met her, as soon as she was out of town. This made a great
noise in town; and her nurse and the earl of Clarendon went up and
down like mad persons, saying the papists had murdered her; and asking
some of the Queen's people what they had done with her: But it was
known the next day which way she went. Some days after, a letter of
hers, or bearing that title, to the Queen, came out in print; as if she
left it on the table, when she went off. But no such was found; or,
at least, delivered to the Queen. Prince George and lord Churchill sent
letters to the King, with reasons for their withdrawing. The duke of
Berwick coming to the army, lord Dover had been sent to command in
<PB N="164" REF="176"/>
Portsmouth. Orders to send away the prince of Wales to France, if
things grew worse; and to the captain of the Mary yaucht, to transport
him; and lord Dartmouth, to facilitate it, who was come to Spithead,
with his fleet much shattered, by ill weather. He had got the length
of Torbay, and saw the prince of Orange's fleet at anchor, under Herbert.
But the weather was so bad, that he could attempt nothing on them;
and his fleet was much dispersed and damaged. Some were forced back
to the Downs, Dartmouth himself to Spithead, and captain G. Churchill
put into Plymouth to stop a leak: And, finding the place had declared
for the prince of Orange, he did so too.</P>
<P>None of the deserters surprized the King so much as the earl of Bath,
who had received so much from the crown, and was of so loyal a
family. Till then, thought above temptation to do an ill action; but
he declared, and secured the earl of Huntingdon, whose regiment was
in garrison in the citadel, and all the Roman catholic officers, and
common men of that persuasion, and kept them prisoners; Ferd.
Hastings, his cousin's lieutenant colonel, and some other officers, joining
with him in it. Every body now vied, who should first abandon the
King; who, soon after his arrival at London, had advice, that Sir G.
Hanmer, lieutenant colonel of Montgomery's regiment, in garrison at
Hull, hearing that several lords were up in several parts of the realm,
and combining with Copely, the lieutenant governor, the present officer
and some magistrates, had surprised the governor, lord Langdale, and
lord Montgomery, by night, in their lodgings, declared for the protestant
religion, and kept these two lords, and some Roman Catholic gentlemen
of the country, who had retired there for sasety, prisoners; and then let
them go. Before this, lord Danby, and many other persons of quality, had
met at York, and seized Sir J. Rearsby, who had only the name of Gover∣nor,
having but one company of foot with him, and declared for a free
parliament: And the prince of Orange seized all the King's money in the
collector's hands, disarmed the Roman Catholics, demolished the Roman
Catholic chapel in the town, and raised men, forming them into compa∣nies
and troops. About the same time, the earl of Devon sent to the
duke of Newcastle to come and join him. He got some Nottingham∣shire
gentlemen together, and declared as Danby did; but the duke of
Newcastle refusing, he plundered him of what arms and horse he had at
<PB N="165" REF="177"/>
Welbeck. Before this, lord Delamere was up in Cheshire and Lanca∣shire,
on the same account. He disarmed the Roman Catholics and some
new raised men, demolished the Roman Catholic chapels, and roved
about with four or five hundred disorderly ill-armed men.</P>
<P>The King wrote to the lords Dover and Dartmouth to send off the
prince of Wales, most of whose baggage was on board; when Dart∣mouth,
sending for Dover to dine with him, told him it was against the
law to send the prince of Wales out of England, without more positive
orders; and he would not let it be done; and every night after, he exa∣mined
every boat and vessel that went out. He had before sent up a strange
address, by lord Berkeley, signed by the commanders of the fleet, for
calling a parliament and declaring for the protestant religion. The fleet
would certainly have fought at first, their animosity was such against the
Dutch. But the case was altered. The prince of Wales was sent for
to London, under escort of Salisbury and Holmes's regiments of horse
and some Irish dragoons, which they did in two days.</P>
<P>In a meeting of lords, the King was advised to treat with the prince
of Orange. He sent Halifax, Nottingham, and Godolphin with pro∣posals
to him. When they came to Andover, the prince of Orange sent
them word to go to Ramsbury, where he delayed them a day or two.
When his answer came, the King resolved to go away with the Queen
and prince.</P>
<P>Monday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10th.</NOTE> about twelve at night, the tenth of December, the King
went privately from Whitehall to Vauxhall. He there took horse about
one, with Sir E. Hales, Sir E. Quartermaster, and a guide. He passed the
Medway, at Ailesford-bridge, took fresh horse at Woolpeck, sent before
by Ralph Sheldon, an equerry. He got, by ten, to Emby-ferry, near
Feversham; where a Custom-house hoy, hired by Sir Edward Hales,
waited for them. When on board, they found it had no ballast; and
it blowing fresh, the master easily persuaded the King to let him take in
ballast at Shelness. It was half ebb before they ran ashore to take it in;
designing to sail as soon as afloat, which would have been about eleven.
He was near afloat, when three fisher-boats, of Feversham, with fifty
men, boarded them, seized the King and two others, as was said by
orders from those of Feversham; supposing them papists endeavouring
to escape; and, when the vessel was afloat, turned with the tide up Fe∣versham
<PB N="166" REF="178"/>
water. The King was not, however, known. Sir E. Hales
whispered the captain, and clapt fifty guineas privately into his hand, as
an earnest of more, if he would let them go before they were put ashore.
The captain promised, but kept not his word. Coming to anchor be∣fore
the mouth of the creek, he went to the master and told him, that
he had Sir E. Hales and two more on board; then came back and took
what money they had, under pretence of securing it from the seamen;
yet the seamen came down and searched them.</P>
<P>They were guarded to town, in a coach, by one Edwards, and some
rabble, to an inn, where the King was discovered, and was told, lord
Winchelsea and most of the country gentlemen were at Canterbury.
He sent to him to come. In the meantime, the King tried to get off;
and had got a custom-house smack. But Edwards and the rabble beset
the inn so, that the King could not get to the horses he had got to carry
him to the boat. Several protestants and Roman Catholics had been seized
on the road, as judge Jenner, R. Graham, Mr. Burton, protestants; Mr.
Arundel, and two ladies of that name, with Dr. Obadiah Walker, and
three or four more Roman Catholics. The King lodged at Mr.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
a loyal man. The earl of Winchelsea came. The seamen guarded the
King; but said a hair of his head should not be touched. Sir B. Dixwell
and Sir James Oxenden came next day with militia, on pretence of securing
the King from the rabble; but it was to hinder his escape. Those, who
came last, were very rude. The King's letter, for cloaths, linen, and
money, from London, was stopped one night. Lord Feversham, with
some horse guards and horse grenadiers, coming to convey the King to
London; they sent to the prince of Orange, for orders what to do with
the King. Early on Saturday morning, Feversham came to the King
and told him, that the guards were at Sittingburn. The King was con∣veyed
thither by the militia, and by the guards to Rochester that night;
and he sent Feversham to the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>The Queen and the prince of Wales were sent away privately, on the
ninth of December, at night, under the conduct of the Count de Lau∣zun,
in a yaucht, commanded by captain Gray. The King sent the
prince of Orange word, that he would be at London, on Monday, and
treat to settle the nation. He doubted the fidelity of the troops, and
passed to Whitehall, through the city. It was not to be imagined, the
<PB N="167" REF="179"/>
acclamations that were made, and the joy shewed at his coming back, among
all orders of men. He never law the like. Whitehall was crowded, and
the like joy prevailed there. But he had no sooner got to his bed∣chamber,
than Zulestein came, with a letter from the prince of Orange,
that what Feversham proposed was of too great consequence to be an∣swered
then; and the King had best stay at Rochcster. The King said,
had Zulestein come before he left it, he would have slaid there; but
now he hoped the prince of Orange, then at Windsor, would come next
day to St. James's, to speak about his proposal by Feversham. Zule∣stein
said, he believed the prince of Orange would not come, till the
King's troops were sent out of town. The King gave him a letter to the
prince of Orange; and, upon hearing that Feversham was consined, he
expressed to Zulestein his surprize, at a breach of the law of nations,
and desired the prince of Orange would release him. But he neither did
it, nor sent any answer to the King's letter. Next day, the prince of
Orange left Feversham prisoner in Windsor castle, and came to Sion;
and, at nine at night, the King was informed, that count Solmes was com∣ing
with the prince of Orange's guards to take post at Whitehall. But
he supposed they would only do so at St. James's, where the prince of
Orange was to come the next day. But at eleven that night, the earl of
Craven came to the King, as he was going to bed, and told him, that
Solmes was in the Park, with three battalions of the prince of Orange's
foot guards and horse; and said he had orders to take post in Whitehall,
The King sent for Solmes, and told him, that he believed it was a mis∣take.
But Solmes said his orders were positive for Whitehall, and
shewed them to the King. After arguing the matter, the King told
Craven, that he might draw off his men, and let Solmes take post; which
he did immediately.</P>
<P>Shrewsbury and Delamere were with Solmes in the park; but came not
up with him. Soon after one in the night, the earl of Middleton waked
the King, who was asleep, and told him, that Halifax, Shrewsbury, and
Delamere had called him up, and told him, they had a message from the
prince of Orange to deliver immediately to the King. They would not stay
till morning. They were called in, and delivered a paper, signed by the
prince of Orange: That to avoid disorders, which the King's presence in
London might occasion, he would positively have the King to go to Ham;
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>
and to be gone before ten, with what servants he would, and the prince
of Orange would send guards to secure him. The King excepted to
Ham, as not being furnished, and a bad winter; and had rather go to
Rochester, as mentioned in the prince of Orange's letter, by Zulestein.
They said they would ask the prince of Orange, and bring an answer by
nine; but he must positively be gone before ten. The King had said he
might be guarded there by some of his own foot; but Solmes sent a
party with him. The King would have gone by water to Gravesend, but
Halifax opposed it rudely. Shrewsbury was very fair and civil, and
agreed to the King's desire; who took barge, attended by a hundred of
the prince of Orange's guards, before and behind it. They were so long
of embarking, that they lost the tide. The King arrived not till seven at
night. He lay there that night; and, next day, he received a blank
pass, from the prince of Orange, to send one to London. The guards
not being exact at Rochester, the King was confirmed in his opinion,
that the prince of Orange wanted to have him gone; and he that brought
the pass, brought orders to the captain of the guards not to look so
strictly after him; so they put centinels at the fore-door towards the
street, but none to the back-door towards the river; yet the King ap∣prehended,
if he did not get off, that the prince of Orange would have
sent him out of the world another way.</P>

<P>The King came to Rochester, on the nineteenth of December, in the
morning, where he staid till the twenty-second, at night. Several of his
servants, the lords Arran, Dumbarton, Ailesbury, Litchfield, gentlemen
of the bed-chamber; three of his grooms, F. Griffin, and Biddolph;
major generals Fenwick and Sackville; Sir J. Talbot, brigadier;

<P>The prince of Orange had convened all the lords spiritual and tempo∣ral.
The archbishop of Canterbury refused to come, or do any thing
while the King was under restraint. The lords adjourned, next day, to
<PB N="169" REF="181"/>
the house of lords, at Westminster. Some bishops and others advised
the King not to go, at least not out of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts.</NOTE> Doctor Bradey, his
physician, was sent to him, and argued the matter; but could not con∣vince
the king they did not think the prince of Orange would attempt
his life. He argued it afterwards with lord Middleton, who owned, at
last, there was no safety in staying. The King resolved to go.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange had sent word to the lord mayor and aldermen,
not to give oaths of allegiance and supremacy, or test, to the common-council,
chosen on the twenty-first of December: and he ordered them
to act, without taking them.</P>
<P>Captain Macdonald bringing word, before twelve at night, on the
twenty-second of December, that captain Trevanion was come up with
the shallop; the King left a paper, with reasons of his withdrawing.
He charged lord Middleton to have it printed, when he got to London;
but left it with Dumbarton to be given, next day, to Middleton. The
King told the earl of Litchfield of it; trusting him entirely, a man of
great honour, and who had always served with steadiness and fidelity.
He was forced also to trust Ailesbury with it; else he would have lain
in his bed-chamber, with the servants, a room through which the King
was to pass.</P>
<P>The King went to bed, at his usual hour. As soon as the company
were gone, he got up, dressed, and went, by the back-stairs, through the
garden, where Macdonald staid for him, with the duke of Berwick and
Mr. Biddolph, to show him the way to Trevanion's boat. About twelve
at night, they rowed down to the smack, which was waiting without
the fort at Sheerness. It blew so hard right a-head, and ebb tide be∣ing
done before they got to the Salt Pans, that it was near six before
they got to the smack. Captain Trevanion not being able to trust the
officers of his ship, they got on board the Eagle fireship, commanded by
captain Wilford; on which, the wind and tide being against them, they
staid till day-break, when the King went on board the smack. It blew
so very hard, E. N. E. and E. N. when they got to the Buoy of the
Nore, that they durst not venture to turn down any lower, and they
were obliged to bear up the river towards Lee, and anchor on the Essex
shore, under the lee of the sand, in smooth water, till the next tide of
flood should be gone. It blew very hard all that day, being Sunday.
<PB N="170" REF="182"/>
As it began to be dark, the gale slackened a little; so that when the
tide broke, they got under sail, and turned down as far as the Red Sand.
Next morning, the weather being fair, they got under sail before
sun-rise; and, without tacking, reached the buoy off the Narrows,
turned through it, and so to North-foreland; designing to go on the
back of the Goodwin, and not through the Downs. But they could
not weather it, and so went through the Downs. There seven ships lay
at anchor; but not one under sail. It began to snow about fix; and
not being able to fetch Calais, they bore away for Boulogne, and an∣chored
before Ambleteuse, where they landed, about three on Tuesday
morning, Christmas-day.</P>

<HEAD>1689.</HEAD>
<P>The King landed at Kinsale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689. Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE> on the 12th of March. He found a
great deal of good will in that kingdom, but little means to execute
it; which made the prince of Orange slight it to the degree he did.
The fear of disgusting the Irish catholics, on whom he wholly depended,
and the hopes of recompensing such protestants as suffered by the act for
rescinding the acts of settlement, induced the King, at last, to give his
royal assent, though he saw it was highly prejudicial to his interest.
Nothing, but the unwillingness to disgust his only friends, could prevail
with him to foreclose himself in the act of attainder, from the power of
pardoning those comprised in it; and to agree to such diminutions of
his authority, as that the acts of the English parliament should not be
binding in Ireland, nor that writs of error and appeals should be carried
from thence to England. It would, without doubt, have been more
generous in the Irish, not to have pressed so hard upon their prince,
when he lay so much at their mercy; and more prudent not to have
grasped at gaining all, before they were sure of keeping what they al∣ready
possessed. He gave his royal assent, with good will, only to the
act for liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>[Mr. Thomas Carte made no extracts, from the memoirs of James,
concerning the transactions of 1689; probably for the same reasons
which induced the editor to content himself with the preceding; having
<PB N="171" REF="183"/>
found, among Nairne's papers, the original materials, from which James
composed his memoirs for the present year. That prince usually wrote,
with his own hand, all the occurrences of the times, or examined and
corrected what was written by others. He sometimes wrote down his
instant reflections and conjectures on the state of his affairs, and the ex∣pected
effects of his measures, without waiting to see what time might
determine. The pen must have been constantly in his hand. The first
paper which occurs, relating to the transactions of this year, is a journal,
in his own hand, containing an account of some intelligence he received,
when on his journey from Cork to Dublin.</P>
<P>The journal which immediately follows the intelligence, in James's
own hand, contains an account of what passed in Ireland, from his land∣ing
at Kinsale, on the 12th of March, O. S. 1689, to the 18th of July,
when he prorogued the parliament. There are two copies of it among
Nairne's papers; one in French, and another in English, which is full
of French idioms. The language and orthography of the French copy,
which is in Nairne's hand, is the most correct. There are some ad∣ditions
in the margin, by lord Melfort, in French; and several, by
James himself, in English. From the mention made of it in James's
instructions to lord Dover, it appears he intended it for the information
of Lewis XIV. However, the English copy, from which the other is
said to be a translation, is printed here, though corrected in some few
places according to the French, which is more exact. The additions
are placed in the margin, as they occur in the margin of the French
copy. The variations are carefully marked, and the letters and memo∣rials,
from which the journal was framed, are placed at the bottom of
the page, as further illustrations of the subject.</P>
<P>This journal may be reckoned, in a great measure, the work of James,
from the corrections, alterations, and additions in his own hand. The
account which he gives, in his memoirs of the military transactions in
Ireland, during the year 1689, is but an abstract of what this and the
following journal contain; and these journals were composed from the
letters which James received from his generals; and of which some are
inserted, as vouchers and illustrations, in the notes.]</P>

an account, that Kirke came thither on the 14, in the morning about
seven, with six squadrons of horse and dragoons and fifteen hundred foot,
all of Schomberg's owne army; they marched into the towne, designing,
as was believed, to attaque the fort on that side: but brigad. Wachop,
who commanded there, having left some men in three strong store-houses
in the towne, to preserve it, they obliged the enemie to march out of
it, leaving six of their men slain in the street. What others they had
killed or wounded there, is not knowne. There had been greater, if
some of the protestant inhabitants had not advertised the enemie, as
they were marching on, of some of Wachop's men being in those
houses; for had they not had that notice, they had come up close to
them; our men having had orders from the brigadier, not to fire till
they were just under them; and they kept close, till they saw the ene∣mie
begin to march back, who were come within half musket-shot, and
so did that execution on them. After this, they marched up to the
fort on the other side; but, after viewing it, and having skirmished for
some time, they finding it stronger and better provided than they ex∣pected,
marched, about two in the afternone, back for Belturbatt. What
men they lost on that side, one cannot certainly say, only that from the
fort they saw them carry of several dead bodies on horse-back befor them.
It's probable their designe was to take the fort, or to burn the towne,
since they came with so great a body. They only burnt two small ca∣bins

away. But the Pink's men sired so fast on them, that one of the boats
cryed for quarter, and rowed on board and yielded. The third got off.
But most of her men were killed or wounded. As soon as it was night,
the Pink warped out of the harbour, the wind blowing right in; and,
by that tyme 'twas day, got clear of the mouth of it. The enemy, by
that tyme, got downe to the sea-side, and on the rocks, in great num∣bers.
A regiment of foot being quartered hard by, fired some small
shot, which did no harme; and to the country towards Derry stayd there
about three days, plundered, the country, and brought back with them
some twelve horses, loaden with plunder, and some ready money they
met with.</P>
<P>I have had an account from Castleblany, that a party of Macmahon's,
and some of the garrison of Dundalk, having met a party of the enemy,
not far from Castleblany, who came a cow-stealing, fell on them, beat
them, and killed 20 on the spot, and took 10 prisoners.</P>

<P>The Pink, which carried gen. major Buchan into Scotland, is come
back to Broadhaven, in the county of Mayo, gives an account, that she
had a long passage back from the Isle of Mull, and endeavoured to have
put into Sligo. But being near to Killibeg, in the county of Donegalle,
put into that harbour; believing it to be in the King's possession; but no
sooner in, than they found they were mistaken; and, it blowing hard,
and right into the harbour, the mouth of which was very narrow, so
that they could not turn out, came to anchor. The Pink got of, and
brought away the captain, the two masters, 20 souldiers and seamen

prisoners to Broadhaven. In this Pink came as passengers, Sir Alexander
M'Laine, colonel James▪ Pursell, Sir George Berkley, and Mr. Hays,

though the enemy had notice of their march, and had way-laid them.

<HEAD>“A Journal of what passed in Ireland, from his Majestie's arrival,
on the 12th of March, Old Stile, to the 18th of July, 1689,
when he prorogued the parliament.”</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty arrived in his kingdom of Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> the 12 of March,
O. S. 1689; and was received, at Kinsale, where he landed, with
all the demonstrations of joy imaginable.</P>
<P>His Majesty's first care was to have the money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No 6.</NOTE> arms, and ammuni∣tion,
which he brought along with him from France, safely landed and
secured in his fort of Kinsale; and, <HI>because one part thereof was sent by
Mr. de Louvois, and the other by Mr. Seignelay, his Majesty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are omitted in the French translation.</NOTE> ordered
one of his servants to receive that of Mr. de Louvois, and to deliver it
to the Sieur de Pointis, that he might take care and give an account
thereof; having, for that end, several commissaries under him: all
which was done, with great readiness and care, and in a few days.</P>
<P>After this was done, his Majesty calling into his council the count
d'Avaux, embassador of France, and the earl of Melford, caused him∣self
to be informed, in their presence, of the posture of affairs in this
kingdom, by those of the country that were come to wait upon him at
his landing; but chiefly by Sir Thomas Nugent, lord chief justice of
<PB N="175" REF="187"/>
Ireland, and his lieutenant general, the lord Mount Cashell. He found
by these, that the lord deputy of Ireland, finding the designs of the prince
of Orange succeed so well in England, and that the half of the Irish
army was there, and consequently lost for his Majesty's service, had en∣deavoured
to supply this defect, by giving commissions to raise men,
to all whom either the love of their religion, their King, or their country
incited to accept thereof. That the fidelity of the Irish, and their zeal
for his Majesty's service, had appeared so extraordinary, on this oc∣casion,
that, in less than a month, there were above one hundred thou∣sand
men on foot. The reputation of which alone, was sufficient to hin∣der
the prince of Orange from attempting any thing against Ireland,
without very great preparations. That this thing alone had saved the
kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The prince of Orange has been much blamed for his long neglect of the affairs of Ireland, and his conduct was variously accounted for. Some said, that he was deceived by Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>connel's assurances of attachment and fidelity; others affirmed, that he was wil∣ling to give the Irish an opportunity of rising in arms, that he might enrich his fol∣lowers by forseitures; and those who were disposed to judge with more candor, alleged▪ that he followed the opinion of the marquis of Hallifax, that an unsettled state of affairs in Ireland, would compel the English to a speedy settlement of England. But the writer of this Journal, with less malignity and resinement, gives another account of the prince's supposed inattention.</NOTE>. But that, on the other side, it was attended with great
inconveniencies; for the troops being raised, and having no pay, were
forced to live on the people; and, though the officers had undertaken
to maintain them at their own charge, there were very few that did it:
effectually.</P>
<P>That the lord deputy had done another thing very necessary for the
safety of Ireland, by disarming, the protestants and seizing their horses.
But that too brought inconveniencies along with it, and caused so great
disorder, that every catholique thought himselfe entitled to pillage the
protestants, and render back to them the same usage they had before
received at their hands. This so provoked the protestants, being already
too much inclined to revolt, that they took occasion to assemble pub∣lickly
for the forming themselves into troops; and committed great dis∣orders,
particularly in the North and at Banden.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="188"/>
That the rebels at Banden had been reduced without much difficulty;
and that those in the North were so near being so, that it was not doubted
but the first news from that country would bring the news of it; and
that his Majesty should have no ground to fear any ill consequence from
that side.</P>
<P>His Majesty, applying himself after this to the forming of his army,
gave orders to his lieutenant general, the lord Mount Cashell, to form
seven regiments of foot, of the forces raised in those quarters, as also
to arm the regiment of dragoons of Sir James Cottar, and to transport
the rest of the armes to Dublin, with all speede. Having ordered this,
and, with much trouble, found horses to carry the French officers to
Dublin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nairne's Papers, D. N. 1. No. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>His Majesty was no sooner arrived at Cork, than he caused an exact
view to be taken of that place; and finding it in a reasonable good condi∣tion,
he gave orders for the strengthening the garrison, and the leaving
some ammunition and fifty thousand livres there, for the paying some
small subsistence to the soldiers; of which there were a great many in
that country. <HI>It was here, that his Majesty, having received a great num∣ber
of petitions for leave to transport wool into England, refused them all;
but gave a general liberty for the transporting into France, which had been
done in great aboundance, but that vessels were wanted</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are inserted here in the English text. But they are on the margin of the French text in Lord Melfort's hand.</NOTE>. It was here too
that his Majesty began to find the difficulty of transporting his arms and
ammunition, as he designed, as well by reason of the unfitness of the
carriages used in the country, as of the ill ways; and that the general
officers and others of his train, having taken all the horses, and several
not paying for them, had caused the country people to drive what they
<PB N="177" REF="189"/>
had remaining into the mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> from whence it was impossible to get
them. His Majesty having remained some days at Cork, the earl of
Tyrconnel came thither to wait upon him; and was immediately created
Duke, in recompence of his great services, and successful endeavours
towards the preservation of the kingdom of Ireland. He brought along
with him the news of the rebels being defeated, by Hamilton, at Dro∣more;
and that he pursued them so briskly, that he hoped to reduce
them entirely, before any recruits could be sent him; and, in this belief,
most people continued for some time after his Majesty's arrival at
Dublin.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French text in Melfort's hand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the way from Cork to Dublin,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">The lieutenant general Ha∣milton was advanced to this rank by the duke of Tyrconnell, before the King's arri∣val, without the King's knowing any thing about it until he ar∣rived, as also the viscount Mount Cashell and some bri∣gadiers.</NOTE> his Majesty settled several things
much out of order in the country; and on the road, found every where
troops of peasants armed with long sticks, tip'd with iron at one end;
and even those troops, which were said to be armed, had only half of
them pikes and half musquets; of which, two in one hundred were not
fit for service; <HI>the officers were almost all natives differing little from the
soldiers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are wanting in the English, but are inserted in the French text—The translator, by saying that the officers were <HI>gens du pais peu differentes des sol∣dats,</HI> means perhaps that they were peasants as well as the soldiers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His Majesty arriving at Dublin, and finding the troubles in the north
still prolonged, and that he had been but ill informed of the number and
resolution of the rebels, and well knowing of what importance it was to
him, to put an end to the disorders of this Kingdom; he resolved to send
more troops yet to the north, to strengthen those with Hamilton. But
his first care was to form a council, in which all affairs should be de∣bated;
and resolved it should consist of the French ambassador, the duke
of Tyrconnel, and the Earl of Melfort.</P>
<P>It was in this council, where it was considered, what troops should
be sent to strengthen the camp of Hamilton, who was not strong enough
to take Coleraine, much less to attack Derry. It was agreed, that his
Majesty should send some regiments to block up Coleraine, on the other
side of the river; and that they should be commanded by the duke of
Berwick and the marquis de Pusignian. But it happened, that the com∣mission
of general major, granted to the duke of Berwick, was of an
ancienter date than that of the marquis de Pusignian. The King, to
<PB N="178" REF="190"/>
shew the particular esteem he had for the French, on all occasions, would
not suffer the duke of Berwick to command the marquis, on that occa∣sion.
But sent him straight to Hamilton, and left to the marquis the
sole command of the detachment; the troops of which he doubted not
to be in a good condition and fit to march, being the first that were
armed of the new levies.</P>
<P>This detachment consisted of five regiments of foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French trans∣lation in the King's hand. <HI>A mistake as to the troops.</HI></NOTE> that is Bellow,
Germanstowne, Louth, Neugent, and Moore; the duke of Tyrconnell's
regiment of horse, captain Burke's troop of horse, and another detach∣ment
commanded by the lord Gallmoy, brigadier, consisting of one hun∣dred and
sixty-five horse, one hundred dragoons, and five hundred and
sixty foot; which made, in all, with the other troops that were already,
in the North, eleven thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight foot, seven
hundred and thirty-five horse, and seven hundred and fifty dragoons;
and, because his Majesty was informed, that the free communication,
that those of Coleraine had with those of Derry, did very much hinder
the taking of the first of those places, he commanded Monsieur de Pu∣signian
to march, with the detachment under his command, betwixt the
two rivers; by that means to hinder their communication for the future.</P>
<P>Whilst the troops, thus destined, prepared themselves for their gene∣ral
rendezvous at Charlemount, the King consulted with his general
officers at Dublin about the siege of Derry, in case Coleraine should be
taken. It was proposed, to prepare store of tools and other things ne∣cessary
for a siege. Upon which, his Majesty caused his magazines to
be looked into. But, instead of finding things necessary, as he expected,
he was informed, by the earl of Melfort, who had visited the said ma∣gazines,
by his order, that there was nothing at all of what was required,
nor even any thing that looked like a magazine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See “<HI>An account of arms,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol i. fol. No. 64.</NOTE> <HI>ammunition and other habilaments of war, remaining in the

was obliged, for the repairing of this defect, to set people at work im∣mediately

were delayed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ma∣gazines marke No.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and by that means, the army was not so soon provided,
as they should have been, with the tools that were necessary. Even this
his Majesty began to look out after, providing cannon, of which there
was not one piece of battery ready mounted in all Ireland, of field-pieces
but twelve, in all of which three were with Hamilton, and two little
mortars, the two great mortars and two of a middle size (which were all
that were in the kingdom) not being in a condition to march.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Pusignian, who was to command the troops destined for
the recruit of Hamilton, would have deferred his departure to join the
said troops, till some cannon could be mounted to march along with
him. But being assured, that there were some at Charlemount, both bet∣ter
and readier for service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> he parted from Dublin the 2d or 3d day of
April, and went streight to Charlemount, where he found only two or∣dinary
batards fit for service, and those two without carriages.</P>
<P>It being there and at Dungannon, where the troops under his com∣mand
were to rendezvous, he expected to have found them there at his
arrival, but they, being little acquainted with military discipline, came
two or three days short, which the Sieur de Pusignian, not to lose time,
employed in mounting the two pieces of cannon he found at Charle∣mount,
by the workmen which he carried along with him from Dublin.</P>
<P>Whilst things went thus in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> news was brought from Scotland,
that the convention was assembled at Edinburgh, that the duke of Ha∣milton
was president thereof, and that his Majesty's letters had with
much difficulty been allowed to be read, and in fine his friends, and
those that were faithful to his interest, had quitted the convention, find∣ing
things carried on against his interest with the violence which they
could not oppose.</P>
<P>His Majesty, to neglect nothing that might confirm his friends in
their fidelity, and reduce his enemies to their duty, took that occasion
to publish his declaration of the first of April, of which he sent several
<PB N="180" REF="192"/>
copies into Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A marginal note to the French and English copies of this Journal refers to the
printed proclamation. D. N. 1. fol. No. 2.</NOTE>. He dispatcheth also two or three persons of
trust into England and Scotland, to have, by them, a more certain ac∣count
of the posture of affairs in those countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French trans∣lation in the King's hand. <HI>Le chevalier Mac Lean et le Sieur Mac Donald.</HI></NOTE> and to carry letters to
those of his subjects who espoused his interest, and were capable to serve
him, with commissions to raise men upon occasion. He sent at the same
time two young Scotch noblemen, who came with him from France,
and who had great interest in the Highlands, giving them commissions
to raise regiments and arm all their friends and followers.</P>
<P>About this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE> his Majesty applying himself incessantly to provide
for the good and welfare of his subjects of Ireland, and finding that
there were above one hundred thousand men of foot, which were a charge
as well to the people as to the officers who raised them, resolved imme∣diately
to reduce them to a letter number, and gave his orders to that
effect to the duke of Tyrconnel, who disbanding all the rest, reserved
only, according to the King's intentions, seven regiments of horse, of
which one was of nine, three of eight, and three of six troops; seven
regiments of dragoons, of which three of twelve troops, and four of
ten; and thirty-five regiments of foot, of which the regiment of guards
had two battalions, and the rest thirteen companies each, every com∣pany
of sixty-two men. Having thus reduced this great army to a more
compact number, his Majesty gave orders to bring the arms without
delay, that those whom he thought fit to be kept on foot might, by re∣ceiving
them, be fit for service.</P>
<P>Having thus provided for the reform and arming of his forces, and
left the care of seeing his orders put in execution to the duke of Tyr∣connell,
his Majesty resolved to goe to Charlemont, in person, to see the
troops that were there, under the command of the marquis de Pusig∣nian,
which he did as well to animate the soldiers by his presence, as to
see himself what they wanted, and to give orders on the spot for their
supply, <HI>being extreamly surprised at the ill posture in which he was informed
the marquis de Pusignian had found them</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are in the French text in lord Melfort's hand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="193"/>
He was also persuaded to this voyage, because he should be there both
nearer to Londonderry, in case his affairs required his presence there,
and nearer to the coast of Scotland, whither he might send what troops
he might judge necessary, with more expedition, in case Derry should
surrender, which would have been of very great consequence and ad∣vantage,
as well for the frightening of his enimies, as the fortifying his
friends, and preserving and encouraging in their duty those of his ser∣vants
and subjects that began to waver, <HI>his approaching that way making
them hourly fear his passing into Scotland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These words are in a marginal note to the French text in lord Melfort's hand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He parted from Dublin the 8th day of April, and two days after the
duke of Tyrconnell parted from thence also, and went thro' all the
garrisons to execute his Majesty's orders, for the arming and reforming
his forces, which his Majesty would also have ordered to be paid, if his
Majesty had wherewith. But the duke of Tyrconnell, who foresaw well
enough, how absolutely necessary it was for the good of his Majesty's
affairs, to have still a reserve of money against any sudden occasion,
proposed, with great prudence, to his Majesty, to spare that little that
he had, and to find means to make the forces subsist yet some time
longer, and to get them cloathed without puting him to any charge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The earl of Melfort inserts here in the French text with his own hand, <HI>And even to get them cloathed by the office<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst Monsieur de Posignian assembled his troops nigh Charlemont,
and Hamilton was ordered by his Majesty to try on his side to make
himself master of the bridge, which would render the communication
easy betwixt him and Monsieur de Pusignian; which the enimies fear∣ing,
they burned the bridge, before we could come at it; but that did
not stop his march, and so great was the courage of himself, his officers,
and the troops he commanded, that most of them passed the river in the
face of the enimie, and made themselves masters of a redoubt on the
other side.</P>
<P>As his Majesty was on the way from Dublin to Charlemont, he re∣ceived
news, that the rebels had quitted Coleraine, when they saw that
Hamilton was master of the passage over the river, and that M. de Pu∣signian
marched to get between them and Derry, and having ruined all
<PB N="182" REF="194"/>
the country between Coleraine and that place, retired to Derry, and into
the country on the other side the river Finne.</P>
<P>His Majesty stayed some days at Ardmagh, a town pillaged by the
enimie, and very inconvenient as well for himself as his train, whilst he
sent Mr. de Rozen and Mr. de Maumont to view the troops at Dungan∣non,
and to give him an account of them. A little after he advanced
to Charlemont, from whence he went two days after to visit the post of
Dungannon, Mr. de Rozen's quarter. He saw the regiment of Cave∣nach
armed half with pikes and half with musquetts, but so bad and so
much out of order, that not one hundred amongst them were in a con∣dition
to be shot in; at which his Majesty was much surprised, believing
them to have been in a much better condition, which made him redouble
his orders for bringing the arms from Corke, Kinsale, and Waterford,
with all speed.</P>
<P>Att the same time the marquis de Pusignian, in pursuance of the
orders which his Majesty had sent from Ardmagh to him and Hamilton
to march to Straban (a passage of the river Finne, at the mouth of which
is situated, ten miles from thence, the city of Derry), march't with his
detachment within a league of Dungannon, and hearing of his Majesty's
being there, came to give him an account of the troops which were with
him, and were in little better condition than those at Dungannon; which
obliged his Majesty to reiterate his orders, and write to the duke of
Tyrconnell and the Sieur de Pointis to send away the arms and ammu∣nition
with all speed.</P>
<P>The King seeing there was no more enimies left on this side the river,
except in Inniskillin, and that every where, upon the approach of his
troops, the rebels had abandoned the villages and little castles, where
they had garrisons, he resolved to go on as far as Omi, being per∣suaded
by all those who knew the country, that Derry will surrender
upon his approach.</P>
<P>He left Charlemont the fourteenth of April, and arrived the same
day at Omi; from whence he found that Hamilton was marched for
Straban, and that Monsieur Pusignian, with half the troops under his
command, of which the most were horse and dragoons, was advanced
to Cladyford, three or four miles above Straban. His majesty was also
informed, that the rebels appeared in great numbers on the other side
<PB N="183" REF="195"/>
the river which obliged him to send Mr. de Rosen, Monsieur de Mau∣mont,
and Monsieur Lery before him, with all the rest of the troops
that were at Omi, except one regiment of foot and one troop of
dragoons, to see if possible they could pass the river at Straban. In the
mean time Hamilton, the duke of Berwick, and Monsieur de Pusignian
having joined their troops about Straban, forced the passage of Clady∣ford
with a handful of men in sight of five or six thousand of the enemy
that were on the other side to oppose them.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Rosen not finding them at Straban on his arrival, and
not being willing to stop there, went himself to view the passage of the
river from Straban to Lissord, and though he had with him only two
troops of horse and one of dragoons, and that the number of the
enemies on the other side appeared, and were effectually ten times the
number, he bravely attempted the passage, and himself and the general
officers leading the way, his troops followed him with that courage
that they all swam the river; and by so bold an action, so frightened
the enimies, that they fled upon the first charge, and pursuing of them
for three or four miles killed many of them.</P>
<P>His Majesty judging by this manner of proceeding of the enimies
that they reserved all their efforts for the defending of Derry, and see∣ing
the necessity there was, to provide things necessary for the siege,
as also to reinforce his army, resolved to return to Dublin, and left the
command of his army in the hands of Monsieur de Rosen, Monsieur
Maumont, Hamilton, the duke of Berwick, Pusignian, and de Lery.</P>
<P>The sixteenth his Majesty came back to Charlemont, where he sent
more troops to reinforce the garrison of Coleraine newly taken, as also
the county of Down, where he was informed that there was a liklihood
of some stirring of rebels. The night of the sixteenth and seventeenth
the King received an express from the army, which let him know that
the general officers had resolved to rest the troops, the 17th and the 18th,
to join all their troops together and march straight to Derry; and
that it was the general opinion, that in the consternation in which the
enimies were since the forcing of the passages of the river, the town
would surrender without any resistance.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="196"/>
The morning of the 17th arrived another express sent by the duke of
Berwick, acquainting his Majesty, that the rebels of Derry had
sent to capitulate with lieutenant general Hamilton, who had sent them
to Monsieur de Rosen as his superior officer, who answered, that he re∣ferred
himself to the King's declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a reference here on the margin of the English copy of the Journal to paper 2d. in Mr. Nairne's collection. It is the King's proclamation of the first of April, referred to above.</NOTE>, and would allow them the
advantage of it if they forthwith surrendered. Upon which the deputies
of the town went back, promising to send their answer by 10 o'clock
the next morning; and that it was the general opinion, the town would
surrender, and, that he was desired by the general officers, to inform
his Majesty, that in their opinion, his presence would be necessary.</P>
<P>The King who would fail in nothing that might contribute to the
good of his affairs, or the reducing of so important a place, resolved to
go thither; and although he foresaw that the voyage could not be only
troublesome, but dangerous, yet he would expose himself thereto, and
shew thereby the regard he had for the opinion of his general officers:
He knew that thereby his return to Dublin was delayed, where the
main of his business lay, but having left all his things there to the ma∣nagement
of the duke of Tyrconnell, whose care and exactness in put∣ting
these orders in execution which he had left them, would, he
doubted it not, supply his absence; and considering, on the other side,
that the resistance of the town would have been imputed to him, if by
avoiding two or three days of fatigue extraordinary, he had neglected any
expedition which might have had the least shadow or probability to re∣duce
it; he delayed no longer to return back again, to appear at the
head of his army, within sight of Derry, to disabuse those unhappy
rebels of the obstinate belief which they had entertained, that his Ma∣jesty
was not in Ireland, but had died at Brest, and, that what was said
to persuade them to the contrary was only to deceive them: therefore
as soon as he had received the duke of Berwick's letter, he set out from
Charlemont, where he left a great part of his train, taking with him
only those who were most necessary of his houshold, as well because of
the scarcity of provisions as the general want of forrage, the ruin of
<PB N="185" REF="197"/>
horses, and other extremities, which were feared. And after a long and
painful day's journey of thirty miles, he arrived that night very late at
Newtown Stewart, where having rested three or four hours in his clothes,
he was on horseback the next morning by break of day, and by
8 o'clock came to Straban, where he received a letter from Monsieur de
Rosen, which let him know, that the rebels at Derry had again sent to
capitulate for the surrender of the place; and that to induce them to
do it the more readily, he was marched with the whole army to shew
himself near the town. The same letter informed him that there were
English ships in the lake, with succours of soldiers and arms for the
town.</P>
<P>The King, who expected to have found the army at Straban, finding
it march towards Derry, and desiring to overtake it with all speed, stopt
not at all, but passing the river on horseback, he overtook the foot,
commanded by Monsieur de Pusignian, two miles from Lifford, and
having viewed them without stopping, went on to join Monsieur de
Rosen, who was gone from Straban four hours before his arrival, with
part of the horse; the rest of the horse and dragoons being sent a day
before to Raphoe, as well to save the provisions which were there in great
abundance, as to consine the enemies and drive them further into the
Peninsula, had orders to rejoin Monsieur de Rosen within sight of Derry,
being commanded by Hamilton and the duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>His Majesty, having joined Monsieur de Rosen, within two miles of
Derry, put himself with him at the head of his troops, and, marching
straight to the town, stopt upon a hill within cannot-shot of the walls.</P>
<P>The place being thus invested by the few horse and dragoons that were
there, Monsieur de Rosen desired his Majesty to hasten the march of the
foot that was behind, which coming up but slowly, Monsieur de Rosen
pressed his Majesty to send back two or three messengers one after ano∣ther
to make them advance with all speed, which his Majesty did.
Mr. de Rosen having posted the foot round the town, from the sea on the
one side, by the wind-mill, to the garden and the sea on the other side,
<HI>the King proposed to send to summon the town, that they might know he
was there; to which Monsieur de Rosen answered, that it was not proper to
<PB N="186" REF="198"/>
do it till all the troops were in battalion in view of the town, and desired the
King to send to hasten Hamilton and the foot; in the mean time, he, Mon∣sieur
de Rosen, advanced with some horse and dragoons, and posted them in
the bottom within less than half cannon-shot of the town, they of Derry not
firing one shot at them. His Majesty, who was resolved to let Monsieur de
Rosen act as he thought best, remained on the heighth, where the horse and
dragoons were first drawn up; seeing from thence the foot marching along the
highway in the bottom, went down to meet them; finding Monsieur de Rosen
resting himself in a large field on the side of a hill out of cannot-shot, though
in full view of the town, proposed to him to draw up the foot there, to give
the rebels a full view of them. But Rosen desired his Majesty to let him post
them as he thought best, to which the King acquiesced and said no more; but
went down and met the foot in the bottom, and let them follow Mr. de Rosen's
orders, and kept himself just out of cannon-shot from the town, and then sent
a trumpet to summon it; so that it was not by the King's orders that they
advanced so far. Monsieur de Rosen, notwithstanding that, made the troops
advance towards the town, and post themselves very near it under the shelter
of the wind mill, and a house near it, and the high enclosures thereabouts,
and detached others along the bottom towards the Butcher's Gate. Whilst
this was a doing, the trumpeter came back to the King, and told him, the
answer he had was, that they would in an hour's time send an answer, but
desired the troops might not advance further. Whether the trumpeter told
this last particular to Monsieur de Rosen as he came back, is not known;
if he did, Monsieur de Rosen took no notice of it, for he did not stop the troops
who were then advancing: the trumpeter spoke French very well, being
either a French or a Dutchman, and was slain since</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The passage in Italicks is in both the French and English copies of the Journal, and yet it is in English in James's hand on the margin of the French copy.—It was James's constant custom to write instantly an account of whatever happened, as appears frequently from his mistaken conjectures about the conduct of others, and from the manner he expresses his hopes of success in his own undertakings.

the day, and there were some soldiers killed. In the mean time, several

<P>His Majesty seeing that he gained nothing upon the minds of these

drew off his troops [<HI>on account of the bad weather,</HI> French copy] to the
quarters nearest the town; there to expect the arrival of the cannon and

troops were harassed, he let them remain in their quarters to rest them∣selves.
That night, the King called together the general officers, when
it was resolved in the council of war that his Majesty held with them,
that the horse should be sent to reduce the rebels, who were said to be
retired into Innishowin, and to drive away all the cattle from thence, and
that a party of foot should go and summon the sort of Killmare,
whilst the rest of them should draw up on a mountain to shew themselves
near Derry. The King, in the mean time, at St. Johnstone gave pro∣tections
to all the protestants, who having laid down their arms, were come
to submit themselves to him, who were in great number.</P>
<P>The twentieth in the morning his Majesty parted from St. Johnstone,
to repass the river and return to Straban, taking along with him the
<PB N="188" REF="200"/>
marquis de Rosen and Monsieur de Lery, leaving the chief command
of the troops and the care of all to Monsieur de Maumont, as first
lieutenant general.</P>
<P>At Straban his Majesty received the deputies of the garrison of Kill∣mare
who came to offer the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marginal note to the French copy in the King's hand, <HI>who sayd they would give up the place if they were sure it was has Majesty was there, and up∣on their return it was given up to Mau∣mont.</HI></NOTE> which he accepted, pardoned them,
and gave them his protection; and the day after their return, the place
was surrendered to his Majesty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the French copy the words are, <HI>and a few days thereafter the place surrendered to Monsieur Hamilton, who had the King's orders to receive it, and to execute all the conditions which his Majesty's clemency had been pleased to grant to the garrison.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King came to Omi, where he received the deputies of
the castle of Dergue, who came, in the name of the whole garrison, to
offer to surrender upon condition to have their goods and lives saved,
and leave to return each man to his home with a protection. His Ma∣jesty
was pleased to grant them these requests; and so that castle, which
strong of itself, and stands upon a narrow pass between Inniskilling
and Derry, and might have hereafter much inconvenienced his Majesty's
army, was reduced without trouble, and received a garrison without
resistance.</P>
<P>From Omi his Majesty came, the 22d, to Charlemont, where he received
an express from Derry, who brought in the news, that those in the
town had made a sally the with three squadrons of horse
and three thousand foot towards Killmare; that they had posted their
horse upon the strand and their foot in the hedges a little farther ad∣vanced,
and to the left, so that it was necessary to pass directly before the
foot to attack their horse. This hindered not Monsieur de Maumont
from putting himself at the head of the advanced guard, consisting of 40
troopers, with Hamilton, the duke of Berwick, Mr. Fitzjames, Mon∣sieur
de Pusignian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French copy in the King's hand.</NOTE> and several volunteers, and to march straight to attack

his foot to the number of 400 men coming up, with 40 dragoons, they
made such an impression upon the enemies, that after an obstinate combat,
<PB N="189" REF="201"/>
they fled, and were pursued by ours to the gates of the town. The
marquis de Maumont was killed at the beginning of this sight, with
a lieut. col. that was near him, and some other officers killed or wounded.
The duke of Berwick had two horses killed under him, and the mar∣quis
de Pusignian one. His Majesty was extreamly afflicted with the lot
of monsieur de Maumont, and commanded his body to be brought to
Dublin. He writ too, at the same time, to Hamilton, positively for∣bidding
the general officers to expose themselves after that manner; it
being a thing altogether contrary to prudence and the good of his
service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marshal de Rosen writes to the King of this affair in the following terms: Je suis fort faché de la pert de tant de braves officiers que V.

<P>The King had already sent a general officer to command the troops,
which were to march into the county of Down, near Antrim and Car∣rickfergus,
to hinder the landing of the English, in case their ships
which had appeared before Derry, and retired the day the King came
before the town, should attempt any thing against the castle of Carrick∣fergus,
a place of much importance, as commanding a convenient port
of that side. But being informed that there were again in that county
some new commotions of the protestants, he sent thither a recruit of one
troop of horse before he left Charlemont, and the next day being the
23d, being come to Newry, and finding the disorders in the said county
of Down increased, he sent one troop more of dragoons, which was all
the force on that side of the country or with his person.</P>
<P>From Newry his Majesty came, the 25th, to Drogheda, and the 26th
to Dublin, where he sound the duke of Tyrconnell not returned from
visiting the troops; the arms not arrived from Cork, Kinsale, or Water∣ford;
and that in the arsenal nothing had been done for preparing of
tools, which obliged him to renew his orders on those two heads.</P>
<P>The news from Scotland being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> that there were many among the
gentry disposed to declare themselves for his Majesty, and that the people
in general were well inclined, his Majesty resolved to send thither the
regiments of Ramsey, Antrim, and O'Neile; and, in the mean time, his
<PB N="190" REF="202"/>
first letters, sent by Mr. Bradey, having been intercepted, and he who
carried them made prisoner, tho' not much of his Majesty's designs
could be thereby discovered, yet as some of the persons to whom the
said letters were directed, being known thereby to be friends to his
Majesty, would be obliged, in their own defence, and for his Majesty's
interest, to take up arms, his Majesty found it convenient to send fresh
letters, with commissions; and, at the same time, he published a decla∣ration
against all the members of the convention, and the adherents of
the prince of Orange, as rebels; and gave full power to all his loyal
subjects to fall upon and destroy them; this being necessary for autho∣rising
the actions of his good servants; since, by the law of the land,
none can take up arms without the King's authority.</P>
<P>A few days after the King's return to Dublin, his Majesty received
the ill news of the death of monsieur de Pusignian, who was wounded
in a sally made by the rebels of Derry, and died two days after. His
Majesty was extremely concerned at it; nor could enough regret the loss
of two such brave men as monsieur de Maumont and him, whose courage,
conduct, and obliging manners had gained the love and esteem of all men.</P>
<P>His Majesty, being still bent upon finding means to put his armies in
a good condition, proposed the having three camps; that Derry being
taken, the troops on that side should camp in the North, toward Scot∣land;
that ten regiments should camp near Dublin, and all the rest of
the army, except the garrisons, betwixt Cork and Kinsale; and that
magazines should be established near each of those camps, from whence
the troops should be furnished with all things necessary.</P>
<P>His Majesty likewise applied himself to the arming of his troops, with
all speed possible, still sending to Derry those that were best armed; he
ordered all the old arms to be mended, two pieces of cannon for bat∣tery,
and one great mortar to be prepared, and tools and other instru∣ments
to be made without delay; and, that this might be done with
more regularity, he gave the commission of master general of the artil∣lery
to the lord viscount Mount Cashell. <HI>He was also resolved to have
sent cannon to Derry by sea; but the English vessels being abroad, that was
impracticable.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are in lord Melfort's hand, in the French copy of the Journal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="203"/>
His Majesty resolving to draw together the horse and dragoons newly
levied, to send them to several places in garrison; and, by that means,
to have more men to send to Derry, more straightly to besiege the same;
having been hitherto, properly speaking, but blocked up; those new
levies, when looked into, were found to be only regiments in name,
and not formed or fit for service. The duke of Tyrconnell, at his
return from visiting the troops, acquainted his Majesty, that he found
amongst the infantry so many good men, that he could not think of
disbanding them; and therefore, that he had kept up, in some regiments,
twenty companies, instead of thirty; and in others, 22 companies,
&amp;c. However, those which were disbanded, committed strange disor∣ders
every where; for the preventing of which, his Majesty erected se∣veral
provost martials in all the provinces of the kingdom, to restrain
and punish the authors of such disorders without delay. He gave or∣ders
also for seizing the goods of absent protestants and rebels, making
use, for that purpose, of the most effectual means which the laws of
the country permitted, and going even beyond that where the occasion
required.</P>
<P>The King, considering the trade was lost, and all commerce broke off
with England, resolved to give out commissions of privateers to all those
who would take them; giving several to those of St. Malo, which he had
done much sooner, if he had not considered, that after beginning to
take the English vessels, it would be no longer easy for him to have any
intelligence from England, the frequency of which was of so much im∣portance
to the good of his affairs.</P>
<P>All traffick being thus broke of, and the transporting of wool, hides,
and other merchandise of the country into England entirely forbidden,
his Majesty found an expedient, by which trade might yet go on with
some security with France; and to that end commanded such merchants
as desired to trade for the advantage of the country and their own interest,
to endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind Spanish and Dutch vessels, to which he would give
passports for the transporting of such goods into France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Before King James left France, a memorial was presented to Lewis XIV. by one of his ministers, recommending a treaty of commerce between France and England, before James returned to his dominions, which might be published along with his declaration, granting a liberty of fice trade to such of his Majesty's subjects as should declare for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D.

It does not appear, that such a treaty was made. But, on the sixteenth of July, James gave the following memorial to D'Avaux, the French ambassador.</P>

But, as that order was only verbal, his Majesty has given it in writing, in order that his most Chris∣tian Majesty's ambassador extraordinary might send a copy of it to France.</P>
<P>His Majesty likewise ordered to allow wool to be exported to France, by all those who would ask permission, which he has never, and never will refuse to any, who will choose to transport wool to France. But the want of vessels has hindered that traffick. The King has entirely forbidden the exportation of any wool into England; and would be very well pleased, that French vessels would come for it, as was promised.</P>
<P>His Majesty having answered to the article proposed concerning wine, that, if his most Christian Majesty demanded the diminution of the duties upon it, he will diminish it as much as his most Christian Majesty will desire. But if he imagines therebyto augment his Majesty's revenue, his Majesty has got that affair examined by his commissioners, in order to know the state of it, that he might send an exact information of it to his most Christian Majesty. In the mean time, he has, as the French ambassador demands it, bought all the wines which the French had imported for sale, without making them pay any duty.</P>

The resistance of Derry had encourged several of the rebels, and
especially those of Inniskillin, to commit insolences. They began to
make excursions into, and destroy the neighbouring country, when his
Majesty sent colonel Sarsfield, with thirty-five companies of foot, four
troops of horse and dragoons, towards Sligo, to confine them within nar∣row
limits, and repress a little their insolence.</P>
<P>About this time happened the defeat of the rebels in the county of
Down, by colonel Baughan, general major of his Majesty's forces [<HI>le Sr.
Bochan, marechal de camp</HI>] who had set upon them with one troop of
horse, another of dragoons, and two regiments of foot; they being be∣twixt
<PB N="193" REF="205"/>
three and four thousand in number, of which six hundred were
killed on the spot, and the rest dispersed. Upon which, that country
being a little more secure from the enemy's attempts, Boughan had or∣ders
to march with his troops to Derry. A few days after, the King
received the welcome news of the arrival of the French fleet, in the
bay of Bantrey, and of the fight they had with the English, who were
beaten and put to flight with as much ignominy, as they had, with inso∣lence,
and disrespect to the law of nations, attacked them. This ar∣rival
of the fleet, which brought a supply of officers, arms, and money;
and which was followed with so glorious a victory, filled the court with
a general satisfaction; and the whole city expressed their joy for it with
bonfires. His Majesty, who had expected this fleet, with the French
officers, a month before, had given orders, when he went to the North,
to all the seaports, intimating how he would have them received at
their arrival. He had kept for the most of them places vacant in the
regiments, though not without difficulty, considering that the officers
who had raised the said regiments, had placed the subalterns, who were,
for the most part, their relations, and had maintained them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive months at
their own expences. His Majesty sent orders to bring the French officers
with all speed from Bantrey to the quarters of the regiments in which they
were to serve; and they were all employed and distributed in different posts,
according to the rank which the ambassador desired: his Majesty making
those who had been captains in France, majors; those who had been
lieutenants, captains; the ensigns, lieutenants; and the cadets, ensigns
or lieutenants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The whole hopes of James resting upon Lewis XIV. that unfortunate prince was reduced into an abject dependence on the count D'Avaux, the French ambassador. The French in general were treated with singular attention; and James paid great respect to the person, and deference to the opinions, of the ambassador in particular: yet he was constantly misrepresented by him to his court. James was very sensible of this, when he wrote as follows to lord Waldegrave, then in France.</P>
<P>“Probably there will be complaints sent to that court against our court martial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol.

<Q>“At a general court martial held, at his Majesties camp near Dundalk, the 24th day of September, 1689.</Q>
<P>An information was preferred, by the judge advocate, against John Wall, a private <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntinel in colonel Nicholas Purcell's regiment of dragoons, for drawing his sword against le Sieur Coverent, against the latter part of the 13th article of war, and against the custom and rule of war,</P>
<P>To this information, the prisoner pleaded Not guilty, and put himself upon his tryal.</P>
<P>His defence was, that le Sieur Coverent was not an officer, which he proved first by his colonel, who said, that lieut, general Hamilton had writt to him, and desired him to take him as a second lieut. <HI>sans façon;</HI> but that he never saw any commission he had. The major of the regiment gave evidence, that he never did guard or party duty, or was received at the head of the regiment, or any troop thereof, as the major heard or saw, as an officer. The prisoner also produced one Fitzpatrick, a cornot in the said regiment, who deposed, that he never took him for an officer in the said regiment; but believed him to be a comrade only of a reformed officer, he saw him very much with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> By all which, it appearing to the court, that he was not a known officer in the regiment, he neither having produced the King's commission, nor done guard or party, duty, the pri∣soner was acquitted, by the whole court, <HI>nomina contradicouts.</HI></P>
<P>“By this, you see the court martial proceeded <HI>secundum allegata et probata.</HI> The judge advocate may be blamed, for that he pressed on the tryal, before witnesses on both sides could be produced.”</P></NOTE>; the engineers were particularly sent for, and dis∣patched
<PB N="194" REF="206"/>
to Derry, where they were extremely necessary. His Majesty
also sent Henry Bond (<HI>le chevalier Bond</HI>) one of his receivers general,
to Bantrey, to bring from thence the arms to Dublin, with all possible
diligence. But the country being full of mountains, and a desert where
they were landed, the distance, and the want of all sorts of carriages,
and not daring to venture them any more at sea, was the cause of their
arriving but very slowly. Whilst they were a-coming, his Majesty dis∣patched
to Derry two cannon, one great mortar, with bombs and ammu∣nition,
and two battalions of the regiment of Eustace, being all that was
armed and fit to be sent; and, for the greater advantage and conve∣niency
of the army, his Majesty established a French munitioner, to
furnish the rations of bread to the soldiers, who was to begin to do the
same, fifteen days after the signing his agreement, to the camp of Derry,
where there was then bread or meal for above a month.</P>
<P>The officers that had hitherto subsisted the regiments at their own
charge, being weary of receiving no pay, the most of them having laid
out all they were worth, and reduced themselves to an impossibility of
doing so any longer, it was resolved in his Majesty's council, that they
<PB N="195" REF="207"/>
should, for the future, be paid regularly; and for that end an exact list
was taken of all the regiments, and all the companies of which they
consisted, with the number of each company: and twelve commissaries
were sent through all the provinces and garrisons, to take an exact muster
of them, they being obliged, before the 28th of May, to give an ac∣count
of such their muster, that his Majesty might, in pursuance thereof,
cause them to be paid for that month: but whilst this was a doing, it
being represented to his Majesty, that the commissaries newly come from
France would, either by themselves, or others appointed by them, make
musters much more exact and true; for this reason, without having
any regard to the review made before, his Majesty having established the
said French commissaries, sent them a second time to make it, in their
way; and, in the mean time, caused money to be given <HI>a bon compt</HI> to
such as had most occasion for it. After which, the pay of officers was
regulated, who had hitherto received no subsistence; having been given
only to the soldiers, at the rate of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> week to the foot,
and of five and forty pence half-penny to the horse, and six and thirty
pence to the dragoons. This being regulated, and the account of the
musters examined, it was resolved to compleat the full payment of the
month of May to the whole army, defaulting what they had received
<HI>a bon compt;</HI> and as his Majesty had not yet established a method for
receiving the money which came out of France, but seeing that the
ambassador was willing to take the trouble of it upon himself, his Ma∣jesty
left it entirely in his hands, requiring none but as he had occasion
for it for his army, to the payment of which he had designed to em∣ploy
it entirely; shewing to the ambassadour, from time to time, the
reasons for which he demanded any; and thereupon the ambassador de∣livered
to his Majesty's receivers general the sums agreed upon, or else
gave orders to monsieur Alexander, treasurer of the money which came
from France, to pay the troops; directing orders to him for that effect
by his secretary, with which his Majesty was so much the better satisfied,
in that the ambassador saw thereby how the said money was employed
to a farthing, and his Majesty's officers were not charged therewith.</P>
<P>But however exact the method was, which was taken for the <HI>acknow∣ledgment
[menagement,</HI> French copy] of that money, his Majesty fore∣saw
very well, that it could not suffice for subsisting, any long time, the
<PB N="196" REF="208"/>
great number of troops which he was obliged to have on foot for the
defence of Ireland; and fearing, with reason, to fall into the greatest
difficulties, if the army should once come to want every thing, and that
he should not have wherewithal to maintain them, he considered of all
the expedients and ways imaginable to prevent so great an evil. His
faithful subjects of Ireland were not in a condition to lend him any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>All the Christian princes, and even the pope himself, only pitied him, but gave him no relief.

money from France not being to come, but with the fleet, the present
necessities of the army, which required a speedy remedy, could not be
relieved time enough. All these reasons made his Majesty resolve to
coin certain pieces of copper, which should go and be received as silver;
and this, after having weighed all the inconveniencies which could hap∣pen
thereby, was found the only expedient capable of serving the army,
in the want to which it was reduced; not having yet received subsistence
for the whole month of May, nor any means left to find in the whole
kingdom wherewith to pay them the half of the month of June; and
it being of the greatest consequence to the good of his Majesty's affairs,
that he should keep some two hundred thousand livres, which yet re∣mained
of the French money, in case his Majesty should have occasion
thereof for England or Scotland, or for intelligence and other things of
that nature; pieces of copper, worth six pence, were therefore begun to
be coined, which is continued every day; nor can enough be made for
the payment of the army, which is very well satisfied with them; and
they pass now in the country without difficulty.</P>
<P>All this time, the parliament was employed in making acts necessary
for the good of the kingdom, for the raising, of money, and for esta∣blishing
liberty of conscience, such as might give no cause of discontent
to his Majesty's subjects in his other kingdoms.</P>
<P>At Derry, the resistance of the rebels continuing, they made several
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allies; in one of which, colonel Ramsay, who commanded the troops
that were furthest advanced, having begun his work too late, the nights
<PB N="197" REF="209"/>
being extremely short, was perceived by those of the town, who fell
upon him, before he could put his work in a condition of defence; so
that, overcome by a great number of the enemies, he was beat back,
with the loss of thirty men, and himself killed fighting bravely. He
was a very good officer, and one whom the King regretted extreamly.</P>
<P>His Majesty seeing that the siege of Derry was likely to continue yet
some time, and that the rebels of Inniskillin grew stronger every day, and
becoming more and more insolent, pillaging and destroying all the neigh∣bouring
country, he sent three regiments of foot, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive troops of horse,
and one of dragoons, under the command of monsieur de Rosen, who had
orders to straiten those of Inniskilling, and to force them further towards
Derry, as he should see occasion; doing therein what he should judge
most proper for his Majesty's service and interest.</P>
<P>The marquis de Rosen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> following his Majesty's orders, marched, the
day of June, from Dublin to Trim, where he remained until
he had received all the arms, that the King could send him for the
arming of his troops, so as to put them in a condition to serve. He
was advanced as far as Cavan, on his way to Inniskilling, when his Ma∣jesty
had the news, that the English appeared in the lake before Derry,
which obliged him to send him orders to march forthwith towards that
place, that being near it, he might be able either to support general
Hamilton, by sending him some part of his troops, or to go and take
the command of the siege himself; that being left to his prudence to
determine as he thought fit, and as the juncture of affairs should
require.</P>
<P>Having received his orders, he marched immediately from Cavan, and
made such haste, that he came time enough to be at the camp at Derry,
before the English had attempted either to land or relieve the town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Rosen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 16.</NOTE> while he was on his march to Derry, wrote several letters to James. Dundagh, 11th June—He complaint of bad roads, the want of arms, and the desertion of his troops. Legaurey, 13th June—He gives the King an account of the intelligence sent to him by Hamilton.—The English fleet had attempted, the preceding day, to enter the lake.—Both Hamilton's forces and his own were few in number, oppressed with fatigue, and wanted arms; whereas the English fleet had brought arms in abundance; and as the rebels in that district amounted to 20,000 men, besides the Inniskilliners, who were already very well armed, a considerable army would soon appear in the North. He had foreseen this long ago, and therefore disapproved of forming the siege of Derry with such a small, ill-armed body of men; and now intreats his Majesty to assemble more troops, and march them towards Derry, according to the plan which he and the French ambas∣sador had laid before him. Dungannon, 15 June—He gives the King extraordinary in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ances of the negligence and want of discipline in the troops.—He excepts only one of∣ficer, and proposes; to break several.—He had entered, that morning, into Charlemont.—The governour, tho' he had been advised the day before of Rosen's coming, had stept in his country-house; all the officers and soldiers, except a few who were in the fields, watching the duke of Berwick and general Hamilton's horses, were in bed.—He complains of the want of tents, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orage, ammunition, and necessaries of every kind.—He was obliged to let loose the horses at night, to pasture in the fields; and had not a surgeon to take care of the sick and wounded.</NOTE>.
<PB N="198" REF="210"/>
In the mean time, his Majesty, not being willing to leave the post of
Belturbatt unguarded, since it was of great consequence for straitening
the rebels in Inniskilling, he sent thither two regiments of foot and one
of dragoons, and two troops of horse, under the command of colonel
Sutherland, brigadier of his forces, whom his Majesty commanded to
keep correspondence with Sarsfield, who was, with three troops of horse,
one of dragoons, and three battalions of foot, within twelve miles of
Inniskilling, on the other side, in a place which covered all the country
towards the South. Sutherland marched straight to Belturbatt, where
he received orders from monsieur de Rosen to march towards Omi, to
secure the troops employed in the siege of Derry on that side. He im∣mediately
obeyed his orders, and went for Omi; leaving only two hun∣dred
and fifty men at Belturbatt. The rebels of Inniskilling, seeing his
march, endeavoured to possess themselves of a narrow pass to hinder it;
but Sutherland having notice, marched all night, and got there before
them; who seeing themselves prevented, and disappointed of their de∣sign,
resolved to return and attack those men he left behind at Beltur∣batt,
which they did, and had not much difficulty to succeed; they
being neither numerous enough, nor having any fortification, which might
enable them to make any great resistance, they were all taken prisoners,
before the succours which his Majesty sent could arrive; tho', in the
moment he heard of colonel Sutherland's march, he sent the regiment of
Bophin, two troops of horse, and two troops of dragoons to that
place.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="211"/>
His Majesty being advertised from several hands, that a great many
horses and a great quantity of arms, belonging to the rebels, were con∣cealed
in Dublin, it was resolved in council, that search should be made
for them; and it was referred to Mr. de Rosen to do it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This justifies the answer which James gave to D'Avaux's memorial. It may be seen among the papers of this year.</NOTE>. This order
was ready to be put in execution, when his Majesty received advice by
a spy, that the rebels had a design to send letters into England, which
the spy himself was to carry. His Majesty thought it necessary to inter∣cept
those letters, and to secure the writers of them; and therefore it
was resolved, by the advice of the French ambassador and the rest of his
council, that the search for arms should be referred for two or three days;
and, in that time, five of the conspirators were apprehended. But there
appearing every day new accomplices of the treason, the examination of
it took up time, and his Majesty being obliged, at that time, to send
Monsieur de Rosen towards Inniskilling, the search of the arms was re∣ferred
to lord Mount Cashell, who having represented the disorder it
would cause, and the little probability there was of finding any arms by
that means, and the duke of Tyrconnel being of the same opinion, his
Majesty let that design alone for this time; resolving, however, to put it
in execution upon the first favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>The camp designed near Dublin was marked out by his Majesty, the
wood and straw for the barracks prepared; but the money falling short,
it was not found expedient to have so many raw soldiers, with officers
equally unexperienced, drawn together, without either money or arms to
give them; and whilst arms were prepared, and ways contrived to find
money, the news from the North quite broke the design of the camp,
and, other measures were taken; Mons. de Rosen being sent one way,
Sutherland another, and three regiments straight to Derry by the way of
Charlemont.</P>
<P>As for the camp nigh Cork, it was not to be thought of, there being
scarce troops left in Munster for the garrisons, all the rest having been
sent to Derry. At this time his Majesty hearing that the rebels began
to rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, taxes in England, found it necessary, to put forth his Declara∣tion
of the 28th of June, by which he forbids the raising or paying
<PB N="200" REF="212"/>
thereof, as also the imprisoning any of his good subjects, declaring such
as should be guilty to be liable to be prosecuted for false imprisonment,
and sued for five pound <HI>per</HI> hour, the penalty inflicted by the act, in
such cases where any is restrained of his liberty against law.</P>
<P>The news from the camp before Derry gave, at this time, very good
hopes of its being soon in the possession of his Majesty's forces. The
short account of the progress of that siege is this:</P>
<P>The great guns and mortars arrived not at the camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Lon∣donderry.</NOTE> till the thirtieth
of May, and till then little was done against the town, except beating
them back when they ventured to sally, and firing with what guns we
had upon them, which, however, did considerable execution.</P>
<P>As soon as the guns and mortars were arrived, and more forces come
up, the siege was carried on more closely, and on the fourth of June, it
being judged necessary to take from the enemy a wind-mill, which they
had secured with several intrenchments, general Bouchan was commanded
to attack it with two battalions of foot, which he did with much bra∣very;
but the rebels having drawn out almost their whole garrison for
the defence of it, and some of the foot not going so heartily on as was
expected, he was obliged to retire, having lost several officers in the
action, and colonel Dorrington and several others being wounded. Some
English ships began now to appear in the loch near the town, and it
was known for certain, that they expected more, on board of which
Kirk was, with three regiments, to try to relieve the town. Upon which
a boom was laid across the river to prevent their coming up; and in
the mean time the general endeavoured to carry on his works, so as to
cut off from the rebels the springs from whence they had their fresh
water.</P>
<P>The English, on the eight of June, sent a small frigate, the Gray∣hound,
with two ketches, to endeavour to get some supply<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the
town; but the frigate was stranded near Killmore, and before she could
get of, had several shots in her from the guns the general had sent for
that purpose, which had certainly beat her to pieces, but that the gun∣ners
were none of the best.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the enemy's whole fleet appeared in the loch; and
came to anchor near Killmore; but the general had so secured the river
<PB N="201" REF="213"/>
with booms, and so posted the forces on each side with cannon, that
they could not attempt coming up the river, without being certainly de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>In this state things continued; the fleet attempting nothing, and his
Majesty's forces carrying on their works against the town, as fast as the
ill weather, and the other inconveniencies, under which they laboured,
would permit them: but the battalions growing very thin, as well by the
soldiers deserting as falling sick, and the English being expected to land,
Mr. de Rosen was ordered to march thither with what forces he had,
which he did; and it being left in his choice to take the care of the
siege upon him, he left it to Hamilton, posting himself so as to hinder
any descent from the fleet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mareschal de Rosen arrived in the camp before Londonderry the 17th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 16.</NOTE> he wrote to the King on the 20th and on the 23d. He gave him an account of some military ope∣rations, and informs him that he allows Hamilton still to command the siege. It is not his fault, nor Hamilton's, that the town delays to surrender, “and as every minute of time is precious to us now, I wish we may not hereafter have reason to regret those we lose here, and that the succours which we expect from your Majesty, and which are absolutely necessary for us, may not arrive too late.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The duke of Berwick was now sent to Donnegall, where the rebels
began to assemble, and he charged them with that courage and success,
that he entirely routed them, taking a great booty of cattle and sheep,
besides fourscore horses and much provisions.</P>
<P>Our works went still but slowly on, until the latter end of the month;
nor could we beat down the enemy's defences, for want of cannon,
which we were forced to employ at the river side in case the fleet should
attempt any thing. But provisions began now to grow so scarce in the
town<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Walker in a letter to Kirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 20.</NOTE> dated the 26th June, mentions the terms of capitulation, which Hamilton offered to the citizens. “If we would surrender the town, and lay down our arms, we should have a free pardon; as many of us as had a mind to transport ourselves should have free liberty, and others might have convoys to their former habita∣tions, and reprisals of their goods; all which we have absolutely refused; but if we have not a speedy supply, and that in a few days, not exceeding six, we must, we fear, accept of the worse that now is offered.” He then represents their distress, and the facility of sending them a supply.</P>
<P>A letter of the same date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 21.</NOTE> signed by three citizens, was sent to Kirk, inclosed in Wal∣ker's. They inform him, that they had fed for some time upon horse-flesh, which be∣gan now to fail them. They complain of sickness, mortality, and desertion; and pray to be relieved by a supply of provisions, and to have a governour if the siege is not raised.</P>
<P>Walker, Baker, and five of the citizens, wrote a letter of the same date, to the Eng∣lish fleet.—They mention the effect which the appearance of the fleet in the lake, and their delaying since that time to relieve the town, has had upon the enemy.—They are afraid of being undermined.—They have not provisions, including horse-flesh, for eight days. In the name of 20,000 distressed protestants, shut up in the city, on account of their loyalty and perseverance, they pray to be supplied with provisions, especially bis∣cuit, cheese, and butter, as they have no fire to dress meat. “We have sallied out and engaged the enemy, three several times, and put them to a dishonourable and shameful retreat, in which two French officers, Pusignian and Maumont, were killed, who were hugely lamented in their camp. Besides, several English and Irish officers of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable note, viz. Brigadier general Ramsay killed last engagement, colonel Nugent, colonel Farrel, captain Watson, an English gentleman, taken prisoner, but since dead of his wounds; brigadier Talbot, formerly called Wicked Will, and nephew to Tyrconnel, taken, and dead and buried this day of his wounds. We were offered five hundred guineas for his ransom, but in regard of your arrival would accept of no terms. We have now the lord viscount Neterville, Sir Garret Aylmer, major Rowcomon, and a great many others of lesser note, prisoners, taken first engagement: and at the last, we have captain Butler, son to the earl of Mount Garret; one of the great Mac Donnells, a captain, and captain Mac Donnagh, and many others too long to name.—We killed and wounded last engagement 800 of their men, many of whom were officers; colonel Dorrington, colonel Gordon, O Neile, lieutenant colonel Eustace, captain Plunket, and many others, were carried of by their horse.—We have got seven pair of colours from the enemy.—If you do not send us relief, we must surrender the garrison within six or seven days.—We understand that the boom is certainly broke, so that you may come up with ease.”</P></NOTE>, that on the 29th they talked of surrendering, and proposed
<PB N="202" REF="214"/>
conditions; but it was thought their aim was, thereby to gain time, still
expecting relief from the fleet. The day before, the King's forces beat
them from two retrenchments, they had made without the gate; but
being there exposed to the continual fire of the enemies from the wall,
they quitted them, some officers being killed and some wounded on that
occasion, and particularly Mons. d'Angleuse.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Rosen, at this time, formed a project, which he had in
part put in execution before he acquainted his Majesty with it; which was
to assemble all the people left in the country from Charlemont and a vast
way round, men, women, and children, and drive them to the walls of the
town, where they should be left to starve, except the town should either
<PB N="203" REF="215"/>
surrender or relieve them. But his Majesty being informed thereof was
sensible this action could not but be every way prejudicial to his service,
since most of these people living at home peaceably, and having either
his particular protections, or relying on that general one of his declara∣tions,
promising safety to all that would return to their houses and live
quiet: this was inevitably to depopulate and ruin the country, and besides
would give his enemies occasion so to represent such a breach of faith in
his other kingdoms, as to dishearten even his best friends. His Majesty
therefore immediately dispatched away couriers to all the places where
Mons. de Rosen had sent orders to assemble these poor people, com∣manding
governours to forbear from doing it at their utmost peril; and
at the same time commanded Mons. de Rosen to desist from any such
attempt. He had, however, before his master's orders could reach him,
assembled above four thousand men, women and children, which he
caused to be driven to the walls; but so little effect had this proceeding
towards persuading the town to surrender, that they fired upon them
from the walls, which Mons. de Rosen perceiving, drew them off and
sent them to their homes again. The enemy endeavoured to send away
in this crowd many of their sick and weak men; which would have
been of great advantage to them in saving their provisions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mareschal de Rosen, in a Letter to King James, dated at the camp before London∣derry, 27th June 1689,—begins to discover the impatience which betrayed him into the barbarity of which James complains in this part of his Journal.</P>

The spy who is our prisoner is a man of good sense, and speaks French perfectly well;—he is likewise of a good family, and possesses, it is said, an income of 500 guineas a year in this country. I have charged the chevalier de Vaudrey to frighten and interrogate him strictly. Your Majesty may see his deposition in the paper inclosed; it is probable he speaks sincerely, and therefore I doubt not but your Majesty, upon reflec∣tion, will give your orders, and take the proper precautions for diverting this new storm, which cannot be done but by sending an immediate reinforcement to your army;—what makes this the more necessary is, that it diminishes daily for want of pay, and that the river has cut off a communication with the division on the other side, which puts it out of our power to sustain the attack of the enemy when they attempt to force the passage. We have fished this morning a drowned man, who floated on the river with bladders about his arms. When he was taken up, we discovered, that he had come out of Derry to swim to the fleet. We found in another bladder, fastened to his neck, the three let∣ters inclosed; by which your Majesty may see in what state the town is now, and of what consequence it is to hinder the enemy from supplying it. I presume in these circum∣stances to take the liberty of representing to your Majesty, that you would have been master of the town long ago, if my advice had been followed; which was, not to grant protections, nor receive any person coming from them, by which means they would the sooner consume their provisions, and be obliged to surrender themselves with the halter about their necks.”</P>

I cannot do any thing that will more effectually secure the possession of this country, and prevent them from penetrating into the heart of the kingdom. These rebels have carried their resistance and obstinacy so far, that they are totally unworthy of your Majesty's clemency, and deserve to be starved to death.

It gave great offence to the people here; and caused many of them believe, that no articles or capitulation, that should be made with us, should ever be performed or kept; when they find and believe, that the said mareschal hath, or pretends to have, a power of command, in the army, above the said lieutenant general, and that he threat∣ens to break the protections already given to the protestants, and use them in manner aforesaid; and that, though we should have sufficient articles, from the said lieutenant general, to save our lives, religion, liberties, and estates, yet on landing of any army from England, to invade Ireland, our articles should be broken, ourselves imprisoned or driven from home, and our goods, chattels, and provisions taken from us, and we forced to starve. That, though we expect favour from his Majesty and the said lieutenant ge∣neral, and others with them; yet we expect no mercy, nor favour, or keeping of condi∣tions with us, from the said mareschal or his countrymen with him; (if he and they shall have power, they having cruel designs) as their countrymen have, against the laws, the liberty, and the religion of all men of our church and persuasion.</P>
<P>“That, on viewing and considering the copy of the commission, granted by the King to the said lieutenant general, to treat with us, we find it bears date the first of May last; since which time, to wit, on the fourteenth of the said month, there sat a parliament in Dublin, by act whereof our lives and estates were forfeited; wherefore we conceive, that the said commission, granted to the said lieutenant general, hath not sufficient autho∣rity for him to treat with us, nor can we, by articles to be made with him, be safe. We, therefore, desire the said lieutenant general will (considering this matter is so dear and near to us, it being all the security we have for our lives, religion, liberty, and estates) not construe this any delay in our treaty; but that he would be pleased to pro∣cure from his Majesty a new fuller commission to treat with us: and that his Majesty may assure us, that we shall have performances of what articles we make with the said lieute∣nant general; so that it may not be in the power of the said mareschal, or the said French∣men with him, or any other, to break what articles shall be made for our advantage, or that we shall be oppressed by them.</P>

Camp before Londonderry, <DATE>5th July 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“I am grieved to see so little attention given to the execution of your Majesty's orders, at a time, when matters are become troublesome and embarrassed. Kirk is always at his post, waiting the arrival of three regiments of cavalry and two of infantry, which are to join him under the command of Charles Count Schomberg. There is no doubt' but this expectation has kept him from making any attempt to throw provisions into Derry, as he might easily have done by hazarding some vessels for that end; yet your troops, which have been lately sent, have arrived almost in the same condition with the former, having been obliged to take such arms as were given them, the greatest part of which are damaged and broken, and accordingly useless, as you have not in all your army a single gun-smith to mend them.</P>
<P>The troops which are here with Hamilton, are in a still worse condition, and the re∣giments entirely lost and ruined; the strongest battalion having but two hundred men, and more than two thirds of them without swords, belts, or bandaliers. The cavalry and dragoons are not the better, that they are the more numerous, as the strongest com∣pany has but twelve or fourteen troopers able to serve. The river which divides your army and prevents a communication, diminishes it considerably. The detachment under the duke of Berwick's command, being more than thirty miles from this place, weakens it entirely, as he cannot leave the post which he has been obliged to take, without allow∣ing the Innskilliners to possess it and to shut us up behind. All this, Sire, together with the embarrassment of the artillery and carriages which are here, with very little means of conveying them in a country, where one is necessarily obliged to go by one road which is very bad, should induce your Majesty to adopt a measure, which is of the ut∣most consequence to the good of your service. It is for this reason, I humbly beseech you to consider this maturely, and to send me instantly your orders about what we should do; as I had already the honour to ask by my two last letters, to which I have yet received no answer.</P>
<P>I cannot comprehend how, the regiment of Walter Butler could be sent away from Dublin without swords and without powder and ball. I am still more surprised, that Bagnel's regiment has been employed to escort the treasure, without giving them a single shot, although, as the officers told, me, they frequently asked, without being able to obtain any; yet, Sire, they both of them marched two days quite close to the garrison of Inniskillin, in danger of falling a prey to them. The garrison of Belturbat is in the same situation; having had, as Sutherland told me, but a little powder, and not a single ball. My heart bleeds, Sire, when I reflect on the continuance of this negligence, since it ap∣pears to me, that no one is in any pain about the ruin of your affairs. I hope, that the return of this express will bring me your Majesty's ultimate orders; and I wish they may arrive in time enough for me to put them properly in execution; having no other object but to show you my zeal and attachment for your service; because I am, with a very profound respect, submission and loyalty,</P>

<HEAD>It appears from another letter from de Rosen of the same date, that he had by that time received from the King an answer to his letter of June 30th, and his Majesty's order, forbidding him to put his project in execution. He presumes to blame James for his clemency, and attempts to justify his own conduct.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received the letter which your Majesty did me the honour to write to me the 3d instant, by which I see that your Majesty is always full of benevolence towards the rebels of this kingdom: their own conviction of this encourages them in insolence, to which they are carried every day, and in the hopes that your Majesty will have com∣passion upon them in the distresses to which, they may be reduced; yet the troops are ruined, and the rebels will receive relief, which will oblige your Majesty to abandon every thing. I imagined that I might have induced them to surrender, by threatening them as I have done, but that has produced no effect. It is true, I have not put my pro∣ject in execution, and that perhaps is the reason why we are not yet further advanced; for I have presented before their gates but a small number of their accomplices, to try if that would make any impressions on them; but they have had the cruelty to fire upon them, and to refuse them every kind of assistance, for which reason I sent them back to their habitations, after having made them comprehend the difference between your Majesty's clemency and the cruel treatment of their own party.</P>
<P>I shall conform to the orders your Majesty has done me the honour to send me, to stay in the army and to destroy the neighbourhood of Londonderry, in case Mr. Hamilton <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all be obliged to raise the siege.”</P>
<P>Rosen continued to represent to James, that the fleet of the enemy encreased, and his Majesty's forces diminished every day; he conveyed to him a letter from the governour of Charlemont, and recommended strongly to take care of that place; in one of his letters dated the 8th of July, he complains to the King of the want of arms, and blames him again for his clemency.</P>
<P>“Upon the death of a captain of dragoons, in Sir—Oneile's regiment, twenty-five dragoons of his company deserted with their horses, and those who remained, refused to serve, alledging, that they were not engaged but to their captain, they were forced to cast lots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 17.</NOTE> and one of them was shot; but the regiment was obliged to borrow arms for that purpose from the lord Mayre's regiment.</P>
<P>“You see, Sire, the condition your troops are in. I leave your Majesty to judge, if an honest man, who has a high sense of honour, can continue to command them without great anxiety, when your enemies are particularly attentive to furnish your rebellious subjects with excellent arms. I doubt not but we shall see them march against us soon, with protections in their pockets and arms in their hands, which happened frequently al∣ready and happens every day.”</P>
<P>The mareschal de Rosen appears to have been a diligent and active officer; but those who served under him were unacquainted with discipline, and either James himself was inattentive to the service, or his orders were never properly executed. On the 10th of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> de Rosen writes to him from the camp before Derry, that he had received a convoy of 80 waggons, five of them were loaded with swords without belts, and the soldiers would be obliged to carry them constantly in their hands; the other waggons were loaded with powder, ball, &amp;c. and 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> in silver; this convoy was sent from Dublin to London∣derry, escorted only by a quarter master and 12 troopers, and they lay three nights in sight of Inniskilling.</P>

In the mean time, the trenches were so filled with water by the flux of
the sea, and rain, that it was impossible to continue in them, nor could
<PB N="205" REF="217"/>
they be drained without great loss of time, the enemy firing continually
from their works, from whence the King's forces could not beat them,
<PB N="206" REF="218"/>
for want of their battering pieces, which were employed at the chain laid
across the river. The town, however, was reduced to great extremities
<PB N="207" REF="219"/>
for want of provisions; for of those who came out and mixt with the
people that were driven to the walls by Mons. de Rosen, several were
<PB N="208" REF="220"/>
known by their wan and lean countenances, and nauseous smell, that
made every one think they had the plague, and others fell down dead

In this state matters were before Derry the 5th of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> and whilst
this was doing his Majesty received frequent advices from Scotland, in∣forming
him of the posture of affairs there. The clans in the Highlands
were generally firm to his Majesty's interest, and were in arms, and ready
to receive his orders. The viscount of Dundee had surprised one troop
of the enemy at St. Johnstown, seized their arms and horses, and stripped
<PB N="211" REF="223"/>
the men: he marched from thence with a good body of men, and pur∣sued
Mackay 3 or 4 days; but not being able to overtake him, returned
to the Highlands, and so dismissed his men as to have them ready upon
a very short warning.</P>
<P>The chief of the family of the Mac Leans had a considerably body
of men together, and had on two or three occasions beat the enemy;
however, Edinburgh Castle was surrendered by the duke of Gordon
upon conditions, though it does not appear that he was reduced to any
extremity, but might have held out much longer, having provisions and
every thing else necessary to have held out for four months<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the accounts which James received from Scotland, and to which frequent refe∣rences are made in this journal, are too long to be comprehended in notes, they are placed in a series at the end of the papers of this year.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The day before another messenger endeavouring to get into the city,

<P>That he had left lord Dundee in a retreat, at a place called Bog of Geith, in a strong Country of the North, with six thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry. That he had had a small rencounter with Mackay, in which he received a check, being himself slightly wounded. That Mackay was still not far from him, with three thousand infantry.

<P>That Blantyre's and Glencairn's regiments of infantry and my lord Eglington's regiment of cavalry, with a regiment of dragoons, had gone from Dumbarton to the shire of Argyle; Burgenny's regiment of infantry remaining at Glasgow.</P>
<P>That there were two regiments on board the fleet; Kirke's and, as he believed, Cuningham's, commanded now by Stuart. That there were also great quantities of arms, ammunition and provisions; the vessels come from Scotland, having a great deal of meal; and those from England, quantities of cheese, pork, and salt-beef.</P>
<P>That of the two thousand men expected from England, there were two regiments of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avalry. That Schomberg was to have the chief command.

The 10th of July, the Scotch officers went on board with a regiment
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rish, in the 3 frigates, commanded by Monsieur du Quesne, at Car∣rickfergus,
and the same day, meeting with two Scotch privateers, be∣longing
to Galloway, one of 14 and the other of 20 guns, with betwixt
80 and 100 men on board each, the fight continued about an hour very
obstinate, and some of our Scotch officers were killed; but the two
captains of the privateers, Hamilton and Brown, being killed, Monsieur
de Quesne became master of them, and putting some of his equipage on
board, sent them to Dublin and pursued his course for Scotland, where
he safely landed the forces he had on board; which succour, however
<PB N="215" REF="227"/>
small, will encourage my lord Dundee till more can be sent. The
French officer who commanded the two prizes, made another in his
way to Dublin; which was a small bark employed to carry letters
from Schomberg to Kirk and several others; by which was discovered
the prince of Orange's design to send hither 12,000 men, commanded
by count Solmes. But effectual order will be taken, that this descent
shall not find us unprovided; for Derry is vigorously attacked, and Kirk
seeing that he could not get any succour into the place, has landed in a
little island about three miles off, where he is intrenched, in expectation
of succours from England. In the mean time, the rebels at Inniskillin
are straitened on all sides, and the duke of Berwick, in a little ren∣counter
he had lately with them, has cut two companies of foot in pieces,
and taken several prisoners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following letters relate to the operations of this period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 38.</NOTE></P>
<P>Derry, 15th July.—General Hamilton gives the earl of Melfort an account, “That a Whitehaven man had two of the prince of Orange's packets on board, directed, as he was informed, to Kirke: that colonel Maxwell had writ to him of a great power em∣barked at Liverpool and Chester.”</P>
<P>July 16th.–“That the ships that were in the loch were all gone, and four of those of Inch also: but that the men that were put ashore still remained there.”</P>
<P>July 17th.—Hamilton wrote to the King, “That the whole fleet, which was thought to have been failed towards Scotland or England, was at anchor beyond Innishaven point: that the duke of Berwick having had notice, that about four hundred of the enemy were at Ramullin, was designed to march thither, in the beginning of the night, and to fall on them by break of day; his grace's camp being then within ten miles of Ramullin: that twenty of Clancarty's men, and the major, had attempted to lodge themselves in a house, within twenty yards of our advance; but in vain, the major having been wounded in the arm, and about twelve of the soldiers killed or wounded.”</P>
<P>James, by this time, had particular intelligence of the preparations made in England for a descent in some part of Ireland. He informs de Rosen, in a letter, dated at Dublin, the 17th of July, that vessels for transporting cavalry were ready at Whitehaven, Chester, and Liverpool; that ladders and other implements for a siege were put on board ships in London; and that the count de Solmes was to command the expedition. He therefore thought it was necessary to execute the design against Inniskillin without delay, which he imagined might have been done before, if Rosen had recalled the duke of Ber∣wick. He desires Rosen to press the siege of Derry, and to inform him in what time he thought it could be taken.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>On the 20th, he writes to his Majesty, “That, when the trench was opened, they had fourteen battalions, consisting, at most, in six thousand men: that the besieged were then, by what they could learn, five thousand strong: that as the town's forces were di∣minished by sickness and mortality, so his Majesty's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces were grown weaker, by the same reasons. Besides, by men killed, wounded, and desertions, that his Majesty's forces now about Derry, did not, by a great deal, amount to the number of five thousand men: that the most part of the fleet was betwixt Ramullan and the isle of Inch: that their de∣sign was to raise as many men as they could, and to join with the Inniskillin people: that the mareshal kept his bed, and was much out of humour; and was resolved to meddle with nothing: that, if special care was not taken, they would shortly want pro∣vision for their men; every thing being extremely bare about Derry.”</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The 22d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 39.</NOTE> lieut. general Hamilton having received his Majesty's or∣ders
for pressing the siege of Derry, held thereupon a council of war,
where the opinions of all the general officers did unanimously conclude,
that it was impossible to take the town, but by famine; which opinions

were signed by the respective officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The deposition of the general officers, anent the siege of Derry, July 20th, received 22d,

<P>“The chevalier de Carny is of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 36.</NOTE> that the place cannot be taken by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rce, with so small a number of troops and cannon as are before it; because they are entirely di∣minished by sickness; and because, he believes, the besieged are, at least, two thousand. Signed, Charles Carny.”</P>
<P>“My opinion is, since our army is reduced by sickness and fatigues and desertion, not to the number of three thousand men able for service; judge that number's not in a condition to force the town in a certain time; but believe, that these of the town are far inferior to our number. Signed by John Wauchop.”</P>
<P>“By what I have observed, since the trenches were opened, I am of opinion it will be impossible for us, in the condition we are in, to force the town that way; and that the necessities of the besieged will sooner reduce them than we can, by beginning another attack. Signed by Dom. Sheldon.”</P>
<P>“My opinion is, that we cannot force the town speedily, by reason of the want of cannon; and that the infantry is fallen very weak, by sickness and desertion; but to keep the blockade as long as his Majesty's service will permit. Signed, Tho. Buchan.”</P>
<P>“My opinion, on the present situation of affairs, is, that, considering the forces which are before Derry, and those which are in the place, it is impossible to take it by force at all; much less to take it in a limited time. It might be reduced by famine, if we had time and a sufficient number of troops to hinder the ships from throwing in pro∣visions; and at the same time to hinder, by a body of troops on the river Fin, the junction of the forces which Kirke hath landed in the isle of Inch, with those who have joined the rebels of Inniskillin, to whom it will be necessary to oppose a body of troops at Trelick; and all these projects will be ineffectual, if care is not taken that provisions shall not fail. Signed, Girardin.”</P>
<P>“It is my opinion, that it is impossible to take the town of Derry by storm, with the little number of foot that is here, or without a considerable number of battering guns, much less to guess when it shall be taken: and I do certainly believe, that unless they want provisions, they will never surrender. Berwick.”</P>
<P>“As I have not changed the opinion of which I have always been, it is not necessary now to commit it to writing. The most essential thing to be done is, to hinder the junction of the Inniskilliners with the troops from the ships which are in the isle of Inch and at Ramullin; where they assemble as many as they can of the country people. Their fleet, which left Loch Foyle, being now between Ramullin and Inch, the corps which the duke of Berwick commands for that purpose, cannot be more advantageously posted than towards Castle Fin, where he may have the best information of the motions of the enemy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and take the most proper measures to oppose them. Care should be taken that the troops shall not want provisions, a thing that is most to be dreaded, and the danger of aban∣doning Belturbat entirely, in case (Anthony) Hamilton's corps advances towards Trelick, must be considered. Richard Hamilton.”</P>
<P>Upon receiving these opinions of his general officers, James sent the following order to general Hamilton.</P>
<Q>King James's order to lieutenant general Hamilton, to turn the siege of Londonderry into a blockade.</Q>
<P>“Trusty and well beloved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 37.</NOTE> we greet you well. Whereas we understand, by your letters of the 20th instant, that it is the opinion of all the general officers, that it is impossible to take the town of Derry, but by famine, we have thought fit not to wait major Nugent's return, but to send you our orders concerning the same. Seeing that Derry cannot be taken by force, with such a small number of men as it is besieged by, our will and plea∣sure is, that, so soon as you receive this, you prepare for raising the siege, and then actually raise it, unless you be of opinion, that, in continuing the blockade, the town will be forced to surrender for want of provision, which, in all appearance, must happen very shortly; since, by their last proposals, they offered to surrender the twenty-sixth of this month; which, if you believe to be so, you are to continue the blockade, so long as you shall think is for the good of our service.</P>
<P>You are, before your departure from before Derry, to cause blow up the fort of Col∣more, that it may not stand in our way another time.</P>
<P>You will see what our intentions are, by a duplicate of our letter to the marquis de Rosen, which we have ordered to be sent to you.</P>
<P>Seeing that engineers, in appearance, will be but of small use to you now, you are to order the engineer Burton to go to Charlemont; and to take an exact plan of that place and adjacent grounds, which, with all convenient speed, he is to bring to us, that we may give our farther orders thereupon.</P>
<P>We doubt not, but you will do what may be best for our service in all things; and so we bid you heartily farewel.</P>

<P>The King's letter to de Rosen, of which he inclosed a copy to Hamilton, contains further instructions to distress the enemy, by laying waste the country about Derry and Inishowen, in case he should be obliged to abandon it; and to reinsorce the duke of Ber∣wick, that he might attack the Inniskilliners, according to the plan which James had already formed.</P></NOTE>, and sent to the King; upon
which, his Majesty, by advice of his council, did send new orders to
<PB N="218" REF="230"/>
the marshal de Rosen and Hamilton, commanding them to quit the siege,
and only to continue the blockade, as long as they should think it fit for
his service, or that they saw any appearance of the town's surrendering by
<PB N="219" REF="231"/>
famine, leaving that to their prudence; but ordering, in the mean time,
to destroy the country, to blow up the fort of Colmore, and dispose all
things for retiring, in the manner that might be most prejudicial to the
enemy.</P>
<P>The 25th, the duke of Berwick was to march towards the inniskillin
rebels; where, in all probability, he was to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll on them successfully:
and, as the design was laid to join with Sarsfield, he might have cer∣tainly
done good service, if he had not been countermanded by mon∣sieur
de Rosen; who, altering his mind, did not think fit to have the
duke's party so far from him. In the mean time, the blockade conti∣nuing,
Derry was certainly starving, and the most part of the inhabitants
reduced to eat starch. Seven ships appeared, as resolved to enter in to
succour the town; upon which, the guns that were brought to batter
the town, were sent back to the chain, to defend the passage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On the twenty-fifth of July, general Hamilton writes to the King, “That the mareschal de Rosen would neither meddle with the blockade or raising the siege; saying, he always declared against the besieging of the town, and that his advice had been slighted: that, in a sally the besieged made that morning, nine of theirs were left behind, be∣sides near thirty killed; their pockets found with starch in them, as a sign of their great wants; and that a dying man of their number declared, that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed on nothing else for five days: that they expected provision every moment: that seven ships were come into the loch, whereof three near Colmore are resolved to sink or get to the town by the first fair wind: that the mareschal de Rosen was resolved to march to Charlemont; and, in his way, to ruin all the country behind him, and to make an attempt on Donnegal, Ballishannon, and Inniskillin, which he would do, by reinforcing the duke of Berwick's party: that his Majesty will find, that a recruit of officers will be as useful as that of soldiers: that, when the sally was made, at eight that morning, Fitzgerald and Dick Butler's regiments we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the trenches: that Fitzgerald's regiment was beat out: that Butler's kept their post, until the lieutenant general's brother came up, with what men he could get ready; and so beat back the enemy: that the town's men cannot stand be∣fore the King's men in the field.”</P>
<P>On the same day, he writes to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Melfort, “That the mareschal de Rosen had altered his mind of condescending to the duke of Berwick's marching against the rebels of Inniskillin; not thinking it safe to have the duke so far from him: that recruits of officers, as well as soldiers, were of great importance: that there was not one captain in the battalion of guards, being all sick; as well as lieutenant colonel Burke's: that most part of the besieged were reduced to eat starch: that seven ships, come to the loch, were resolved to venture in; but that the wind was contrary: and that the guns were sent back to the chain.”</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="232"/>
The 28th, a spy out of Derry gave account the rebels had killed all
their dogs, horses, and cows; and that it was the last provision they
expected; and all their hopes were in the four ships that were before
Colmore. The serjeants and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers of Derry sent out a signed paper
to major general Buchan, offering to surrender the town to lieutenant
general Hamilton, the morrow after, if they could but obtain some fa∣vourable
conditions for themselves. But the morrow after, being the
29th, the wind became fair for the ships; whereof two ventured up to
the chain, broke through it, and succoured the town with provisions,
which put an end to all hopes of taking it any more by famine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The 30th of July, major general Buchan writes: “There are two ships got into the town; the smallest of which is loaden with meal from Scotland; the bigger, with biscuit, cheese, pork, and pease. The captain of the first that came was shot dead, his lieutenant wounded, and five of his men killed, and several wounded. I think I can do the King more service in Scotland than here.”</NOTE>. So,
considering the threatened invasion from England, the necessity of rest∣ing
and recruiting the troops, and drawing a considerable body near
Dublin, for the security of his Majesty's person, from that day forth,
the resolution of raising the blockade was fully determined, and all pre∣parations
made for the same; the cannon, ammunition, and the sick sent
away; parties sent to destroy the country, and officers to recruit their
regiments. And whilst all this was doing at Derry, my lord Mount∣Cashell,
who had been sent down to Inniskillin the 20th, having assembled
his troops at Belturbat, to the number of 3600 men, the 27th; the
30th he made an attempt upon Crumm-castle. The party commanded,
did immediately possess themselves of the first intrenchments; but the
soldiers, contrary to the general's express commands not to go farther,
were so animated with their first good success, that they went impru∣dently
on to the very castle walls, and exposed themselves; so that
severals were killed, and a great many wounded. Mount-Cashell, hear∣ing
that there were 4000 men come out of Inniskillin, of design to
relieve Crumm, retired himself to Newton, two miles from thence, to
put himself in a condition, either to receive the enemy, if they came,
or to renew, vigorously, the attack of the castle. But the morrow after,
being the 31st of July, as O'Brian's regiment of dragoons was marching
in the morning to Lisneskeny, they discovered a party of the enemy,
<PB N="221" REF="233"/>
who immediately retired, as soon as they were pushed, till they came
to a place where two foot companies and five troops of horse were drawn
up, which put the dragoons into such a consternation, that, notwith∣standing
all major general Hamilton could say or do, to give them good
example, they all ran away most basely: lord Mount-Cashell marching up
with the horse put a stop to the pursuit. This, with the report that the
whole force of the rebels were coming to fall upon Mount-Cashell, obliged
him to retire towards Belturbat to be upon his guard; but he was pre∣vented
by the rebels, who following the good fortune they had in the
morning, came up to him at Newton, where he did all a brave man
could do, but was so ill seconded by the soldiers, all wearied and dis∣couraged
by the morning's defeat, and even by most of the officers, who
fled with the horse and dragoons, without so much as waiting the first
fire, that the whole army was routed, and some of the officers that did
their duty killed, among whom was the Sir Stephen Martin; others wound∣ed,
amongst whom was the lord Abercorn; and others very narrowly
escaped with the loss of their horses and all their baggage; amongst
whom were as volunteers my lord Drummond and Mr. Ployden, who be∣haved
themselves most bravely; and my lord Mount-Cashell himself, who
was wounded and taken prisoner, forsaken by all his regiment, which
was with the most part of the foot cut off while they were flying.</P>
<P>A council of war was held to judge of the officers and others behaviour
in this engagement and punish such as miscarried. In the mean time, his
Majesty was giving out commissions for levying of new forces, and
making all preparations for the defence of the kingdom in case of in∣vasion.
A camp is ordered and actually begun hard by Dublin; all the
general officers are arrived from Derry; dissaffected persons are seized
every where up and down the country, and nothing is neglected for the
security of his Majesty's person and the defence of this kingdom against the
invasion it is daily threatened with, and by reason whereof, and of the
late misfortune happened to my lord Mount-Cashell, the succours from
France are here so impatiently waited for, and so absolutely necessary.</P>

He apprehends that this journal is not much, if at all known, as he has not met with it in any printed collection whatsoever.</P>
<Q>“A journal of the most remarkable occurrences that happened between his Majesty's army, and the forces under the command of Mareschal de Schomberg, in Ireland, from the 12th of August to the 23d of October 1689. Faithfully collected, by James Nihell, Esq; under∣secretary to the right honourable the earl of Melfort, his Majesty's prime secretary of state.</Q>
<P>On the 12th of August, 1689, a numerous fleet appeared off the coast of Donaghadie, in the county of Downe; out of which 200 men made, that night, a descent on the land, and entrenched themselves.</P>
<P>On the 13th, Mareschal de Schomberg, who commanded the forces on board, de∣barking his men, horses, and train of artillery, set foot on shore without opposition.</P>
<P>On the 14th, he ordered the 200 men that first landed, to march to Belfast; and the next day he followed in person with the gross of the army, and refreshed himself there till the 19th.</P>
<P>On the 19th, he invests Carrigfergus; and having summoned the garrison to surren∣der in vain, though with offers of fair and honourable conditions, he drew out his lines, and the next day, played upon the town with four batteries of cannon and three mortar∣pieces, besides all the guns of the navy, to which the place stood exposed, within dis∣tance, while he made his approaches by land, where he found the works or walls most accessible. Yet, though he with bombs (of which he threw a thousand) had laid all the buildings in ashes; and, though the garrison could not reasonably hope for any succour, they kept it nine days, and were even then reduced to one barrel of powder, made soldier-like terms, marching out with their arms, colours flying, ball in mouth, and other ceremonies of war, to be attended by convoy, until they were within three miles of the Newry. Yet the articles (though signed by Schomberg himself) were nevertheless bar∣barously violated by the soldiers; who, without regard to age, sex, or quality, disarmed and stript the towns people, forcing even women to run the gauntlet stark naked.</P>
<P>On the 26th of August, the King came from Dublin to Tredath, attended with 200 of his guards and gentlemen volunteers on horseback, and found there no more than seven regiments of foot and some few troops of horse, a strong party of the cavalry being com∣manded out as far as the Newry, under the duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>The 6th of September, his Grace, to hinder the enemy's advancement upon him and render his march to the Newry incommodious and difficult, broke up all the causeways and other defiles through which he must pass; and to make all secure, burnt even the town, and retired to Dundalk, where he found Monsieur d'Esco, with two companies of foot and a troop of horse sent out from the army to bring up his rear; for their forces united were very insufficient to make head against the enemy, who then pressed their march. So they all faced about and drew off together.</P>
<P>The King, now in Tredath, was informed, by some Irish and one French deserter, that Schomberg's troops were very much diseased and already in want of provisions.</P>
<P>The 13th, all his Majesty's forces were come down to the camp near Tredath.</P>
<P>On the 14th, the King marched the army from Tredath to Athardie, about eight Irish miles, and there met with intelligence, that about twelve sail of the enemy's fleet were the day before up with the Skerries and fired many guns, which drew the militia and such numbers down to the shore, that they durst not venture upon it, but bore away large to the southward, where they ply'd too and again, betwixt Hoath and Bullock, with a de∣sign, as it is thought, to animate the malignant party (if any such were in Dublin) to rise. But matters were so well secured there, by the conduct and vigilance of colonel Symon Lutterell, the governor, that, disappointed of all expectations, they vainly stood off to sea and were soon out of sight.</P>
<P>On the 16th, his Majesty, on the first appearance of day, marched the horse and dra∣goons from Athardie to Allardston, near Assyn-Bridge, about three miles short of Dundalk, of which he possessed himself about twelve. By midnight following, his foot guards came up to him; and the body of infantry by noon next day. Having fortified the bridge, he placed the guards on the further side of the river, and sent parties out to discover the enemy. Towards the evening six troops of the cavalry made up to a small advanced party of 50 horse and some few volunteers that attended his Majesty's army, who, never∣theless, receiving the enemy's fire, immediately charged and put them to slight.</P>
<P>On the 18th, the whole camp was formed with as much regularity and advantage a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ground would admit of. The King, in his person, having traversed it all over after viewing the entrenchments and posture of the enemy.</P>
<P>On the 19th, several persons were taken, and some deserters <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame with intelligence, that Schomberg had set all hands to work to secure himself, by fortifying Dundalk, and seemed rather to prepare against a siege than a battle.</P>
<P>On the 20th, the King drew out his army; and, marching in the head of the first and second line within less than cannon-shot of the enemy, he immediately put them in order of battle (according to a method agreed on) with wonderful expedition and silence. The lines extended themselves from South-east to North-west, along a ridge of hillocks that front the town. The second line shewed itself between the intervals of the first. In this posture, they stood for three hours. The soldiers, transported with courage by the presence and great example of their King at the head of them, could not forbear, by shouting and other demonstrations of joy, to dare and challenge the invaders; who, ne∣vertheless, could not be provoked nor invited by any means out of their fortifications: and, therefore, the King, disappointed in his hopes of deciding the war by a battle, com∣manded his troops, just under the Mareschal's view, to march easily back to their camp again: His Majesty himself remaining in the rear of all his army, until he saw the last soldier drawn off. Seven prisoners were that night brought in by a detached party of dragoons from a village called Haggardstoun, on the sea-side. The captains O'Neal and Murphy likewise with 50 foot surprizing a party of 80 dragoons behind a mountain that covered the enemy, killed two on the place (among whom some French Hugonots re∣fused quarter), took six prisoners, the rest escaping by flight.</P>
<P>On the 21st, the King gave orders for the fortifying Athardie with ditches, ramparts, and other necessary works. A retrenchment was likewise cast up before the left wing of the first line.</P>
<P>On the 24th, the King viewed the country on all sides, resolving, when he found it necessary or convenient to dislodge from the ground he then stood incamped on, and to pitch his tents on the edges of small hillocks that arise between the rivers of Mapastoun and Athardie, and therefore gave general orders for preserving the forrage in all parts within command of his army. [These are the operations of the 29th day in the manu∣scrpt of the journal.]</P>
<P>On the 26th, a commanded party of horse dragoons with 35 companies of grenadeers, set fire to all the forrage and corn on the other side of the Lurgan river, for three miles along the sea coast, and under the enemy's nose, who, nevertheless, made a faint fally, but were easily forced back to their trenches again.</P>
<P>On the 28th, towards the evening, the discharge of the enemy's artillery three times, pursued with as many vollies of small shot and huzzas, amused the King's camp for some while, until disabused next day by a deserter, who said, all that noise was the celebration of a great victory obtained by those of Inniskillin against the King's party at Sligo; but this mighty action, upon better intelligence, proved only a skirmish between a small band of that county militia and a troop of rebels, wherein three of the loyalists fell, and that number twice told of the enemy.</P>
<P>On the 30th, an ensign from Mac Carty More's regiment returned to his Majesty's camp with advice, that 3 ships, wherein were embarked colonel Villiers' troop of horse and men, were newly cast away: that 500 French officers and soldiers, suspected to be Catholicks and well-wishers to his Majesty's cause, were sent a ship-board, their place of confinement: that seven Frenchmen and a captain were hanged upon suspicion of affect∣ing the King's party: that fourscore a day at the least were sent from the enemy's camp to the hospital; and that all their horses were turned out to grass for want of hay and other necessary forrage.</P>
<P>On the 31st, two regiments of foot were commanded to Sligo, and the parts on all sides adjacent to it, to preserve the inhabitants under his Majesty's obedience, and check the excursions from Inniskillin.</P>
<P>On the 2d of October, a party of 150 foot were detached, under the command of lieu∣tenant colonel Stapylton and captain Hugh Macnamara, to relieve and bring off the 500 French that Schomberg had caused to be stript and carried by water to Carlingford, suspecting they had a design of changing their party. The march was difficult and ha∣zardous, for they could not avoid the English camp but by a detour of at least 30 miles, and that through almost impassable mountains; nevertheless they marched cheerfully over them to a vale within six miles of Carlingford, where making a halt, to fix their arms and cover their priming against a shower of rain that hung over their heads, a party of the enemy came upon them; and being demanded, whom they were for, they answered, they were for King William; so are we, said Stapylton, with purpose of taking his opportu∣nity of surprising them: but the zealous soldiers, ignorant of his meaning, declared loudly, they were for King James, and made good their words with a volley. Fourteen they killed on the spot, seized all their arms, and made eight prisoners, without receiv∣ing a wound. [<HI>The MS. copy of the Journal concludes here.</HI>]</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, forage becoming now scarce, the King thought sit to return to Athardie; and on the 6th, very betimes in the morning, the army was in a readiness to march. But the smoke of the soldiers huts, set on fire by command, made their first set∣ting out a little incommodious and difficult, but that was soon over, for when they saw clear, they easily fell into their ranks and marched in great order; the right wing of the horse and dragoons, with two brigades of foot, the cannon, and all the King's equipage, by Mapastoun Bridge; the left wing, with the reserve of the foot, and all the baggage of the army, by the road that led to the Bridge of Tallanstown; and that afternoon the foot encamped in two lines near Athardie, having the river and a long morass before them. The horse and dragoons, for convenience of sorrage, and shelter, were sent to three vil∣lages lying on the right of the infantry; and the brigade of foot, that made the <HI>corps de reserve,</HI> to another village beyond them. But the next day, his Majesty visiting that part of the army, thought the <HI>corps de reserve</HI> (as indeed it was) too far advanced, and there∣fore gave orders that they should return to the village where the duke of Tyrconnel's regiment lay; and sent the lord Dongan's dragoons, with three other battalions of foot from the camp, to reinforce that post. He then ordered a breastwork to be made at the end of a narrow causeway that passes through the bog, and a guard of 60 foot to defend it. Colonel Purcell's and Sir James Cotter's dragoons were posted on the left at Dowdstoun and Peppardstoun, to secure the two bridges. The earl of Abercorn's regiment of horse stood encamped at a small village between the two lines. But the horses of that and colonel John Parker's regiment being very much harassed, and no danger appearing from the enemy, his Majesty thought fit to send them to their winter quarters.</P>
<P>The King having reason to believe that mareschal Schomberg would not easily quit Dun∣dalk, called a council of war, and proposed the fortifying of Athardie, to hinder his ad∣vance, and to facilitate the carrying on of the war earlier in the spring. Some of the chief officers were of opinion against it; yet the duke of Tyrconnel, who chiefly seconded the King's resolution of marching from Tredath with his army, in order to engage the enemy, to which (under God) we owe all the success we have met with, joining in opi∣nion with his Majesty, the work was set on foot, and that place made so strong a frontier before the King left it, that though Schomberg stayed for almost ten days after at Dun∣dalk, where he lost by distemper above 10,000 men, yet made no attempt upon the party left at Athardie under the command of major general Boiselot, but was glad to make a safe retreat with the surviving part of his army, leaving many sick behind, and a number of dead bodies unburied.</P></NOTE>.</P>

for it the best he could; though the ford at Old-bridge was not
to be maintained.</P>
<P>June 30th. The enemy appeared on the other side the river, over-against
the King's army, where the river was fordable almost every where. The
King made some of his cannon advance; which so galled the right wing,
that they retired out of sight, behind the eminence. It was there the
prince of Orange was touched, on the shoulder, by one of the first two
shots, which fetched off the skin, but did no further prejudice.</P>
<P>July 1st. The enemy were heard to beat the generale before day. As
soon as the sun was up, their right wing marched toward Stane. The
King ordered his left to march likewise; and sent off his baggage toward
Dublin, with all the cannon but six. Sir Neal O'Neal's dragoons did
their part well. They disputed the passage almost an hour, till their
cannon came up; and then retired in good order. The enemy passed.
They stretched their line to the right, as if they designed to take the
flank, or to get between us and Dublin, which M. de Lausun seeing,
marched with the left to keep up with them, and observe their motions.
The King went to the right, to hasten up the troops to follow de Lau∣sun,
<PB N="227" REF="241"/>
believing the main body of the enemy was following their right,
which had passed the Boyne at Stane. He found the duke of Tyrcon∣nel,
with the horse and dragoons of the right and the two first brigades
of the first line, drawn up before Old-bridge; from which post he did not
think fit to draw them, the cannon and baggage being not far enough
advanced on their way to Dublin. The red of the foot, however,
marched, by their flank, after de Lausun. The King himself took the
reserve, consisting of Purcell and Brown's foot, with which he marched
till he came up with the rear of the foot, that followed de Lausun. He
found de Lausun and the enemy's right drawn up in battle order within
half cannon shot, facing each other. The King did not think fit to
charge just then, being in expectation of the troops he left at Old-bridge.
But while he was discoursing this matter with de Lausun, an aid-de-camp
came to give the King an account that the enemy had forced the pass at
Old-bridge, and that the right wing was beaten. The King, whispering
in Lausun's ear, told him, there was now nothing to be done, but to
charge the enemy, forthwith, before his troops knew what had happened
on the right, and, by that means, to try if they could recover the day.
He placed M. Haguette at the head of the French foot. He ordered
the dragoons to light, and placed them in the intervals between, and or∣dered
Lausun to lead on. But as they were beginning to move, Sarse∣field
and Maxwell, who had been to view the ground between the two
armies, said, it was impossible for the horse to charge the enemy by rea∣son
of two double ditches with high banks, and a little brook betwixt
them, that run along the small valley which divided the armies, and at
the same time, the enemy's dragoons got a horse-back, and their whole
line began to march, by their flank, to the right, and we soon lost sight
of their van, by a village that interposed; only by a dust that rose be∣hind
it, they seemed to endeavour to gain the Dublin road; upon which
the King thought fit to march also by the left to the Dublin road too, to
pass the small brook at Duleek which was impracticable higher above,
by reason of a bog. The King was no sooner on his march, but the
right wing's being beat was no longer a mystery; for several of the scat∣tered
and wounded horsemen got in amongst them, before they reached
Duleek. Whereupon M. de Lausun advised the King, to take his own
regiment of horse, which had the van of that wing, and some dragoons,
<PB N="228" REF="242"/>
and to make the best of his way to Dublin; for fear the enemy, who
were so strong in horse and dragoons, should make detachments and get
thither before him, which he was confident they would endeavour to do.
But that, if his Majesty arrived there first, he might, with the troops he
had with him and the garrison he found there, prevent their possessing
themselves of the town, till M. Lausun could make the retreat, which
he prayed him to leave to his conduct; and advised him not to remain
in Dublin neither; but to go with all expedition for France, to prevent
his falling into the enemy's hands; which would be not only his, but
the prince his son's utter ruin. That as long as there was life, there was
hope; and that if he was once in France again, his cause was not so
desperate, they being in all probability masters at sea. That he would
give one of his hands that he could have the honour to accompany him.
But he must make his retreat in the best manner he could; or die with
the French, if they were beaten. The King demurred. But he at length
yielded to de Lausun's advice. The whole army of the English had now
passed the river. Those who were not beaten were forced to retreat;
and, by consequence, it was necessary for him to do so too.</P>
<P>The seven battalions of foot behind the eminence advanced against
the enemy at Old-bridge to within a pike's length of the English. But
upon being slanked by the enemy's horse, they fled. Duke of Berwick
wounded, and left among the enemy. He got off by the help of a
trooper. Schomberg said to have been killed, by an exempt of the
guards, Sir Charles Take or O'Tool. It was a great over-fight in the
enemy, their army being so numerous, that, so soon as they had beat
the right wing of the King's army at Old-bridge, they did not march
after them; for had they done so, they might have got to Duleek be∣fore
the King, who was with the left, and so have cut off his retreat to
Dublin, and routed the whole army. But the King had no sooner passed
the desile with the van of his left, and was marching towards Dublin, but
Tyrconnel joined Lausun, as he was passing; at which time the enemy
appeared and offered to attack their rear. But they turned upon them,
with some horse and the French foot, and made so good a countenance,
that they suffered them to pass quietly over the brook, and bring five
of the six pieces of cannon which attended the left wing; the other
being bogged was lost. From whence they made their retreat to the
<PB N="229" REF="243"/>
Neale, another great desile, in good order; the enemy waiting still on
them, without pressing them. When night came, they followed no more,
However, that panic fear, which had seized the Irish, pursued them
still; for as soon as it began to be dark, the greatest part of the troops
dispersed, many of them having thrown down their arms and deserted
before. But the French retired in good order.</P>
<P>The King having yielded to M. de Lausun's advice, got to Dublin
that night, where he met with major Wilson with letters from the queen,
and an account of the prince of Waldeck's being entirely routed at Fle∣rus.
This good news encouraged his design of going for France. But
before he would resolve upon it, he spoke singly with those of his privy
council he trusted most; as the two chancellors, the duke of Powis,
secretary Neagle, marquis of Albeville, the lord chief baron, and others,
who were unanimous in their opinion, he should lose no time. They
believed the enemy would be at Dublin next morning. About midnight
the duke of Berwick sent an aid-de-camp to acquaint the King, that he
had rallied about 7000 foot at Brassil, and desired him to send some
horse and dragoons. They, however, dispersed before day-light. The
duke of Tyrconnel sent his chaplain to request the King to leave Dub∣lin,
and sail for France. The King ordered Simon Luttrel to march to
Leslip, with all the forces in town, except two troops of the King's own
regiment of horse, which he kept to attend him, to join M. de Lausun.
He resolved to go to France, to do something there more effectual, than
he could do with such a disheartened body of men as he had in Ireland.
The French general officers, when he was mounting his horse, arrived from
M. de Lausun. They requested him to be gone. They told him, that
even the French troops were dispersed to find provisions. That nothing
could be done. That the enemy were fast approaching to Dublin. The
King set out about five in the morning; he went leisurely to Bray, ten
miles from Dublin. He left there his two troops of horse, till twelve
o'clock, to defend the bridge, as long as they could, should any party
of the enemy pursue. He took his journey through the hills of Wick∣low,
and from them pursued his way to Duncannon. Having baited
his horses, at Mr. Hacket's house near Areto, he was overtaken as he
left it by the French general officers, who requested him to make more
haste, as they assured him, otherwise, that the enemy would overtake
<PB N="230" REF="244"/>
him. The King said he could not believe that any of the enemy had
so far advanced. They were positive, and the King mended his pace.
He left la Rue and a brigadier of the guards at a bridge, when it grew
dark, in order to stop the enemy in case they advanced. They staid
half an hour. They heard of no enemy. The King travelled all night,
and arrived at Duncannon at sun-rise. They found there the Lausun,
a Malouin of 23 guns, newly come with goods for Ireland. They pre∣vailed
with the captain to get under sail, and to fall down with the tide.
He went round in her to Kinsale; where he found M. Forar a chef
d'Escadre, with a squadron of seven small French ships, laden with corn
and wine, together with M. du Quesne with three frigates.</P>
<P>The Queen had obtained these ships to attend the King's orders in
Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following letter, from King James the Second's Queen to the count de Tourville,

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Translation.</HEAD>
<OPENER>St. Germains, <DATE>20th July, 1690.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“It is with great pleasure I learnt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Astle's Papers.</NOTE> from the major general of the fleet, all the parti∣culars of your late sea engagement. I waited for the end of it, in order to express to you my joy compleatly, and to join my rejoicings with your own, which I do very hear∣tily; assuring you at the same time, that the glory you derive from this great success, gives me a very particular pleasure, which you would have no difficulty in believing, if you was as thoroughly persuaded of my esteem and friendship as you have reason to be. For a long time before, I did not know what joy was; but I own, that this victory has given me a great deal, on account of the interests of your master, as well as of my own. After what you have lately done, I consider the King as master of the sea, and in a con∣dition to re-establish the king my husband in his kingdoms, and to free himself thereby, from a great part of his enemies. If we are lucky enough to return soon to our own country, I shall always consider that you was the first to open the way to it, for it was effectually shut against us, before the success of this engagement, to which your good conduct has contributed so much. But, if I do not deceive myself, it appears to me now to be compleatly open, providing the King could gain some little time in Ireland, which I hope he will. Yet I tremble with fear, left the prince of Orange, who fees clearly that it is his interest to hinder him, should push the King, and oblige him to give battle. But whatever may happen in that respect, it is absolutely necessary for you to have large vessels, as well as frigates, in St. George's Channel. The King is so thoroughly per∣suaded of this, that he was pleased to tell me, the other day, that he had already given orders, that, as soon as the ships could be repaired after the fight, a squadron of them should be sent to the channel. This being the case, I cannot hinder myself from entreat∣ing you earnestly, to hasten, as much as you can, the execution of this order; otherwise, neither Ireland nor the person of the King, my husband, can be safe.</P>
<P>“We see, by letters from England, that that wretched country is in the greatest con∣sternation. Time should not be given them to resume courage; and I am persuaded, that, if the king was now among them, he would prevail. But I hope that will be the case very soon: for his Majesty is full of goodness towards us, and appears to me to have a great desire to render us happy. I think he will succeed. For it is an action worthy of him; and I am persuaded, that God destines the glory of it for him. Next to him, you have the greatest share of it; and I shall be happy to owe to you, rather than to any other, such an obligation, as I shall never forget, and as will induce me always to look for methods of testifying to you my gratitude.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARIA, R.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>. She had so great an interest with M. Seignelay, the French
<PB N="231" REF="245"/>
minister for the marine, that he became extremely zealous for the King's
service. It was he that procured the sitting out of a fleet able to dispute
the dominion of the seas. This small squadron came opportunely for
the King's safety. Had the King been able to have waved that decisive
stroke at the Boyne a few weeks, he might have seen the French fleet
masters of St. George's Channel, and in a condition either to have trans∣ported
him and his army to England, or of hindering any succours from
coming to the prince of Orange, which was what M. Seignelay designed.
But the King's life was a chain of misfortunes and disappointments; so
that what advantages the French got were no ways beneficial to him.
His misfortunes were doubly such, by lessening his credit and interest
with his friends as much as it did with his enemies. He wrote to Tyr∣connel,
that he was going to France. He said he hoped to send more
succours, and, in the mean time, left them 50,000 pistoles; which was
all the money he had. He arrived at Brest, on the 20th of July, N. S.
He wrote to the Queen. He informed her of his misfortunes. He said,
he was sensible that he would be blamed for hazarding a battle. But
that he had no other post so advantageous to defend, unless he would
abandon all without a stroke, and suffer himself to be at last driven into
the sea. But as the unfortunate are censured always more ways than one,
some blamed him for hazarding too much, and others for his quitting
Ireland so soon. That counsel was, no doubt, too precipitate; and it is
wonderful, why Tyrconnel pressed it with so much earnestness; unless it
<PB N="232" REF="246"/>
was from the solicitations of the Queen, who, in a letter of June 27th
to him, entreated him, in the molt vehement terms, to save the King's
person, at any rate. He, however, ought not to have advised such dif∣heartening
councils, as to make the King abandon a cause that had still
so much hopes of life. It did him great detriment. It was not likely
that either his own people or the King of France would eagerly maintain
a cause, which he himself had deserted. But it may be said, also, that
it was the unanimous advice of the council, the generals, and all per∣sons
about him; there was too an universal panic, as appears from the
circumstance, that even the French officers, men of service, saw visions
of troops, when none certainly could be within twenty miles. This is
the only excuse for the wrong resolution of the King. He had also
formed a scheme in his own mind, which he found, upon his arrival,
had been actually laid by the court of France. The French, the King
knew, were masters at sea, ever since the battle of Bantry Bay. They
were also, since the victory at Flerus, confessedly masters at land. The
King imagined the sooner he got into France, that he would the sooner
convince his most Christian Majesty, that the only way to break the
league was, to land him, with a suitable body of troops, in England.
He hoped also to send a squadron to St. George's Channel to prevent
the prince of Orange's return, and to land some Irish troops in Scotland.
This was the chief cause of his flight. The news of the victory off
Beachy head met him at Brest; and he applauded himself exceedingly in
that resolution. The King knew of the design of fighting the combined
fleets. He knew, that M. Seignelay designed at the same time to send
25 light frigates to St. George's Channel, and to burn all the ships on
both sides, but such as were necessary to bring off the King and some
troops; and, by that means, to have kept the prince of Orange in Ire∣land.
All this well-laid scheme he knew; and it was the main induce∣ment
to his retreat. But the business was over before his arrival, as was
said; and neither he nor the French themselves reaped any advantage.
The sickness of Seignelay hindered him from going on board as he in∣tended;
which forced him to give that commission to the chevalier de
Tourville. His negligence in not destroying the combined fleets was
vehemently resented by Seignelay. Tourville ascribed his want of suc∣cess
to the English having taken up the buoys. Seignelay said, in a
<PB N="233" REF="247"/>
passion, that it proceeded from his cowardice. Tourville took fire.
Seignelay explained himself, by saying, that he meant only with regard
to his conduct; for that there were many (of which number he took
him to be) <HI>qui estoient poltrons de teste, quoyqu'ils ne l'estoient point du
coeur.</HI></P>
<P>The day after the King's arrival at St. Germains, the King of France
came to fee him, and promised him all imaginable kindness and sup∣port.
But when he laid open his project, he received it coldly, and said,
he could do nothing in it till he heard from Ireland. The King told
him, that there was no occasion to hear from Ireland, to convince him
that England was naked. But his most Christian Majesty was dissatisfied
with the King's late conduct, either of himself or the insinuations of
his minister. He was averse to another expedition, which might, he
thought, be as hastily relinquished. He pretended an indisposition, and
would not fee the King, till in fact it was too late to do any thing. When
the King observed this cause of delay, his patience never in his life un∣derwent
such another trial. The defection of his subjects, the loss of
the battle, the desertion of his favourites, had never thrown him into
such despair, as this not suffering him to open his heart to the prince,
who was his only friend and support in the world. But he was destined
to be, a victim to patience by Providence; which his friends, as well as
his enemies, exercised by turns. He even pressed to be permitted to
go on board the fleet. This was denied, as nothing, they said could
be done, without land-forces. The threatened junction of the elector
of Brandenburgh with the prince of Waldeck was the excuse. But this
was a poor pretence, when the prince of Orange, with 40,000 men,
could be kept from acting, by the other expedient.</P>
<P>The retreat of the prince of Orange from Limeric was shameful; a
place which scarce deserved the name of a fortress. Tyrconnel came
immediately to France, to solicit succours. The French and de Lausun,
being wearied of Ireland, wished Limeric had been taken. Boisleau,
during the assault, ordered several battalions away from the breach. But
he was disobeyed, and the place saved. There were factions between
the French and the Irish, and between the Irish and themselves; when
the enemy gave them respite, their whole business was to fight among
themselves. A faction was formed against Tyrconnel, and they pre∣pared
<PB N="234" REF="248"/>
to send persons, as they afterwards did, to complain of his con∣duct.
Tyrconnel took the opportunity of coming away with de Lausun.
The King, in the mean time, represented to the court of France, how
great a pity it was, not to support the successful valour of the Irish.
The bishop of Cork, colonel Simon and H. Lutterel, and colonel Nic.
Purcel, came to complain of Tyrconnel to St. Germains. Tyrconnel
endeavoured to cross-bite them, and to induce the King to seize them,
and keep them in France. The King, prepossessed against them, re∣fused
to see the deputies.</P>
<P>The earl of Anandale, lord Ross, and Sir James Montgomery cor∣respond
with the King. As interest was the prime motive to their re∣turn
to their duty, they first made terms for themselves. The King
knew it, but he resolved to encourage repentance. He appointed An∣nandale
commissioner, Montgomery secretary of state. When the par∣liament
met, they pursued their point with earnestness. The duke of
Queensberry, marquis of Athol, and earl of Argyle, concurred with
them. But the Presbyterians, whom they formerly governed, began to
abandon these undertakers. They, discovering that they could not carry
their point, were convinced, that they could change sides more easily
than governments. They, therefore, made their peace, by discovering
all they knew; and even suffered the very papers and commissions, which
came from the King, to fall into Melvin the commissioner's hands.
They, however, refused to be witnesses. Buchan was soon after unsuc∣cessful
at Cromdale. He was surprised in the night. The King's friends
began to listen to the offers of the prince of Orange, who was extremely
anxious to leave all quiet, before he passed into Ireland. He offered
5000<HI>l.</HI> and several other advantages to the earl of Breadalbin. Bread∣albin
went to meet the prince of Orange at Chester. But he was gone
before he arrived: so nothing was then done. The King's friends soli∣cited
then a supply, and proposed the King's landing in Scotland, rather
than in England. The King sent some present relief to the Highlanders,
by a ship from Nantes. The Queen had, before his arrival in France,
ordered 5000<HI>l.</HI> to be paid them from England. She had also ordered
10,000<HI>l.</HI> to follow it.</P>
<P>Mr. de Seignelay, the secretary for the marine, continued still zealous
for the King. He resolved to go again on board the sleet, to see, in
<PB N="235" REF="249"/>
person, his own schemes executed. But crosses and disappointments
pursued the King, through all the labyrinths of his life. That able mi∣nister
soon after died; and his designs, just on the point of being exe∣cuted,
fell with his life. Ireland, as well as Scotland, was anxious to
have supplies. The enemy had made attempts to cross the Shannon.
The duke of Berwick sent out parties, which prevented them; and en∣deavoured
to do what he could to molest them in his turn.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>1691.</HEAD>
<P>Tyrconnel returned from France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691.</NOTE> and arrived at Limeric in January,
1691. He found the troops there in a miserable condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maepher∣son's Ex∣tracts.</NOTE> The King's
task, with regard to Ireland, was difficult. The court of France was
divided into factions. Lord Mountcashel, who had a great and bene∣ficial
command in France, opposed Tyrconnel, and obstructed his mea∣sures.
The King ordered Tyrconnel not to use people roughly, but to
gain them by gentleness; which he promised to do, though he owned
it was not agreeable to his temper. The King was in pain for the duke
of Berwick. He had sent the commissioners against Tyrconnel to France,
and he was a kind of hostage for them. He ordered, therefore, the
duke of Berwick to leave Ireland, upon Tyrconnel's return. Notwith∣standing
the miseries of the Irish army, the English deserted to them in
great numbers. Tyrconnel said, that had he a pistole a piece to give to
the soldiers, and subsistence afterwards, he could assure himself of one
third of the prince of Orange's troops. Monsieur Louvois, a haughty
and a hardened minister, did little in assisting the King, or in removing
the miseries of Ireland. He writ to Tyrconnel, that he was surprised
at his complaining of the supplies; much more, that he would trouble
him with complaints against Mountcashel. His son, who succeeded him,
inherited his father's harsh and imperious spirit.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of May. No news in Ireland of the fleet.
The troops forced to eat horse-flesh. The king sent them 10,000 pisloles
out of his own scanty allowance. He was, in the mean time, pressed and
teazed by all his friends. They quarrelled among themselves. They
perplexed him with complaints. He gave all that he could; but that
all was but little, and inadequate. The attempts made in England, for
<PB N="236" REF="250"/>
the King's restoration, prove unsuccessful. His friends, however, in∣crease.
They wished to restore him, without the assistance of France.
But that was impracticable. They were afraid of a conquest. They
sent, therefore, lord Preston, Ashton, and Eliot with proposals. They
permitted him to live a catholic in devotion, but to reign as a protestant
in government: that the utmost that could be expected for Papists, was
a legal liberty of conscience: that the power must be placed in the
hands of protestants, who were two hundred to one: that the King of
France should engage his word to assist him only as a friend. They were
taken in a ship, which they hired. They were tried. Preston and Ash∣ton
were condemned.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this discovery, others were not discouraged from
owning their inclination to return to their duty. To the King's great
surprize, my lord Churchill and my lord Godolphin themselves were of
the number. It was supposed, that the intentions of these men were to
save themselves, in case of a restoration, against the King's resentment.
The success of France, and the aversion of the English to the prince of
Orange, made a restoration appear an event not far distant. Their
seeming repentance, especially that of Churchill, had all the appearance
of sincerity. Lord Godolphin had, in consequence of a promise to the
prince of Orange, as he said, accepted again of an office. When Buck∣ley
waited upon him, he inquired kindly concerning the court of St.
Germains, but with a seeming despondency. Buckley asked him what
he would do to serve the cause. He rose suddenly from his chair, and
said he would quit his office. This was a coy beginning. Buckley went
to Halifax. He received him with open arms. He promised to do
every thing that lay in his power to serve the King. Halifax was ne∣ver
to be satisfied, if controuled in any thing. This had alienated him
formerly from the King. The prince of Orange finding his politicks,
though nice and subtle in speculation, yet seldom good in practice; they
two did not hit it long. This free assurance of Halifax encouraged others.
Godolphin was particularly encouraged, and made open assurances to
the King. He promised to resign. But it went against his conscience
to betray his trust from any man. It had been happy, had he been al∣ways
so scrupulous. Mr. Buckley one day met Godolphin and Churchill
in the Park. They seemed mighty glad to see him, He invited both
<PB N="237" REF="251"/>
to dine at his lodgings. They came. They received him so frankly,
and they made such advances, that he proposed to try them. But lord
Churchill was so forward in the matter, that he prevented him, by send∣ing,
soon after, for colonel Sackville. The colonel waited upon him,
though with reluctancy. He was highly surprized to find Churchill
the greatest penitent imaginable. He begged him to assure the King of
his sincere repentance, and to intercede for mercy; that he was ready to
redeem his apostacy with the hazard of his utter ruin, his crimes ap∣pearing
so horrid to him: that he could neither sleep nor eat, in con∣tinual
anguish, and a great deal to that purpose. They parted. Co∣lonel
Sackville acquainted his friends. They gave him (Churchill) all
the encouragement imaginable; conceiving that a person of so great
credit in the army, and of such a considerable post in the council,
would be of mighty consequence to the King's affairs. But they re∣solved,
at the same time, to search him to the quick; and try whether,
by informing them readily what he knew, they might depend upon his
sincerity. He gave them, without hesitation, both an account of all
the forces, preparations and designs, both in England, Scotland, and
Ireland. To which last kingdom, he said, the prince of Orange in∣tended
to go himself, if the French pressed too hard on the confede∣rates
in the Low Country, that very campaign. He laid open that
prince's designs both by sea and land; which concurring with what the
King had, from good hands, was a great argument of Churchill's sin∣cerity.
He brought daily intelligence of incidents in the secretary's
office, in relation to the Jacobites, by which they avoided many incon∣veniencies
and troubles. He desired instructions without being admitted
into the King's secrets; owning, that the villanies which, he had com∣mitted,
did but too justly debar him from expecting any confidence.
He doubted not, he said, but he could bring over many great men to
the King's party; and desired to know, whether he should endeavour
that, in reference to my lord Danby, who, he said, was the main stay
to the present government; or join with the party in parliament, who
were contriving his ruin. He proffered to bring over, if required, the
troops in Flanders. But he rather proposed to act in concert with many
who were, the next session, to endeavour to get all foreigner sent out
of the kingdom. He advised the King not to bring with him too great
<PB N="238" REF="252"/>
a force: that a French power was too terrifying to the people: that
20,000 men would be sufficient.</P>
<P>Churchill desired the King to enjoin lord Godolphin not to lay down
his place in the Treasury; as he must be made serviceable in that post.
He said, for himself, it would be impossible for him to be at rest till he
had, in some measure, made an atonement, by endeavouring, though
at the utmost peril of his life, to restore his injured prince and beloved
master. His comportment upon the whole seemed candid, and his pe∣nitence
sincere. The King was always ready to forget the greatest in∣juries,
upon the least shew of amendment. He confirmed what he had
said in person, by a letter, Jan. 20th, 169 0/1; and in May 30th, 1691,
he assured the King, that upon the least command, he would abandon
wife, children, and country, to regain and preserve his esteem. He,
however, declined to bring over the troops in Flanders. The King
wrote to him, April 20, 1691. He wrote him in the most good natured
manner in the world. The Queen inserted a few words with her own
hand, to testify her being reconciled to him. He ordered Godolphin to
keep his employments, to be more serviceable; he having forgot his
former scruples about betraying his trust. Lord Dartmouth proposed to
come over himself, provided he could have the command of a squa∣dron
of French men of war. But the court of France were not for
trusting him; besides, he was soon after sent to the Tower.</P>
<P>The army in Ireland took the field. The French were slow in com∣ing,
but they at length arrived. Athlone made a good defence; yet
was at last surprized. Tyrconnel leaving the army, retreated to Li∣merick.
Animosities, as is usual in misfortunes, increased. The army,
from 17,000, was reduced to 11,000. St. Ruth being piqued at the
disgrace at Athlone, resolved to wait for the enemy at Aghrim. He
encamped himself, on a rising ground, in two lines. Two passes were
before him; one at the old castle of Aghrim, on the left of the foot;
the other 300 yards advanced from the right. On Sunday, July 12, the
enemy advanced to the bog side, while their horse took a great round to
flank the right. They had positive orders from Ginkle, not to come to
a decisive action. But being once engaged, the affair was brought to
a point. The Irish behaved with great spirit, to secure their liberties,
as an oppressed people. They convinced the English they had to do
<PB N="239" REF="253"/>
with men, no less resolute than themselves. Never assault was made
with greater fury, nor sustained with greater obstinacy. The Irish foot
repulsed the enemy several times, particularly in the center. They even
looked upon the victory as certain. St. Ruth was in a transport of joy,
to see the foot, of whom he had a mean opinion, behave themselves so
well. Fearing that the enemy should outslank his troops with their left,
he ordered the second line of his left to march to the right. His orders
were ill executed. The officer who commanded, supposing the bog in
the front would prevent the enemy from advancing, ordered a battalion
of the first line to file off also. Those who stood in awe of that batta∣lion,
took courage when it was gone. They passed the bog on hurdles.
They formed themselves on the Irish side of the bog. St. Ruth ad∣vanced
at the head of the cavalry. He would soon have dispersed them;
as they were yet but a forming. He was unfortunately killed by a
cannon shot. Endeavours were used, in vain, to conceal his death.
The life-guard squadron near him stopping, the rest did the same. The
enemy profited by the accident. They advanced. A panic had seized
the Irish. They fled, and left a compleat victory to the enemy. Night
coming on, prevented a pursuit. The Irish, however, lost 4000 men.
The loss of the English was not much inferior. Had they pursued their
victory, and marched to Limerick, they would have finished the war at
one blow.</P>
<P>Tyrconnel resumed his authority on St. Ruth's death. He proposed
to defend Limerick. The enemy appeared before it, on the 25th of
August. He sent an express to St. Germains. The King was, beyond
measure, afflicted. He laid the case before the French court. Some
succours were prepared. Some money was ordered. Colonel Lutterel
treats with the enemy about the surrender of Limerick. Mighty in∣clinations
were raised in the army to submit. Tyrconnel, though not
apprized of the treachery, was sensible of the evil. One Balderic O'Don∣nel
was long engaged in hidden and treasonable practices. It appeared
afterwards, that there was a design of putting the kingdom into the
hands of the ancient Irish, independent of, and on an equal foot with
England. This it was that had rendered O'Donnel so popular, and
raised him such a mighty crowd of followers, with which he lived, in a
manner, at discretion, while the war lasted; and he then made his peace

with the enemy, without the King's privity or consent. Lord Lucan,
though he opposed Tyrconnel, opposed also the treasonable practices,
with regard to the independence of Ireland. Lutterel's secret corre∣spondence
was discovered by his means. Lutterel was seized. He was
tried; but he had too many friends to be condemned. He was sentenced
only to remain in prison during the King's pleasure. The fire was rather
smothered than extinguished by this act of justice. Lucan's credit de∣clined,
when he sided with Tyrconnel. The latter, struck with a fit of
an apoplexy, died in two days, when he was on the point of reconciling
the Irish to themselves. The enemy, by Clifford's neglect, passed the
river. The town was forced into terms. The Irish, however, had the
courage to insist upon, and dexterity to obtain extraordinary articles.
Thirty thousand men, first and last, were permitted to pass into France.
Thus was Ireland, after three years obstinate resistance, reduced by the
power and riches of England. But though the King lost the country,
he preserved the hearts of a majority of the people.</P>
<P>In Scotland, the Highlanders were forced to lay down their arms, the
King not being able to support them with money. They sent the earl
of Dumfermling to the King. But before he received their information,
he was sensible of their condition. Though his abilities and interest
were exhausted by Ireland, he contrived to send some small relief to
Scotland, in a ship from Nantes. He was too tender of their lives to
propose to them any desperate action; and he, therefore, would not
pretend to do more than he was really able. He gave them a true state
of his affairs. He recommended to them a shew of submission to the
rebels, to preserve their own quiet; being perfectly assured of their
hearts at all times. He sent money to be distributed among their own
protestant clergy. They accordingly made their submission. But, con∣trary
to all faith, the prince of Orange, by an order which Nero himself
would have a horror of, ordered the soldiers to massacre the Glenco-men
in cold blood. It was hard to imagine, that the prince of Orange could
apprehend danger from such a handful of men. But he either thought
that severity necessary to make an example of, or he had a particular pique
against that clan. Either of these reasons, according to his morality,
was sufficient to do an inhuman thing. To obstruct his ambition, or to
give him a personal offence, exposed men equally to his revenge. Yet
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
this was the pretended assertion of the lives and liberties of the English
nation, to Whom all oaths of duty and religion were made a sacrifice of,
rather than he should not reign over it. The Bass was the only foot of
land, if it may be so called, that the King now remained in possession
of, of all his dominions.</P>

and his way of living suitable to his pension.</P>

The violent current, which had borne down every thing before it, abated.
The hearts of many remained true, though their hands were tyed.
Every day cleared up more and more the dark and hidden contrivances,
which had produced the Revolution. The number of the King's friends:
increased daily. They proposed schemes for his restoration. The cor∣respondence
with Churchill was kept up. Though his pretensions were
liable to suspicion, from his former conduct, his professions had the ap∣pearance
of sincerity. There was some cause to believe, him; as both
he and his mistress, the princess of Denmark, were out of favour with
the prince of Orange. Neither of them reaped any advantage from
their past infidelity, but the infamy of having committed such great
crimes. The most interested may be credited, when they can reason∣ably
hope to mend their fortune, and better their condition, by return∣ing
to their duty.</P>
<P>The princess of Denmark, herself could not then be presumed to dis∣semble.
She wrote to the King a most penitential and dutiful letter. This
was a more than ordinary, mark of the sincerity of Churchill, as he had
such power with her. The King received not her letter till he was at
La Hogue. Her letter was this:</P>
<P>“I have been very desirous of some safe opportunity to make you a
sincere and humble offer of my duty and submission to you; and to beg
you will be assured, that I am both truly concerned for the misfortune
of your condition, and sensible, as I ought to be, of my own unhap∣piness,
as to what you may think I have contributed to it. If wishes
could recal what is past, I had long since redeemed my fault. I am
<PB N="242" REF="258"/>
sensible it would have been a great relief to me, if I could have
found means, to have acquainted you earlier with my repenting
thoughts. But I hope they may find the advantage by coming late of
being less suspected of insincerity, than perhaps they would have been,
at any time before. It will be a great addition to the case I propose to
my own mind, by this plain confession, if I am so happy as to find it
brings any real satisfaction to yours; and that you are as indulgent and
easy to receive my humble submissions as I am truly desirous to make
them, in a free, disinterested acknowledgment of my fault, for no other
end, but to deserve and receive your pardon.</P>
<P>“I had a great mind to beg of you to make one compliment for me. But
fearing that the expressions which would be properest for me to make
use of, might perhaps be the least convenient for a letter, I must con∣tent
myself at present with hoping that the bearer will be able to supply
it for me. December 1st, 1691.”</P>
<P>Lloyd brought the above letter. Admiral Russel, who had the com∣mand
of the English fleet, still pretended to be in the King's interest.
He was dissatisfied with the King's declaration. There was a necessity
of doing all that was possible to content a person, who held the crown
of England so far in his hands. Lloyd was Russel's particular friend.
Russel had several conferences before he came away with the princess of
Denmark. He expressed his earnest desire to serve the King. He said
the people were inclined enough to his side again, if the King would take
a right line to continue them so. He advised him, if he wished to reign
as a catholic King over a protestant people, he must forget the past and
grant a general pardon: and that, as for him, he made no stipulations
for himself; saying, it was the public good and no private advantage
made him enter into this affair. He told him, therefore, that if he met
the French fleet, he would fight it, were even the King himself on board.
But that the method he proposed to serve the King, was by going out of
the way with the English fleet. This was an odd way to restore the
King by fighting him. He, however, meant nothing but advantage
to himself; as the preparations of the French made a restoration proba∣ble.
He was determined to raise his fortune, which ever way the bal∣lance
inclined. Had the French passed, by accident, or prevailed, by
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
force, he would have made a merit of serving the King;—and should
the contrary happen, he could easily keep his credit with the present
government. But the King was forced to seem well contented, with
what those men were pleased to promise. The design was so well laid,
that had not fortune crossed him, (as it ever did,) so many different ways,
there was no reason to apprehend a miscarriage.</P>
<P>The King arrived at Caen, in Normandy, on the 24th of April, N. S.
Tourville had orders to seek out the English fleet, then supposed to be
alone. The transports in coming round from Havre, were miserably
battered in a storm. He came into the presence of the enemy. Piqued
at de Seignelay's reflections on his conduct off Beachy-head, he thought
fit to observe his orders to the letter. He maintained the fight with
equality enough, till about four in the afternoon. There was some doubt
of Carter. But his designs remained a secret, by his being killed at the
beginning of the action. It was even in doubt, by what hand he died.
The French suffered little. The calm ceased. The unseasonable be∣haviour
of Tourville brought on a second engagement. He was asham∣ed
of shewing his stern to an enemy. He trusted too much to the Royal
Sun, a mighty ship of 120 guns. He could never disengage himself
after. He was forced to the scurvy alternative of either running ashore
or of being taken. When even they ran into La Hogue, they might be
saved had they followed the King's advice; who recommended to man
the ships with the land troops, to keep off the English frigates and boats.
The admiral was obstinate. Yet his men abandoned the ships, upon the
first approach of the English; though only in shaloops. The King was
beyond measure afflicted. But he resolved to continue his endeavours
for his restoration. He now began to wean himself from the world and
all thoughts of present happiness. He saw that Providence designed to
lead him, through the paths of affliction to his grave. He, however
continued his correspondence with England, particularly with Churchill
and Russel. Middleton, on whose management the King chiefly relied,
to try to give strength and stability to these scattered reeds, began to treat
with his friends again. Shrewsbury, Danby, Godolphin, Russel and
others, seemed desirous that the King should be restored; and so were
many, from the dismal prospect of continual wars, till things should
return to their old channel.</P>

<P>Soon after the French fleet was beat by Russel, captain Lloyd
came to the King at La Hogue; having been dispatched by some of
the King's friends in England, with a message of great consequence,
two months before, but could find no means, of getting over. The
French fleet being beat, nothing could be then done. The correspon∣dence,
however, was kept up; though Lloyd, being seen accidently by
some of his acquaintances at La Hogue, durst not return to England.
The King, therefore, came to St. Germains, and sent Mr. Carryl to
England, about August; who did not return till January, 1693. He
brought the King eight proposals, which, if he agreed to, they would
restore him immediately; and, upon notice of his consent, would send
lord Middleton to him, fully instructed. The King, by the King of
France's advice, agreed to them; and, on the twelvth of July, wrote so
to lord Middleton.</P>

Feb. 28th, 1694. He told him, that lord Shrewsbury was so pressed to
receive his former office of secretary, that he was afraid he could not
resist. But though he altered his condition, he assured him that he would
not alter his inclinations. Yet Churchill himself was the adviser of
Shrewsbury, hoping he would do himself the same good turn. He told

The princess of Orange dies December 28, O. S. The King made no
efforts upon her death. Her proximity of blood was the prince of
Orange's chief support. He hoped the government might shake and
unhinge itself. The princess of Denmark, notwithstanding her pro∣fessions
and late repentance, appeared to be more satisfied with the prince
of Orange, though he had used her ill and usurped upon her right, than
that her father, who had always cherished her beyond expression, should
be restored. So that all that the King got was an additional affliction to
those he had already undergone, by seeing his child he loved so tenderly
persevere, to her death, in such a signal state of disobedience and dis∣loyalty;
and to hear her extolled, for a crime as for the highest virtue,
by the mercenary flatterers of the times; even arch bishop Tennison
reckoned, among her virtues, her contradictions; and that she had
got the better of her duty to a parent, in consideration of her religion
and her country. But his own children had lost all bowels of compassion
and duty for the King. The King was much afflicted at her manner of
dying.</P>

The greater part of them seem de∣signed only for his own private use, to imprint more deeply, in his memory, those great truths of Christianity, which had so fully possessed him: for though they are writ upon several subjects, all tending to policy and religion; yet none of them had any titles put to them, to distinguish the matters treated in each of them. But, for the ease and benefit of the reader, titles are now put to them, suitable to the matter they contain. Some three or four of them the reader will find occasionally inserted in the relation of his life, which are not, therefore, here inserted.”</P>
<P>“It was the constant practice of this King, ever since he first appeared in the world, to write short notes, from time to time, of all that was remarkable in the affairs wherein he had any share. All these memoirs of passages, which occurred before his last escape out of England, have been happily preserved, though they were writ on several loose pa∣pers; and they may possibly serve hereafter, as materials for making a complete and authentic history of his whole life; they being safely kept, by his Majesty's order, in the library of the Scotch college at Paris. But these writ by him since the revolution, are of a quite different nature from the former. In the first, he sets down what passed abroad in the world and in the public affairs wherein he was concerned; in these, he describes what passed within his own soul, filled with the sentiments of repentance and devotion.
It may be truly said, that his own picture is to be seen in them, drawn to the life, as he was in his latter days for he practised himself all that he hath here writ; and his out∣ward actions, no less than the thoughts and affections of his mind, were all conformable to the rules and actions he here sets down.”</P>

it happens, that the young man has a friend or relation, who gives him
good advice and would hinder him from running headlong into these
dangerous and pernicious courses, he is turned into ridicule, by these
ministers of iniquity. If the adviser is a little advanced in years, they
laugh at him, and call him a bigot, or they represent him as a man who
has some prejudice against them, and who, when he was young, sati∣ated
himself with those very pleasures, which he now condemns in
others.</P>
<P>This is the doctrine commonly preached to a young man by his com∣panions,

weak, stupid, and hypocondrical, deprive themselves of the pleasures
of this world, or trouble themselves with frequenting churches, hearing
sermons, or reading good books.</P>
<P>It is by these arguments suggested by the devil and by ill example,
that young men like you are daily perverted. Do not, therefore, allow
yourself to be deceived by such discourses; but let found reason and the
maxims of religion guide you. You have been in many dangers. You
have often looked death in the face, and have seen many fall near you,
where you have been preserved. Consider how much reason there is to
fear, that the greatest number of these have been thrown headlong into
hell, to endure an eternity of torments; and consider, at the same time,
how unprepared you was to die at that time, what would have been your
fate, if you had been carried off in such a state, and how much you owe
to the bounty of the Almighty, who did not allow you to be of the num∣ber
of these unhappy persons.</P>
<P>I know you may answer, and others may suggest to you, that I did
not follow myself, when I was of your age nor for many years after, the
good advice which I now give to you. I own, with confusion, that this
is but too true. That I was led astray by the vanities and sinful pleasures
of this world; and that I did not give myself time to consider what was
the duty of a Christian. This, I say, I own, to my confusion; and,
when I reflect on it now, I tremble at the remembrance of the danger,
in which I was then: for if God had not mercifully touched my heart,
by extraordinary ways; and, by the rebellion of my subjects, made me
sensible how greatly I had myself rebelled against him; in all probability,
I would have been eternally lost. But you ought to consider, that this
was a miracle of the providence and goodness of God towards me; and,
you know, that God does not always work miracles, and what happened
to me is too singular an instance to serve as an example to you. Take,
therefore, the warning which I give you, not to follow my example in
sinning, but in repenting. I give you this advice, as a father, who is
indeed under obligations to promote the temporal interests of his chil∣dren;

<P>We are all of us, as well as the monks of La Trappe, obliged to take
up our cross and follow our Saviour; and, although the duty of our
station does not permit us to practise so austere a silence as they do, yet
we are not less obliged than they are, to govern our tongues in such a
manner as not to offend our neighbour. Likewise, although we have
not made vows to govern our eyes in the same manner as they have, we
are as much obliged as they are, to set a watch on our eyes, so as that we
may avoid to look on the dangerous objects which have caused the
ruin of so many souls; and, though we are not under an obligation to
practise so much abstinence, nor to apply to manual labour as they do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, N. D. vol. i. Fol. No. 7. and D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 50. D. N. vol. i. Fol. No. 128, 129. D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5. and 32.</NOTE> yet
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
we are obliged to observe temperance and sobriety in our eating, and not
to allow ourselves to go to any excess in that way; and, if we cannot
work with our hands, we ought always to avoid idleness, to apply, with
attention, to our own business, and to assist our neighbour as much as we
can. Lastly, we should have the same Christian spirit with the monks of
La Trappe, and allow ourselves to be guided by the same maxims; and
each, in his station and manner, should endeavour to work out his own
salvation, with the same care, and the same fear and trembling as they
do. They are men like us, and we are under the same obligations with
them. Jesus Christ died for us all; and we are all equally obliged to
follow his steps and to obey his precepts; to be humble and patient, and
always to remember, that, without these two Christian virtues, we can∣not
hope to persevere in our duty, nor to hinder our abandoning our∣selves
to the false and deceitful maxims of the world, to which we will
be easily enticed, by the false example of those who follow them, and who
for the most part, discover their fallacy and deceitfulness but too late.</P>

<HEAD>1696. EXTRACT I.</HEAD>
<P>On the proposal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts</NOTE> for a descent with ten or twelve thousand men, the
duke of Berwick was sent to England to persuade the King's friends to
rise first; only fourteen thousand troops, then in England. They could
not assemble or rise, till his landing, else the English fleet would inter∣pose;
but would, the moment the King was ashore, in their several
counties. Mr. Powel was sent over, in January or February, to per∣suade
the King to come with that force and to give reasons for it. All
things were ready at the end of February. On the twenty-fifth, the
King of France sent to the King to go to Calais, where, the King arrived
on the second of March. A proposal had been made, at the end of
1693, for seizing and bringing off the prince of Orange; but the King
rejected it. It was afterwards proposed by others; and again rejected.
In the year 1695, one Clinch proposed it, and desired a warrant to im∣power
him. The King rejected it, and charged, him not to meddle in it,
or speak more about it. Yet, when he came to England, he did to his
own club, and to Porter and Parkins. Charnock doubted of Clinch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Clinch, it would appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 50.</NOTE> was too precipitate. Lord Middleton writes to him, on the 30th April, 1695.—“Last night, I received yours of the eleventh instant. I consess, I was surprized to find, that you reckon still on a thing, which was laid aside, for the pre∣sent, when you was here; otherwise, you would have desired to carry with you, what you now so earnestly press for. You may remember, that the protesting of the bill was judged to be a total disappointment, for this season; because the market would be over, before the necessary commodities could be provided, without which, we shall not find our account. Mr. Benson [Fr. King] is gone to a farm of his, above fifty miles off, to see what condition his cattle are in; and is not to return, in three weeks, which would oc∣casion a delay in this matter, were there no other cause to be assigned for it. This is too plain to want a proof. However, you may be assured, that no endeavours shall be wanting, in providing what is necessary for the first market.”</P>
<P>On the first of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Did.</NOTE> Middleton writes in the same strain to his correspondent Syson, either of Clinch or some other person, who was suspected, about this time.—“Mr. Har∣rison [K. James] bid me tell you, in answer to the last paragraph of yours, dated the twentieth of March, that he had an ironmonger here, whom you might employ, as occa∣sion served. But, notwithstanding, if you had a mind to be rid of a couple of that trade, he approved of the proposal; and, in that case, they may be sent hither to receive fur∣ther directions.”</P>
<P>On the twenty-seventh of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> Middleton writes to Mr. Chapman.—“I received the favour of yours of the eighteenth of April, with the inclosed for Mr. Artley [K. James], as likewise that of the twenty-fourth, which came together. I should be sorry that our banker [Fr. King] wanted will or power. Many rich men have no money at home. At some times, unforeseen accidents may contribute to that, as in this case; but, there∣fore, you ought not to despair of payment. I have endeavoured to make this truth ap∣pear as plain to you and your partners, as was possible; and I am sorry to find, that you will not believe it. I am sure you cannot reproach me, that I ever went about to impose on you.”</P>
<P>On the 27th of May, 1695,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> he writes to his correspondent Syson. “I return you most humble thanks, for the favour of yours of the 24th of April. The contents of it were very seasonable to comfort us. I wish I could do you the like service. But things are here, in the posture they were, which I need not repeat; and Mr. Harrison [K. James] being to write to you, this trouble will be but short. Clinch is just come: but we have not had time yet to enquire concerning the condition of the factory. I am very desirous to know what credit he has on the exchange; and where he is judged to be most use∣ful.”</P>
<P>Upon the 21st of July, his lordship writes to Chapman.—“I cannot observe that men's malice has taken place against Clinch, though I am a living witness of their honest en∣deavours that way. There is nothing so plain to me, as that an election cannot be car∣ried, but by gaining of votes. It is the only way friends can employ themselves in; and, when any freeholder signisics his promise, he shall not fail of an ample return from the gentleman himself.”</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT II.</HEAD>
<P>The King is pressed again to make another attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpherson's Extracts.</NOTE> He was pre∣vailed
upon, by conceiving the kingdom to be much better disposed, and
the conjuncture more favourable. Before the King entered upon his ex∣pedition,
he found great difficulties about wording his declaration, for
the Calais expedition. Melfort had been dismissed at the solicitations of
his friends in England. Middleton, who succeeded him, was of opinion,
that the King ought to adhere to his last declaration. The King left St.
Germains, February 28th. The troops intended for the invasion began
to draw near Dunkirk and Calais. He was hastened off too soon, by
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
the court of France. The alarm was taken, before things were ripe;
and the intended expedition fell to the ground. Besides the misfortunes
common to this expedition with the rest of the King's attempts, it brought
obloquy upon him, by its being thought that he was privy to, or ap∣proved
of, the design on the person of the prince of Orange. Certain
gentlemen, thinking to do the King good service by it, combined among
themselves. Their first project was to surprize and seize the prince of
Orange, and carry him into France. But finding that impracticable, if
they scrupled his life, they were by degrees drawn into a resolution of
attacking him as he came from Hampton Court, or from hunting; and
if they found no possiblity of carrying him off alive, to make no diffi∣culty
of killing him. There is no occasion to argue upon this point, the
King was neither privy to this design, nor did he commission the per∣sons;
though he suffered most undeservedly, both in his reputation
and interest: for those unfortunate gentlemen, by mistaking messages
on the one hand, and their too forward zeal on the other, the most of
them lost their own lives, and furnished an opportunity to the King's
enemies of renewing their calumnies against him, and fix the people and
parliament, who otherwise began to waver, in the prince of Orange's in∣terest
more than ever. Crosby, it is more than probable, was employed
by the prince of Orange, to persuade the King to the measure. His
earnestness in this, both in words and by his letter, requesting permission
from England, made the King suspect him; and all the answer he made
was, that he thought him mad.</P>
<P>The commission the King gave to Sir George Berkley and others was
in order to a general insurrection of the Jacobites; which he understood
they were to make as soon as he appeared on the French coast, with such
a force as was agreed upon. The court of France was of the same opi∣nion,
and ordered their troops not to put to sea till they heard of it.
The King's friends on the other hand, meant that the King should land
first. The matter was like to come to nothing, when they waited thus
for one another. The prince of Orange's affairs had not now a favour∣able
aspect. The new-called parliament were resty and refractory. Sun∣derland,
who had advised the dissolution of his old parliament, began
now to be suspected by him. The King's party, called Jacobites by
way of distinction, thought it proper to blow the coals, as much as
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
possible. They pressed hard for men and ships, for the beginning of
the spring. They now asked but 10 or 12 thousand men. Some of
them even wrote to the King, that they were persuaded, that could the
King but once come to London, or some other considerable town, with∣out
any force, that the greatest part of the nation would rise and restore
him. The King communicated this news to his most Christian Majesty;
and he was, at last, encouraged to give the men; together with things
necessary for a descent for the beginning of February. He still pressed,
that the King's friends should rise first.</P>
<P>The duke of Berwick was accordingly sent to England to head them.
Many officers went to England and Scotland; particularly many gentle∣men,
who were wearied to serve as common men. The King's friends
declared it impossible to rise till the King should land: but that as soon
as he should come, they should all run to their arms. Their reply was
so reasonable, that it could not be answered. A mistake in discourse
with Mr. Powel, who had come to St. Germains, with an account of the
state of England, was the thing that prevailed with the King to move
them to it. Mr. Powel spoke with so much zeal, that the King thought,
that the Jacobites proposed to rise, when they should hear of his design
to pass into England; and, before Mr. Powel had put his request into
writing, the King fortuned to meet with the most Christian King, and
told him, his friends in England were ready to rise whenever he re∣quired
them. The King perceived, when Mr. Powel committed his
message to writing, that he had been mistaken. But for fear of alarm∣ing
the French ministers, he did not think it proper to stop their pre∣parations,
by unsaying what he had said. The most Christian King's
orders were so well obeyed, by Mr. Ponchartrain of the marine, and
Barbesieux of the land department, that things were ready, at the time
appointed, which was the end of February.</P>
<P>Though things were carried on with all imaginable secrecy, it could
not be possible to assemble 3 or 400 sail of great and small vessels, from
different ports, without making some noise. The Dutch believed, that
the French had a design on Zealand, and sent thither troops. No de∣sign
was suspected to be laid against England, till it was heard the King
had gone for Calais, which the most Christian King thought sit he should
do, as the transports were to rendezvous there on the 25th of February.
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
He sent Pontchartrain to the King, on that day, and, as the secret
could be kept no longer, he said, he advised him, if he thought sit, to
go down to the sea-side; but not to let the men embark till he heard
of the proposed insurrection in England. The most Christian King pro∣posed
to come the next day, to St. Germains, to settle the last measures
with the King. He came accordingly. He repeated what his minister
had said; and still taking it for granted, that the rising would begin
before the King could reach Calais, he pressed, for that very reason, his
setting out immediately. But though the King had no great mind to
go, till he had a return from the duke of Berwick, who had not been gone
a fortnight; yet, for certain reasons, he thought sit not to mention it;
and acquiesced in going in two days. He arrived at Calais, on the 2d
of March.</P>
<P>The King met at St. Dennis a servant, from the duke of Berwick,
with a letter to Middleton. The duke himself, having his chaise broke,
remained at Clermont, till it should be mended. The King understood
from some hints, in the letter, that he had not succeeded. He ac∣quainted
the most Christian King of his doubts. But he resolved to
proceed. He came to Clermont. He knew then the whole matter. He
ordered Berwick to proceed to Calais. It was a great misfortune, that
the most Christian King had not a right notion of the matter from the
beginning, and that the King durst not disabuse him, for fear his mini∣sters,
who were ever averse to such expeditions, should quash all, with∣out
so much as a trial. He still hoped, that something might happen,
upon which he could found a request to let the troops sail. He no
sooner arrived at Calais, but according to his usual fortune, he found his
expectations at an end. Several gentlemen had been seized for an at∣tempt
on the prince of Orange's person. England was in a ferment.
There could be no expectations that the Jacobites should rise. It was a
more than usual trouble to the King to see his project broke, his hopes
blasted, his friends ruined, by their pursuing methods contrary to his
judgment, and without his consent. Those who were executed declared,
indeed, at their deaths, that the King was no ways privy to the design
upon the prince of Orange's person. The proposal had been fre∣quently
made, for several years, but he always rejected it with vehe∣mence.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273"/>
The prince of Orange had a personal pique against Sir John Fenwick,
for some reflecting expressions, when he served in Holland; and, accord∣ing
to his wonted clemency, he was resolved to move heaven and earth
to have his life. He could not get two witnesses, as the laws of treason
require; and he, therefore, caused a bill of attainder to be brought
against him, in the house of commons. Thus exerting the utmost ex∣tent
of the legislative power to take away irregularly one man's life,
which could not be of such mighty consequence to the public quiet. Sir
John Fenwick's accusation of lord Godolphin, lord Churchill, and ad∣miral
Russel, and several others, did great prejudice to the King's af∣fairs.
This, indead of appeasing, heightened the prince of Orange's
rage against him; and added the weight of these powerful men to the
heavy hand of their master. Though Sir John was not believed, it con∣vinced
many, that their secrets were not so well kept, as they could wish;
and they afterwards gave this, as a reason for discontinuing their corre∣spondence.
It is doubtful, whether this was a disadvantage, in respect
of such men. It was a check, however, upon better men. The exe∣cution
of his friends was more affecting to him, than his own mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>He, however, had still some glimmering views toward a restoration.
The prince of Orange's ill state of health made people believe he could
not live long. He was become so dropsical, that it became manifest he
could be of no long continuance. Had he died, the King would return
into England and throw himself on the good-nature of the English,
though three men should not follow him. It could not enter into his
breast, that the people of England could offer indignities to a heart that
loved them so tenderly. But if it was God's will, that he should con∣summate
his sufferings, without any mixture of prosperity, and end his
days in banishment, in which so great a part of his life had been spent,
he resigned himself to the will of providence. But the ill health of the
prince of Orange raised a new obstacle. The princess of Denmark,
though she had all along kept up a fair correspondence with the King,
full of assurances of duty and repentance, began now to be allured, with
the hopes of the crown. She wrote to the King to know, whether he
would please to permit her to accept the crown, should the prince of
Orange die, and it be offered to her, according to the act of settle∣ment
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
made in the convention. She accompanied this request, with a
seeming sense of her duty, and a readiness to make restitution, when op∣portunity
should serve; and that should she refuse it, considering the
present diiposition of the kingdom, it would only remove the King the
further from the hopes of recovering his right, by putting the govern∣ment
into worse hands, out of which he would not so easily retrieve it.
But this was no ways suiting to the King's temper. He was not for per∣mitting
ill, that good might come of it. He could suffer injustice with
patience; but he could never be brought to countenance it; besides he
knew, that of all restitutions, none is harder to make than that of a
crown. The King excused himself to his daughter; and his resolution
of putting himself in the hands of his subjects, put an end to the pro∣posal.</P>
<P>But these were views at a distance. The King turned his thoughts to
reap a Christian fruit, from the seeds of affliction. But while he was
turning his thoughts on a heavenly crown, an earthly one was offered
to him; not indeed that which was his due, and which for that reason
alone he desired, but that of Poland. His most Christian Majesty sent
M. de Pomponne to the King; that the abbe Polignac, his ambassador
in Poland, wrote, that the people of that country had thoughts of him
in the election they were to make of a new King. That some particular
diets had already named them. The King's friends were sanguine for it.
But he made no other reply, than that he should ever retain a grateful
remembrance of the esteem and kindness those persons had shewn him.
That, however, he could not accept it if offered; much less would he use
any endeavours to obtain it. That it would amount to an abdication
indeed of what was really his due; and therefore was resolved to remain
as he was, though he had less hopes of being restored than ever, rather
than do the least act to prejudice his family. That there could not be
a greater instance, that it was the public good and the interest of the
prince his son, and not a thirst after rule and dominion, that made the
King never lay aside the endeavours of regaining his right.</P>
<P>The King received intelligence of a treaty of peace being on foot pre∣judicial
to his interest. He wrote thus, upon the occasion, to the abbe
la Trappe: “Though his most Christian Majesty has the same affection
and consideration for me he ever had; yet he may, perhaps, think his
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
condition such as to oblige him to make a certain step, for the good and
peace of his kingdom, which, I am confident, he will have a great
reluctancy to, on my account; and, therefore, I believe it will give him
full as much or more trouble, than it will to me, who have been inured
to contradictions all my life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nairne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. 4to.

N. vol. xi. fol. No. 7.</NOTE> in Nairne's hand, entitled, “Questions proposed by his Majesty to his confession.”</P>
<P>Qu. 1. Whether, considering the life I have led, and that my age, as well as the sta∣tion I am in, does hinder me from using those penances and mortifications, which would be requisite to shew the abhorrence and detestation I have of my past offences against so good and gracious a God, I ought not to be content, as a greater penance than can be inflicted on me in this world, not to make use of the usual prayers of the church, to en∣deavour, by them, to shorten my time of being in purgatory? And whether, what I have designed for that use may not be better employed in charities and praying for all the faithful departed?</P>
<P>2. Whether it is not more meritorious and better to lay aside, whilst one is alive, for such charities and other pious uses, as one designs, than to leave the burden on one's heirs and successors? And whether it be not deceiving one's self to expect any merit for such gifts, as one leaves to be paid by his heirs, after his decease, since it is a burden upon them, and that one does not feel the inconveniency of it one's self?</P></NOTE>.” The King was not mistaken. The
winter passed in preparations for war; but a secret negociation was car∣ried
on in the mean time.</P>

the character of his most Christian Majesty and the success of France.
He never thought, that he would have been thus deserted. In Decem∣ber

<P>Though<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a continuation of the Life of James, written by another hand. But as it was done under his own inspection, and corrected by himself, it possesses as much autho∣rity,
as if written by him in his own hand.</NOTE> no one could blame the King's conduct, in this total dis∣claiming
all treaties and accommodations, when he found the confede∣rate
princes no ways disposed to do him justice; yet there was one ar∣ticle
privately stipulated, which, had not the King too hastily rejected,
might have rendered his posterity easy, and his people happy. His most
Christian Majesty had underhand prevailed with the prince of Orange to
consent that the prince of Wales should succced to the throne of Eng∣land
after his death. That mercenary prince, it seems, had no great re∣gard
to the pretended ends of his coming, nor to the acts of parliament,
which excluded the prince of Wales, and all of that persuasion, from the
succession. He had, under the notion of preserving the church of Eng∣land,
usurped the kingdom; and, now, (that the work was done) those
pangs of conscience were vanished, and he was very easy on that head,
and ready to leave the church to Providence for the future, not caring
under whose government it fell afterwards, so he was secure of the
throne for his life. For this reason, he shewed no great averseness to
the prince of Wales's having the preference to those who were named by
the pretended act of settlement. How he would have brought about in
parliament this matter does not appear; because it never came to a trial.
But when this seeming advantage to the family was proposed to the
King, he could not support the thoughts, he said, of making his own
child an accomplice to his unjust dethronement; so immediately he told
his most Christian Majesty, (who had first made the overture to him) that
though he could suffer with Christian patience the prince of Orange's usur∣pation
upon <HI>him,</HI> he could never consent that his own son should do it
too. This was a point too nice to be pressed, in case of the least reluc∣tancy;
so nothing more was said upon it. But had the King taken lei∣sure
to weigh more maturely the matter, he might have found means,
perhaps, of reconciling that apparent incongruity, and for the sake of
his son and posterity have overlooked the injustice done to himself. But
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
the King was better at suffering injuries, than at conniving at them; and
the least shadow of an injustice was enough to damp, in his acceptation,
the best laid project in the world.</P>
<P>The King arrived at Fountainbleau, the very day the news of the
peace of Ryswick came. The King having long foreseen the blow, was
the less surprised; and so far from bursting out into expostulations and
complaints, that, forgetting himself, he seemed only to compassionate

<HEAD>EXTRACT III.</HEAD>
<P>When the news of the conclusion of the treaty arrived, the King was
at Fountainbleau. He arrived there the very day of its coming. The
prince of Orange, soon after the peace, sent his great favourite, Ben∣tinck,
in quality of ambassador, to Paris; and pressed for the King's
removal from St. Germains. In the first conference, between that mini∣ster
and the mareschal de Boufflers, he insisted on the same thing. But
he was cut short, by the most Christian King; who said, that if the
prince of Orange stood upon that article, he would banish all thoughts
of treating with him. This discouraged not the prince of Orange. He
still insisted upon that point. But the most Christian King was immove∣able.
The conditions of removal were the payment of the Queen's join∣ture.
The most Christian King chose rather to leave that money in his
hands, than exasperate him by demanding it, according to agreement.
Bentinck said, that Boufflers promised, secretly, to remove the King.
Boufflers denied the fact. But the most Christian King was not disposed
to argue matters with the prince of Orange.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange ill-treated by his parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1698.</NOTE> They tore his
laurels from his brows, and placed them on their own. They made him
account, like a steward, for all the money they put in his hands. They
gave him no settled revenue; but from year to year. They forced him
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
to send away his Dutch troops; though he truckled so far, as to send a
letter, by way of petition, to the house of commons. They were deaf
to his intreaties, and despised his servile suit, as much as they laughed at
the underhand threats of his creatures. They justly put him in mind
of his origin, and the hands that made him; and gave him to under∣stand,
that they called him to be their servant, and not to domineer over
them: and that, in case they discovered the least bad aspect towards
their liberties and properties, they knew how to make a sacrifice of their
own workmanship to a fresh establishment, if their rights seemed to re∣quire
it. This was a mighty humiliation to that prince, whose aims and
conduct smelt so rank of conquest, that pamphlets, which seemed to
support that notion, had not only been common, but allowed of by his
authority. The treatment which doctor Burnet's treatise on that subject
met with, checked others; and tended to teach the prince of Orange,
that as he owed his creation to the parliament, so he must also derive
from them his subsistence. But the King looked upon him, more as the
instrument of God's justice against himself, than as his enemy. He
never said any [p. 660.] harsh things of him himself, nor would he per∣mit
it in others; nor could any make their court worse, than by reflect∣ing,
in his presence, upon his worst enemies. He even never failed to
pray for them. [p. 670.]</P>

me, that next to the King my master, noe man had a greater joy than
he, for the news of a prince being born; and, says he, I am the more

were at his waking, at which time the news was brought him by the

<P>His most Xtian Majesty was also pleased to take notice to me of the
imprisonment of the bishops; which, till then, I was ignorant of. He
very much applauds the King's resolution in that affair; and said, he
was ready to give his Majesty all manner of assistance that was in his
power; which he spoke in such a cordial manner, that the sincerity
thereof is not to be doubted. Madame la Dauphine is indisposed, and
in bed; yet sent for me, and said, though she saw no man, yet she could
not forbear rejoicing with me, upon account of the great news, and ex∣prest
great joy: and the little duke of Burgundy, whilst I was talking

he would that night, for joy, order threescore susees to be fired. Ma∣dame
la mareschalle intends, in October next, to give me something to
send to the Queen, to be hung about the prince's neck, which prevents
the inconveniencys that commonly attend the breeding of teeth. The

<P>YEsterday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, A. L. fol.</NOTE> being St. Peter's day, the seven bishops were brought to
their trial, upon the information of publishing a libel, about their
refusal to read, or to cause to be read, the King's declaration. Their
trial held from nine in the morning, till near seven in the evening. The
King's evidence, to the number of twelve, laboured to prove the bi∣shops
hands to the petition; which was done obscurely. Lord Sunder∣land
was sent for, to prove the publication of the libel. His evidence
was, that, at the request of the bishops, he brought them to the King,
to whom they delivered a paper; but could not say that it was the same
for which the information was there exhibited. The council for the
bishops insisted upon their not proving, that the bishops wrote these hands;
next, that not publishing was proved; and if so, that it was no libel.
There Pollexfen and Mr. Finch took no small pains to inveigh against
the King's dispensing power. Serjeant Pemberton said, that what the
bishops did, was that which became them as peers; and, if the dis∣pensing
power was against law, how came they to be criminals, for not
doing that which was against law? and said farther, that he could shew
several judgments in parliament, and in cases in law, where the dispens∣ing
power was denied. The council for the King waved the point,
though Mr. Solicitor was fiercely earnest against the bishops, and took
the management upon himself; Mr. Attorney's province being to put in
a smoothe question now and then. Mr justice Powel declared himself
very freely, that he could not sind the petition to be a libel; for then it
must be salse, scandalous, and malicious. False it was not; because he
took the law to be, that the King had not a dispensing power; for, if
he had, most part of the statute books might be dispensed with, and
<PB N="267" REF="283"/>
there would be no need of parliaments. Scandalous or malicious it was
not; because drawn with all privacy, and presented with all humility.
Mr. justice Holloway had a mind to say somewhat to the purpose; but
did declare against the dispensing power. The chief justice doubted, as
to the proof of the publishing; but took the petition to be a libel.
Justice Allybon believed throughout, and doubted nothing. The jury
withdrew. The hall being full, and the Palace-yard, they made three
huzzas that were heard at the Temple. The jury staid till nine this
morning, Arnold a brewer till then dissenting, when they brought in
the bishops Not guilty; which was followed with so many shouts in the
hall, that it was with much difficulty they could be quieted. This is
the result of the long expected cause. The court of King's Bench was
yesterday and to-day very full of the nobility and gentry of the best
quality. I doubt this day's work will give justice Powel a remove; and,
it is thought, Holloway also; there being candidates enough for the va∣cancies.
Mr. serjeant Lehunt had his train carried through Westminster∣hall,
which is not usual; but whether ominous of promotion, I know
not. It is, however, a plain demonstration of his trainbearer's igno∣rance.</P>

the 2d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Memoran∣dum Book, in green parchment, p. 6.</NOTE> of the Dutch armament, and their design of invading England,
with another of investing Maestricht with 30,000 men, and enjoining
secrecy.—But he discovered it to lord Sunderland, who told it to the
Dutch.”</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>March 5th, 1733.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE duke of Chandos said, that Lewis the 14th, King
of France, having certain intelligence of the design
of the Dutch armament, wrote a letter with his own hand to King
James the 2d; and told him, it was designed against England; offer∣ing,
at the same time, to prevent the invasion, to invest Maestricht with
30,000 men, and enjoining him secrecy in the affair. King James
wrote him word, in answer, that the King of France was mistaken; for
he was sure the Dutch armament was intended to assist the Hugonots of
France. Lewis the 14th wrote back, in his own hand, that he was but
too sure of his intelligence; and repeated his offer, in pressing terms,
of investing Maestricht. But King James could not be persuaded of it;
and, by the return of this 2d express, the King of France had intelli∣gence,
that the Dutch had thrown 6000 men into Maestricht. Seeing
his secret discovered, he expostulated with King James about it; assur∣ing
him, that he had spoke of it to no body but Louvois; and if that
minister had blabbed the secret, he would disgrace him immediately, and
punish him severely; but desired King James to deal truly, and tell
him, upon honour, whether he had imparted it to any body. Upon
which, he owned, that he had spoke of it to lord Sunderland; but to
no body else. The King of France saw, thereby, who had betrayed the
secret.</P>
<P>ONE White,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October</NOTE> an Irish papist, who had obtained from the emperor the
title of marquis of Albeville, was James's envoy at the Hague, in
the year 1688. He had been placed in that station by Sunderland, on
account of his prossigacy, as a sit person to be tampered with by the
prince of Orange.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mem. d'A∣vaux</NOTE> Albeville made the most of his situation. He had,
at once, a pension from the prince, and another from the French King.
He betrayed James to the prince of Orange, and the prince of Orange
to Lewis the Fourteenth. Had he been honest, he was a man of no
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
abilities; and his loose and contradictory accounts of the preparations
in Holland might have proceeded from his weakness, had they not even
been the result of his knavery. The following are extracts from his
letters upon that occasion.</P>

England, and fight the English fleet; and to be masters of the sea be∣fore

join the fleet. The prince of Orange's baggage was put on board; he
not to go on board till the middle of next month. Their fleet are more

yesterday.</P>
<P>Burnet is embarked. Stuart, Ferguson, and Wildman are embarked,

<P>The princess will not be seen, till she hears out of England from the

desiring the prince's coming over, and, that they would take
other measures if he did not. Lord Lorn, the earl of Argyle's eldest son,
arrived here lately and is embarked.</P>
<P>If men come in apace, as they doubt not but they will, it is resolved
to form two armies, one the prince's and the other Schomberg's. They
make no question, but all Scotland will declare presently. It is certain
that the Spanish envoy had prayers said in his chapel for the success of
the prince's design. If your Majesty take notice of it, they will fly in
my face. The prince of Orange twice refused me audience before his de∣parture,
whereof all the Hague took notice. So unsatisfied he seemed
to be with your Majesty's late proclamation, that he begins his expe∣dition
with affronting your Majesty. If her royal highness was to be
seen, I doubt whether she would see me, since the prince would not.
She would not see me when I brought the last letters to her, but sent to
me to send them to her. There is not in hell a wickeder crew of men,
than most of the English and Scotch that go over.</P>
<P>This inclosed memorial, which I sent some days past to lord Middle∣ton,
by being sent by my express, I believe is detained, was penned

<P>THE Dutch sleet of fifty-two men of war, four hundred sail in all,
sailed yesterday, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, from
the flatts near the Brill, with the wind S. W. and by S. By the time
they had been two or three hours at sea, the wind became more westerly,
and has blown all night and morning hard at West, which may probably
have done them some damage.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange went to sea, on board a ship of thirty-two guns,
and Mareschal Schomberg with him. Admiral Battinent and vice ad∣miral
Allemonde are with the fleet, and command two capital men of war.
They pretend to land in Scotland; but Burlington-bay is the more pro∣bable
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
place. If the wind comes southerly again, they go to the North;
if it is North or N. E. they will be for the West of England. They say
they are equally provided for both. Above twenty English pilots are
with them; and they give sixty pounds to a master pilot of Hull, when
they get to shore. One man of war was stranded and another disabled,
in going out from the coasts of Holland.</P>
<P>The state of the manner of restoring Magdalene College, at Oxford,
has been much misrepresented by party writers. The following account
of that affair was written by one of the expelled fellows. As he was not
from interest partial to James, credit may be given to whatever he ad∣vances

<Q>Case of Magdalene College.</Q>
<P>The King sent for the bishop of Winchester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Ex∣tracts from Dr. Smith's loose papers, marked No. 12.</NOTE> visitor of Magdalene Col∣lege,
and ordered him to settle the society regularly and statutably. This
the bishop, upon my meeting with him acquainted me with, and ordered
me to meet him at Whitehall next morning, which I did accordingly,
just coming with some other bishops from the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12.</NOTE> He took me down
with him from the room adjoining to my lord Sunderland's office; hop∣ing
to have had the warrant under the King's hand and seal ready. After
about an hour's attendance, Mr. Bridgeman came to the office and told
him, that he should certainly have it in the afternoon. The bishop then
desired me to go with him to the Cockpit, where he was going to wait
upon the princess Anne; telling me by the way, that he would not stir
from court till he had obtained the warrant. Upon his going into the
princess's chamber, he bid me come to him at his lodgings in Old Palace∣Yard,
at five o'clock in the afternoon, and bring doctor Younger along with
me. We both came and he shewed us the King's order, which was very
full; but of which I thought it no way becoming to desire him to give
me leave to take a copy. I asked him, when his lordship would restore
us. He said, that he would not pitch at that time upon a certain day;
that he would make haste to Farnham, and that we should hear thence;
but advising me, that I would go down, in the mean while, to secure the
college plate and gold in the Tower, the Registers, and the like, lest they
might be embazzeled and taken away. I told him, that in the circum∣stances
<PB N="272" REF="288"/>
I was then in, being actually dispossessed of my fellowship, I could
not, but under his lordship's authority, ratified by his Episcopal seal.
Besides, upon leaving the college, I had made a vow to God, that I
would not enter in again, but when I was restored. Why, says he, this
is in order to your restoration. So the discourse fell; and he went soon
after, I think the next day, for I did not see him afterwards, to Farnham.</P>
<P>A letter from the bishop of Winchester, visitor of Magdalene Col∣lege,
throws further light on a subject, for which James has been,
without reason, much blamed. But though that prince was guilty of an
act of folly, in depriving the fellows, he appears to have known nothing
of the delay in their being restored.</P>

<P>The truth of the following anecdote is established by collateral evi∣dence.
The delay in restoring the fellows, however, has been variably
brought as an irrefragable proof of James's design of retracting his con∣cessions,
upon hearing that the prince of Orange had been brought back
by a storm. This storm certainly happened not till a day or two after
Sunderland wrote the official letter, which brought the bishop of Win∣chester

followed the bishop to Oxford. The King, when he saw the bishop at
London, asked him if he had restored the fellows; and finding he had
not, was very angry and sent him down to do it on the twenty-fifth.
The prince of Orange's fleet was drove back by a storm, on the twenty-first

eighty transports; and sent orders next day to admiral Herbert, to send
the transports with the cavalry to him, and told him his resolution to fail
the first fair wind. I read several of the prince's letters and lord admiral

<HEAD>Another anecdote concerning the same subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Ex∣tracts from Dr. Smith's manuscripts, Oxon.</NOTE> from Dr. Smith's manuscripts.</HEAD>
<P>The A. B. of Canterbury and several bishops addressed the King;
and, among other advices, recommended restoring the president and
fellows of Magdalene College.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loose papers, No. 12. Oct. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="290"/>
On the twelth, the King sent for the bishop of Winton, the visitor, and
ordered him to settle the society regularly.</P>
<P>Citation put on the college gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 16th.</NOTE> ordering the president, fellows,
and all persons concerned to meet the visitor on November the second.
This was needless. The arch-bishop of Canterbury and other bishops,
uneasy at the delay, signifying it to Winton, he came to Oxford on the
twentieth of October. The fellows, expecting to be restored, had been some
time waiting him. The King knew nothing of the delay; and, being
minded to have a great assembly of lords, bishops, &amp;c. on the twenty-second
of October, to satisfy them about the prince of Wales's legitimacy,
Winton was sent for among others. An express was sent to Farnham,
which followed the bishop to Oxford and delivered to him the letter.
The bishop not knowing the meaning of it, and receiving the King's
letter on Saturday night, set out next morning without restoring the fel∣lows,
who had desired him to do it that morning before he went, it not
requiring above an hour's time; and on his refusal, they used rude ex∣pressions
and behaviour, which put him in a passion and he bid his coach∣man
drive away. The bishop was sent down on Wednesday, and on the
twenty-fifth, resettled the college<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Prefixed to this extract there is an account of the beginning of this affair.</P>
<Q><HI>Doctor Thomas Smith's account of the proceedings at Magdalene College.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Ex∣tracts from Dr. Smith's MSS Oxon. Loose papers, No. 12.</NOTE></Q>
<P>On the twenty-sixth of March, Easter-eve, at ten at night, doctor Younger came to doctor Smith, with accounts of an express from lady Shattleworth of her father, doctor Clarke's death, at his house in Lancashire, recommending to him to apply to the chan∣cellor for recommendations to the presidentship, declining it himself.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the tenth of April, in the afternoon, Francis Bagshaw, fellow of Magdalene College, by order of the vice-president and fellows, came to she doctor's lodgings with a petition to the King: “We have been credibly informed, that Mr. Anthony Farmer, who was never of our foundation, has obtained your Majesty's recommendation to be president of this your Majesty's college, in the room of doctor H. Clarke, lately deceased. We do therefore, with all submission, as becomes your most dutiful and loyal subjects, most humbly represent to your sacred Majesty, that the said Mr. Anthony Farmer is a person, in several respects, uncapable of that character, according to our founder's statutes; and do most humbly beseech your Majesty, as your Majesty shall judge fittest in your princely wisdom, either to leave us to the discharge of our duty and con∣sciences, according to your Majesty's late most gracious declaration and our founder's statute; or to recommend such a person as may be most serviceable to your Majesty and this your Majesty's college; and your Majesty's petitioners shall ever pray.”</P>
<P>This petition had no date, but was written and subscribed the day before; Mr. Bagshaw and the servant sent up with him, having rode a great part of the night to reach London the next day in good time.</P>
<P>Dr. Smith signed it, and advised to present it to the King that evening as he went or came from the cabinet council. On which he produced an order from the vice-president and fellows, for delivering it to the earl of Sunderland, the lord president, with a letter from the bishop of Winton to him, at which Smith expressed an hearty sorrow. They went immediately to lord Sunderland's lodgings, who had just dined. They were admitted. They told him their business, and gave him the petition and visitor's letter. As they were to wait on him again, he appointed Tuesday morning. Sir Theodore de Vaux told him next day, that no petition had teen presented to the King or mentioned in council the night before, which made him fear Sunderland had suppressed the petition.</P>
<P>Tuesday morning, April the twelvth, Smith and Bagshaw went to lord Sunderland's lodgings, and Smith sending in their names, word was brought them, that they must come the next day. They accordingly did so in the morning. Sunderland said, “Sir, I have deli∣vered bishop Winton's letter and your petition to the King. The King has sent his letter to the college, and he expects to be obeyed; adding, he had nothing more to say.” Smith advised Bagshaw to set out that afternoon and carry back the answer to the college. He promised. But Smith having heard, the fellows had resolved to proceed to election, on Friday, the fifteenth, he went himself next day, Thursday the fourteenth, in a flying coach to Oxford, where he arrived at nine. Bagshaw either came not or was concealed till next morning. Smith proposed to address the King again. The vice-president agreed to it and the next two seniors, Fairfax and Pudsey; but all the rest rejected it, and went to a present election. They chose doctor Hough. Dr. Clarke had been recommended by Charles the second. Mr. Charnock and Mr. R. had been so chosen a little before. Smith would have gone away, but was not suffered. Charnock and Thompson went away. Hough and Meynard were returned by all the fellows, only two to thirteen. Hough was chosen. Meynard was sent with Hough to the bishop of Winton to be admitted and sworn, which was done immediately. Petition to the duke of Ormonde to desire his interest in favour of the election. His name was published, though he did not subscribe it.</P>
<P>Smith had named two others better qualified. Hough's submission was signed by all the fellows except doctor Fairfax and doctor Smith, who had no occasion, and owned by all the college except the under porter. Obadiah Walker and others were now upbraided for not daring to stand out. This made them evacuate their submission by an equivocal inter∣pretation. The King talking with Dr. and the vice-chancellor, complained that the fellows had not petitioned him before the election; and the vice-chancellor saying they had petitioned, “yes,” said the King, “after the election.” The visitor inquired of doctor Smith about the exact time.</P>
<P>Great collections were made for the expelled fellows. The princess of Orange sent two hundred pounds from Holland.</P>
<P>Bishop Parker dying, doctor Giffard, titular bishop of Madura, was made president.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>HAVING some necessary business in Essex which calls me away to∣morrow
for two or three days, I thought it my duty to give you
this account.</P>
<P>When I waited upon the King, by his command, on Wednesday morn∣ing,
the first of November, he told me that he had sent for me, when
he had nothing but the declaration of the states of Holland. But that
the declaration of the prince of Orange was now come to his hands,
out of which he read to me that short paragraph, of the lords temporal
and spiritual inviting his highness over; upon which I told him, I was
confident the rest of the bishops would as readily answer in the negative
as myself; and his Majesty was pleased then to say, he did believe us
all innocent. Next he told me, he thought it requisite we should make
some public declaration of our innocence in this matter, and likewise an
abhorrence. I then desired to see the declaration. But he refused. I
told this matter ought to be considered. “Every one,” says he, “is
to answer for himself. But I will send for my lord of Canterbury, who
shall call you together.”</P>
<P>On Friday, the second of November, I waited upon the King with
my lord of Canterbury and others; when his Majesty told him of the
prince's declaration, and made the lord Preston read it. Then he put
the question round, which was answered in the negative. The King de∣sired
some such denial should be published, saying it would be for his
service. But he would not allow time to send for the bishops at a dis∣tance.
So his Grace told him, he would send for those in and about town
to consult about it. Upon which, the King repeated twice, that we should
add our dislike; which would be very much for his service.”</P>

<PB N="278" REF="294"/>
<HEAD>Reasons why the Bishops refused to vindicate themselves in a public manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original. Ibid.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>“FIRST, We humbly beseech your Majesty to receive what we offer
in a favourable sense, since we have done nothing that can justly
deserve misconstruction.</P>
<P>Secondly, We humbly conceive, that a general clause in a declaration
not avowed nor published, is not a sufficient ground for a man or number
of men to vindicate themselves, as if they were concerned in it. And
further, if this declaration should be owned and published by the prince
of Orange, we beg leave to offer it, as our opinion to your Majesty, that
it would be a new thing and no good precedent, to put it in the power
of a foreign and general accusation to bring your Majesty's subjects in
particular, to a vindication of themselves, as if they were regularly ac∣cused
and legally tried, for a criminal correspondence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If your Majesty should think fit to make it punishable to
read or communicate the declaration; then, by making such an address
as is required, we should do an act grounded upon a thing which must
not be produced; and consequently we shall not be at liberty to alledge
the reason of our doing it, which must unavoidably expose us, not only
to censure, but suspicion.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As we have in all times adhered to our duty and allegiance,
we are the less willing to do any thing now, which may distinguish us as
men marked with a particular character of suspicion, since we think our
loyalty less blemished by not being called in question, than it would be
by the clearest vindication that can be made of it upon this occasion.</P>
<P>Fifthly, We beg leave to observe to your Majesty, that by an address
from a few of us, who are now in town, without the concurrence of the
greater number who are absent, it would look to the world, as if the
bishops (who we hope are very well united) were of different opinions;
or that we, who are now here, had more particular reasons of a vindica∣tion
than the rest; which makes it reasonable for us to be unwilling to
come within the danger of such an interpretation.</P>
<P>Sixthly, We consider that the clause in the declaration joineth the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords spiritual and temporal, so that, if it has any meaning, it must in∣tend,
that there is a concurrence of many of both orders to invite them
to this attempt, which would make it more imperfect for us, even though
<PB N="279" REF="295"/>
all the bishops were here to make a separate vindication, where the ac∣cusation
is joined and comprehends the temporal lords in it. So that, if
any notice is to be taken of it, it can be done no where so naturally or
with so good effect as in parliament; which, whenever your Majesty shall
think fit to call, we resolve to do our duty, and to employ out utmost en∣deavours
for the good of the church and state, and for preventing the
miseries which now seem to threaten these distracted kingdoms, and to
acquit ourselves in all things which shall be there transacted, as be∣comes,
&amp;c.”</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Sir George Hewit's confession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> extracted by Mr. Malet from his uncle's
pocket-book.</HEAD>
<P>“November 19th, 1709, Dr. Sheridan, the deprived bishop of Kil∣more,
in Ireland, told me, at his house in Sackville-street, in Piccadilly,
<PB N="281" REF="297"/>
that he saw, several years ago, at the old earl of Peterburgh's house, the
death-bed confession of Sir George Hewit, (made lord Hewit by King
William) who died at Chester, of a sickness he had contracted at Dun∣dalk
camp, in Ireland. In this confession he declared, that nothing
troubled his conscience more than the treacherous part he had acted
against King James; and particularly, among other things, he men∣tioned
a meeting at Mr. Hatton Compton's lodgings, in St. Alban's∣street,
at the landing of the prince of Orange; where were present him∣self,
the lord Churchill, the bishop of London, colonel Kirk, and
others, whose names the bishop could not call to mind. Sir George
affirmed, that, at the meeting, it was debated, how they should best fur∣ther
the designs of the prince of Orange, and defeat those of King
James, whose success they were sensible would be the ruin of themselves
and their religion. It was, therefore, then resolved, that King James
should be secured and delivered up to the prince of Orange, which they
thought might best be done when William Maine was staff-officer in
waiting. But if Maine should oppose it, then my Lord Churchill <HI>was
to pistol him or stab him;</HI> and it was also thought adviseable, that my lord Rochester should attend the King, in his march towards the prince,
who was thought a fit person to betray his councils to the prince of
Orange. This confession of Sir George Hewit was signed by his own
hand and seal; and transmitted to the old earl of Peterburgh, that he
might send it to King James, which he did accordingly, as the bishop
assured me.</P>
<P>“At another time, the bishop told me, he saw an original letter of
King James to the aforesaid earl of Peterburgh; in which he wrote, that
(being solicited to pardon his son and daughter, the prince and princess
of Denmark, with others) he could never have a good opinion of them,
or put any confidence in them. The marquis of Halifax, he said, he
could easily forgive. But as for the earl of Danby (who was called in
the letter the old midwise) he declared, he could never deserve his par∣don,
being so treacherous in his nature, and one that loved only him∣self;
and so likewise for lord Churchill, he said, his crimes were so black
they could never be forgiven.</P>
<P>“This account I found written in a pocket-book, with my uncle's
own hand; and, till I found the following account in another pocket∣book,
<PB N="282" REF="298"/>
I thought the person <HI>to be pistoled or stabbed</HI> was Maine. But the
following account, which you will observe was dated two years after the
above, makes it quite clear.”</P>
<Q>The same account extracted by Mr. Malet from another pocket-book, with Sir
Phelim O'Neale's confession of his appending an old seal to a forged com∣mission
from Charles I.</Q>
<P>“Dr. Sheridan, the deprived bishop of Kilmore, told me, (May 20th
1711) that he was present at the execution of Sir Phelim O'Neale, in
Ireland, for being the chief actor in the Irish massacre; and that colonel
Hewson coming toward the ladder, Sir Phelim made his publick ac∣knowledgments
to him, in a grateful manner, for the civil treatment he
had met with, during the whole course of his imprisonment; and only
wished, that his life had been taken from him in a more honourable
manner. To this colonel Hewson answered, that he might save his life,
if he pleased, only by declaring, at that present, to the people, that his first
taking arms was by virtue of a commission, under the broad seal of King
Charles the First. But Sir Phelim replied, he would not save his life by
so base a lie, by doing so great an injury to that prince.—'Tis true, he said, that he might the better persuade the people to come unto him, he
took off an old seal from an old deed, and clapt it to a commission he had
forged; and, so persuaded the people that what he did was by the King's,
authority. But he never really had any commission from the King.
This the Bishop told me, he heard him say. The said bishop likewise
assured me, that, being well acquainted with the old earl of Peterburgh,
and often with him, he shewed him, at one of his visits, Sir George
Hewitt's original confession, with his hand and seal to it (which was
afterwards sent to King James in France). In the confession, the said
Sir George Hewitt (who had been made a lord by King William) begged
pardon of God and King James, for his disloyalty and rebellion; and
declared in it, that the night before King James went to Salisbury, the
earl of Rochester and lord Churchill (now duke of Marlborough), the
bishop of London, (Stewart, also, who is now a general officer) (as he
remembers) and himself, with others, met; at Mr. Hatton Compton's
house, in St. Alban's-street; and there it was debated among them, how
they should do the best service to the prince of Orange; and, at length,
<PB N="283" REF="299"/>
it was resolved, that the earl of Rochester should attend the King at
Salisbury; but in order to betray all his councils to the prince of
Orange. And the lord Churchill should endeavour to seize King James's
person, and carry him off to the Prince. But if he could not do that,
he should pistol him, or stab him, when he was in the coach with him.
This the bishop has protested to me (more than once or twice) he saw
written in the confession of Sir George Hewitt.</P>

<P>“Soon after the coronation of the prince of Orange, having some dis∣course
with Sir George Hewit (then newly made a lord) about the late
revolution, he told me, when King James was at Salisbury, if he had
gone to Warminster, as he had promised, his business had been done
there. He and captain Cornelius Wood, who was then present, said Sir
George, he and I had done his business; for that Wood was to be
exempt of the guard, and I should have commanded it, and the lord
Churchill would have gone in the King's coach, being in waiting, with
the gold-headed stick. Kirk, Lanier, said Sir George, and many others
of our party being there, and most of the guards, and army, that were
posted there, right for our purpose; we were resolved to carry him a
prisoner to the prince of Orange: but if Dumbarton, Sarsfield, or any
other of the papist officers should endeavour to rescue him, then, said
Sir George, little Wood and I, that were on horseback, were to have
shot him; and if that had missed, then lord Churchill, that was pro∣vided
with a pocket-pistol and a dagger, would have shot or stabbed
him in the coach; for there was no other way of saving themselves after
attempting the King. But, as it pleased God, faith the informant, his
Majesty's nose very happily fell a bleeding, by which his going to War∣minster

quartered at Lewes, in Suffex) being very intimate with Mr. Keppel, and
going often with the duke. That he never saw any English nobleman
dine with the prince of Orange, but only the duke of Schomberg, who
was always placed at his right hand, and his Dutch general officers.
That the English noblemen, that were there, stood behind the prince of
Orange's chair; but never were admitted to eat and fit. He particu∣larly
mentioned the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Clarendon;
but they went away, when the dinner was half over. That the prince

never saw a man so neglected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> as the duke was. That, when they came
home, the duchess would ask Mr. Dillon, what treatment the duke had
met with; and, on hearing the account, said to the duke, it was what
he deserved. He ought to have considered how good his settlement was,
some months before. A reproach, which the c—ss of S—ch said
then, was not so proper for her grace to make; since to her knowledge,
it was the duchess that debauched the princess-Anne, and persuaded her
to that defection, from the King, which ruined him. Mr. Dillon said,
that he was there several days together, before he ever heard the prince of
Orange speak a word; and, asking Keppel, whether he never spoke, he
said, that he talked enough, at night, over his bottle, when he was got
with his friends.</P>

being expected to land there. Letters, from both the courts of England
and France, assuring he would land at Yarmouth, or somewhere in the
North; and, finding no man of war at Calais and Dunkirk, and having
some assurance that the King's fleet would not engage, divers captains
having declared they would not fight against their religion, as they have
been informed, made them resolve to sail towards the West; and, it is
said, to land some men in the isle of Wight, to keep Portsmouth blocked
up; and, by the manner they will dispose of their fleet, and reinforce it
constantly with fresh ships, they will interrupt all communication with
France, and be ready there to invade it, jointly with England, in the
spring. This is their language, as exorbitant as your lordship may
think it, and as impracticable.</P>

been left behind; it was thought the prince stayed a while for them,
beyond the banks. But he waited there for the return of one he sent to
England, who came that very night. The people of Roterdam, and in
all the sea-ports, began to exclaim and murmur against the prince, for
losing so much time, since the wind and weather proved so favourable;
for they think they will be received with open arms every where.</P>
<P>On Friday, the tenth, vice-admiral Allemonde returned to Helvoet-stuys,
from the fleet, to take care of the ships remaining; and one cap∣tain
Hag to take the command of the ship that is fitting. On Wednes∣day,
November the third, two vessels were dispatched, with above fifty
thousand of the manifestoes of the prince of Orange; one into the West,
another into the North, I believe into Scotland; and one Robinson in a
ketch, and another, employed for scouts.</P>
<P>A yaucht of Mr. Hugh Owen, in Wales, came from Milford-haven
to Roterdam, about two months since, pretending to be laden with
coals; but brought eight chests of silver, and has lain at the Brill, ever
since the fleet has been ready; and so soon as it failed, went to Wales to
carry advice.</P>
<P>Sir W. Waller was expressly sent for, by the prince of Orange, to
Cassel, and embarked with the fleet; to make use of him, in his free
parliament, I believe. Eighteen boats, with above seven hundred men,
arrived at Roterdam, on Saturday, the thirteenth of November. Two
regiments more are expected; and the ships are ready to take them on
board. Mareschal Homieres is returned to Lisle, with some companies
of the King of France's guards, which will facilitate the parting of these
men.</P>
<P>The prince's manifesto is now sold publickly, and in all languages, as
well as this inclosed fine picture; which infamous liberty they may as
well take, as the prince of Orange to speak, in his manifesto, so basely
and falsely, of the great belly of the Queen, and of the supposed prince
of Wales.</P>

<P>THE prince of Orange's friends, not satisfied with the States resolve,
for nine frigates to clear the channel of privateers, insisted with the
admiralty to let out immediately all the men of war they could, to secure
a communication with the prince and fleet; and a passage for four or
five thousand men more, three hundred horse, provisions for the fleet,
and a ship of ammunition and arms. So all the ships ready were or∣dered
to sail to the Maese. The States General consented to it. Two
regiments are to embark at Helvoetsluys. The States wanted the fleet
back; but could not tell how to send succours to the prince; the King's
fleet lying on the way.</P>
<P>Van Citters writes to the States, that Dartmouth had but seven or
eight ships that would fight against the prince of Orange; the rest would

Portsmouth, where seventy thousand pounds were already sent. That
the King could not march with his artillery, within ten miles of the
prince of Orange. All false.</P>
<P>Some of the States are in great perplexity, for the prince of Orange.
Others wish he may never return; and would speak resolutely, if the
French appeared powerful on the frontiers, or he had met a defeat at
sea. I have not received the King's sense, on the resolution of the States
to assist the prince; notwithstanding the reiterated assurances they gave
his Majesty, by their ambassador, of maintaining the peace. Strange

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the last camp which King James had at Hounslow-heath, which
was in part of July and August, 1688, the earl of Dumbarton, one
of his Majesty's lieutenant generals, sent for one of the field officers of
every regiment, that were Roman Catholics; and the majors of the re∣giments,
where neither the colonels nor lieutenant colonels were Roman
Catholics; and his lordship told me, and as I presume, and heard, he
did all the rest, that his Majesty had commanded him to send for me, to
give him a list of all the officers and soldiers in the regiment that were
Roman Catholics; which I was ordered forthwith to do, because his
Majesty expected an account of it from his lordship. The number of
Roman Catholics was then very inconsiderable in our regiment; being
but one lieutenant, a quarter-master, and thirteen troopers.</P>
<P>This order proved of fatal consequence; and was a very great fur∣therance
of the business of our associating officers, who, daily and open∣ly,
in the camp, aggravated it, with all the rancour and malice imagin∣able;
affirming, with vollies of oaths, that it was in order to turn out
all the protestant officers and soldiers in the army, and to have none but
Roman Catholics in military employments. That, in order thereto, the
Irish regiments were sent for hither, and the English would be ex∣changed,
at several times, and be reformed in Ireland, that not a pro∣testant
would be left in them.</P>
<P>This was so credited, that it brought over many to their party, as I
have often heard. But being confined by you, in this relation, to send
you nothing but mere matter of fact, to my own knowledge, I must
confine myself more narrowly to what related to the duke of St. Albans'
segiment, in which I served.</P>
<P>His Grace, both before and at the time of the late great revolution,
being in France, his lieutenant colonel, Thomas Langston, having the
command of the regiment, and being deeply concerned in the association,
was very diligent to aggravate the aforesaid order, with all the spleen and
rancour that malice could invent, to most of the officers and soldiers of
the regiment; and seldom failed expressing it, under several heads; the
truth of which, he affirmed, with vollies of oaths, to be to his own
knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="305"/>
First, That, in a very short time, the King would not have one pro∣testant
officer or soldier in his whole army; and that he had entered into
a close league with France, to have all the protestants' throats cut, in
England and Scotland.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the prince of Orange had his own taylor, that was a
papist, and his boy, in custody, that were hired by King James and the
earl of Sunderland, father Petre and Sir Nicholas Butler, to poison the
prince of Orange's waistcoat, which was discovered by the boy, the very
morning the prince was to have worn it; and, also, that his master had
confessed the same.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the prince of Orange had also, in his custody, the true
mother of the prince of Wales, who had sufficiently proved the same in
Holland, and would do the like here.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That King James, so soon as his army was modelled to his
purpose, would set up a mass in every church in England and Scotland;
and he that was not a thorough papist would be hanged, quartered, or
burnt.</P>
<P>With these discourses, he frighted and wheedled several officers and
soldiers to undertake with him, in his design of deserting his Majesty,
who had made him lieutenant colonel; and, if I have not been misin∣formed,
gave him twice money to pay his debts, under which he was
very uneasy. The further to confirm his officers to effect what was de∣signed,
he introduced some of them into the company of the Treason∣club,
as it was commonly called, at the Rose Tavern, in Covent-Garden,
where they frequently met to consult with the lord Colchester, Mr.
Thomas Wharton, colonel Talmash, colonel Godfrey, Mr. William
Jephson, and many others of their party; and there it was resolved, that
the regiment under the foresaid lieutenant colonel Langston's command,
should desert entire, as they did, on Sunday,—November, 1688. The
which was the better effected, because the lord Churchill, one of the
lieutenant generals, had ordered those regiments to go on the advanced
post nearest the enemy. The day before we deserted, a private cabal
was held at Salisbury, to agree on the time and manner of doing it. Of
which cabal was the lord Cornbury, colonel of the Royal regiment of dra∣goons,
Sir Francis Compton, lieutenant colonel to the duke of Berwick's,
<PB N="290" REF="306"/>
formerly the earl of Oxford's regiment, lieutenant-colonel Langston,
commandant of the duke of St. Albans's regiment, and some few others
of their trusty associating officers; and, among the rest, it was agreed,
to put their design in execution very early next morning; and not to in∣trust
it to lieutenant-colonel Sutherland, who commanded Sir John Fen∣wick's
regiment; but to deceive him and all the rest of the officers that
were not in their interest.</P>
<P>Orders were given, at the setting of the watch, being at ten at night,
that the quartermasters and adjutants of the foresaid three regiments
should wait for the coming of the post; by which, they gave out, they
expected marching orders. They, accordingly, did so. About twelve,
the post came in, and colonel Langston also, who had, according to the
agreement of their late consult, the counterfeit sham marching orders,
from Mr. Blathwayt, secretary of war. He called for the bag, before
the officers, and broke it open; and conveyed the orders so cunningly
amongst the letters, that none of those discovered it, whom he had em∣ployed
to help him to look for them. He immediately carried them to
lord Cornbury, the commandant; and, thereupon, orders were presently
given out for the regiments to be ready to march, at five o'clock the
next morning, towards the enemy; and, the better to disguise the mat∣ter,
it was given out, that several other regiments were to come imme∣diately
into our quarters, and refresh themselves and follow us. Two
days and a night we marched very hard, not keeping the direct road,
and had very little time allowed us for rest; so fearful were they of
being pursued. In the march, they were very apprehensive that the
earl of Feversham, the duke of Berwick, or Sir John Fenwick might
overtake them, and countermand their march; which, if any of them
had, or any other general officer, that was not of their party, they were
resolved to have shot them, as both lieutenant-colonel Langston and
others told me, when they were got into the prince of Orange's quar∣ters;
and in order to it, Francis Langston, captain-lieutenant to lord
Cornbury's troop of dragoons, and brother to lieutenant colonel Langston,
commanded an advanced party of dragoons in the front, and lieutenant∣colonel
Thomas Langston another in the rear, of the three regiments
that he drew out of his own troop, which he pretended were to keep
the men up together; but were, in truth, to have executed the aforesaid
design.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="307"/>
In our march, the earl of Abingdon, Sir Walter Clerges, and seve∣ral
others, came in to Sir Francis Compton, under pretence of being
voluntiers with him, and marched with him to Axminster, within six
miles of the enemy's quarters, where we halted the most part of that day;
and, in the evening, it was given out, that they had discovered a de∣sign
of the enemy's beating up our quarters. In order to prevent it,
orders were given out for our being in readiness, in the evening, to beat up
theirs; and, accordingly, at the time, the trumpet sounded, and the dra∣goon
drums beat to horse. After which, having sat three or four hours
on horseback, which was chiefly occasioned by major Littleton of the
duke of Berwick's regiment, and major Clifford of lord Cornbury's re∣giment,
who had information given them by some of their soldiers, that
the pretence of beating up the enemy's quarters was but a sham; and
that it was a design to desert the King; assuring them, that some of their
fellow-soldiers had been persuading them to go in along with them.
Upon which, the two majors so threatened Sir Francis Compton and the
lord Cornbury, that though they were the two forwardest officers, for
deserting with the regiments at Salisbury, yet Sir Francis Compton hung
an arse and sneaked away back to Salisbury, with almost his whole re∣giment;
and lord Cornbury stole away with his Lieutenant-colonel
Heyford, who was more resolute, staid, with most of his own troop
and some few others, not exceeding fifty in the whole. The regiment
marched back to Salisbury, under major Clifford, to whom his Ma∣jesty
gave the regiment. The whole time of being on horseback at
Aixminster, the duke of St. Albans's regiment was drawn up in a yard
and back street; and, at such a distance from the other two regiments,
and being very dark, that they knew nothing of what happened to the
other two regiments.</P>
<P>About ten at night, being the twelfth of November, colonel Lang∣ston
came to the head of the regiment, and commanded them to march,
which accordingly they did; and, about twelve, we marched into Ho∣niton,
the enemy's quarters; where, instead of beating them up, we
were received as friends, to the great surprize of those that were not
intrusted with the business. Brigadier-general Talmash commanded in
chief, where his regiment of Scots were drawn up; as also small parties
of horse of the prince of Orange's guarde du corps, Mr. Bentinck's re∣giment,
<PB N="290" REF="308"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="291" REF="309"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="292" REF="310"/>
and a party of Gray's dragoons. There were no regular quar∣ters
assigned for the deserters that night, but were all ordered to shift
for themselves, and to be on horseback, near the market-cross, at eight
next morning. Every officer had time given him, till then, to give his
answer, whether he was willing to stay with the prince of Orange or not;
and those that would, had all manner of encouragement, and promise
of preferment. Those that were not willing, were promised leave to
return, with their horses, arms, and baggage. But, before the time
was expired, their answer was demanded; and major Ambrose Norton,
lord John Metham, cornet Archibald Clincard, cornet Dennis Ash∣burnham,
and quartermaster David Brady, upon their refusal to embrace
the service, were all made close prisoners.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, the regiment was on horseback; and the con∣fined
officers window being just against them, they could see what past;
which was colonel Langston riding through the ranks bareheaded, har∣ranguing
and persuading the soldiers to stay with him. But about thirty∣three
refusing to serve, were immediately sent prisoners to the main
guard, which was kept in the market-house. So that the number of
soldiers that embraced the service, besides officers, were, of the duke of
Berwick's regiment, twenty-five mounted and two on foot; of the duke
of St. Albans's regiment, one hundred and one mounted, and fifty dra∣goons;
in all, one hundred and seventy-eight: a very inconsiderable
number to make so much noise as it did through the kingdom, of three
regiments deserting in a clap. But they, being the first that broke the
ice, valued themselves extremely upon it, and reviled the King their
master, whose money and commissions they went off with in their pockets,
with such base and opprobrious language, as is too indecent to be re∣peated.
They were so far from keeping their promise, of letting the
officers and soldiers return, with their horses, arms, and baggage, that
they plundered them of all they had, that only excepted which was on
their backs; and with such inhumanity to their fellow-officers, that they
would not suffer them to change their foul linen for clean, nor let them
have their papers and money, or any thing else, that was in their port∣manteaus.
The forementioned time, that the officers had given them
to consider, whether they would embrace the service or not, gave them
opportunity to inform themselves in what condition the enemy was;
<PB N="293" REF="311"/>
and the account given them, by several officers that came over with
the prince, was, that they were between thirteen and fourteen thousand.
But that they were in a very ill condition with their horses, by reason of
the great storms at sea; and that the prince of Orange had long ex∣pected
his friends in the army, not setting a value upon the country's
coming in to him. That this would be extreme welcome news to his
highness at Exeter; and that we had exactly nicked the time: for, had
we not come when we did, he was resolved to embark at eight next
morning, and go back, which had been the result of three councils of
war. But just at the breaking up, it was carried to stay twenty-four
hours longer, to try if any of the army would come in; and so little
hopes had they, till this party came in, that the prince had not so much
as brought his cannon ashore.</P>
<P>The Scotch soldiers of colonel Talmash's regiment, that had the guard
of the duke of St. Albans's regiment, treated them very civilly, and gave
them drink, and drank King James's health to them, on their knees;
and they declared to them their great dislike of the service they were
engaged in. They said they were all one King's subjects, and were very
sorry it was their fortune to be in the service against their own King.
They complained of their hardships and smallness of their pay; and
they wished they were so happy as to be in the King's service; and, if
he would but pardon them, it should not be long before they should
be with us: that they knew a great many more that were of their
minds, if they were sure of their pardon and of being employed.</P>
<P>Many persuasive arguments, with great promises of favour and advance∣ment,
were often repeated to the officers, in the time of their confinement,
to induce them to embrace the prince of Orange's service; and, among
many others, they assured them, that the prince's coming into England
was upon the earnest request and invitation of the lords spiritual and
temporal, the army, navy, and most considerable body of the nation, to
redeem them from slavery and popery. They also, with many oaths and
vows, assured major Norton, that a lieutenant-general, under whom he
had served, was the deepest in the association, and was the first who
proposed to them the undertaking, and had faithfully promised them,
and sent the prince word, that he would be there that night or to-mor∣row
morning at farthest; and not he only, but many others also, the
<PB N="294" REF="312"/>
most considerable officers in the army, and with the better part, if not
all, their regiments. The duke of Grafton's foot guards and the old
regiment were certain to come in to them; and that, in a few days, we
should fee the King the most deserted prince that ever lived. Some of
the deserting officers wrote to their friends what progress they had made,
to encourage them to come in to them; and with these letters and a pass,
after three days confinement, they dismissed the officers, and, soon after,
the soldiers. But, within an hour or two, they sent a party of twenty
dragoons after them; upon what design the late prisoners know not.
But they followed them a day's journey, and lay but three miles short
of the officers; only cornet Ashburnham and two troopers, going a-foot,
lay short, and fell into their hands. They took from them their money
and the cornet's cloak, which was all that was left them before, but
just the cloaths on their backs. They told them their business was with
monsieur, their major, and were very inquisitive after him. But, hearing
no account of him, they returned back.</P>
<P>These officers and soldiers thus coming away, so much discouraged
many of them, that they sneaked away again. His Majesty and the
earl of Feversham, his lieutenant-general, received the officers and sol∣diers,
that were so trepanned into the enemy's quarters, and returned to
their duty, most extraordinary kindly, at Salisbury; and, after the ma∣jor
had acquainted his Majesty with all the discoveries he had made,
by being in the enemy's quarters, which were further confirmed by se∣veral
letters which fell into his majesty's hands, he was graciously pleased
to make the major lieutenant-colonel of the duke of St. Albans's regi∣ment,
and advanced all the rest of the officers, and gave to each two
hundred days pay to equip themselves, and also five pounds to each
trooper; and orders were given, that the corporals should be made
quarter-masters; and as many of the troopers as were fit, and vacancies,
to be made corporals; and each to have twenty pounds more to re∣mount
him and the regiment recruited. The officers and soldiers re∣ceived
all this money at Salisbury, without any deduction of poundage:
so affectionately kind was the King to those of his army as did their
duty; which, together with many of the regiment that were not able
to get up, by reason of the hardness of the march, made up above
eighty soldiers, who were afterwards at Highgate. But, by reason of
<PB N="295" REF="313"/>
his Majesty's going away, that regiment was not recruited; lieutenant
colonel Norton paying constant attendance on his Majesty, even to his
last departure from Rochester. A corporal or two, and several trum∣peters,
that had marched a-foot from Honiton to Salisbury, followed
him to Rochester, to tender their service there. But, it being then too
late, they returned home to their own country, which was Derbyshire,
where they had been raised by the earl of Scarsdale. Several of the
loyal soldiers were of the Peak. Had not these things gone on so fast,
these soldiers had discovered a spy or decoy, in their march from Honi∣ton
to Salisbury, which might have been of service to his Majesty.</P>
<P>The spy treated them very kindly with all that the place afforded,
and insinuated himself very much into them, under pretence of desiring
to be a trooper with them; and, after having drunk very hard with
them, desired to know what pay they had. When he was told two shil∣lings
and sixpence a day, he said it was very small; and that he had
been at Exeter, and was there pressed five shillings a day to be a trooper,
with two leather pouches full of money, to buy him a better horse. By
this discourse, they believed he designed to decoy them back again; after
which, he slipt from them. But they, acquainting their officers with
it, were ordered by them to make enquiry after him, which they were
very diligent in doing; and, after some short time, found him at∣tempting
the same thing on the foot guards, where, by order, he was
confined on the main guard in the sessions-house at Salisbury. Notice
whereof being given to lieutenant colonel Langston, he went and exa∣mined
him there; and, reflecting on what he had said to the troopers,
and by some papers found in his pocket, it appeared that he was a cap∣tain
or master of ship, a Taunton man, and undoubtedly what he was
suspected to be. Lieutenant-colonel Norton acquainting the King with
it, he ordered one of the secretaries of state to go and examine him
again, and commanded the lieutenant-colonel to attend him; which be∣ing
accordingly done, he was convinced that he was one of the prince
of Orange's decoys or spies; and gave him till next morning, about
eight, to confess or die. But that night, the lord Churchill, who had
been till near twelve in his Majesty's bedchamber at a council of war,
deserting, with some others, his Majesty altering all his measures, and
retiring from Salisbury, our spy was lost; or, at least, I never heard
<PB N="296" REF="314"/>
of him. These are all the remarkable passages that I can remember to
have been acted, by the duke of St. Albans's regiment, relating to the
late great REVOLUTION.</P>

there must be necessary care taken to send me provisions; for this place

the navy in harbour, the dock and stores from the folly and rage

to your Highness which I think no time ought to be lost in; which is,
speedily to send some of the lesser ships off the bank of Guernsey, and
put good garrisons in Jersey and Guernsey; the latter of which, if it
should be possessed by the French, will be a thorn in England's side for
ever. If your Highness will please to call for the survey of that place,
from the officers of the Ordnance, you will please to judge better of it,

<P>The credit to be given to the following anecdote, concerning James
when at Rochester, must depend on the persons by whom it is related.
It must, however, be observed, that the language ascribed to the lords
Middleton and Dundee, is extremely suitable to their characters. Middle∣ton
was cool, moderate, and sensible; Dundee active, bold, and full of
fire. James himself owns that Middleton argued, for some time, against
his intended flight. The earl of Balcarras mentions, in his Memoirs, an
anecdote not dissimilar to the following, given by Carte.</P>

<HEAD>An anecdote from Lord Middleton concerning K. James 2d, when at Rochester.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Memoran∣dum Book, vol. xi. 4to, p. 132.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>January 5th, 1739–40.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE earl of Middleton told me, that, when King James
the 2d was at Rochester, his father, the earl of Dunbarton
and lord Dundee were with him, and the fire wanting to be put to rights
and renewed, the King was so deserted, there was not a servant of his in the
way. The earl of Middleton, who had gone into the outward room, to see
for one, told the King there was none in the way but a servant of his own,
(David Middleton, afterwards steward to the duke of Bedford, whom I
<PB N="300" REF="318"/>
knew well) and if his Majesty pleased, he would call him in to mend
the fire. The King desired it, and David came in. Whilst he was ad∣justing
the fire, he heard them continue an earnest discourse, wherein
they were engaged; and lord Dundee said, Sir, the question is, whether
you shall stay in England or go to France? My opinion is, you should
stay in England. Make your stand here and summon your subjects to
your allegiance. 'Tis true, your army is disbanded by your own autho∣rity.
But though disbanded, not so dispersed, but, if you will give me
your commission, I will undertake to get 10,000 of them together; and
march through all England with your standard at their head, and drive
all the Dutch before you.</P>
<P>The King said, he believed it might be done; but it would cause
a civil war; and he would not do so much mischief to the English na∣tion,
which he loved, and would come soon to their senses again. The
earl of Middleton, thereupon, said, that since his Majesty rejected the
party of force, he should stay in the kingdom at any rate, though the
remotest quarter. For though his going abroad might put them into a
confusion for some time, it would not be more than a six weeks affair;
by which time a new government would be settled, and he would be
ruined. The King, soon after, stole away for France.</P>
<P>This, David Middleton told the present earl he heard, but went away
without hearing the rest of the discourse.</P>

<HEAD>1689.</HEAD>
<P>INnocent the Eleventh possessed the See of Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689. January.</NOTE> when the revolution
happened in Great Britain. His aversion to France threw him into the
arms of the Emperor; and he supported, in some degree, the cause of
the allies, with the money of the church. He followed the example
of some of his predecessors, in endeavouring to unite the Christian princes
against the Turks; and it was, in some measure, through his persuasion,
that John Sobieski, King of Poland, came to the relief of Vienna;
while he prevailed with the Venetians to join in the alliance, and fur∣nished
them with considerable subsidies for carrying on the war.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding his zeal for the catholic religion, Innocent was, by no
means a friend to King James. His aversion to Lewis XIV. had joined
him to the allies, and even connected him with the prince of Orange.
Many catholic princes followed the example of the father of the church.
The Spanish ambassador at the Hague ordered masses to be said pub∣lickly
in his chapel for the success of the prince's expedition. The
emperor espoused his cause with all his influence, at Rome; and he
himself had the address to persuade the Pope, that the interest of the
Roman Catholics, and the restoration of their religion in Britain, were
connected with the success of his enterprize.</P>
<P>The following anecdote may be joined to other known proofs of this
circumstance.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“An anecdote from Prince Vaudemont,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Me∣morandum book, mark∣ed vol. xi. 4to. p. 33.</NOTE> concerning the Prince of Orange's
engagement with the Pope.”</HEAD>
<P>“P. Vaudemont was an intimate friend of the prince of Orange, and
had all his confidence; when the league of Augsburg was on foot,
and P. O. entertained thoughts of mounting the throne of England, he
<PB N="302" REF="320"/>
thought it necessary to pre-engage the Pope, Emperor, and King of
Spain to favour his enterprize upon England. He, therefore, told P.
Vaudemont, that the Pope and the Roman Catholic princes were in the
wrong to expect any thing from K. James, in favour of the Romish
faith: that his being declared of that religion, made every body jealous
of the least and most indifferent step he took; and it was, therefore,
impracticable for him to do them any service; for the whole nation
would oppose it, as tending to destroy the church of England; whereas
himself, being a protestant, might take any step whatever, and serve
them effectually, without the least suspicion; and, in case they would
favour and promote his attempt upon England, he would undertake to
procure a toleration for the Roman Catholics. P. Vaudemont went to
Rome; and with this argument, engaged the Pope, the Emperor, and
the King of Spain, to come into the P. of Orange's scheme, and favour
his attempt. The first thing, therefore, attempted by the P. of Orange,
after the revolution, was a toleration which he carried for the dissenters;
and, though not for the Roman Catholics, yet all his reign he gave them
a connivance equivalent to a toleration.</P>
<P>This P. Vaudemont told general Dillon, who told it to ME, and to
many others, as the chevalier Glascock, abbé Dunne, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>James was a stranger to the intrigues formed against him at the
court of Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> He was too devout a son of the church, to suppose
that the holy father would conspire with his enemies, to deprive him of
his throne. His ignorance continued, after his flight from England;
and when he was preparing for his expedition into Ireland, he sent colonel
Porter, a gentleman of his bedchamber, as his envoy extraordinary to
Innocent the Eleventh. The substance of his instructions, which were
dated at St. Germains, the 4th of February, 1689, is here subjoined.</P>
<P>“PORTER was required to testify to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> James's profession of,
and attachment to, the catholic faith: to represent that the protes∣tant
princes were alarmed at its progress upon his accession: that they
are united in a league to stop that progress, and had engaged catholic
princes to join them. He was desired to beseech his Holiness to bring
about a peace between the Emperor and his most Christian Majesty: to
<PB N="303" REF="321"/>
represent the advantages of their reconciliation to James, and to the ca∣tholic
religion: that James was dethroned on account of his religion:
that the present war is a religious war; witness the persecution of R. Ca∣tholics,
and the profanation and destruction of their churches in Eng∣land.
Porter was directed to cultivate the friendship of certain car∣dinals.”</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Waldgrave was created lord Waldgrave by James 2d on
the 20th January, 1686. He married the lady Henrietta, natural
daughter of that prince, by Mrs. Arabella Churchill, Sister to John
duke of Marlborough. He retired into France, on the accession of Wil∣liam
III.; and until his death, which happened in the latter end of this
year, was firmly attached to the fortune of his father-in-law. He lived
with the Queen at St. Germains, and carried on the negociations of
James's ministers with Versailles and Rome.</P>

<P>“THERE is only Derry holds out, which I hope shall now soon be
reduced, though they are very obstinate, expecting aids from
England, which we hope they are not in a condition to send. However
it is most certain, that since all the nobility at that mock-court have ta∣ken
the names of regiments, they will get men enough, and if they be
not prevented they will come hither.”</P>
<P>Melfort refers lord Waldgrave to a memorial he had presented to the
French ambassador on this subject. He desires him to communicate the
state of James's affairs to his foreign ministers, especially the cardinal
duke, that he might let the Pope know the truth of all, and convince
him, that he is imposed on by the faction of Spain.</P>
<P>“The parliament,” he continues, “sat down yesterday, and will do
all the King asks of them; and he will do for them what is fit for them.
I am sorry to hear from—, that there are clouds arising against me.
I never deserved them. They are none of the King's friends. I knew

the long run, I doubt that will hardly be thought for his service. I must
not press you to tell me any thing of this matter. But, if you could, you
would much oblige me.”</P>
<P>Lewis the XlVth is supposed to have behaved with generosity to
James in his distress, and though he only meant in the beginning to fo∣ment
divisions in Britain and make Charles and James the instruments of
his ambitious designs, it is probable, that towards the end of his life, he
was sincerely attached to the exiled family, and desirous of replacing them
again on the throne. It does not even appear that he ever stipulated with
James, for any return for the great expences which he incurred in the
cause of that prince, unwilling perhaps, to add to his misfortunes by
doubting his gratitude.</P>
<P>But frequent mortifications are unavoidable in every state of depend∣ence.
Though James was not forced to purchase the friendship of his
benefactor with a cession of any part of his dominions, as has been
groundlessly supposed, he was obliged to grant extraordinary privileges to
the French subjects, and to distinguish them by peculiar marks of his
favour. The count D'Avaux, who followed him to Ireland as ambas∣sador
from Lewis, took the lead in all his councils. He seemed rather
to dictate than to advise; and James, scrupulously attentive to his com∣mands,
endeavoured, in the most submissive manner, to justify his con∣duct,
as appears from his answer to a memorial presented to him by that
minister.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“The answer made by the King's order to a Memorial presented by Count
D'Avaux,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 9.</NOTE> Ambassador extraordinary from France, the 4th of June,
1689.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“HIS Majesty being very sensible of the friendly and generous offices
of the most Christian King, thinks he cannot give too strong proofs
of the gratitude he endeavours to shew on all occasions, and particularly
in treating his ambassador extraordinary in a more distinguished manner
than any ambassador ever was, giving him chearfully such a reception,
<PB N="305" REF="323"/>
as may sufficiently convince the world of his esteem for the King his
master, caressing him always as his intimate friend, and considering him
as his most faithful councillor in his most secret affairs, which he ge∣nerally
communicated to him before he spoke of them to the duke of
Tyrconnel or to the earl of Melfort.</P>
<P>“His Majesty, upon his arrival in his kingdom of Ireland, communi∣cated
to the said ambassador extraordinary, the pain, that the disorder in
which he found the kingdom gave him; and in order to redress them,
having chosen a cabinet-council, the said ambassador was the first mem∣ber
of it, and was present at all the meetings. So that to this moment
he has had opportunities of giving his advice, which has been almost
generally followed. His Majesty, therefore, cannot comprehend what
reason the said ambassador had to present his memorial of the fourth of
June; in which he complains chiefly, that he hath made many pressing
instances for applying a speedy remedy to the dangers which threat∣ened,
&amp;c. not doubting but his Majesty considered the remedies which
might be applied against these threatening calamities in his secret cabinet∣council;
and as he is a stranger to what passes there, he cannot see but
with surprize, that nothing is done which might contribute to the re∣establishment
of his Majesty's affairs, and that even the security of his
person is neglected.</P>
<P>“In answer to this, James replied, that he was the first to discover these
disorders. That since he came to the kingdom, he considered by him∣self
and in his cabinet-council, the most effectual means of preventing
them. That the ambassador was always present in council, where he
either advised or consented to whatever passed, and could attest, that all
the orders which were given were as punctually executed as the present
circumstances would permit, the King having always placed them in the
hands of those who were nominated by the ambassador.</P>
<P>“The said ambassador alledges in his memorial, that it is unnecessary
to speak of what is past, as there is no time to apply a remedy. But, as
there is still time to punish those who are guilty of the faults or neglects
that have been committed, his Majesty not being able to guess what the
ambassador complains of, thinks it proper that he should explain himself
more clearly.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="324"/>
“D'Avaux said in his memorial, that there were clear and circumstantial
accounts from different quarters, that there were 10,000 protestants in
Dublin, who had arms, and who had written to the prince of Orange
for assistance, &amp;c. James answers, that he was the first who gave this
intelligence, and that d'Avaux would never have heard of it unless (he)
James had told it to him when he asked his advice, which he did re∣peatedly,
not only in council, but also at a private meeting, at which the
marquis de Rosen was present. It was then determined to disarm the
protestants, and to deliver up their arms and horses to the marquis de
Rosen in the presence of the ambassador. But on the evening before this
design was to be put in execution, James had certain intelligence, that
the presbyterians had sent letters to the prince of Orange. The intended
bearer of these letters who was his informer, knew their ring-leaders, who
might be all seized in a little time. James, who would never change
what was once determined in council without the consent of the ambassa∣dor,
consulted him on the subject of this information, in the presence of
the marquis de Rosen. They were both of opinion it was proper to delay
the execution of their design, until as many as possible of the guilty could
be seized. James, seeing that it would take up too much time to dis∣cover
them all, seized at the end of five or six days as many as were known
to be guilty; and as necessity obliged him to send the troops employed
in the search against the rebels of Inniskillin, he consulted the ambassador
about the means of continuing the search in de Rosen's absence: it was
agreed to employ a lieutenant general, the viscount de Mont-Cashel, on
that service, and the necessary orders were then given to him, though to
little purpose.</P>
<P>“The said ambassador complains that his Majesty was informed, that
the protestants had carried already and continued to carry away the effects
of the rebels, &amp;c. which should have been confiscated for his Majesty's
use, and knew that the sheriffs and others employed to search for these
effects, had allowed them to be conveyed away, for the sake of some
presents made to themselves. He alledges that this is a thing of so much
consequence to his Majesty's interests, that he humbly, entreated him
more than once, to arrange it in a proper manner, and had even pro∣posed
the means of doing so, but that nothing had been done as yet to
prevent this robbery.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="325"/>
“It is true, his Majesty has heard, that the effects, not of rebels, but
of such protestants as endeavoured to go over to England had been trans∣ported
to that country, and that that happened by the connivance
of some officers of the revenue, who are protestants and are settled in sea∣port
towns. His Majesty ordered them instantly to be discharged from
their employments, although there had been nothing proved against them,
nor any formal accusation given in of their crime; and his orders had
been executed so punctually by the commissioners of his revenue, on
whom these officers depend, that when the ambassador gave in his me∣morial
there remained but two or three of them in the kingdom. These
three were men of fidelity well known to the commissioners. All this
considered, his Majesty cannot conceive what the ambassador means by
this article in his memorial.</P>
<P>“As the. ambassador mentions the estates of rebels, from which his
Majesty might draw, by legal means, considerable sums, which he might
employ in paying his troops; and as he observes, with pain, that the most
Christian King will be dissatisfied when he learns, that his Majesty does
not avail himself of the succours which he has in his hands, and which
are as considerable as they are necessary in the present pressing exigencies of
his affairs; his Majesty would have the ambassador know, that according
to the laws of the country, these confiscations cannot be lawfully touched
by him or by his officers, but after a sentence passed by the ordinary
judges, or an act of parliament.” James gives reasons why neither the
one nor the other could be done at this time, and thence concludes,
“that the ambassador has been ill informed, when he believed that his
Majesty could have, before now, taken these confiscations in a lawful
manner.” James then acquaints D'Avaux, with the orders which he had
given to the sheriffs and to the commissioners of the customs, whom he had
appointed as commissaries in the different counties in the kingdom, to
make up an exact inventory of the estates, not only of rebels, but also of
absentees; “and that it was not in his power to do more until he could
take these estates in a lawful manner; being naturally averse to do any
thing contrary to the established laws of his kingdom, that would give
a handle to his enemies to justify their accusations of his arbitrary con∣duct,
<PB N="308" REF="326"/>
about which they made so much noise In his other kingdoms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and
he does not think it consistent with ordinary prudence in the present
state of his affairs.</P>
<P>“It is clearly proved by what hath been said above, that his Majesty
hath neglected nothing which he could lawfully do for preserving these
estates, and he does not recollect to have received any advice from the
ambassador on this subject, unless it was to appoint the Sieur Tuffereau,
commissary general for these estates; as if he alone, being a stranger to
the language and customs of the country, had been sufficient for an
office, which so many hundreds find a difficulty in executing.” James
assures D'Avaux, that the value of these estates had been exaggerated.
That they consisted entirely of cows, sheep, and some corn, for which
there were no purchasers. “These things being considered, his Majesty,
imagines, that the most Christian King, who has too good a judgment
not to know what should be done on these occasions, will be persuaded
that he avails himself of all the means in his hands, and will not blame
his actions, when he has considered them with that friendship and bene∣volence
which he has so generously shown upon all occasions.”</P>
<P>The rest of this memorial regards military operations, which D'Avaux
had condemned, and James endeavours to justify.</P>
<P>James's troops in Ireland had neither arms nor pay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a return of arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol.

Henry Earl of Dover, going by our Order to France.</HEAD>
<OPENER>JAMES R.</OPENER>
<P>SINCE the invasion of this our kingdom by the prince of Orange and
his adherents, has made us change the design we had of going imme∣diately
into England for that of preserving Ireland, you are to press our
dearest brother, the most Christian King, to send us immediately
twelve or fifteen thousand muskets or firelocks. The more firelocks
the better for our service.</P>
<P>You must press him for one thousand barrels of powder, with match and
musket ball in proportion, with handgranads and other things fitt for the
service, this kingdome being perfectly destitute of all things of that
kinde.</P>
<P>Thes, with a present supply of money, you must press for, as of im∣mediate
necessity; and that no time be lost, you must hav the armes
lying at Brest for our service dispatched without delay.</P>
<P>You must hav a considerable number of swords sent over, ther being
extream want of them amongst the forces; shabres, if you can get them,
are preferable; ther must be belts sent in proportion to them, and ban∣daliers
in proportion to the muskets and firelocks.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="328"/>
You must endeavour with all speed to procure to us six thousand foot
of the old troops of our dearest brother, without which our affairs hear
will be in great danger. For though we have a great number of men,
yet they are for the most part new and undisciplined, as well the officers
as the souldiours, and consequently will be unequally matche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the old
troops designed against us. But if that body of old men come, we have
no reason to fear the event; and you must hold forth the advantages this
will be off to the most Christian King, doing it seasonably; and the dan∣ger
ther may be in the delay. That thes very troops will serve as part
of what we expect at our going to England. Lett our dearest brother
kno, that all our interest depends upon this one step and the suda∣ness
of it, for all thes reasons you yourself can lay out, being so fully in∣formed
of this kingdom and all our affairs.</P>
<P>Thes men must hav ther officers, arms, touls, and train of artillery
with its officers, boats for a bridge, and all other things necessary for the
service.</P>
<P>You are not to use our former instructions, only to sho them to our
dearest consort the queen, by whoes orders and directions you are to
proceed in all things in our service.</P>
<P>You shall lykways sho them to our trusty and well-beloved Henry
lord Waldgrave our envoy extraordinary, by whom you shal be inform∣ed
of what may be fit for our service, and with whom you are to consult
concerning the best means speedily to obtain our desires, that being almost
of as great importance as the supplie in demand itself.</P>
<P>You are to insist on the recalling the marquis de Rosen, for the reasons
contained in our other instructions of the date of the 15th of July,
instant.</P>
<P>If you shal be certainly informed that the affair of Derry and Inniskillin
is over, or that we hav some other considerable advantage; in that case,
without other orders, you shall proceed upon our other instructions
with all the application imaginable.</P>
<P>That you send hither three courvols or other paquet boats immediately
after your arrival, that we may have boats on this side to send with ex∣presses
in case of need. That you remember to informe fully of the
mater of the wine, the wool, and the other customs, according to the
<PB N="311" REF="329"/>
memoir hearwith given with you of this date: in all which, you are to
doe what shall be best for you to obtaine our desires.</P>

and of our reign the fifth year.</P>

<DIV3>
<P>The instructions to which the King refers in the preceding paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 33.</NOTE> con∣tain
very particular directions. Lord Dover was to embark at Kinsale,
to wait on the queen immediately upon his arrival, and to obey her in∣structions.
He was to inform Lewis of the state of Ireland, and of the
difficulties which James had to overcome. “The reasons of delay
you have in the journal of this date, of which you are to make use, as
being the matter of fact which has passed since our arrival here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, page 216.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“The condition and nature of the arms come last from France, you
are to inform of, but so, that no offence may be taken by Mr. de
Louvois if he sent them, nor by any others of the ministers con∣cerned.”</P>
<P>James proceeds to mention the reasons, with which lord Dover was
to endeavour to persuade Lewis to send him a fleet and troops, in order
to invade England and make a diversion in Scotland. He marks the
quantity of arms, stores, amunition, &amp;c. which he wanted; sets forth his
need of money and the advantage of sending him an immediate supply, and
the necessity of sending it, on account of the loss which his Majesty must
unavoidably sustain from the circulation of coppertickets, which was only
a temporary expedient to satisfy his creditors, by some acknowledgement
of the debt he owed them.</P>
<P>He desires lord Dover “to make his principal application to the mar∣quis
de Louvois, and to answer every thing that may be objected
against us or any thing we have done, especially in our behaviour to
the French officers our dearest brother the most Christian King sent
us, and all others of that nature, of which you have memorials and lists
given you herewith, by, which you will see how much we have pre∣ferred
them on all occasions to our own subjects.”</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="330"/>
He then desires lord Dover to inform Lewis of his indulgence to the
French subjects in the articles of trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> particularly in exporting wool and
importing wine.</P>
<P>“You are to endeavour with all the softness imaginable to have our
dearest brother recall the marquis de Rosen, as one, after having done
what he did at Londonderry, incapable to serve us usefully; you are to
inform, if need be, of his contemning our protections, by ordering to
drive in and starve not only those who lived peaceably at home, but
likewise those who were protected by us; so that no promises will be
believed from him, nor indeed from our officers, till the truth of this
affair be known by the rebels. At Inniskillin they are become more
numerous by much, every body running there for shelter from so un∣just
a violence. You shall shew how he required to be recalled, if this
his project was not followed, and how he offered himself garant of the
treaty with the town, and that if any violation of it happened he would
put himself on their side; the which procedure of his there was no∣thing
but the consideration of his most Christian Majesty could have
made us suffer from him; and therefore, since we will not vindicate our
justice by punishing of him, we must show our dislike of his pro∣cedure
by having him recalled.”</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Dublin Castle, <DATE>August 10, 1689.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HIS Majesty has laid the affairs this express comes for so fully before
you, that it is but little I have to add to it. Some time ago the
French ambassador gave a memorial to the King, of things that the King
his master advised the King to do; and amongst other things this was one,
to cease the siege of Derry if there was no likelihood of taking it. These
things the King was still inclined to, and therefore, did still deliberate
how to execute them, and so, thought all were of opinion the siege was to
be ceased, yet none was so much of that mind, as that it was fit to be
done then, nor indeed before we had news that the English were just
<PB N="313" REF="331"/>
landing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and then all with one consent were of the same mind. You must
know that I told you this, because the French ambassador and monsieur
de Rosen are still laying all the blame on the King, for not following
their advice as they say, whilst nothing in the world is more true, than
that he still followed all that was practicable of it; and that for Rosen he
never would give any, though the King has asked it many and many a
time from him. Nor had the King the power to make him take the
command of Derry on him, nor the ordering of any thing of that siege
by no order he could send to him, as you will see by the King's letters
to him and his in return, which I send you the copies of for your in∣formation.</P>
<P>He has done the King much harm. For if he had let the Protestants
alone who were protected, their party at Inniskillin had not been so strong
as it now is. But for what's past it is in vain to talk to you of it, nor
to tell you the blame thrown on the two Hamiltons, or the diffidence the
natives have of them. All we must look to now, is what's to come, and
that depends on what the King of France will do. Let him send us quickly
what he has to send us, especially men and arms, for these two would
serve us. Send as many arms as possibly you can, and believe there is
no want of raw men to be found here, if we had but some old troops to
show them how to do well. Haste is all, and the King is so pressing to
dispatch this, that I have not time to say the thousandth part of what I
would say if I had time. The journal as it is I have sent to you, and by
the next you shall have it more perfect.</P>
<P>I have time to add no more, but wonder we hear nothing from you
since Porter came. We think there is some fault. But when we con∣sider
that the ways may be stopt, we must have patience. The King was
never better in his health. God send him to be long so I am, with
all my heart,</P>

<P>WE have yours of the 31st of August, and another to my lord Melfort,
with a full account of the audiences of my lord Dover, whom we
hope shortly to see here, and by him be informed of the succours we ex∣pect
thence, which for their own interest as well as ours ought to be
hastened, that we may soon quench the flame which Schomberg's landing
in this kingdom hath kindled here. For although God has blessed our
councils and endeavours already beyond our expectation, and we find
them so well seconded by our loyal subjects here, that we are persuaded
we shall hinder its spreading out of that corner of the North where it is
now fixed; yet time is precious, and it may be conjectured out of Schom∣berg's
conduct, that his instructions were either to take a present possession
of the kingdom, (of which he had some hopes at his arrival,) or to pro∣tract
the war in it, and keep it out of England by that means, which must
in the sequel be the ruin of this kingdom too; for it being already
impoverished, it will by a lasting war with two armies in the bowels of
it be quite consumed. Wherefore it is of great consequence that this
war be speedily ended, as well for the preservation of this kingdom as the
transportation of it into England, whilst our friends there are in heart.
With that intention having gathered together as good an army as ever
was seen here, and as well provided as possible, finding in both officers
and soldiers a resolution for God, ourselves, and their country, and an
earnest desire to be brought to the enemy; on the 6th of September, we
came with them within three miles of Dundalk, where Schomberg lies
encamped. Since which time we have often offered him occasions of
battle. We have omitted nothing that might provoke him to it by ex∣cursions
of parties to his out gaurds, by forraging near his camp, and con∣suming
with sire what we could not transport; yet he continues within
<PB N="315" REF="333"/>
his trenches without accepting a battle or even a fair skirmish, although his
parties have been often much superior in number to ours. Thus much,
that you may understand our present condition, which is such as we may
hope to hold out much longer than till November, the time designed for
our succours, which you may so represent, as not to slacken the ministers
of that court in dispatching them as if they were not necessary; but
to hasten them, by shewing them how easy it is to chase Schomberg out
of this country, which would open a door for our return to England;
and by this, break that formidable league against France, and lay the
corner stone of a lasting peace in Christendome. [<HI>A passage in unintelli∣gible

<P>The frigate called La Jollie, commanded by captain Nangle, is leaky
and unfit to keep the sea this winter season. Deal with Monsieur Seignelay
for another frigate of the same bigness, but stronger and finer for winter
service; and get his consent for changing the captains, that Nangle may
remain with the other frigate, and the captain of it return with the Jollie.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received your lordship's, by my lord Dover, who tells me, that
he has given your lordship an account of the disposition of this court,
with relation to Ireland. But, however, it being my duty, and I having
been present at the audience he has had of the ministers, I will give your
lordship an account of what I have heard and of what I can guess. The
first audience he had was of Mons. de Louvois, to whom he delivered a
copy of the demands contained in the second instruction. Mons de
Louvois told him, he had already seen it, being sent by Mons. D'Avaux;
and that my Lord could say nothing to him which could encrease the
opinion he had of the great consequence of preserving Ireland, and of the
danger, if it were not succoured. But that the present posture of their
affairs was such, that they could not spare any men, till the end of Octo∣ber;
and that they had not arms or ammunition ready, their magazines
being exhausted, what was sent into Ireland already being the very remnants;
so that it would require time to get together any quantity. That in
case Mons. de Schomberg should land, he hoped the King would be
able to defend himself, till the beginning of November; and that then he
should not want assistance. I cannot see how they could refuse 6000
men, considering the good posture of their affairs; but much less, why
they refuse a small quantity of arms. My lord Dover having begged,
that, if they could not send the quantity desired, they should at least send
what they had ready, every thousand arms being a thousand men to the
King. They had a warm dispute about the lies, that were written by
many of the French in Ireland; Lord Dover demonstrating plainly the
impossibility of doing better, considering the desolation of the country;
and that many of the employments, which were said to be ill-executed,
as relating to the money, commissaries for the army, &amp;c. were executed
by Frenchmen. Mons. de Louvois did answer, that he was sensible of
<PB N="317" REF="335"/>
the difficulties in a country destroyed by civil war, and where the me∣thod
of arms and sieges being new, few had any experience in their em∣ployments.
But that he was convinced, that no industry was used to
obviate these difficulties. That, whensoever a cart was not to be found
with horses, the artillery or baggage stood for want of industry to get
cows or oxen. Then when any the least screw was broke of any of the
arms, there was no care to have a smith to mend them. That the
French, who had executed their employments ill, as I think, especially
some of the commissaries were said to have done, were not recom∣mended
from hence, and it was the fault of those who admitted them, as
I remember, lord Dover did say, that they were recommended by Mons.
D'Avaux. The King of France has been since with the Queen; and
has said the same as Mons. de Louvois, as to the time of sending into
Ireland. But he seemed more ready to believe my lord Dover, con∣cerning
the management of affairs there. They are very ready to recal
Rozen. But I doubt much, whether they are not sorry Lausun is sent
in his place; it being only yielded to (as I believe) because the King has
writ so earnestly for him, and that many, who do not love him, are
glad to send him out of the way. I have been told, by those who are
most affectionate to the King's service, that whenever he has had power,
he has been so insupportably imperious and haughty, that it was impos∣sible
to live with him; and that, since he was so with his own master, it
is to be feared he will be worse when he finds himself and the succours
he commands necessary. Besides, it is so long since he has been in an
army, that he must have forgot much of the method of war; and cer∣tainly
his imprisonment and life since have taken away that vigour and
activity, necessary to command a raw army. He has shewed so much ill-humour
about this matter, that I have almost fallen out with him about
it. The first two or three days, after lord Dover's arrival, he told us,
that he would not go, unless he were made a duke. When he begun
to be cool enough to consider, that such a capitulation would send him
again to prison, he said he would go; but told me, particularly, that, if
there were a man, to whom he wished the greatest plague he could in∣vent,
it should be to be in his circumstances, and to be sent into Ireland.
That he was grown old, and desired quiet; and, instead of that, un∣dertook
a desperate business; only fit for somebody who had neither re∣putation,
nor interest, nor quiet, nor any thing else to lose. I believe no
<PB N="318" REF="336"/>
general in France but would have been ambitious to restore the King,
and to venture their lives in such a cause. He intends to stay to go with
the men, because he will take better care to have every thing necessary.
He is very ill with Mons. de Louvois. But I hope the latter is so good
a servant to his master, that he will not oppose any thing out of a private
pique. I was glad to find, that lord Dover was so well received at this
court, because Mons. D'Avaux had writ, that, after the sea-sight, he
seemed to be sorry for the victory, and turned it into ridicule; so that
the King of France took notice of it to the Queen, and the ministers to
me. But he has wrote since, in such a manner, as lord Dover has been
received with great kindness.</P>
<P>The bills of exchange, drawn upon me, were taken at Chester, as I
perceive, by a letter I have had from James Grimes, in which he desires
me to find some other way to send money; and that he thinks the ordi∣nary
way of returning by merchants dangerous. I have already informed
your lordship, that I have spoke to Mons. de Croissy, who told me he
had received a letter from your lordship, on that subject; and had ac∣cordingly
spoke to the King of France, who answered, that he had al∣ready
given 2000 pistoles, which he believed had not been spent as was
designed, since they were for printing papers, and sending intelligence
into Ireland; and he was informed by Mons. D'Avaux, that the King
had very little intelligence from his friends in England.</P>
<P>I have spoke since, but found less hope since the war is likely to be
carried into Ireland. Whereas, if the war could have been carried into
England, it would have been of such invincible necessity, that it must
have been madness to have refused it. I have also informed your lord∣ship,
that I went to Mons de Metz Garde du Tresor Royal; and told
him, that he knew very well, that I had received 50,000 livres for the
month the King was here. That I had not any notice from the King,
at his departure, that I was not to receive the whole sum; and, there∣fore,
I believed, he expected I should do it, and return into Ireland what
was above the Queen's proportion. He told me, that the comptroller
general had ordered him to pay me only 21,000 livres a month; and
that the King had left his orders concerning the rest. I asked him, whe∣ther
the rest passed through his hands, and to whom he paid it, to be
returned into Ireland. But could not get any light, by his answer. Upon
<PB N="319" REF="337"/>
which, I desired Mons. de Lausun to speak with the comptroller general,
who told him the King had left his orders, and would not give him any
account.</P>
<P>While James was endeavouring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> in vain, to force Schomberg to fight,
he sent Lord Melfort to France, to enquire into the success of lord Do∣ver's
negociations, and to convince Lewis the XIV. and his ministers of
the facility and advantage of making a diversion in England.—Melfort
wrote the following letters upon his arrival in France.</P>

<OPENER>May it please your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>SINCE my last to your Majesty, we have had many accounts of suc∣cess
you have had; and we have only wanted the confirmation of
so good news, to give us a joy we have now been long strangers to.
God Almighty grant, that it be true, and your Majesty's most just and
righteous cause may prosper, to the ruin of your enemies.</P>
<P>After I had given my first accounts here to the ministers and to the
King himself, and touched on some things I had found your Majesty
most blamed for, I was not willing to press any farther, till I should,
learn how what I had said relished; and, for this end, I employed my
friends at court to get me notice of the different sentiments. I was not
long of finding, that the King was satisfied, and saw, that before he had
not been rightly informed, neither by D'Avaux nor lord Dover, of the
<PB N="320" REF="338"/>
state of Ireland, either before your Majesty came to it or since; and
that, not finding things so desperate, he begun to be of the opinion,
that the help he gave would not be lost. The ministers pretended to be
so well satisfied with the answers I had given to what your Majesty was
accused of, and what was laid to my charge, that every one told me what
they had been informed of, and so gave me the occasion to vindicate all;
a matter not hard to do, for one so much conversant in the whole matter.
On the main, I found the calumnies to come from the ambassador, Ro∣sen,
and some of the French officers, on the one hand; and from a knot
of Irish on the other, who reside here at Paris. As for the French, all
I could do was, to answer them. I did it fully, in ways not worthy
troubling your Majesty with. But as for the Irish, I made it my busi∣ness
to find out their malice, as well as the ways they took to execute it.
I soon found, that the fountain of this here was one bishop Malone, who,
some time ago, being pressed to go to Ireland, had refused, and being
put to it, declared, that he was entrusted at the court of France by
duke Tyrconnel, and for the clergy and nobility of Ireland, and conse∣quently
could not go. This he drew up in a paper, and was resolved to
have presented it to the Queen. But some of his countrymen, more wise
than he, it seems, prevented it. This I had from one of that kingdom,
who saw the paper.</P>
<P>This man, pretending so odd an ambassade, has a secret correspond∣ence
and access to the ministers, as I am informed, to whom he shews
letters of correspondence from Ireland of a most abominable strain; espe∣cially
three (after which I now hunt), wherein the great things done in
that kingdom before your Majesty's coming there are fully set out; and
how you had, by the advice of ill councillors, ruined all the good order
you found in it, and hindered duke Tyrconnel's designs. I was almost
despairing to find any of these so true, as that I might build upon them,
when the Queen was pleased to tell me, that she had got the last of them
from that bishop himself, a good luck I could not hope for. I begged
it; and, though she could not give me the original, till she had
spoken to the bishop, yet she has promised me a copy of it, by which
I shall more fully know what is said, and be better able to vindicate your
Majesty here, and be able to find out the person from whom it was, sent;
which I think is of the last importance to your Majesty's honour, to have
<PB N="321" REF="339"/>
him punished, with all the rigour the laws civil or military, if an offi∣cer,
will allow of; and I must conjure your Majesty, though I know it
needless in this matter, where your honour and reputation in this coun∣try
is concerned, not to have compassion on him, nor have regard either
to his relations or any thing else; but have him punished so, as the world
may see he was a calumniator of his King: a crime merits more deaths
than that ill man has hairs. For it is by such, that more ill has been
said of your Majesty's royal person and proceedings, than it were decent
for me to repeat; and, by having this end of the cord, your Majesty
may pluck out all the accomplices of so wicked a fact, and learn why
they came to be guilty of it. Their accomplishes here are as many al∣most
as there are of Irish. For all have seen, and either carried about
copies of these letters, or trumpeted their contents about; but there are
two more guilty than the rest, viz. O'Farrel, a lawyer, and another law∣yer
besides the bishop. I am confident the Queen sends your Majesty
the original paper. I shall endeavour to take off all the impressions that
and such like have given, in which, hitherto, I have neither been idle
nor unsuccessful. I confess, I found, amongst the generality, a strange
change. But it begins to clear up, and every day will more and more,
by the assistance of Almighty God.</P>
<P>One point in your Majesty's instructions I had not insisted on, as I
told your Majesty in my last, because the Queen would first think of it
amongst her Majesty, lord Waldgrave, and myself. This, at least, she
did, upon the repeated news of success your Majesty had had. The
point was, for assistance to go to England or Scotland; and, besides, the
advices from England were so many spurs to haste her on to it; at least,
the fear was, it should be looked on as a new proposition, and she or we
looked on as inconstant, and might hinder the succours promised. This
I over-ruled, and so was ordered to go on with it, when the Queen went
to Chaliot, and the court to Fountainbleau.—At Chaliot, Mr. de Lou∣vois
came to visit her, and told her, that it would be fit to send me to
Fountainblieu for hastening on the succours. She told him, that was
agreed on already; and I could do no more. However, he said, I was
one would be welcome to every body, and my very face would hasten
them, and keep them in mind. The Queen sent for me, and told me
this before my lord Waldgrave; so we took up the matter of going into
<PB N="322" REF="340"/>
England again, and concluded it was fit to propose it; but so as that it
might not come as a new thing. So I was ready to go Thursday last.
On Wednesday, the Queen sent for me, and told me she had altered her
mind. Mr. de Lausun had been there, and she thought it would be to
no purpose to propose that matter at this time. I let her Majesty see,
that it was so to be done as not to be a new thing. That it was of im∣portance
to your Majesty, to know their opinion, and what you had to
rely on, and so begged the manner might be left to me, which she was
pleased to agree to; and so I went on Friday. Saturday, I met with M.
de Louvois, and discoursed long with him of the state of Ireland. I
shewed him what the condition of it was at your Majesty's arrival there;
the difficulties you had to encounter, and the little help; the poverty of
the country, and the threatening wants, through the licencious plunder∣ing
of the inhabitants, and destroying the stocks of the protestants; and
that the best corn country of Ireland either was entirely waste, or the
seat of the war. That, from these, and the want of money, which would
infallibly be so soon as they came to be in greater quantity, than the or∣dinary
stock of money current in the kingdom. That all these things
make it evident, that Ireland cannot be long kept, without constant and
vast supplies.</P>
<P>That your Majesty went to Ireland only in your way to Britain; and
that the door there was open, so soon as any considerable party was ready
to join with your Majesty. So that, whenever that happened, you did
never question the assistance of the most Christian King for your return
thither. That your Majesty had all the moral certainties imaginable to
believe, that England was now in those circumstances; and that, there∣fore,
this was the time to provide for your Majesty's transportation and
succour. That it was the interest of France, and good <HI>menagerie,</HI> to
do soon what must be done at last, after a vast loss of time and expences,
with more uncertainty. That there still would be danger, and there still
must be an army to go, and a fleet to carry it. That there never could
be a greater disproportion betwixt the fleets on the French side; and
that this was the season they could best send their troops, and least fear
any other enemy at sea than wind and weather. A copy of all these ar∣guments,
at length, I shall send your Majesty. This he himself intro∣duced,
by asking, what I thought would be the event of any advantage
<PB N="323" REF="341"/>
your Majesty could get in Ireland. I told him, that, if it were not
followed by further attempts, whilst the one party were hearty, and the
other in fear, it would have no other effect than to hasten your ruin; and
that, by the forces they would send against your Majesty in the spring:
and that, in all probability, it would need more assistance to preserve Ire∣land,
than it would do now to gain England; and so went on. By this
means, it came to be no new proposition, nor did he look on it as such.</P>
<P>He told me, the men would be no great difficulty; the horses would;
but that the greatest was the fleet. That, if the English kept out all they
had this summer, as was reported, it was not possible for them to keep
out so many.</P>
<P>I told him, that it was not possible for the English to keep out their
great ships this winter. That many of their other ships were so ill built,
and of green timber, that they would not be able to keep the seas in this
rough weather; but, however, that the same difficulty occurred for the
6000 already condescended on; all which was out of dispute, and what
could safely carry them would need but small addition to secure the
rest.</P>
<P>He said, that was not all. Ships to transport the horse and dragoons
must be provided, and that would take time; and that a small number
of ships not embarrassed with a convoy would be too hard for a far
greater number of ships with a convoy. I told him, though I was not
seaman enough to answer all these objections; yet I remember it was
not thought so by the seamen, when the King had the prince of Orange
to oppose. He told me, that the great difficulty yet remained; which
was, that, in case of ill weather, they were masters of no port on the
coast. I told him, that to me appeared the easiest: for that moment
your Majesty set foot in England, you would be master of the best port
in it; and then, what with it, Ireland, and the coast of France, they
would be in a better condition than the English themselves, when that
port was taken from them. He said, that he wished it were in their
power to do this; but he did not think it possible for them. However,
I was glad he would discourse of it: a thing he could not be brought to
before, by letters.</P>
<P>He complained to me of lord Dover grievously, for quarrelling him
in his own house; and saying, that, if the French intended to fell their
<PB N="324" REF="342"/>
wars so dear, he was not come for that end. He says, that he told him,
that the lord Dover had taken himself to quarrelling, at which he was
very unskilful; and so they parted that time. That lord Dover had ex∣cused
that matter afterwards; but that he told him freely, that at this
court there needed a great practice and experience of affairs, and a good
temper, not to be soon found out, and to make their matters go well on.
That, afterwards, speaking of the affairs of Ireland, lord Dover said,
there were disorders; but he was going back, and would take care to see
all put right; at which Mr. de Louvois laught much, and told the King
of France, Ireland was now secure, lord Dover was to take the govern∣ment
on him. These are things I expected not from lord Dover; for
your Majesty may remember, that he told you, one cause of your affairs
going ill was, that I did not carry as I ought to Mr. de Louvois. To
me he was all kindness, and told me all the time, the comte de Lausun
and others said all the ills of me. He had still said, that if I had done
ten times worse, yet I was the only man about your Majesty he had ever
converted with capable of serving in these stations I was in. This I only
tell your Majesty, to shew how far my coming has changed the talk here;
and, indeed, I think there was a good providence in it, in relation to your
Majesty's affairs; for it is not conceivable the villainous reports they
had spread abroad. And, indeed, matters go too far, when subjects will
raise their reputation upon the ruin of that of their sovereign; yea, that
they dare connive at others doing it for them. Of these sorts of intelli∣gences
there has been too many.</P>
<P>I find too, that Mr. de Lausun is no ways satisfied with my lord Do∣ver's
conduct here, and thinks he was no ways fit to have been sent;
and Mr. de Louvois told me, that he had said to his master, that he
pitied your Majesty, for having been reduced to the necessity of sending
such a man. For his part, when he met with such men in business, he
knew no remedy but to go and sleep.</P>
<P>But to return to the other affair. I spoke fully to Mr. de Seignelay,
and found him more averse from hazarding the fleet than Mr. de Lou∣vois
had been, and make the difficulties insuperable for this season. I
pressed him on it, as far as I thought reasonable then; having a mind
not to put him out of patience, so as that I might have room to begin
again at the court's return; and indeed I durst not press, least having
<PB N="325" REF="343"/>
taken the thing upon myself, any ill answer had been given, and I
blamed. On Sunday morning, I made the Queen's compliment to the
King, and thought to have said no more, but just to put him in mind,
that the time was near in which he had promised to send the succours
into Ireland. But he entered in discourse of the whole matter, and ex∣pressed
all the kindness and all the respect imaginable to your Majesty
and to the Queen; gave me again an account of the assiette of his af∣fairs;
and said, that he will not only do what he finds difficult, but if
there be a possibility he desires no more, and said, that it was so much
his own interest, that he was not to be suspected in the matter. That
Louvois had told him, that we had had a long discourse together on your
Majesty's affairs; and that, if there remained any possibility of doing
what I had proposed, in relation to your Majesty's passage into England,
he would do it. But that, if by any accident he came to lose his fleet,
your Majesty's affairs would be desperate, and his in an ill condition.
That he knew he was blamed, for not fighting the enemy this summer;
but that, I knew it, things were never represented as they truely were:
for he did not think the state of the enemy so bad as it really was. And
that, I knew well, some years ago, it would have been looked on as ex∣travagant,
to say, France could have coped with any of the two sea
powers; and now, though he confessed it was not the same brave English,
but a company of rebels, yet both the powers were united against him.
That, if he came to fight on the coast of England, and had (as it could
not be otherwise) any disabled ships, not having a port near, all these
must be necessarily lost. I told him, that, if it only stood at that, your
Majesty's landing in England secured him one of the best, if not more.
He said, he was afraid that might harm your business in England. I
told him, that, if your Majesty did not go to England in a condition
above these precautions, you could not think to succeed. At that, he
seemed to be pleased; so I told him, that, one time or other, this must
fall out; and doing it in time, would save much time, money, and
blood; and I did not doubt, that if he did apply himself to it, he would
find ways to overcome the most difficult steps that lay in the way; and
to think of it soon would give the more time for the preparations. He
said, that, as for what concerned the 6000 men, he had taken his mea∣sures;
and that the regiments were named, and should soon be at Brest,
<PB N="326" REF="344"/>
tho' he durst not let know which they were, lest the ill opinion was here
of the Irish affairs might occasion them to run away; so he must bring
them by other ways: that he would, in all things, do his utmost for
your Majesty's interest; and a great deal more to this purpose.</P>
<P>Upon this whole matter, seeing there is no body in the world knows
so much of the sea affairs as your Majesty does, it may be fit that your
Majesty should write to the most Christian King, on this subject, your∣self;
and give him your opinion, how this matter may be done, and send
your letter to the Queen, to see if it quadrates with the circumstances
your Majesty's affairs may be in when it comes; and this, so much the
rather, that I have the little seal for sealing, and she will be sure to
make the best use of what your Majesty shall so write; and, if there
be any thing to add to what I have said on the subject, your Majesty
would be pleased to send it; and, in the mean time, I shall still be going
on, as far as it is possible for me here, in conjunction with my lord
Waldegrave, whose health obliges him to go and pass the winter in the
warmer climate.</P>
<P>I hope he gives your Majesty an account, that he and I live in that
perfect understanding your Majesty desires; and, if ever it should be
otherwise, I shall look on myself as most unfortunate.</P>
<P>The foreign news I leave entirely to my lord Waldegrave, and the
Queen has all the papers from England, except this, which I send to
your Majesty; in which, you will see the true humour of Scotland, and
that what I foretold the D. Hamilton is true; that where one grumbled
at me, there would be a hundred open clamours against him, if ever he
came to have any hand in the government.</P>
<P>Your Majesty will likewise see there, the bravery of Cannon and the
other Scotch officers, who must have some sort of relief, if your Ma∣jesty
thinks fit, considering the inconveniency of sending any part of
what lands once in Ireland. The Queen may demand something to be
sent immediately to Scotland, without touching at Ireland; and this to
be done so soon as the rest is gone from Brest. Some arms, ammuni∣tion,
and some money must be had. It were pity so many brave men
should perish without assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="345"/>
I confess I am in pain for their wants, though not so much as for
these I know your Majesty must needs have where you are, considering
how little ammunition was left; and, for that end, I begged of the in∣tendant
to hasten what was ordered to go with all speed. But I find all
stays to go with my lord Dover, and he stays for the Soleil d'Affrique,
which is to relieve the Jollie, and is not yet come from Rochfort. In∣deed
this was not right; but, as I informed your Majesty in my last,
lord Dover gave all so much for lost, and had convinced all here so
much of it, that I found he had no great mind to go back: for he said
publickly at the table, the best could befall him was to be taken by
the way and carried to England: he had friends there, and the prince
of Orange would be kind to him. This he said to the duchess of Powis,
and pretended to be angry when the act of attainder was against us,
(proposed, for it did not pass) that he had not writt into England, to
inform that he was not in Ireland; the attainder going only against
such as were there in arms, as they called it. These things are foolish.
At present, I am doing all I possibly can to hasten on the succours; and
I will leave no stone unturned to obtain your passage into England: for
the more I see from thence, the more I find of reason for your Majesty's
hazarding there.</P>
<P>The matter of intelligence has been managed here by Mr. Innis and
his correspondents, all depending on the care of Sir Robert Clerk, whose
concern for your royal interest is above what I am able to express; and,
indeed, without him and his correspondent, author of this long letter I
send you, there would be nothing here, but storys one can make nothing
of, nor any way rely upon.</P>
<P>This correspondent, whose name I know not, your Majesty will find
by his writings to be an intelligent man, and much knowing in all the
affairs, especially those of Scotland; and that comes from his great fa∣miliarity
with Scalmorly, Sir James Montgomery, and, by his means,
this man has had the influence to raise many a broil amongst them, and
is still raising more.</P>
<P>This correspondence must be entertained; and that cannot be with∣out
money: for the persons concerned have not whereon to live. This
must be soon too, and I thought it might have been supplied from the
29,000 pounds your Majesty received for yourself, of the 50,000 was
<PB N="328" REF="346"/>
given for your entertainment. But, upon discourse with my lord Wald∣grave,
I find he could not get the ministers to let him know what they
resolved in that matter; nor to explain whether it was paid or not, or
whether it was to be paid at all. This is unlucky; but it must be
known; for it is of importance, that distinction be made of what is for
your entertainment, and what for the war; yet so as no exception can
be taken at the demand. The difference I take to be this, that what is
given for entertainment, your Majesty may dispose of for such ends as
you shall think fit; and, indeed, I think your Majesty will need a con∣siderable
part of it to live on, and for the assistance of such as are like
to starve in gaols in England upon your Majesty's account, and some
part of it must go for such intelligence, as they would starve; for they
believe none but their own, and all these are refugees and fanaticks, who
write all the whig news they can pick up. This will not do your busi∣ness.
Besides, some person must be sent to give an account of your Ma∣jesty's
affairs, lest they, who all pretend to skill in the politicks, make
judgment on the wrong notions they have; and so believe, that your
Majesty would be incapable of relieving them, tho' you come back: so
ill an opinion have they of your conduct; and so little they know the
condition of your affairs. As for example, all who come from England
rail against me as a traitor and a Sunderland, or worse, if that can be;
because that I durst not come into England myself; and, therefore, had
hindered your Majesty from coming, tho' you had arms enough, 15,000
French all this summer in the army, 700,000<HI>l.</HI> sterling money from
France, and the command of their whole fleet. I confess, had this been
so, I must have been worse than they can conceive of me, if I had been
against your Majesty's going. But, as foolish as this is, it is universally
believed; and, therefore, there must be a way of true intelligence found,
which I am now upon, both directly from England to your Majesty, and
by this.</P>
<P>Fergus Graham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brother to the lord Preston.</NOTE>, being come over here, will be the fit man to be
the first informer of the true state of your affairs; and how much your
Majesty deserves the praise of all the world for your conduct in Ireland,
instead of being reproached. I thought to have sent Tempest first; but
he will not look so disinterested as the other, who came fraught with com∣plaints
<PB N="329" REF="347"/>
against me, and is now fully satisfied of the folly of them, and
all the things they so fully believe in England. Besides, he is a fit man
to take a farm, or find a farmer on the sea coast, for laying down of
letters. If he think better to go to Ireland, I will send Mr. Tempest
only to lord Preston and that gang; for there are several gangs who trust
not one another; and all these must be managed separately, according
to their tempers and desires, and what is possible to be done must be to
keep them in heart; and yet not make them believe what we are sure
cannot be performed; for, at the long run, such things does infinite
harm.</P>
<P>The next matter of great importance, is the management of this new
Pope, who, they say, is entirely for France. He gained, but by one
vote, to be elected; and all the French cardinals voted for him: so he
owes his election to them, and the duke de Chaunes is his most intimate
friend. They lived long in one house together; and that duke was in∣structed
to stand for him, though none of the other parties imagined it;
and he being a Venetian, is of a state has most generously espoused your
Majesty's interest, and put affronts on the resident the prince of Orange
would have sent, and has continued yours, in possession of your Ma∣jesty's
right; and, it's said, that it was this Ottoboni who, before the
election, proposed, that a considerable part of the money found with
the old Pope's treasurers, should be employed for your Majesty's resto∣ration.
Most certain it is, that he has begun to compliment France,
and has assured the ambassador of all the bulls now wanting for France;
and the most Christian King has presented him with Avignon. So that
I hope God will smile again on your Majesty's affairs, from that rigid
corner from which so many of your misfortunes spring.</P>
<P>The distance your Majesty is at, made me advise the Queen to make
your excuse, and to send her compliments early, and to begin to lay your
Majesty's condition at his Holiness' feet; and I myself have made bold
to write to the cardinals d'Este and Norfolk. These letters, whereof I
have sent copies inclosed, that your Majesty may see what I do; in which,
if I do amiss, your Majesty will pardon a zeal that cannot let slip any
occasion of serving you, which my conscience convinces me is for the
best; and I shall go on with this, till I have your Majesty's commands
in the matter, and your own letters, which may either be done there, or
<PB N="330" REF="348"/>
the inclosed copy followed and signed by your Majesty, and sent back
open to me, as you shall please to order, together with these to the car∣dinals.
But I am yet to see the ministers here; and shall lay all before
your Majesty, in the best method I can, before this express is dis∣patched.</P>
<P>There are some four or five hundred Irish officers and soldiers come
to Lisle, from Hambourgh, through all imaginable difficulties, till they
came to the duke of Lorraine's army; who told them, if they said they
were to serve in France, he must put them in prison: but, if they were
to go and serve their own King, he would give them all passes. So
they said they were to go to your Majesty to serve you; and he not only
gave them passes, but money to bear their expences: a thing so generous
as deserves your royal thanks; and, indeed, it has gained him more
reputation here, than most things he could have done, considering his
circumstances with the Emperor. These men we hope to get over su∣pernumerary,
when the rest comes. I never knew what impatience was,
as now to be so long of hearing from your Majesty; especially at a time
when there is all the reason in the world to believe some considerable
action must have been done; and, indeed, in the circumstance your Ma∣jesty's
army was, I think it is a considerable proof of your Majesty's
conduct, that you did not run behind the Shannon, as others advised
you, and as your army had done, had not you been at the head of it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER>At St. Germain, <DATE>25th October.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been several times at this place, in order to lay down ways for
carrying on your Majesty's service; wherein, I hope, now, at last,
something more considerable may be done. For the Queen will give
your Majesty an account of the last discourse she had with this King,
and I shall be sure to press it on with the ministers all I can, so long as
I am here. But I confess an unexpected thing has happened to me, by
a proposal of the Queen's to me, to go to Rome. I defended myself
from it, with that deference I owe to her Majesty; and layed out my
personal defects for that employment. But, withall, laid myself at her
feet, to be disposed of. I likewise would not plead my character already,
for an excuse; but would have had her see it might have been one, if
the necessity was not urgent. She said she would hope, that if the King
<PB N="331" REF="349"/>
here were of the mind, that it were fit I would not refuse the thing.
I am not of a temper ever to refuse any thing, which may be for your
Majesty's service, what hazard or tro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble soever there may be in it.
Of this, I believe, her Majesty will give you an account, and how the
most Christian King was violent for it, as a thing of great importance to
your Majesty and to him both, which I had confirmed to me, by M.
de Seignelay, this day again.</P>
<P>I must, therefore, tell your Majesty, that I go, when they order me
to be gone; and that I expect your Majesty's approbation of my going,
and your commands to me, in the terms here inclosed, or such others,
as your Majesty shall think fit. But it seems to me most proper, to shun
all expences, that I have no character, but that of your Majesty's secre∣tary
of state; and that your Majesty's letters have these expressions in
it. For it will not be fit, that one in my circumstances be made an en∣voy;
and, I am confident, your Majesty would not put it upon me,
and there is not wherewithal to keep out the post of an ambassador:
so secretary is more to be believed, than both the other characters, more
honour and less charge. This, I hope, your Majesty will approve of,
and haste back, two or three several ways, duplicates of what I send
inclosed for your Majesty to sign. The reason that I leave the in∣structions
so general is, that I am confident your Majesty is persuaded,
that I will do all that lies in my power to serve you in every thing,
and that I have the discretion not to do what I ought not, in any of
your Majesty's concerns.</P>
<P>If there be necessity to have letters to any cardinals, such as the car∣dinals
employed in affairs by this Pope, of whom we cannot now think
your Majesty will not take it ill, I sign such letters only of compli∣ment
for you, which I will not do, but only in case of necessity; and
that, I hope, shall not occur.</P>
<P>I am sensible, that I ought not to have gone without your Majesty's
commands, if I had not thought that I could serve you both in this
matter. But, to say the truth, I have been so tossed up and down, I
have no will of my own; and, therefore, whatsoever is best for your
Majesty I do it without hesitation.</P>
<P>I hope to get these duplicates of this dispatch sent next week; and,
therefore, I shall not now enlarge on this matter, of which your Ma∣jesty
<PB N="332" REF="350"/>
will see I had no thought, by my letters to the cardinals d'Esté and
Norfolk. For, though I thought it might be fit, when I was in Ire∣land,
and gave it in a note to your Majesty, yet it was quite out of my
thoughts, having no orders from you; and, besides, now, that, upon
what passed at Fountainbleau, and the conferences I had with the mini∣sters,
the same things being urged by the Queen to the King here, he
begin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to think more of the affairs of England (as possible); and that
probably he will trust your Majesty with his fleet; I might hope to be so
happy as to see your Majesty in England once again: but I submit.</P>
<P>I must tell your Majesty, that there is nothing so wicked, that some
here, and others from England do not vent against me. But, I am afraid,
they will be found as little your Majesty's friends, at the long run, as
these in Scotland were. My happiness is to have your Majesty for my
judge, who, I flatter myself, knows the bottom of my heart; and that
it is as true as ever was in any subject's breast. I am, therefore, hope∣ful
they will have no influence on your Majesty, whose goodness to me,
on so many occasions, is the only comfort of my life; and that I esteem,
above all the share I have of this world. Forgive me saying so much,
tho' it is of one so entirely your Majesty's own, by all the ties which
bind a faithful subject to the best of masters, as well as Kings.</P>
<P>Since writing this, it's thought absolutely fit, that there be another
copy of the letter to the Pope, with credentials in it to me, as embassa∣dor
extraordinary, sent hither to he in the Queen's hands, till she and
the most Christian King find it necessary to make use of them. For it
is most certain I will, at first dash, have all the Spanish and German
faction upon me; and that being the most ceremonious court in the
world, things not yet seen may occur, which may not suffer the delay
of sending to Ireland; and, therefore, it's best to deposit these let∣ters
in the Queen's hands. The form is herewith sent. All of them
have papers sewed on them, to shew what they are for; and they must
all be with flying seals, or not sealed at all; for I can do that when I
get them.</P>
<P>I have sent your Majesty the news from England, at length; an intel∣ligence
which, if rightly made use of here, your affairs had been more
forwardly, both in England and here. But, to say true, its starved, and
like to be broken off. The use which should have been made of it, was
<PB N="333" REF="351"/>
to have turned it into French, and to have sent it to the court of France;
by which they would have seen, by what steps we came to believe that
there is a party in England ready to join, which is still what they have
most doubted of. This I had begun, and likewise a correspondence in
England, by which I had informed them right of the solid things they
were to expect, instead of these airy follies they are undone by, and
learn them to go on better measures; though, indeed, lord Arran and
some pretending to do your Majesty service, have most unjustly injured
me; but, if they serve you, I forgive them; and would go further
than I am going, if that can advance your Majesty's interest a step.
This letter is so impertinently long, that I am ashamed of it, though it
is fit your Majesty know as much as possible of what passes here; and,
indeed, it were to be wished, that there were some of experience and
knowledge of affairs here. For tho' the Queen has as little need of
any to help her, as ever any body, man or woman, had, yet it is an case
for her, sometimes to have people to assist her; and my lord Wald∣grave's
sickness hinders him from thinking of many things too important
to be neglected. Besides, that, for some time, he is to be quite absent.
I confess I never saw any body understand affairs better than the Queen;
and she has really gained so much the esteem of the King here, and his
ministers, that I am truly of the opinion, if it had not been for her,
the wicked reports spread here had made your affairs go entirely wrong
at the court. I dare not enter to speak of the prince, for adding to
this volume; only, I do protest, that he is, without any sort of flattery,
the finest child I ever saw. God Almighty bless your Majesty, the Queen,
and him for your comfort: grant you the possession of your own, and
may you never have a worse servant than, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Melfort was at great pains to obviate all the objections against his
proposals of an invasion of England; as appears from the following
paper, in Nairne's hand, intituled,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“Reasons why his Majesty ought to go with all diligence into England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers. D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 77.</NOTE>
October 20th, 1689.”</HEAD>
<P>“THE kingdom of Ireland, at long run, is not to be kept, against
England and Scotland, without a vast charge.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="352"/>
The kingdom of Ireland is so exhausted, by the many great disorders,
rapines, plunderings, and robberies, that it is not able to furnish any
considerable part of this expence.</P>
<P>The King went to Ireland, only in order to go to England, so soon
as it was in a condition to receive him, with any probability of success.
This probability is, when a considerable party of the nation is ready to
embrace his Majesty's interest, especially the men of quality.</P>
<P>The King, being convinced this is now the case, has all the inclina∣tion
imaginable to proceed on this design.</P>
<P>The question then is, if these be the circumstances of England and
Scotland at this time; which must be tried, by any means shall be
thought fit; which being found true, his Majesty, so generously as∣sisted
hitherto, by the most Christian King, hath no reason to question
his assistance, in this so glorious enterprize, his interest, as well as glory,
being concerned in it.</P>
<P>The kingdom of France is not only surrounded with enemies; which
way soever one looks, they still see a formidable enemy before them;
and, besides, the King is forced to guard a long sea-coast, to preserve his
kingdom from invasion on that side.</P>
<P>All the coast, at the King's first landing, will be immediately out of
danger, and the troops there have leave to be employed elsewhere, to
the great advantage of France; and, as the success is great in Ireland,
the Auxbourg league grows weak: for had the King no other thing to do,
but to assist France, they would soon force their enemies to accept of a
peace of their proposing.</P>
<P>The expences of this, at present, will be money saved next year most
considerable; for what will now be requisite will not preserve Ireland
six months; and this must be done, at long run, ere the King be re∣established.</P>
<P>The men the King sends to his Majesty's assistance, being six thou∣sand,
it will be no difficult matter to make them up to eight thousand,
to give sifteen hundred horse and five hundred dragoons, considering
that, by this, the whole sea-coast is relieved, and sufficiently guarded.</P>
<P>The transportation can be no insuperable difficulty, seeing the most
Christian King hath many more ships of fifty guns and under, than the
<PB N="335" REF="353"/>
English and Dutch. Besides, the Maloines and all these, being ships
proper for winter, will be fitter for this purpose, than bigger ships.</P>
<P>These, or a considerable part of them, must be sent, however, to
transport the succours already condescended to; and the addition will
not be of that importance, as to delay so considerable a design for
France, as well as for the King.</P>
<P>The ports of Ireland for the French are as useful, as those of Eng∣land
can be to the English and Dutch; and their ships, being truly
stronger and better manned, are in a better condition to keep the seas
and for fighting. Besides that, the officers are better, have more ho∣nour,
and fight for a King they justly adore; and that the others
have neither honour, experience, nor care of the usurper, and only fight
for pay.</P>
<P>There are hardly, in summer, many days found, in which fleets can
fight: how much less is such weather to be found in winter?</P>
<P>There are many difficulties in the matter. But it is well known,
the most difficult things to other nations, and impracticable by other
councils, have been contrived and acted with success in France; and, it
is to be hoped, they will find expedients for this matter, which other less
wise or experienced may justly despair of.</P>
<P>By delay, Ireland will be wearied out with a long war; and the do∣mestic
disorders have been so great, that it's to be feared there will
hardly be wherewith to feed the armies next summer.</P>
<P>The King's friends, who have been in an anxious expectation of him
all this summer, will be tired out by imprisonment, sines, processes,
plunderings, and, what is worse, have an ill opinion of the King's con∣duct,
and despair that ever they shall be relieved; and so turn in to where
they may be covered from the violence of that tempest they are threat∣ened
with.</P>
<P>The remainder of the party in Scotland, already almost ruined by
delays, will be quite pulled up by the roots, and the usurpation so settled,
that it will be most difficult to shake it.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange will have an excuse to send all the British forces.
out of England and Scotland, as if to reduce Ireland, and so have an
<PB N="336" REF="354"/>
opportunity to fill that isle with foreigners; which would be more dif∣ficult,
if the forces were at home, and the people put on their guard,
as they may be, by fit instruments, at London; and Scotland is already
upon this foot of demanding the fulfilling of promises, in regard to
their privilege, and yet they have no such ground of complaint as a fo∣reign
army would be.</P>
<P>The King can take the number he designs now from Ireland, without
hazarding that kingdom, all action being there near an end, which
he cannot do, if the summer were come; and, by this means, Ire∣land
will be safer than it is now; the true way to preserve it, being to
attack England. This expedient has been of use before, in as consider∣able
a case.</P>
<P>The advantages the King will have are, that, being on the same
continent with his friends, they will dare to show themselves; and
the indifferent will be obliged to take party, the oppressed will resent
their ill-usage, the old disbanded army have an opportunity to revenge
themselves, the Catholicks have a head to rally to, the church of Eng∣land
the confidence to say they are injured and to demand redress,
the non-conformists, ever trimmers in danger, stand and look on,
and leave the prince and his strangers to act for themselves; resent∣ments
of wrongs, hopes of advantage, pardon, preferment, or safety,
each argument will have its party, and the giddy humour of that nation,
never content, will make them as apt to huzanna, as they were before
to persecute; and, in general, it is a strong argument to be in peace,
on the legal foot; a thing not to be hoped for under the usurper. The
prince of Wales is no more disputed. God be blessed, he thrives. This
was looked on as impossible, and was the strongest argument to join
with that prince, whom, they thought, would, sooner or later, be their
master, and use them as they should now do him. The bribes he pro∣mised
are not paid; or, if they be, they who have them would be con∣tent
to save them. All these things make for the King's going, as
soon as it is possible for him.</P>
<P>At his landing, the best port in England will be in his hands; which,
being secured, affords a secure retreat to any ships of the most Christian
King, who shall have any need thereof, especially in case of any engage∣ment
on the coast of England. Going, at this season, secures any post
<PB N="337" REF="355"/>
the King shall take, if he resolves not to advance, through any disap∣pointment
he may meet with; the season making the action difficult, in
that country where the King must land, except the numbers be unequal,
as it is supposed the King's will be much superior to what the prince of
Orange can bring; who has not now above ten thousand foot in all the
south of England, and very few horse or dragoons.</P>

<HEAD>Lord Melfort to King James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 75.</NOTE> October, 1689.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A copy in Nairne's hand.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The misrepresentations of D' Avaux.—The character of the duchess of Tyrcon∣nel.—Bishop
Malony, and the Irish faction.—They will endeavour to
carry every thing in parliament.—He advises James not to call one.—
Divisions in Scotland and England.—A correspondence to be settled with
the malecontents.—Melsort is to set out on his embassy.</HEAD>
<P>THE last later I had the honour of writing to your Majesty was so
long, that it has not lest much for me to say; and this carries the
duplicate of that whole dispatch; and, therefore, I must not weary your
Majesty with too long a letter now.</P>
<P>The wicked informations which have been sent hither, are of worse
consequence, and more uneasy to remove, than I thought them to be;
because there comes daily fresh supplies to support the old; and so in∣dustrious
they are here, they need but a hint to serve for a foundation.
They build upon it abundantly.</P>
<P>M D'Avaux is not idle of his side. The last post was full of his in∣vectives.
(But I must first caution your Majesty, that it must be for
your own use, left I hurt my informers; for they saw the letter itself).
In the first place, he says, that all things now go well, since I was sent
away: that all the Irishmen have another heart, since they saw my lord
Tyrconnel with them; and that it is evidently seen the prejudice I did
to your Majesty's affairs. This he has reason to write here. But how
does this agree with the great desire he shewed to have me stay?</P>
<P>In the next place, he says, that now your Majesty is beginning to take
up the protestants of Dublin; and that, once before, there were a good
many in prison; but that I let them out without order; and that for
<PB N="338" REF="356"/>
many I gave passes, at Cork and Kinsale, to men who now are with Schom∣berg,
and that after my coming away from Dublin. These things are
such follies as all wise men laugh at, and his best friends here say, that he
pushes the matter too far to be believed: for he has shewn malice, and
so deserves no credit; and, as for what relates to me, I laugh at him,
and would say no more; but to you there are some things else to be
said. Mr. de Lauzun is to go over, and I am afraid that he and the
ambassador will not agree long together. This will draw in my lady,
and consequently my lord Tyrconnel, and there will be a war in your
own court, which I sled hither to shun: for that end, that there may be
no dissention, it were sit D' Avaux were recalled; which advice (as many
others I have given) is downright against my own interest; for it would
be no small justification to me here, if he should agree as ill with Mr.
de Lauzun; and, besides, it's better for me now, that I shall not be
here, that he were at a distance likewise. But that does not bias me.
He ought to be recalled, for the quiet of your affairs. He could not
agree with one submitted to him: how will he with one who will not
yield an ace, nor let him meddle with French troops pay or preferment?
this I see is the other's temper, and I dread the consequences. There is
one other thing, if it could be effectuate, were of infinite use; which is
the getting the duchess of Tyrconnel, for her health, to come into France.
I did not know she had been so well known here as she is; but the terms
they give her, and which, for your service, I may repeat unto you, is,
that she has <HI>(I' ame la plus noire qui se puisse concevoir.)</HI> I think it would
help to keep that peace, so necessary for you, and prevent that caballing
humour, which has very ill effects.</P>
<P>These things I write, not for the outward appearance, but because
there is a secret spring at bottom I confess I like not; and that on two
accounts. First, it is said, Churchill has more influence in that matter,
and this I believe not, except she have sent her money into England.
But the second is another thing, the keeping up a correspondence here,
the bottom whereof I will not understand; first, by herself with Mr.
Courtin and by him; and secondly, by the nephew with the Irish here,
who begin to have discourses of the freedom of their nation. I must not
repeat, but your Majesty must prevent, lest it come too late, by putting
it out of the power of any one family to make Ireland change a master.
<PB N="339" REF="357"/>
This is that what prudence demands without suspecting any, and I must
humbly lay it before your Majesty the true way to do this. As I have
often said, get men of your own independent men, on whom build a
government as united in your Majesty's interest as possible, but as inde∣pendent
of one another. I wish I had the honour to be half an hour
with you for the reasons of this advice, which I dare not write left this
fall in hands there. The person who carries on the design here is bishop
Malony, and it is plainly a faction of almost all the Irish to lay all
blame at your door and to applaud Tyrconnel; not that they care for him,
otherwise than that he is Irish. They say openly, that no man is to be
trusted, but the Irish; and that now is the time to play their game or
never. They curse the last parliament, as a company of easy men, for
not sticking to their demands; and that, in the next, they will have
other things done, especially the overturning Poynings laws, &amp;c. Lord
Clare has written to bishop Malony, telling him, that they will trust
none but their own countrymen; and, therefore, shortly there will be an
envoy there, for their affairs; but he will employ his interest, that Ma∣lony
shall be the man. From this, your Majesty will find the necessity
of having no parliament; and, on my conscience, I think it so much for
your service, that I am confident you will not suffer any to meet. You
want not excuses too good; but it will be attempted most certainly.
But I hope, in God, no persuasion will make you yield to it. In the
next place, there is an absolute necessity to call over to Ireland this bishop
Malony; for he is not what he ought to be. His correspondent, for that
letter, is Sir Neal O'Neal, nephew of my lord Tyrconnel; and, if your
Majesty make not an example of him, all will pass for true he has sent;
and one such action, judged by the council or judges, would put a stop
to these stories here, if rightly used. And, for another means, I must
beg of you to examine the French ambassador, as not knowing a thing
written by him; but as a report here, if any such things has been said
to him; and, if he denies it, to write it to me. If he says, there has,
cause examine it fully, and send the issue; but let it be examined when
your Majesty is present. I know the rest are not to be trusted. This,
if it were only for my vindication, I should not have the confidence to
ask, though I flatter myself with the hopes, your goodness to me would
not refuse to clear a faithful servant, that does almost nothing, besides
<PB N="340" REF="358"/>
your service; and whose zeal, for your interest, I hope, your Majesty is
persuaded of. But, indeed, it is your own interest I pursue in this, that
his black calumnies against your Majesty's proceedings may not be
trusted hereafter. For just now he complains of the rashness of your
conduct, in going on to Allerston-bridge, so near the enemy, and that
against his advice, and that of all the general officers of his nation. I
do not find, that has taken here: for your Majesty is much commended
for it: only all are of opinion, that, if you are forced to retire, you
should chicane, and still ruin all behind you. This Mr. de Belfond
came with a card yesterday to shew me. I most humbly beg leave now
to go to the other side of the water.</P>
<P>By the advices from England, your Majesty will see the disposition
of affairs, and the necessity of following these affairs more closely. In∣deed
there are many things to do, which require the utmost skill and
application; and am sorry, that I must leave them; but I will tell your
Majesty the heads of what is to be done. Scotland is dissatisfied; would
offer fair. I have given the heads. These assurances I know your
Majesty will approve of; that is, they offer to yield, without capitulat∣ing
for religion, they having the pardon for what is past. I have writ∣ten,
that they doing the best to bring your Majesty back by these ways
they have in their hands, they shall not only have pardon for lives and
fortunes, but they shall have rewards suitable to the actual services
they shall hereafter perform. Now going away, without their answer, I
leave that to the Queen, and am confident your Majesty will forgive
for hazarding such things, when a day is of importance, as it is in this
case, by reason they are at London, and actually now treating with
Orange.</P>
<P>As for the English, they are divided in factions. One knows not of
another; yet I would have found a way to have let most of them know
your Majesty's mind; but that I must leave too; only I must say, this
correspondence must be continued, and the money necessary for that left
here in the Queen's hands, and I shall leave a memorial with her of the
way it is to be done. Now that I am sent to Rome, I hope I shall serve
your Majesty usefully there; though, I must confess, I saw more to be
done here, that others understand not, than I do there, where I am but
as others, without experience, their language, or acquaintance. But I am
<PB N="341" REF="359"/>
glad to go, where God ordains, and your Majesty's service calls me.
The M. C. King has given to me of allowance, as to his ambassadors
extraordinary, and has given me a memorial, a copy whereof I send
inclosed. I can only say to your Majesty, that there shall be no want of
me, except of natural understanding; for what I have shall be employed
to the utmost. I have been happy in Mr. Tallon, who has got me ac∣quainted
with some men of admirable knowledge in the matters of that
court, and I hope all shall do well. I shall be ordered in every thing
by cardinal D'Esté, and he shall be the witness of all my actions. I
hope your Majesty will be pleased to have all that you think fit con∣stantly
transmitted to me, and defend me from all my enemies behind
me: for I am determined never to look back, when your service lies be∣fore
me. I have reasons of great weight to send over father Maxwell
to wait on your Majesty, for a correspondence I must not have known to
any but your Majesty; and I humbly beg it of your Majesty to
take him, as one of your chaplains, the time he stays; himself deserves
it on many accounts, and your Majesty has none of his nation. But
these are not now the only reasons. I beg it for your own service, and
what I shall answer your Majesty shall have no cause to repent of. I
have told him many things, as under confession, with power only to re∣veal
them to yourself; and he, knowing the jealousy, will be better able
to watch the designs of these caballers, and to let you know their pro∣gress;
for I have given him his measures here, and I am sure he will
obey them exactly.</P>
<P>These letters, when compared with the accounts printed of the in∣trigues
of the year 1689, authenticate the history of that period—The
private instructions which Melfort gave to father Maxwell, his confessor,
are in his lordship's hand-writing, among Nairne's papers.—The reasons
for sending him to Ireland are mentioned in the preceding letter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Instructions for Mr. Maxwell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Pa∣pers, D N 1. fol. No. 76.</NOTE> going into Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>TO give the King his letters, and to inform him, that, under the seal
of confession to all, besides the King himself, I had told him of
what was said to be a-doing amongst the Irish in Paris and elsewhere,
<PB N="342" REF="360"/>
that the King might have his eyes open to prevent their folly, if it were
really true. First, That it has been debated amongst them, whether it
be not their interest to join themselves to some catholic crown able to
protect them, rather than be subject to the revolutions of the protestant
kingdoms of Great Britain; and that most of them at Paris have been
of this mind.</P>
<P>That upon this design it was, that they were so <HI>opiniatre</HI> in some
points in the parliament; and that, after it, they decried the King's
proceedings, to make it the easier to go off from him, if they found any
to accept of them.</P>
<P>That it was for this, they would have all Irish secretaries and other
officers Irish, that they might have it, one time, in their power to ma∣nage
this matter the more closely.</P>
<P>To furnish these at Paris with arguments of the necessity of these
things, some in Ireland were employed to write letters to defame the
King and his government, and to cry up that of the natives.</P>
<P>These letters were all translated into French, and by bishop Malony,
taking on him as empowered for Ireland, communicated to the court of
France.</P>
<P>That it was, for this reason, they could not suffer the earl of Melfort,
suspecting that he would soon see this matter, of which the King knows
his suspicions founded on appearances.</P>
<P>That the duchess of Tyrconnel is a main instrument, in carrying on
this design, and keeps a constant correspondence with M. Courtin, and,
by him, with M. Louvois. That, for this reason, bishop Malony stays
here, and had the impudence to give one of these lybels to the Queen,
and to propose to her the having an Irish envoy at the court of France;
he himself having the promise of lord Clare and others for their endea∣vours,
that he shall be the man.</P>
<P>For this reason, it's said to be, that M. D'Avaux had made a fac∣tion
amongst the Irish; but that the design was rejected with scorn here.
For that reason, that advice was given to abandon the kingdom to
Schomberg, thinking the King would lose the hearts of the people, by
deserting them; and others gain it, by recovering it again, when the
<PB N="343" REF="361"/>
succours came over. This design not relished here, they use only to per∣suade
the usefulness of it.</P>
<P>Many more things are said, and original informations to be shewn the
Queen of all the matter, principally in relation to a session of parlia∣ment,
in which great things are proposed to the nation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To prevent the mischief of this, it will be necessary, in the first place,
that in all places hereafter to be filled, the King choose men having no
dependant, but on himself alone; and that, so long as he is there in
person, he discourages all dependance an any other to eclipse him; but
in such a manner, as none can take exception justly at.</P>
<P>The next thing is, by no means to have a session of parliament there,
having excuses none can take exceptions at.</P>
<P>Pope Innocent the XI. died on the 12th of August, 1689. James
received the news of his death, in a letter from the cardinals, while he
was at Dundalk, offering battle to Schomberg.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers. D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 71.</NOTE> His answer to them,
then assembled in the conclave, is in the style of a true son of the
church, and dated from Dundalk, the 30th of September.</P>
<P>On the 6th of October, Alexander the VIII. was placed in the papal
chair. Lewis the XIV. who had renewed the war with the Emperor,
was desirous of securing the favour of the new pontiff, and a temporary
accommodation was made up between the courts of Rome and Versailles,
by a tacit concession of some of the pretensions on both sides. Lewis
likewise advised the Queen to send Melfort to Rome, in quality of am∣bassador
from James, as mentioned by Melfort himself in the preceding
letters, and he furnished him with instructions, that he might not be
obliged to wait, until he received them from his master. These instruc∣tions
are among Mr. Nairne's papers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 68.</NOTE> and entitled, “Memorial for the
earl of Melfort, going to Rome on the part of the King of Great Bri∣tain.”
Lewis believed it was necessary, that James should have a mi∣nister
at Rome, in order to cultivate a good understanding with the
Pope, and to procure his holiness's assistance in re-establishing him,
and in preventing the entire abolition of the Romish faith in the
British empire. He thought Melfort well qualified to execute such
a commission, and furnished him with ample directions before he set
<PB N="344" REF="362"/>
out on his embassy. He directed him to cultivate a good understand∣ing
with the cardinals and ministers of France, who would have in∣structions
to second him in his negociations; and particularly with cardi∣nal
D'Este, who might be of infinite service, and had already given
sufficient proofs of his attachment to the interests of his Britannic Majesty,
which cardinal Norfolk, though his subject, had always neglected. He
desired him to represent the low state of his master's affairs, and to
shew the pope, that providence seemed to have reserved, for the ho∣nour
of his pontificate, the most glorious enterprize that could be un∣dertaken
for the advantage of religion and the good of the church.</P>
<P>These circumstances, Lewis continued, were favourable. The prince
of Orange's tyranny had become insupportable, even to those who had
called him over. There was a strong party for James in Scotland, in
England, and in Ireland; but it was necessary to support them. The
protestant princes were in a league to abolish the Roman Catholic reli∣gion
(of which Lewis attempts to give proofs in Britain, Holland, Den∣mark,
Sweden, and Germany). It was incumbent on the see of Rome
to employ all its authority, and even the treasures of the church, against
them. The prince of Orange, if he was once master of the British em∣pire,
and the States General in conjunction, would endeavour to re∣establish
Calvinism in France, and even to introduce it into Italy. The
protestant princes and states had deluded the Roman Catholic princes,
and met with no opposition but from France. France was able to
defend itself, but the union of the house of Austria with protestant princes
could not fail to be prejudicial to the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>Melfort should endeavour to persuade the Pope, to bring the Empe∣ror
and the King of Spain to the sentiments with which the danger that
threatened their religion should inspire them; to unite the Roman Ca∣tholic
princes in a league to restore a King, who suffered merely for his
attachment to the religion of the holy see; to discontinue the subsidy
which his predecessor gave to the emperor, and to employ it in assisting
the loyal subjects of the King of England, to drive away the usurper of
his throne.</P>

<P>SO soon as you shall have received these our instructions and our let∣ter
to the Pope, you shall demand an audience of his holiness, wherein
you shall congratulate his exaltation to the holy chair, in our name; as∣suring
him of our filial obedience, and that the reason of your not using
the character of our ambassador extraordinary to perform these things,
in the due manner, proceeds from the present ill condition of our affairs.</P>
<P>You shall hold forth to him the present state of our affairs, the injus∣tice
we suffer, upon the account of our religion, and the fears the pro∣testants
had of its apparent progress, in our dominions; the violence of
the persecution against the Catholics, and the horridness of the usurpa∣tion
of the prince of Orange. That this affair is not only of import∣ance
to us, but to the whole Catholic world. You are, therefore, to
demand his holiness's assistance, by endeavouring a peace among Catho∣lic
princes; if not general, yet to disunite as many as is possible from the
protestant alliance, that so our dearest brother, the most Christian King,
may be the better enabled to give us those generous assistances, our ne∣cessities
call for from him towards our re-establishment.</P>
<P>And, whilst this is doing, you are to press, that his holiness may give
us such present supplies, as may enable us to wait for the other, and to
maintain these dominions we are in possesion of.</P>
<P>Such letters to cardinals or others as may be necessary, and we cannot
here think of now, cause prepare there, and sign for us, so as they may
be thought from us.</P>
<P>You shall make our compliments to such cardinals as you shall find
to stand well-affected to us, especially to the cardinal of Norfolk.</P>
<P>You are to communicate, in all things, with the cardinal D'Estè, our
cousin, whose directions you are to follow, in what relates to our service.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="364"/>
You are to correspond with the ministers employed there by our dearest
brother, the most Christian King, and go alongst with them in all things;
our interest and that of our dearest brother being all the same.</P>
<P>You shall do all things which you judge can best conduce to the weal
of our service, and obey what orders you shall receive from our dearest
consort the Queen, as if they were immediately given by us.</P>
<P>You shall remain at Rome, or where his Holiness shall be, till re∣called
by us or our dearest consort the Queen.</P>
<P>You shall diligently observe what you may think worth informing us
or our dearest consort the Queen of; and inform us punctually thereof,
from time to time, by letters directed to ourselves; and we shall, from
time to time, send you such other instructions as may be for our service.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Lord Melfort to the Queen. Toulon, November 22d, 1689.</HEAD>
<P>THE intelligences which come from England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 78. November.</NOTE> containing many things
of great importance, it is fit that extracts of them be punctually
translated into French, and given to the French ministers, that they,
knowing the true progress of the King's affairs in England, may the more
readily join in the measures which may be most useful for the King; and
that the most Christian King himself may the better judge of what is pro∣posed
to him by your Majesty.</P>
<P>There seems to be some jarrings betwixt the prince of Orange and the
rebellious Scots, which it will be fit to foment; and, for that end, all
encouragement must be given to such as will stand up against him, they
promising to adhere to the King's interest; and this being begun already,
must be carefully continued, and the King's authority interposed (if re∣quired
by these Scots) or the Queen, till that can be had.</P>
<P>This beginning in Scotland will, no doubt, have great consequences,
if the King's friends in England take the example, in that parliament,
<PB N="347" REF="365"/>
which is now assembled at Westminster;<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> where a few resolute members
might put a great stop to the P. of O. his proceedings, if not quite
defeat his designs, money being his great business. Many reasons can
be alledged to hinder it, and whatever is done on that head, is grateful
to the people, who love not to pay their money, now especially, that
trade is low. Care, therefore, must be taken to insinuate this to all
the parties the King has in England; and money, &amp;c. must be offered
to such as will appear in that affair.</P>
<P>The persons who can best manage this matter, are these from whom
the several intelligences come; seeing that the parties know not of one
another, and that it is of importance to keep all their councils; and,
for this reason, some money must be lodged in careful hands, for the
carrying on this work, besides what must be employed in relieving starv∣ing
prisoners; which is a justice and charity not to be forgotten, as far
as is possible, considering the circumstances.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Clerk is not to be forgot, and those of his gang; for,
though I have not his acquaintance, yet I must say, that, as to his in∣telligence,
he has done more than all the rest together; and, therefore,
4 or 500 <HI>l.</HI> to be put in his hands, to be disposed of for the King's ser∣vice,
is absolutely necessary for carrying on that intelligence, and it
must not be lost on any terms. Mr. Belsons is likewise of great use, and
he must have some assistance, just that he may live.</P>
<P>It is of importance, that what your Majesty does in these things be
only known to yourself, and to such as Sir Robert Clerk and Mr. Belsons
trust: for there are some, whom your Majesty trusts, that these would
not; and they bearing the hazard, it is just to humour them in this
manner. Of this, Mr. Innes can inform more particularly; and, see∣ing
it is he who has been at the expences on this side, it will be sit that he
have just as much as to reimburse him; and more he will not, at this
time, expect from your Majesty.</P>
<P>All imaginable instances must be made, with the most Christian King,
to get some way to transport the King into England; and, as argu∣ments
arise, from the several intelligences from England, Scotland, or
Ireland, this must still be made use of to facilitate the matter, at least,
against the spring.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="366"/>
It will be most necessary to see, if some of the Irish or French mer∣chants
will carry arms into Ireland to sell, for which they will get great
prices in the native commodity of that kingdom, to wit, wool, butter,
beef, &amp;c. by which an useful trade will be carried on to both nations
and much for the King's interest. The best way will be, for your Ma∣jesty
to cause some of the most substantial merchants be spoken with,
and pressed to, as good service for their own nation.</P>
<P>It will be most fit to endeavour some separate relief for Scotland, besides
what goes into Ireland, as well to shew these brave men, who stand out for
the King, in despite of all discouragement, that they are not forgot, as re∣ally
to enable them to make a more powerful diversion against the spring;
which, if it can be effectuate, will be of a vast importance. If it cannot
be obtained from the most Christian King, it is of such importance, that it
will be fit for your Majesty yourself to do something in it, even out of such
money as the King is to get from France. Great care is to be taken to
suppress, as much as may be, the clamours, and indeed follies, of some
Irish at Paris, by letting them know the undutifulness of their proceed∣ings,
and sending some of the most busy into Ireland. It will be abso∣lutely
necessary to have some amongst them to inform of what passes;
for this employment Mr. Sheridan is the most proper man; and from
him may be got the most secret of their intrigues and correspondences;
though, at the same time, great care is to be had not to believe what he
brings not good proofs for, especially as to the foolish design he men∣tioned
to me of delivering up the kingdom; a thing would never be
accepted; and, besides, so foolish and villainous in them, that I can∣not
think it ever entered into their heads. If it has, they are only
some mad-men, and has foolishly been talking at random, and not any
men of sense or consideration. To find out this, Sheridan is to shew
his proofs, but only to your Majesty: for the thing is so foolish, and so
undutiful, that it's of importance it go no farther.</P>
<P>I need not put your Majesty in mind how necessary it is to free your
own family of any who may be spies upon your actions. It is a most
intolerable thing for us, who are private people, to be constrained in
our families; and must be much more troublesome to your Majesty,
who ought much less to be subjected to such hardships.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="367"/>
It is, in my opinion, most necessary that Mr. de Lauzun be made as
easy as is possible to make him: for, if once there begin any jarrings,
they will have worse consequences than any thing has yet happened;
and care must be had of any pretensions he may have, that the King
be informed of them; and that, from time to time, he gratify him in
such things as he may justly pretend to; and, on the other side, the D. of
Tyrconnel would be precautioned not to suffer himself to be led into
such little cabals as may disorder the King's affairs, and never end in any
other confusion.</P>
<P>The pretensions of the French, as to their ranks, must be sent over
distinctly to the King, that he may prepare all who are concerned to
submit to what he shall determine. This Mr. de Lauzun can inform of,
and it's best doing it now, before the troops part from Brest.</P>
<P>This being all that occurs at this time, if there be any thing more, it
shall be sent as soon as possible; and, if any thing occur to your Ma∣jesty,
you have but to let me receive your commands, and they shall be
most punctually obeyed.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MELFORT.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>Melfort arrived at Rome before he received King James's instructions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE>
For the first memorial which he presented to the Pope was in the name
of the Queen. It is in Mr. Nairne's hand, and dated December 19th,
1689.</P>
<P>AFTER a complimentary preamble to his Holiness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 79.</NOTE> Melfort begins with
assuring him, “That there never was a King of England so beloved
and so obeyed by his people, as his Majesty, until it appeared by his
actions, that he was more zealous to gain a heavenly crown for his sub∣jects,
than careful to preserve an earthly one for himself. This and the
extirpation of heresy in France, gave such an alarm to the protestants
throughout all Europe, and even hell itself, that they put in practice
every means, however detestable, to ruin the King, and with him all
those who had the same sentiments of piety and religion.”</P>
<P>This mystery of iniquity, as Melfort calls it, must, according to him,
without a speedy remedy, be of the most fatal consequences to the Ca∣tholic
<PB N="350" REF="368"/>
religion: but he saves the pope the pain of hearing, and to him∣self
the pain of repeating them, as it is sufficient, that his Holiness
knows that the King has been chased from his kingdoms merely on ac∣count
of his religion, and obliged to throw himself into the arms of the
only sovereign among his allies, who was not an accomplice in the prince
of Orange's designs. His most Christian Majesty has so generously as∣sisted
him, that he has been able to quell almost entirely the rebellion
in Ireland, by defeating Schomberg's army, and reducing it to its present
distress.</P>
<P>From the state which Melfort gives of his master's affairs, he endea∣vours
to shew that his Holiness can re-establish him, if he will give an
immediate supply of money, and bring about a peace among the Catholic
princes, who might then be persuaded to assist in restoring his Britannick
Majesty.</P>
<P>“The affairs of the King my master have nothing in common with
those of the other catholic princes. He hath given no occasion to the
present war. It was merely his religion which alarmed the protestant
princes, and drew upon him his misfortunes. If he had been partial,
or formed alliances, as has been falsely supposed, his Majesty would
not be in the circumstances in which he now finds himself; and if he
had not refused the assistance which his most Christian Majesty offered to
him, he would have had no difficulty in repelling the violences of the
prince of Orange, and in curbing the insolence of his subjects: but he
generously refused them, to avoid the partiality of which he hath been
since accused, as guarantee of the peace of Nimeguen: and it is very
certain, that if the King my master had been in concert with his most
Christian Majesty, the first hostilities would not have commenced to∣wards
Philipsburgh.”</P>
<P>For these and other reasons, Melfort thinks the catholic princes will
be disposed to assist his master. He adds a great many arguments in the
same strain, and concludes his long memorial with these words:</P>
<P>“As for myself, I reckon it a happiness to be at the feet of your
Holiness; having nothing to solicit, but the concerns of the King my
master, which are, at present, those of your Holiness; and, after hav∣ing
endeavoured to discharge my duty towards God and my King, al∣though
<PB N="351" REF="369"/>
in a more weak and defective manner than another would have
done, that I have an opportunity of soliciting for myself your Holiness's
apostolical benediction.”</P>
<P>It was probably at this time that Melfort, according to his instructions,
gave a memorial to the cardinal D'Esté. It is marked at the top in his
hand-writing.</P>
<Q>A paper given to his serene highness the cardinal D'Esté.</Q>
<P>He begins with repeating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 82.</NOTE> as in the preceding memorial, that his
master suffered for his attachment to the catholic religion; and that be∣ing
the cause of the holy See, and of the Pope, his Holiness could not
avoid to assist him; which could only be done in two ways, by bringing
about a peace between the Roman Catholic princes, and by furnishing
his Majesty with money. To open a congress for such a peace, his Holi∣ness
should dispatch legates, who were well disposed to the cause, to dif∣ferent
courts. A supply of money was absolutely necessary that very
season, to secure the safety of Ireland, and accomplish the reduction of
Scotland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AFFAIRS of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES the Seventh, upon his accession, was addressed by the Scotish
parliament, with expressions of the most servile adulation, and with
promises of perpetual attachment to his person, and absolute submission
to his will. They acknowledged, in an act, “That the blessings the
nation then enjoyed were owing to the solid and absolute authority with
which their Kings were invested.” They expressed their abhorrence of all
principles which are contrary or derogatory to the “King's sacred, su∣preme,
absolute power and authority;” and they promised to give entire
obedience to the King, “without reserve.” They gave him convincing
proofs of the sincerity of these professions, by extending the laws of
treason, and obliging all the men in the nation, above sixteen years of
age, to be in “readiness to attend the King, in arms, where and as oft
as he should require.”</P>
<P>But the measures of the new reign were not calculated to continue the
popularity with which it began. James composed a new ministry, con∣sisting
<PB N="352" REF="370"/>
almost entirely of Papists and non-conformists. He gave new
commissions to all those who were in public stations, without requiring
their compliance with the tests. He dispensed with the execution of the
penal laws; and advanced Roman Catholics to many places of honour
and emolument in the kingdom.</P>
<P>These measures, and the unpopular character of secretary Melfort and
others, lessened greatly the affection of the people for James and his
government. Yet he had still many friends among the Scots. When
the prince of Orange landed in England, he was invited by them, after
he retired to France, to return and join them. James, however, thought
it more for his interest to go to Ireland; and he contented himself with
writing a letter to the convention, which the prince of Orange had sum∣moned
to assemble, at Edinburgh, in the month of March. His letter
was dated, after he had embarked, on board the St. Michael, the 1st of
March, 1689. From Ireland, he sent them the proclamation referred
to, in the journal he sent to France by lord Dover. In the mean time,
his friends in Scotland, particularly the viscount Dundee, were diligent
in increasing the number of his adherents.</P>
<P>Dundee, who had refused to enter into the service of King William,
came to the convention of estates, which had assembled, at Edinburgh,
on the fourteenth of March; but, finding he was deserted by some who
pretended, at first, to adhere to the cause of his master, and apprehending
there was a design to assassinate him, he retired, at the head of a troop
of fifty horsemen, who had deserted to him from his own regiment,
then in England; and, having reconciled some of the Highland clans,
who had been quarrelling among themselves, he began hostilities, with∣out
waiting either for a commission or the succours which James had
promised to send him from Ireland.</P>
<P>Among Mr. Nairne's papers, there is a copy of an account of his
military operations, which was sent to Ireland. It is called on the
back:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“News from Scotland with Mr. Hay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 49.</NOTE> Received July 7th, 1689.”</HEAD>
<P>“BY the last information, sent by Mr. M'Swine, account was given how
the viscount of Dundee parted from Edinburgh; how he stayed at
his own house for above a fortnight after, guarded by a party of 50 horse;
<PB N="353" REF="371"/>
and how,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> after a party of the Scotch dragoons came over to Dundee,
with a party of Mackay's foot, he marched towards Inverness, encou∣raging
all persons to stand out, letting them see, by his example, there
was no danger in it. The account was also given, how he went through
Murray, and was come back to Castle-Gordon, when M'Swine was dis∣patched.
After which, he marched to the Cairn of Mounth, designing
to go near Dundee, encouraged by the promises the Scotch dragoons
had sent him, that they would declare for the King; but, by the way,
having intercepted a messenger of the master of Forbes, returning from
Edinburgh, found, by Mackay's letters, that he was to be at Dundee
that night, with 200 foot and a regiment of English horse; and they,
with the dragoons and the foot that came there before, were to pursue
him wherever he went. The lord viscount waited at the Cairn of Mounth,
till M'Kay was within eight miles, and then marched back towards Castle∣Gordon,
(where the earl of Dunfermling, with 40 or 50 gentlemen, joined
him) and from thence through Murray to Inverness, where he found the
laird of Keppoch at the head of 700 men; the most part volunteers.
They plundered M'Intosh's lands and the neighbourhood; which M'In∣tosh,
in a manner, deserved, because the viscount had written twice to
him, to declare for the King, and had got no return. The laird of Kil∣ravock,
with 300 men, was on one side of Keppoch, and the town of
Inverness in arms on the other. The viscount sent to Kilravock to know
his design. He professed loyalty, and so was allowed to guard his coun∣try.
The magistrates of Inverness came and informed him, that Kep∣poch
had forced them to promise him 4000 marks. My lord Dundee
told them, that Keppoch had no warrant from him to be in arms, much
less to plunder; but that necessity had forced him out, and told he would
give his bond that, at the King's return, (since they had not yet declared
the prince of Orange King) they should have their money repaid them.
After which, he desired Keppoch to march his men with him, and he
would go and engage M'Kay. But the men, partly the Camerons, said
they could not, without consent of their master; but the truth was, they
were loaded with spoil, and neither they nor their leader had any thing
else in head; so they went home plundering on the way.</P>
<P>The viscount marched to Glengairi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so into Badenoch, where,
considering the season was advanced towards the 8th of May, and the
<PB N="354" REF="372"/>
grass begun to appear, and having found the disposition of the low
countries for the King, and received letters from most of the chiefs of
clans of their readiness, and being informed of the substance of bre∣vettes,
letters, and commissions, and finding that M'Kay was endeavour∣ing
to raise Highlanders and others for to ruin and suppress the King's
faithful subjects, before the estate of his affairs in Ireland would allow
him to come to their relief, the said viscount resolved to appoint a ge∣neral
rendezvous, which accordingly he did, to be, the 18th of May, in
Lochaber, and acquainted all chiefs of clans; and, in the mean time,
M'Kay being at Inverness, he took occasion to slip down through Athol,
to St. Johnston, where he surprised the laird of Blair, seized him, his
lieutenant Pogue of that ilk, trumpet, standard, and all the troopers
that were in the town, with two lieutenants of M'Kay's, and two or three
officers of the new levies; most of which are sent to an island of the
M'Lean's, which is said to be like the Bass. After which, he went to
Dundee, thinking to gain the two troops of Scotch dragoons: but
could not prevail, because of captain Balfour, who commanded them;
yet he forced them to leave Dundee, but could do no more, because the
town was in rebellion, and the streets barricadoed. He caused seize the
drums and baggage of the laird of Drum, and others of the earl of Mar's
officers, and chased the lieutenant colonel, and might have seised whole
companies, but was not at the pains; yet frightened and scattered them
so, that they have not been heard of since. After which, having seised
300<HI>l.</HI> of cess and excise, the lord viscount took his march through
Athol and Rannoch, up to Lochaber, to keep the dyet of the rendez∣vous.
Glengairie kept the clay punctually, with betwixt 2 and 300
men (who, on all occasions, shews himself a man of honour, sense, and
integrity.) Next came a very honest gentleman, the laird of Morer,
commanding all the captain of Clan Rannald's men, on the main land
near 200. Next came Appin and Glenco, towards 200. Sir Donald
M'Donald was expected, but was not ready. M'Lean gave account,
that he was just coming; and, after having made the viscount stay six
days, Sir Alexander M'Lean, hearing his friends were in difficulties,
sailed away to Kintyr, with his men and an hundred of M'Lean's: at the
same time M'Lean fell sick. Lochiel came, with 600 men; Keppoch,
with 200; with which the viscount marched into Badenoch, in haste, hear∣ing
<PB N="355" REF="373"/>
that colonel Ramsay was coming that way, with 700 foot, to join
M'Kay at Inverness; and, accordingly, Ramsay having marched from
Edinburgh to St. Johnston, and near 40 miles up towards Ruthven in
Badenoch; but upon different news of my lord Dundee's coming, went
back and fore in the hill a whole night. In the end, he went back in
great confusion to St. Johnston. Several of his men deserted. The
Athol men got together; and, by the prudence of the gentry, with great
difficulty, were hindered from falling on them. Ramsay posted to Edin∣burgh,
and got commission of fire and sword against Athol. About this
time, account was brought to Dundee, that M'Kay was within four
miles of him, with great numbers of Highlanders, Grant's men, M'In∣tosh's,
Balnagown's, Rae's, Strathnaver's, and Monroe's, beside the
standing troops. On which, he caused draw out all the men, and bid
them be gaining towards a very strong ground, and sent out a party im∣mediately
to view the enemy, following it himself; having left orders
with Lochiel, that the body should not go above half a mile back.
However, when he returned, he understood that M'Kay had almost no
Highlanders, and was not there to fight, but to meet Ramsay. He
found that all the troops had marched four miles back. However, he
made all haste to march to engage M'Kay: but, before he could come
to the place, M'Kay was so far gone, that he could not be overtaken;
and being informed there, that Sir Donald and M'Lean were yet to join,
thought fit to wait; and, in the mean time, blockt up the castle of
Ruthven, where M'Kay had put 50 of Grant's men in garrison. After
some days, the castle, wanting provisions, surrendered; which being
burnt, and lost hopes of M'Lean, and fear of Ramsay, my lord re∣solved
to engage M'Kay. But, so soon as he heard of the march to∣wards
him, he dislodged in the night. The viscount pursued him four
days; and, by an unexpected way, came in sight of him, an hour be∣fore
the sun set, and pursued them so close, that parties of the Highlanders
were within shot of the rear-guard, close to the main body, and dark
night came on; save which, nothing could have saved them, in all hu∣man
probability. The ground was dangerous, and the march had been
long; so that the viscount thought not fit to follow further, being within
three miles of Strathbogy, a plain country, where the horse and dra∣goons
had too much advantage of the Highlanders. The next morn∣ing,
<PB N="356" REF="374"/>
hearing M'Kay had marched 10 miles before he halted, the viscount
lay still all that day; but, being after informed, that Sir James Lesly,
with his regiment of foot and another regiment of dragoons, had joined
M'Kay, and the officers of the Scotch dragoons having sent to acquaint
the viscount, that there was very bad news come of the duke of Ber∣wick's
being prisoner, and of a party's being beat back, that had endea∣voured
to land in Scotland, and that they were so surrounded with Eng∣lish
horse and dragoons, that, if there was any engagement, they could
not shun to fight; and, therefore, begged, that he would go out of the
way, for a time, till better news should come. On all which, the viscount
thought sit to return to Badenoch. Most of my lord Dumfermling's
people, save himself (who continued still very fixt) and the duke of
Gordon's horsemen, being wearied and near their own houses, went
home, without leave; the Highlanders thinking themselves masters, grew
very disorderly, and plundered, without distinction, wherever they came.
The viscount fell sick, which gave boldness to the disorderly and dis∣heartened
others. The first day he marched back, he made a long march,
M'Kay sent a party of horse, who seized some of the duke of Gordon's
gentlemen that went off, and some of the plundering stragglers; but
never came in sight of the rear-guard. The next two days, the viscount
did not march six miles in all; and M'Kay's foot came not within ten
miles of his: but, in the evening of the last day, he sent up a party of
200 horse and dragoons, who, led on by Grant, were brought upon a
party of the M'Leans, scattered a mile asunder, seeking meal. The
horse came up upon them at the full gallop, having got some advertise∣ment.
About one hundred of them got together; and finding them∣selves
on a plain, they run near half a mile, till they gained the foot of
a hill, where they stood and fired upon the enemy, who, in the disorder,
having killed two or three, and seized their baggage, thought they had
nothing to do but knock them all down; so got above them and sur∣rounded
them, which the M'Leans perceiving, threw by their guns,
drew their swords, attacked the enemy boldly, killed the English officers
that commanded, and eleven more, wounded many, and forced the rest
to retire. Night being then come, the scattered M'Leans joined the
rest. My lord Dundee, marching towards them, the next morning early,
met Lochbuy and all his party, who had not lost above four of his men,
<PB N="357" REF="375"/>
and the baggage, and two old men and boys, who were with it. Then
the lord Dundee marched to Ruthven in Badenoch, where he learned,
that Ramsay had come back, with 1100 foot and 100 horse, had passed
to Inverness; that my lord Murray had come up to Athol, had brought
these men together, and saw Ramsay safe through. The next day, the
viscount was further informed, that Ramsay and M'Kay were joined
and marching towards him, and that there was come to St. Johnston
my lord Angus's regiment and other new troops, and to Dumblain more
of that kind, was resolved to go to Rannoch, and strong ground near the
low countries; but finding that the Lochaber men were going away
every night by fortys and fiftys, with droves or cattle, and finding all
the rest loaden with plunder of Grant's lands, and others would needs go
home, gave way to it, and came into Lochaber with them, dispersed them
all to their respective homes, with orders to be ready within a few days,
if the enemy pursued. If not, to lay still till further orders; and, in
the mean time, sent advertisement to M'Lean, Sir Donald, the captain
of ClanRannald, and M'Leod, to make ready against the rendezvous, who
had not yet come forth. It's believed M'Kay was very glad of the oc∣casion,
his horse being extremely wearied, and so retired to Inverness,
where, on suspicion of correspondence, he seized eight officers of the
Scotch dragoons and sent them prisoners to Edinburgh, with a guard of
300 English horse. The rest of the horse and dragoons are quartered in
the adjacent places for conveniency of grass. Ramsay, with 700 foot,
is sent to Elgin, who summoned Gordon castle to surrender; upon
which Mr. Dumbar, and those that were with him, immediately deserted
the place. There were several hundred bolls of meal there, as well as
at Strathbogie. M'Kay, in the mean time, is causing seize all the meal
in the low countries, and gives it to the soldiers landladies, instead of
ready money: for it is believed, they have not great abundance of it.
My lord Dundee hath continued in Lochaber, guarded only by 200,
commanded by Sir Alexander M'Lean; but being in the heart of Glen∣gairy
and Locheil's lands, he thinks himself secure enough, though he
had not, as he has, the Captain of Clan Rannald with 600 men within
ten miles of him, and M'Lean, Sir Donald, and M'Leod, marching to∣wards
him; so that he can march with near 4000, or refresh in safety
till such time as the state of the affairs of Ireland may allow the King to
<PB N="358" REF="376"/>
send forces to his relief; which, if it please God shall fall out, there is all
appearance of forming a considerable army. Notwithstanding that, the
people are a little disheartened, by the unexpected surrender of the castle
of Edinburgh, which is said was only by despair the duke had of any
relief, though he wanted not from my lord Dundee, by a third hand, all
the encouragement he could give.</P>

<OPENER>Mull, <DATE>June 2d, 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>UPON Tuesday, the 21st of May, Sir Alexander M'Lean embarqued
for the relief of the King's party in Kintyre. At his landing in the
island of Giga, where he found Mr. Neil of Clachalie, his lieutenant
colonel, with two companies of men, who gave account, that, two days
before, Lurip and he had endeavoured to stop the low country forces
from entering Kintyre; they had engaged near Clachan Killcalmanell,
and after facing others for two or three hours, and some party's firing,
Clachalie finding the rebels still encreasing to more than four times his
number, he very handsomely drew off his men, and came safe to Giga.
Lurip took ship for Ireland, without acquainting any with his design;
and Lergie left the castle of Skipnidge, and went for Arran. In this
action Clachalie lost one man, and the rebels seven. In this condition
Sir Alexander found these gentlemen, at his landing in Giga, and imme∣diately
ordered boats to be prepared for securing Lergie's safe retreat to
him, and sent him orders to come to the coast side of Kintyre, where he
should meet him; all which was performed before Friday night, the
27th. Upon Saturday blew a great storm, so that they could not come
to Giga, which they designed, to come in all haste to his Majesty's army
at Lochaber. Lergie gave an account, the rebels were 1500, preparing
<PB N="359" REF="377"/>
boats to invade Giga. Upon Sunday morning early, the wind continu∣ing
to blow in the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quarter.</NOTE> art, Sir Alexander perceives two men of war,
one frigate, and three or four long-boats, making from Ila towards
them, and some boats coming off from Kintyre to meet them. Upon
which, he and the other gentlemen disposed their boats equally in two se∣veral
places, and encouraged their men to a brave resistance, this being
their first action. The two men of war did anchor close within musket∣shot
of both harbours, and had a full view of the small boats; the fri∣gate
continued still under sail, from place to place, with a great long∣boat,
and offered several times to land; but were always beat off. Thus
they continued, firing incessantly, from eight in the morning till eight at
night; about which time, the wind decreasing, Sir Alexander began to
carry away his boats to other places, and two contrary ways, the better
to delude the rebels, and give them the more to do, which was effected
with so much courage of the soldiers, that they carried away their boats,
through showers of cannon and muskets, to the other end of the island,
where they embarqued all their men, and came to Argyle next morning.
In the action, the King's party lost one boat, and two sunk with cannon∣shot,
and one man only wounded. The rebels lost 13 of their men,
above 400 cannon-shot, and their whole plot miscarried.</P>
<P>Upon Monday, Sir Alexander having intelligence, that there was a
rendezvous of the rebels at Kill-Michal of Invereny, within five miles
of Glasrie, he immediately makes towards them, for it was not much
out of his way; but, upon approach, they all fled. Sir Alexander,
with Elchille, encamped there that night, and suffered the soldiers to take
nothing but meat next morning. He continued, with as much expedi∣tion
as possible, to come up to my lord Dundee; and landed just now
here, with the other gentlemen in the boats, and brought all his men
safe to this place.</P>
<P>The soldiers are hearty and eager to see my lord Dundee, and suffer
hunger and want of sleep, with great patience, to come up, and are in
hopes to be transported to Morven, to-morrow or Sunday.</P>
<P>Badinoch, the 4th June.—Just now arrived here Sir Alexander
M'Lean, with Mr. Neal of Calchalic, and the laird of Lergie, where
they met his excellency my lord Dundee, on his way to Lochaber; who,
<PB N="360" REF="378"/>
thereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> dismissed the rest of his army to be refreshed at home, keep∣ing
only with himself Sir Alexander's party and a few horse, until news
from his Majesty and the next rendezvous. Three days ago, a party of
major general M'Kay's horse and dragoons, with six score horse, fell upon
a party of M'Lean's men, commanded by Lochbuy, who was upon a
party, about half a mile from the army. The M'Leans took themselves
to a hill, and lost their baggage in the retreat, whereupon they took their
ground and fell in pell-mell with the rebels, sword in hand, and broke
them, chasing them for a good way. In this notable action, the rebels
lost their chief officers, who were killed upon the place, viz. the cap∣tain,
who was an Englishman of considerable note, and much regretted
by the rebels. His name we have not known as yet. Himself with a
lieutenant and 15 others were left dead upon the place; and the
M'Leans carried the horse and arms, &amp;c. to the camp. Lochbuy lost
five of his men.</P>
<P>Lochaber, June 23d.—Yesternight arrived at the camp, Mr. Hay,
from Ireland, with express from his Majesty, which gave great joy to his
Majesty's army here. We have also accounts from several places, that
his Majesty's fleet have secured their coasts and have taken, or sunk, or
chased all the rebels' ships from hence. My lord Dundee is now draw∣ing
his forces together again, and resolves to march from this in a few
days.</P>

Moy, in Lochaber, <DATE>June 27th, 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“I Was not a little surprized to find, by yours, that my name has been
made use of, for carrying on designs against you. Mr. Carleton is
extremely in the wrong, if he says I gave him any commission to the
King, or warrant to say any thing to him, in my name. Earl Bredalbin
<PB N="361" REF="379"/>
sent him to me, with a credential, which he desired me to burn so soon
as I had read it. I had never seen the man in the face before, nor
heard of him. He was not two hours in my company; and, when he
gave me account of his pretended business to Ireland, I disliked most of
it, as I signified to you, by M'Swyne; nor did I give him so much as
a line with him, that I remember. I leave you to judge, if it be pro∣bable,
that I would intrust myself so far to any in such circumstances, as
to employ him in so nice and dangerous a point as that is, of accusing
so great a man, and so much my friend as you are, to the King. If I
had any such design, I would rather have trusted myself to the King,
and written frankly to himself. I will assure you, all my endeavours to
lay you aside were only to yourself. I thought myself bound in duty to
the King and friendship to you, not to dissemble to you the circum∣stances
you stand in with the generality of this country and many in the
neighbouring. Your merit and rising fortune has raised envy; your
favour with the King is crime enough with his enemies, and I am
feared, even with his ambitions friends, which I am sure can never be
imagined to be one with me: for I can never have any pretensions in
your way. Besides, you have contributed to all the considerable steps of
my fortune; but I must tell you, that besides these generals, there are
many pretend to have received disobligations from you and others, no
doubt, with design on your employment; yet the most universal pretext
is, the great hand you had in carrying on matters of religion, as they say,
to the ruin of the King and country. I must tell you, I heard a great
resentment against you, for advising the giving the bulls for the bishops,
and I am feared they themselves believe it. You know what the church
of England is in England; and, both there and here, they generally say,
that the King of himself is not disposed to push matters of religion, or
force people to do things they scrupled in conscience; but that you, to
gain favour with these of that religion, had proved and prevailed with
him, contrary to his inclination to do what he did, which has given his
enemies occasion to destroy him and the monarchy. This being, as I
assure you it is, however unjust, the general opinion of these nations, I
thought, in prudence, for your own sake as well as the King's, you
would have thought it best to seem to be out of business for a time; that
the King's business might go the smoother, and all pretext be taken away
<PB N="362" REF="380"/>
for rebellion; and this only, in case the King find difficulties in his
affairs: for I am obliged to tell you, that, if the people take umbrage
as to their religion, it will be, notwithstanding of all the foreign aid,
a long war. But I think you may come over; and, when you have seen
the state of affairs on the place, and spoke with every body, you may
think what will be best for you to do. You desire me to recommend a
proper man to be secretary. You know it is hard to do. But, if you
really resolve not to seem to meddle, I would, were I you, advise the
King to employ one, to be turned out when things altered, would not
much disoblige, or could have no consequence. But I think I have said
enough, if not too much of this.</P>
<P>My lord, I have given the King, in general, account of things here;
but to you I will be more particular. As to myself, I have sent you it
at large. You may by it understand a little of the state of the country.
You will see there, when I had a seen advantage, I endeavoured to profit
on it; but, on the other hand, shunned to hazard any thing, for fear of
a ruffle: for the least of that would have discouraged all. I thought, if
I could gain time, and keep up a figure of a party, without loss, it was
my best, till we got assistance, which the enemy got from England every
day. I have told the King, I had neither commission, money, nor am∣munition.
My brother-in-law, Albar, and my wife found ways to get
credit. For my own, nobody durst pay to a traitor. I was extremely
surprised, when I saw Mr. Drummond, the advocate, in Highland habit,
come up to Lochaber to me, and gave account, that the Queen had
sent 2000 l. sterling to London, to be paid to me for the King's service,
and that two more was a coming. I did not think the Queen had
known any thing of our affairs. I received a very obliging letter from
her, with Mr. Crain; but I know no way to make a return. However,
when the money comes, I shall keep count of it, and employ it right.
But I am feard, it will be hard to bring it from Edinburgh. When we
came first out, I had but fifty pound of powder; more I could not get;
all the great towns and sea-ports were in rebellion, and had seized the
powder and would sell none. But I had one advantage, the highland∣ers
will not fire above once, and then take to the broad-sword. But I
wonder, above all things, that, in three months, I never heard from
you, seeing by Mr. Hay, I had so earnestly recommended it to you, and
<PB N="363" REF="381"/>
told of this way by Inverlochie, as sure, if you would not have sent
expresses, we thought you would, at least, have hastened the dispatch of
these we sent. M'Swyne has now been away near two months, and we
know not, if the coast be clear or not. However, I have adventured
to advise Mr. Hay to return streight, and not go farther in the country.
It would have been impossible for him to get through to Edinburgh;
but there was no need. He came not here until the 22d, and they sur∣rendered
on the 13th. It was not Mr. Hay's fault, he was so long a
coming; for there has been two English men of war and the Glasgow
frigates amongst the islands, till of late. For the rest of the letters, I
undertook to get them delivered. Most of the persons to whom they are
directed are either put under bond, or in prison, or gone out of the king∣dom.
The advocate is gone to England, a very honest man, firm be∣yond
belief; and Athol is gone too, who did not know what to do. Earl
Hume, who is very frank, is taken prisoner to Edinburgh; but will be
let out, on security. Earl Bredalbin keeps close in a strong house he
has, and pretends the gout. Earl Errol stays at home; so does Aber∣deen.
Earl Marshal is at Edinburgh; but does not meddle. Earl Lau∣derdale
is right, and at home. The bishops, I know not where they are.
They are now the kirk invisible. I will be forced to open the letter,
and send copies attested to them, and keep the original, till I can find
out our primate. The poor ministers are sorely oppressed over all. They
generally stand right. Duke Queensberry was present at the cross, when
their new mock King was proclaimed; and, I hear, voted for him, tho'
not for the throne vacant. His brother, the lieutenant general, some
say, is made an Earl. He has come down to Edinburgh, and is gone up
again. He is the old man, and has abused me strangely; for he swore
to me to make amends.</P>
<P>Tarbat is a great villain. Besides what he has done at Edinburgh, he
has endeavoured to seduce Locheil, by offers of money, which is under
his hand. He is now gone up to secure his faction, which is melting.
The two Dalrymples and others against Skelmurly, Polwart, Cardross,
Ross, and others, now joined with that worthy prince, duke Hamilton.
M. Douglass is now a great knave, as well as beast, as is Glen∣cairne,
Morton and Eglinton; and even Cassills is gone astray, misled
by Gibby<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet.</NOTE>. Panmure keeps right, and at home; so does Strathmore,
<PB N="364" REF="382"/>
Southesk and Kinnaird. Old Airly is at Edinburgh, under caution; so
is Balcarras and Dunmore. Stormont is declared fugitive, for not ap∣pearing.
All these will break out, and many more, when the King lands,
or any from him. Most of the gentry on this side the Forth, and many
on the other, will do so too. But they suffer mightily in the mean
time, and will be forced to submit, if there be not relief sent very soon.
The duke of Gordon, they say, wanted nothing for holding out, but
hopes of relief. Earl of Dumfermling stays constantly with me, and so
does lord Dunkell, Pitcur, and many other gentlemen, who really de∣serve
well, for they suffer great hardships. When the troops land, there
must be blank commissions sent for horse and foot for them, and others
that will join. There must be a commission of justiciary, to judge all
but landed men; for there would be examples made of some that cannot
be judged by a council of war. They take our people and hang them
up, by their new sheriffs, when they find them straggling.</P>
<P>My lord, I have given my opinion to the King concerning the land∣ing.
I would first have a good party sent over to Inverlochie, about
5000 or 6000, as you have conveniency of boats; of which, as many
horse as conveniently can. About 600 or 800 would do well; but ra∣ther
more; for had I had horse, for all that yet appeared, I would not
have feared them. Inverlochie is safe landing, far from the enemy, and
one may chuse, from thence, to go to Murray by Inverness, or to An∣gus
by Athol, or to Perth by Glencoe, and all tolerable ways. The
only ill is, the passage is long by sea and inconvenient, because of the
island; but, in this season, that is not to be feared. So soon as the boats
return, let them ferry over as many more foot as they think fit to the
Point of Kintyre, which will soon be done; and then the King has all
the boats for his own landing. I should march towards Kintyre, and
meet at the Neck of Tarbitt, the foot, and so march to raise the country,
and then towards the passes of Forth to meet the King, where I doubt
not but we would be numerous. I have done all I can to make them
believe the King will land altogether in the West, on purpose to draw
their troops from the North, that we may the easier raise the country, if
the landing be here. I have said so, and written it to every body; and
particularly, I sent some proclamations to my lady Errol, and wrote to
her to that purpose, which was intercepted and carried to Edinburgh
<PB N="365" REF="383"/>
and my lady taken prisoner. I believe it has taken the effect I designed;
for the forces are marched out of Kintyre, and I am just now informed,
M. G. M'Kay is gone from Inverness by Murray towards Edinburgh.
I know not what troops he has taken with him as yet; but it is thought,
he will take the horse and dragoons, except a few, and most of the
standing forces; which, if he do, it will be a rare occasion for landing
here, and for raising the country. Then, when they hear of that, they
will draw this way, which will again favour the King's landing. Some
think Ely a convenient place for landing, because you have choice of
what side, and the enemy cannot be on both: others think the nearer
Galloway the better, because the rebels will have far to march before
they can trouble you: others think Kirkcudbright, or thereabouts, be∣cause
of that sea for ships, and that it is near England. Nobody ex∣pects
any landing here now, because it is thought you will alter the de∣sign,
it having been discovered; and to friends and all, I give out I do
not expect any. So I am extremely of opinion, this would be an ex∣treme
proper place, unless you be so strong that you need not care
where to land. The truth is, I do not admire their mettle. The land∣ing
of troops will confound them terribly. I had almost forgot to tell
you that P—O—, as they say, has written to his Scotch council,
telling them he will not have his troops any more harrassed following me
through the hills; but orders them to draw to the west, where, he says, a
great army is to land; and, at the same time, gives them accounts, that
eight sail of men of war is coming from Brest, with 15000 men on board.
He knows not whether they are designed for England or Ireland. I beg
you will send an express, before whatever you do, that I may know how to
take my measures; and, if the express that comes knows nothing, I am
sure it shall not be discovered for me. I have told Mr. Hay nothing of
this proposal, nor no man. If there come any party this way, I beg
you, send us ammunition, and three or four thousand arms of different
sorts, some horse, some foot. I have just now received a confirmation of
M'Kay's going South, and that he takes with him all the horse and
dragoons, and all the standing foot; by which I conclude, certainly,
they are preparing against the landing in the West. I entreat to hear
<PB N="366" REF="384"/>
from you as soon as possible; and am, in the old manner, most sincerely,

<P>“AFTER Mr. Hay was dispatched I was informed, that Achtera
and major Farchar's son were landed, so sent and stopt Mr.
Hay and came down here to know what news they brought. I am very
glad to hear by your lordship's, that the King's affairs prosper so well and
that Derry will be soon ours. But I hear it was not on Monday last. I
know not what the matter is; but I would think Mackay's going south
and the troops drawing back from Kintyre towards Edinburgh would
import some alarm they have got. I have so often written over all that
Derry was ours, that now, say what I like they hardly believe, and
when I talk of relief out of Ireland, they laugh at it, though I believe
ere long they will find it earnest, and then our enemy's confusion will be
great. As to the places of landing, I am still of the same mind. For the
number I must leave to the conveniency you have. The only incon∣veniency
of the delay is, that the honest suffer extremely in the low
countrys in the time, and I dare not go down for want of horse, and in
part, for fear of plundering all, and so making enemys, having no pay.
I wonder you send no ammunition, were it but 4 or 5 barrells. For we
have not 20 pound. As to yourself, I have told you freely my opinion
and am still of the same mind. You desire I may tell you your faults▪
I use to see none in my friends, and for to tell you what others find when
I do not believe them were to lose time. But I must tell you many of
them who complained of you, have carried themselves so, that what they
<PB N="367" REF="385"/>
say deserves not much to be noticed. However, they have poisoned the
generality with prejudice against you, and England will, I am afraid, be
uneasier to you than Scotland. It is the unjustest thing in the world,
that not being popular must be an argument to be laid aside by the King.
I do really think it were hard for the King to do it; but glorious for
you, if once you be convinced that the necessity of the King's affairs
requires it, to do it of yourself and beg it of him. But this only, as I said
in my last, in case of great difficulties, and in the way I advised, which
I think the King will not refuse you; I mean as to filling up of the
place; for the King may have enemys, some by your continuing; but
he may put in one who may ruin all, which I am sure, if he gave it to
some that pretends, it would I am afraid certainly fall out. I wonder
you could have the least thought that I would concert with any body
against you, having parted so good friends. I spoke not to Dunmore
since he came from London. I mind not I spoke of you to Bredalbine.
I remember when I was endeavouring to make friends for the King in
the country and in the convention, many did tell me, that there would
be no living if you returned; so when no arguments for you could pre∣vail,
I have, may be, to smooth them, said, that if all were well, you
would be prevailed with not to meddle any more. I would have
written letters of encouragement to all the King has written to from your∣self,
and assured them of your friendship and satisfied them of your real
designs of living and letting live every one in their own way in matters of
religion, which would mightily allay, I think, as to Scotland, and let
them see you do favours to cavaliers and to Protestants, for some steps,
that may be, you was forced to make in favours of these ungrate beasts
the Presbyterians. You gave unhappy umbrage to both the other, but
they were fools; for never will they get one whose family, education,
and inclination, is so cavalier. They long at the King's restoration to
have a Lauderdale to destroy Middleton and poor suffering cavaliers.
Let not this be their plague. I am sure you shall be sure of all my en∣deavours
for to bring the minds of people to reason. If you will allow,
I will say, that though you come to see the King once landed, you design
not to stay, unless you think that you may unbolden your enemys. I give
my humble service to my lady, and am, My Lord,</P>

<P>“THE first engagement was betwixt Sir Alex. M'Leane, with
whom were the lairds of Lergie and Calchillie, in the island of
Giga, betwixt Kintyre and Isla, and a squadrom of the English fleet com∣manded
by captain Ruke, in May last, thus.</P>
<P>Sir Alexander and the aforesaid gentlemen with 400 men were waiting
a fair wind to bring them to the rendesvous appointed by my lord Dun∣dee,
his Majestys lieut. general, and had their small boats close to the
rocks of the island when they were assaulted by the English. The sight
began at 8 o'clock in the morning. The English, thinking to take and
sink the boats, manned six long boats, and under shelter of a yaucht
they came in pell mell amongst the boats, and took a large boat be∣longing
to Sir Alexander, that could not be brought near the shore; but
they were so warmly received by the King's party, that the rebels were
forced to retreat with loss, whereupon the two men of war dropped an∣chor
as close to the boats as they could come, and fired incessantly with
their cannon and small shot from 8 o'clock in the morning until
8 o'clock at night. At which time Sir Alexander divided his boats, and
sent one half of them round the island one way, and with them the
yaucht and small boats engaged. They being thus out of the way, and
the two men of war still at anchor, all the rest of the boats came out upon
them, and in despite of all tire English could do, they brought all safe
away. In this skirmish the loyalists lost one boat, and two sunk, and
one man wounded, but none killed. The rebels had a lieutenant and
14 men killed and a great many wounded.</P>
<P>The next engagement was in that same month, between a party of
Sir John M'Leane's regiment of 120 men, commanded by M'Leane of
Lochbuy, against 200 horse and dragoons, commanded by col. Living∣ston,
wherein the M'Leanes routed the rebels, killed captain Waine, an
Englishman, and 14 of his party, with the loss of five men only.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="387"/>
The battle of Rinrory, in Athol, was the next considerable engage∣ment
after this, which was thus:</P>
<P>The lord Murray, son to the marquis of Athol, having with 1500 men
laid siege to the castle Blair, in Athol, then garrisoned for the King
(thereof the lairds of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Ballechan were officers) and
my lord Dundee being to wait at Lochaber some days for colonel Can∣non
and the Irish regiment and the other officers, who were come from
Ireland to come up to join him; his Excellency sent orders for Sir Alex∣ander
M'Leane (who was then at Cromar in the North, in an expedition
against the master of Forbes and other rebels) to march in all haste to
relieve the garrison of Blair, and there to wait till his Excellency's arrival.
This Sir Alexander so happily performed, that lord Murray was forced
to raise the siege; and major general M'Kay being on his march to se∣cond
lord Murray, my lord Dundee (upon information thereof) made
long marches to prevent him, and arrived at Athol upon the 16th of
July, and next morning was informed, that M'Kay's forlorn of 400 men
were within two miles of the castle, at the Pass of Kilikrankie. Where∣upon
his Excellency commanded Sir Alexander M'Leane, with 400 men,
to march against this party. But they were not a quarter of a mile off
when his lordship was informed, that instead of a party, M'Kay himself
with all his army was at Rinrory, within a mile and a half of him.
Whereupon his lordship commanded the army to march towards the
rebels, resolving, without delay, to fight them. M'Kay's army was drawn
up in eight battalions, consisting of 4500 foot and two troops of horse. My
Lord Dundee's consisted of 2500 foot and one troop of horse. On the
right wing Sir John M'Leane was placed with his regiment in two
battalions. On the lest, was Sir Donald M'Donald's regiment, com∣manded
by his son and Sir George Berkley, in one battalion, and Sir Alex∣ander
M'Leane another battalion, made the lest wing. The main battle
consisted of four battalions, viz. Lochiel's, Glengary, Clanronald, and the
Irish regiment, and the troop of horse commanded by Sir William Wallace.
The officers that came from Ireland divided themselves among the bat∣talions.
The fight began about 5 o'clock at night, Sir Alexander
M'Leane keeping the rebels in action (while my lord was forming the
battle). By debating for advantageous posts, therein he lost only five
men, but the rebels loss was greater. About 8 o'clock, the signal was
<PB N="370" REF="388"/>
given; his lordship, charged in person, upon the head of the horse. The
Highlanders gave such a furious charge as made the rebels give ground
in a moment. For the rebels having spent their fire before the High∣landers
fired, (who kept their shot till they were within pike length of the
enemy), and after fire the royalists falling in with broad swords made the
rebels run. The left wing of M'Kay's army was quite routed by Sir
John M'Leane, who followed the slaughter for a good way. The like
was done by the main battle. But all the opposition to purpose was in
the right wing of the rebels. For Sir Alexander M'Leane, having
routed M'Kay's regiment, his men followed the pursuit so briskly, that
he was left alone himself in the place of battle; and observing colonel
Hasting's regiment of foot standing their ground against Sir Donald M'Do∣nald's
regiment, and at last forcing them to retire, he rallied as many as
he could get of his men, and with Sir Evan Cameron made head towards
the rebels who thereupon fled, and the night put a stop to the
slaughter.</P>
<P>In this battle there were killed of the rebels upon the place 1500, some
say 2000, and the next morning 500 prisoners were brought in by the
men of Athol. Those of note killed, were brigadier Balfour, and lieu∣tenant
colonel M'Kay, brother to the major general, with many more
officers of less note; of the prisoners were lieutenant colonel Balfour,
captain Ferguson, captain Donaldson, and 13 other officers, with all their
camp, tents, baggage, artillery, and provisions, which was of great
value, and also the prince of Orange's standard, carried by M'Kay's re∣giment,
taken by Sir Alexander M'Leane.</P>
<P>Of the royalists were killed (to his Majesty's unspeakable loss) the
lieutenant general himself, (while he was riding to help the confusion he
observed in the left wing, occasioned by the gallant resistance of colonel
Hasting's regiment against Sir Donald and Sir George Berkley,) the lairds
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Largie, captain M'Donald, brother to Glengarie,
captain Ramsay, captain M'Leane, nephew to Sir Alexander, captain
Pollock, brother to the laird of Pollock, and some other officers, but very
few common soldiers. Sir George Berkley and several other gentlemen
were wounded.</P>
<P>Two days after this battle, colonel Cannon, who now commands the
army, sent the laird of Struan with 100 foot and some horse, under the
<PB N="371" REF="389"/>
conduct of major William Graham, to St. Johnstoun, where they were
surprised by some troops of horse of Sir John Lanier's regiment. Major
Graham made off in time. But Struan's men were some in their beds, some
drunk, and some of them were killed, and 25 taken prisoners; the rest
with the laird himself made their escape. This was the beginning of
Cannon's conduct.</P>
<P>The last engagement was about 20 days after this, at Dunkell, where
there was some 800 of the Cameronians, under the command of colonel
Cleaveland and others. Colonel Cannon with the army arrived at Dun∣kell
the 21st of August, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and surrounded the
town, commanding Sir Alexander M'Leane to make the first attack, and
so the Highlanders fell on so furiously that they beat the rebels from the
walls, and helping one another over the walls entered the town. So that
at once the town was set on fire both by them and the rebels, whereby
the town for an hour and a half was very hot on both sides. At last all the
rebels being cut off, except those who got into the castle and the great
church, and the Highlanders having spent their ammunition, retired out
of the town. In this engagement, on the rebels side were killed Cleave∣land
himself and almost all their officers, and 120, some say 200, of their
men. On the King's side were killed two captains of M'Leane's regi∣ment,
and Sir Alexander M'Leane's captain lieutenant, and some other
officers of note, but few soldiers; but there were a great many wounded,
and Sir Alexander M'Leane had his leg broken with a musket bullet, and
was carried to the castle of Blair. But upon some distaste taken by the
clanns at Cannon's conduct, the army broke up and went home; and
now they content themselves with incursions, wherewith they have done
great prejudice to the rebels, and lately went within seven miles of Glas∣gow
and destroyed Kilmarnock, &amp;c.</P>

1200 men. We have not lost full out 900. This absolute victory made
us masters of the field and the enemy's baggage, which I gave to the

<P>UPON the death of the viscount Dundee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1690. February.</NOTE> the spirit of the High∣landers,
who were in arms for James, declined. Colonel Cannon,
who succeeded to the command, was neither loved for his manner, nor
respected for his conduct. The insurgents, however, remained attached
to their principles; and though they retired home for the winter, they
were ready, with the return of summer, to take the field. Major general
Buchan was sent to command them; and the following paper contains a
detail of some particulars after the arrival of that officer in Scotland.</P>

<OPENER>“Dublin, the 14th day of March, 16 89/9<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</OPENER>
<P>“ON the 20th of the last month, Sir George Berkley, Sir Alexander
M'Lane, colonel James Purcell, and Mr. John Hay, set out from
Tubermurray, in the island of Mull and kingdom of Scotland, in his
Majesty's ship the Jennet (that carried major general Buchan thither)
for Sligo, in the west of this kingdom; but, meeting with contrary
winds, put into Killibeg, short of it; which, because of the nearness to
Sligo, they believed was in his Majesty's hands; but soon found their
mistake. There were three of the enemy's ships riding there; and the
Jennet had scarce anchored, when two of their boats came up to her.
In one were the masters of the two ships, their mates and seamen; in the
<PB N="375" REF="393"/>
other, two fishermen only. The first came on board and were secured;
the masters in the cabin, and the men in the hold. The two fishermen
grew jealous, went off, and informed those a-shore, they suspected them.
Whereupon, one captain Watson, captain lieutenant to Tiffany, and
commander in chief of the place, manned and armed three boats very
well; resolving, if enemies, to take them. They received the captain,
and those in his boat, on board, and immediately disarmed them; which,
as soon as the other two boats saw, they fired upon the ship. But his
Majesty, when the ship went off from hence, having ordered a sufficient
number of soldiers on board her, to secure her in her return, they poured
small shot so thick into the boats, that one immediately cried out for
quarter. The other was rowed off by two boys, which made those on
board the Jennet believe the men in it were killed or disabled. They
took, in all, 19 prisoners; two of which were so desperately wounded,
that their lives were despaired of. After this skirmish was over, the wind
blew fresh into the harbour; but abated by twelve at night. Then,
with the help of the boats they took, they warped and towed out of the
harbour, which, in the entrance, is very straight. Some shots were made
at them, next morning, from the shore, which did them no harm; and
a small gale presenting, they got off, and, in two days after, landed at
Broad-haven.</P>
<P>Mr. Hay, brother to Mr. George Hay, who was sent express to the
King by major general Buchan, dispatched immediately away, and ar∣rived
here with his Majesty, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in the morning. He brought
his Majesty two several letters from Buchan: the first is of the 2d of
February at Mull; the last, of the 14th of the same month, at Inver∣lochie.
In the first, he gives an account of the favourableness of his
passage thither; and that the officers, ammunition, cloaths, and money,
sent with him, were safely landed and secured by him: that he intended
to get a good body of men immediately together: that the duke of Ber∣wick's
presence there would be very necessary; and desires, that the
lords Seaforth and Drummond, and all the Scotch to be spared here,
might immediately be dispatched thither. In his second, he tells of a
meeting he has had with the general officers and chiefs of clans, in a
general council of war, (in pursuance of his Majesty's commission to
that purpose) where a general letter to his Majesty was conceived and
<PB N="376" REF="394"/>
subscribed by them all, which he covered to the King. In it, they gave
fresh assurances of their adherence to his Majesty and royal interest;
and promise to continue to do as they began, and expose their lives and
fortunes, and all that is dear and near to them, for his Majesty's re-esta∣blishment.
They beseech his Majesty to send the duke of Berwick,
with some horse and dragoons, to head them, which, they say, will
enable them to make a descent into the low lands, where they do not
question to meet many of his Majesty's friends who will join them; and
add, that they have pitched upon Sir George Berkley, to give an ac∣count
of their present condition, and desire he may be immediately sent
back to them. The major general further adds, that he has already
had private messages from considerable persons there, and desires com∣missions
for colonels and lieutenant colonels of horse and foot, for some
noblemen he names, together with some blank ones for others. Besides
what he writes, and the general letter, his Majesty has had particular
ones from several of the chiefs of clans, which are full of dutiful and
loyal expressions. Mr. Hay, that, some time before his embarking,
came out of the low lands, has brought the present establishment there,
as to civil and military employments, a list of the prince of Orange's
troops in that kingdom, the order of council for sequestring the estates
of the loyalists; and has given so good an account of all things to the
King, that he has pitched upon him to carry his Majesty's letters to the
Queen, and sets out for Cork this very day.”</P>

<P>SINCE my first letter, at my landing, I had a meeting with the chiefs
of clans; and they have written to your Majesty and cousin Sir
George Berkley, to give a true account of what is passed, and of the
present condition they are in; they will not have any from a particular
clan to come over, but an indifferent person, whom they all esteem, as
they do the bearer, as much as any that has been amongst them. My
<PB N="378" REF="396"/>
lord Bredalbin has sent a gentleman to me, and professes very much;
yet, for what I can learn underhand, he is not to be trusted. There are
several of the clans, for all their promises, that have been treating with
the prince of Orange; and my lord Tarbat lies, like a banquire at Lon∣don,
buying off all he can. I have seen of his letters. There is 1000<HI>l.</HI>
offered Lochiel, and to pay off all his debts; so that, unless your Ma∣jesty
give speedy succour, I fear the most of them.</P>
<P>The officers that came out of Ireland were very miserable; so I, with
consent of the council of war, have given out the 500<HI>l.</HI> amongst them.
There is some of the clergy have been with me, desiring to know what
length your Majesty would go with them for their religion. I told them,
that was truly a point not for me to answer; but desired they might send
some person they might trust to speak to your Majesty about it. It will
be necessary to please that gang, and to send over some blank commis∣sions,
for colonels and lieutenant colonels of horse and foot: for there
are several noblemen in the low country desire commissions; as the earls
of Errol, Strathmore, Panmure, and some others. These people will
never raise, till the duke of Berwick comes over. There is a report,
that my lord of Arran will join us; but I do not trust it. I must re∣commend
Lochiel to your Majesty. Your Majesty will see, by his billet,
what he desires; and he rules the Highlanders more than any Scotch∣man
does; and likewise Stewart of Ballachant-Billet, who is a very for∣ward
man, and John Drummond of Machonie. I beg of your Majesty,
that Sir George Berkley may be put upon his allegiance to give your
Majesty a true account of every one. He is an honest, loyal man, and
knows much more than I can write; and it will be very fit that he be
dispatched back again; for the Highlanders have a high esteem for him,
and it will conduce very much to your Majesty's service, that he have a
commission for brigadier, which will please extremely all the loyal party.
I would write much more, but refer all to him; so, wishing the Heavens

<P>Many persons in Scotland who had declared early for the prince of
Orange, and acknowledged his title as King, expected exorbitant rewards
for their services, but finding themselves disappointed, they began to make
their peace with James, and to concert measures for his restoration. The
Highlanders, when abandoned by colonel Cannon, who succeeded Dundee
in the command of the forfeited King's adherents, chose Sir Evan Cameron
of Lochiel for their commander; and, when reinforced by Buchan and the
officers whom James sent with ammunition and provisions from Ireland,
<PB N="380" REF="398"/>
they took arms to second Sir James Montgomery's intrigues in parliament.
They were repulsed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> rather than defeated, by Sir Thomas Livingston in
the county of Murray, and by major Ferguson in the island of Mull: and
the conspiracy in which Montgomery had engaged all the discontented
nobility and gentlemen in the kingdom, was discovered by himself to the
earl of Melvil; and by the earl of Annandale to Queen Mary. But
before this happened, the conspirators had begun to correspond with the
exiled Queen in France, and with James in Ireland. The first mention
made of their designs in Nairne's papers, is in the letters which Melfort
wrote to his master from Paris, and to the Queen from Toulon.</P>
<P>The Scots made certain conditions with James, and prepared to re∣store
him in a parliamentary way to his kingdoms; and the most rigid
Jacobites being under no restraints from conscience, made use of their
master's permission to qualify themselves to vote in parliament, by taking
the oaths to the government. But it is probable that James placed no
confidence in the offers of the Presbyterians; and Melfort, at this des∣perate
crisis, was as anxious to avoid any concessions which might imply a
diminution of the prerogative, as when his master was firmly seated on
the throne of his ancestors. He discovers a great deal of this spirit in
the following memorial, which contains, at once, proofs of insincerity
and marks of weakness.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Nairne's hand.</HEAD>
<P>“HAving seen a paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. 1. fol. No. 84.</NOTE> containing some proposals for the bringing
back the kingdom of Scotland to their duties and allegiance to
his Majesty, I thought it my duty to make such reflections upon it, as
might be for the clearing of the state of the case, and the consequences
of their demands; of which the substance is:</P>
<P>That it is most certain, that the party now desiring to treat, was that
party which gave the usurper the crown, and have used all the means
possible to gain their ends with him. So that it is not kindness to the
King, but to play their own game better, which moves this offer; they
seeing a church of England parliament, their mortal enemies, in all places
of trust about the usurper, and persecutions coming on them, instead
<PB N="381" REF="399"/>
of that happiness they proposed to themselves by the change. But this
should be no hinderance, if their demands were tolerable, which, in
reason, the King might expect, considering that they have no resource
but in him; and that they must be against the prince of Orange, it be∣ing
their own interest, as well as his.</P>
<P>As to the first demand of an act of indemnity, it is absolutely neces∣sary,
and to be as extensive as the King with safety can make it; and
these exceptions proposed seem to be most reasonable. But, besides these,
it is to be considered, that such as have formerly been pardoned for high
treason once, do not seem fit objects for the King's mercy; nor such,
whose families seem to have been hereditably so, except where, by some
new service, they merit more favour; and this I do not find they stick
at, to let the King make the exceptions; and I am of opinion there are
many who should be included for their lives and fortunes, who should
not as to their honour; that so the King may, without augmenting the
number of the peers of every rank, have wherewithal to gratify such as
have eminently served him; and that exception of honours go to such
as have pretended to serve him and did not, as well as to such as have
been his open enemies.</P>
<P>As to the proposition of a parliament, it seems to be the most dangerous
expedient in the world for the crown. All yet done is void and null, and
there is nothing can support it but a chain of force, as illegal and un∣just
as that which made it. But, if the King consent to a parliament,
whatever is there done, his commissioners being there present, though
contrary to his instructions, though it will not be licit, yet will be va∣lidly
done; and, therefore, it is not a right matter to name a man in
open rebellion to be a commissioner. It is an act the King may do, but it
is not for any to advise him in it; and, besides, it would seem too great
a condescension for the King to make, for so small assurances as he is
to have on their part, which amounts only to simple endeavours, and such
as if the prince of Orange let not the parliament meet, their very fun∣damental
project will be out of doors; it consisting all in turning the
parliament into a convention.</P>
<P>The acts they propose are such as may strengthen their authority with
the people, and may be a bait for them to catch at; and, I suppose,
<PB N="382" REF="400"/>
they mean them for no other end at present; because it seems they
would print and disperse them. If that be all, then it would appear to
me, that a declaration of the King's, to assure them what he will do for
them, may be as sufficient as the instructions, and less dangerous. If
they intend to call a convention, without the prince of Orange's au∣thority,
which they must do, or have none, in all likelihood, then it
were fit, that they admitted the duke of Berwick, or earl of Perth,
whom, for that end, they may relieve, to assure them of the King's in∣tention,
so soon as he can see them, or safely hold a parliament there;
and, in the mean time, to grant them the indemnity, liberty of con∣science,
and such other things as may with safety be done, leaving them
to rely on the King for something, as he must on them for much honesty
and fidelity he must presuppose them to have. And it is but reason∣able,
that these who have broken all oaths and ties, should rather trust
to him, who has ever kept his truth, than that he, who has never failed,
should trust to them who have, and are his subjects too.</P>
<P>The acts are such as the King can give no instructions in, with any
sort of safety, till he see them.</P>
<P>As first, That act for settling the protestant religion may be such, as
in conscience the King cannot consent to. It may have clauses in it,
which may destroy the being of the monarchy or person of the King,
in case of being any way, as they think, incroached upon by him. It
may give an authority to the people to inquire into the King's actions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These things, though they seem a lesser ill than what the King now
suffers, yet I look on it as entirely greater. The violence of this usurp∣ation
threatens its being short-lived; and God, in his justice, will throw
out these workers of iniquity, and, in his mercy, restore the King; and,
if he have not consented to any thing prejudicial to the monarchy, he
will get intire; whereas a condescension once made, seems impossible to
be retrieved again.</P>
<P>That act for not keeping up a standing army, is to put the King in
the people's power, which they have not used so in times past, as to en∣courage
the King to trust them in times to come; and for the King to
go on these terms, or not to go at all, seems much the same thing, if
the first be not by much the worst; and I am in the mind the King will
not condescend to it.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="401"/>
As that his Catholick servants should be approved in parliament,
that's of no consequence to be stuck at on any account. If it had been
so still, we had been more secure, and, in my judgment, the King had
been allowed whatever he had asked; but if that extend to officers, it
is of the nature of the other act, and the King I believe will never
grant it.</P>
<P>That Act, rescinding all forfeitures since 1660, is against all law and
the security of the crown. For no man will dread any just sentence.
But yet it should not be stuck at, if it can help the King's business on.
It may have such exceptions in it, as may be fit that many of the King's
own friends may not be forfeited, instead of his enemies: a thing has ever
been aimed at, by the discontented party, to make men weary of their
duty and loyalty. So that, to propose the matter right, they should
have said, at least, The parliament giving compensation to such as shall
be injured by such an act. Though, at the same time, I renounce all
interest I have in them, so soon as the King shall let me know it is for his
interest I do it. But this act requires long time; for many forfeitures
are sold and many bought, by the relation of the person forfeited: so
that it would require time to adjust such an act, so as to make it as just
as can be; and it should be well adjusted with the King's friends, lest
they be alarmed by it and disheartened; and so like the fable of Aesop,
we lose the substance aiming at the shadow.</P>
<P>Let this gentleman say what he will, this is not only to hamper but to
fetter the King; and, therefore, the true consideration is, if the King be
in such a case, as that he must accept on any terms, which, according to
my weak capacity, he is not yet reduced to; and that, therefore, he
may very well propose his terms as they have done theirs, and ride these
gentlemen with a good bridle hand, not giving them too much reins,
lest they run away with him and throw him again, nor too little, lest they
choak and renverse with him.</P>
<P>This riddle is what it requires most wisdom, and more experience
than I am master of to find out; yet I could not be wanting to give the
insight I can, for the service of such as I esteem above all worldly things;
and therefore I think:</P>
<P>That this party, being disobliged by the prince of Orange, flys to the
King, and asks high terms. If they can get them, they gain; however,
<PB N="384" REF="402"/>
they lose nothing to propose them, though, at the same time, they must
accept of what the King offers them, if that weighs down in one grain
what they expect from the prince of Orange. For a proof of this, they
have put their lives into the King's hands, without any precaution, which
they would not have done but in two cases.</P>
<P>The first, to cheat the King and get these condescensions, with the
prince of Orange's consent. This they are not in terms to effectuate;
and, therefore, it must be the second: That they are so ill used, that
they think they were better before the prince of Orange came than they
are now; and, if that, then a state near about what they then enjoyed
will satisfy them, in other demands they be never so extravagant.</P>
<P>If, therefore, it be possible for the King to satisfy them with reasonable
promises, and once to get them entered in action, they will do the King's
work, and whilst the prince of Orange and they are struggling for the
bone, leave the King the liberty of growing strong enough to take it
from them both, and to give as he shall see reasonable afterwards. For,
if once they begin a war, it will not then be so much minded, what
terms they are to expect from the King, who is to assist them, as how
they shall overthrow the power of the present enemy.</P>
<Q>[What follows is in Melfort's hand.]</Q>
<P>Who gains time, gains life; and, therefore, the King should shew
them all the kindness, all the trust, all the confidence in the world; write
most affectionately to them, seem to grant even more than he intends to
perform; but, in the mean time, delay, and a good reason of delay of
such acts as he cannot grant is, to see them penned and sent him. Such
as he can grant, to assure them of them with all chearfulness, and brag
extremely of what assistance he will send them, and that they shall have
all content. Naturally they are hot and unwarie, and not able to brook
the present pressure of the prince of Orange, as appears by their uneasy
messenger's stories; that they can hardly be kept in, and consequently, if
encouraged by the King, will break out; which, once begun, and the
Highlanders advertised to take the same opportunity, then all will be
past their helping, and the King's promises be at his own disposal, at the
time and in the manner he shall think fit. Besides the likelihood it may
stop the usurper's designs upon Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="403"/>
But above all things, he must promise favours to such, as shall enter∣tain
this matter, and that they shall be in posts to see their people pro∣tected,
&amp;c. whatever reasons to the contrary may be gathered from
their past carriages.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to send back this messenger contented to his
principals; and that he may be instructed in what may be of most use to
begin with, as seizing the castles, a thing easy for them to do, by sur∣prize;
seizing good hostages on the prince's side, &amp;c. God Almighty
inspire the King, and send him such as may be serviceable to him in this
conjuncture; neither losing all the assistance of his enemies, nor endan∣gering
his royalty.</P>
<P>It appears from the following preamble of a declaration, that James
always expressed himself too ambiguously to satisfy even those who had
formed a conspiracy to restore him to his throne.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, by several declarations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D N. vol. i. fol. No. 94.</NOTE> we have endeavoured to give
our good subjects all satisfaction, as to the sincerity of our inten∣tions,
for settling the nation in peace and prosperity, hoping, thereby, to
have removed all apprehensions and fears of our invading their religion,
liberty, or property. But finding, by experience, that the said declara∣tions
did not produce those good effects we expected from them, but ra∣ther
dissatisfied the greatest part of our people, although they contained
only the substance of such heads and proposals as had, from time to
time, been offered to us by several very considerable persons and parties
of our said subjects (who did at the same time assure us, that, if we would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondescend to such proposals as they offered, and which were mentioned
in the said declarations, our restoration should immediately follow); we,
therefore, upon mature consideration, are convinced, that the only sure
way left to know truly the sense of the nation, and to satisfy all parties,
will be, to defer the descending into particulars till we meet with the re∣presentatives
of all our subjects in a free parliament; with whom we
promise, upon our royal word, to advise and readily to concur in all
things, that can, in reason, be expected from us, for the general satisfac∣tion
of our people, in all that may relate to their religion, liberty, pro∣perty, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>1691.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER the VIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691. January.</NOTE> after he was advanced to the Roman
pontificate, wrote an affectionate letter to the late King of England.
He exhorted him to patience and perseverance, and promised him the
assistance of prayers and money for his restoration. But he carried ne∣potism
to as great a length as any of his predecessors, and probably
squandered too much money in aggrandizing his own family, to be able
to send any more effectual aid than chaplets and indulgencies to James.
He died on the 1st of February, 1691, and on the 12th of July Innocent
XII. was elected in his room. This Pope is supposed, before the end
of his pontificate, to have been liberal to James; but it does not appear
that he sent him supplies at this time, as there is a blank in lord Mel∣fort's
negociations at Rome. Since December, 1689, there are but two
of his memorials among Mr. Nairne's Papers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 83.</NOTE> The one is in Italian,
and marked on the back, “The fifth memorial on the 2d of March.”
The year is not mentioned. The other is in French and in Italian, and
it is marked on the back of the Italian copy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 80, 81.</NOTE> that it was delivered to the
Pope (Innocent the XII.) on the 22d of August, 1691. In both these
memorials he asks money, and recommends a peace among the Roman
Catholic princes, in the same strain as in his memorial of December
1689.</P>
<P>By this time James had recalled lord Melfort from Rome; for the
letter he wrote then to Innocent is dated the 30th of July 1691.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 85.</NOTE> He had
higher expectations now, from the divisions among his old subjects at
home, than from the assistance of foreign princes; and he entered into
a correspondence with those, who had formed a conspiracy against the
government. The following paper relates to the intrigues of this period:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Mr. Nairne's hand.</HEAD>
<P>YOU shall, with the first conveniency, after your arrival in England,
go to your loyal friends in the North, and from the King com∣mand
their zeal for his service. Give his royal thanks for what they
have done; and let them know, that it is his Majesty's pleasure they
keep themselves in the best readiness they can for his service. That they
think of the best way of arming themselves, in case his Majesty find,
during the course of this campaign, means of coming to them; and that
they come to join him, as soon as conveniently they can, after the pub∣lication
of his Majesty's declaration.</P>
<P>That you go to the earl of Hume, and to such friends as you know
in Northumberland, and endeavour to contrive the surprising of Ber∣wick;
and that they give the King an account, when they have it in
their power, and execute it when his Majesty shall order, or that they
shall hear some sure good news to encourage them to it. That they, in
like manner, try, if it be possible, to seize Newcastle and Tinmouth.</P>
<P>That, in the meantime, they behave themselves with that prudence,
which may preserve them from being imprisoned, dismounted, or dis∣armed.</P>
<P>That they be ready, at the first warning, to take arms; and that they
be careful, so soon as our declaration comes amongst them, to spread it
about in all places; and that they cause reprint it, where they have con∣veniency,
and where they have it not, that they cause written copies to
be dispersed, and that they proclaim our authority, wherever they pass or
have power.</P>
<P>That they endeavour to hearten all our subjects; and, that thorough
such places as it will be necessary for them to pass, they keep exact dis∣cipline,
and pay for what they get.</P>
<P>And, besides all other favours we shall do to such as appear for us,
we shall, in the first place, refund what they shall have laid out in this
our service.</P>
<P>You shall lay out to all our faithful subjects you have occasion to con∣verse
with on this account, the sense we have of their loyalty, the joy
<PB N="388" REF="406"/>
we shall have to see them, and the unalterable resolutions we have to
reward them. That, if any of your friends in Northumberland have
correspondence in the borders of Scotland, they inform them of what is
proper on this head, that they may likewise prepare for the first adver∣tisement
or sure good news to take arms.</P>
<P>Major Holmes went to France in October 1691,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> and gave a memorial
to the King immediately upon his arrival at Fountainbleau. This memo∣rial
is not among Mr. Nairne's papers. But there is a paper, in Holmes's
own hand, containing some particulars which he had forgot. It is indorsed
in lord Melfort's: “Major Holmes's paper, given in October 1691.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">“Memorials from Mr. Ferguson.”</HEAD>
<P>“THERE is an impeachment designed against the bishop of Salis∣bury,
bishop of St. Asaph, and dean of St. Paul's, in parliament, for
persuading the clergy to take the oaths to the prince of Orange as a con∣queror.</P>
<P>Another impeachment designed against my lord Danby, for declaring
no King could reign in England, whilst the act of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was in
force, and a great instrument for the clergy's taking the oaths as above
written. There is many of the King's friends would gladly have the
general excise to pass freely in parliament, in hopes that the King may
come to the receiving of it. There are others of his Majesty's friends of
another opinion, that the less money granted in parliament is a good
way to the breaking of the confederacy. The parliament will have an
exact account of the money already given, and how it was spent. There
are several of the King's friends, that are much of the opinion, that,
when it shall please God that the King shall land in England, immedi∣ately
after or about the time of the landing, the loyalists in London or
thereabouts join all in a body, attack his guards, and seize the prince of
Orange and princess, with some of the head rogues in their government,
and bring them streight to the King's camp. That the cessation of arms,
made by the earl of Bredalbin and major general Buchan, with the rest
of the officers and heads of the clans, was both honourable and advan∣tageous
for the King's service; but that lord is not to be trusted by no
<PB N="389" REF="407"/>
King, further than his own interest leads him. It is a very necessary
thing, that speedy supplies be sent to the Highlands, both to the officers
and clans. It will take air and spread, that there is some care taken of
those poor souls, that hath been in a manner starving for want of things
fitting for mankind, and will be a great encouragement to the low coun∣try
in order to their duty. It is very proper 2000 l. be sent to them,
with some other necessaries. Brest is the place, which is thought fittest
for those wants to be sent from; and to land on the isle of Sky, or island Donald.</P>
<P>That the King come not in person to Scotland; but to send the duke
of Berwick and my lord Dumbarton, with 10,000 men, with arms and
furniture for 5000 horses and dragoons more, and 10,000 stand of arms
for foot.</P>
<P>That no considerable sum of money be sent to Scotland to a poor no∣bility,
that will undoubtedly quarrel about the dividing of it. But when
the army is sent, to send money with it, and put it into a trusty com∣missioner's
hands, that will employ it for the use of the army, and will
be answerable for it.</P>
<P>My lord Dumbarton is very fit for this expedition, his lordship
being generally beloved by all the people in Scotland, since he last com∣manded
there, and quashed that rebellion with so little blood, and is
very much beloved in England likewise.</P>
<P>Arran to command as third lieutenant general. He answers, body
for body, for Argyle and Athol.</P>
<P>It's proper Athol, Hume, and Argyle, have the characters of lieute∣nant
generals. It's a feather in their hats, to make them more forward
to raise their men conform to their character.</P>
<P>If the King could land in England, with 15,000 men, either in the
West, about Lancaster, or in the North, he will be joined by more than
the number he brings along him; and, with God's assistance, march
peaceably to Whitehall.</P>
<P>The author of those memorials will be as soon on horse-back, as any
man in England with his printer.</P>
<P>The King's friends are very confident that there shall be a very fair
fire about him in parliament; and, if he should take Danby in his arms,
<PB N="390" REF="408"/>
they will pull him out; that it's not in their power to protect him; and
it's assuredly known, that Halifax or Rochester will succeed.—The King's
friends desire to know, which of the two his Majesty most desires to fill
his place. There is many, that is come in to the King's interest, that he
hath not power to name their names as yet; but will do it as soon as he
hath their leave. Sir Charles Owesley is come intirely into the King's
interest.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is mortally hated by the English. They see
very fairly, that he hath no love for them, neither doth he confide in
them; but all in his Dutch. It's certainly known he hath brought over
a great many foreigners this summer, and it's not doubted but the par∣liament
will not be for foreigners to ride them with a caveson; and its
mightily in their heads, that those foreigners were brought over to noose
the parliament. He is cursed daily, by those of his council, his bed∣chamber,
and others that hath very good employments under him.</P>
<P>The story of Sir William Sharp being with the princess of Orange and
Nottingham is false,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marginal note in Lord Melfort's hand.</NOTE> and nothing but a malicious invention of Sir James
Montgomerie and Jones against Sir William;<NOTE PLACE="marg">“Addition received the 10th of March, 1692, St. Germains.”</NOTE> and that those idle and
wicked inventions diseased the King's friends at a strong rate, and it was
impossible that they could be easy until they were both on the other side,
meaning France, and only there to remain still to prevent further
jealousies.</P>
<P>Some months before I came from England, Sir James Montgomerie
asked Mr. Ferguson's advice to take employment under the prince of
Orange, that he might be in a better condition to serve the King. Mr.
Ferguson told him, he should never give his advice to any such thing,
and further told me, that Sir James had been with the princess of Orange
quietly, and from that time until my coming into France, they never had
any meeting.</P>

<HEAD>1692.</HEAD>
<P>KING James had lost the battle of the Boyne in July, 1690, and
before he arrived in France the Scotish and English conspirators had
been seized, and the French King had entirely relinquished his project of
invading Britain. It was resumed, however, from time to time. The
enemies of William and of his government, were continually offering
their services to the excluded King. An invasion of Britain was repre∣sented,
as the infallible means of restoring James to his kingdoms, and
of continuing the progress of the French conquests in Flanders. Besides
the 5000 Irish which James sent to France, by the transports that carried
back an equal number of French troops into Ireland; there were 14,000
of the same nation sent over next year, at the expence of the English
government, according to the capitulation which general Ginckle had
granted to them, upon the surrender of Limeric. Before they arrived,
Lewis XlVth began to think seriously of an invasion, and having desired
the opinion of James, received the following memorial. It is in the earl
of Melfort's hand.</P>
<Q>“<HI>A memorial to Lewis</HI> XIV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 89</NOTE> <HI>by James</HI> II. <HI>delivered a little time before
the arrival of the troops from Ireland, towards the end of the year</HI>
1691.”</Q>
<P>After the general title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. 91. and D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 11.</NOTE> “Memoires writ by E. Melfort, at St. Ger∣mains,
after his return from Rome;” the English copy of lord Mel∣fort's
draught for this Memorial is intituled, “Proposition for a landing
in Scotland, end of December, 1691, or the beginning of January, 1692,
before the business of La Hogue.” The French copy is the most exact,
and is therefore followed in this abridgment.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="395" REF="413"/>
<HEAD>Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“YOUR Majesty,” says James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1692. January.</NOTE> “having asked ME, if the employ∣ing
the troops expected from Ireland to make a descent in Scot∣land,
would be the means of diverting the arms of the prince of Orange,
it appears to me, to be a thing very practicable. And your Majesty
having desired me to propose what I think necessary for that design, I
shall, leaving always to your Majesty to determine what you think fit,
make the following proposals.”</P>
<P>His proposals were, that the French King should secretly provide a
fleet and transports. Besides the troops that were to come from Ireland,
he should employ a requisite number of HIS troops, which were already
in the French service, and provide arms and horses for 500 troopers and
1000 dragoons. That he should send arms for 2000 horse and 1000 dra∣goons,
to equip such as were ready to take arms upon the first notice of
HIS landing, and the necessary number of arms for the infantry, which
might be raised in the low country. That a train of artillery, however
small, was necessary, with warlike stores, provisions, and money, for a
specified time.</P>
<P>When these things were prepared, the best place from which they
could embark, appeared, he said, to be Brest, Belleisle, or Rochfort, and the
best rout through the Irish channel to the firth of Clyde. Its vicinity to
the town of Glasgow, the goodness of the anchorage, and the plentiful∣ness
of the adjoining country, rendered between Air and Irvine the most ad∣vantageous
place for landing. But if the prince of Orange, by his vigi∣lance,
which was not probable, should prevent their landing there,
Dumbarton was the most proper place. The army should march with
the greatest dispatch to Edinburgh, in order to publish the King's au∣thority
and assume the government; a measure which would elevate the
spirits of the royal party and dishearten the rebels.</P>
<P>In the mean time, care should be taken to encourage HIS friends, as
well in England as in Scotland, to put themselves in a condition to be
useful upon that occasion. The Highlanders should be warned to be
in readiness to take arms on the first notice; and HIS friends in the low
country should have notice to be in a condition to do him the best ser∣vice,
but with that secrecy which the importance of the affair required.
<PB N="396" REF="414"/>
His friends in England should likewise be warned to seize the first fa∣vourable
opportunity, on the first notice of good news, of assembling
where they could maintain themselves with safety and make the greatest
diversion.</P>
<P>That the troops, if successful, should march immediately into England,
and join the loyalists of that kingdom. That his friends in the North of
England, should be warned to seize Newcastle, not only on account of
the riches of that commercial city, but because London could not sub∣sist
without the coals which it sends thither. That if Plymouth, or any
other place of strength, could be seized in England, the French King
should send 4 or 5000 men to its assistance, in order to made a consider∣able
diversion to the arms of the prince of Orange.—“I am of opinion,
that, if this affair is prepared with the secrecy, and executed with the vi∣gour
it ought, though it may fail to set ME upon my throne, yet it can∣not
miss to divert entirely the arms of the prince of Orange for this cam∣paign,
and consequently frustrate the designs of the allies.”</P>
<P>James at the same time presented a memorial to the French King,
proposing to make a descent in England also. It is in the earl of Mel∣fort's
hand writing, and intituled,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“A memorial to the King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 90.</NOTE> delivered in December, 1691, or
January, 1692, or about that time.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The French fleet must be ready to sail before the English.—The troops to embark
at Ambleteuse, to land in the Downs or near Dover.—The manner of embark∣ing
them.—Their number.—After landing they are to march to Rochester and
London.—The consequence of taking these towns, will be the conquest of
England and the prosperity of France.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“YOUR Majesty having asked me, some days ago, if any attempt
could be made upon England; I must propose what, at first sight,
may appear rash; but what, maturely considered, may finish the present
war advantageously to France, and re-establish me on my throne.</P>
<P>“What I have to propose depends upon the time in which your Ma∣jesty's
fleet can put to sea. For, if it can only be ready at the same time
<PB N="397" REF="415"/>
with the enemy, it is certain that nothing can be attempted against
England. But on the contrary, if it can be ready before the e∣nemy's
fleet, your Majesty will have a favourable occasion of at∣tacking
them with great probability of success, and I cannot doubt, but
your Majesty may put to sea before the enemy, if you apply from this
time to equip the fleet. On this supposition, I propose;</P>
<P>“That your Majesty, having taken precautions for having the troops
destined for this attempt, near Ambleteuse, and a number of transports
prepared, should make the fleet sail from Brest to join the transports, and
repair together to some convenient place near Ambleteuse, where fishing
vessels may be likewise assembled, in a sufficient number to assist in
transporting the troops. Every thing being ready, the fleet should carry
over the army to the county of Kent, in England, about the Downs or
near Dover; and, having landed them there, should remain in the
Downs or behind the Godwin sands, to hinder the English and Dutch
from joining together, and even the Portsmouth squadron from joining
with that of the Thames. Your Majesty may inform yourself of the
facility of all this, by the sea officers who know the place.”</P>
<P>James having shown how all necessary preparations may be made with
secresy and success, and the transports assembled and troops embarked
with great facility, proceeds to specify their number.</P>
<P>“The number of troops I have proposed, is from 25 to 30,000 men,
comprehending 3,000 horse or dragoons; all my friends having all
along acquainted me, that with that number I shall succeed. But if I
come with a smaller, I shall run a great risque of not being joined by the
English, who, in that case, will wait for the issue before they will hazard
themselves. Whereas, on the contrary, if they see me at the head of such
a good army, they will not hesitate to join me immediately upon my
landing.” He shows that he could easily be furnished with such an army,
considering the number of his own subjects which are in the French ser∣vice;
and that this attempt would be made before the campaign could
be opened in Flanders, where the enemy would be obliged to wait till
forrage was ripe, and where they could not attack France so vigorously,
if he once landed in England.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="416"/>
“What I propose to do, after landing in England, is to march directly
to Rochester, which is but fifteen leagues from the places which I have
named above for landing, and to seize there on the stores of the fleet and
take possession of the ships of war, which will remain in the river, and
of which there will be a greater or smaller number, according as your
Majesty's fleet shall be ready before the enemy; and having Rochester in
my possession, I shall have the wives, children, and houses of a great
number of the officers and sailors of their fleet, which will hinder them
from acting against me with the same vigour, and will render your Ma∣jesty's
fleet more secure in its station.</P>
<P>“From Rochester there are but ten leagues to London; and I know
from experience, the consternation and terror which will reign in that
city, upon the approach of an hostile army. They will surrender them∣selves
by deputation before I come near them, if the prince of Orange
has not an army sufficient to oppose mine, and to keep the city
at the same time; which he cannot have, as he has not left in En∣gland
but 12,000 men, of which 5000 are necessary for the garrisons,
and there is no likelihood, that he will withdraw any of his troops from
Flanders, since he has no idea that a descent in England is possible, as it
has not been made the preceding years.” He likewise infers William's
imaginary security at home, from his having hired 400 transports, not to
carry troops to Flanders, but, as he gave out publickly, to make a des∣cent
in France.</P>
<P>“The nearer I approach to London, the more I shall be master of the
English fleet, because the wives, children, and houses, of the sea officers
and sailors, are in all the little towns round about; and when they know,
that I have in my hands all that is most dear to them, they will not fight
against my interest.</P>
<P>“If I can make myself master of London, (which has never yet
resisted, when it was attacked, even by an army of but 5 or 6000 men),
I do not deceive myself, when I imagine, that the rest of England will
not make a long resistance; since it is certain, that in London, all the
men of quality, all the good houses of the nobility, all the rich mer∣chants
of the kingdom, have so much interest, that I shall have in my
hands very good pledges of their fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="417"/>
“I do not deceive myself by my intelligence from England, though
they are not to be despised, concerning the number or rank of my friends;
and I do not depend much on the troops which are promised me at my
landing, although their number is not small, nor upon the officers and
soldiers of my old army, who would not be employed under the prince
of Orange, of which the number in London amounts to six thousand.
But what I think of importance is, that, throughout all England, there
are ten who would not take oaths of f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>delity to the usurper, to one who
has taken them, and who choose rather to pay the penalties than to take
them; and of whom I can form no other judgment, than that being rich
they do not choose to hazard their estates by corresponding with me. They
mean to show me their number in this manner, which costs them only a
little money, and that they are ready to join me, the first favourable op∣portunity
they can find.”</P>
<P>James labours, in the next place, to show, that this invasion will be of
great benefit to France. That it will dissolve the league of the allies,
who are enabled to carry on the war solely by the money of England, and
the English can never become poor by the continuance of it, while they
are masters of the sea by the assistance of the Dutch, and carry on
a flourishing trade. He then proceeds thus, to give other arguments for
the invasion.</P>
<P>“It is impossible to form a reasonable conjecture of the English na∣tion,
from what the parliament does now, as two thirds of it are com∣posed
of the officers of the court, of the fleet, of the revenue, and of the
army, which augments jealousies and discontents against him (P. O.)
among the people. This is favourable for me.</P>
<P>“It is a thing very remarkable, that a descent in England was never
unsuccessful, when he who made it carried an army with him, and no one
ever had so much justice nor so considerable a party before him in
England, as I have.</P>
<P>“England appears powerful, when carrying on a war abroad under
an usurper, but will appear weak, when attacked by its lawful sovereign
at home. The reason is, that the usurper composes his army of friends,
who are faithful to him; and even all his enemies are obliged to contri∣bute
to his strength against their inclinations, until I go to their assistance.
But if I once show myself, then the number of my friends would appear,
<PB N="400" REF="418"/>
and the disproportion between those who acknowledge the prince of
Orange, and those who are loyal to me; and the moment I set my foot
ashore in England, the prince of Orange would have neither money nor
ammunition, nor any of those things from thence, with which he fur∣nished
his army in Flanders last year; and it would be soon seen, that the
great force which he has now, would instantly vanish, when I had once
cut off the sinews of war, that is to say, deprived him of the money which
supports it.”</P>
<P>The rest of this memorial is addressed to the vanity of Lewis.</P>
<P>Lewis, convinced by the reasonings of James, permitted himself to be
buoyed up with hopes of a successful invasion, and James and his
secretary were employed in concerting the plan. There is a copy of it
among Nairne's manuscripts written by Lord Melfort, with some little
marginal notes in the King's own hand, which are here inserted as they
occur in the original.</P>

<P>James, impatient for a favourable answer to the preceding memorials,
presented another to the King of France, containing an account of the
intelligence he had received from his friends in England. It confirms
the confession of lord Preston, and the truth of the conspiracy, which,
was discovered in the papers found on him and Ashton when they were
seized.</P>

<HEAD>“A memorial delivered to the King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 97.</NOTE> the 27th January, 1692.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Translation. The Original is in Melfort's hand.</HEAD>
<P>“IT is now some time since I gave your Majesty a memorial concern∣ing
a design which might be formed against the prince of Orange
in England. I doubt not but your Majesty has considered it. I am
confirmed in the same sentiments, by several gentlemen sent express from
England to intreat me, in the name of my faithful subjects, not to lose
this opportunity, when the forces of the prince of Orange shall be out
of the kingdom.”</P>
<P>“To convince me, they say that the humours of the English in ge∣neral
are changed; for, instead of treating me injuriously, as they for∣merly
did, every one complains of my fate publickly, except those who
depend immediately upon the usurper; and even of them, a great num∣ber
do not fail to do so in private, when they find any of my friends to
whom they can speak.”</P>
<P>“That, at first, the prince of Orange was beloved. But that now he
is much hated and despised; and that they publickly speak ill of him
every where.”</P>
<P>“That his army is dissatisfied, having been very ill paid; and that
the fleet is still more so, having demanded their pay, in a very mutinous
manner: and that the discontent is still greater, since he refused their
request.”</P>
<P>“That a great part of the army will come to join ME, if I had where∣with
to maintain them as they are in the service of the prince of Orange.
<PB N="409" REF="427"/>
But that, at all events, some will come: that the church of England
and the non-conformists are the two great parties of which the kingdom
of England is composed: that the non-conformists are near the half of
them, and entirely for me; because the prince of Orange has disobliged
them. Although they had a great hand in the revolution, yet, neverthe∣less,
they have not been employed by him since: that they remember it
was I, that gave them liberty of conscience: that I would never consent
to abandon them to the persecutions of the church of England; and
that they will find their interest in my re-establishment.”</P>
<P>“The church of England, which composes the opposite party, forms
more than the half of the nation. But they are divided into those who
have not taken the oaths for the prince of Orange, and those who have
taken them. Those who have not taken them, are entirely in my in∣terest;
and, moderately speaking, form more than three-fourths of the
church of England: for there are some who will have them to be nine∣tenths.
These have sent to offer me money for my urgent necessities in
England; which they declare to be a great proof of their zeal, and of
their hopes that I may be soon re-established.”</P>
<P>“The party which have taken the oaths are again divided into those who
have taken the oaths from motives of affection to the prince of Orange,
and those who have taken them in order to live at peace, and who have
explained them away at the same time. These last will be for me, when
the occasion offers.”</P>
<P>“They say, that if it had not been for the troops which the prince
of Orange has in England, and the militia which are in the hands of his
creatures, they would chase him from England infallibly. But the
troops, which are between six and eight thousand men, joined with
the militia, which, otherwise, is good for nothing, are sufficient to hinder
the King's friends from uniting; and, besides, though they are tired
of their present government, the English are so much at their ease, that
there are but few among them who will risque their fortunes and their
lives, without seeing a body of troops sufficient to give them hopes of
conquering; and then the friends, and even the officers of the prince of
Orange swear, that they will not suffer a civil war in the kingdom, and
they will join me as quickly as they joined the prince of Orange on
his arrival.”</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="428"/>
“They say, that the people are generally dissatisfied, seeing that there
is no end of their misery. For if the war continues, they will be sub∣jected
to heavy taxes; if the peace was made, they will be slaves.”</P>
<P>“That an universal desire of my re-establishment appears among all
good men. They call it universal, because there are but very few who
depend upon the prince of Orange, that do not declare, in public and in
private, that it is their desire. They intreat me not to lose this season;
because there are no hopes of having another like it. For, if the prince
of Orange should obtain any advantage, which God forbid, the English
would be so intimidated, as not to dare to undertake any thing against
him. If, on the contrary, he should receive any considerable check, he
would draw back his troops to England; and then it would be necessary
to conquer by force, which is no easy matter. Whereas, on the con∣trary,
I could now remount my throne, as it were, without striking a
blow, in case your Majesty would send me over such an army as I spe∣cified
in my last memorial.”</P>
<P>“They assure me, that the naval force of the English will not be
near so strong this year as the last: that it will not be at sea before the
month of June: that the vessels will be ill equipped and very rotten:
that the maritime is a corps very much divided in their interests, and
without any union among the officers; and the sailors make frequent re∣flections
upon the difference between their treatment now and in my
time.”</P>
<P>“That all the land army will be in Flanders; and that there will not
remain in England but very few troops, even not sufficient to garrison
the forts; and that there will not be such numbers in Flanders as they
give out: that the English and Dutch begin not to love one another
so well now as formerly; and that the prince of Orange, by preferring
the Dutch, had shagreened the English in such a manner, that they
openly speak ill of him, and some of the most considerable among them
will not serve him any longer.”</P>
<P>“All this is so firmly believed by my friends in England, that they
think it impossible we can be ignorant of it here; and they blame me,
as if it was my fault, that I do not come to their relief.”</P>
<P>“They say, that the earl of Danby boasts, that he has found means of
supporting the prince of Orange, whose prime minister he is; which is, to
<PB N="411" REF="429"/>
send all the troops abroad, to attack your Majesty, and to assist the
allies; judging of the future by the past, that you will not attack them
at home, without obtaining some considerable advantage abroad. This
has put it out of their power to make any resistance at home.”</P>
<P>“Although there is a difference between the accounts which emis∣saries
give me of the number and rank of my friends, &amp;c. yet they all
agree, that if I could land in England with, at least, five and twenty
thousand men, I would become master, without difficulty, in the pre∣sent
conjuncture.”</P>
<P>“As all this depends upon the time which the fleet will be ready to
fail; and as it is of the utmost importance to ME, that I should not be
deceived, and that my friends should not flatter themselves in that re∣spect,
which would be of infinite prejudice to your affairs, and the en∣tire
ruin of mine, I intreat your Majesty to send two or three, who may
inform you of the truth of all that regards the naval preparation; and,
if you find the conjuncture favourable, I doubt not but you will resolve
to finish this war, by a blow the most glorious and advantageous which
can be struck.”</P>
<P>The following letter, in Melfort's hand, has no address. But it
appears to have been sent to some Dutch man in the French interest.
It is intituled on the back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 96.</NOTE> and at the top, in Nairne's hand, <HI>“Lord
Melfort's reflections on the affairs of England, in a letter, dated the</HI> 8<HI>th
February,</HI> 1692.” It shews what arguments Melfort employed, to vin∣dicate
the conduct, and promote the interests of his master.</P>
<P>HE begins with observing, “That James wanted only to govern by
the laws, as interpreted by the ordinary judges; having never taken
any step, without their explicit or implyed consent; and, as he was
obliged, in the private concerns of his conscience, to trust himself to
ecclesiastics, and, in the concerns of his health, to physicians, he had
nothing to do in the concerns of law, but to trust himself to men of the
profession; and they never advised him to any thing, without shewing
to him, at the same time, examples of similar instances in the conduct
of his predecessors, who were sovereigns of his kingdoms: and it is very
evident, that the dispensing power is necessary, as the parliament of
<PB N="412" REF="430"/>
England has not condemned it since the prince of Orange usurped the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE></P>
<P>“His Majesty found his people, in a great measure, languishing un∣der
the yoke of a severe persecution, which tended rather to inflame the
rage of particular ministers, than to unite them, in matters of religion;
and, to remedy this evil, he granted a liberty of conscience to all with∣out
exception; as he wanted that virtue and vice, and not different sen∣timents
of religion, should be the distinctions to determine his favour.
This irritated the church of England against him.</P>
<P>“His Majesty considered the great advantage of which it would be
to the church of England, that the Roman Catholic youth should not
be sent, for their education, to foreign countries, which carried annually
considerable sums abroad; and designed to have a college or class for
those who professed that religion; imagining that that would less alarm
the Protestants, than to mix Roman Catholics with Protestants in each
college, by his own mandate, as he might have done without scruple,
by the laws of the kingdom. His Majesty was so far from intending
to accomplish all this by force, that his design was to have it confirmed
by act of parliament, in order that every one might live in peace.”</P>
<P>Melfort says, he thought it unnecessary to shew the fallacy of the
other charges against his master, as the prince of Orange did not at∣tempt
to prove any of them, though he was obliged to do so by his
declaration; and that, though Charles the Second was guarantee of the
peace of Nimeguen, his brother was not obliged to assume that cha∣racter,
unless he found it was his interest. He endeavours to show,
upon the supposition that James, as successor to his brother, was obliged
to guarantee the peace HE had made, that that prince had done every
thing which his allies could in equity require of him.</P>
<P>“With regard to the States-general, he was so thoroughly persuaded
of their sincerity, that, notwithstanding he was convinced it was reason∣able
to arm, considering the great armament which was preparing in
Holland, yet he would never believe that that armament was intended
against him; because monsieur Van Citters, the ambassador of the States,
swore to him, in the name of the States, that they were determined to
maintain the treaty of alliance inviolable; and that they could not even
<PB N="413" REF="431"/>
think of an action so base,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> as to attack their ally, without the least
reason of complaint. His own innocence, and his good opinion of the
States, hindered him from entering into that salutary alliance, into which
he might have justly entered, with his most Christian Majesty, and for
which he has been so much blamed by the allies; though it is very cer∣tain,
that he is ruined, because he did not conclude it, and trusted so
much to the States-general.”</P>
<P>Melfort observes, that the prince of Orange dared not attempt to
prove the spurious birth of the prince of Wales, though he obliged him∣self,
in his declaration, to do so, “and justly,” says he; “for we were,
to the number of sixty-six or sixty-seven persons, in the Queen's apartment
at her delivery; the greatest part of which were protestants, and even
the nearest to the Queen's person; and they have all testified, upon oath,
what was indeed clear as day-light, that the prince of Wales is the
Queen's son.”</P>
<P>Melfort infers from all this, that it was not the conduct of James and
his Queen, but the ambition of the prince of Orange and of his own
children, which has been the cause of their misfortunes; and that his
conduct toward the States general in particular, was always blameless.</P>
<P>“It is certain, that the King never intended to overturn the govern∣ment
of the States; and, although letters have been counterfeited, of
which some copies were sent to myself from Holland, it is certain, that
his Majesty was always of opinion, that it was as much a heinous treason
in the prince of Orange to usurp any thing over the States, his lawful
sovereigns, as in a subject of England to usurp any thing over his King;
which Balconier, pensionary of Amsterdam, might testify, if he was
alive.” Melfort hopes, from these and several other reasons that the
States will, at length, act prudently. “For it is evident, that the
King will be re established, in spite of men and devils; and it will de∣pend
upon him to revenge the injustices which have been done him.
But ht will be much better pleased to have reason to commend the
friendship and repentance of the States, however late, than to revenge
their persidy in the time past.” Melsort labours, through the remaining
five pages of this letter, to convince his correspondent, that it is the in∣terest
of the States to humble the prince of Orange, and to contribute
to the restoration of his rival.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="432"/>
Lewis XIV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> complied with what James requested, in the several me∣morials
he presented to him. Preparations for the intended invasion of
Britain were carried on with vigour during the winter and spring; and
James, in the mean time, made some further additions to what he had
formerly proposed. There is a copy of these additions among Nairne's
papers, in Melfort's hand, and is intituled by him, on the back,</P>

<P>“AT the same time that I sail for England, it would be necessary to
make some provision for Scotland. For though it will always
follow England, and I have there a party for me much stronger, in pro∣portion,
than that which I have in England, yet it is necessary to encou∣rage
them well, in order to induce them to rise in arms, against a corps
of troops which are already in arms, and the fortified towns which
are in the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>“What I propose is, to send them two frigates, with officers, arms,
amunition, and money to be employed for raising men.</P>
<P>“As to the number of arms, it is certain that the more that can be
sent, the better. But, not to propose any thing difficult, it will be
proper to send them two thousand fusees, six hundred pistols, two hun∣dred
fusees for dragoons, three hundred bridles, saddles, &amp;c. two thou∣sand
two hundred belts, &amp;c. according to the number of susees, and
amunition in proportion, for three months.</P>
<P>“The money to be sent should be two thousand pistoles, at least,
with which they may make a great bustle, and, consequently, a con∣siderable
diversion; and, thereby, acquire reputation to my affairs in
England; where, at first, the affair will be magnified, and pass for ano∣ther
descent; and the more so, that I shall, at the same time, order my
loyal subjects in the low country to take arms, and join their cavalry to
the infantry of the Highlanders, and to come immediately to the ca∣pital
to establish my authority.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="433"/>
“It will be proper to send away these two frigates, the moment that
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet sails from Brest, in order that the news of their arrival may be
known throughout England, before I land.</P>
<P>“The officers whom I intend to send, are major general Buchan,
major general Cannon, colonel earl Dumfermlin, colonel Sir William
Wallace, colonel Sir Alexander M'Lean, brigadier Charles Berkley,
Holmes major of cavalry, and all the officers which are come from Scot∣land,
and all the gentlemen of that kingdom.”</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the persuasions of James, and even the inclina∣tion
of Lewis to comply with them, the French fleet was not ready
early in the spring. James did not leave St. Germains till the twenty∣first
of April; and he was detained, by contrary winds, four weeks upon
the coast of Normandy.</P>
<P>While he remained at that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D N. vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. fol. No. 19.</NOTE> he addressed a letter “to the officers
and seamen on board our fleet, which is at sea, or going to sea, by or∣der
of the usurper, the prince of Orange.” It is dated, at Queneville
in Normandy, the twelfth of May, 1692. There are likewise, among
Mr. Nairne's papers, copies of different. “Projects of a declaration
for La Hogue,” by the earl of Melfort. A short account of one of
them, which is in Nairne's hand, may serve as a specimen of the rest.</P>
<P>James declared he had no design of a conquest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 104.</NOTE> He brought only
such an army as he was desired to bring by all ranks of his subjects,
and which was too small to give jealousy. He was resolved to call a
free parliament, to establish the peace of the nation by its advice, and
a thorough liberty of conscience by its authority. He would protect the
church established by law, and fill up all vacancies with the most deserving
men of its communion. If, after establishing liberty of conscience, the
parliament judged any further laws necessary for the security of the
church, he would consent to them, and never dispense again with any
laws relating to religion. As a proof of the future lenity of his reign,
he offered a full pardon and indemnity to such of his subjects as, after
a certain day, should declare for him, “excepting …… and such
others of our subjects, as our parliament shall think fit to except; by
which we are resolved to be advised in this matter; resolving not to
<PB N="416" REF="434"/>
follow the dictates of our own just resentment, but such measures and
methods of law as they shall advise us, for the weal of our people; re∣serving
always our undoubted right of pardoning even the worst of of∣fenders,
if they shall do what may merit it from us.”</P>
<P>He summoned all his good subjects to take arms and to assist him, by
bringing the prince and princess of Orange, and their abettors, into his
power, or by driving them out of the kingdom. He promised his pro∣tection
to such strangers as declared for him. “But to those who shall
remain obstinate against us, we shall shew the treatment due to invaders of
a lawful King, without declaring war, under the command of one who,
being a subject himself, had no power to declare it.” By no other
means, he affirmed, but by restoring him to his throne, could his people
hope for an end of the miseries which they had drawn on themselves, by
too easily believing the calumnies which were invented by his enemies,
and which they were not able to prove. The legitimacy of his son, the
prince of Wales, could not, he said, be a question. His Queen be∣ing
then with child, and near her time, gave him hopes of another; and
he was always sure of the powerful assistance of his dearest brother and
most generous ally, the most Christian King.</P>
<P>While James was taking all the measures which prudence could sug∣gest
to secure the success of his expedition in the spring of this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE>
he sent Sir John Lytcott to Rome, to obtain some money from the Pope.
Lytcott corresponded with the earl of Melfort, about his journey and
the object of his embassy, from the 21 st of April to the 5th of August,
1692.</P>
<P>He writes concerning his journey from Lyons on the 21st,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 410. No. 2.</NOTE> and from
Antibes on the 26th of April.</P>
<P>He arrived at Rome the 3d of May; and in his letter from thence
on the 6th, he gives an account of his reception from cardinals, am∣bassadors,
&amp;c. He had been introduced to the Pope.</P>
<P>“I Was introduced, the same afternoon, to No. 400 [the Pope], to

[enterprize] seemed reserved to make his time memorable, it could not
be doubted, but he would exert himself, so as to have a considerable
share therein, and that proportionable to his own character, the cause,
and the merits and sufferings of 300 [the King]; all which spoke so loud
and clearly of themselves, that there needed no words to express them,
especially to him, who was so well acquainted and touched with what was
laid before him.</P>
<P>He really shewed his good nature and inclinations, and a great regret,
that he was so exhausted that he could not do what he would. How∣ever,
the issue of all was, that, before I stirred, he promised he would
forthwith 188 [send] 46. 48. 18. 34. 46. 52. 46. 24. 36. 48. 44. 10.
34. 16. 350. [twenty thousand crowns]. 138 [I], with all humility and
earnestness, prest further, that all extraordinary means and efforts might
be made use of, for so extraordinary a cause and end; nor do I think, I
omitted so much as one argument in my instructions, besides what oc∣curred
of my own. But disability was still urged, with allegations, that
every body would be on his back; nay, even 38. 36. 30. 10. 34. 16.
[Poland,] which, without he would 528 [assist], should be forced to make
up with 502 [the Turk]. The truth is, I find, on the whole, he has
been so teized and even threatened, by 514 [the house of Austria, &amp;c.]
that he is in a manner forced to trim, even <HI>contre coeur,</HI> nay so far, that
even the 430 [money] mentioned is, he said, to pass as 432 [subsist∣ence]
for the poor 456's [Catholicks and churchmen]. Further, he
has given a kind of promise, he will still use all efforts, as soon as the
news comes of the 444 [descent].</P>
<P>“This morning, 416 [Howart] was with 400 [the Pope]; and did,
with a very good heart and his usual zeal, press to the utmost, for some
addition for this present extraordinary exigence. But nothing, it seems,
can yet be further done. 414 [Cardinal Forbin] is scandalized at the
little sum, and will speak home too on Thursday next. But every little
must be welcome, till it please God to send more.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="436"/>
“'Tis now past 9 at night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> and just now a messenger brings a note
hither for the 430 [money], which, I reckon, amounts to above 5000
scudi, more than 400 [the Pope] promised me yesterday; and 416
[C. Howart] sends now the said notes under a letter of his own to 302
[the Queen].”</P>
<P>May 20th, 1692. “Since my arrival hither, I have, according to
my duty, given, every post, a full account of my proceedings to 302 [the
Queen], 406 [cardinal D'Esté], and yourself; and, I hope, my next
will be my last from hence. For, in pursuance of my orders, which I
shall critically observe, I only expect the news from 318 [England], and
the final operation it may make on 400 [the Pope]; who, left he might
prove too free, has been plied with astringents, especially since his last
blessing took air; yet cannot he retain the expressing, at least, his in∣ward
affection; nay he has already directed several private devotions for
his incognito intention, though every body knows it as well as they do:
a cardinal with his curtains drawn, and SENZA FIOCCHE.”</P>
<Q>June 10th, 1692.</Q>
<P>“The contrary winds in your parts have also put a great many
to a stand here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> and though at present, every one almost is in a running
dress, their shirt and drawers, yet go they still in their old <HI>piano</HI> pace. But
when I can get once more out of their enchanted circle, I hope to find
my legs again, and make all haste to your lordship; and that, as soon as
possible, after the longed-for news of your having past the Rubicon; for
then there may be some other ground to go upon even here. In the
mean time, there are in this place, who seem to fear, that whatever bles∣sing
is perhaps sprinkled from hence, it may fall on the wrong side of
the channel.”</P>
<P>June 17th, 1692. “God knows where this may find your lord∣ship,
since there have been hopes still above these five weeks here, of
the advice of your being happily landed. But the same winds which
have retarded you, have also put almost every body here to a stand;
nor have I power to stir neither, my orders for returning, with all speed,
being restrained by the clause of “After the news of the landing should
come hither;” according to the circumstances of which, measures may
likely be taken here.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="437"/>
“However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> my lord, after I have done my part, I shall hasten back
again, I hope, as fast as I came.</P>
<P>“No. 400 [the Pope] I am confident, will still do what he can, tho'
with all his power, he cannot always do what he would; no not so
much as lie on t'other side of the river, because it incommodes those
about him.</P>
<P>“No. 356 [the declaration] was here just fitted for the press; but
No. 418 [M. Caprara], after the advances he himself made to get it
finished, alledged, in fine, very unexpected difficulties, urged by those
who were to pass it: so that it is now laid aside. Many here pretend,
at least, great inward zeal in their prayers for 300 [the King]. But, if
they do pray, they indeed do it so as not to be seen of men, either in
their closets, or, perhaps, the primitive grottoes and catacombs.”</P>
<P>June 24th. “I took occasion to shew myself, last week, to 400 [the
Pope]; who, having been prepossessed by 514 426 [house of Austria],
in some points of news to 324's disadvantage, he asked what my let∣ters
said; expressing, at the same time, some diffidence, as to 420 338
[the French]. I answered the best I could; but all by conjecture, hav∣ing,
my lord, not had, I say, the least word of any thing since I came
hither: nor indeed was it well to be expected, since your lordship, I
know, reckoned I had but a very few days to stay.</P>
<P>“Last week, a petition for prayers in the 318 [English college] for
300 [the King] was granted for three days; yet would it not be allowed,
that 300 [the King] should be explicitly named in the Invito; but all
was expressed in the usual general form; nor will I trouble your lord∣ship
now to tell how few of the grandees appeared on this occasion,
whose pitiful politicks and pusillanimity are incredible.”</P>
<P>July 22d. Sir John Lytcott gives an account of an audience of
the Pope;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and writes, that James's disappointment at La Hogue had
cooled the zeal of his friends at Rome, and even of his Holiness him∣self.</P>
<P>July 29th. He sends an account of his audience of leave. He had
pressed the Pope to relieve James and his Catholick subjects. His Ho∣liness
“reiterated his promises, that he would, <HI>In ogne Punto,</HI> do what∣ever
he could. Quickly after, to prevent, perhaps, a further address, he
<PB N="420" REF="438"/>
rang his bell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and called for a little plate, on which was a chaplet, two
gold and two silver medals of his own <HI>impresa,</HI> which he was pleased to
give me out of his own hand, with 200 indulgences, and a gracious
kind of embrace, whilst I did <HI>inginocbiarmi</HI> to receive his last blessing;
after which, and returning humble thanks for all, and leaving him to his
own piety, I retired in form; and truly, whatever comes from him seems
to proceed perfectly from the bottom of a most sincere heart.”</P>
<P>It is uncertain, whether William knew any thing concerning the trea∣sonable
correspondence which was carried on, at this time, between some
on whom he had conferred employments, and the court of St. Germains.
But it is remarkable, that men who were conscious to themselves that they
were engaged in intrigues against him should complain that he dismissed
them from his service. It will, perhaps, give some entertainment to the
reader to compare the following letter and memorial with the journals
of both houses of parliament in the winter of this year.</P>
<P>The letter is in lord Melfort's hand and indorsed in Nairne's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers. D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No 15.</NOTE> “A

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad to find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> by yours of the 9th, that myn of the 1st of August
was come safe to your hands. We are still of the same mynd hear,
as to the purchas of the bayle No. 668 [admiral Edward Charey]; and,
therfore, we doubt not but, as soon as it can be come at, you will let us
kno the terms we can hav it upon; and, because it is so tender ware,
you will take all imaginable care it be gently and carefully handled, that,
if after all it should not answer expectatione, you should not be to blame,
who are the factors. But we know, that you are used to trade, and so
confide on your skill and dexterity.</P>
<P>As for these two bales you mention, No. 251 [lord Godolphin] and
No. 722 [lord Shrewsbery], for all I can yet learn, there is not much
more clearness here, than you hav ther; and, therfore, I can say nothing
of positiv concerning them as yet. I am glad you think we may do
<PB N="421" REF="439"/>
good with the goods No. 31 [English army in Ireland],<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and I find the
Hamborou merchant [a member of the house of commons] will get the
factory to deal in them as desired; and, if it be ready, I will inclose the te∣nor
of it to you, by this post, tho' perhaps it cannot come this way. My
uncle is resolved in that point. I am sory that you should have so smal
hopes of the boxes No. 215 [the fleet], and No. 551 [the parliament of
England], at a time when they would yield us so much profite. We must
endeavour to make the best we can of them; and, tho' they be much
spoil'd. yet if great paynes and care be taken, and right ingredients be
applied, we hope they may yet turn to account; and, therefor, you must
kno, from all the factory, what may be the best way to recover them,
and because what can best do it, you kno, is the product of this place.
I shall send you a sufficient quantity of such as we have, which, if rightly
applyed, may go a great way in the affair. The bale, No. 231 [David
Floyd], shall still be ready to mix with that No. 27 [Samuel Atkins],
when you and the partners shall order it; and I find our partners here
much inclined to mix mor of our best goods on both sides, if they
could be sent without damage. For they think it will be impossible to
adjust the prices and the different shares, without there be some mor
goods mixt, that the good and bad way go together. But the danger is,
by seeking a better market, to lose all, and that we are loath to ventur.</P>
<P>The settlement you mentione was the result of the good inclinations
of our debitor, who thought he could not oblige you mor than by leav∣ing
it entirely to your own honour to draw a model; for this was no
more, it having never been delivered by him. He knew he would see
many of his creditors, before he had use for that settlement; and he was
resolved
to take their advice in it; and, if it had not pleased them, he
would have changed it upon the place, having all things prepared for
that intent, as it appeared to you it was unwarrantable, and there is no∣thing
he aims at more, than to please, in all that is just for him to insert,
and all the matters in dispute are such as he thought he had granted
in the settlement: for such was his intentione. If they have not, it was
his lawyer's fault, not his; and, if you peruse that letter to your part∣ner
better, you may boldly assure all the creditors, it is our debitor's true
sense, to which he will stand, and which he will still be ready to declare,
as often as he shal be required to do it. As for the settlement, it fals
<PB N="422" REF="440"/>
of course, never having been delivered: for you know delivering is as
necessary as signing and sealing is, to make a valid security. All this
rightly used may go far towards settling of mens minds, who aim at
nothing but having their just debts paid; and I must tell you, that,
having particularly informed myself from the book-keeper, he assures
me, that this is our debitor's real intentions; and that he is most as∣sured,
that, if the most rigide of his creditors knew the honesty of his
heart, and the truth of his intentions, as to these points, they would
soon agree to let him come and possess his own estate, till he could bring
in his debts to pay them. There were a great many mistakes, in relation
to particulars, which proceeded on letters from some idle partners there;
but, if any such settlement be again made, there will be no such over-sight,
nor will there, I am confident, be any, or, at least, few particulars,
so much as named. But all will be left to the general meeting of the
creditors, both as to the nature of the payment to be made and debts to
be excepted, and I believe all the creditors will mor willingly submit to
the whole meeting, than to any separate number. However, they must
be consulted there, before it can be determined here, if the creditors
you know have skill. Were they assured of consent, it might engage
them to shew their skill on the boxes No. 215 [the fleet] and No. 551
[the parliament of England]; and, if they shew all they can do, I ques∣tion
not, they might be made marketable goods.</P>
<P>You must not think, that the bale No. 38 [lord Bath] is forgot or
under-rated. Our partner will try and give fairly for it, twice more than
the last merchant bought it at, and better payment, and the last half of
the bale No. 149 [lord Duras] into the bargain, or what he may choose
in lieu thereof of the same value; and, if this is not fair, judge you;
nay, if some more will do, it shall be had one way or other. But this
is a matter so delicate, that you must handle it very prudently, least it
wrong our credit, on the exchange, which is no hard matter, as things
stand. I am affraid we hav not right understood the price demanded,
because it consisted in goods and money, and, it may be, the inventory
of the goods was not right set down: so the best, in my opinion, will be
to give good words and continue the security, till you can send over a
copy of the proposition, after you hav brought the price as low as ever
you can; that is, still offering fair, as an honest man ought, the true
<PB N="423" REF="441"/>
value of the goods No. 573 [Plymouth]. This, you see, is not to ne∣glect
the merchant; but, if you find it better to offer as above, it will
be entirely left to you, and the partners there.</P>
<P>As to what you desire to kno, from France, in relatione to the sea, it
is impossible for us, in this country, to penetrate, they keep their mat∣ters
so secret. But, if there be any appearance of what you hav use to
know, I shall endeavour to giv you timely notice; only lay not out your
money, till I send you word. I am sorry to hear the kingdom is in so
bad a conditione; and I am of opinion, the failing of all our designs this
campaigne, when we have gained a sea-sight easier than ever we can hope
to gain another, by which we were masters of the seas all the summer
long, will make the parliament think the conduct has not been good,
and consequently their money not too well bestowed. Besides, this
brush in Flanders, where, without exaggeratione, we hav utterly lost
10,000 men, and of our best troops the most, will not be an argument
to convince them we ought to trust any more to future promises; and
besides, our losses by sea, our harvest spoil'd, our money transported, our
plantations destroyed by earthquakes and plague, may, I am affraid, put
it in the heads of thinking men, that God is not satisfied with our con∣duct
or cause. These begin to be the discourses in this place; and that
so much the rather, that the people begin here to be affraid for their
priviledges and libertys, since Torgoes, for standing to theirs, has been
blocked up, by the Stadtholder's orders, and forced, by military power,
to submitt to his will; upon which a most violent manifesto is come out,
published by the town; and we kno not yet, but it may breed ill
blood, which nothing but mere force restrains, at this time. We wait
the event.</P>
<P>From France, where you know I have a good correspondent, which
neither of the Kings there could ever discover, I am informed, that the
affair of Dauphiné, so much talked of, is a mere trifle; which, in the
main, does not signify any thing. Ambrun is in the middle of the
hills, and could not be relieved. It is of no strength, and they are go∣ing
to burn it again. There are great heats betwixt the D. of Savoy
and Caprara. The first is for coming farther into France; and the
other, an old cunning soldier, knows it impracticable. For, if he came
out amongst the hills, he would have the French horse before him and
<PB N="424" REF="442"/>
the foot behind him, and the passages stopped; so that he will not con∣sent
to lose the army, for his R. H. hot headedness. His R. H. has
wrote hither to press the descent and action in Flanders: for he sees a
storm gathering, troops marching against him from all quarters; and that
without there were a powerful diversione, he could do no good, nor stay
any longer where he was. This we are not, I am affraid, in a condition
to perform; and that will, in all probability, make the end of the cam∣paigne,
by the duke of Savoy's retreat, as shamefull as the begining has
been on this side.</P>
<P>I must tell you, before I end this long letter, that my unckle is per∣fectly
well satisfied with the true honesty of the father and son you men∣tione;
and, if ever he hav it in his power to do them any kindness,
you may assure them of it from him: for it is his real intentions. As
likewise to Mr. G. [supposed to be lord Godolphin] you mention, of
whose friendship to him he has many proofs, and will repay him his fa∣vours,
to his own content. The box, No. 27 [Samuel Atkins], proves
so good ware, that our partner is perfectly pleased with it, and will hav
mor of it, and keep it still in his shop. I entreat you to make the
right use of this, to shew the owner of it, that he may expect ready pay∣ment
of it for all he has of that commodity, to his satisfactione, and that
he shall have my uncle's, thanks over and abov the price. He has a real
esteem and value for that commodity, as the best in its kind. I think
this is sufficient trouble at once.</P>
<P>The goods, No. 699 [Sir Edward Seymour], have proved stark naught,
for all we know here, and you may judge of them accordingly, if you
find not reasons there to the contrary, and we have but faint hopes of
the bale, No. 656 [lord Rochester]; yet, if you find them of use, you
may endeavour to purchase them, having dill the necessary circumspec∣tione
in so ticklish a bargaine. You know, that I was always of the
opinion, that, so long as you stand at a distance amongst yourselves, you
will not be able to do any very considerable good; and, therefor, it is
the desire of others hear, that you should endeavour as close an union
as can be, betwixt the creditors and debitors, that you may come to a
right understanding, and fall on methods of compounding the differences
so hurtfull to us both; which, having proceeded from mistakes and
falshoods, and having been pursued with malice, I doubt not, but the
<PB N="425" REF="443"/>
animosity, tho' high, will fall, so soon as you can come but to under∣stand
one another; which you never can do, so long as you keep at a
distance.</P>
<P>Before the defeat of the French fleet at La Hogue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> King James had
excepted several persons in his offers of pardon; some indeed were ex∣cepted
at their own desire; but he limited himself in his future conduct
by very general promises, and, of consequence, gave little satisfaction to
such as were not very sanguine for his restoration. This and several
other reasons, which he himself communicated to Lewis XIV. in a me∣morial,
convinced him, at last, that it was improper to send any written
explanations at all of his intentions. But in the mean time, there were
several projects of letters and memorials to be addressed to his subjects
laid before him by the earl of Melfort and others. The first of them is
in Nairne's hand. He names it at the top; “E. Melfort's project of a
letter from his Majesty to the parliament, 2d Nov. 1692.” And it is in∣dorsed
in Melfort's own hand: “Project of a letter from the King to the
Lords and Commons to be assembled at Westminster the 4/1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 101.</NOTE>

<DIV3>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE royal care and paternal affection, I think myself bound to have
for my people, by that character which God Almighty has given
me, transmitted by the long series of their lawful monarchs, my royal
ancestors, has ever made me watchful of all occasions of doing them
good, however ill I have been used, by a considerable part of them;
which ill usage was grievous to me, upon their account as well as my
own; since, from the first moment of their defection, I foresaw the causes
they would have to repent the change of my government, for an usurpa∣tion
which could not be maintained but with an infinite expence of blood
and treasure, besides the other judgments of Almighty God, they had
cause to fear, for the wrongs done to me, his vicegerent.</P>
<P>My circumstances gave time to all my people to make reflections, on
the condition they had brought me and themselves into, to find out the
falseness of the accusations against me, and to consider the hardships they
had drawn upon themselves and their posterity, which had so good an
<PB N="426" REF="444"/>
effect, with many of all ranks and qualities amongst them, that, by their
most earnest prayers and repeated instances of the misery they lay under,
they invited me to come to their relief, which made me lay hold on the
first opportunity Almighty God put into my hands, to endeavour their
relief, with such force, as leaving no ground to fear a conquest, might
yet protect my loyal subjects, and compel my enemies to hear that rea∣son
they had so long oppressed by violence; intending, after the troubles at
home, and fears from abroad, were over, to have sent away all such fo∣reign
troops, as I was obliged to have brought with me, for my defence.
And, as I have always been ready to explain my gracious intentions to
my subjects of all qualities and persuasions, I thought myself more par∣ticularly
obliged to do it upon that important occasion; and, for that
purpose, had an escroll of a declaration ready to consult with my friends,
at my arrival; and, by their consent and advice, and no otherwise, was
resolved to publish that or any other form, more expressive of my royal
and most sincere intentions; for which end, I had a press and all other
things necessary brought alongst with me. For I was resolved to show
plainly my intentions, which, however they were disguised or ill expressed,
in that form, were, and still are,</P>
<P>That, immediately after my restoration, I will call a free parliament,
in which my subjects shall be represented, by such as they shall make
choice of, by their free election.</P>
<P>That, to the parliament so called, I will leave the security of the
church of England established by law, so as that it may not be en∣croached
upon, in its livings, dignities, schools, universities, or whatever
else it is now in possession of.</P>
<P>And that I will recommend to that parliament the case of Diffenters,
and the settlement of liberty of conscience, in so good a way, that men
of all persuasions may be reconciled to the government, and not look
upon it as their enemie, but may all of them think themselves highly
concerned in its preservation, upon the consideration of the good treat∣ment
and protection they get from it, in the full enjoyment of their birth∣rights.</P>
<P>To this parliament, I will recommend the care of the liberty and pro∣perty
of the subject, as well as my own prerogative, which I shall ever
use for the defence of that liberty and property; and it shall not be my
<PB N="427" REF="445"/>
fault, if all things be not so adjusted there, as that I and my people may
have peace and plenty, a good understanding at home, and that share we
ought to have in the affairs of the world abroad.</P>
<P>All who have ever known me, have observed my innate inclination to
mercy, and the pleasure I take to forgive my enemies and all the inju∣ries
done to me, of whatsoever kind they are; so that the many excep∣tions
I suffered to be made in that escroll, were for terror, and to make
my mercy, in forgiving most of the excepted, more conspicuous.</P>
<P>But now, to give the world and you a full proof of my natural incli∣nation,
I declare, that I am ready to forgive all, who shall not oppose
my restoration, excepting some few of the most obnoxious, whom I will
leave to my parliament to name, as my royal and dearest brother did, in
the like case; it being fit that some should fall, as a warning to poste∣rity
of the danger of such unwarrantable practices. After which, I will
give an act of grace and full indemnity to be past in both houses of par∣liament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is, in lord Melfort's hand, a marginal note to a French translation of this let∣ter, in these words: “This article is earnestly desired by most of the King's servants, but I am against any exception.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And, since reward is as necessary to encourage the good, as punish∣ment
is to fright the bad, I was, and am still of the same mind, to be∣stow
my favours on such, as shall be instrumental, either secretly or
openly, in my restoration; and that, according to the quality of the
service they shall render me, whether done by English or strangers, by
sea or by land.</P>
<P>And being restored, I do promise to govern according to law: to have
frequent and free parliaments: to regulate elections to parliament so as
that it shall be highly punishable to make false or undue returns, either
for counties or corporations: that my ministers and counselors shall be
such, as may be entirely trusted by my people; men of integrity and
reputation, capable of the employments I shall give them.</P>
<P>And I shall do all that lies in my power, to make my people happy,
under my just and legal reign; which happiness they cannot hope for, so
long as this unjust usurpation continues, nor from any other form of
illegal government their hearts can imagine; which, if they endeavour
<PB N="428" REF="446"/>
to continue, I foresee, with grief, the sad and dismal consequences their
unjust actions will bring upon themselves; whilst, if they would open
their eyes, they cannot but see the many and great advantages must ne∣cessarily
attend my restoration.</P>
<P>The vast expence of blood, treasure, and reputation, they have been
at, these four last years, is enough to give any reasonable fort of men
warning of what is to come, and to convince them, that all the pro∣mises
of future advantages are as vain as their cause is bad; which,
hitherto, has been supported by falsehoods, as it was founded upon un∣true
and malicious circumstances, among which, none of the least has
been, to asperse me with want of sincerity or good-will to my people.</P>
<P>To obviate which, I now think fit to declare, in the presence of Al∣mighty
God, the searcher of hearts, that what I have here set down is
my true meaning and design, whenever it shall please God to restore me
to my own kingdoms; and that, if any thing be omitted or obscure, I
am ready to explain the same to any, having warrant from any conside∣rable
party of my subjects to desire it. And, if, at present, I knew any
thing my subjects could justly desire, for their further satisfaction and
our joint interest, I would have inserted it. But that being only pos∣sible,
when they are, by their representatives, assembled in parliament,
I promise, that, in the first I call, which shall be as soon as ever it shall
be possible for me, I shall be ready to grant them whatever may tend to
our joint happiness and tranquillity, and which may establish a good
correspondence and legal preservation of the rights of the crown and
the liberty and property of the subject. And I will do whatever may
tend to the advancement of trade and setting up of manufactures, and
what may make the nation happy at home and respected abroad.</P>
<P>I need not tell you the injustice done me. There is not one of you,
how hardened soever in the prosecution of his way, but is convinced of
the illegal and unwarrantable proceedings against me, as well as of the
falseness of the most material grounds they proceeded upon: and though,
by their violence, I have been incapacitate from prosecuting my right
with that vigour and force I inclined, for the relief of my people;
yet Almighty God has, in his justice, taken care to show, by their suffer∣ings,
and particularly of such as had the greatest hand in driving me out
of my dominions, how little he approves of your proceedings. Nor can
<PB N="429" REF="447"/>
the clearest sighted amongst you make any reasonable conjecture, where
these sufferings will end, except you be so wife as, in time, to lay hold
on the gracious offers I make you, and which you might have had, be∣fore
my leaving England, when I was convinced, that I had been misled
by the evil counsel of some now amongst you, to do some things as much
against my own interest, as they were displeasing to my people, had not
the exorbitant ambition of the prince of Orange hindered all the effects
of my royal and gracious intentions, at that time, as is known to many
of you, who well saw, that it was my crown, and not the reformation of
bad counsel that he came for; which is evident by this, as well as many
other demonstrations, that he caresses the authors of these counsels, he so
much cried out against. But he knows, and they have since confessed,
that they were given me for his service and my undoing.</P>
<P>The not embracing the offers I made, before my being driven out of
England, when the prince of Orange refused all treaty, has cost you
dear; and, therefore, I hope you will be better advised, than to neglect
this opportunity, when I offer you security for all your rights, religious
and civil, and to restore you peace, plenty, and prosperity, under the
ancient, legal, and hereditary monarchy, your predecessors and yourselves
lived happily under. I am confident all your fellow-subjects, in the
army and navy, will concur with you, in so good a design; and I shall
always be ready to assist you, to drive out strangers from among you, and
to recover your just legal rights, as well as my own, with a force which
may protect and not fright you; any thing tending towards a conquest
or diminution of the just rights, liberty, and property of the people of
England, being what never entered into my thoughts.</P>
<P>If there be any thing further you would be satisfied in, upon sending
such of your number to me, as you can best trust, I doubt not but I will
give them full satisfaction; and I promise, that they shall come and re∣turn
with all safety.</P>
<P>If you embrace these offers I make to you, and, by you, to all my
people, you see it will depend upon yourselves to be as happy as you
can wish for. But, if you reject what I have so proposed, I do not
doubt but that Almighty God, the avenger of injured princes, will do
justice to me and to my dearest son, the prince of Wales, and it may
<PB N="430" REF="448"/>
be with circumstances of more severity to the obstinate amongst you, by
making the nation in general, and you in particular, account for the in∣nocent
blood of my faithful subjects, lost in the defence of my un∣doubted
rights, and thousands of my subjects slain, in the defence of
rebellion and treason; which blood must needs be heavy on the land,
and on you, till, by a sincere repentance and full restitution of what you
have violently and unjustly taken from me, you appease the Divine Jus∣tice,
and obtain his, as you do the full offers of my, mercy; by which
only you can hope for happiness.</P>
<P>The next letter is likewise in Nairne's hand. It appears that Lewis
XIV. advised James to communicate his intentions in a public letter or
declaration, addressed to his subjects in general; and that he desired the
marquis de Croissy to write one in the most unexceptionable terms. It is
marked on the back in the earl of Melfort's hand, “Proposed by M. de
Croissy, the 23d of November 1692, St. Germains.”</P>

<P>“WHEN we reflect upon our own age, and the condition of our
posterity and kingdoms, we cannot be without earnest desire of
bringing things to the speediest issue. But what we ought to do, in or∣der
to it, has been hitherto very difficult to us to find out. It has been
our misfortune to be mistaken, in our applications to our people, tho'
we can appeal to God for our own sincerity. But, however, we will not
be wanting in those methods we think most likely; and, therefore, we
send this to you, wherein, according to the most natural signification of
the words, we assure you, that we are ready to agree to any laws, that
shall be desired at our hands to secure the protestant religion, as now
established by law in the church of England; and to settle, with the
concurrence of our parliament, a liberty of conscience. And we are
also willing and fully resolved to secure liberty and property, not only
from any male administrations, that may fall in during our reign, but like∣wise
against any invasion may be designed by our posterity; and we shall
take effectual measures for doing of it, in the very first parliament which
can be got together; and we shall, during our reign, delight to meet
<PB N="431" REF="449"/>
our people frequently in parliament, as the best and surest expedient to
beget that mutual confidence, which renders the King truly great and the
subject perfectly happy: so far we are from designing or attempting to
introduce an arbitrary power in the crown. We hope we have expressed
ourselves plainly and we mean honestly; and we are sensible the nation
(besides the violence they have done to their own consciences) have not
found their account in the injury they have done us. We know there
are some, who are rather looking after other projects for redress, than
wishing our restoration. But we also know, that they cannot start any,
that shall be either a better establishment for the future, or can relieve
them in their present circumstances, than calling us home. And, if you
will depute any to come to discourse us more at large, we do not doubt
to give an entire satisfaction to any you commission for that purpose; and
let nothing, that is past, continue any misunderstanding betwixt us, since
we are desirous and ready, on our part, to forget and pardon all the mis∣carriages
of all our subjects, without any exception, and to enter into any
new measures, such as may, according to the best judgment we can
make, close with the united interest of our people; and we wish more of
them would let us know their minds, without the least degree of flattery,
which has had too fatal influences, upon the councils of most Kings.”</P>
<P>There is another copy of this letter, which is likewise in Nairne's hand.
It is marked in lord Melfort's hand on the back, “Project of a letter
to be sent to England; thought more proper than the other, proposed by
the most Christian King, the 23d Nov. 1692, St. Germains.” Nairne
marks it at the top:</P>

<P>WHEN we reflect on the misery we and our people suffer, and the
danger our posteritys are in, it cannot be thought strange, that we
use all expedients, how extraordinary soever, to make our intention
known to our people; being sensible, as we are, that our having been so
much misunderstood hitherto is the great occasion, that we have not been
sooner happy, in the mutual enjoyment of one another. That we may,
therefore, have nothing to reproach ourself with, we send this to assure
<PB N="432" REF="450"/>
you, that, as soon as we are restored, we will call a free parliament, to
which we will leave the settlement of the protestant religion, as it is at
present established by law, in the church of England. That we shall
endeavour in parliament an impartial liberty of conscience; and we are
willing and fully resolved, in our parliament above mentioned, to se∣cure
the liberty and property of our subjects, not only from any present,
but likewise future, encroachments. And we shall, during our reign,
delight to meet our people frequently in parliament, as the best and
surest way to beget that mutual confidence and correspondence, which
renders the King truly great and the subjects perfectly happy; so far
we are from designing or attempting to introduce an arbitrary power in
the crown. We know, that the nation, besides the violence they have
done to their own consciences, have not found their account in the inju∣rys
they have done us; and yet, some of them, rather look after other
more uncertain projects for redress, than wish our restoration. But
we know likewise, that they can never find any that can either be a
better establishment for the future, or a speedier relief from their present
hard circumstances, than the calling us home; and, that no man may be
hindered from so good a work, by the fear of our resenting the wrongs
done us, we further assure you, that we will pardon all our subjects,
without exception, who shall not oppose our restoration. Having thus
shewn our intentions to you, as far as it is possible for us, with the
information we yet have of our people's desires, we shall still be ready
further to explain them to such as you shall send to us for that effect; by
whom we shall be glad to be informed of our people's desires, wishing no∣thing
in this world more earnestly; than to see the happiness of our people
established upon the true and legal foundation.</P>
<P>James, however, declined to send over any written explanation of his
intentions at this time, and gave his reasons to Lewis XIV. in the fol∣lowing
memorial, which contains several interesting particulars, con∣cerning
the state of affairs, and the views and conduct of parties in
England at the time.</P>

<HEAD>“A Memorial.—November, 1692.—After the affair of La Hogue.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">There are two parties among the English Protestants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 102.</NOTE> the church of England
and the Republicans, i. e. according to the late King's notions, the Nonjurors
and the moderate Tories.—The first are not disposed to limit the pero∣gative,
the last desire concessions; but both are against any explicit
declarations at present.—Their reasons.—Among the Republicans, James
mentions the Earl of Middleton, Major Sackfield, and the Earl of Shrewsbury.
—The last lays down his office of secretary of state, at the desire of James.
—A third party demand a declaration, addressed to both houses of par∣liament.
—The advantage and disadvantage of sending one, considered—
The disadvantage is greater.—It was as a previous step for recalling
James, that the Earl of Marlborough moved in parliament, to dismiss all
foreigners from their employments. Some of the party who were igno∣rant
of his intentions, suspected it was to serve the princess of Den∣mark;
and made a discovery to the Earl of Portland.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>I Always imagined, that a more ample explanation of my intentions,
than was contained in the last project of a declaration, was necessary;
but that I must wait for a proper time of sending it.</P>
<P>The two ostensible parties of protestants, who are for me in England,
are the episcopals and the republicans, who are so named, although many
among them are not for a republic. The first have good intentions, but
little power, in the present conjuncture; although, if there was an
opportunity of their taking arms, my enemies would find them formid∣able.
The second are more powerful, having all the employments and
authority of the prince of Orange in their hands. But they are more to
be suspected.</P>
<P>The first absolutely think, that I should not send a declaration, till I
am ready to go over to England; and their opinion is, that I ought not
to make any concession, which may be of any prejudice to the crown.</P>
<P>The second are for concessions. But they oppose, as much as the
first, my sending any explanation or any other paper, until they give me
<PB N="434" REF="452"/>
notice, and have had time to prepare the people to receive it. I have,
accordingly, followed a middle course till now, and sent nothing written
in my own hand. But I have made the earl of Melfort write to both
parties, in terms, which have given a general satisfaction, as appears by
the letters which have been written to him on the subject.</P>
<P>The reasons, which the republican-party have always alledged against
my sending any thing in writing at this time, are, that a great part of the
people being prejudiced by the artifices of the prince of Orange against
whatever I may write, it is not only necessary to wait, until these pre∣judices
are removed by degrees, but that it is likewise necessary they
should be removed, by the means of those very persons, who guide the
opinions of the people. That endeavours were used to accomplish this;
and that notice would be sent to me in proper time. It is very certain,
that this party, being esteemed by my enemies as their deliverers, will
have more credit with them than any other.</P>
<P>Secondly, they say, that if I sent any kind of explanation of my inten∣tions,
before they had time to prepare the people to receive it, it would
induce my enemies to write against it, and to put false constructions on it,
and the generality would believe them rather than me and, therefore,
such a writing would not only have no good effect, but, on the contrary,
would have a very bad one, while I was not in a condition to support it
with a good army, which, undoubtedly, would make it produce a due
effect. That, to dispose the people in my favour, those rich noblemen
and gentlemen, who live at their ease, and are not willing to risque much,
must exert themselves, and contrive, in an indirect manner, the means of
exciting the people, to chace away the prince of Orange, when they show
that they have nothing but the public good in view; and, under that pretext,
they will be followed by the people, and may thereby promote my designs,
with security, and without risquing any thing. Whereas, if the prince of
Orange and his creatures were once alarmed, by a declaration which would
render them vigilant, in discovering my friends, and opposing their designs;
these great men would not choose to risque any thing, for fear of being sus∣pected
by the people as well as by the prince of Orange; and, perhaps,
they would be obliged to favour his designs, in order to conceal their real
<PB N="435" REF="453"/>
inclinations, which would enable the prince of Orange to obtain from the
parliament, whatever he would demand at present.</P>
<P>A third reason they alledge is, that whatever I could say is already
well known to them; that is to say, to the most powerful men among
them. For, as they did not choose to correspond with me, until I had
informed them of my intentions; I have done so, and they have been
perfectly satisfied with them: and, as they are men of quality and mem∣bers
of parliament, who have a great deal of influence, there is no doubt
but they have made them known to others, and that my sentiments at
this time, are sufficiently known to this pretended parliament.</P>
<P>These are the reasons which this republican party have laid before
me, and, for which, they have intreated me not to send any thing in writ∣ing
at this time; and four days ago, the earl of Middleton has urged
the same thing, by a courier, which my friends in England sent on pur∣pose
to me, assuring me at the same time, that great pains were taken with
the parliament, with the fleet, and with the army, and that I should have
news of this very soon.</P>
<P>It should be remarked, that all those who are of this party, have not
been traitors. For the earl of Middleton, who was my secretary of state,
when I came away, never did a false step: major general Sackville never
failed in his duty; and the earl of Shrewsbury, who was secretary of state
to the prince of Orange, laid down his employment, by my orders.
These men are too clear fighted to allow themselves to be duped, and
they have too much interest in my restoration, to allow themselves to be
corrupted.</P>
<P>It was from a regard to this party, and from the weight of their argu∣ments,
that I have been induced to delay to send any paper, until I
should be advised by them, or until I should see, at least, their conduct
in this pretended parliament, from which I might judge of their
sincerity.</P>
<P>Although I mention only the protestants here, the catholicks are
unanimously of the same way of thinking. But as they are less em∣ployed,
their advice has the less weight. But there are, at this time, some
private persons who, I have all the reason in the world to believe, are of so
<PB N="436" REF="454"/>
little consequence, that they dare not declare themselves, for fear their
characters should instantly destroy all their influence. These have pro∣posed
to send such a paper, as the others, who are of the first quality,
have so strongly disapproved of at this conjuncture.</P>
<P>Upon which, the first thing to be considered is, why these unknown
persons have not made their proposal directly to myself, and whether it is
not for fear I should know them for such as they are. Whereas, they
pass themselves for very different persons from what they really are, upon
those who cannot know them so easily as I do.</P>
<P>It is to be considered likewise, whether the opinion of these unknown
persons is to be preferred to the opinions of those other men of quality,
interest, and weight in the kingdom, who have it in their power to act
themselves and to employ others. Whereas, on the contrary, these un∣known
persons, who, for any thing I know, are as much traitors as others
have been, do not pretend to any other power or credit, but that of
presenting the paper, nor to any other merit, but what that design will
procure them. But, setting all this aside, let us consider the good and
the harm which this writing will produce. First, though I should write
it, and place it in the hands of these unknown persons, addressed to the
lords and commons assembled at Westminster, it is certain they would
not receive it. For they would not dare to receive it, when it comes
from me, without the consent of the prince of Orange, which he certainly
will never give, unless he sees that he may derive some notable advantage
from it. So that all I would gain thereby, would be a fresh affront,
which would diminish my reputation among the people, and be a reproach
to my conduct, for having tried an expedient, which I might naturally
imagine to be useless, not to say entirely contrary to my interests.</P>
<P>But, secondly, making the supposition, that what I write would be re∣ceived
and read, all the good I could expect from it is, that, as what it
contains is sufficiently conformed to the desires of a considerable part of
the people, it might in time, and in proportion as the misery of the people
induces them to make reflections, soften their minds, and incline them to
consider, how little they gain by the continuance of the war, and what
advantages they might expect from me. What I write, thus softening
<PB N="437" REF="455"/>
the rough humours of the people, might, by degrees, diminish their
malice against me; and, when they would find a favourable conjuncture,
for taking a side, it might encourage them to choose mine preferably to
that of the prince of Orange, when they would find an equal probability
of safety on my side, as on the side of the prince; that is to say, when
they would see me at the head of an army as strong as his, and not
sooner.</P>
<P>This, I think, is all the good, which what I could write would produce,
even were the conjuncture favourable for sending it, and did all my
friends consent to it, which, after all, is but a slow remedy, when it is
not supported by a force sufficient to induce the people to take a side. I
call it a slow remedy, because it is not to be believed, that the people of
England, hardened as they are, will be influenced miraculously at the
sight of a paper, of which they have already had the substance in so many
others; and that they will change all at once from black to white, be∣fore
they have the fleet or army in their power, or are anywise prepared
for it. The laws which they themselves have made in favour of the
prince of Orange, hinder them from declaring against him, even in par∣liament.
Therefore along with such a paper, a negociation and intrigues
would be necessary; and this is what I call a slow remedy, and what
would be of no avail, in hindering whatever the prince of Orange should
demand from the parliament; on the contrary, it might contribute to
advance his designs.</P>
<P>The disadvantages which such a paper might produce, appear to me to
be of another nature. For they would be great and immediate. First,
it would excite an infinite number of people to write against me, who
would not fail to blacken me, and who would not miss to be believed
now as formerly.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is to be considered, that the humours of the people are
visibly changed: that many among them, tired of the war, and of the
heavy taxes which they are obliged to pay, begin to return to my in∣terests,
and to look out for a remedy to their misfortunes; and, though
I am not, perhaps, more beloved than I was, yet it is certain, that the
prince of Orange becomes daily much more odious, and that a great part
of my subjects begin to be very wearied of him. They, in fact, design
<PB N="438" REF="456"/>
to oppose him strongly in parliament. Some in order to break the
alliance with the confederates, as a thing useless to England, which ex∣hausts
itself for them without pretending to draw any advantage from it.
Others in order to quarrel with the Dutch, being unwilling to have any
thing further to do with them; and all, in general, exclaim against an
army in Flanders, saying, that it exhausts the kingdom, and that a fleet
would be sufficient for their defence; that the money which that army
costs would be spent in the country, and that an infinite number of men
would be saved, of which England stands much in need, being greatly
depopulated by the number of inhabitants who go to the colonies. Thus
my party, covering themselves with the mask of patriotism, will join with
the discontented to diminish the credit of the prince of Orange; and,
if they allow it to go on, will do every thing they can against him. But
if, in the midst of their contestations, a writing under my name is pro∣duced
which discovers the manoeuvres of a third party, immediately all
those who are against me, and against the prince of Orange, would unite
themselves rather to him than to me for the present: his friends would
redouble their zeal: the populace, who are for him, would likewise in∣terfere;
and even my friends would be obliged to appear the most
zealous for him, in order to conceal their real sentiments, and to save
themselves from his vengeance. So that it appears from this consider∣ation,
that such a writing would tend rather to make the parliament
concur with the prince of Orange, than to embroil them together.</P>
<P>It must be considered likewise, that the prince of Orange sees clearly
the designs which will be carried on against him, if the parliament con∣tinues
long. He therefore uses every endeavour to dispatch business
as soon as possible, and to hinder them from speaking of any thing but
the supplies which he asks, until he has secured them; and it is for this
reason, he has, at this time, changed his language. For, instead of con∣tinuing
to say, that France is exhausted, he says now, that his most
Christian Majesty is in a condition to carry every thing before him; and
that the war is at their gates, unless they grant immediate and ample sup∣lies,
for maintaining both the fleet and army. The Dutch gazettes and
the news from England are full of this. For they write, that he stations
his troops along the coasts. That he still sends ships to sea, and circulates
<PB N="439" REF="457"/>
reports in London, that I am ready to go over to England, and all this,
in order to intimidate the people, and to engage them to grant him what
he asks. So that if, in the midst of all this, they saw any thing appear
at this time in my name, which might be interpreted to be a declaration,
it would serve only to be a farther confirmation of the prince of Orange's
argument, and to induce the parliament to grant him money instantly.
For his party in parliament would cry aloud, for the good of the king∣dom,
and the safety of the prince and princess of Orange; and, in that
general ardour for the good of the country, whoever would show the
least coolness, would run a risque of being torn to pieces by the populace;
and in that way the prince of Orange would obtain speedily and plenti∣fully,
what there is great reason to think he will not obtain so soon,
nor so proportionate to his wants, if the maleconents and my friends in
parliament are allowed to do what I expect from them.</P>
<P>Further, the prince of Orange would soon discover, that the alarm given
by that writing was groundless, and he would consider it as an advice
given by France, which he would suppose to be reduced to extremities,
and obliged to have recourse to such an expedient. That would elate
him and the consederates with pride, and make them look upon the most
Christian King, my dearest brother, as if he was not any more in a con∣dition
to support the war, which might produce very disagreeable con∣sequences.</P>
<P>It must be lastly considered, that, when a parliament in England votes
to raise a sum of money, it is properly but a compliment, until the sum
is assigned upon certain funds capable of paying it, insomuch that
scarcely any one opposes this first vote, unless they want to quarrel
openly with the government. But the manner of opposing it and of
securing themselves, when they do so, is by hindering the funds from
being named, or by introducing preferably some other business, which may
embroil the prince and the parliament, as happened last year, when they
consented, by a general vote, to give five millions and a half for continu∣ing
a vigorous war against France. But when they came to name the
funds, they protracted the affair to such length, that the prince of Orange
was not able to make the preparations he intended; and, instead of five
millions and a half, they gave him in reality but three millions, insomuch,
<PB N="438" REF="458"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="439" REF="459"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="440" REF="460"/>
that his debts now amount to nine millions, which appears sufficient
from the promise he makes to the sailors, who will serve this winter on
halt pay, of paying them in the beginning of next summer their arrears
to the month of September last, as a particular favour. This shows, that
the proper time for acting against the prince of Orange in parliament, is
after the first vote is passed. For it is not to be imagined, that I have
yet friends enough to act openly in opposing this first vote, which is al∣ways
passed with eclat, in order to intimidate their enemies who do not
know the consequence, and who believe that the payment of the money
depends upon it, which is far from being the case.</P>
<P>My friends designed last year to recal me by the parliament. The
plan was concerted, and lord Churchill was to propose in parliament, to
drive all strangers out of the council and army, and even out of the king∣dom.
If the prince of Orange had consented to that proposal, they
would have had him in their power. If he had rejected it, he would have
made the parliament declare against him: and, at the same time,
lord Churchill, with the army, was to declare for the parliament; the
fleet was to do the same, and I was to be recalled. They had already
begun to execute this project, and had gained a considerable party, when
some loyal subjects, who were indiscreet, believing that they served me,
and imagining that what my lord Churchill did was not on my account,
but on account of the princess of Denmark, had the imprudence to dis∣cover
the whole to Bentinck, and thereby diverted the blow.</P>
<P>This design is still in agitation, and managed by those who are against
the sending the writing in question. It is therefore to be considered, if
it is proper to interrupt the designs of men of that consequence, who are
capable of doing such great things, and that for a project of unknown
persons, who propose an expedient as dangerous as it is uncertain, and
who promise nothing but to deliver the writing.</P>
<P>Therefore, all things duly considered, I cannot hinder myself from
thinking, that such a writing, sent without the consent of my friends,
might produce very great and immediate disadvantages; and that, even
though it should be sent in the best manner and at a proper conjuncture,
it could not produce, at most, but advantages which are slow and un∣certain.</P>

<HEAD>1693.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693. January</NOTE> at length, perceived that a French army was a more powerful
argument to persuade the English nation, than letters and declarations.
Accordingly, instead of writing to England, he endeavoured to persuade
Lewis XIV. to invade that kingdom, or to convince him, at least, that
it was his own interest to seem to act with such an intention. This ap∣pears
from a memorial in the earl of Melfort's hand, which was intended
to have been presented to the French ministry.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“A Memorial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> in November or December 1692, or in January 1693<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Nairne wrote on the margin: “I believe this was only a project of a memorial
not sent.”</NOTE>”</HEAD>
<P>HE represented, that nothing but contrary winds defeated the design
of the last armament: that, however, as the French King lost con∣siderably
by the burden of his fleet, it was not intended now to propose
any thing, which would expose him to hazard or expence. But that the
fear of an invasion would always embarrass the prince of Orange. In
such circumstances, he would find it difficult to raise money; and though
after the late alarm he had seized several persons who were disaffected to
him, and “a great many men of quality, he did not presume to inflict the
least punishment upon any of them. Such affection had the people for
them, that they would not be evidences against them, although it is cer∣tain,
that more than twenty thousand men had been enlisted by them,
which rendered them highly criminal towards him; and there is reason
to believe, that if the fleet had not fought, while affairs were so cir∣cumstanced,
the prince of Orange, in a little time, would have been
reduced to the last extremity, for want of money; and his government
<PB N="442" REF="462"/>
shaken in England: so little did his friends think themselves in safety,
and so much did the King's interest gain over the minds of the people,
though more from interest than from sentiments of conscience or of duty.”</P>
<P>The remaining part of the memorial was intended to show, that it
was the interest of his most Christian Majesty to begin again the same
game, in appearance, by sending a sufficient number of troops, parti∣cularly
Irish, into winter-quarters on the coast of Normandy: that this
would alarm the people of England, prevent the parliament from grant∣ing
money to the prince of Orange, induce his creditors to urge the
payment of their debts, and oblige him to recal his army from Flanders.</P>
<P>“If the men of rank,” continues the memorial, “who are in the
prince of Orange's interest, and, at the same time, correspond with the
King of England, are sincere in their professions, which, though difficult
to be believed, is, however, very possible, this will give them an op∣portunity
of making their proposals more boldly in parliament, in case
they find they are as much masters of the army and of the fleet as they
expect to be. At any rate, great advantages may be derived from it;
and the secret being well kept, nothing can be lost by it; more especially
as his most Christian Majesty, if he does not send a fleet to sea in the
winter, will have the appearance of troops upon the coast, to repel the
insolence of the English and of the Dutch, who otherwise may have it
in their power to insult and to alarm.”</P>
<P>The late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 107.</NOTE> in a declaration which he intended to send to the fleet,
in the month of February this year, assured them, that if any captain
of a ship, commander, or officer of the fleet, brought over any ship
of war to his service, by repairing with it to any port in France, or by
joining the French fleet, they would have a full pardon for all they did
against his authority, until the day of their return to their duty; and
that, from the moment they arrived, he would give them the same
commissions in his service, which they had in the service of the prince
of Orange, and the same pay from the date of their arrival, or the pay
of the officers, sailors, or soldiers of the French fleet, who had the same
rank, according to their own choice.</P>
<P>“We declare likewise,” says he, “that, when we shall return to Eng∣land,
all the said officers, soldiers, and sailors will return with us, without
<PB N="443" REF="463"/>
any hinderance; and, in order that all our faithful subjects may know,
that we have it in our power to perform what we promise here, we
declare, that all that is promised by us, is with the consent and appro∣bation
of our very dear brother, the most Christian King.”</P>
<P>He concludes, with promising, when he shall be re-established, be∣sides
recompensing them for their services, to pay them their arrears from
the beginning of the war.</P>
<P>The earl of Middleton gave an account of his reception at St. Germains,
upon his arrival there, with proposals from the late King's adherents in
England, in the following letter to a correspondent in London. The
letter is decyphered by colonel Sackville's cypher.</P>
<Q>“Rotterdam [St. Germains], April 19th, 1693.”</Q>
<P>“THough, dear cousin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> I am pressed in time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, vol. vii. 4to. or lord Mid∣dleton's Copy book of Letters, p. 1.</NOTE> yet I cannot forbear
complying with the earnest desire [my own earnest desire] of
78, in assuring 45<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">45 signifies likewise Mr. Brickley in colonel Sackville's cypher.</NOTE> [you], that she has [I have] and will do her
[you] all the service she [I] can, which is, indeed, but common justice;
and that she [I] was overjoyed to find 215 [the King] and 55 [Queen]
fully convinced how kind and useful she [I] had been to them. She [I]
can only tell you, in general, that the indenture is signed, which you may
see at the place you used to go to in a morning, where you have often
met 540 [me, lord Middleton,] to whose letter she [I] must likewise re∣fer.
You will not be surprised to hear, that lies have been already
started at 7 [St. Germains] concerning 78 [Middleton]. But, perhaps,
you may too hear, that from 3 [London] cautions have been given of
her [me], as a 579 [Presbyterian] and 581 [Republican]. Excuse my
not writing to 39 [lord Churchill]. But let her [him] know, that, by
the next, she [he] shall hear from 540 [Middleton]; and that her affairs
are in as good a posture as we could wish. Post-haste. Adieu.”</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="464"/>
The letter to which lord Middleton refers his correspondent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693. April.</NOTE> in the
preceding, is as follows:</P>
<Q>Rotterdam [St. Germains], April 19th, 1693.</Q>
<P>THIS being the first opportunity I have had of giving you an ac∣count
of your affairs, I must tell you, in the first place, that the
only disappointment I have met with is, that Mr. Milles [lord Melfort]
had nothing from you, that could sufficiently enable me to do it as I
would and ought. But I hope the bundle, that is sent by the trusty
carrier you know, will explain the main matter to your satisfaction. It
was necessary to cut out the first part of it here, to show them for what
purpose it was designed. But, if it does not fit exactly, I am fully im∣powered
to tell you, that it may be mended by the tradesmen upon the
place, provided nothing be done to pinch them within or without, which
cannot reasonably be supposed. The alteration must stand as it does,
lest the workmen who are to be employed, should despair of their
wages. As to what concerns Wilson [Middleton], he has reason to be
satisfied, being entertained by the good farmer [King] and his wife [the
Queen], better than he could expect; nor can I omit telling you, that
the bold Briton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The prince of Wales.</NOTE> surprised me with joy, being infinitely above what has
been reported of him.</P>
<P>But what surprised Wilson [Middleton] most, was the lord of the manor
[French King]. He less admires his fortunes, since he was acquainted with
him, and recived civilities from him, which he cannot modestly repeat.
Both he and his trustees [ministers] seemed satisfied with the particulars of
the estate; and are resolved to go on with the purchase, cost what it will;
but cannot determine the time, till it appears whether this season proves
more favourable than the last. The greatest rubin this matter is, the high
value they have for him [King William], who keeps possession; and, by
the glasses they have used, the leech appears to be a leviathan. But
nothing has been omitted to undeceive them. It is not to be doubted,
but the properest means will be used to persuade the tenants of their
interest to induce them thereby to turn to us. It will be necessary,
therefore, that they should be informed of what is designed. But the
precise time is left to the lawyers who are to manage the suit, whose
merits I have represented as I ought; and there are no acknowledgments
<PB N="445" REF="465"/>
they may not expect in particular and punctual performance. In the
main, Mr. Milles [lord Melfort] and Wilson [Middleton] are in perfect
friendship; and, indeed, the first is entirely disposed as you could wish;
and I doubt not but you will do him justice, both here and there. The
only thing that lies heavy upon me, is my concern for the splenetic
widow and poor orphans, whom I am confident you'll cherish, as much
as possible. We are all undone, if you remove. But more of this
hereafter. Adieu. I long to hear of Yaulden. Direct your answer to
John Dorrille.</P>
<P>The late King consented to eight propositions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> which his friends in
Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol.</NOTE> who wanted to restore him on conditions, and were known by
the name of compounders, sent over to him by the earl of Middleton,
who went to France in the beginning of this year. On the 17th of
April, N. S. James published a declaration, which was soon dispersed
over all England; where some of his adherents were seized for making
it public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No 100. and D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 17.</NOTE> It was couched in terms which his friends imagined would
have given general satisfaction; but it seems it gave great offence to the
Irish faction, who were exorbitant in their expectations, and rated
their services too high. King James declared his intention of calling to∣gether
the representatives of the kingdom, and of consenting to the se∣veral
regulations and securities he mentions. “And in that parliament,”
says he, “we will also consent to every thing they shall think necessary
to re-establish the late act of settlement of Ireland, made in the reign of
our dearest brother; and will advise with them, how to recompense such
of that nation as have followed us to the last, and who may suffer by
the said re-establishment, according to the degree of their sufferings
thereby; yet so as the said act of settlement may always remain entire.”</P>
<P>The earl of Mountcashel, who supported bishop Malone and the Irish
faction, against James in France, being offended with this part of the
declaration, received the following answer to a letter which he had written
to the earl of Middleton on the subject.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
St. Germains, <DATE>15th June, 1693.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have thanked your lordship sooner, for the honour you did
me, if I had not waited till I could return you some good news for
yours. The King was pleased to declare, yesterday, that his declaration
had been dispersed, by his order, in England. I suppose none will be
surprised to hear, that the people, of England should have so just a
value for the kingdom of Ireland, as never to be induced to resign the
interest they had in it. The reasons are too many and too obvious to
trouble your lordship with them. I shall only tell you, that the King
promises, in the foresaid declaration, to restore the settlement; but, at
the same time, declares, that he will recompence all those who may suffer
by it, by giving them equivalents. I mean those who have served him;
and not only those here, but all who were included in the capitulation
of Limerick, which will be a better security for them, than what they
have by the acts of the Dublin parliament, considering the many cir∣cumstances.
I do not doubt but your lordship is fully convinced of this
truth; and it will be a great service to the King to convince others of
it, which, I hope, will be no difficult matter. For there is no man of
common sense but will think himself engaged, by interest as well as
duty, to contribute to his Majesty's restoration; which, without the
concurrence of the greatest part of his subjects, is impracticable. This
I have said by the King's command; and I shall only add from myself,
that I haue been, these twenty-three years, most sincerely,</P>

<P>Though James entertained some hopes, from his promises and con∣cessions,
that his restoration would be soon accomplished, with the con∣sent
of his former subjects, he was still desirous of supporting his preten∣sions
with an army; and he endeavoured, in a new memorial, to engage
<PB N="447" REF="467"/>
Lewis XIV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> to assist him in an invasion of England. There are two
copies of this memorial among Mr. Nairne's papers, and one of them
in Nairne's own hand, with additions and corrections in that of the earl
of Melfort.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The advantages of an invasion to Lewis.—Reasons for it.—The number of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>AS all the memorials which have been presented to his most Christian
Majesty, concerning the affairs of the King of Great Britain, have
no other view but the common interests of their Majesties; and as it is
just, that his most Christian Majesty should consider, in the first instance,
his own advantage; this gives more courage to represent, from time to
time, to his most Christian Majesty, with all the humility and submission
imaginable, what is useful for his service, and for the interest of his
Britannic Majesty. All the advantages which his most Christian Majesty
has obtained over the confederates, however great they have been, have
not yet been able to oblige them to ask for peace, or dissolve their alli∣ance.
The prince of Orange is the author of this war, and the chief
of the union of the confederates.</P>
<P>The most effectual means of breaking this alliance is to attack the
prince of Orange, on his weakest side, which is England. The pro∣babilities
of succeeding, in this undertaking, are the little good under∣standing
which subsists between him and the people of England; the
contempt of the English for his person, and their little respect for his
government; the great change which has taken place in the minds of
the people; the great inclination which appears for restoring the King,
and the daily increase of both the one and the other; the great number
of men of quality who engage every day in his Majesty's interests, and
even of men who have influence, and who are employed by the prince
of Orange in the highest offices; the great discontent which prevails in
the fleet and army; the intelligence which the King has in garrisons, in
<PB N="448" REF="468"/>
the army, and also in the fleet; and, above all, the condescension which
his Majesty has had to promise to his people whatever they ask, for the
security of their religion, their fortunes, and their privileges, with which
the subjects, generally speaking, are highly satisfied. These are the ge∣neral
reasons for believing that his Britannic Majesty might succeed, if he
was in England with an army of thirty thousand men, to protect his
friends, and to give the well-affected liberty to declare themselves.</P>
<P>The great utility of this, as well to the most Christian King, as to
his Britannic Majesty, is so incontestible, that it is unnecessary to men∣tion
it. The conjuncture seems favourale for finishing the war, con∣sidering
the great superiority which his most Christian Majesty has over
the maritime forces of the enemy this year. During which, if nothing
is attempted, there is reason to fear, that the next year, the prince of
Orange, by applying himself to operations at sea, may make it more
difficult to transport the troops hereafter, than it appears to be, at pre∣sent.
Besides that, the delay will discourage the King's friends in Eng∣land,
who expect him, and encourage his enemies, who fear him.</P>
<P>The end of summer is more proper for this attempt, than the spring
or autumn. For, in summer, the prince of Orange will be obliged to
abandon England to his counsellors or to leave Flanders. If he does
the first, we have for us the principal counsellors of the princess of
Orange, who governs; and the commanders of the fleet, who will be
encouraged, by his Majesty's approach, and by the absence of the prince
of Orange, to execute more boldly what his Majesty shall demand of
them. If the prince of Orange leaves Flanders, his most Christian Ma∣jesty
may take advantage of this, and drive the confederates before him;
which he cannot do either in spring or in autumn, on account of the
forage and roads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The expence will not be considerable, because the expence of the fleet,
which is the greatest, is already laid out; the magazines are at hand, and
the troops, which are already along on the coast, are sufficient for the
purpose; and would be then unnecessary on the coast. The affair may
be done, with the consent of the English admirals, if they mean to con∣tribute
to the design; and, in spite of the English fleet, if they will not
<PB N="449" REF="469"/>
consent to it. The surest way is to prepare for the worst, notwithstand∣ing
their promises. His Most Christian Majesty is to consider, if it
would not be proper to make the necessary preparations instantly; and,
by making them publickly, without declaring any thing, to leave others
to judge, that he is to send back the King of England to his dominions;
which, when publickly believed, may have very good effects.</P>
<P>First, It would be no sooner published in Holland and in England,
than the expectation, which the people have of a descent in France,
would turn to the prejudice of the prince of Orange, who has hitherto
derived great reputation therefrom, throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>Secondly, It would encourage the faithful subjects of his Britannic
Majesty in England, who have always objected to us, that, if there was
any likelihood of what year and season his Majesty would come, they
would prepare themselves. But, to prepare themselves, without seeing
any appearance of being supported, and to expose themselves thereby to
all the rigour of the laws against them, was not reasonable either for
them or for us. Besides that, many would declare themselves, when
their deliverance is near, who would not do so, when they saw it at a
distance, and that would greatly interrupt the peace of England, which
is already much disturbed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It would encourage the English officers and soldiers, who are
irritated against the prince of Orange, both in Flanders and on board the
fleet, and would encourage the admirals to execute their design.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It would oblige the prince of Orange to pretend either to
believe actually, that the King is to return to England, or not to be∣lieve
it. If his affairs are in such a bad situation as we believe, he will
have a difficulty in seeming to believe a descent in England, because he
will discredit himself, by acknowledging that he had threatened a thing,
which he was not in a condition to perform; and that France, even by
his own confession is in a condition to do what he could only threaten,
and thereby he will give us time to execute the design.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, he pretends to believe the design is real, he must
still abandon either England or Flanders, as has been observed already.
If he sends the English to England, there is reason to believe we shall
have as strong a party there as he will, considering the discontent of
<PB N="450" REF="470"/>
some, and the correspondence which we hold with others, who are well
affected. If he sends strangers to England, he must, in some measure,
evacuate Flanders; and the English will not suffer them in their coun∣try.
In all events, the prince of Orange will be so embarrassed, that it
cannot fail to produce an effect very favourable to us.</P>
<P>What may be objected is, that this would destroy the Kind's friends:
for they would be harassed, imprisoned, &amp;c. But, to this, it is answered,
that it is not credible, that the prince of Orange would do so, if he did
not believe the design was real For that would augment the discontent,
which is already very great; and he will do so still less if he pretends
not to believe the design: for he would thereby give a convincing proof
of the reality of his apprehensions.</P>
<P>If he believes the design, and prepares himself to oppose it, we have
his counsellors to advise him not to provoke so many families of rank;
and, at the worst, he can hurt only friends who are known, and have
taken oaths, and who compose but a small proportion of his Majesty's
party.</P>
<P>The best of all is, that preparations do not oblige his Majesty to pro∣ceed.
For, if the conjuncture is not found favourable, his Majesty may
delay the affair, without any inconveniencies; and, if preparations were
not made, one could not seize the most favourable conjuncture that
could offer. By a favourable conjuncture is understood, some great suc∣cess,
by sea or by land, in Germany or in Flanders, which might furnish
an opportunity of detaching the necessary number of troops: a thing,
which will be publickly known, before the very first preparations can
be made.</P>
<P>It is now the fourteenth of July; and, in a month or five weeks
hence, the preparations may be made; and before that time we shall
know, if the conjuncture is favourable on this side, as well as on the
other, with regard to the armies both by sea and land; and his most
Christian Majesty may avail himself of this, as he shall find convenient.
In the mean time, his Britannic Majesty may concert with all those who
are in correspondence with him, what he shall think fit, and give them
proper directions, engaging neither himself nor his most Christian Ma∣jesty
to promise any thing, left any one should be disappointed in his
expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="471"/>
It is of importance not to allow another parliament to meet. For
there is reason to fear, that it will grant money to the prince of Orange,
though not enough, perhaps, for his exigencies, as happened this year.
He will, however, have enough to continue the war; for he will not
want means of corrupting some; and improving upon the concessions of
his Britannic Majesty, he will cajol others, which may be the means of
continuing the war: and, perhaps, they will grant him a general excise,
with which he will not only be in a condition to continue the war several
years, without burdening the people, but likewise to augment his forces
very considerably by sea and land.</P>
<P>The Smyrna fleet may furnish another favourable conjuncture, and
likewise supply, as is hoped, some transports.</P>
<P>When his most Christian Majesty intends to make a descent, the more
troops he sends, the more will the success of the whole be secured.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the confidence of success with which James spoke to
the King of France in his memorials,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> he was anxious to have proofs to
convince his Most Christian Majesty of the truth of all he advanced
concerning the number and the attachment of his friends in England,
and sent several persons with instructions to negociate his business, and
to procure intelligence in that kingdom. The following papers, con∣cerning
this subject, and the intrigues of the times, are all of the same
date, and in the earl of Melfort's hand. They appear to be the first
draughts of his dispatches, containing the key and the cypher into
which they were to be copied. The first paper is endorsed in Nairne's

<HEAD TYPE="sub">“South's cypher, 16th Oct. 1693.—Bishops.”</HEAD>
<P>“IT is his Majesty's desire, that the bishops and non-swearing clergy
send one or two of their, number, especially one of the bishops, to
him, with all convenient speed, instructed, by the lord archbishop of
Canterbury and the rest of the most considerable of them, to inform
his Majesty of the readiness they were in last year to hav joined him, at
his landing and to hav preached loyalty and due obedience to the people;
and to bring assurances, under the lord archbishop of Canterbury's hand,
that they are in the same disposition still, and will join his Majesty when∣ever
he shall land. For the same end, to encourage the people to come
into their duty; and because that there may be some danger in inserting of
names, ways of writing in white must be found out, and the paper sent
by the boat, and not be brought by any of the persons who are sent.
This is of the last importance, for the King's service; and, therefore,
tho' difficult in appearance, must be complied with; and it's hoped, that
there may be no danger, considering how safe al things come. The
King is sorry he cannot put his own hand to this. The King's affairs

neither signed nor addressed. But from the conclusion, it appears to have
been written by one of King James's adherents to some of the French minis∣ters.
It consists of 26 folio pages; and contains a full state of the affairs
of Europe in general, and a very interesting account of the affairs of Eng∣land
in particular, with the names of James's friends. It is dated at
the top, in Nairne's hand; “In the beginning of the Winter, after the
campaign of Nerwinden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French call the battle of Landen, by that name.</NOTE>, towards the months of October, November,
or December, 1693.”</P>
<P>The writer of this letter, from a general view of the strength and dis∣positions
of the different powers of Europe, concludes, that the war
<PB N="459" REF="479"/>
cannot be finished soon with honour and advantage to France, without
carrying it into England. He then proceeds to consider the people of En∣gland,
as divided into four parties, viz. King James's party, the prince of
Orange's party, the Republicans, and those who were not attached to any
system of government; and infers from a particular view of the number
and sentiments of these parties, that James must succeed now, if he
attempts an invasion. He proceeds in the next place, to mention the
King's friends by name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“THE King of England believes he may hope good success from his
enterprize, because it is incontestible, that he has for him, the earl
of Danby, prime minister to the prince of Orange, lord Godolphin, a
lord of the treasury and a member of the privy council, the earl of
Shrewsbury, who has been his first secretary of state, Russel, who is of
the cabinet council and has been an admiral, Churchill, who is first
lieutenant general, the son of the duke of Beaufort and the son of the duke
of Bolton. All these have served the prince of Orange with zeal, as long
as they believed he could maintain himself in England, and have despised
all fort of correspondence with the King. This shows, that they are
not of the same sentiment at present, and consequently, that his Majesty
has more hopes than ever.</P>
<P>“His Majesty has for him, besides the dukes of Beaufort, Northumber∣land
and Southampton, the Marquisses of Hallifax and Worcester, the
earls of Lindsay, Huntington, Exeter, Salisbury, Peterborough, Chester∣field,
Kingston, Thanet, Scarsdale, Clarendon, Cardigan, Carlisle, Ayls∣bury,
Litchfield, Feversham, Radnor, Yarmouth, Clare, Abingdon and
Derventwater; the viscounts Montague, Weymouth, and Hatton; the
lords Abergaveny, Ferrers, Sturton, Peter, Arundel of Wardour, Gray,
Carrington, Wetherington, Griffin, Farnham, and Huntingtore, and all
the catholicks of England.</P>
<P>“His Majesty has likewise for him, six protestant bishops, and 600
ministers who have not taken the oaths, and almost all the ministers of
the church of England who have taken the oaths; that is to say, as one
of their bishops writes to me, four parts in five are ready to join the
<PB N="460" REF="480"/>
King, or to preach in their churches to stir up the people in his favour;
500 of them having been ready to join him last year, in order
to convince protestants, that their religion was in no danger, and in
order to preach their sentiments to the inhabitants of the country, thro'
which the King should pass.</P>
<P>“His Majesty has the cities of Exeter and of Bristol, two of the largest
in the kingdom, in readiness to declare for him. He is assured of the
garrisons of Hull, Tilbury, and Languard. He has already formed and
armed from 3 to 4000 horse and dragoons, a number or the nobility
and of the richest merchants in London, and the militia of several coun∣tries;
all these are ready to declare themselves, on the first notice.</P>
<P>“Besides, his Majesty has the two admirals, who command the fleet, and
who are in correspondence with him, and from whom his Majesty may
expert every advantage. First, they have been trained by his Majesty
and owe their fortunes to him, and expect more from him than the
prince of Orange will ever give them, and therefore, they have greater
expectations from his Majesty; moreover, they hate the prince of
Orange, on account of the insolence, of which they think he has been
guilty towards the nation; and lastly, they have reason to fear they will
be sacrificed to the parliament, in order to save the prince of Orange, who
will not fail to blame them for the loss of the Smyrna fleet. Delaval
depends entirely upon the King, and Killigrew, the second in command,
depends on the earl of Danby, who is for the King.</P>
<P>“I do not enter into a particular detail of his Majesty's hopes of having
a considerable part of the prince of Orange's army, as the second com∣pany
of the body-guards, the royal regiment of cavalry, a part of the
Queen's regiment, the first regiment of guards, Bath's regiment of In∣fantry,
Selwin's regiment, &amp;c. besides a great number of officers or all
the other corps; when it is to be again considered, that if a desertion is
once begun among the English troops, they will all come over to his Ma∣jesty,
as they all abandoned him.</P>
<P>“The earl of Danby, who is entirely for us, is lord lieutenant of the
county of York, which is the largest county in England. He is governor
also of the town and citadel of Hull, of which, consequently, his Majesty
is master whenever he chooses.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="481"/>
“The earl of Abington is lord lieutenant of the county of Oxford, and
he is entirely for the King, and consequently, the militia of that county
will be either for the King, or of no advantage to the prince of Orange,
and will not hinder the passage of his Majesty's friends, who will choose
to join him. The earl of Lindsay is in the same station, in the county of
Lincoln.</P>
<P>“It is true, there are not convincing proofs of all this; but as his most
Christian Majesty does not think proper to hazard any thing in this affair with∣out
having a greater security, it is necessary, that he should let us know the
state, in which he chooses that England should be, to induce him to make
a descent; and, at the same time, it is necessary to condescend on the
proofs which his Majesty would choose to have to convince him, that
England is in the state in which he would have it, in order that his
Britannick Majesty may urge his friends in England, to put affairs in the
posture required, and to furnish him with the proofs that will be ne∣cessary
for him: for it is impossible to continue the manoeuvres we have
practised in time past, of taking the proper measures in England,
during the winter, for receiving the King in the spring, and not being
then in a condition to take advantage of the conjuncture, to employ the
summer in making preparations for the autumn, and the autumn and
winter for the ensuing spring; at least, unless we know that his most
Christian Majesty will be then in a condition to avail himself of our
preparations; for it is impossible but the prince of Orange will discover
his Majesty's friends at last, and ruin them.”</P>
<P>From hence the writer of the letter infers the necessity of concerting the
plan and fixing the time of the invasion. He shows, at full length, that
the present conjuncture is favourable, and that the design is as much for the
interest of his most Christian Majesty as of the King of England; and,
that the execution of it hath been hitherto prevented, by the artful mis∣representations
of the prince of Orange, who concealed his weakness, and
published such false accounts of his forces, by sea and land, as might
render the success of the enterprize uncertain. He shows likewise, that
England, unless it is invaded, will be able to continue the war.</P>
<P>“Scotland,” he says, “being more oppressed by the prince of Orange,
is more ready to take vigorous resolutions, and is now in the most favour∣able
condition that can be imagined, to rise in arms. More than a
<PB N="462" REF="482"/>
hundred persons of the first quality in the country, have chosen rather
to pay their revenues for a year, and be prisoners to the prince of Orange,
than to take the oaths of allegiance, which he asked. Therefore, far
from furnishing any assistance to the prince of Orange, Scotland would
revolt and make a considerable diversion.”</P>
<P>The writer of the letter mentions several symptoms of a general dis∣content
in Britain, since the loss of the Smyrna fleet and the battle in Flander<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
which he infers from the complaint of the merchants to Queen Mary,
and from the city of London's refusing to advance money to King
William in his greatest necessities. “Moreover, those who have most credit
with him, want now to capitulate with his Majesty, and those who
have a considerable share in the government, have entreated the King to
pardon them; foreseeing, as they say themselves, that his government
cannot last.”</P>
<P>He, in the next place, obviates all the objections, against sending an
army of 30,000 men to England, particularly on account of the quantity
of specie, which would be sent to maintain them, in case the King should
be defeated as soon as he landed. “But,” says he, “if the King has time
to join his friends, there is great reason to hope, that he will have money
to pay his troops; several of the prince of Orange's collectors having
promised him to keep considerable sums, provided they can know ex∣actly,
when his Majesty will come. There is one of those collectors at
Bristol, who, last year, had 100,000<HI>l.</HI> sterling, in ready money to give
the King, if he had gone over from La Hogue; and he kept that money
as long as there were any hopes of his landing. Therefore, although his
Majesty cannot venture to make a descent, without having subsistence
for his army for six weeks after his arrival in England; yet it is to be
hoped, that he may save the money of France and return it in specie
directly.”</P>
<P>The remaining part of the letter concerns the proper place for landing;
and after some further arguments for an immediate invasion, concludes in
these words: “I have now told you, Sir, a part of what I had to say on
the subject, to engage his most Christian Majesty to turn his attention
a little towards England. But it is impossible for me to speak on the
subject, so as to persuade, unless I knew the objections. I therefore,
beseech you to contrive, that we may speak freely and at leisure with the
<PB N="463" REF="483"/>
French ministers, in order that they may debate the affair and tell us
their objections, and that we may be instructed by their knowledge; be∣cause
it is not only our interest, with regard to his Britannick Majesty,
whose re-establishment is our first and principal motive; but also because
all our hopes, our families, our posterity, and, what is still more dear
to us, our reputation, depend upon the success of this affair. There∣fore,
it may be easily believed, that, if we cannot surmount difficulties,
we shall be very well pleased not to engage ourselves in danger.”</P>
<P>The writer of the preceding letter wrote according to the in∣formation
which was sent to James from his friends in England,
as appears from the account given of the opinions of some of them in the
following paper. It is indorsed in the earl of Melfort's hand, “A draught
of the memorials of Sir George Barclay and captain Williamson, 28th
December, 1693, St. Germains.” It appears to be the first rough
draught of a French translation, corrected by Melfort, who probably
intended it for the information of the French ministry. The paper itself
is in Nairne's hand.</P>

<P>“THE earl of Clarendon has commissioned me to tell your Majesty,
that, at any time within three months, your Majesty may make
a descent with success. But that your affairs will suffer by a longer de∣lay,
your friends will be ruined, and it will be difficult to find again such
a favourable conjuncture.</P>
<P>“The earl of Litchfield says, that he answers to your Majesty for the
county of Oxford, as lord Lindsay does for the county of Lincoln, and
that your Majesty may depend upon colonel Brewer's regiment; that
there is no time to be lost, and, that people in general are not willing to
engage themselves in your Majesty's cause, but in the hopes that your
Majesty will come soon.</P>
<P>“The earl of Yarmouth says, that the proper time for your Majesty to
come, is after the departure of the fleet for the Streights and of the troops
<PB N="464" REF="484"/>
for Flanders. He showed me a list of the principal persons of the
county of Norwich, who have promised to declare for your Majesty.
He has likewise secured the city of Norwich for your Majesty; and he
wishes, if it be possible, that your Majesty may have the Mareschal de
Luxembourg to command the army you bring along with you.</P>
<P>Lord Mountgomery affirms, that the most proper time for a descent
is, between this and the month of March; and that, if your Majesty
puts it off to a more distant period, the delay may be of dangerous con∣sequence;
but, that your Majesty coming then, with 30,000 men, cannot
fail of success, the nation in general being well disposed, and if they are
not for, they will not, at least, be against your Majesty.</P>
<P>Colonel Graham says, that your Majesty must infallibly succeed, if you
come any time before the month of March.</P>
<P>Sir John Friend says, that he answers to your Majesty for two regi∣ments
of militia, in the Tower Hamlets, and, that he will join your
Majesty with a regiment of cavalry, and that he does not doubt, but
your Majesty will accomplish the design of your enterprize, if you come
with 30,000 men.</P>
<P>Sir John Fenwick, Sir Forrester, and several other gentlemen, are
unanimously of opinion, that your Majesty may delay your coming too
long, and can never come too soon; and it is their opinions in general,
that it is not proper to come with less than 30,000 men, a good train
of artillery, and some arms for your Majesty's subjects, who will join
you at your landing. Lord Arran believes, that your Majesty never
had such a favourable opportunity as at present, providing you come
with an army of 30,000 men, and he advises to send some troops to
Scotland likewise, if it can be done.</P>
<P>The earl of Breadalbin believes, that the parliament will take the
management of the fleet into their own hand, and that they will render
it very formidable, in order to be in a condition to obtain a favourable
composition for themselves, in case the consederacy should be dissolved.
He is likewise of opinion, that it is proper to send some troops to Scot∣land,
and intreats your Majesty to acquaint him, if you choose that he
should go to Scotland.</P>
<P>Lord Forbes believes, that the present is the most favourable conjunc∣ture
for your Majesty to come.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="485"/>
Ferguson told me, that the English will have this year a very power∣ful
fleet, commanded by men in whom the prince of Orange places con∣sidence;
that they will change their lord lieutenants of counties, and
particularly the lieutenancy of London and the officers of the militia,
and that all the power will be placed in the hands of the presbterians,
who will adhere to the prince of Orange, and, that their intention is to
have this summer, a fleet of sixty English, and forty Dutch ships of the
line; and he intreats your Majesty to beware of those, who advise you
to come with less than 30,000 men. For they are not your friends, nor

<P>“THE earl of Clarendon entreats your Majesty to take the proper pre∣cautions
for making a descent before the Spring, as the prince
of Orange designs to send a powerful fleet to the Streights, and to leave
the channel unguarded all Winter, which will facilitate your Majesty's
passage; and your Majesty may depend upon finding, after you land,
sufficient sustenance for your troops every where in the barns of the
farmers, and your Majesty needs not to doubt, but your subjects will
chearfully return to their duty, provided your Majesty comes with a
force sufficient to protect them: a sufficient force is supposed to be
30,000 men.</P>
<P>The lord Mountgomery beseeches your Majesty not to lose the op∣portunity

may bring along with you, with arms for several of your Majesty's sub∣jects,
who will infallibly join you; and the sooner your Majesty under∣takes
this expedition, the more certain you will be of success; for the
prince of Orange will have a powerful fleet next Spring, and will send it
early to sea.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="486"/>
The earl of Aylesbury intreats your Majesty not to let slip this Winter
season; but to endeavour to prevail with his most Christian Majesty to assist
you with his troops, in order that you may be able to make a descent in
the Spring, at the latest. This expedition will, in all probability, break
the league, which is supported, in a great measure, by the men and the
money of England. Your Majesty's subjects are extremely well disposed,
and will, undoubtedly, return to their duty, providing your Majesty
comes with a sufficient force. Thirty thousand men is all they demand,
with some arms for those who will join your Majesty upon landing; and
the sooner your Majesty comes, when the wind and the season permits you,
the better.</P>
<P>The earl of Yarmouth beseeches your Majesty, to obtain from the most
Christian King, troops for making a descent, before the prince of Orange's
fleet can be ready; which will be very early in the Spring. His opinion
is, that it will be more safe for your Majesty to come after the parlia∣ment
is finished, than when it is sitting, lest the prince of Orange should
oblige them to take some steps, which might be prejudicial to your
Majesty; but, as this is only his private opinion, he submits it to your
Majesty's better judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through he last sentence, in the manuscript.</NOTE>. He wishes your Majesty may land with
30,000 men; the people being so disposed at present, that, with that
number, your Majesty cannot possibly fail to succeed.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran intreats your Majesty not to delay, by any means, to
make a descent later than the Spring. It is his opinion, that your Ma∣jesty
will meet with very little resistance, if you land with 30,000 men;
the English being now so well disposed, that he believes it is impossible
the enterprise can fail.</P>
<P>Sir Theophilus Oglethorp wishes your Majesty may make a descent,
at the latest, in the spring, with 30,000 men, which will be a sufficient
force for vanquishing all your enemies, for protecting your friends, and
for conducting your Majesty, in safety, to Whitehall. That number of
troops will oblige both the fleet and army to return to their duty; the
latter being already well disposed, and wanting only a superior force to
put it in their power to join it.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="487"/>
Sir John Friend desires, with much earnestness, that your Majesty
may make a descent, at farthest, in the spring; your Majesty's faithful
subjects, who have been very active in your service, and who are ready
to join you, the moment you arrive, being in great danger of being
ruined, and of wanting the power of being of further use to your Ma∣jesty,
if you delay to come at this time. As for himself, he engages to
bring to your Majesty a good regiment of cavalry, at your landing; and
he has great influence over the two regiments of the militia, destined for
the defence of the Tower; and he has great hopes, by these means, to
possess himself of the Tower of London; as he does not doubt but the
prince of Orange will withdraw all the veteran troops from London to
oppose your Majesty. He will join to his regiment a company of clergy∣men
of the church of England, who are determined to serve as volun∣teers
in this expedition, as are in fact the majority of the clergy, who
have not taken the oaths, and also many of those who have taken them.
He hopes also, by a stratagem, to seize the prince and princess of Orange,
and to bring them to your Majesty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through the last sentence in the MS.</NOTE> Thirty thousand men is all that
is necessary for this expedition, which will re-establish your Majesty and
your posterity: but, with a small number of troops, your Majesty is
advised not to hazard your person, and the lives and fortunes of your
faithful subjects.</P>
<P>Mr. Louton, likewise, has given me in charge to represent to your
Majesty, not to neglect this conjuncture, which was so little to be ex∣pected,
and is so very favourable, that the like, perhaps, may never
occur again: the coast unguarded, and the people, by your Majesty's
declaration, and by the taxes with which the prince of Orange oppresses
them, disposed to join your Majesty, providing you come to them with
an army of 30,000 men, which will be sufficient to protect them: for,
as this is an enterprize which cannot be attempted twice, they are de∣sirous
to undertake it with safety. With regard to forrage for the troops,
all the barns and garrets in the country are full of it, at this season;
and, if the winter is allowed to pass, it will be impossible to undertake
this enterprize, when there is forrage in the fields; because the English
fleet will put to sea early, and be very strong.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="488"/>
Mr. Stroude desires, that your Majesty may make a descent, and has
given me in charge to assure you, that all the county of Somerset is
ready to receive you: that lord Powlet, he himself, and other gentle∣men
of that county, will infallibly take arms and declare for your Ma∣jesty,
the moment they receive advice of your landing: that your Ma∣jesty's
declaration has disposed the minds of the people of England in
such a manner, that this expedition cannot fail to have a happy issue:
that thirty thousand men will be sufficient to accomplish this great work;
and that, with that number, according to all human appearance, your
Majesty will be successful.</P>
<P>Mr. Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guson wishes, that your Majesty may not let pass the spring,
without making a descent in England; it being impossible that the prince
of Orange can support himself, when your Majesty comes in compe∣tition
with him, the people being already much disgusted with his go∣vernment.
The English would choose to be quit of him; but that will
not be in their power, unless your Majesty comes to deliver them, with
an army of 30,000 men, and with arms for such of your Majesty's sub∣jects
as will come to join you. And when the preparations for this ex∣pedition
are finished, if your Majesty commands him, he will come to
give himself up, in any place in France your Majesty chooses, in order
to be sacrificed, if the enterprize fails; and the sooner it is undertaken,
the more certain will be the success.</P>
<P>Mr. Penn says, that your Majesty has had several occasions, but never
any so favourable as the present; and he hopes, that your Majesty will
be earnest with the most Christian King not to neglect it: that a descent,
with 30,000 men, will not only re-establish your Majesty, but, accord∣ing
to all appearance, break the league: that your Majesty's kingdoms
will be wretched while the confederates are united; for while there is a
fool in England, the prince of Orange will have a pensioned parliament,
who will give him money.</P>
<P>Colonel Graham is of the same opinion with all the other noblemen
and gentlemen above mentioned; as are also all the rest of your Ma∣jesty's
friends, to whom I have spoken; for in the present state of affairs,
it is apparent to all the world, that if your Majesty comes, with 30,000
men, you may go, without difficulty, to any part of your kingdom
<PB N="469" REF="489"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou choose; your Majesty carrying along with you arms for such of your
faithful subjects as will join you at your landing.</P>
<P>Since Sir John Lytcott's return from Rome, James had none to re∣present
him at that court. Cardinal Norfolk and bishop Ellis, without
being invested with a public character, took care of his interest, and
corresponded with his ministers from time to time.</P>
<P>The cardinal's letters are of various dates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 16.</NOTE> from the 23d December,
1692, to the 17th November, 1693.</P>
<P>23d December, 1692. HE writes, that the Pope had already laid out a great
deal of money to charitable purposes. He recom∣mends
ecclesiastics to be employed in the mission.</P>
<P>13th January, 1693. His attempts to get money have been hitherto
unsuccessful. He proposes the preferment of different missionaries, and
complains of the Pope's distresses.</P>
<P>10th March, 1693. “Yesterday I spoke again unto his Holiness, of
his Majesty and poor faithful subjects; but could get only very kind
and compassionate words, renewing his own poor condition, which ren∣ders
him incapable of sending any further succour at present. I de∣manded
likewise his benediction for your lordship and lady and yours,
which he willingly granted; as also some Agnus Dei, which I will get
and keep until I receive your commands how to send them.”</P>
<P>Without a date, but received 16th March, 1693.</P>
<P>“Our good old man faith he is so bare, that he cannot get for the
necessities of the street beggars; but he is endeavouring all he can to
get a peace, at least a truce, among the catholic princes, in either of
which he will chiefly endeavour his Majesty's restoration.” The rest of
this letter regards the nomination of Irish bishops. He recommends
bishop Ellis to be James's agent at Rome.</P>
<P>14th April, 1693. His solicitations for money from his Holiness are
still unsuccessful.</P>
<P>28th April, 1693. “The inclosed is an answer of her Majesty's com∣mands
for the translation of St. Margaret's day, as your lordship will

God and his Saints will look on us and help us, both spiritually and
temporally, whilst we find so little help in this world.” Ecclesiastical
affairs in Ireland.</P>
<P>21st April.—1st, 15th, 26th May. Ecclesiastical affairs. The pre∣ferment
of priests, deans, and bishops in Ireland continued. He ob∣tains
nothing but good wishes for the distressed Catholicks.</P>
<P>30th June, 1693. He writes his opinion of a declaration which James
was to send to Britain about this time. “I have acquainted the good
old man of the appearance and great probability of his Majesty's re∣storation
speedily; and that although he hath hard articles to agree to,
however he will never consent to the breeding of our prince out of the
catholic religion, as was proposed, or do any thing that he thinketh can
be contrary to it; and when he will be restored, he hath firm hopes of
establishing a liberty of conscience.”—“Now that we are in expec∣tation
of his Majesty's speedy restoration, so many will petition for fa∣vours,
that I must also be one of them beforehand, begging of his Ma∣jesty
(and your lordship's favour in it) that here being two brothers,
catholic gentlemen, called Charles and John Draytons, sons to the fa∣mous
poet laureat Drayton in London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“A mistake of the old cardinal's for Dryden.” A Marginal note to this letter in

interim, got a place of <HI>cameriera di honora,</HI> with our old man; and the
other liveth with me. But they always desiring to serve their natural
King, and both their father and they having been always faithful, would
have gone to serve him in France, had it not been to put him to straits,
among so many others, for their maintenance. Wherefore, my humble
request is, that his Majesty will please to make them his gentlemen ushers
daily waiters in ordinary in his presence-chamber, or grooms of his privy∣chamber,
at his return into England; which honour I am confident they
will both as faithfully as decently perform; their father being a convert,
and their mother a catholic sister to the lord Berkshire.”</P>
<P>25th August, 1693. The nomination and preferments of Irish
bishops. “It is better not to stir in these points, till his Majesty be
<PB N="471" REF="491"/>
restored: then we may hope to get as good a concordate made with this
court, as France, Spain, or the Empire hath. If his Majesty desires
to have any deans, I hope to get such as he will please to signify to me,
of his liking, which, in effect, will be the same as of his nomination.
As for abbots, priors, or some other titles, it is thought they may pro∣duce
jealousies and other inconveniencies, not only in Protestants, but
several catholics, who are in possession of these lands, &amp;c.”</P>

<HEAD>The following particulars are in a slip of paper connected with the
above.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Crawford, governor of the fort of Sheerness, promised, some time
ago, to deliver up the fort to his Majesty; and, as he is always
in the same station, although there is some time since any news have
been received from him, yet his Majesty has reason to believe he has not
changed his mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Haman answers for Langard fort.</P>
<P>In the royal regiment of cavalry there are a hundred troopers, who
have acquainted the King, that they have credit enough in the regiment
to be able to answer for bringing over the whole regiment to him; and
that they will cut the throats of such of their comrades or officers
who will make opposition.</P>
<P>Besides the above, there are also the friends whom the King has in the
north of England, who are very numerous; and where there are formed
seven regiments of cavalry and dragoons, for which commissions have
been given, and who will be ready to join his Majesty when he lands.
An account of them is expected by an express, which colonel Parker,
who is commandant of these forces, is to send here immediately. We
expect likewise, by the same occasion, an account of all the counties,
towns, and forts in the North, which are in the King's interest; and of
the disposition of the people of that country.</P>

to pass over into England.”</HEAD>
<P>THE earl of Sunderland writes to his Majesty, that a descent is the
only means to finish the misfortunes of the King and those of the
nation; and that if his Majesty comes now with an army, he cannot fail
to carry his point. He does not enter into particulars, because he
fears that his Majesty does not confide sufficiently in his advice. But
when he is assured that the King is satisfied with h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fidelity, he pro∣mises
to send good intelligence, and to contribute as much as he can to
his Majesty's service.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran assures his majesty of the sincerity of lord Sun∣derland,
and that he may be of great service; and he also advises his
Majesty to go to England, with an army of 30,000 men, with which his
Majesty cannot fail to succeed, providing he comes immediately, to take
advantage of the disposition of the people, of their contempt for the
prince of Orange, and of their discontent, on account of the taxes with
which they are loaded. The circumstances are the most favourable that
can be for facilitating the passage, as well as the landing of his Majesty's
troops; since the fleet sails to the Streights, the greatest part of the troops
go to Flanders, and the money which the parliament gives the prince of
Orange will not be raised in time to put him in a condition to make any
opposition.</P>

<P>YOU are to return our most hearty thanks to all our friends, who sent
you to us, for their zeal and constancy to our service; and especially
for the pains they have taken, in answering our instructions sent by you,
and afterwards, on the 16th of October. And let them know, that
we did not doubt, but that we should draw a benefit from the answers,
suitable to the trouble we gave them, and the danger we made them
incur.</P>
<P>You are to let them know, that it was not only for our own inform∣ation,
that we desired these answers, but at the desire of the most Chris∣tian
King, to inform him of the true state of our kingdoms; that, if
possible, he might lay hold upon the first conjuncture to endeavour our
restoration, if he had found things as we represented them to him, and
as he found them, by such answers as you and others have brought us,
and as our friends have sent to us by other ways.</P>
<P>You are to let them know, that, notwithstanding that, this good
inclination of the most Christian King continues, of which we have all
reason to be satisfied; yet the stopping of so many of the men of war
designed for the Streights, has left London in such a condition to fit out
a squadron of ships, equal to what he can arm, if not superior, besides
what Holland, upon such an alarm as our preparing to land, might fur∣nish,
that it has put it out of the most Christian King's power, at this
time, to attempt any thing so considerable, as the sending thirty thou∣sand
men out of his kingdom, and hazarding so considerable a part of his
navy in the Channel, where he has no port to befriend him, and may be
in danger of meeting a greater force, not only to frustrate his attempt,
but ruin the squadron he shall so employ in it.</P>
<P>You shall let them know, that this delay is a greater disappointment
and affliction to us, and even to the most Christian King himself, than
it can be to them. But that, as they have hazarded themselves for us,
we think it fit to let them know our circumstances, as they are at pre∣sent,
that they may be careful not to lay themselves open to the usurped
<PB N="477" REF="497"/>
government, till a fitter conjuncture happen, of which we doubt not
the most Christian King will readily lay hold.</P>
<P>In the mean rime, you are, by discreet and safe ways, to inform one
of every party, that we desire them to consult with their friends what
may be done for our service there, and propose to us what they would
have us do here; and they shall see, by our readiness to do what shall
be fit for us, and in our power, how earnest we are to come to their de∣livery
and reward their services.</P>
<Q>February 8th.</Q>
<P>You are to inform our friends, that the most Christian King's reasons
for making proposals of peace was not any weakness or inability in
France, but to shew that he was willing to make peace, at a time when
he thought the victories gained by him had let his enemies see he stood
not in need of it; and he has declared, that he will not be obliged to
perform these conditions to such of the confederates as shall not lay hold
of them, before the opening of the campaign. And you have to let
our friends know, that they have no reason to be anxious about them,
since we, who are principally concerned, are upon the place.</P>

of the fleet and of the army.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Nairne's hand.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>HAving considered Mr. Cross's instructions, and your incomparable
letter of the 17th Instant, with what Mr. Cross has besides told us
verbally, we are of opinion, that his Majesty's service and our own duty
require of us to send you our sentiments upon the whole.</P>
<P>We know very well the difficulties of transporting 30,000 men, the
extraordinary number of transports necessary for so large an army, and
that the great expence of this expedition cannot fail to be a little bur∣densome
to his most Christian Majesty, at a conjuncture when he has so
many other affairs on hand; yet when we sent Mr. Cross, we were then
<PB N="478" REF="498"/>
of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> that we could not, with safety to the King, propose a smaller
number of troops.</P>
<P>First, Because we could not then depend altogether so much upon the
good disposition of the nation, as we have reason to do since; for the
greatest number of those who do not act from a pure principle of loyalty,
were not willing to declare themselves, until they believed that the ex∣pedition
was ready to take place; and then they communicated them∣selves
to us: from which we conclude, that the King's party in Eng∣land
is much stronger than we ventured to affirm. Besides, the nation
seems to expect his Majesty with impatience, which is an argument of
their disposition to join him, which could not appear to us, at that time,
to have the force we see it has at present.</P>
<P>Secondly, We could not foresee then, that the prince of Orange
would refuse the popular bill concerning impartial procceedings in par∣liament,
which has created a number of enemies to him, and has aug∣mented
considerably the number of the King's friends.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We could not then judge exactly what number of troops
would remain in England; and, in order that the enterprise might be
the safer, we judged it was proper to propose a greater, rather than a
smaller number; and so the number of troops we then proposed was
greater than we believed to be absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>“But having considered what you write to us in your letter, that
there would be hopes of persuading his most Christian Majesty to hazard
the enterprise, in case we would content ourselves with 20,000 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn in the MS. through the passage in inverted commas.</NOTE>,”
we believe, for the reasons mentioned above, that if the King can come
with 20,000 men, there is, in the present conjuncture, a moral certainty
of success; and, in order to confirm our opinion in this respect, we have
thought it was proper to send you the state of the fleet and of the army.</P>
<P>By the state of the fleet you will see, that we cannot have at sea more
than twenty-five sail of third and fourth rates before the month of
April; and even these ships cannot be compleatly manned. So that, if
France could send thirty ships of war before that time, they would be
masters of the sea, and, according to all appearances, nothing could
hinder them from making a descent.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="499"/>
And, by the state of the army, it appears likewise, that we have not
at present more than 7, 500 men; and when all the troops destined for
Flanders are embarked, there will not remain above 4000 in England.
Consequently there is no opposition to be apprehended, at present, from
the land forces; much less, when those which are to go abroad shall
embark. This confirms our first assertion, that twenty thousand men
will be sufficient; since even a smaller number, according to all ap∣pearances,
cannot fail to succeed, from the manner in which things are
now arranged.</P>
<P>This is what we have thought proper to represent to you, and to in∣treat
you to consider well; hoping that the King our master and his most
Christian Majesty will be pleased to concert new measures together
upon these reports which we send you, and which we certify to be true.
At any rate, we discharge our duty in sending them; and we submit
them entirely to you.</P>
<P>“Although it is not to be imagined that his most Christian Majesty
can change, at present, the plan which he has proposed to himself for
the campaign, yet his Britanick Majesty has thought it necessary to in∣form
him of all the intelligence he receives from England, in order that

<P>Captain Floyd or Lloyd, a groom of the bed-chamber to James, had
carried on the communication between that prince and the earl of Marl∣borough,
and admiral Russel. The first made no doubt of securing the
army; the latter undertook for the fleet. Floyd also carried a letter from
the princess of Denmark to her father, at La Hogue, in the year 1692;
and he afterwards made several journeys to England; and one in par∣ticular
to know from the adherents of James, what proposals he might
make to the French King, upon the faith of their assistance. When
Floyd returned to France, the accounts he gave, on the subject of his
commission, were translated into French by the earl of Melfort, and
communicated to Lewis XIV. on the first of May of the present year.

<OPENER>May it please your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>BEING arrived in London, I sent for major-general Sackville and
the rest to whom I was directed by your Majesty, for facilitating my
access to admiral Russel, the earl of Shrewsbury, the countess of Shrews∣bury,
lord Churchill, and lord Godolphin: and the said Sackville, &amp;c.
having come to me, I gave them an account of the affairs, with which
I was intrusted, and showed them my instructions for consulting with
them about the manner I ought to take in treating with these noblemen.</P>
<P>They informed me, that I was come in the best conjuncture imagin∣able,
because the prince of Orange's party was greatly mortified for the
loss of the Smyrna fleet they lately sustained; whereas formerly they were
greatly elevated, believing, with certainty, that there was no design of
making a descent in England this year, which they had much dreaded, and
being persuaded, that France would seek a peace with earnestness, and
that your Majesty's interest would not be comprehended in it.</P>
<P>The first person they brought me was lord Churchill, to whom I
showed my instructions; at the same time informing him, that your Ma∣jesty,
having heard that he was to have an employment, had commanded
me to assure him from you, that you was highly pleased at this, and
gave him your consent to accept of it, and left him at liberty to em∣ploy
the properest means for obtaining it, having no doubts of his
fidelity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lord Churchill answered me, that it was true, that he had been so∣licited
some time ago to accept of an employment; but that he did not
choose to accept it without your Majesty's consent, which he had de∣manded,
by the means of major-general Sackville, without whom he did
not move a step: that the affair was now passed, but, if it occurred again,
which might well happen, he would not accept, but from a design of
serving your Majesty; for whose re-establishment he was determined to
resign his life, for expiating his crimes, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="503"/>
The next evening, lord Churchill gave me an opportunity of meet∣ing
admiral Russel, who received me with a great deal of friendship. I
informed him of what I had to communicate to him from your Ma∣jesty,
in consequence of the offers he had made to you by myself, as
well as by several others; and, in order to settle the means of executing
them, I acquainted him how gratefully your Majesty would acknowledge
it, if he would apply himself seriously to the business. He answered
me, that he was always firm in his resolution of doing all that depended
upon him for the re-establishment of your Majesty: but that the thing
was very difficult to be accomplished; time was necessary, which yet he
would manage in the best manner he could: but that he would consider
the affair, and, in two or three days, give me another rendezvous. We
parted then, very well satisfied with one another: “I having given him some
light, which he wanted, in certain affairs that interested him greatly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the MS. the pen is drawn through the words within the inverted commas.</NOTE>”</P>
<P>I went to wait on the countess of Shrewsbury, who was sick. I made
her the compliments I was ordered by your Majesty and the Queen. In
return to which she answered me with all the sentiments of duty and
affection for your interests. She afterwards told me, how her son, the
earl of Shrewsbury, had been obliged to accept of an employment; the
prince of Orange having sent for him, to offer him the post of secretary of
state, which he refused, on account of his bad health. But the prince of
Orange showed him, that he had a very different reason, by repeating to
him a discourse which he had held about your Majesty. This surprised
the earl of Shrewsbury much, and convinced him of the danger of re∣fusing
the employment; but, as he expected a descent in England in a
few days, he demanded some time to go to the country, on account of
his health and other pressing business, before he received the seals. The
prince of Orange having granted this, he went to the country, accom∣panied
by his friends, well mounted, with an intention of joining your
Majesty, in case you had come as was expected and wished. But that
having failed, to his great regret, he was obliged, on his return, to ac∣cept
of the seals; which, she told me, from him, he did only in order
to serve your Majesty more effectually hereafter.</P>
<P>Having met admiral Russell for the second time, I urged him much
about the contents of the letter that he had written to me before my
<PB N="482" REF="504"/>
departure, importing that, in ten days, he would explain himself further
to me concerning the time, the manner, and the place. He answered
me, that that was impossible at present, things not being quite prepared
yet; but that he would accomplish the design if it was possible.</P>
<P>I acquainted him, that I should be very sorry to bring back an answer
so general; that one could not form any design upon it; and that it was
necessary to have a plan of what he was able or willing to do. On which
he answered me, that he thought he had said a great deal, since he had
said, that, by God, he would undertake it; that he would endeavour to
gain the officers of the fleet, and would communicate to lord Churchill,
from time to time, the progress he made. But, says he, if you was in
my place, what would you do? I answered him, that there were several
things to be done; viz. to avoid the French fleet, and allow it to pass. To
which he answered, that he would not do that, although it was once his
intentions: and that he would do the business, but swore he would do it
himself alone. I proposed to him, that, since some design would be
attempted infallibly upon the coast of France, this summer, which
would necessarily draw down troops to Brest, or to other places on the
coast, according to the designs upon them, he might send your Majesty
information of this, and give you time to prepare transports this summer;
and that, towards autumn, when it was necessary to disarm the large
ships, and to send convoys to America, &amp;c. he would be a judge of
those which it would be proper to keep in the channel, and accordingly
might retain those which he had gained in the summer, and either send
the rest into the harbours, or employ them as convoys; and being, by
these means, master of those that remained, he might join the French to
transport the troops, which would be necessary for accompanying your
Majesty into England.</P>
<P>He interrupted me several times. But, at last, being unwilling to de∣termine
upon any plan, he protested to me again in general, that he
would undertake the affair, and that lord Shrewsbury and lord Churchill
should be judges of his actions. He gave me repeated assurances of his
resolution, and of his loyalty to your Majesty; and we took leave of one
another, as I saw that I could not draw any thing more positive from
him.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="505"/>
I gave an account of all this to lord Churchill, Sackville, &amp;c. who
were all of opinion, that he had said a great deal, if one could trust him;
and, if one could not, that all he could say would have no more effect.</P>
<P>After this, I waited of lord Godolphin, who explained to me his sen∣timents
towards your Majesty, in the most affectionate manner imaginable.
He acquainted me, that there was too much room to fear a peace would
be concluded, this summer; and that they were sorry to believe, from
the manner in which the prince of Orange spoke of it, that the terms
would be prejudicial to your Majesty, since infallibly the prince would
endeavour thereby to oblige the most Christian King to send your Ma∣jesty
out of his dominions. That he thought it was his duty to acquaint
your Majesty of this. But that it was his opinion, that your Majesty, in
case the peace was not concluded, should come over to England, but
with a considerable force: that it would not be difficult for the French
to make a descent in England, even without Russell, who ought, never∣theless,
to be treated with attention, because, in his opinion, he had said
all that could be expected of him, provided one would be sure, that lord
Shrewsbury, whom he believed to be sincerely in his Majesty's interest,
had an entire influence over him: that Russell would infallibly appear
before Brest; the land-officers believing that the place may be insulted,
although the sea-officers were of a different opinion: that this would give
a just pretext to his most Christian Majesty, to send troops to that place;
and that the necessary number of transports might be prepared this
summer: that the large vessels would return about the middle of au∣tumn:
that the sailors would be dispersed, the convoys sent to the diffe∣rent
places of commerce; and that the English would have a difficulty
in finding thirty vessels of tolerable force: that your Majesty, embracing
the proper time, might come over; and that he believed a blow would
not be struck after you landed, as nine out of ten of the people of Eng∣land
heartily detest the prince of Orange. He reiterated his protesta∣tions,
with the greatest loyalty to your Majesty.</P>
<P>The countess of Shrewsbury informed me, that the prince of Orange
would go to Holland immediately after the prorogation of the parlia∣ment;
that he would leave the government in the hands of the princess;
but that she would entirely follow the advices of Danby and Shrewsbury.</P>

that, in that case, a great part of the prince of Orange's troops
will declare for the King.</P>

they prepare to put to sea this summer, to make a parade, yet the ships

find, that you are recovered of the illness you have lately had. What
I mentioned concerning your brother George, his being to be employed,
was only a rumour, writ in a news-letter; and, as such, I told you of it.
But what you foretold of 322 [lord Murray] was better grounded. I
doubt not, but that he enters, in good earnest, in the Pr. of Or. his
interest. But how long he will continue so, will much depend upon
what he shall think hereafter to be his own interest. But why 253

to find out the reason. What you say may well enough come to pass,
that 303 [Queensbery], 315 [Tarbet], and 324 [Braidalbine], if they
be sensibly disappointed, may turn about towards ME. But I shall fol∣low
your advice, not to reject their offers, which I shall think to be sin∣cere,

<P>When the earl of Marlborough and his wife, by their influence with
the princess of Denmark, were accused of fomenting differences between
the royal sisters, the earl, it now appears, was in correspondence with
the late King. William, probably, though he knew not particulars,
suspected in general the secret intrigues of Marlborough, when he sent
him to the Tower, in the year 1692. James, from a diffidence of his
former favourite, required actions, as the proof of his sincerity. He
had done considerable service to the party, before this period. But the
most capital instance of his thorough repentance was the intelligence of
the design against Brest, transmitted, by him, in the following letter to
James, inclosed in one, from colonel Sackville. Marlborough is sup∣posed
to have had more designs than one, in this part of his conduct.
He wished to serve James with Lewis the Fourteenth, and to ruin gene∣ral
Talmash, as well as to be revenged of William. In King James's
Memoirs, there is the following memorandum, written, upon receipt of
the letter, in his own hand: “May 4th, Lord Churchill informed the
King of the design on Brest.” Page 521. ann. 1694.</P>

that the merchant who owns the goods, 368 [King James] stands in
great need of money, and indeed it is not to be wondered at, considering
his great losses and his numerous family; and would therefore be glad
if any of his friends or old customers would advance him what they can

<P>The meaning of the rest of this letter is not obvious.</P>
<P>From the representations of the late King's adherents, one would be
apt to imagine, that the nation to a man would join him, as soon as he
landed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 123.</NOTE> But an anonymous letter to a friend at Paris, bearing date the
seventeenth of August, 1694, gives a very different account of the state
of things in England.</P>
<P>The writer of this letter, which consists of several folio pages, was
induced, by the different opinions which prevailed, concerning the power
and number of James's friends, to travel round the kingdom, that he
might be able to give a just and satisfactory account to the court of St.
Germains; and he sent it in this letter, as he himself was prevented, by
an indisposition, from going to France. He found, in general, he said,
that, if all who wished James upon the throne were his friends, he had
undoubtedly more friends than foes in England; and that their number
was likely to increase every day, on account of their heavy taxes and
<PB N="489" REF="511"/>
other grievances, and their aversion from the reigning prince. He disco∣vered
this, from remarkable instances of indulgencies shown to the Ja∣cobites,
by the lords lieutenants and justices of the peace, in the several
counties, and from the conversation of the gentlemen over all the king∣dom.
“But, for the common people,” says he, “they are still venom∣ous;
and the magistrates, in most corporation towns round the nation,
no less malignant. They own their present burdens very heavy; yet
prosessed openly, that they would rather carry it on and on, than let
popery, by restoring the King, steal in upon them; and, when asked,
how they can read the King's last declaration, and observe the promises
therein made, and yet doubt either of the establishment or tranquillity
of their own church; they answer, that, being certain some of these
promises will be broke, they find reason to doubt whether any of them
will be kept; and they give for instance that clause, in which his Ma∣jesty
is pleased to say, that, over and above what hath been promised, if
his parliament, when it sits, can find out any expedient, for the better
settlement of the nation and security of their religion, he shall assent
to it.”</P>
<P>After enumerating the several objections, which were made to James's
restoration, on account of his religion, he gives several reasons to show,
that neither the number nor the power of his friends was so considerable,
as he was made to believe; and he instances what he himself had ob∣served.
“About two or three weeks,” he says, “after his Majesty's
declaration was published, being in the country northward, I found all
the King's true friends employed to know who, if occasion were, would
take up arms for him; and in all Lancashire and all Yorkshire, where
I then was, there could be found but very few protestants, that would
contribute to our King's restoration, with any other assistance but that of
their good wishes. Nor could I find in other counties I passed through,
that there was any considerable endeavours made use of to learn either
what would or what could be done. So that, had his Majesty followed
his declaration, as was believed he would, and landed with a small army,
'tis to be feared, he would have found himfelf at a great loss, and upon
a dangerous pin.”</P>
<P>He proceeds to give an account of a conversation he had, upon his
return to London, with “a person of very great quality, and a protestant.
<PB N="490" REF="512"/>
I told him,” he continues, “our King was informed many thousand of
his protestant subjects were in arms, and ready upon his landing to join
him. His reply was, that he did both believe and hope our King would
not trust to such stories; that Roman Catholics were apprehended to cal∣culate
wrong, as to the number of his Majesty's true friends; believing,
hands, when time serves, will be as forward to fight for him, as tongues
are to wish him back.”</P>
<P>This was confirmed to him, by “another person of note, a lieutenant
colonel of horse, under our King at Salisbury.” This person “was
very frequently with the chiefs, and most part of those protestants, who
had promised to hazard both their lives and fortunes for the King, when
he was at La Hogue;” and he found that nothing was ever determined
upon, at all their meetings, though he had often proposed to them, to
determine, “whether, when the king landed, they should attempt to
break through the enemy and join him, or stay till he had engaged
them on the one side, and then fall on the other. But he protested to
me, that, though they met daily, nothing was agreed on, even to that
very day news were brought, that the French at sea were defeat and
their ships burnt.”</P>
<P>“I took,” says he, “the confidence to ask him (the man of quality)
yet further, if those, who put him upon his last declaration and engaged
him in such large promises, did not assure our King, that he should be
restored to his crown, without any hazard of his person? To which, an∣swer
was given, that our King is not the first confiding and sincere
prince, that hath been wrong biassed, by a designing people; who now,
by virtue of his declaration, being sure, whenever he comes (for so it
speaks), both of their pardon and their privileges, provided only that
they fight not against him, who can rationally believe, that they will un∣necessarily
hazard both their lives and fortunes, by fighting for him?”
His opinion, therefore, was, that James should come over with a
powerful army; and, immediately, upon his landing, “issue a new me∣nacing
declaration. For they must be taught to live and fear, before
they will learn to do their duty.”</P>
<P>He told his friend, that it was believed, that those who framed the
declaration in England and sent it over to St. Germains, had assured the
<PB N="491" REF="513"/>
King, that they would free him from his promises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> by authority of par∣liament.
His friend answered in the negative, and adduced several
reasons to convince him, that the Roman Catholics behaved imprudently,
and that there was no room to expect the hearty concurrence of the pro∣testants,
in replacing James on the throne.</P>

given intelligence of the designs and out-going of the fleet, and the in∣tercepting
of the merchant-men, will do so no more.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The King's answer.</HEAD>
<P>In the first place, you are to assure those you come from, and all the
King's friends in general, that his Majesty is very sensible, both of their
actings and sufferings for him, and hopes they will continue, when the
occasion deserves it, to give him their advice and informations, whereby
to regulate his own proceedings here.</P>
<P>His Majesty has no reason to mistrust the friendship and frequent pro∣mises
of the most Christian King to restore him, whenever he is able;
and, since it is both his interest as well as for his honour to do it, it can∣not
be thought that he will let slip any opportunity, which he thinks a
good one to do it.</P>
<P>2. Whereas there was a bill brought in the last session of parliament
of the oath of abjuration, they are in a more easy way to oblige the ge∣nerality
to join in the war with them against France, which is an oath of
fidelity to the present government, without taking notice of your Majesty
<PB N="492" REF="514"/>
or the prince or princess of Orange's usurped titles. It is not doubted,
but they will go a great length.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>It is to be supposed the prince of Orange will not consent to an oath,
that seems to establish a common-wealth; and it is to be hoped, that no∣body
can be surprised with a new one, that seemed to scruple the old.</P>
<P>3. In the last session of parliament, there was a bill brought in for
a general excise, but could not pass. It is not doubted but it will in
the next; that, with the general revenue of the crown, will amount, at
least, to six million, and will certainly be paid to carry on the war against
France.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>The King expects, that his friends will use all their endeavours to op∣pose
a general excise; and, if it cannot be prevented, to make it as
onorous and clamorous, and for as short a time, as may be.</P>
<P>4. They are daily alarmed, with a general peace, and that your Ma∣jesty
is to be excluded; which does startle most of your Majesty's loyal
subjects to that degree, that a great many of them are designing to
leave the kingdom, and some of the better sort has already sent to Ham∣burgh
to know the constitution of that place. If there be not some speedy
course taken to prevent this, it will be of ill consequence to your
Majesty's service.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King has no apprehensions of a general peace to his preju∣dice;
and that he has reason to believe there is no treaty in agitation at
this time. So that the prince of Orange's brags are no more to be be∣lieved,
upon this, than his promises upon other matters.</P>
<P>5. They desire, that your Majesty may commission some of these that
you think most proper for the management of your affairs; and that they
may not be left to the indiscretion of the generality of pretenders.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King approves of their advice, and that he will give direc∣tions
accordingly, with which they shall be speedily advertised.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="515"/>
6. If your Majesty thinks fit, they desire to know whether you have
any confidence in any of the court-party. Some of them has been heard
say as much, though others dare not trust them, without your Majesty's
orders, with which they are ready to comply, and to join with them, or
any others for your Majesty's service.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King thinks it extreamly for his service, that they should
endeavour to gain people to his interest, especially, such as are employed
by the prince of Orange, as far as they can do it with their own safety;
and they can best judge whom they can treat with in such nice matters.</P>
<P>7. They desire, that your Majesty's instructions may be more early
sent this session of parliament than they were the last.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>That besides what is herein contained, and what has been formerly said
upon that occasion, the King does not fee, that there is any more direc∣tions
to be given: but in case they, upon the place, have any thing to
offer, they shall know the King's mind immediately thereupon; and than,
upon the whole, he remits this and all other things to their prudent ma∣nagement.</P>
<P>8. They earnestly beg, that your Majesty may think on some way how
to reconcile the church party and these of the dissenters, that are in par∣liament.
It would contribute much to your Majesty's service.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>If they cannot prevail to reconcile these parties in parliament as to
their own divisions, the King recommends, both to them and you, that
endeavours may be used to reconcile them to him and to the cause in
general.</P>
<P>9. They beg, that your Majesty would be pleased to admit of the
chancellor of England into your councils. Your enemies take advan∣tage
of his not being in it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>The King will be, on all occasions, ready to express the just value
and esteem he has for his lord chancellor.</P>
<P>10. They beg, that your Majesty may return me, or whom your Ma∣jesty
thinks more fit, with instructions what your Majesty will have
<PB N="494" REF="516"/>
them do; for, at present, they are at a stand, and do not know what
to do.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>This article is answered already by the former.</P>
<P>11. They desire, that your Majesty may adhere to your last declaration.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer,</HEAD>
<P>The King has never given any reason to believe that he will infringe
his declaration, and he is resolved not to do it.</P>
<P>12. They desire, that, if your Majesty thinks fit to call any of the
bishops, that it may be the bishop of Ely. They think it would be for
your service, and he is in a condition to live without being burthensome
to your Majesty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>The King approves of their opinion, and when he calls any it shall
be him.</P>
<P>13. They desire, that your Majesty would acquaint the King of France
with the condition of colonel Parker and Crosbey. They are afraid it
will go hard with them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>The King of France has been informed of Parker and Crosbey's con∣dition;
but his appearing for them would do them prejudice.</P>
<P>14. They desire, that what orders or instructions they are to receive
may be from your Majesty, or from your secretaries only, and not from
particular persons, who pretend to have private instructions from your
Majesty; and what they send shall be directly to yourself and to your
secretaries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King approves of their advice, and has given particular di∣rections
about it, according to their opinion, and that you are not for the
future to give any credit to any person, who shall presume to act to the
contrary.”</P>
<P>There were two parties in James's cabinet, the compounders and the
non-compounders. Middleton was at the head of the first, and Melfort
of the last. The compounders advised him to offer a general pardon, in
<PB N="495" REF="517"/>
his declarations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and proposed to bring him back only upon certain
conditions: the non-compounders were willing to receive him, without
any restrictions, and to except several persons in his offers of pardon.
These probably were James's favourites. But, to please the other party,
Melsort was dismissed, as if under some disgrace, and ordered to with∣draw
from court; and Mr. Caryll was made secretary of state, in his
room. Caryll, in a letter to his predecessor, demands the very copies of
memorials, which are now extant, among Mr. Nairne's papers.</P>

<P>I Dined this day with Monsieur de Pontchartrain. It will not be necessary
to repeat the dialogue, since you will easily guess my part of the dis∣course
by his, which was, in short, that though the memorial was short,
yet it was full and clear; that all that he could say of it was what he had
told the King, my master; that, when the King thought fit to under∣take
it, nothing should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anting that depended on him; that for the
detail, he desired to be excused from entering into it, because it belong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to Monsieur de Croissy, with whom he would not interfere. I went im∣mediately
from him to Monsieur de Croissy, who, after a long preamble
of his respect for the King, our master, and his earnest wishes of what
was proposed, started several difficultys of a year old, as want of money,
the difficulty of the transportation, the want of a place of security, and the
danger of their being beaten. To which I returned not only the old
answers, but such new ones as the present conjuncture afforded, which
will not be necessary to repeat, since I have always acquainted the King,
our master, with what I thought might be said on such an occasion. He
told me he would represent what I said to the King. I could perceive,
that what he objected was not so much from himself, as what he supposed
might be by others, which are indeed so very weak, that I cannot but
entertain good hopes, notwithstanding Monsieur de Pontchartrain's dry
answer. For it cannot be supposed, that they will undertake any thing,
till they have seen the disposition of the enemy's forces both by land and
<PB N="498" REF="520"/>
sea; and, when they do, they perhaps will keep the secret from us as
long as they can; nor ought we to wonder at it, after the alarm that
was given last spring. I can find by the courtiers, that Monsieur de
Pontchartrain is the only man, at this time, that has any interest with his
matter. For my own part, I should be very glad to be confined to
Constantinople, on condition the lord Melfort could carry our master
home. But it is very probable, that Monsieur de Phillippeaux does not
differ in opinion with his father. This court goes into mourning to∣morrow;

<P>“THE King and his ministers have approved of your memorial.
Monsieur de Pontchartrain did not choose to enter into parti∣culars,
and referred me to Monsieur de Croissy. Monsieur de Croissy
started the same difficulties he started last year. I am not, therefore,
able to see clearly through this affair. I sent compliments to Monsieur
de la Touche, who answered me immediately, that he would come to see
me the next morning. But he sent then an excuse, without fixing any
other time; and, as there are five days since, I have no hopes of seeing
him, and I don't believe that I ought to press him farther, as there may be
some mystery in the case.</P>
<P>“It is from your care and prudence, that I expect the success of our
affairs.”</P>
<P>He writes to him in the same desponding strain, on the sixth of
October. “I have received,” says he, “your letter of the fourth, and,
thank God, I am naturally inclined to follow the course you approve of,
<PB N="499" REF="521"/>
which is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> not to importune any one. Our affair is always in the same
situation. It is no longer spoken of; and I imagine, they want to see the
disposition of the enemy's forces by sea and land, before they come to
any resolution. It is so apparent, that Monsieur de la Touche pur∣posely
avoids me, that I think, I should not press him any more. I
will not despair, while we allow ourselves to be guided by you.”</P>

<P>IN the first place, you must assure all our friends, that have been
concerned with you in our service, that we have a just sense of their
loyalty, and of the pains they have taken, and the hazards they have un∣dergone
in our behalf, of which we shall be very mindful, whenever it
shall please God to put us in a condition of shewing our good intentions
towards them.</P>
<P>Secondly, you are to desire them, in our name, to keep themselves
in a readiness to serve us, whenever a good occasion offers itself; and
that, in the mean time, they should be cautious to preserve themselves,
as well as they can, and not to stir, till they have particular directions
from us; which they shall not fail of, in the proper season, when they
may do us effectual service, without needlessly exposing themselves.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they must not expect, that we can name the time when this
will be, since it depends upon so many future contingents and not upon
our will; but that of our dearest brother, the most Christian King, who,
however well inclined he may be towards us, whereof we have all the
reason in the world to be thoroughly satisfied, must, notwithstanding,
wait for the means and opportunities of executing what we all desire.
Wherefore, our friends must consider, that, although they suffer very
much by delay, yet none can be greater sufferers thereby, than we our∣selves.
So that they may rest satisfied, we shall neglect no opportunity
of bringing to pass, what is our common concern.</P>

the inclosed paper of instructions, as also the four sealed notes, numbered

No. 3, for auditor Aldworth, No. 4, for Sir John Friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Piggot having informed, with some assurance, Mr. Harrison,
[K. James], that Mr. Tyson was both able and willing, by the assistance
of his friends, to advance a sum of money, for the use of Mr. Harrison
[K. James], of which, at present, he stands in great need; these are, in
Mr. Harrison's [K. James's] name, to assure him, that such a service,
at this time, would be very acceptable to him; of which matter, Har∣rison
[K. James] desires to be further informed from Tyson himself.</P>
<P>It having been represented from many hands, and particularly by
Piggot, that Mr. Perret, the lawyer, has been very zealous and useful in

who will not be unmindful of him, when it shall be in his power to

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>Dec. 30th, 1694.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IF I have not the honour of writing to you as often as I would wish,
it is not for want of attention, or of zeal for the service of our com∣mon
masters, which I consider to be inseparable. I doubt not but dif∣ferent
rumours, which spread from Holland and from France, may have
caused great uneasiness among your friends; and such of them as are
here may testify to you, how sorry I was for this. Yet I did not think,
as things were circumstanced, that I should write much, on account of
the danger; and it was also proper not to write any thing precipitately,
while you might have imagined, that, if I wrote you that affairs were
not as far advanced as was published, I had been ill-informed. But
whatever may be said to you, you may be thoroughly persuaded that no
step was taken on this side, but as much, at least, was done on the other;
and that, if they have alledged, that Mr. Benson [the K. of France]
was willing to finish with his creditors [enemies], without troubling
himself about Mr. Arflie [K. James], they have advanced a very great
falsehood. It was very true, that an attempt was made to settle; but
<PB N="502" REF="524"/>
the factors had not the necessary orders, and would not settle, though
they were much pressed to it. At any rate, we propose nothing now,
but to carry on the law-suit. It is true, Mr Benson's [Fr. King] friends
are embarassed to see, that the course of affairs on your side incline one
to believe, that Mr. Artlie [K. James] hath no friends. Perhaps, if
they had not been in such a hurry to grant every thing to Sawly [K.
William], we would have been more expeditious on our side; and all
that can be said to assure them, that Mr. Artlie [K. James] has friends
still, does not satisfy them. For they say, on the contrary, that they
clearly perceive, by what passes, that his friends have not much influ∣ence
or good intentions. However, we have both here; and, perhaps,
convincing proofs of this may be given soon; at least, I am made to
hope so.</P>
<P>Mr. Toncroft [L. Middleton], in whom they place here all confi∣dence,
and for whom they have all the respect and esteem imaginable,
will advise you of every thing. For nothing is concealed from him of
what I know. I expect, before a fortnight, to be able to write to you
more about these things. I intreat you, Sir, in the mean time, to be
persuaded that I shall not fail in any thing that can contribute to the
success of our common wishes. I am, Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Hope the excuse you make for not writing will be received from me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, vol. vii. 4to. No. 69.</NOTE>

<P>We have been aguish of late; but because I will not depend upon my
own skill in this matter, I send you here inclosed an account of it,
from our physician in ordinary, [the abbé Renaudot,] to whom I refer.
I suppose you will think sit to communicate it to some of our nearest
relations, who are really concerned for the good of the family; who, for
that reason only, endeavour to advance the match proposed to the widow,
<PB N="503" REF="525"/>
whereas there are others, who, without regard to right or wrong, weigh
only their own interests. These last may be discreetly managed, but
ought never to be trusted; because a bribe from the rival certainly gains
them. Mr. Artley [K. James] and his spouse [Queen] bid me assure
you of the great esteem they have for you and yours; and that the
kindness you have expressed for them shall not fail of a suitable return.
I shall omit no occasion of doing you justice; and I shall endeavour, to

<P>ON the 28th of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695. January.</NOTE> 1694, Queen Mary died of the small∣pox;
and the friends of James began to entertain expectations of
a change in his favour, from this event. The first mention of her death,
in Mr. Nairne's papers, is contained in a letter from J. Anderson to
Mr. Applebey, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the earl of Middleton to a correspondent in
England.</P>

<P>I Most thankfully acknowledge the favour of yours of the 6th and 13th
of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> which I could not do by the last post, by reason of
an indisposition caused by a great cold, of which I am not yet quite
recovered. However, I could no longer dispense with my writing to
you, in pursuance of the directions I have received from our consul,
on the occasion of a strong report we have here, that the owner of the
goods No. 535 [princess of Orange] being dead. If it should prove
false, you are earnestly desired to say nothing of it to any body. But
if it should prove true, then you will be convinced, that there will be
enough to set all hands to work. We cannot pretend here to enter into
the particulars of the acts, which must be done by the factors on the
place. But there is one point which seems to be of great importance;
which is, whether the merchant who owns the goods No. 551 [the par∣liament
of England] is broken; there are many good reasons to believe
it, considering the great dependance he had on the other. This would
be the greatest advantage that could happen to the company; because it
was he who supported all the interlopers; and, before a new joint stock
could be made up, the market would be slopt.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="529"/>
Pray present my service to your Hamburgh partner, and tell him,
that I had wrote to him, if I had been at any certainty; and that the
accepted bills will be very quickly paid, and that, if he will make a
considerable venture now, the return will make him the leading man
upon the change.”</P>
<P>The Hamburgh merchant, mentioned so often in Middleton's letters to
Appleby, is supposed to be the earl of Marlborough. The earl of
Middleton wrote another letter of this date, with more particular di∣rections
concerning the measures to be taken by James's friends in par∣liament,
upon the death of the Queen. It is addressed to Mr. Syson,
to the care of Mr. Jackson.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>January 13th, 1695.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 10th of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> which I could not answer
by the last post, because I was ill. You may easily imagine, that to
be well thought of, by one so generally and deservedly esteemed, was
no small satisfaction to me. But no more of this for the future. The
King has commanded me to write to you, that there is here a strong
report that the princess of Orange is dead. If it is false, he desires you
would take no notice of this to any body; nor did he think fit to
wait for the confirmation of it, because his friends might reasonably be
impatient to hear from him on such an extraordinary occasion. Be∣sides
that, our post has been very slow and uncertain of late. But he
is the less uneasy, because he knows his business cannot suffer thereby,
in your hands, since you want no body to prompt or direct you, in
the management of it; and that you do every thing to embroil and
oppose the usurper's affairs, as occasion offers.</P>
<P>If this report is true, the chief thing to be aimed at is the disso∣lution
of this parliament, for which many strong reasons may be urged;
and though I am of opinion, that they will vote themselves still a par∣liament,
yet the contrary ought to be showed in print, for which proper
persons ought to be employed. It will serve to baffle their acts; people
will be more unwilling to pay taxes, or advance any thing on their
security; and, if a succeeding parliament should declare this to have been
null, from such a time, what penalties these members may incur, or
what actions may be brought against them, or those who act by their
<PB N="506" REF="530"/>
authority, ought to be showed, in case still that this report is true. I do
not doubt but you will communicate this to Mr. Donton and other
friends; for I have neither time nor health to do it myself, which would
be but a repetition of the same thing. If there is any thing in this that
you cannot read, Thomas Adams will do it for you.”</P>
<P>Middleton received certain intelligence of the Queen's death on the
fifteenth of January.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> He communicated the news immediately, by letter,
to the marquis de Torcy; in which, he adds, “The King, my master,
does not consider her as his daughter, because she had renounced her
being so in such an open manner. There is even reason to fear that she
died in her impenitence.”</P>
<P>He next wrote the following letter to King James's lord chancellor.</P>

<P>THE King has commanded me to let you know, that he desires you
attend him the morrow-morning. The coachman who delivers
this, will undertake to bring and carry your lordship home again. The
business is to know your opinion, whether, by the inclosed act, the
English parliament is dissolved by the demise of the princess of Orange.
You may be pleased to consider it as you come along. The reason
of this, haste is, that the King of France is to be here to-morrow. In
case your health will not permit you to stir out, his Majesty desires
you would send him your thoughts in writing. I am, with all imagin∣able

<DIV3>
<P>On the twentieth of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> Middleton acquaints the marquis de
Croissy, that his correspondents in England, who sent him news of the
princess of Orange's death, add, “That the most intelligent persons
think that this parliament should be dissolved, but that it would not,
because the members, being judges and parties, will not fail to decide
the cause in their own favour. The King, my master, has already sent
his orders to print all the reasons which can prove the nullity of that
assembly, in order to discredit it in the opinions of the people.”</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="531"/>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF my bad state of health had not hindered me from applying to
business, you would have heard from me frequently. I now take
the liberty to send you reflections on the present state of England, by
Mr. Caryll, which have been already sent to monsieur de Croissy. I am
sure you will avail yourself of them. It is certain, that the conjuncture
is more favourable for an enterprize than it has ever been. But if the
King does not engage in it, all will come to nothing. I was a little
surprised to find, that monsieur de Croissy judged, that the prince of
Orange's affairs were still in a good train; because the parliament had
presented addresses to him. Can any one imagine, that, when there is a
man who is acknowledged as King, and his Queen dies, who had an
equal share of the sovereignty with him, a parliament then assembled
can avoid to make compliments to him upon the occasion. With re∣gard
to the stile, it is mere form; and, with regard to the compliment
at the end, I infer a very favourable conclusion from it. They promise
“to assist him against all his enemies, both domestic and foreign.' They
might say so, if there had been a civil war. But while all is quiet and
obedient, I maintain it is without example.</P>
<P>Here then is an authentic acknowledgment of the two houses of par∣liament,
that there is a party in opposition to the government; and that
it must be very formidable, since they think it necessary to offer him
their assistance against it. This appears to me to be a stronger proof
of the existence of such a party, than any thing we could have said; and
this remark being made by you, will have more weight, and will not be
suspected. For I apprehend sometimes, that they suspect that we want
to impose upon them, which has been always very far from my intention.
But, perhaps, we are obliged for this to lord Melfort.</P>
<P>I send you also the London Gazette, where you will find these ad∣dresses
more exact than any where else. I intreat you to be so good as
to continue the honour of your kindness to, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your most humble and most obedient Servant,

<P>Caryll's reflections on the present state of England, mentioned in the
earl of Middleton's letter to the abbé Renaudot, and sent by his lord∣ship
to the marquis de Croissy, have been preserved among Mr. Nairne's
papers, and are in Nairne's own hand. They appear to have been ad∣dressed
first to James himself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“A memorial concerning the state of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 25.</NOTE> 19 January, 1695.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">“An examination of the P. of O—'s right to the crown at Queen Mary's
death.”</HEAD>
<P>ALL the people of England must necessarily be, at this time, con∣vinced,
that the title of the prince of Orange to the possession of
the crown is not only unjust, in reference to the King and to the prince
of Wales, but also to the princess of Denmark, according to their own
new law, though his Majesty was, as they pretend, excluded by abdi∣cation;
for none of our new law-makers ever pretended, or durst say,
that the crown of England is elective. Wherefore, though by demise
or abdication, or for failure (let them call it what they please) they pre∣tend
the present occupant may be dispossessed, yet still it is an unde∣niable
maxim amongst them all, that, in such cases, it ought to descend
to the next in blood, against whom no such incapacity lies.</P>
<P>Nor let it be said, that the modern act of settlement creates a sufficient
and just title to the prince of Orange, for his present holding the
crown: for it is the opinion of my lord Coke and all the ablest lawyers,
that an act of parliament, visibly contrary, either to the divine law or
common justice, is void in itself: and nothing can be more apparently
contrary to justice, according to their own maxims, than to prefer, in
the succession to the crown, the prince of Orange, a foreigner, and re∣moter
by one degree, to the princess of Denmark, a native and your
immediate heir. It is certain, that those very persons, who concurred
to the making of this law, did it upon a supposition that the prince of
Orange could not out-live his wife; he appearing, at that time, far
gone in an asthma, and she of a vigorous and healthy constitution;
which made them bestow, in the heat of their kindness, that compli∣ment
upon him, not to unking him upon the death of his wife, which
then they thought would prove but a bare compliment, though now it
falls out otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="533"/>
Of this neither the prince of Orange nor the English nation in ge∣neral
are ignorant. We are, therefore, to consider what effects may
thence naturally follow, and how each of them will be moved to act,
according to their several principles and interests: for now, more than
ever, he and the nation are perfectly two.</P>
<P>To make a judgment of what effects it may have upon the English
nation, we must consider severally the two great parties into which it is
divided, viz. the church of England-men monarchical, and the dis∣senters
republican, by thir principles. As to those of the church of Eng∣land,
it is evident, that, by the death of the princess of Orange, and
the reigning alone of her husband, they not only lose all hopes of con∣tinuing
uppermost, as by the laws in force they ought to be, but are
in danger of their very being. For they well know, that this prince was
bred a presbyterian; and, that since his usurpation, he has sufficiently
demonstrated what his inclinations are, by abolishing episcopacy in Scot∣land,
and even in England, by his putting in of late, to all offices and
places of trust [bishopricks not excepted], Presbyterians, or Latitudi∣narians.</P>
<P>Whilst the princess lived, the church of England were at some ease
and thought themselves safe, by the countenance and encouragement
they received from her, who was educated by them; and also, by the
great hopes they had of her surviving her husband. But he now reign∣ing
alone, in his own right, it may easily be imagined what their senti∣ments
and apprehensions are; and how they are disposed to free themselves
from a dominion, so unfound at the bottom in title, and so little favour∣able
to them.</P>
<P>It ought particularly to be remarked, that in all the times of monar∣chy,
the church of England-party has ever prevailed, in the house of
commons, notwithstanding all the efforts, which have not been small, of
the dissenters to the contrary; and that house being the bulky and
weighty part of the nation, and having the purse, all Englishmen in
general naturally lean to their side; so that the episcopal-party, supported
by the house of commons, will certainly stand their ground, and prove
a dangerous enemy to the prince of Orange, who can only secure him∣self,
by making use of his foreigners to bring both them and their sup∣porters
under subjection.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="534"/>
As to the dissenters, their propension to the prince of Orange, is not
Out of any love to him, but only caused by their opposition to the church
of England, and by their aversion to monarchy in general. For they
think it an easier step, from a wrong King to no King, than from a right
King; and, for the same reason, they will better endure the reign of
a woman, than of a man, which will not a little make for the princess of
Denmark, if ever she come to a contest with the prince of Orange: for
these dissenters being of a true republican spirit, can naturally bear no
superiority, either in church or state; and, next to having no rulers
over them, the weakest will always be most acceptable to them. But
these men must be considered, not under the notion of dissenters, but
also as Englishmen; and, upon that national account, they will as vio∣lently
oppose the domination of strangers, as any other English subjects
whatsoever. So that, if the prince of Orange shall think himself obliged,
for his own security, to awe the nation by foreign troops, all that is
English, even army and navy, will certainly join, as one man, to keep
them out.</P>
<P>To this must be added the haughty and morose humour of that prince,
which could not fail to extinguish all affection for his person. It is true,
the contrary behaviour of the princess of Orange and her popular affa∣bility
did, in some measure, appease, or, at least, cover the general disgust
conceived against him. But she being dead, nothing can hinder an in∣crease
of aversion between him and the people; and both must proceed
in their own natural ways, he to disoblige and they to resent.</P>
<P>It is easy to judge what the consequences may be of this present state of
affairs and disposition of minds in England. The prince of Orange
can no otherwise support the weakness of his title, against the manifest
right of his Majesty, according to the old true law, or against that of the
princess of Denmark, according to their new model, and secure to himself
the possession of the crown, but by transporting into England an army
of foreigners sufficient to overawe the nation. But this is what no
English parliament, though never so much pensionary, no English army,
no English fleet will ever endure; and yet it is not more than probable,
considering the circumstanccs of his affairs and his own natural jealousy,
that he will attempt to do it, not all of a sudden, but by degrees. But
then, by the same degrees will also increase the jealousy of the English,
<PB N="511" REF="535"/>
till, at last, it must break out into open hostility. This opportunity
should not be lost by his most Christian Majesty, of humbling an enemy,
who has raised and leads all the forces in Europe against France; and of
reducing him to an impossibility of doing any more hurt, no more than
by the King of England, for the recovery of his crown. That the oc∣casion
may not be lost to both, it will be necessary, that a competent
number of troops and ships may always be in a readiness, upon the first
commotions in England, to support the contrary party to the prince of
Orange; otherwise, should he prevail in that struggle, and reduce Eng∣land
as he has done Holland, under a perfect subjection, he would be∣come
a more dangerous enemy than ever. It is not to be expected, that,
upon the first risings, any declaration will be made in behalf of his Ma∣jesty,
but their pretensions will be to assert the indisputable right (com∣paratively
to his) of a princess born in England, against an intruding
foreigner, or rather upon a national account, to preserve England from
being overrun with strangers. A ready seasonable support from France,
upon such an occasion, will not only have the effect of turning the ba∣lance
against the prince of Orange, but will also determine the opposite
party to him, to declare for their lawful King; whose restoration is, per∣haps,
the only means of any lasting peace, that, can be had with honour
and advantage.</P>
<P>There is no likelihood that Marlborough could have been forgotten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE>
during the intrigues which followed the death of Queen Mary. Middleton,
in a letter to his correspondent Appleby, on the 30th of January, 1695,
mentions an application which was then made to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> “I suppose you
will be surprised to see an old country gentlewoman of your acquaintance,
who will deliver you bills for 86 [lord Churchill]. She knows nothing
of it. I have no directions for you about them; but to deliver them
immediately to whom they are payable; for an honest and wise man
never places his favours, but where he has an entire confidence; and you
may assure your Hamburgh partner of both.”</P>
<P>The old country gentlewoman, was Mr. Radcliffe, who went with
letters to St. Germains, on the Queen's death; and from Middleton's
answer to a letter which he received from Appleby, after the departure
<PB N="512" REF="536"/>
of Mr. Radcliffe, it appears that the Hamburgh merchant was the earl
of Marlborough.</P>

<P>About this time, Middleton corresponded with No. 18 [colonel Gra∣ham],
who was a spy, employed by King William. Middleton was a
man of some humour and learning; and he sometimes threw a mixture of
both into his letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> on the most serious subjects. It appears from his
answers, that Graham, who wanted to make himself of consequence to his
employers, complained bitterly, that he received too little intelligence;
and Middleton, who perhaps suspected him, protested that he wrote with
sincerity and plainness, though he indulged a little innocent raillery,
when he had nothing material to communicate.</P>
<P>The letter sent from England<NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE>, in August, 1694, gave, probably, a
true account of the state of things in that country; but it was natural
enough for King James to see them in a different light, when the fa∣vourites

and assured his rival of the success of an invasion.</P>

<P>I Have received the letter, which your Majesty did me the honour to
write to me, on the 24th of February, with the postscript of the 4th
of March, precisely as the courrier was setting out; so that it was im∣possible
<PB N="513" REF="537"/>
for me to answer it, by the last opportunity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> and I had some
hopes, to be able to send you, by the present, a letter from lord Sunder∣land;
having brought about an interview between him and bishop Lay∣burn.
My lord has confirmed to the bishop all I wrote to you in his
name, in my former letters, with which I am very well pleased. He
has been so much occupied all this week, that he could not write, at this
time; but you may depend, that you will have a letter from him, by the
first packet; and, at the same time, you may be assured, that I shall
neglect nothing which depends upon me, in serving your Majesty.
They are the slow measures, which are taking on your side, that ruin
every thing, and render your friends timid and distrustful; who, otherwise,
would be willing to act and to hazard all, if they saw, on the side of
France, a greater disposition to undertake any thing against England.
It is not these extraordinary precautions and long delays, that will ever
do the business. I am assured, that his most Christian Majesty can never
employ his forces more advantageously, both for himself and for your
Majesty, than by making an effort on this side, which is not so imprac∣ticable
as they imagine, either with regard to the number of troops or man∣ner
of transporting them. It is true, the greater the number of the
troops, the more certain will be the success. But it is not necessary to
have more, than can be easily transported: for 20 or 25,000 men will be
sufficient. That number will contribute more, at present, in England, to
finish the war, than 100,000 men employed in any place whatever. But
if other measures are taken, there is no remedy. I am persuaded they
will repent of them. It is impossible to add any thing to what hath been
so often repeated upon this subject. It is not even necessary to urge
your Majesty to a thing, that is so much your interest. Since I came
from Scotland, I have always beseeched your Majesty to let me know,
what your Majesty's servants and friends, in this country, should do, on
their part, in order to induce his most Christian Majesty, to engage in this
enterprize: for without that, there is nothing to be done. It appears
to us, that it is his interest as much as your Majesty's; but of this, he
himself is the best judge.</P>
<P>I know, that your Majesty receives exact accounts of all that passes in
parliament; therefore, I shall say nothing on the subject. There are
great heats and contests among these gentlemen; but that will not hinder
<PB N="514" REF="538"/>
the affair of the subsidy. The lower house are to choose another speaker
to-morrow.</P>
<P>With regard to news, it is certain, that the preparations that are made
here for the Mediterranean, are designed for attacking Toulon, if it is
possible. It is lord Sunderland who has given me in charge to assure
your Majesty of this; but he told me, at the same time, that he does
not believe the enterprize will take place, because he is persuaded, that
it will not be found practicable, when they come to put it in execution.
At any rate, they are resolved, at present, to try to execute it.</P>
<P>I conclude, with intreating your Majesty, to permit me here, to
assure the Queen of my very humble respects, and to declare myself to
be, with all submission, duty, and obedience,</P>
<CLOSER>Your Majesty's, &amp;c.</CLOSER>

<P>The earl of Middleton's letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.—June.</NOTE> at this time, are mostly allegorical,
and consequently not easily explained. But it appears, in general, that
he was corresponding with some men of the first consequence in England,
and that the adherents of James were daily increasing.</P>
<P>On the 13th of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> he writes to Mr. Mordant: “I always told you,
that the angels in heaven rejoiced at the conversion of a sinner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He means, perhaps, the duke of Devonshire, who seems to have lost his aversion to
James, in some affront, which he received from William.</NOTE>; and,
that every man should be rewarded according to his works. I am glad
to hear, that an old friend of mine is justified. It is very plain, that there
was a design of putting a public affront on him: if he bears it pa∣tiently,
he is much altered.”</P>
<P>Middleton writes, on the sixth of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> to a correspondent, under the
borrowed name of Mrs. Dorille: “Fraser can speak to Pembroke and
Devonshire, and you can speak yourself to I [lord Abergaveny] and
Godolphin; and lady Devonshire and Bradbury can to the Leaper.”</P>
<P>He writes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> of the same date, to No. 7 [the bishop of Bath and
Wells].</P>
<P>I Am glad of this opportunity of inclosing Mr. Artley's [K. James's] let∣ter
to you, to assure you of the great regard I have for your friendship,
of which I have had many remarkable instances, which is confirmed to me
<PB N="515" REF="539"/>
by several hands. Those of your family cannot be ignorant, that I had the
happiness of being born and bred in it; and, if they are not already, I
hope they will be quickly convinced, that I have never proved undutiful;
and it is a common artifice of people's enemies, to make them jealous
of their friends. Unforeseen accidents may defer the best resolutions;
but reason and interest will prevail, when it is practicable and those we
deal with are convinced, which is the principal point; and, therefore,
I hope nobody will despond. All your friends here are in perfect health;
and I am most sincerely, &amp;c.</P>

Majesty's restoration, than they were at first, in advancing the revolu∣tion.
Besides, the management of the church affairs, in Scotland, has
created in them a reasonable jealousy of their fate at home. The second
class is that of the fanaticks, who the prince of Orange has broke his
word with, in every article; it being his promise, that he would not
assume to himself even the pretence of being King, the very name of
which, as well as a monarchical government, they hate to an antipathy.
But when their principles are rightly weighed, and a calculation made of
the slightness of their power, they are apparently too contemptible to be
solicited for their assistance, upon any account; for they are a sort of
people, whose practices have ever demonstrated, that they have no notion
of honour; though this may be said of them, that as they are too selfish to
do good to the cause, so it may be very reasonably inferred, they will
scarce run the hazard of making an opposition. So that, if your Ma∣jesty
is secure of meeting with the friendship of the first, and that the
other will give no obstruction, the encouragement for your Majesty to
take this opportunity will still be greater, when the bulk of the nation
(taking it under the title of the popularity) are declared enemys to the
present constitution; and, as slender taxes have ever been attended in
England, with the discontents of the people, so it is not to be won∣dered
at, when the subsidies are so prodigious, that groans and outcrys
are spread throughout the kingdom, and to that degree, that it is rare
to hear any body speak of the government without a curse, and at the
same time, begging for a speedy deliverance.</P>
<P>But besides all this, your Majesty is sensible of the sincere affections and
entire zeal of a great number of your subjects, whose loyalty, in this un∣happy
interval, has never suffered the least taint, and their readiness to
obey any of your Majesty's commands has never failed of appearing, and
whose whole business it is, to be perpetually employing themselves in
engaging others, which has already been effected with such success, that,
by a modest computation, the better part of the army in England is sure
to serve your Majesty, whenever they are called on, particularly the
battalions of foot guards and the royal regiment of horse; and, as there
is no room for doubting of the fidelity of these friends of your Majesty's,
so their credit, when they make promises to your Majesty, can never fail
of weight.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="541"/>
These were the preliminaries, that were thought expedient for me to
lay before your Majesty. First, then, I was to acquaint you with a reso∣lution,
that they had come to, and which they concluded a considerable
inducement for your Majesty to make an attempt with a small force,
which they esteem 10,000 men to be, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>000 of which to be horse, 1000
with equipage intended for dragoons, and 8000 foot. This is a number
which is thought the King of Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> can spare at any time, especially
when the success is so morally certain, and, by that means, your Majesty
restored, and his whole difficulty with the allies finished at once.</P>
<P>What they assure your Majesty of performing on their parts is (if this
number can be complied with, and they advertised of the month that
your Majesty intends a descent), they will have 2000 horse ready, with
men and all accoutrements fit for service, either to march directly to the
place where you resolve to land at, or else to march any other way that
your Majesty shall order, to give a diversion and an amusement to the
troops of the government that may be upon motion. If your Majesty
makes use of them to attend your landing, they will, at the same time,
engage the mounting the thousand men with horses, which are designed
for dragoons; and, though they have fixt only upon this number of
2000, yet I am to let your Majesty know they verily believe they shall
make them 4000, and it may be 10,000.</P>
<P>This proposal is made to make things as easy to the King of France
as possible, it being their opinion the horses cannot be conveniently
spared. Besides that, a great number of horse would take up so many
ships, that in the time they were getting ready, the alarm would be taken,
and of consequence an obstruction given; whereas, for the number de∣sired,
thirty transport ships, with eight or ten frigates from Dunkirk, are
sufficient, and there will be no necessity of being embarrassed with more
than four or five days provisions aboard, the coast of England being so
near, and there being no possibility of wanting wherever you land. If
the confederate fleet be an objection to this, supposing a squadron of
them to lie before Dunkirk, it is believed, that, if the King of France
will give a false alarm at Brest, some time before he thinks of putting
this proposal in execution, by embarking 5 or 6000 there, as it may be
naturally supposed that the prince of Orange and the government of
England will receive a quick advertisement of it, so it will take off any
<PB N="518" REF="542"/>
suspicion of what is to be done at Dunkirk, and will of course divert the
whole fleet to observe what they will expect from Brest. But, because a
projection of this nature may possibly be thought more feasible when
the campaign is over, it is necessary to represent to your Majesty the
apprehensions we are under, that the prince of Orange will return with
an army of foreigners: for he is sensible how many men of quality he
has disgusted, by leaving them out of this new commission, and by put∣ting
into that power and trust persons of less quality and interest than
themselves: so that he has reason to apprehend, that such usage will be
attended with resentments; and besides, by some violent proceedings in
the last sessions of that parliament, he was with difficulty brought to suf∣fer
them to fit any longer; but the pressing instances of some at the helm,
and the present necessity he was under for money, besides the reflections
that the allies would have made upon his parting with his parliament in
a heat, forced him to lay aside the thoughts of dissolving them then.
But, that he will call a new one upon his return, is what every body ex∣pects
and depends upon; and as it has always been an observation in
England, that the dissolution of one parliament never produced a better,
so the prince of Orange has only recourse to an army to intimidate them
into a compliance, since his measures of bribery are like to fall to the
ground; and if this should arrive, your Majesty will consider, that then
you must come with an army, at least equivalent to what he will have
in England.</P>
<P>I must likewise lay before your Majesty an opinion, which is generally
received even by the great men in the government, which they have de∣clared
upon occasional discourse (supposing the King of France could
assist your Majesty before the prince of Orange returns from Flanders);
which is this, that if your Majesty were once landed, whoever should
oppose you would be rebels; for that all the world knows your Majesty
is King <HI>de jure,</HI> and when landed you are King <HI>de facto</HI> too: so that
then the prince of Orange is divested of all pretensions, even by his
friends. But if your Majesty cannot have this opportunity afforded you,
but to have it deferred till winter, when the prince of Orange is there,
those in the government will still look upon him to be King in possession;
and, in all probability, those who would otherwise have acquiesced, and
have given your Majesty no opposition, will be then under an obligation
<PB N="519" REF="543"/>
of acting to their power, for the prince of Orange. These are the senti∣ments
of your friends, and they are with all submission referred to your
Majesty as the best judge.”</P>

<P>That it will be necessary, Sir John Fenwick should have a commission,

<P><PB N="520" REF="544"/>
The same subject is continued in the following paper.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“Reasons most humbly offered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairre's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 24.</NOTE> why ten thousand men are sufficient and safe
for the King in person to make, at this time, a descent upon England; with
a proposal for making the said descent.”</HEAD>
<P>1st, THAT the whole force now in England are but 14,000 men,
5000 whereof are to be immediately sent abroad; so that there
will remain in England but about 9000. Of this number 3000, at
least, must be left to maintain the face of a government at London; and
3000 more are the fewest which can be allowed for the garrisons; so
that there will not be above 3000 left to take the field whatever happen,
and even of these the King may hope for some share; for amongst the
whole there are not above 1600 foreigners.</P>
<P>2dly, That the great alterations occasioned by the princess of Orange's
death, hath so broke and divided the strength of the government, that
10,000 men are more now in proportion to its present strength, than
30,000 were before: for the whole church of England party, who were
for him only upon her account, are now intirely broke off; and even
those of them, who have no inclinations for the King, are fallen into the
princess of Denmark.</P>
<P>3dly, That the nation being thus divided into three parties, the prince
of Orange's must certainly be the least, for many plain reasons; but
especially this, that no man will be so mad as to oppose himself to the
King and his son, the princess of Denmark and her son, for the single
life of the prince of Orange, since, after his death, they must unavoid∣ably
fall into some of their hands, even though they were secure during
his life, which no wise man will think himself.</P>
<P>4thly, That, since the design and desire of both parties against him is
to destroy him, it is plain either of them would join with the other so to
do, and consequently also plain, that both joined would be much too
strong for him. What then can give the King any doubt, when he will
be joined by the princess's party and his own, which will certainly com∣prehend
every body either from affection or fear?</P>
<P>5thly, That the great confusion and ferment through almost the
whole kingdom, upon the princess of Orange's death, is a plain and
<PB N="521" REF="545"/>
demonstrative proof, that the inclinations of the people are for the King,
and not thinking upon any other change: for the cry in the mouths of
the mobs was, freedom from taxes and foreigners and a restoration of
their ancient laws and constitutions.</P>
<P>6thly, That the present parliament (which is the only support the
prince of Orange hath to trust to, even though they should stand by
him, upon such a juncture, which cannot be supposed) will be of no
great weight for him or against the King: for they are hated and sus∣pected
by the people, and not at all speaking their sense, as appears by
what follows, viz.</P>
<P>What is the reason that this parliament hath, for these several last
sessions, pressed and endeavoured its own dissolution? The answer is
plain, because it knows that its dissolution is desired by the people it re∣presents,
whose resentments it fears for sitting so long against their inten∣tions.
What then is the reason, why the people desires the dissolution
of this parliament? The answer is also plain, because they look upon
them to be corrupted and acting contrary to their interest and intentions.</P>
<P>What strength then does the junction of this parliament add to the
prince of Orange? No more than he hath force to give a sanction to: for
it is not the sanction of a parliament, which the people hate and wish dis∣solved,
that makes them comply with its acts, but the force that is upon
them from the prince of Orange; and consequently, whenever there is
a superior force opposed to this force, all that such a parliament can do
will rather hurt than save him.</P>
<P>So that, from all these reasons, it is plain the King hath no ground to
fear any opposition, that may be made either from the army, the coun∣try,
or the parliament; but, on the contrary, strong reasons to hope all
their concurrence, and consequently can run no hazard, either as to safety
or success, in going with 10,000 men.</P>
<P>And to effect the making this descent, since captain Bart is of opinion
that, it the shipping were ready, an army and all things necessary might
be embarked in 48 hours, which is so short a time, that no alarm could
be given; it is most humbly proposed, that his Majesty would be
pleased to press, with all vigour, that the King of France would have the
shipping ready to wait for an occasion: for several will most certainly hap∣pen,
<PB N="522" REF="546"/>
before the summer be at an end, in which such an army may be
safely transported, without any danger from the English fleet: for, if
they should but go to the mouth of the Channel, or to Spithead, the
common place of their rendezvous (all things being ready at Dunkirk as
is proposed), the King might be embarked and over and landed, before
even they could have any notice; and so (according to all probability)
possess himself of his crowns without any resistance.</P>
<P>And that, which is yet more encouraging for the King to press this
proposal, and for the court of France to undertake it, is, that, if any
unforeseen accident fall in between this and the executing of it, which
may either change against the King the circumstances of affairs there, or
prevent the transportation, the further progress of it may be easily and
safely stopt, without any considerable loss or noise; the whole expence
of preparing the shipping, even upon the supposition of 20,000, being
estimated by captain Bart, not to exceed 100,000 livres. But lest this
plain easy method of restoring the King may seem liable to this objec∣tion,
that, though so small a number, by taking advantage of such a sur∣prize,
and the prince of Orange being unprovided with troops there, be
sufficient for the King to regain his kingdoms; yet they are not of force
enough to secure him against what the prince of Orange may be further
able to attempt against him. To clear up that difficulty, be pleased to
consider, where the prince of Orange may be, what he may endeavour
to do, and what may be the success of these endeavours.</P>
<P>As to the first, he will certainly, if alive, be either in England or
abroad. If in England, it is not improbable, but he may fall into the
King's hands, and so there's an end. But, though he may escape, it will
be so mean and ignominious to have been beat out of possession himself
in person, considering what he makes be believed abroad of the affec∣tions
of the people for him, that none of his allies will ever think it
worth their while to make a fresh attempt to restore him, though they
were in circumstances so to do, which shall, by what follows, be made
appear otherwise. But it being more probable, that he will be then
abroad, be pleased to take a view of what he may endeavour to do, and
what success his endeavours may have.</P>
<P>It may then be supposed, that he will then endeavour to get 20 or
30,000 good troops immediately transported with himself into England;
<PB N="523" REF="547"/>
and that it is the interest of the allies to grant him such a number. But
to shew, that his endeavours will be unsuccessful upon this, be pleased
to consider the following reasons:</P>
<P>Ist, That this will happen when the armies are in the field, a time that
such a number cannot be spared, without exposing, for want of them,
both the confederate army and their countries, which they cannot be sup∣posed
to consent to, especially considering how little they will then trust
to above 30,000 British amongst them, whom they will much rather be
afraid of then rely upon.</P>
<P>2d, That the allies (were there no other reason) will never consent to
exposing so many of their troops on the other side, upon so dangerous
and uncertain an event, especially considering what mutual satisfaction
will then publickly appear between the King and his people; add to
these reasons the hatred bore him in Holland, the enmity between him
and the Elector of Bavaria, and the great disposition of all the branches
of the confederates for a peace; and then consider, if it be not much
more reasonable to believe, that they will abandon him and treat with
France: for he will then have no money (as heretofore) to bribe mini∣sters
and others, which is the only charm he ever used to keep him and
them cemented.</P>
<P>But next consider, that, though the allies should come over, all these
reasons (which cannot well be supposed) and resolve to run all hazards
for him, and lend him 20 or 30,000 men, yet how can he get them
transported, provided or paid; for then the source of his money will be
stopped, and not only so, but in the King's hands, to be employed against
him; and what little sums he may have left in Flanders will bear no
proportion to this matter, for these he hath only from hand to mouth;
and all his friends abroad joined together will not be able, at that time,
to furnish him with a sum sufficient for this expedition.</P>
<P>But suppose, that all this were possible for the prince of Orange,
(which cannot be supposed) yet the very fleet of England now for him
will then be against him, and prevent the transporting of any army.
For the King then, at Whitehall, in possession of his kingdoms, master
of all the strengths and stores, and of the very money given this sessions
to the prince of Orange, a third part whereof will not be collected, will
<PB N="524" REF="548"/>
most certainly have the fleet in all places declare for him; for though not
from affection, they must of necessity do it. Nor can it be supposed,
that the fleet will ever go otherwise, than the kingdom, or espouse against
their own country an interest upon a Dutch bottom, which they so much
hate; and, which is yet more, all their families and fortunes will be in
the King's power; so that their joining the King is not to be doubted,
and how then can the prince of Orange transport an army though he
had one?</P>
<P>So that there is a chain of plain reasons, every link of it stronger than
another, which, according to all human reason, renders it altogether im∣possible
for the prince of Orange to make any fresh attempt upon the
King, if he were once so restored. Add to all this, what may rationally
be supposed to happen, upon the King's immediately sending an envoy
into Flanders to offer his mediation for peace and the security of the
British troops there, and then consider, if it be not very plain, that this
small number proposed to restore his Majesty is also sufficient to preserve
him when restored, against all the further attempts of the prince of
Orange. There are also many other reasons which might be joined to
these, as the whole kingdom being then desperate with the prince of
Orange, the great number of known friends to the King, who never
took the oaths to him; all which his Majesty might arm upon any occa∣sion,
and who would as certainly fight for him, when on his throne, as
they suffered and ventured their lives and fortunes for him when in exile.</P>
<P>In a letter written in cyphers about this time, by John Anderson to the
Hamburgh merchant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Hamburgh merchant is frequently mentioned in Middleton's letters to his correspondent Appleby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> On the 13th of May, he writes to him: “I the more earnestly desired yours, that I might be the more particularly informed concerning the Hamburgh partner, from whom I have not heard of a great while, which you may know, for I never had any of his letters but under your cover. I shall not write to him, till I hear further from you. If you think of any particular thing, that you judge proper for me to say to him, pray give me a hint of it; for some matters must be managed with great caution, and you can best judge on the place. I wonder the less, that I should be igno∣rant of his contract, since you are. Though I am confident he means well; yet I beg you would let me know what you can observe; nor is it fit to show him this.”</P>
<P>He writes to him again, on the 27th of May: “I most thankfully acknowledge the favour of yours of the seventeenth of April. Things are here just in the condition when I writ last to you. But, in your town, by this time, matters must have another face, be∣cause of the new magistrates: for which reason, I think it would be fit, that the Ham∣burgh partner should give the consul an account how far the interest of the company may be concerned in it, and of what may be adviseable in this conjuncture; and, in the mean time, to bestir himself.”</P></NOTE> [or Lord Middleton to a member of parliament,]

<P>All the other letters from England never say anything, but to make

He writes to Appleby, on the sixth of June: “As to the bale of goods, No. 219 [Fr. fleet], if you will consider and believe what I write to you concerning it, I need say no more of it. However, I shall only add, that, till it is brought into its proper ware∣house, which depends on accidents, it can never turn to good account.”
He writes to Chapman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> on the 29th of June: “I am concerned, that I cannot answer our wishes at present; and merely for the reason I have so often informed you of: for I find no other objection made; but, on the contrary, very great forwardness, when that is removed; and then you may begin to look out sharp, if things continue in the same situ∣ation they are in at this time.” On the 12th of July, he writes to Appleby. “I could wish, with all my heart, that the account you have of the goods 219 [Fr. fleet] were true. It is not likely that the owner of them would let them rot in the warehouse, at a time when he could dispose of them to so great advantage.”
On the 17th of August,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> he writes to Chapman. “Our friend Benson [Fr. King] has put his money out to use at present; so that he cannot advance ten pounds. Whereas, his rents will come in again, after Michaelmas quarter-day; and, about that time, all his goods will be in the proper ware-houses; so that there will not be the same reason for putting off for the future.”</P>
<P>Of the same date he writes to Cleland, <HI>i. e.</HI> Waugh. “We are at no certainty yet, when our long law suit can be brought to a trial. But we are in good hopes, since the excuse our lawyers made will be removed very quickly.”</P>
<P>Middleton's correspondents in England seemed to have been afraid at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. 410. No. 5.</NOTE> that their intrigues might be discovered by a person who had come over from St. Ger∣mains. His lordship writes to Ward, [col Sackville] on the 18th Oct. “You cannot imagine how vexed I have been to hear of a rogue's being in your parts, who lived some time here: for I am very sensible that he may do a great deal of mischief. But, because some good-natured people may make fine stories, I shall only mention these short facts. He had no leave, nor ever asked it. If he had, care should have been taken to have hindered him. He was offered service; but he declined it, choosing rather to work at his trade; for which purpose he was supplied with what he asked. But it seems that honest way of living appearing too painful, he stole away to follow his inclinations.”</P>
<P>On the same day, he writes to Green [Sir Andrew Forrester.] “We never heard that the blacksmith you mention was gone from hence, till it came from your parts. Many others, you know, are gone from hence, because they could subsist no longer; and I hope no body will be so unjust, as to make any here responsible for their actions. What I am most concerned for is, the indiscretion of one I mention to you in very general terms, by order of the president [K. James], who gave him no commission; and all I said to him was reserve, caution, and circumspection.

<P>WE have just now received letters from England of the 26th October,

the parliament, and called another to meet the 2d of December.</P>
<P>The two greatest difficulties in the enterprize against England, consist
in the safety of the transports, and in the means which the English, who
are loyal, may find to assemble themselves together after the landing, in
order to join their King or make a diversion: and now that Rooke
is sailed, the coasts are without shipping, and all the people met together
for new elections, which would be the best pretext that could be wished
for; but, above all, the great credit of lord Sunderland, who has been
always the first to deceive himself, and the first to betray. But all these
advantages will become useless, on account of our being unprepared to
profit by them.</P>
<P>They write likewise, that the prince of Orange is to travel through
the counties for twenty-six days, in order to acquire applause, and to
contribute to the election of his creatures. They say, that eight mil∣lions
sterling will be demanded of the parliament, and that the settle∣ment
of the crown will be changed, by preferring the children which he
may have to the princess Anne of Denmark; and that lord Danby will
be disgraced, <HI>sed de suturis contingentibus non datur determinata veritas.</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received yours of the 26th of August and 23d of September,
which came to my hands about ten days after the other, and both of
them within these three weeks. I am sorry for the good reasons you give
me, of not hearing oftener from you and the worthy persons you name;
and I am very sensible both of the difficulty and danger you are in when
you do send; and it is for that reason you do not hear oftener from me,
because of the hazard of intercepting my letters, which to you might
prove troublesome: for, though in other matters you may imagine us in
great misery, yet in this we are, both in sending and receiving, in great
security, and therefore I shall be always very cautious in exposing of
you, but when there is good cause for it; and when that is, I will not
fail of giving you timely advertisement, and that with as much security
as I can contrive.</P>
<P>Be not, therefore, anxious in exposing yourselves by writing often,
or expecting often to hear from me. When there is any thing material
upon your side, I know you will let us have it; and for what is com∣mon,
such as the state of the present forces of the kingdom, may be
done by way of a common News Letter, without exposing any body,
and yet as much said as we shall want to know.</P>
<P>The King is very sensible of your great endeavours for him; and you
may be persuaded that, upon all occasions, I shall give a just account of
you and others as I am informed. Doctor Cockburn has left his cyphers
with me, and you may, as you have occasion, continue to write by
them. I am glad to hear of my lord Strathmore's good inclinations be∣fore
his death, and of the good opinion you have of his son, as I am of
Tarbat and Queensberry's good behaviour in the parliament, which
should be enco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raged; and that the discontents among our enemies prove
for our advantage, and that our friends persevere, which, in a great
measure, is beholding to the good management of you and your partners.</P>
<P><PB N="530" REF="554"/>
The King is very sensible of the good behaviour of the clergy and the
bishops; and I have taken particular notice what you say of the bishop
of Edinburgh. The King intreats all of you to continue and dispose of
every thing for the best; that, when it pleaseth God to give the oppor∣tunity,
things may be found in a readiness.</P>
<P>I do not remember that the two priests said any thing of your affairs;
and I am sure doctor Cockburn gave me no letter of the 25th February
from you. I keep very carefully all your letters that I have received
from him, and I find none of that date amongst them.</P>
<P>I have told you formerly, that the King was resolved to have no secre∣taries
of state for Scotland, till he be on the other side, as you have ad∣vised
him, and you may depend upon it; for he is still in the same mind.</P>
<P>People coming from hence is not our fault: we have not wherewith
to maintain them. But if there be any amongst them that pretends to
have been trusted, or to deliver messages, do not believe them. You
have been at this sport before, and may remember of the straits you
were in; and that it was no more in the King's power then, than it is
now, to help it. As for scribblers, if you can fix any thing upon any
person here, it would be good service. But I assure you the little affairs
we have is in so few hands, that you may depend upon it, if you be
not deceived by the persons you trust, you shall not by any means of
ours.</P>
<P>Sir Andrew Forrester went from hence by his own choice and desire;
the condition of his affairs obliging him to it.</P>
<P>I take what secretary Johnston said to you to be pumping and no
more; and I think it's easy for you to consider what letters could be
wrote to you from hence. I understand mine came safe, and you may
know if Dr. Cockburn's did or not, or if you had any other correspon∣dents.
By examining, in this manner, you will easily find what letters
could come to you, and so will the rest; and I will be so cautious in
bringing you into danger that way, that you may all be persuaded I
will only trouble you when it is material and absolutely necessary; and I
intreat all of you to believe me your most faithful humble servant,</P>

<HEAD>Negociations at Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 19.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>Cardinal Howard corresponded with James and his ministers in the
year 1693. Bishop Ellis likewise wrote them several letters in the course
of that and the following year; giving an account of his negociations
and solicitations at Rome, and endeavouring to make himself pass for a
man of consequence. He frequently insinuated that Caprara, who, as
agent for the Queen, managed her concerns at Modena, and without
asking any reward, or being invested with any character, exerted himself
in promoting James's interests at Rome, was suspected of favouring the
Austrians. Ellis, however, was never authorised to appear in any public
character; and he was ordered to repair to his diocese soon after the
earl of Perth arrived this year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 129.</NOTE> There are copies of answers to some of
his letters from James and secretary Caryll.</P>
<P>The duke of Modena, brother to the Queen of England, was suc∣ceeded
by his brother who was a cardinal. The Queen thought she had
pretensions to something on the death of her brother, and James sent
the earl of Perth to Modena to settle them with the cardinal duke. His
credentials and instructions are dated the 3d of November, 1694.</P>
<P>The earl of Perth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 36.</NOTE> who had been lately freed from his imprisonment in
Scotland, and was now travelling abroad, begins his correspondence
with Caryll and Nairne from Modena,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 129.</NOTE> the 14th of April, 1695. From
Modena he was directed to go to Rome, and credentials and instructions
were sent to him in the beginning of March. He was instructed to
consult in every thing Dom. Guillelmo Lesly, to convince the Pope that
James lost his crown for professing the Catholic Religion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that his Ho∣liness
was therefore bound to oppose a peace which might prejudice his
interest. He was also desired to consider which of the cardinals James should
nominate to be protector of the British dominions, and to solicit money.</P>

<P>“I AM trying, by Dom. Guilielmo Lesly's informations, how this
court is inclined; and I find that artifice and juggle has so misre∣presented
the state of the affair of the usurpation, that, as if men had
resolved either to appear such fools as to be imposed upon by mere
open villany, or such professed wicked persons, as to own to support all
the monstrous injustice done his Majesty, and the persecutions brought
<PB N="532" REF="556"/>
upon his catholic subjects; they will appear persuaded, that to humble
France, by any means, was not only lawful, but a necessary duty.”</P>
<P>June 6th, 1695. Monseigneur Caprara is full of business, and speaks
very seldom to me of affairs, especially the King's. I find he has no
hopes of the King's restoration, (if he deals sincerely by me;) and really
all here (if one should take six for one to be the all) are very cold in
our concerns. Press them with the injustice the King meets with. You
will get a cold, “Yes, he is ill dealt by: but what shall we do to get
a peace? For the prince, if he lives, will reign, no doubt: but how
turn out the prince of Orange? He is in possession. He is brave and
wise, and has got the way of managing England. He is master of
Holland: he is the cement that glues together the different interests of
the confederacy. If, at last, the collegati should fail him; if England
should grow uneasy, he has money laid up, an army at his devotion,
and will trouble Europe, if he get not leave to live out his usurped pos∣session?”
This is the common talk; and even some we look on as our
firm friends, insinuate this to be reasonable.</P>
<P>I can easily perceive, that all who are well affected to the house of
Austria, try, by all means, to persuade the Pope, that the prince of
Orange is no enemy to the catholics; but only strives to maintain his
acquisition of the government of England. Monseigneur Caprara,
the other day, when I was to see him, told me, that he had acquainted
his holiness with my design to pay my duty to him; and that, although
the prince of Orange had obliged me not to go to France, he had allowed
me to come thither. I told Monsieur that it was not so; but that I
was banished absolutely. I might go to France if I would. The danger
flowed from a late act, not from any prohibition: that the prince of
Orange had no mind I should be here: that his love was no greater to
the Pope than to France. O! but, said he, you must not tell him so.
I told him I would; and that any, who had a mind to make him pass
for a friend to catholics, injured my master and the truth at once. O!
said he, but the old man seemed so glad, that you had leave to come
thither, and you must not contradict what seemed so acceptable to him.
I told him plainly I would undeceive him, and let him know how our
missionaries were banished (a matter which father Lesslie has handled too
nicely, as I have told him roundly enough; for I was forced to say, that
<PB N="533" REF="557"/>
no Jesuit in Britain would have done as he did); that the addresses
carried, that he had banished popery and tyranny, meaning a catholic
King for being catholic, and that he made it an instrument of support∣ting
his usurpation, his boasting of his being an enemy to popery; and
this I will do, although one told me indirectly, that, if I endeavour to
make the Emperor appear, as a favourer of heresy, I would draw a mis∣chief
on my head. But, by the grace of God, I'll fear no event, in the
pursuing of the King's interest, with my most zealous endeavours.</P>

<OPENER>Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> <DATE>7th June, 1695.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“I Said all I could think of before him [pope], that could move him to
have a true sense of the state of the King's sufferings; demonstrating,
that no earthly power could have hurt the King, save by the concurrence
of catholic princes, and not they neither, if the King had been of the
religion of his dominions. This he seemed firmly to believe, and
called the King a saint. This being so, then, I said, that all that his
Holiness could do for him was but too little: that there was now in
Rome a great talking of peace, and upon such terms, as if consented to,
or even permitted, would be a stain upon his Holiness's reputation, and
a reflection upon the apostolique chair. He said it was true. But what
can we do? I have done and will do, what, humanly speaking, is pos∣sible:
but catholic princes will not hearken to me; they have lost the
respect that used to be paid to popes: religion is gone, and a wicked
policy set up in its place. But, I said, that he could still prevent a peace
with the King's exclusion in it. God knows, he said, to restore the
King, I would give my blood; but Christians have lost all respect, even
to us; to us! said he. But can it be believed, continued his Holiness,
that I should ever consent to any peace, that excludes that good King
from his just right. God forbid! God forbid! But what will become
of all this? The prince of Orange is master: he is arbiter of Europe.
The Europeans and King of Spain are slaves, and worse than subjects to
him. They neither will nor dare venture to displease him; and here he
struck twice with his hand upon the table, and sighed. If God, (said he),
by some stroke of omnipotency, do it not, we are undone. I pressed

him to reflect, that this was really a war of religion. He said, that they
were blind who did not see that. Last of all, I laid before him the piti∣ful
case of the poor catholics, who, having followed their master,
were now reduced to extreme misery. God help them! said he; but
what can I do? If I should do any thing, I am cryed out upon, as
favouring France, who are pushing to be masters of all. However, he
said, he was convinced, that all I said was most reasonable, and that
he would think upon it. In the mean time, I am very confident he will
never consent, or even wink at any peace, by which his Majesty may
suffer in his just rights; and this is one great point; and for the money
part of it, I hope, with him, we may obtain somewhat. Meanwhile, I
fancy nobody has spoke directly to his Holiness of any truce,”</P>

<P>I Doubt not, but you will find there [at Rome] all the outward civi∣lities,
that you can expect, both from his Holiness and from the
cardinals: but to get any money from him to supply the great necessitys
of his Majestie's suffering subjects, for their loyalty and religion, I fear
will be a difficult, if not impossible task; and yet to satisfy those that
are in want, at lead, of his Majestie's endeavours for them, it shall be
attempted in the proper season, when you shall judge his Holiness best
prepared to receive an address of that nature. But, before any thing of
that be done, his Holiness ought to be made sensible of his Majestie's de∣votion
to the see apostolick, and how much he has suffered for it: that
any general peace, that shall exclude the King and own the usurper,
will, in every respect, be like that between Herod and Pilate: That,
who endeavours it, or contributes towards it, upon these terms, is a be∣trayer
of the catholic religion, and makes a sacrifice of it to worldly
interest: that, as the church is built upon a rock, so the piety and zeal
of his Holiness, for the house of God, ought to stand firm against all
human respects and politick insinuations to the contrary. I fear his
Holiness stands a little in need of such representations as these to be
warmly made to him, in regard of the violent inclination he has to pro∣cure
a peace in Europe, at any rate; that he may be freed from the fear
<PB N="535" REF="561"/>
of the Germans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> who are at his door, and also of the confederate fleet,
in the Mediterranean: So that we have nothing but conscience to plead
with him against interest, nor will he want false directors to tell him,
that a part must be sacrificed to save the whole; that Europe must be
preserved by making peace, and England left to the providence of God;
forgetting, that what is unjust and irreligious in itself ought not to be
done to save the whole world.</P>

<DATE>July 4, 1695.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR lordship's of the 6th and 7th of June are happily arrived;
giving, in the first place, a very natural account of the temper and
disposition of the court of Rome, where, as your lordship very well ob∣serves,
interest does not reign, but tyrannize, and truly it requires a virtue
no less consummated and try'd than our masters; and give me leave also
to add, your lordship's not to be scandalized, at so much of the scribe
and pharisee so near the chair of Moses. In the mean time, it is no small
comfort to every true Christian to find, that his Holiness himself, of all
the court of Rome, is the least tainted with that corrupt policy, which
makes a sacrifice of justice and even of religion to wordly interest.
But these sages at Rome, as clear sighted as they think themselves to be,
will shortly find how much they are mistaken, in their calculation of
affairs. For I dare affirm to your lordship, upon very certain grounds,
<PB N="536" REF="562"/>
that this confederacy cannot hold two years to an end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and that the
King of France has it now in his power, to be once more the arbiter of
the peace of Europe. To make this evident, I need only shew, that
England, the main support of the league, cannot possibly any longer bear
the weight; and that this summer's campaign, by land and by sea, is
the last effort, which our nation can or will make, because their present
aversion to the government of the prince of Orange is as great as the
necessity and want of money, which that government has brought them
to; and to confirm all this, I send you here, an authentic account of the
present state of England, together with a copy of the letter, which ac∣companied
it, writ to me by the bishop of Norwich; which I desire your
lordship to shew to nobody, except cardinal Janson, but to make what
use you shall think best of it.</P>
<P>His Holiness needs not be discouraged, at the unjust reproaches of
the Austrians, stiling him a partizan of France, because he will not make
one with them, in a league with heretics. For he will have very shortly
the satisfaction to fee the Divine Providence no less in the French in∣terest,
than himself; and that scandalous league, thought so invincible at
Rome, suddenly fall to the ground. I confess, I cannot be but astonish∣ed
at the maxims of the good assistant of Germany at the Gjesu, who
will have every thing to be lawful and holy, which the Emperor does.
But I would fain know of that conscientious divine, if Teckeli should
make himself King of Hungary, and dispossess the Emperor of all his
other dominions, what he would think of any English Jesuit, that should
maintain, that for the sake of peace, Tekeli, though a Calvinist, ought
to be let continue in his usurpation; and yet the other catholic princes
must insist upon any treaty of peace, to have him so continued? Let
those directors of conscience look to it, and look to themselves; for a
day of reckoning will come, when a wilful mistake, or an affected igno∣rance
of matters of fact will not serve their turn. But I hope, before that
time, God will mercifully open their eyes and touch their hearts, that
they may see and repent. The auspicious entrance, which your lordship
made, in your first audience with his Holiness, very much leads there-unto;
and, to say the truth, you have already, in a manner, finished a
work, which was of the greatest importance to his Majesty's concerns,
in leaving a true idea of his Majesty's case in his Holiness's mind; and,
<PB N="537" REF="563"/>
consequent thereunto, a resolution in him never to abandon his interest,
nor consent to a peace prejudicial thereunto.</P>
<P>There seems nothing more to remain for your lordship to do, but to
preserve and confirm, in his Holiness, these his just and pious sentiments
towards his Majesty, to whom I must leave it, to let you know, under
his own hand, how acceptable to him the service is, which you have
now done him with his Holiness, which you may expect the next post;
for he and the Queen are, at present, both absent from St. Germains,
but will return this night, having spent four or five days severally in a
ramble of devotion, the King at La Trappe and the Queen at Chaliot.
The prince and princess are in perfect health, and grow up to the won∣der
of every body.</P>

business, will oblige me to add no more to what I have above written;

The truth of the matter is, that all the world crys out for it, and no

above, we are likely to be made the sacrifice of it. However, I know,
that what your lordship has received from the mouth of his Holiness, that
he will have no hand in the wrong shall be done his Majesty, will be of

thrive, until we be in a better condition in the world; for it is not
what is due to his Majesty, as rightfully King of his Majestie's domi∣nions,
or as having lost the possession of them for the catholic faith; but
what his friendship can import to Rome, that is the measure of the fa∣vour
of this court.”</P>
<P>September the 27th. “The confederates confess, that, had the prince
of Orange been driven from before Namur, they would have aban∣doned
him; but now he is saviour, protector, and idol; all the heros of
antiquity are but his precursors; and, to triumph over the King of
France's foresight and counsel, and over the Mareschals of Villeroy and
Busslers, is so great a support to his reputation, that all here con∣clude,
that he will unite the league (if a peace be not struck up very soon)
and get from England to their bodkins and thimbles. Now all our
conversations are bringing the King to Rome, which God forbid, and
establishing the prince of Orange in England for all his life, be it long
or short; and some, who appeared very fixed, begin to say, that the
prince of Orange must be a great man, who never gives over but pushes
on, though repelled again and again, and that, at last, such a one must
accomplish his designs, which is to humble the King of France, and to
transfer all the glory of this King's fortunate reign to himself, by re∣ducing
him to his own terms. But, upon the other hand, both the
emperor's people and the Spaniards here, begin to look about them.
They see, that the prince of Orange is absolute master in their parts of
the low countries: he is so too in Holland. If the King of Spain dies,

October 3d, 1695. Mr. Caryll writes to the earl of Perth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.—Nov.</NOTE>“Your

violently the Italians are bent for a peace, upon any terms, without
any consideration of us. I must not conceal it from your lordship,
though it be a last secret, and only fit for your breast, that the mi∣nisters
here are not one jot behind them in that point. They long and
labour underhand incessantly for it; nor will our concerns be any re∣mora
to the conclusion of it, whenever a formal treaty is set on foot.
According to <HI>Ragione de Stato,</HI> it cannot be expected, that they, who
offer Strasburg, Luxemburg, and whole countries besides, to purchase a
peace, should stick at giving up us into the bargain.”—“The great
affair of gaining a declaration from his Holiness, that he never will con∣cur
in any peace that excludes his Majesty from his just right, was
wholly reserved to your lordship, and has accordingly been happily ef∣fected
by you, though much apprehended by some, as very difficult to be
obtained, than which nothing could be of more comfort to their Majes∣ties;

they shall have no reason, at lead, to complain of the unkindness of their
holy father, to whom they owe obedience and respect.”</P>
<P>November 7th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. ii. 410 No. 36.</NOTE> 1695, Lord Perth writes: “Get me a sure account
of what is doing in relation to hinder the children of Catholics from being
bred up in the Catholic religion; and you would furnish me with a new
occasion of stirring up his Holiness to mind the conservation of that little
remnant of truth that rests amongst us. We hear they have begun with
Ireland, by hindering, by act of parliament, the breeding up of children
beyond sea. This is understood; for, by your law, no schools for Ca∣tholics
are at home. Now, if this were done in England likewise, what
may we hope for as to the preservation of religion; and still Rome is
silent, and lets all go to ruin?”</P>
<P>On the 21st, he writes—“You may believe, that this court will stand
by his Majesty, as far as ever they dare; but (as the Pope often tells me)
Orange is master of the world, and commands all the Catholic princes
like slaves: but he still adds, that, by God's grace, he will let all the

<P>A Mistake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1696. January.</NOTE> in a conversation between Lewis XIV. and the late King,
defeated the invasion, intended for this year. Mr. Powel, who had
been sent, by the adherents of the latter prince, from England, through the
vehemence of his zeal, produced this mistake. He seemed to insinuate,
that the Jacobites in Britain were first to take arms, and then expected
to be supported by France, On this state of the case, his most Christian
Majesty proceeded to make preparations, for transporting a force into
England. The orders given were so well obeyed, that things were in
great forwardness, in the beginning of the year. James, therefore, and
his servants employed themselves in forming plans for an invasion. The
following is a scheme for a descent in the neighbourhood of Newcastle.</P>

<P>“THE town of Newcastle, one of the most considerable in England, is
situated at the distance of a league from the sea, on the river Tyne,
which separates the county of Northumberland from the bishoprick of
Durham. At the mouth of this river stands a large village, called Tin∣mouth,
with a fort, which commands the entry. But it is in bad repair
towards the land. Vessels of 500 tons can enter the harbour.</P>
<P>The town is surrounded only by an old ruinous wall, without ram∣parts
or ditches; and is commanded by heights, on all sides. It is in this
neighbourhood they dig the coals, which are so well known throughout
all Europe, and without which the city, of London could not subsist.
This might cause a terrible desolation in that town, and consequently an
extreme disorder throughout all the kingdom, as coals are shipped only
from thence, and from Sunderland, a small town at three leagues dis∣tance,
<PB N="542" REF="570"/>
which is scarcely known, but by the nobleman, who takes his
title from it.</P>
<P>From London to Newcastle, there are seventy leagues of as fine a
country as is in the world; fifteen from Newcastle to Scotland; and
twenty to Lancaster. In the counties of York, Westmoreland, Cumber∣land,
Northumberland, and in the bishoprick of Durham, are all the
excellent studs; consequently the cavalry and dragoons might be easily
mounted. Besides, 20,000 carriage and cart horses, which carry coals
from the mines to Newcastle and Sunderland, will be found in that coun∣try,
and may be useful for carrying the baggage of the army. But a more
important consideration is, that the greatest part of the inhabitants of
these districts are well affected towards his Majesty, and may join him
without any hinderance. The length of the navigation is the only ob∣jection
that can be foreseen; to which it may be answered, that the dif∣ficulty
consists in failing from Dunkirk and leaving the coast; but that
ships, when they are once at sea, have nothing to fear, and it is immate∣rial
whether the descent is made on the second or on the fourth day. It
is proper to remark, that the favourable wind for this passage is the S.
and S. E. which will hinder the ships in the Downs from putting to sea.”</P>

<P>“WE are much divided here, in Holland [France], about the
Scottish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st India Company; nor can we well see how
that matter can be settled, without a dispensing power, in a case where
people's properties are concerned, which was never yet pretended to; nor
is it credible, that the Scotch can be hectored into such a servile com∣pliance,
as to sacrifice their most undoubted right, manifest interest, and
boasted independence.—I must needs tell you a story, which I had from
a factor of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast India Company, when they had the news in India of
the revolution in England. The general of Batavia sent an ambassador
to the Mogul, who, among other things, told him, that they had drove
away the English King, and sent a servant of theirs to rule that people;
to which old Aurengzebe replied, That he was glad of it: that the Eng∣lish
<PB N="543" REF="571"/>
had wickedly defrauded his subjects of what was justly due to them;
and, against the public faith, had plundered them at sea; and, now,
that they had subdued them, he expected they should make him repara∣tion.
Depend on it, this story is seriously true<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was upon this occasion, that an envoy from the English company is said to have claimed a precedence over the Dutch envoy, alleging that he was the servant of a great King, like the Emperor himself, and ought to be heard before the representative of a par∣cel of merchants. The representation had some weight with Aurengzebe, till the Dutch∣man made this reply: “It is true, he is the servant of a great King, but that great King is one of our merchants. The English could not carry on their own business, and, therefore, we sent one of our factors, to command them and settle their accounts.” This mercan∣tile inference, says tradition, settled the point of precedence, for that time, in favour of the Dutchman.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The earl of Middleton wrote several letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> in the course of this and
the ensuing month to Chapman, Syson, Ward [Sackville], Clelland
[Waugh], and Green [Sir Andrew Forrester], giving them hopes of an
immediate invasion. In one of his letters to Chapman, dated the 24th
of January, he speaks of Powel's journey to France. “I am not sorry,
that Mr. Powel thinks of visiting us: for he will be quickly undeceived,
in what you suspect; and be able to set all matters in a true light, at his
return, if his sincerity is equal to his capacity.”</P>
<P>On the 26th of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> he writes to Ward. “Mr. Smith
[K. James] bid me tell you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> that his partner [Fr. King] has the mo∣ney
ready; but that he will not pay it, till the company [the adherents
of James] has taken up the goods No. 953 [arms]; and, upon the first
notice of it [insurrection], he will immediately dispatch away Mr. Smith
[K. James] to conclude the bargain. Pray let us know your opinion
of this matter; for as it is important, so it requires haste; and, if this
opportunity be lost, it may prove fatal to the company.”</P>
<P>The King of France insisted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> that James's friends, in England, should
take arms, before the French troops embarked. The following letter,
from lord Middleton to his correspondent Syson, relates to this circum∣stance.
It is dated the 26th February.</P>
<P>“This is only to acknowledge the favour of yours of the 5th instant,
since it will not be necessary to repeat what you have from the best hand.
<PB N="544" REF="572"/>
Besides that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> old Watt Freeman [probably D. of Berwick] must have
seen you before this comes to you. He can best inform you, though,
perhaps, not satisfy you: for there is one of the marriage articles which
appears very difficult to perform; and, though something ought to be
ventured, yet what is altogether unreasonable ought to be considered as
impossible; but of this you can only judge.”</P>
<P>Mr. Charnock, in May 1695, and lord Ailesbury, soon after, were
sent to Fiance to persuade James to invade England the next winter,
with a French army, and to acquaint him with the insurrections then in∣tended
in different parts of the kingdom. The duke of Berwick came
over, in the beginning of this year, to concert a plan of operations with
his friends, and to head the insurgents. James left St. Germains before
the return of his son. He met him however at Clermont, and carried
him back to Calais. Having 20,000 men under his direction in that
neighbourhood and near Dunkirk, he drew up a declaration, in which
he conceals that diffidence of success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D N. vol. i. fol. No. 132.</NOTE> which Middleton betrays, in the pre∣ceding
correspondence. For the intrigues of Charnock, Sir George Bar∣clay,
Sir William Perkins, captain Porter, and others, were not yet dis∣covered
in England. The declaration, however, was not published,
for the reasons mentioned by the earl of Middleton, in the following
letter.</P>

<P>“THE King has commanded me to tell you, that he finds many diffi∣culties
in the manifest proposed by the court of France, for the same
objections he against publishing it, as the declaration; for to say more
cannot be intended; to say less, is against his interest; and to come just
up to it, is the same thing, only with a new name. To say only, that
he was invited, by a great part of the nation, can be of no advantage to
his Majesty; but, on the contrary, a great prejudice to his assairs, by
raising the persecution higher against his friends, who may thereby be
put out of a condition of serving him; and it would be a plain proof,
that there was a plot, though not such a one as is pretended, which may
beget abjurations and greater penalties on non-swearers. But, perhaps,
the proposition may be mistaken; and, in that case, the surest and shortest

that they may be read in council: and, because that court may be
alarmed at the proceedings in England, it may be fit, in another paper,

there is one acknowledged King, the common style must be observed;

to be sent by him to his Holiness.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“AS his Holiness has always given conspicuous proofs of his justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE>
and of his zeal for the good of the church, it will be unnecessary
<PB N="552" REF="580"/>
to employ arguments to persuade him of the iniquity of the prince of
Orange;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> nor to excite him to embrace, with warmth, the interests of
his Britannic Majesty.</P>
<P>One cannot see, without astonishment, so many catholic princes in a
league to strengthen the enemies of their holy r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligion; his mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Chris∣tian
Majesty having alone supported that cause, and, by his generosity,
which will render his glory immortal, protected his Britannic Majesty,
who is oppressed by a violence and barbarity which disgrace the name
of Christians.</P>
<P>The two crowns of the North are in a profound peace; and the
princes of Germany are powerfully armed, while the Catholics are ruined;
and the church was never threatened with so much danger as it is now
since Julian the Apostate. It is not, therefore, doubted but his Holiness
will think himself obliged to employ vigorously all the power with which
God hath invested him, in order to withdraw the Catholics from such
pernicious engagements, by representing to them, in the most lively co∣lours,
what they owe to religion; that their salvation is at stake; that
they should not persist in rendering themselves accomplices in the in∣justice
of the prince of Orange, by supporting his usurpation, and by
rendering him the arbiter of all their concerns; and that they cannot
expiate their faults, but by contributing to the re-establishment of his
Britannic Majesty.</P>
<P>But if, to punish them, God abandons them to their blindness, and
that the state to which Europe is reduced will oblige it to conclude a
peace, without doing justice to his Britannic Majesty, he hopes that his
Holiness will not allow himself to be surprised by the artful expedients
which the mediators may propose; as his Britannic Majesty will never
consent that his incontestible right should be called in question.</P>
<P>For instance, it cannot be denied but, by receiving a pension from
the prince of Orange, though there were never so much cause for it,
his Britannic Majesty would tacitly renounce his right; and if he con∣sented
that, after the death of the prince of Orange, his royal highness
the prince of Wales, his son, reigned in his life-time, that would be a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormal renounciation; and the prince of Orange could only promise a
<PB N="553" REF="581"/>
thing which he is not able to perform; because the parliament, who
conferred the royal authority on him, settled the reversion of the crown on
the princess Anne of Denmark. But, supposing further, that the prince
of Orange could and would oblige the English to revoke that settlement,
it would be always on condition of bringing over the prince of Wales
into England, without their being able to give any security for his con∣science
or his person; and it is firmly believed, that his Holiness will
never give his advice or consent to a measure which may have such fatal
consequences.</P>
<P>The prince of Wales, by succeeding to the prince of Orange, yields
his sole right, which is that of his father; and, being obliged to the
people for his elevation, would not reign, but during their pleasure;
and, if his Britannic Majesty was capable of consenting to so disgraceful
a proposal, he might be justly reproached with ruining the monarchy,
which has been always hereditary, by rendering it elective, and with sa∣crificing
to an enemy all that is most dear to him.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, his Majesty has so much regard and affection for his
loyal subjects, that, when a treaty of peace is begun, he intreats his
Holiness to endeavour to make some stipulation in their favour, which
may protect them against the cruel persecutions they have suffered in the
time past, and which may restore them to their estates; and that, at
least, they may be at liberty to return home in safety, without being
obliged to enter into illegal engagements; and that those who, accord∣ing
to their duty, would attach themselves to his service for the future,
may not be treated as criminals.</P>
<P>By attentions so just and so generous, his Holiness will secure the re∣verence
of posterity to his pontificate; and, by acquitting himself of his
duty towards God, will be able to give a good account of his ministry.”</P>

<DIV3>
<P>In the memorial mentioned in the preceding letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> James addresses
himself to his Electoral Highness, in the same strain in which he ad∣dressed
the Nuncio. He upbraids the catholic princes for supporting a
heretic in his usurpation; and makes use of the same casuistry he had em∣ployed
<PB N="555" REF="583"/>
in his memorial to the Nuncio, against leaving King William in
peaceable possession during his life, and securing the succession to the
prince of Wales.</P>
<P>After the execution of the conspirators in England, James found it
difficult, upon his return to St. Germains, to renew a correspondence
with Britain. The first attempt towards it is mentioned in a letter from
the earl of Middleton to Mr. Nowell, on the 30th of June.</P>
<P>“I Was very glad to find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> by your letter, that you were in safety.
His Majesty approves of what you have done, and proposed for
his service; and would have you give him an account of the persons
designed to carry the pacquets to and from the water-side, and what is
to be given to each person respectively who are to be concerned in the
management of this affair.”</P>
<P>On the 4th of August, he wrote to Mr. Pigault, merchant at Calais.
“I desire the favour of you, that you would let me know the parti∣culars
of what you proposed for restoring our correspondence in Eng∣land:
as for instance, the place on the other side, the name of the per∣son
who is to receive and carry the pacquet to London and bring it back
from thence. Pray present my service to monsieur le president, and
concert this matter with him.”</P>
<P>On the 13th of August, he wrote again to Mr. Nowell. “The King
has commanded me to acquaint you, that since he cannot, at present, set
up the correspondence, he is willing to allow you five hundred livres
a-year to remain at Calais, that you may make the best interest you can
among the sailors; and procure him, by that means, the best intelligence
you are able, that, when occasion offers for his service, you may be in
readiness.” It seems Middleton suspected Nowell; for he wanted ano∣ther
to act in his place, as appears by a letter he wrote of the same date
to monsieur Bretagne. “The great difficulty,” says he, “we find in
setting up our correspondence, is the want of a person, such as we had
before, to take care to deliver what is sent. If you can help us in this,
you will oblige.” He likewise cautions Mr. Pigault, in two different
letters, against a Mr. Griffith, “who seems to be very busy in this mat∣ter
of the correspondence, without any warrant from the King their mas∣ter;
<PB N="556" REF="584"/>
and the general rule, in such cases, is never to believe, without
seeing something in writing from his Majesty, or by his order.”</P>

others; and having landed with eighteen men, after having broke
open the door of the house, notwithstanding the resistance of Hunt,
who fired a pistol at him, he carried him away by force, and brought
him to Calais.”</P>
<P>It was universally believed, that all Europe was now on the eve of
a general peace; and James, who began to despair of his own restoration,
was desirous of making some stipulations in favour of his Queen and
of his adherents. The two following memorials relate to this subject.
They are in Nairne's hand.</P>

<P>ACcording to the most ancient laws and customs of England, which

their revenue, who depended entirely on them, and all their acts have
<PB N="558" REF="586"/>
been valid, without the consent or concurrence of the Kings their
husbands.</P>
<P>As the Queen of England brought a very considerable sum, as her por∣tion
at her marriage, the King, her husband, on his accession to the crown,
thought it was reasonable for him to make an establishment of fifty
thousand pounds sterling, of an annual revenue, on her, which was passed
under the great seal of England, and afterwards, for the greater security,
was confirmed by acts of parliament, which have not been repealed to this
day; insomuch, that the Queen has an incontestible right to all the ar∣rears
of this revenue, which are due since she left England, as well as
to those which shall be due hereafter.</P>
<P>Her Majesty only asks this, simply and purely, as a private debt, which
is incontestibly due to herself; and of which she only sets forth a state,
lest it should be unknown to those who have the power and the will to
do her justice.”</P>

<P>AS all Sovereigns ought to consider the cause of his Britannick Ma∣jesty
as their own, one must believe, that justice and reason will
inspire them with the design of bringing about his restoration.</P>
<P>But if, to punish England, God leaves it to complain, some time
longer, under the yoke of an usurped dominion, we are persuaded, that
all Christian princes will concur unanimously, in protecting, from the
sury of their enemies, men of honour, who have acted from no other
motives, than those of duty and of conscience; and the catholic princes
are most interested in providing for the safety of those poor catholics,
who are most exposed, on account of their religion, to the malice of
their enemies, who may resume and complete the design they had formed
and commenced, 18 years ago, to ruin all the catholics. We have seen
a great deal of innocent blood shed, on pretence of crimes of state, and
upon the false testimonies of some villains.</P>
<P>It is therefore proposed to these princes, to send orders to their pleni∣potentiaries,
to stipulate, in the treaty of peace, an indemnity to all his
<PB N="559" REF="587"/>
Britannick Majestie's subjects, for all they have done for his service; and
to obtain, that all the sentences passed against them may be reversed,
and each of them restored to his estate.</P>
<P>And, as it is absolutely necessary, for his Britannick Majesty to be
attended by his own subjects, it is proposed to stipulate also in this
treaty, that those who now attend him, may be allowed to remain, with∣out
being liable to be called to account for it afterwards.</P>
<P>Examples of such indemnities are not wanting, in most of the trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es

<P>THE late King was greatly alarmed, at the earnest desire, which all
the belligerent powers now discovered to conclude a general peace.
He endeavoured, in vain, to dissuade the King of France from it; and
was obliged to content himself, with asking some stipulations for his
Queen and his adherents. There is a memorial on the subject which
has no date, but which appears to have been addressed to the French
ministry, during the congress at Ryswick.</P>
<P>JAMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 138.</NOTE> in this memorial, endeavours to show, that France can derive
no security from a peace, if the prince of Orange shall be permitted
to establish himself in his usurpation: that he hath been always unsuc∣cessful
in war; but, that he has never failed, by his intrigues, in time
of peace, to stir up all Europe against France; and would continue to do
so, while he was allowed to govern England and Holland. “It is but
too evident, that all Europe are now in the same dispositions towards the
French, in which they were formerly towards the Spaniards. They
would, undoubtedly, wish to see them humbled; and it is not to be
wondered, that the greatest part of the English, from a jealousy, which
is usual among neighbours, should be of the same sentiments. But it
ought to be remarked, that a King of England, who is a catholic, whose
subjects ate protestants, will always have occasion for the friendship of
France, in order to maintain his authority, and defend himself from the
insults of his own subjects, of which he will be in continual danger, on
account of their inveterate aversion to whatever they call popery.”</P>
<P>From these and several other reasons, James infers, that any kind of
peace with the prince of Orange, would be to France, “but a fire
<PB N="561" REF="589"/>
covered with ashes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE>” But that a peace would be both advantageous and
permanent, if he was once re-established on his throne. He repeats,
in the remaining part of the memorial, reasons, which he had often
mentioned, for invading Britain. The same things, with some exagger∣ations
of the present distresses of England and Holland, are differently
expressed and enlarged upon, in another memorial. It is in Nairne's
hand, and marked at the top, “Mr. Caryll, 1697.”</P>
<P>Middleton's letters to the French ministry and to the abbé Renaudot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, vol. i. 4to. No. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
at this time, are full of similar representations: they contain likewise an
account of two memorials for James; one to the catholic princes en∣gaged
in the confederacy, and another to the protestant princes and states.
Both were written by Renaudot, and were printed at the time. It ap∣pears
that the first, entituled, “A summary Memorial; containing the
reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. D. N. vol. ii. 410. No. 33 &amp; 34.</NOTE> which oblige the confederated catholic princes to contribute to
the re-establishment of his Britannic Majesty,” was sent by the marquis
de Torcy to Rome, from which it was returned with his Holiness's sanc∣tion
and emendations. The second, “containing the reasons, which
should oblige the protestant princes and states to contribute to the re∣establishment
of his Britannic Majesty,” was published, as soon as ap∣proved
of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> by the marquis de Torcy himself. Middleton in one of his
letters to Renaudot, about these memorials, and the protestation which
James intended to publish against a peace, desires him to answer, one of
“Burnet's libels.”</P>
<P>Though James was, at the time, accused by his enemies of abetting
plots for assassinating King William, it now appears, that he never har∣boured
any such design. The following may serve as an additional
proof of the innocence of that unfortunate prince, upon that head.</P>

<P>THERE is an Englishman arrived here, who calls himself Vane,

and, as I rejected this proposal, with aversion, the conversation
finished. But when I gave an account of it to the King, my master,
lest the man should make his escape, he spoke to the count de Druis, to
secure his person, until the King's orders about him should be received.
It is for this reason, the King of England desires you to inform his Ma∣jesty

<P>4thly, You must regularly, twice a week, give an account to one of
his Majesty's secretaries of state, of all matters that come to your know∣ledge,
<PB N="563" REF="591"/>
either concerning his Majesty's own affairs, or the treaty of peace,
in general.</P>
<P>5thly, The affairs of his Majesty, which you are to treat upon, with
Monsieur de Croissy or the other plenipotentiaries of France, are
this: first, her Majesty's appanage, for the doing of which, you are re∣ferred
to the paper concerning it, already sent to the plenipotentiary, of
which you may carry along with you a copy. Now, in case the prince
of Orange's agents, should deny or question any matters of fact, as they
are set down in that paper, which so plainly prove the queen's right,
even according to their own present law, you must aver, that both your
patent under the broad seal and the act of parliament, which settle and
confirm that estate upon the Queen, during her life, are upon record
in the registers of the crown-office and of the parliament, to which we
appeal: and that the Queens of England, independently of the King,
have a right to their estates so settled upon them, the plenipotentiaries
of the prince of Orange themselves, cannot be so ignorant or so wilful,
as to deny. Though her Majesty has an equal right to the arrears, which
being a just debt, ought to be paid upon demand, as well as to the rent,
which shall hence forward become due; yet, if the difficulty of paying
so great a sum, all at once, should frighten them from doing her justice
therein, a temperament may be proposed for paying the arrear by so
much a year, as shall be agreed upon, till the debt be all discharged.”</P>

<HEAD>Additional Instructions.</HEAD>
<P>“1st,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 44.</NOTE> IT is desired, that upon the conclusion of the peace, a general
indemnity may be obtained for all his Majesty's subjects, that have
been in his service, since the revolution, both as to their persons and
to their estates, since such amnesties never have been omitted or refused
in treaties of a general peace, in relation to forfeitures incurred, during
and by reason of the war, as may be seen by the Westphalia and Pyre∣nean
treaties, where even those, who had born arms against their lawful
sovereigns, were indemnified; and this is much more reasonable and
just, in the case of his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty's subjects, since all parties agree, that he
was their lawful king, when they first bore arms and followed him.</P>
<P><PB N="564" REF="592"/>
2dly, If this demand, though reasonable in itself, should meet with
difficulties not to be overcome, it is desired, at least, that such as are
domestic and menial servants to the King and to the Queen, may enjoy
such indemnity as is above mentioned. For, I believe, his greatest
enemies will not think it just and decent, that their Majesties should live
without servants, and without those of their own country, that have long
served them, which barbarity would be a necessary consequence, from
the refusing such indemnity; at least, the refusers thereof contribute,
as much as lies in them, to deprive their Majesties even of servants, by
making it so highly penal, to serve their persons even for those who have
been so long in their service.</P>
<P>3dly, But, should this demand also find an unreasonable and obstinate
opposition, which certainly would astonish the whole world, let it, at
least, be endeavoured, that, since her Majesty, in her own person, lyes
under no forfeiture or disability, even by any law made since the revo∣lution,
those servants that are of her family may not be treated as cri∣minals
of state, against whom no other guilt can be pretended or proved,
but serving their Queen and mistress, and not leaving her in her adver∣sity.
It will appear in the eyes of the world very strange, to make that
a crime so highly punishable, especially, since the prince Orange himself,
when he first came into England, gave leave and passports to the Queen's
servants to follow her Majesty into France; and, for their so doing and for
nothing else, they have been indicted of high treason, upon a general ac∣cusation
of adhering to the King's enemies; nothing else being sworn
against them, at the finding of the bill, but that they were at St.
Germains; and for not coming out of France into England and appear∣ing
to answer the indictment, within the time limited, they were out∣lawed;
though, at the same time, there was a law in being, which did
prohibit, under the severest penalties, all passing out of France into
England.”</P>

<P>“AS his most Christian Majesty has been pleased to obtain, by his
mediation, a promise from the prince of Orange, that the Queen
of England shall be paid what is due to her, we are persuaded, that his
Majesty will be sorry that she should be deprived of it; and, as we have
too much reason to distrust the prince of Orange's sincerity, it will not
be difficult for him to invent quirks for eluding his promise. For in∣stance,
if the Queen is desired to sign the discharges, they may be drawn
up in such a form, that she will not and cannot sign them.</P>
<P>Again, if officers named by the Queen, are put in possession of her
estates, and if the tenants and others refuse to pay, they cannot be forced
but in a court of justice; and the Queen will neither plead before their
courts nor acknowledge them, Besides that, the prince of Orange
might think himself freed from his promise, when he pleased, from a
pretence, that the money was employed against him.</P>
<P>So that there is no expedient, but that the prince of Orange should
oblige himself, by a secret article, to pay the sum mentioned to his most
Christian Majesty and his successors, during the life of the Queen. If
the prince of Orange acts sincerely, he will accept this proposal. If it
is rejected, the affair, in all likelihood, will be of no consequence;
and yet there is no doubt, but his most Christian Majesty is very careful
to put on a solid foundation, a thing so honourable to himself and neces∣sary
to the Queen of England.”</P>

<P>“1st, IT is desired, that my lord Rochester and my lord Godolphin,
who are the commissioners named, by the letters patent and the
act of parliament, impowering them to receive the revenue of the
<PB N="566" REF="594"/>

their trust, as being the persons who can give legal discharges for what
they receive.</P>
<P>2dly, That, since it becomes payable, at least since the time it has
been promised at Ryswick, and since, according to the first settlement
it should be paid at quarterly terms, of which Christmas is one, it is
desired that the first quarterly payment should be made Christmas next.</P>
<P>3dly, That, in case they fail to pay punctually every quarter as it be∣come
due, it is desired application should be made to the prince of
Orange for redress, by the ambassador of his most Christian Majesty.</P>
<P>4thly, As to the interests of Catholics in general, it is desired, that
the ambassador may advise with bishop Leyborn, concerning what may
be most expedient for their relief and protection; that bishop being a
person of great prudence and experience, and knowing well that, at this
time, the interests of France and of religion are the same.</P>
<P>5thly, It would be agreeable that endeavours should be made to
obtain a suspension of the penal laws against Catholics, as well in Scot∣land
and in Ireland, as in England, where they have shewn some sort of
moderation for some years. But in Scotland, their laws are executed
with rigour, by imprisoning and banishing all priests, merely because
they are priests; and in Ireland, the great severity of the new laws passed
there, gives reason to fear the same rigour in their execution.</P>
<P>6thly, Also all the King's friends who are ordinarily called Jacobites,
are recommended to the ambassador's protection, left they should be
oppressed merely for having been loyal to their Sovereign, while they
live peaceably, without giving any offence to the present government.</P>
<P>7thly, It is further desired, that the public faith engaged in the capi∣tulation
of the city of Limerick, should be maintained in all its articles;
and that all who were without the town, as well as those who were
within, and laid down their arms upon the faith of these articles, should
be allowed to enjoy their fortunes, according to the said capitulation.</P>

the sufferings of the dutiful among the most sensible of our aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic∣tions;
and we had nothing more in view by our constant endeavours to
recover our right, than to have rewarded those who had contributed
to it.</P>
<P>The misfortune that happened to the French fleet at La Hogue in
1692, made such an impression on that court, that ever since, the dif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ulty
of transporting a considerable force was thought to be insuperable;
and, therefore, from that time, applications were made to all the neu∣tral
nations to set a treaty of peace a foot, as may appear, by the date
of their memorials given to the northern crowns; and they were the more
solicitous in pursuing that design the year following, by reason of the
famine and mortality that happened in their country, which stopt even
the circulation of the money; so that nothing prevented the conclusion
of the peace then, but that there were still means left to support the
Prince of Orange's aversion to it, which we made use of, amongst other
arguments, to engage them to attempt our restoration, as being the
shortest way of obtaining an honourable and lasting peace. But the tide
turned. France recovered, and the confederacy declined; so that they
hoped to compass their purpose without venturing any thing. The con∣jecture
was so singularly unlucky, that our enemies' disadvantages advanced
this peace. Had Namur been relieved, we cannot doubt but it would
have been concluded the winter following; since we see, that the sepa∣rate
treaty with Savoy has produced that effect, which certainly gave the
French all the advantage imaginable over their enemies.</P>
<P>At last, when we were convinced that nothing could divert them from
their peaceable resolution, and that the treaty was actually begun by
M. de Calliere, our only care then was the preservation of our loyal
subjects; and, in order to that, in October, 1696, we insisted earnestly
that there might be an indemnity stipulated for all those who had ren∣dered
themselves obnoxious on our account: That all outlawries against
them might be reversed; and they restored to the full and quiet possession
of their estates.</P>
<P>This was frequently reiterated with all the proper arguments and un∣deniable
precedents, both to the French court and to that of Rome; that
by the last, it might be conveyed to all the catholic princes and states.
<PB N="571" REF="599"/>
It was proposed at Ryswick by the French, but rejected by the English.
The fear of embarassing their own treaty, and left the same favour might
be pressed for the Huguenots, were the reasons why it was not further
insisted on by the French.</P>
<P>We cannot suppose that any of our good subjects can harbour such dis∣respectful
thoughts of us as to imagine that we were consenting to this
peace. If any have such, we pity them, as the ravings of distempered
people; and, without doubt, will be set right by reading our prote∣station.</P>
<P>There is nothing we desire more than the quiet and safety of our good
subjects: But every man must consult himself in that point. If they do
what we cannot allow of, we would not have them think that they have
incurred our displeasure thereby. We can freely pardon what we cannot
approve. We cannot consent to the taking of an unlawful oath in con∣science;
besides, it would look like absolving them of their allegiance to
us, which might be interpreted an abdication. We have a sensible com∣passion
of the pressures they he under, and shall still depend on their ser∣vice,
when we have occasion for it.”</P>

and to recommend himself, at the expence of all those who came
over to France during the war; and, among the rest, lord Aylesbury
will undoubtedly be beheaded. Against so great an evil there is no re∣medy,

<P>The earl of Middleton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> in a letter to the marquis de Torcy, on the
19th, desires that the same precautions should be taken against a Mr.
Goodman, who had been an evidence against several in England; and,
particularly, had informed against the duke of Powis, who, however,
bribed him to retire to France. Goodman now seemed impatient to
return. Middleton suspected that his intention was to put himself under
the protection of the earl of Portland, when he arrived; and therefore,
in his master's name, desires he should be secured with Hunt. It ap∣pears,
from another letter to de Torcy, written some months later, that
Goodman was sent a prisoner to Dauphiny, where his wife, in a petition
to the Queen, desired to be imprisoned with him. Middleton, in the
meantime, endeavoured to renew his former correspondence with some
of his friends in England. There is a letter from him of the 16th of
February, to Clelland (Waugh) containing general expressions of kind∣ness
and regard. He was then greatly alarmed that some letters of con∣sequence
might be found about Mr. Crosby, who had been assassinated
in the streets of Paris. Crosby had carried on a correspondence, for
some time, with James's secret friends in England, and Middleton was

many in troubles, if they fell into improper hands.</P>

a congregation at Rome, complaining that the Catholic princes had con∣cluded
a peace, without making any stipulation for the distressed Catho∣lics
of Ireland, England, and Scotland, and without consulting the Holy
See. They intimated their suspicions, that the intrigues of the prince of
Orange extended to the court of Rome itself. They had undergone, they
said, a severe persecution for upwards of one hundred and seventy years.
They were now laughed at by the protestants, when they saw them aban∣doned
by those from whom they expected protection. They enumerated
the several laws which were enacted against them, and which must, in the
end, extirpate the Catholic religion. They humbly proposed to the
Pope to send legates to the courts of all the Catholic princes, in order
to persuade those princes to forbid all commerce with Great Britain, un∣til
the Catholics in the three kingdoms were freed from all restrictions in
the exercise of their religion.</P>

It does not appear, that his imperial Majesty, in consequence of

before he received it, he must have sent instructions to his envoy at
London; for the Pope's letter is dated the 21st of June, and the follow∣ing

<P>“ALTHOUGH I have not done myself the honour of writing to you
for some time, I have not, however, forgot my promise to ac∣quaint
you, when the opportunity offered, with every thing that hap∣pened
here concerning the affairs of Ireland. I don't doubt, but you
have been informed of the laws, which have been past during this session
of parliament, against the Catholics, and particularly against monks,
bishops, and all those who have any ecclesiastical dignity. And as his
imperial Majesty, my august master, has been informed of them, he has
been pleased to order me to speak about them to his Britannic Majesty.
I did not fail to do so, as well as I could, and to such purpose, that his
Majesty sent yesterday the chancellor of that kingdom to me, to tell me,
that it is true these laws were past, but that they would not be rigorously
executed: that all the monks would not be banished, although it was
almost impossible to tolerate them longer, on account of their great in∣solence,
and their little respect for the present government. Yet some of
them would be allowed to remain, particularly those, who, on account
of their great age, were incapable of leaving the kingdom. That all
the bishops and other ecclesiastical dignitaries would be allowed to re∣main;
and that the Catholics might have as many secular priests as
they pleased, in towns, as well as in villages and other places. As com∣plaints
were made, that the capitulation of Limerick was not kept, the
chancellor explained this to me in such a manner, that I don't see there
is any reason to complain. I was informed likewise, that the parliament
had passed a law, by which all the Catholics were obliged to educate
their children in the pretended reformed religion. But the truth is, that
they did not even think of such a law. The question now is, to
see that all, that hath been promised to me, shall be punctually per∣formed.
I shall take care of this. At the same time, the Catholics must
behave in such a way as will enable me to be of service to them. I was
willing to communicate this to you, in order to shew you, that no oppor∣tunity
<PB N="576" REF="604"/>
is neglected of maintaining our holy religion. I entreat you, most
humbly, to be persuaded, that I am, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>The court of Rome disputed with James the power of nominating
bishops in Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 410. No. 19, 21, 22, 23, 27.</NOTE> His agent, M. Caprara, presented two memorials,
on the subject, to the propaganda. The bishop of Limerick gave in his
objections; and James was obliged to defend himself in a long and laboured
reply. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of this prince, and his submis∣sive
obedience to the see of Rome in spirituals, it appears, that he never
intended to acknowledge the Pope's supremacy in temporal concerns.
The Irish bishops were sensible of this, and, though he had lost his
crowns for his attachment to their religion, they told him plainly that he
was under <HI>a sentence of excommunication;</HI> and that he must be publickly
absolved, before he could interfere in their affairs. Their reasonings to
prove this are no less curious, than the absurdity of their pretensions.
They are contained in the following paper, entituled,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“How to treat with the Pope.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 18.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>“WE must lay, for an undoubted foundation, that the Pope will do
nothing, but according to the canons.”</P>
<P>“Therefore, it is in vain to treat with the Pope, unless we resolve to be
guided by them.”</P>
<P>“It is certain, that England was heretofore excommunicated, according
to the canons; and the kingdom lies, at this day, under the excommu∣nication.”</P>
<P>“So, no Englishman can, by the canons, appear as a public person, in
name of the community, till the excommunication is taken off.”</P>
<P>“For, although many English Catholics are, by special privileges, ab∣solved
in particular; yet the absolution serves not to make them capable
to deal, as public persons, with his Holiness. But they must be pub∣lickly
absolved, amongst the rest.”</P>
<P>“Therefore, the public excommunication must be taken off, before the
kingdom can be capable of treating publickly with his Holiness; and it
is his Holiness alone that can take it off.”</P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="605"/>
“Which being so, the King ought to look upon the Pope as his superior,
and upon himself as a person not yet lawfully qualified to treat pub∣lickly
with his Holiness; who is, therefore, to be privately demanded
what the canons require should be done in this case, until the whole
kingdom may be disposed to receive a public solemn absolution.”</P>
<P>“In my judgment, this ought to have been done before the crown was
set upon his Majesty's head: and now, that very ceremony ought to be
brought into consideration, to the end that the subject may, for the fu∣ture,
live under a catholic crown.”</P>
<P>“No doubt, but the Pope will be forwarder to grant, than we to de∣mand,
as long as we keep within the bounds of the holy canons.”</P>
<P>“If we swerve from them, we cannot expect the Pope should be other∣wise
than hard, uneasy, inflexible.”</P>

<P>“YESTERDAY, the 16th of November, a porter came two or three
times in the morning, desiring very earnestly to speak to me. At
last, between 11 and 12, he brought me a note, which I sent to her Ma∣jesty
by Mr. Innes, the chaplain, who is acquainted with this affair. The
bearer of the note told me, that he had the strictest orders from the per∣son
who sent it, not to permit any other to see it.”</P>
<P>“I went immediately to the person, who had written the note to me. I
found him in a little dark room, in the publick-house called The prince
of Wales, and saw a young man, whom I recollected to have known, but
of whom I had a very imperfect remembrance. He told me, that his
name was Charras; that he was brother to the apothecary of the same
name, at St. Marget's-street, near the abbey of St. Germains, at Paris.
After some compliments, he told me, that he had an affair of great con∣sequence
to communicate to me, which required great secrecy: that he
had an expedient of rendering an essential service to the King, our mas∣ter:
that, although he was a stranger to his Majesty, he had an entire
affection for him: that he had always lamented the injustice which had
been done him: that he was determined to surmount all the difficulties
which might occur: that he had only two or three friends; and that
these were domestics of the prince of Orange's, but devoted to the inte∣rests
of King James: that a number of accomplices would render an en∣terprize
of that kind always hazardous; and that the last affair failed,
merely because too many were acquainted with it.”</P>
<P>“All his expressions indicated, that he cared little for his life, pro∣viding
the King might be restored. He enlarged upon the subject; and
was willing, I imagine, to discover to me the expedient, which he men∣tioned.
But I assured him, that the King, my master, had principles of
religion and honour, which would never permit him to countenance such
an attempt. This answer embarrassed and seemed to confound him; but,
recovering himself, he enlarged upon the recompense, which such an
heroic action would deserve; and observed, that, although he and his
<PB N="580" REF="608"/>
comrades should perish in the attempt, the action would be always rec∣koned
glorious, and that the advantages, which their relations might
derive from it, would be a sufficient recompense for the loss of their
lives.”</P>
<P>“He told me also, that he had communicated this affair to Mr. Innes,
which I now find to be false; and that Mr. Innes desired him to come
to me. He assured me also, at the same time, that he would make it
known to one or both of the secretaries of state. But, as soon as I came
home, I saw from the window of my room, that he left the inn, being
dissatisfied, as I imagine, with my answers; and concluded, that I would
make a discovery to the King and to both the secretaries of state; and I
have since learned, that he left St. Germains, though he told me, that
he would not, and that he had chosen that lodging, in order to be more
private, and that he would not see any body, until he had concerted this
affair, which he would easily do, without noise or danger. This is the
substance, and almost all the circumstances, of what he told me; and I
am ready to declare so upon oath, when called upon.”</P>

with one inclosed from the colonel; to which I give you the trouble
to give him the inclosed, for answer, which I should have done, by the
last post, but could not by reason of a meeting I had with some friends,
which took up all my time for that day. I am very sensible of that
gentleman's good intentions to do us all the good he can, and I believe he
will do me that justice to say, I was always so from the first day I had the
honour to know him; and, by what I say from Mr. Mons, he will see
how much he thinks he is obliged to him. If you have received all
mine of the 3d instant, you will perfectly see, that John Murey [the
King] does not intend that words, but deeds, should convince both his
friends and his enemies: for, as he reserves nothing in his own power, they
have nobody but themselves to blame, if every thing be not done to their
contentment; and, if that cannot do, you know the proverb, “You can
have no more of the cat but the skin.” However, if there be any thing
to be expected from his creditors [the people], he is very desirous to give
a meeting to any one, that will come from them, and he does not doubt,
but to give them all the satisfaction they can expect; and if the thing be
rightly understood, they must see the great advantages, that is upon their
side. Whereas, he has nothing before his eyes, but to have every thing,
by arbitrement of the arbitrators [parliament], disposed of to the best ad∣vantage
of his creditors [people]; and nobody can imagine, but the
longer it is delayed, the greater will be their loss. For, if the sale of
<PB N="583" REF="611"/>
lands [succession] be neglected, you will allow the loss will every day be
the more. Therefore, let me entreat you to press the having all these
things taken into consideration.”</P>
<P>“As for news, you had the contents of the King of Spain's will in the
last Paris Gazette, viz. The duke of Anjou is named to the entire suc∣cession
of the whole monarchy, failing him the duke de Berry, and fail∣ing
him the archduke, second son to the Emperor, and after him the
duke of Savoy.”</P>
<P>“The bees [city] you mention have been and are still very troublesome,
and that you will see confounds all and makes us despair of all the rest,
when so little a thing cannot be removed. So that all I can say is, that,
if you could get the bees [city] recommended by the worthies you men∣tion
in yours as injurious to them, in the present conjuncture, and that,
at such a time, when they are setting up for good management, every thing
should appear by actions, as the parting with such as have wasted by
their profuseness, and destroyed by their councils all the improvements
that might have been made: that it is not agreeable with good manage∣ment
to put strangers over a family, that reckons they have wiser people
of their own. The oldest of the bees [city] is supported by nothing
now, but the shame of acknowledging a fault, and it's he only that sup∣ports
the rest; and instructions upon that, from these people, would be
well taken, but from no other, shewing them, that persevering in bad
things is the greatest fault, and coming out of it makes the greatest
amends that can be for any fault: that, whilst they think to cover it, by
their perseverance, the meanest capacities of their servants see it, and con∣sequently
despise them for it.”</P>
<P>“Since I begun to write this letter, I have got yours of the 28th, and
I thank you for the account you give me of that worthless fellow. I am
satisfied of the truth of it; for these letters have been shewn on this side,
as well as on yours; and yet for all that, and all we could say of the
affront and injury done to the person of honour, which Mr. Mons repre∣sented
very warmly, the M. i. i. f. c. y. and his gang carried it, and he
was justified. If that gentleman knew what Mr. Mons said upon that
head, he would be well pleased; but he was answered, that it was other∣wise:
that, far from doing him prejudice, he had served him. In a word,
<PB N="584" REF="612"/>

he sets up for; and he certainly was sent thither for that end.”</P>
<P>It is probable, that some of those members, in both houses of parlia∣ment,
who moved for the severe addresses to King William, on the
treaties of partition, in March 1701, were acquainted with the senti∣ments

<P>“IN my last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> I gave you the account of the King of Spain's death, and
that the entire succession to these great dominions were given to the
duke of Anjou, &amp;c. and now what may be the consequence of it, is, at
present, the great subject of our discourse and reasoning. The French
reckon themselves much obliged to the league they lately made with
Holland and England; and, indeed, so they may: for that, and that
only, has put a constraint upon Spain to put aside the arch-duke; seeing
themselves under a necessity either to do that or have their dominions
torn in pieces by the partage. I long extremely to hear how this will
be taken by the parliament, and by the wise people of England. For
here was a league made, without advising and consulting them upon the
matter, and certainly very much to the prejudice of trade and interest
of the nation, which, no doubt, would have been examined into by the
parliament; and, indeed, if it was reasonable to do it then, it is no
less reasonable to do it now, upon what has happened. For, in all re∣spects,
this settlement has, at least, as bad an aspect towards England,
as the other. Humanly speaking, here is a friendship betwixt the two
crowns of Spain and France for fifty years, taking in a grandfather, a
father, and a brother's friendship to a King of their own setting up. What
trade can England propose to have in the Mediterranean, and in all the
Spanish dominions, if France vie with them for it, though there be no
war; and if there be, how can they maintain a fleet, without the assist∣ance
of the Spanish ports and harbours? And it is evident; that this,
and whatever worse consequences may arise from it, it is this triple
league that is the occasion; since it brought them upon the necessity
<PB N="585" REF="613"/>
before mentioned. The duke of Bavaria has writ to the King of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.—Dec.</NOTE>
and the general of their forces in the Netherlands will be at Versailles
the morrow: so that you fee here Flanders consenting already; and in
what a condition would the Hollanders be, though Spain never made
war upon them, but only were, in case of a war betwixt France and
them, consenting to their troops marching through Flanders? And what
would become of that bulwark which England and Holland have for∣merly
thought their interest to maintain, though at their own charges,
and which, in all appearance, is now lost by a league of their own mak∣ing
with the King of France? Doctor Davenant will not need burn
his book against the league, but add an appendix, to show that it has
had the same evil consequences, or rather worse, than it could have had,
if all things had flood as they were when it was made, and the exe∣cution
been made accordingly.”</P>

the other, how you reason upon this great affair of the Spanish suc∣cession,
whereof you had my opinion, upon the 24th of November,
N. S. Of both, I hope to have something from you by the next.
As to the Scotch parliament, by other letters, I am glad to find all goes
for the court. You know my opinion as to John Murey's [the King's]
affairs, is the same with yours; and yet, if it were possible to persuade
people to accept of what he offers, it would bring every thing into the
same channel that we propose it to run in, by a more natural way than all
other overtures can make it; and, by this method too, you see he does
not desire to be milled: for he gives all out of his own hands, But
this is an argument that I would not have you make use of with the
colonel; and yet it is the best thing could happen, both for him and his
friends. But all propositions any other way, in our parts, that is down∣right,
will be to no purpose; and yet, upon your side of the water,
they would naturally of themselves consider this and press it, where there
is occasion. The bees [city] are a dead weight upon them, and look
more like a judgment than any thing else; they being an abomination
<PB N="586" REF="614"/>
to all the rest of mankind but themselves; and this case truly stated, by
the colonel's friends, would be of great use for them and us too, and I
am persuaded they suffer, at lead, as much by them as we do.</P>
<P>Yesterday, the Dutch ambassador was at Versailles, to demand an
audience of the King, and was refused. It is said the King of France
should say, that, when he had his audience of the King of Spain, he
should have it of him. Whether he said this or not, I cannot be po∣sitive.
But it is certain he was refused, and that to the seeing of as
many as were about the King's apartments at the most public time of
the day; and, it is believed, the English ambassador will be served just
so. Thus, you see what that secret treaty is like to bring us to. How
seasonable it may be to think upon John Murey's [the King's] propo∣sition,
I leave you to judge.”</P>

<P>“I Have seen yours of the 27th of November;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> and I am glad you are
got safe to London. I find you are alarmed there with the duke of
Anjou being declared King of Spain, and, no doubt, you have rea∣son;
for the consequences of it may be still greater than your appre∣hensions
of them are. It is not probable, that the duke of Bavaria will
remain long governor of Flanders, though he has sent his compliments
to the King of Spain, and done all other marks of joy and acknowledg∣ment
upon that subject. The general of the Spanish forces in Flanders
was likewise with the King of Spain before he went from hence; and
was immediately sent back, upon an express from the duke of Bavaria,
upon some apprehensions they had of the Dutch garrisons. It is certain
that the King of France asked the Spanish ambassador what their debt
was to the Dutch, for which they had the possession of these towns. He
answered, six million. Well, says the King, if the councils of Spain
think fit to free themselves of these garrisons, I will make good the
money. So that you see there is made good what you seem in England
to fear, in the most material part. Besides, the governor of the French
Flanders has orders to send the duke of Bavaria or the Spanish general
what troops they shall demand, upon any occasion.”</P>
<P>When I think upon the consequences that this succession to Spain may
produce, I cannot but reflect upon the means and instruments that have
<PB N="587" REF="615"/>
been made use of to bring it about. To say, that England and Hol∣land
should be these instruments, is strange, and yet certainly true. For
that secret treaty, made by the King of England and the Dutch with
France, has put the Spaniards upon a necessity of doing for themselves
the wisest thing they ever did, calling the duke d'Anjou to be their King;
for nothing but this necessity could have made them lay aside the
Austrian family. They saw, by this secret league, their territories di∣vided,
their monarchy torn in pieces, a power set up against them,
France, England, and Holland to make good their division, too strong
for them and all they could expect to assist them; and so, by giving it
to the duke of Anjou, humanly speaking, they have secured to them∣selves
a peace with France for fifty years, entailed upon the life of a
grandfather, a father, and a brother, who will think it their glory to
maintain a son of France in these great dominions; and it is not to be
doubted, but the children of his body will be as good Spaniards as ever
were before them; so that Spain has acted a wise part.</P>
<P>It's dangerous for any state to be governed by a head that is no∣tional;
for such are generally given to try experiments. What greater
security could England have, than in the Augsburg league? Why was
not that renewed, which would have kept the kingdom in peace for
hundreds of years, in all probability? But this treaty, amongst other
things, has destroyed the credit and friendship the Austrian family can
have for our King hereafter. So that, by this <HI>tour de baton,</HI> he has lost
his new friends and his old ones together.</P>
<P>Your cousin [the King] is very well. I never saw so great a change up∣on
a man, in so little time. I was with him, at Versailles, when the King
of Spain parted; and I dare be bold to say, that, if you see him three
or four months hence, you will admire the alteration, with great joy.
My friend and his partner give you both their humble service; and they
do not doubt but you will mind them upon occasion. I am,</P>

had often declared, that he was more beholden to the prince of
Orange than to all the world besides. The King of France came to
wait upon him. He lighted at the castle-gate, as others did, to prevent
the noise of coaches from disturbing him. Just before he expired, he
mentioned by name, with a loud voice, the prince of Orange, the
princess of Denmark, and the Emperor; and said he wished they might
be acquainted that he forgave them all. The King of France, the third
time he came to fee the King, declared he would own the prince of Wales
King of England. He had hesitated long. The dauphin, the duke of
Burgundy, and all the. princes thought it unbecoming the dignity of
the crown of France, not to own the title of the prince of Wales, He
first acquainted the Queen, then the Prince, of his resolution. He came,
at last, to the King's bed-side. “Sir,” said he, “I am come to see
how your Majesty finds, yourself to-day.” But the King nor hearing,
made no reply. Upon which, one of his servants telling him, that the
King of France was there, he rouzed himself, and said, “Where is he?”
Upon which the King of France replied, “Sir, I am here, and I am come
to see how you do?” The King thanked him for all his favours. His
most Christian Majesty replied, “Sir, what I have done is but a small
matter. I have something to. acquaint you with of greater consequence.”
The King's servants began to retire. “Let nobody withdraw”, said the
King of France. “I am come, Sir to acquaint you, that whenever it
shall please God to call your Majesty out of this world, I will take your
family into my protection, and will treat your son, the prince of Wales,
in the same manner I have treated you, and acknowledge him, as he then
<PB N="590" REF="618"/>
will be, King of England.” All that were present, whether French or
English, burst at once into tears, expressive of a mixture of joy and
grief. Some threw themselves at his most Christian Majesty's feet. All
seemed so much affected, that the King of France himself burst into
tears. The King of England was endeavouring to say something. But
the confused noise was so great, and he so weak, that he could not be
heard. The King of France went away. But as he passed, he called
the officer of the guard, and desired him to treat the prince of Wales as
King, whenever his father should expire.”</P>
<P>“The next day, the King was something better. The prince of Wales
was permitted to see him, which he was not often suffered to do; it be∣ing
observed, that when he saw him, it raised such a commotion in him,
as was thought to do him harm. When he came into the room, the
King stretching forth his arms to embrace him, said, “I have not seen
you since his most Christian Majesty was here, and promised to own you
when I should be dead. I have sent my lord Middleton to Marly, to
thank him for it.” He was taken next day with continual convulsions
and shaking in his hands; and, on the day following, being the sixteenth
of September, he expired.”</P>
<P>“He was something above the middle stature, well-shaped, very nervous
and strong. His face was rather long, his complexion fair, his coun∣tenance
engaging. But his outward carriage was a little stiff and con∣strained.
He was not so gracious as he was courteous and obliging.
He was affable and of easy access. He affected no formality, though
no one knew the ceremonial better, nor was more exact in the observa∣tion
of them when necessary. In his conversation and arguing, he en∣deavoured
rather to convince with good reason than fine expressions;
and having some hesitation in his speech, his discourse was not so grace∣ful
as it was judicious and solid. He abhorred the duplicity of a
refined courtier. He was an assured friend, if he professed it; and
when he could not serve a man, he let him instantly know it. His
temper was naturally hot and choleric. But, in his latter days, he got
the better of that; and, even in his younger days, it seldom so much
overpowered him, as to make him do any action unbecoming. Though
he was diffident of men, he was no less unsuccessful, when he reigned,
in detecting his enemies, than he had been, the most part of his life, in
<PB N="591" REF="619"/>
choosing his friends. He was a great lover of walking and hunting.
But no diversion made him neglect business; to which he had so great
an application, that it seemed to be of the number of his diversions.
He was so distinguishiable for this, that, during his younger days, not∣withstanding
the unsettledness of his condition, while he lived in exile,
he had not only performed his duty with great exactness, but kept an
account of all occurrences; and he has obliged posterity with better me∣morials
under his own hand, than perhaps any sovereign prince has been
known to leave behind him before.”</P>
<P>“He was, all his life, a great enemy to drinking, gaming, and indeed
to all diversions which commonly render men incapable of business.
He avoided always the loss of time, which he counted precious, and
ever managed with great circumspection. Even women, of whom he
was fond, never induced him to neglect his business, run into extravagant
expence, or totally forgetful of his duty. He was a kind husband, notwith∣standing
his love of women. His affection for the Queen was mixed
with a respect and deference. He was the best father in the world, and
the most unfortunate in some of his children; the best master, yet the
worst served; a most constant friend, yet never prince found fewer, in
his greatest necessities. He was so fond of his children, in particular,
that when he found the princess of Denmark had deserted him, upon
his return from Salisbury, he only seemed anxious about her health, and
fears for her miscarriage.”</P>

<HEAD>“The attestation of Sir David Nairne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 57.</NOTE> concerning what he knew of the life
and virtues of the late King of Great Britain, James the second.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Paris, 1734.</OPENER>
<P>“AS I have the honour of having been near thirteen years, in the
service of the late King of Great Britain, James the Second, of
blessed and holy memory, and having followed him, in that time, to
Ireland, La Hogue, and Calais, and of having been every where a wit∣ness
of his holy life, particularly at St. Germains, where I had likewise
the misfortune to be present at his last sickness and death; it is sup∣posed,
that, old as I am now, at the age of seventy-nine years almost
<PB N="592" REF="620"/>
complete, I may be still able to recollect some circumstances of the life
of that prince. Accordingly, it is just now intimated to me, that I shall
be summoned one of these days, with some other old officers of his
Majesty's houshold, to give each of us, an authentic testimony of his
life and manners; and I am advised, at the same time, to put in writing,
for the sake of greater exactness, whatever I can remember.”</P>
<P>“This then I am going to do, with all the sincerity I can, and as in
the presence of God, before whom I must appear being very sorry that
my memory (which was never very good, and which is less so to-day
than ever) cannot second my zeal upon this occasion so much as I
would choose. For the present King of Great Britain (in the service
of whom, and of the late King, his father, I have the honour of hav∣ing
passed upwards of forty-six years) knows, that it is on account of
my great age and of my infirmities, that he was pleased, last year, to
grant me permission to retire from his court at Rome, (where I was no
longer fit for business) and to come to finish my days in quietness in
France. But yet, notwithstanding my want of capacity, I shall obey
the orders, which have been intimated to me, as faithfully as I possibly
can.”</P>
<P>“To begin, I can attest with truth, that I have always observed, in King
James the Second, of happy memory, a great fund of goodness and re∣ligion,
an upright mind, a good heart, a great regularity of life, a pater∣nal
affection for all his loyal subjects and servants; and, above all, an
inviolable attachment to the holy see, and to the catholic, apostolic, and
Roman religion, to which he had already sacrificed his three crowns,
and was disposed to sacrifice further his life, if necessary, as he often
protested.”</P>
<P>“I attest, that during the residence of that prince at St. Germains, he
heard ordinarily two masses every day, one in the morning, and another
towards noon. That he performed his devotions, on all the great festi∣vals,
and likewise on several other days of the year, and then heard, for
the most part, three masses; and if, on these days, there were vespers,
sermon, and exaltation of the host, at the parish church, or at the chapel
of the castle, or the church of the Recoletts, he was there, and, in every
lent and advent, he had sermon in his chapel thrice a week, and he
never failed to go there regularly, attended always by the Queen, his
<PB N="593" REF="621"/>
religious consort, who was likewise, as every one knows, an example of
piety. They went likewise together, every year, on foot, to the proces∣sion
of the holy sacrament, with the parish, over all the town of St.
Germains. On the day and octave of Corpus Christi, and at the return
of that long procession, they staid to hear high mass, at the parish
church; and, on every evening, during the octave, they were present at
the exaltation of the host; and, as there was scarcely a Sunday or a great
holy-day, during the year, but there was an exaltation at the parish
church, their Majesties were always present; and when there was no
established fund for saying mass, they ordered one to be said, which kept
up a great deal of devotion in the place, and edified every one.”</P>
<P>“In other respects, this pious prince so divided his time, between the
duties of his station and those of religion, that the one never interfered
with the other; and that all his hours were regulated, both for giving
audience to his ministers and others, and for sleeping, rising, eating, and
walking, as well as for praying and pious reading and writing, insomuch,
that he was remarkable for his great exactness.”</P>
<P>“He was very charitable; and, as there were a great many of his poor
faithful subjects, at St. Germains, who had lost their fortunes to follow
him, he was touched with their condition, and retrenched, as much as
he could, to assist them. He used to call, from time to time, into his
cabinet, some of these bashful, indigent persons, of all ranks, to whom
he distributed, folded up in small pieces of paper, five, ten, fifteen, or
twenty pistoles, more or less, according to the merit, the quality, and the
exigency of each.”</P>
<P>“He charged some of his chaplains to take care, that none of his catho∣lic
servants failed to perform their devotions regularly at Easter; and, as
he was the mildest and best of masters, and loved all his servants and
desired their eternal happiness, he lamented the misfortune of such of
them, as had been educated in the protestant religion, and through pre∣possession,
or a false point of honour or human considerations, persisted
in it. He prayed to God, with all his heart, for their conversion, and
sometimes, took occasion to exhort them, to think seriously of inquiring
whether they were in the true church or not, since upon that depended
their eternal salvation; and he gave them sometimes good books to
<PB N="594" REF="622"/>
read. But he always spoke to them with mildness and discretion, letting
them always understand, that he never meant to force the consciences of
his subjects; believing himself obliged to be a common father to all, in∣dependently
of the differences of religion.”</P>
<P>“He, as well as the late Queen, his consort, was much addicted to the
continual adoration of the host, established in the parish of St. Germain;
and for that purpose, he set apart his hour and day of the year for going
after dinner to the parish church, to continue an entire hour in prayer and
meditation on his knees before the august sacrament of our altars; a
devotion, to which the King, his son, continues to be much addicted,
with the Queen, his consort.”</P>
<P>“He practised, from time to time, spiritual retirements, for seven or
eight days, in some religious house at Paris, from whence he went every
day incognito, with a few attendants, to visit churches and to be present
at sermons, masses, and salues; and when it was Easter-week, he went
to the passion sermon and night offices. He was likewise three or four
times in retirement at La Trappe; one of which times I remember to
have been, as he was on his way to La Hogue. He staid there usually
three days, practising nearly the same abstinence with the monks, and
being present at a great part of their service.”</P>
<P>Nairne, having giving several particular instances, of James's constant
and unwearied attention to excite the same spirit of devotion in others, proceeds to give an account of his sickness and death.</P>
<P>“I attest then, that, in this sickness, he edified all those who were
about him, as well protestants as catholics, by his great patience in his
sufferings and by his perfect resignation to the holy will of God, as to
both life and death: that he confessed and communicated more than
once, during his sickness, and manifested always an extreme sorrow for
his past sins, and a sincere design for continuing to do penance for them,
not only in this world, but also in purgatory, if it was the will of God;
for so he explained himself.</P>
<P>That his great charity appeared, in this respect, that God gave himgrace
to forgive cordially all his enemies, and to pray for them; and, by name,
for the Emperor and even the prince of Orange, saying aloud, that he was,
in some measure, obliged to his enemies for the mercy which he hoped
<PB N="595" REF="623"/>
God would show him; because, if he had remained on his throne and
continued always in prosperity, he would not, perhaps, have ever thought
of the great work of his salvation, as seriously and as efficaciously as he
ought.</P>
<P>That his paternal affection for all his faithful subjects and servants,
who had followed him in his exile and remained constantly attached to
him, seemed to redouble, in proportion as he drew near his end: so
that it might be said of him, <HI>in finem dilexit eos.</HI> Accordingly, he re∣commended
them all, in the same manner with his royal family, to the
protection of the most Christian King, when his Majesty came to see
him in his sickness; and he had the consolation, before his death, to
know, from that great and generous Monarch's own mouth, that he
would acknowledge the prince of Wales, his son, for King, as soon as God
had disposed of him. He spoke, in short, with so much goodness, to the
principal noblemen of his court, when he saw them about his bed, that
they were all tenderly affected by it, seeing the zeal and real affection,
with which he spoke to them of God, and exhorted them to think of their
salvation and of death and eternity.</P>
<P>Here, I imagine, I ought not to pass over, in silence, a fact, which is
public and which is very remarkable, viz. that the earl of Middleton,
secretary of state to his Britannick Majesty, who was then a protestant,
a man of polite learning and of great genius and capacity, as well as of
honour and loyalty to his lawful King, was one of those, to whom his
Majesty had spoke of religion, on his death-bed. Now the consequence
has shown, that what his Majesty said to him then, on the subject, had
made a deep impression on his mind. For a little time after the death
of the King, God, in mercy to that nobleman, touched his heart, in
such a manner, that, when it was least expected, he retired, on a sudden,
to the English seminary, at Paris; where, after having finally satisfied
himself, in some doubts which remained with him concerning our reli∣gion,
he abjured his own, and was received into the bosom of the catho∣lic,
apostolic, and Roman church, in which he always persevered while
he lived and died a good and zealous catholic. Every one ascribed this to
the prayers of the King, his master, and to the blessing which God gave
to his exhortations to him before he died.</P>
<P><PB N="596" REF="624"/>
I attest, finally, that his Majesty, more than once, declared, on his
death-bed, that he died a son of the catholic, apostolic, and Roman
church; and gave, to his last breath, incontestible proofs of the strength
of his faith, of his inviolable attachment to the holy see, and to all the
truths of our holy religion, and of his filial obedience to our most holy
father, the pope. In these truly catholic sentiments I have seen this
great prince die, after having received all the sacraments, with an exem∣plary
devotion, and having edified all the beholders by his patience and hu∣mility,
by his entirely detaching himself from this world, and by his ardent
love to Jesus Christ, in whose merits he placed all the foundation of
his hopes for eternity; and lastly, by all the marks of a compunction,
the most lively and most suitable to the contrite and humble heart of
a penitent and holy King.</P>
<P>Thus died, the real death of the righteous, and with a great repu∣tation
of sanctity, James the Second of blessed memory, King of Great
Britain, at the castle of St. Germains, the sixteenth of September, 1701,
after a sickness of several days. His body was transported, three or
four days thereafter, to Paris, and deposited in the church of the Eng∣lish
Benedictents, in the suburbs of St. James, where the people of
Paris, convinced of the sanctity of this prince, and persuaded that the
church would declare its opinion in this respect, at a proper time
and place, began immediately to revere his memory before-hand, and
to go in crowds to the church where his body was deposited, to
celebrate masses and neuvaines, for asking several favours of God,
through the intercession of this good King. Accordingly, there is found,
to this day, in the registers of that church, a particular account of several
miraculous cures, or such as appeared, at least to be so, wrought upon
sick persons, through the intercession, as was piously believed, of this
holy King; and afterwards, of the masses, which were said in that
church, agreeably to the intention of these persons. Among others, there
is an attestation, that my deceased wife had a neuvaine celebrated in that
church, for my son, who was then about five years of age and troubled
with a rupture, of which he was cured, a little after the neuvaine was
finished; and he has felt nothing of that inconveniency ever since, How∣ever,
I attest nothing here but facts, as it does not become me to enter
into a discussion of what is or is not miraculous. I shall only say, that
<PB N="597" REF="625"/>
the public have considered, as a real miracle, the sudden and remark∣able
cure of a fistula lachrymalis, wrought at that time, on the late
Monsieur Roquette, bishop of Autun, nephew to the famous Mr.
Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, after prayers addressed to God by that prelate,
through the intercession of our King. This fact may be verified still,
by the authentic testimonies of it, which are to this day preserved.</P>
<P>These are all the particulars which I can recall to my remembrance of
the later years of the life and also of the last sickness and death of King
James the Second, of Great Britain, with regard to his life and morals,
I shall only add, with regard to his Christian sentiments, that I know
he has left, written in his own hand, incontestible proofs of his piety, in
many of his manuscripts, of which I have seen, read, and copied a great
number. It is from the great confidence, which the two Kings, father
and son, were pleased to place in me, that I am now able to attest still
this last great proof, which is preserved, of the solid piety of this great
and virtuous prince, whose soul, we have reason to hope, is now recom∣pensed
a hundred fold in heaven, for the great injustice which was done
him on earth, and for the kind of martyrdom which he suffered for the
faith.</P>
<P>In witness of the truth of all that is said above, I sign this attestation,
at Paris, the third day of July, one thousand seven hundred and thirty∣four;
after having received, this morning, a citation to appear, on the
fifth of this instant month of July, at the archbishopric, to make oath,
before the judges appointed to examine the witnesses, summoned in the
cause of the deceased King of England, James the Second of blessed me∣mory,
and to receive their deposition.</P>

<P>It seems to have been seriously intended to apply for James's canonization. His super∣stitious votaries had begun to collect such proofs as had been always thought sufficient to obtain a place in the Romish calendar. This appears sufficiently from Nairne's attesta∣tion, and from the following extracts.</P>
<Q>“An Extract of several miraculous cures performed by the intercession of the late James the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. ii. No. 4.</NOTE> King of Great Britain.”</Q>
<P>1. The bishop of Autun, at the age of eighty, was cured of a fistula lacrymalis, with which he had been troubled for forty years. The superior of the Carmalitesses, in the Fauxbourg, St Jaques, at Paris, told him that the deceased King's first miracle would be in his favour. A nun of the convent of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary at Chaillot, where James had frequently resided, gave the good bishop the same assurance. Both of them promised to pray for his cure, through the intercession of the holy Monarch. The superior of the Nuns of Chaillot invited him to say mass for the repose of the King's soul, on the twenty-sixth of September, and he found himself cured when he came out of the church. The bishop gave a minute account of all this in a long letter to the Queen, of which a copy, in Nairne's hand, is annexed to this extract.</P>
<P>2. Gilbert Marais, a surgeon at St. Pourcain, in Auvergne, and brother to the cure of the parish, both natives of the place, was cured of a palsy in both his legs, through the intercession of the King of England, on the twenty eighth of October, 1701. The miracle is attested by the cure, in a letter to the archbishop of Vienne, who inclosed the cure's letter, and a minute detail of all the particulars of the cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, signed by the curé, and by Gilbert Marais himself, in a letter to the superior of the nuns at Chaillot, to be communicated to the Queen. All these vouchers, in Nairne's hand, are annexed to the extract.</P>
<P>3. Passart de la Rotte, King's counsellor in the supreme court at Metz, was cured of a retention of urine, on the fifteenth of November, 1701. The particulars of the miracle, in Passart's own attestation, annexed to the extract in Nairne's hand, are as follow: On the fifteenth of October, 1701, as he was setting out from Paris on his return to Metz, Passart was seized with a retention of urine. He was bled eight times; he remained in great torment for eight day, and was assured by the ablest physicians in Paris, whom he consulted, that though his life was in no danger, he could not be cured in five or six. weeks. He was alarmed at the prospect of remaining so long in pain, and prayed to the deceased King for his intercession, making a vow, that if he should be cured through the holy Monarch's intercession, he would perform his devotions in the chapel where the body lay, the first day he could go out. His prayer was heard, and the next day he per∣formed his vow.</P>
<P>4. Philip Pitel, a Benedictine Monk, of the Abbacy of Beuilly, in the diocese of Tours, was cured of a suffocating cough, on the sixth of December, 1701. He was seized with a sit of the cough as he went from his father's house to the sorbonne, and lost all sensa∣tions instantaneously. Bleeding, and the usual remedies, were tried in vain. A swelled throat for many days prevented him from taking any sustenance, and almost from breath∣ing. In this distress, he felt a sudden and unaccountable impulse to prefer the following prayer: “O God, I beseech thee, mercifully to cure me, and to grant me health, through the merits and intercession of King James; and I promise to have a mass said, as a thanksgiving, in the Benedictine church, where his corpse lays, and to touch the mort-cloth, which covers it, with my tongue.” The patient soon felt a profuse sweat breaking out over all his body, and in due time his recovery was completed. His own attestation of these particulars, signed in the presence of his confessor, the curé of St. Sulpice, is in Nairne's hand, annexed to the extract.</P>
<P>5. Le Brun, a priest of the oratory, and professor of theology and ecclesiastical history, attests, that Catharine Duprè was cured of deafness.</P>
<P>6. The prior and three monks of the English Benedictine Convent at Paris, with other two, sign as witnesses to the declaration of Francis L'Epervier, dancing-master to the duke of Saxe Gotha. L'Epervier declares that his wife was cured of a rheumatism, by the intercession of the deccased King; and her surgeon and his apprentice, declare that they did not contribute to the cure. There are some other cures attested in the same manner. The account, at length, of the miraculous cures wrought through the inter∣cession of James, consists of thirteen quarto, and thirty-two folio pages, but as there are very few now a days who read the legends of saints, or can relish compositions which resemble those of the tenth and eleventh centuries, it is supposed the reader will think the above a sufficient specimen.</P></NOTE>.”</CLOSER>

<HEAD>ORIGINAL PAPERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1702.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor intends from this period to contrast the papers of the family
of Hannover with those of the house of Stuart. The correspondence
of the first is not so important in the early part of queen Anne's reign as it
became afterwards, when a near prospect of her death rendered them and
their friends anxious concerning the succession to the throne. The
sntrigues of the excluded family having languished, during the last years of
the life of James the second, were not yet renewed with any degree of
industry under his son. The adherents of the Stuarts were, however,
not entirely idle. Immediately upon the death of James, they began to
sound some of those who had made the greatest professions, and now pos∣sessed
the most power to serve their cause. Among these were the earl
of Marlborough and the lord Godolphin, who renewed to the son the as∣surances
which they had made to the father. But the death of King
William, by bringing the possession of the throne one step nearer to the
old stock, cooled the zeal of the abettors of the hereditary descent of the
crown. In this state of affairs, the correspondences of the court of St.
Germains could not regain their former importance, though they con∣tain
several anecdotes, as curious in themselves as they are altogether
unknown. The Stuart-papers in the present year are prior in date to
those of the family of Hannover, and therefore they are placed first; an
order, which, for the sake of regularity, shall be observed throughout
the collection.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Church of England against the Hannover succession.—They agreed to it
from an opposition to France.—They dread the Presbyterians.—The Inde∣pendents
enemies to both.—They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re republicans, and against an episcopal
or Presbyterian King.—The conduct and opinions of the Quakers.—The
nonjurors are zealous.—The Roman Catholics are timid.—The reasons
and necessity of taking some measures before the prince of Orange dies.
The prejudices against him.—State of Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>“IT seems to me absolutely necessary, first to weigh well and con∣sider
the present temper England and Scotland are in, before any
just judgment can be made of what is necessary to be done, for uniting
the several interests of the two nations to concur in his Majesty's service.</P>
<P>As for England the parties most to be considered are;</P>
<P>First, the episcopal, which being in possession of the bells is by far the
most numerous, though not the most active; for being at their ease and
possessing not only the tythes but the magistracy and profitable employ∣ments
of the nation, they flatter themselves with an opinion, that upon
any emergency or change of state, they shall be able to give the law to
all other interests. And it is not improbable they might, could they find
out a way to settle the crown upon any solid basis. But that not being
possible to be done but in the right line, that party rather suffers than ap∣proves
of what has been clone, by adding the house of Hannover to their
weak and trembling intail, which, as it was the project only of the prince
of Orange and his Dutch council, is by many suspected, but despised by
more, nor could have passed the house of commons, but that they were
<PB N="603" REF="631"/>
told it was the only way to express a contempt of the power of France,
and by that means to make the people believe that they feared nothing
thence, and likewise to oblige that monarch to apprehend their power to
be much greater than indeed it is, to stave off a war they more appre∣hend
and dread themselves than he needs to do, notwithstanding all the
rabble and trading part of the nation are universally for it.</P>
<P>The next party requires consideration is the Presbyterian, which con∣sists
of a malicious, sower, and subtle part of men, who are more united
in malice than the former, and do with their demure countenances and
outside pharazaical righteousness draw from the churches to their meet∣ing
houses the most hypocritical part of the trading people; so that their
numbers are wonderfully increased of late years, to the terror of the
aspiring part of the episcopal parsons, who dread that bishops, deans,
and chapters, are tumbling down again, knowing bare competencies too
weak supports for their dissolute and scandalous lives.</P>
<P>The next to be considered is the Independents, under which denomi∣nation
may be included that rabble of divers sects, which by above fifty
several whimsical societies, ingross in the whole a greater number of dis∣senters
to the prelatical church than the presbyterians do, and are mortal
enemies to both, including within them that sort of men which are most
properly called republicans or commonwealth men, a restless, bold,
and busy-spirit, easiest to be gained to your Majesty's interest, it be∣ing
become a maxim amongst the wisest of them, that since it appears
impracticable to unite and settle all interests in a commonwealth, it is
absolutely necessary to restore your Majesty and the right line, to keep off
the necessity of a perpetual war, which these botching intails apparently
threatens, the nation with. Nay, in their maxims they go farther, and
say, that it were better for the kingdom in general, but most for them∣selves
in particular, that the rightful Monarch should be a catholick ra∣ther
than of the episcopal or presbyterian ways, which will ever in their
several turns when united to the crown, persecute or at least discounte∣nance
them.</P>
<P>The numerous party of the Quakers cannot be reckoned under the last
head, and are not to be disregarded as mad men, as they seem to
many to be. For, generally speaking, they are your Majesty's friends,
and in all discourses with their oppugners charge them with their inhuman
and unjust dealing with their rightful prince; an argument that non∣plusses
<PB N="604" REF="632"/>
all, and converts some to see the wickedness of their ways. Be∣sides,
to my certain experience, there are many capable of being agents
and negotiators amongst them, as willing as able if well directed.</P>
<P>Lastly, the non-jurant party of the nation may be thought of, though
not numerous enough without the catholicks to make any considerable
strength or appearance in the field. These, however, are respected as men
of honour, that the penitent or discontented may safely open their minds
to and can confide in, so that properly instructed they are safe agitators dis∣persed
in every corner of the nation, who too, upon occasion, will to a
man appear in the field for your Majesty's service.</P>
<P>As for the Catholicks, though I am sorry to say it, they seem the most
desponding and least useful party in the kingdom; nay, which is worse,
they are the only people who encourage the interested and athiestical to
stick to the prince of Orange, though they both despise and hate him as
much as any; for the avowed despair the priests have brought those to
is so universally owned, that it discourages the waverers from declaring
themselves to be for their duty, and confirms the malicious in their inso∣lence,
so that some course must be taken for altering their conduct and
conversation, or they will prove the greatest remora to any good design
may be set on foot.</P>
<P>This, in short, is the posture I left England in, and may serve for a
plan by which your Majesty may judge, in some measure, what may be
expected from such proposals as have or may be made for your service,
ever premising that the principal adversary has not one Englishman that
loves him or his personal interest, whatever they may the use of his po∣wer;
and therefore I conclude it to be much more easy to push him out of
the saddle, and procure a restoration in his life time, than by expecting his
death. Let a descent be cast according to their malicious intail: for if
the princess of Denmark or any other come to mount the throne, it will
require some considerable time to render hers or their government as
odious as his now is become.</P>
<P>To this I know may be answered, that in his fall the interest of Hol∣land
will be disunited from that of England, and thereby the King of
France will have a much easier game to play for your Majesties service.
Too tender a point I confess to be handled as it ought to be by me, who
cannot penetrate into the mysterious behaviour of that court; and there∣fore
would propose a method to restore your Majesties without the ne∣cessity
<PB N="605" REF="633"/>
of any armed force from them, which perhaps, as the ministers
may manage the matter, might prove of greater detriment than advan∣tage
to that main end, let their King's good-will and candour be never so
great, for I do not in the least doubt the integrity of so glorious a prince,
nor question his earnest desire of being the chief instrument in so great a
work, that he might add that one branch to his many laurels.</P>
<P>But it will be much easier to induce his council to consent to the em∣broiling
of Britain in a civil war than to grant your Majesties sufficient
forces for making a full conquest, which is the only thing can ever
make the Kings of England strong or great, and may I conceive, be
brought about with little help from them, if your Majesties sitting still
at St. Germains will but employ proper agents to foment the present ani∣mosities
in both nations, and by your secret influence bring the several
jarring parties to an open rupture. But till I understand your Majes∣ties
will be willing to lend an ear to some propositions to that purpose,
I am silent.</P>
<P>For it may be the tenderness of your Majesties, for the subjects must
necessarily fall into such a war may prove a scruple you will not easily
get over.</P>
<P>Or, perhaps your Majesties ministers may have promises from
some great ones in both kingdoms that the business will be brought
about some other way, to which it is not proper for me to oppose my
weaker judgment, though I confess myself an absolute infidel to all such
notions, and will be bold to say, had it not been for such chymeras as
I think them, your Majesties might have been freely settled on your
throne long ere this time, by a national force unresistible by your Majes∣ties
most inveterable enemys.</P>
<P>As for Scotland, the ferment there has been so great, and the rage
against the prince of Orange so violent for two years past, that I stood
amazed till I came thither, that no use had been made of it. But now
I discern the mistery, but cannot applaud the wisdom of those who have
occasioned such a stagnation of council in such a turbulence of humours
as has providentially offered themselves for the King's service, of which
I can find no man here yet knows any thing to the purpose, except they
unnecessarily conceal from me their true sentiments of that matter, and
are wiser therein than I conceive they need to be. All which is humbly
submitted, by</P>

<HEAD>1702.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some account of the House of Brunswick-Lunenburgh.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the house of Brunswick-Lunenburgh had for some
time made a considerable figure in Germany, they only became ob∣jects
of attention in Britain, when they were brought into the line of
succession by the act of settlement which received the royal assent in
June 1701. This circumstance drew early upon them the correspondence
of several persons in these kingdoms; and their affairs and opinions are
closely connected with our history, during the whole reign of Queen
Anne. Some account, therefore, of a family destined to sway the scepter
of Britain, may not be an improper introduction to their correspondence
and secret negociations, which are contained in these volumes.</P>
<P>Ernest of Brunswick, duke of Zell, the son of Henry the Young,
duke of Lunenburgh, was the ancestor of all the princes of the house
of Brunswick that now exist. He studied under Luther at Wirten∣burgh,
and was always a zealous assertor of the doctrines of that un∣daunted
reformer. He entered into the league of the protestant princes
against the Emperor Charles V. and was taken prisoner with the elector
of Saxony at the battle of Mulberg 1547. By Sophia, daughter of
Henry duke of Mecklenburgh, he had four sons and four daughters.
Francis Otho, his eldest son, and Frederick his second son died without
issue. His third son Henry of Danneberg, was the founder of the
house of Wolfenbuttle, and from William, his fourth son, is descended
the branch of Hannover-Zell, that now sits on the throne of Great
Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="613" REF="643"/>
Francis Otho, who succeeded his father, sent an embassy to King Ed∣ward
VI. of England, to offer him the assistance of 10,000 men against
France, and to ask his sister the Lady Mary in marriage. But a peace
being concluded between France and England, the duke of Zell's
auxiliaries became unnecessary, and the lady Mary had been then promised
to the infant of Portugal: Edward, however, as a testimony of his re∣gard
for the duke, gave him an annual pension of 375 pounds sterling,
to be paid half-yearly, and continued during pleasure. Francis Otho
died in three months after his marriage with Magdalen, the daughter of
Joachim II. marquis of Brandenburgh; and his second brother, Fre∣derick,
was slain in the battle of Sivershousen. Henry of Danne∣berg,
the third son of Ernest duke of Zell, a prince of an easy temper,
and fond of retirement, having governed his father's dominions jointly
with his brother William, for ten years, contented himself at last with
Wolfenbuttle, and relinquished the rest of his paternal territories to
William and his descendants. This cession made by Henry of his birth,
right was the first step towards the aggrandizement of the younger branch
of the Brunswick family.</P>
<P>William, duke of Zell, the fourth son of Ernest, duke of Lunen∣burgh
and Zell, married Dorothea the daughter of Christian III. King of
Denmark, and had seven sons, and eight daughters. Five of the daugh∣ters
married into considerable families. But six of the seven sons died
without legitimate issue. Christian, who succeeded his eldest brother
Ernest, distinguished himself by his attachment and services to the un∣fortunate
King and Queen of Bohemia, and by his frequent attempts
to assist Maurice prince of Orange. He was made knight of the garter
by King James I. and visited England, in January 1625, where he was
received with the respect due to his rank and abilities. He died of a fever
at Wolfenbuttle, in the June of the following year. He was succeeded
in succession, by his brothers Augustus and Frederick. These two
princes and their brother George, the fifth son of William duke of.
Zell, made a figure in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus, and were con∣cerned
in all the transactions of Germany in the beginning of the last
century. In the year 1648, Frederick, the only surviving son of Wil∣liam,
for his three younger brothers, Ernest, Magnus, and John died before
<PB N="614" REF="644"/>
him, was succeeded in his dominions by his nephews, the sons; of
George.</P>
<P>George, duke of Brunswick and Lunenburgh, the son of William,
duke of Zell, had married Anne Eleonora the daughter of Lewis,
Landgrave of Hesse Darmstad, and left four sons Christian Lewis born
in 1622, George William born in 1624, John Frederick born in 1625,
and Ernest Augustus born in 1629. Christian Lewis resided at Hannover
until the death of his uncle Frederick, when, according to an agree∣ment
with his brothers, he took to his share the duchies of Zell and
Lunenburgh. He died without issue in 1665, and left his possessions
to his brother George William.</P>
<P>George William, duke of Zell and Lunenburgh, the second son of
George duke of Brunswick, fell in love at Brussels, with Eleonora
Desiniers, daughter to Alexander marquis of Olbreuze in Poitou, and
married her with his left hand, as being inferior to him in quality; but
the emperor made her afterwards a princess of the Empire. By her he
had Sophia Dorothea, whom he gave in marriage to his nephew George
Lewis the son of the bishop of Osnaburgh, who was afterwards King of
Great Britain.</P>
<P>John Frederick duke of Hannover, the third son of George duke of
Brunswick, was a Roman Catholick, and in close alliance with Lewis
XIV. He died on his way to Rome in the year 1680, and leaving no
male issue, was succeeded by his brother Ernest Augustus bishop of
Osnaburgh.</P>
<P>Ernest Augustus, the fourth son of George duke of Brunswick, mar∣ried
in 1658, the princess Sophia daughter of Frederick, Elector Pala∣tine
and King of Bohemia, by Elizabeth daughter of James I. King of
Great Britain, and took possession of the bishoprick of Osnaburgh in
1661, by virtue of an article in the treaty of Westphalia, which se∣cured
the succession of that bishoprick alternately to a Roman Catholick
bishop, and to a bishop of the Ausburgh confession, being a prince of
the house of Brunswick.</P>
<P>The bishop of Osnaburgh and his brother John Frederick duke of
Hannover entered into a treaty with Lewis XIV. in 1671. It was pro∣perly
<PB N="615" REF="645"/>
a treaty of neutrality; but, though the duke entered into another
of a more pernicious nature, when the war broke out in 1672, and
was very active in favouring the designs of Lewis, and in obstructing
the operations of the allies, the bishop was brought over to the side of
the latter before the end of the year 1674. He joined his brother the
duke of Zell with 5000 men, in the beginning of the next campaign,
and was with him at the battle of Conserburgh and siege of Treves,
and with the prince of Orange at the siege of Mastricht in 1676. He
continued to serve at the head of his own troops in the Netherlands,
until the treaty of Nimeguen, when he and the other princes of the
house of Brunswick entered into a treaty of peace with France.</P>
<P>The duke of Zell and the bishop of Osnaburgh, now duke of Han∣nover,
upon the death of his brother John Frederick in April 1680, re∣ceived
a visit from the prince of Orange, accompanied by count Waldeck
and other persons of distinction in the autumn in the same year. In 1684,
the two dukes sent 10,000 of their troops, commanded by Frederick
Augustus the second, and Charles Philip the fourth son of the duke of
Hannover, into the emperor's service, who was then at war with the
Turks, and the next year the duke of Hannover sent his third son Maxi∣milian
with 3000 men to serve the Venetians in the Morea. The Emperor
Leopold, at the instigation of William the Third, King of England,
erected a ninth electorate in the person of the duke of Hannover on the
29th of December 1692. This erection was made in opposition to the
elder branch of the family of Brunswick, and of the Roman Catholick
princes, and was not for several years acknowledged in form. Both he
and his brother adhered to the allies, in the war, which was carried on
at that time, against France. They had 6000 men in the Emperor's ser∣vice,
in Hungary, and 8000 of their troops served every campaign under
King William in Flanders, until a peace was concluded at Ryswick:
the elector died the 23d of January 1698, and was succeeded by his
eldest son George Lewis.</P>
<P>The remaining issue of Ernest Augustus, and the princess, Sophia,
were, Frederick Augustus born in 1661, Maximilian born in 1666.
Charles Philip born in 1669. Christian born in 1671. Ernest Augus∣tus
<PB N="616" REF="646"/>
born in 1674, and Sophia Charlotta born in 1668. She married
Frederick III. Elector of Brandenburgh, and she died Queen of Prussia,
February 1, 1705.</P>
<P>Frederick Augustus and Charles Philip commanded the 10,000 men
which the princes of the house of Lunenburgh sent, in 1684, to the
Emperor who was then at war with the Turks. They signalized them∣selves
by their conduct, and valour, and were both slain in battle in 1691.</P>
<P>Maximilian conducted to the Morea the body of troops which his fa∣ther
had in the pay of the republick of Venice in 1686. He served two
campaigns with great distinction under the generals Morosini and Ko∣ningsmark,
and upon the death of Koningsmark, and the sickness of the
Doge Morosini, he had the chief command during a considerable part
of the third. His services were generously rewarded by the Republick
with the rank of general, and an annual pension of 6000 ducats. Upon
his return from Italy, he formed a party to maintain his pretensions to
succeed to the duchy of Zell after the death of his uncle. Some of his
adherents were executed, and he himself was imprisoned for some time:
but he renounced, at last, his pretensions, and agreed to accept of an
annual pension. He entered into the Imperial service upon the breaking
out of the war, which was occasioned by the disputes about the Spanish
succession, in the beginning of this century His brother Christian rose to
the rank of major-general in the same service, but was unfortunately kill∣ed
after the battle of Munderkingen, as he was attempting to swim on
horseback over the Danube, in 1703. Ernest Augustus the sixth, and
youngest son of the Elector and the princess Sophia, served the preceding
campaign under the duke of Marlborough. He was chosen bishop of Os∣naburgh
in March, and was created duke of York and Albany and earl of Ulster, and made a knight of the garter, in July 1716. He died
unmarried on the 14th of August 1728.</P>
<P>George Lewis, afterwards George the First, King of Great Britain,
the eldest son of Ernest Augustus and the princess Sophia, was born
on the twenty eighth of May 1660. When prince of Osnaburgh, he
served, at the age of fifteen, the successful campaign of 1675, under
his father and uncle, and was present at the battle of Conserburgh and

siege of Treves. He became prince of Hannover, upon his father's
accession to that dutchy, after the death of John Frederick, without
male issue, in 1680, and visited France and England in the latter end of
the same year. He came here to make his addresses to the princess
Anne; but he was suddenly recalled by his father, who thought it more
for the interest of their family to marry him to his niece. Wood gives
a very particular account of his reception and creation, as doctor of laws,
at Oxford, in February, 1681. He married Sophia Dorothea, daughter
and heiress of his uncle, George William, duke of Zell, on the eleventh
of November, 1682; and by her had issue, George Augustus, born on
the thirteenth of October, 1683, and afterwards King of Great Britain;
and Sophia Dorothea, born on the eighteenth of March, 1687. She
married Frederick William, King of Prussia, the fourteenth of Novem∣ber,
1706. He succeeded his father, as elector of Brunswick-Lunen∣burgh,
on the twenty-third of January, 1698.</P>
<P>The descendants of James I. and Charles I. who were nearer in blood
to the royal family in England and Scotland than any of the protestant
line, were fifty-seven in number †, when George the First acceded to
the crown of Great Britain; but being Roman Catholics, their preten∣sions
were rejected; and the princess Sophia, electress and duchess
dowager of Hannover, daughter to the princess Elizabeth, late Queen of
Bohemia, daughter of James I. King of England, was declared next in
succession to the crown, by an act which received the royal assent on the
twelfth of June, 1701. The earl of Macclesfield was sent to Hannover
with this act, to the electress, and the garter to her son.</P>
<P>William the Third, King of England, dying on the eighth of March,
1702, was succeeded on the throne by Queen Anne; but notwithstand∣ing
the declarations of the Queen and parliament, in favour of the pro∣testant
succession, and the good reception given to the count de Platens,
envoy extraordinary from the duke of Zell and the elector, the putting
the direction of affairs in the hands of the Tories, gave some apprehen∣sions
to the family of Hannover, as appears from imperfect hints, in the
little we have of their correspondence in the course of this year.</P>
<P>They, however, showed a zeal for the cause in which the British na∣tions
were at this time engaged. A war with France appeared to be
<PB N="618" REF="650"/>
inevitable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Princes, No. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> before the death of King William. Lewis XIV. endeavoured
to gain the German princes to his interest, and, among others, he suc∣ceeded
with the dukes of Brunswick Wolsenbuttle. There are copies
extant, in Robethon's hand-writing, of several letters from King William
to many of these princes.</P>
<P>The dukes, Anthony Ulric and Rodolph Augustus, governed jointly
the dominions of Wolsenbutle. Rodolph cultivated letters and philo∣sophy
in retirement, and left the chief management of affairs to his bro∣ther,
who, from a jealousy of the advancement of the younger branch of
the family, and out of opposition to them, contracted a close alliance
with France.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 11.</NOTE> King William, in a letter to the duke of Ploen, dated at
Dieren, 14th October, 1701, recommending to him to act in concert
with the duke of Zell, who was well affected to the common cause,
desires him to oppose the intrigues of duke Anthony Ulric, and to con∣vince
duke Rodolph of the imprudence of his brother's connexions;
and it appears, by letters from him to the duke of Ploen, and to Rodolph
himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paid. No. 14, 15.</NOTE> dated Hampton-court, 20th December, 1701, that Ploen had
succeeded in detaching Rodolph from the French interest.</P>
<P>But Anthony Ulric continued firm in his engagements with Lewis, un∣til
he was obliged to break them, in consequence of the measures which
King William had concerted with the duke of Zell and elector of Hanno∣ver,
and which they put in execution the week after his Majesty died. They
entered the dominions of Wolfenbuttle unexpectedly, surprised the troops
dispersed in their quarters, invested both Wolsenbuttle and Brunswick at
once, disconcerted all the measures of Anthony Ulric, and obliged him
to leave his brother at liberty to fall in with the common interests of the
empire. The princes of Brunswick Lunenburgh being after this in no
danger of molestation from their neighbours, had upwards of 40,000
men in the service of the different powers who declared war this year
against France and Spain; and prince Ernest Augustus, afterwards bishop
of Osnaburgh and duke of York and Albany, the youngest brother of
the elector, served this campaign under the duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>The name of Monsieur de Robethon will occur so frequently in this
publication, that it cannot be disagreeable to the reader to be informed
of some particulars concerning that industrious servant of the family of
<PB N="619" REF="651"/>
Brunswick Lunenburgh. He appears to have been a French refugee
and a kind of private secretary to King William.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Mis∣cell, d'Etat. 2.</NOTE> There are some letters
addressed to him in that capacity, in Mr. Cole's collection; and in his
own manuscripts, there are letters addressed “to monsieur de Ro∣bethon,
with his Britannic Majesty,” and “to monsieur de Robethon,
secretary to his Britannic Majesty.”</P>
<P>Robethon attached himself to the family of Brunswick, before he left
King William's service. When the duke of Zell came to see the King
at Loo, in the year 1701, lord Portland, who appears to have had a
very great esteem for Robethon, and corresponded constantly with him,
discovers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid vol. marked Schutz Fils. No. 4.</NOTE> by the manner in which he desires him to present his humble
respects to the duke, that he knew then he had a great deal of influence
with his highness.</P>
<P>There is a paper of Robethon's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 210.</NOTE> and indorsed by him, <HI>Speeches for the
King and Queen of Prussia, which I composed for Lord Raby,</HI> 1701. He
wrote all the letters which George the First and Second, and Queen Ca∣roline,
sent to this country from the time he entered into their service,
until the time the family arrived in Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. marked Princes.</NOTE> The first rough draughts of
them are still extant in his hand-writing, and all the originals that may
be in the possession of persons in this and in other countries, are but co∣pies
made from what Robethon wrote for them.</P>
<P>The family of Hannover could not have employed a person better
qualified for their purpose than Robethon; he seems to have been inde∣fatigable,
industrious and faithful, and though he might not have been
a man of striking abilities, he possessed a good deal of address, and a
knowledge of this country sufficient to amuse the numerous correspon∣dents
of the electoral family.</P>

<HEAD>STUART PAPERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1703.</HEAD>
<P>THE duke of Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703. January.</NOTE> always attached to the interests of the exiled
family, had, by a secession from the parliament of Scotland in the pre∣ceding
summer, thrown that assembly into such disrepute with the nation,
that the queen thought it prudent to dissolve it, early in the present year.
He had been followed in this secession by seventy-nine members; and,
therefore, those that remained were denominated the Rump, by the po∣pulace.
The influence which the duke acquired, by this measure, in∣duced
the court of St. Germains to send the following instructions.</P>
<P>They are in French, and in Nairne's hand. The person to whom they
were given was captain James Murray, brother to Mr. Murray of Aber∣cairny.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“Instructions to the person who is to speak to L. A.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii, 4to. No. 50.</NOTE> (meaning Lord Ar∣ran,
the title given to the duke of Hamilton, at St. Germains)
Jan. 1703.”</HEAD>
<P>“AFTER having shown to L. A. all that is necessary to testify to
him the high esteem which their Majesties have for his person and
his merit towards themselves, he is to be entreated to represent to L. C.
[lord Churchill] when he shall find him in the best disposition to listen,
that the union between their families obliges him to be particularly at∣tentive
to every thing which regards his honour, his establishment, and his
safety; which he believes can never be sufficiently secured, without acknow∣ledging
and discharging the obligation which he owes the father, by doing
justice to the son and, in consequence of doing this, he may assure him∣self,
that he will have a carte-blanche for himself and for his friends, and
that otherwise he will have reason to fear disagreeable consequences. For
<PB N="624" REF="656"/>
immediately upon the expiration of the present reign, it will be necessary,
according to the late act of settlement, to proclaim Hannover, who can
never think himself in safety, without relying upon the Dutch, and em∣ploying
his friends of the Presbyterian party in England; and, in that
case, there will be no quarter for him nor for the church of England.</P>
<P>Those, who judge wisely, can have no apprehensions from a Catho∣lic
King, because, as such, he will have neither the credit nor the means
to hurt them; and, to maintain himself, will be obliged to govern ac∣cording
to the will of his people. What is past can be no argument
against this. For it is certain, that the inconveniencies of the wrong
measures, which were formerly adopted, will be sufficient instructions for
regulating those, which will be adopted hereafter, and of this will be
given all the assurances which can be demanded, and which can any∣ways
consist with the security of the King's person, and of his conscience
and dignity.</P>
<P>If he shall scruple to do this, for fear of failing in his duty to the mis∣tress
whom he now serves, it may be said to him, that all these difficul∣ties
may be easily adjusted by a treaty, which will leave her in possession
of the crown of England, during her life, providing that she will choose
to secure the succession to the King, her brother, after her death. To
sill the army, the navy, and all the employments in the kingdom, with
persons who are well affected, are excellent means; but neither these
means, nor the act of occasional conformity, will be sufficient, unless the
settlement, in favour of the family of Hannover, be overturned, which
does not appear to be impracticable, in this parliament, where it may be
represented, as a measure unjust in itself, and dangerous to the church of
England and to the state.</P>
<P>That, considering the justice and piety of his mistress, it is not to be
supposed, that she will be inclined to oppose a thing, so suitable to her
character, and to what she owes to the memory of her father, and to her
own glory; which obliges her not to allow the crown to go out of her
own family, which has been for so many ages in lawful possession of the
royal dignity, and to do all this in favour of a stranger, and of the most
distant relation she has in the world.</P>
<P>The most effectual means of securing the succession of the crown of
England to the King, after the death of his sister, would be to put him
<PB N="625" REF="657"/>
now in possession of the crown of Scotland, by such ways, and in such a
manner, as will be judged most proper; and, as the two kingdoms are
independent of one another, this partition for the present time, might
be easily accomplished; and the English would have less difficulty to con∣sent
to it, that the kingdom of Scotland brings them no profit; and there
is nothing to hinder the King and his sister, after this partition, from
living together in as strict friendship, as their great-grandfather lived
with Q. Elizabeth.</P>
<P>But whether this proposal will be accepted or rejected, it is necessary
that they should enter into a league with France, which, by a secret ar∣ticle,
will engage itself to guarantee our treaty, in order that we may
have the support of a foreign power to balance that of Holland, which,
without that, will join the Presbyterian party, disconcert all weak precau∣tions,
ruin the church of England, and infallibly extirpate it and its
friends.</P>
<P>L. A. is entreated to propose these things, as if they came from himself
alone. But he ought, at the same time, to urge them to employ some
one to explain their intentions, and to learn the sentiments of their Ma∣jesties,
without which nothing can be concluded; and both the one and
the other may ruin themselves by too much precaution. If it is objected,
that a secret cannot be kept at St. Germains; they may address them∣selves
immediately to the court of Versailles, where the same inconveni∣ency
is not to be feared.</P>
<P>And lastly, that delays are dangerous, because all depends on a single
life; and even the life that appears most sure, is very uncertain.”</P>
<P>The following instructions were complied with by the party who ad∣hered
to the duke of Hamilton. They put a stop to the treaty of
Union. They rejected, with every mark of indignation and contempt,
the overture made by the earl of Marchmont, for settling the crown on
the house of Hannover; and they effectually prevented the abjuration.
During a turbulent and tedious session, the country-party in every ques∣tion
prevailed; till, at length, the commissioner found himself obliged to
adjourn the house, without obtaining any supply.</P>

<P>“OUR will and pleasure is, that you repair forthwith to Scotland. At
your arrival at Edinburgh, you are to speak with Gideon Murray,
from whom you will receive some necessary information of men and
matters, and who will introduce you to lord Arran. But in case the said
Gideon should not be there, you may make use of what other persons
you can confide in.</P>
<P>You are to assure the lord Arran of the great sense we have of his
sufferings, services, interest, and prudence, in advising, managing, and
performing what is practicable in the present conjuncture: that you have
orders for our friends to use all their credit in opposing abjuration, Han∣nover,
and union.</P>
<P>That our friends on this side are resolved to give us what assistance
shall be demanded, for our immediate restoration; but are not willing to
venture in matters that are not decisive, and, at best, can but procure
delays. For suppose nothing pass in our prejudice, at present, yet the
danger is still impending for the future; and, if it could be staved off,
till the princess of Denmark dies, yet, if Hannover gets possesion of Eng∣land,
our friends in Scotland could hardly maintain our cause. There∣fore,
it will be necessary, that they should consult together to frame a
project for a general undertaking; and to send over some person or per∣sons,
with a credential signed by the principal undertakers, which may
be safely conveyed by being wrapt up in a thin cake of lead, and dropt
in the sea when in danger of being seized. They must be well instructed
in all particulars relating to this affair, as troops, arms, provisions, com∣missions,
and declaration, time and place of landing.</P>
<P>You are to endeavour to speak with our most trusty friends, and, in
our name, tell them the most obliging things you can devise, as if they
were here specially mentioned. Propose to those of most interest and dis∣cretion
what is above said. Hear every body's notions, and exhort them
all to lay aside private partialities, to concur unanimously in our service,
especially in opposing Hannover, abjuration, and union.</P>

Give us frequent accounts of what you observe there, both as to men
and matters; for which, Gideon will furnish you with a cypher and ad∣dress.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Further Instructions.</HEAD>
<P>“YOU are, in our name, to assure all our loyal subjects, whom you
shall converse with, of the just sense we have of their services and
sufferings; and that we have not of late sent to them, lest we might have
brought them into trouble unnecessarily, when there was no opportunity
of promoting effectually our restoration and their deliverance.</P>
<P>Towards which, they should respectively endeavour to dispose the
people, by assuring such as return to their duty of our special favour;
and to all our pardon, who do not oppose us at our coming, or those
commissioned by us, and such securities for their laws, liberties, and reli∣gion,
as shall be agreed on, in our first parliament, held in our ancient
kingdom of Scotland.</P>
<P>That they shall, by all means possible, oppose any proposal that may
be made of joining with England, in settling the succession on the fa∣mily
of Hannover; and that they ought to consider the project of an
union, as a mere trick to delude and engage them to perpetuate an
usurpation, and all the miseries that attend such a manifest injustice.</P>
<P>That they should maturely deliberate and consult together of what,
when, and how, any thing may be undertaken for us and for themselves;
and to send a proper person to us, well instructed, in all the particulars,
relating to so great and good a design.”</P>
<P>Though Marlborough and Godolphin had manifestly cooled in their
zeal for the exiled family, ever since the accession of the Queen, the
court of St. Germains continued their intercourse with them through
their agents. One of these had proposed to marry the pretended prince
of Wales to one of Marlborough's daughters, even before the death of
the marquis of Blandford had left the duke no hopes of posterity, but
through the female line. The negociation, if it was ever carried to any
height, shews the high opinion which the servants of the pretended prince
entertained of Marlborough's power; at the same time, that it exhibits
the judgment which they formed concerning his invariable attachment
to his own interest.</P>

<P>“I Have received your letter of—which tells me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Caryll's letters, vol. v. fol Scotch College.</NOTE> that Mr. Ar∣not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably Colonel Sackville.</NOTE> has been engaged to propose a match between a daughter of
Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] and young Mr. Manly [the King], of
which you seem desirous to know my opinion. But, unless you let me
know, who this friend is, who hath proposed it, I can make no judg∣ment
of the matter. Pray, therefore, in your next, if you desire my
opinion of the match, give me some light, that I may the better judge
of it, by knowing how qualified and commissioned the proposer is.”</P>
<P>“I do not wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 9th.</NOTE> that Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] comes so
little in your sight. I believe his former engagements, to which you are
a witness, so ill performed by him, make his meeting with you uneasy to
him; and I am fully persuaded, that he makes himself as great a stran∣ger
to all the rest of our factory, as he doth to you. I make it a great
question, whether he be, at present, fully disposed to receive from any
hand such a proposal, as Mr. Painter [colonel Sackville] intimated to
you. Nay, I have some scruple, that, if such a hint should be given
him, he might turn it another way, and endeavour to make the same bar∣gain
with young Hanmer [Hannover]. For, perhaps, he may think that
a safer and an easier bargain; and you well know how true that mer∣chant
is to his interest. In short, there is no more to be said of this mat∣ter,
at present. But we must expect what time may produce.”</P>
<P>“I suppose the absence of Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 9th.</NOTE> for a
while, at least, put a stop to Mr. Painter's [colonel Sackville's] project.
I wonder he did not propose it himself, before Mr. Armsworth [Marl borough]
went into the country [Holland], being well acquainted with
that gentleman; and then he might have known, in an honourable man∣ner,
how it would have taken with him. For you may be sure, nobody
will ever be commissioned, from Mr. Wisely [the Queen], to make such
a proposal.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Wisely [the Queen] is very glad to understand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 7th.</NOTE> that what re∣servedness
was, on their part, proceeded only from those measures, which
were necessary to be kept with that troublesome merchant, Mr. Wanley
<PB N="629" REF="661"/>
[the Whigs]. All that knew Mr. Wisely must confess, that no one ex∣ceeds
him in good nature, and that none can be more sensible than he is
of either the advantages or the losses of his friends; and particularly as
to the good success, which his friends Mr. Gurny [Marlborough] and
Mr. Gilburn [Godolphin] have lately had, in their home affairs. He is
only sorry that it came by any other means, or any other hand than his
own. On the other side, when the news was brought of Mr. Gurny's
[Marlborough] great loss at sea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He means probably the loss of Marlborough's son, who died February 20th, 1703.</NOTE>, it happened that I was the first who told
him of it; and I declare to you, that I was amazed how he was struck at
it. So that in these matters, I hope you will do him justice with your
friend Gilburn [Godolphin], that he may do it also with Mr. Trimin
[duchess of Marlborough] and Young [princess Anne]. I need not tell
you, that, in naming Mr. Wisely [the Queen], I also include Mr. Ma∣thews
[the King]: for, you well know, that their interests are insepa∣rable;
and, though this merchant, last named, be but a young beginner
in the world, yet his qualities and industry are such, that all think he
will make, in a little time, as able and fair a dealer as any that have
come upon the Exchange: nor can I doubt, but Mr. Wheatly [England]
himself will, at last, (all things duly weighed) be convinced it is his inte∣rests
to join stocks with this young merchant, upon reasonable terms.”</P>
<P>In the year 1702,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> captain Simon Fraser, of Beaufort, afterwards well
known to the world, under the title of lord Lovat, went to France, and
pretended to have authority from some of the Scotish nobility and of the
chiefs of the Highland clans, to offer their services to the court of St.
Germains. He promised in their name to raise an army of 12,000
men, if the King of France would consent to land 5000 men at Dundee
and 500 at Fort William. His proposals were listened to, but his sin∣cerity
was questioned, and others in whom the courts of France and St.

<P>“There was given with this, a commission of colonel of foot, to

<P>The dying words of his late master made such an impression,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> on the
earl of Middleton, that, some months after his decease, he left the court
of St. Germains and retired to a convent, at Paris, to be satisfied in some
doubts, and to be instructed in the tenets, of the Roman catholic reli∣gion.
Among Mr. Nairne's MSS. there is a rough draught of the
ostensible reasons, which he himself alleged for leaving the court.</P>
<P>He says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 32.</NOTE> he never thought himself qualified for business. He ac∣cepted
the seals, on condition, that he could resign them, when he
<PB N="632" REF="664"/>
pleased. He thought, as he was now a convert to popery, his con∣tinuing
in office would give offence to protestants in England. He
could have no provocation, in retirement, to resentment or revenge
against enemies; and he would have more time to attend to the duties of
religion.</P>
<P>The earl of Middleton seems to have been out of office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. and vol. ix. 410.</NOTE> near a twelve∣month;

But there are entries of all his letters, from that time to the end of De∣cember,
1713. The first of them which concerns the affairs of Britain,
was written to Monsieur de Torcy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 6.</NOTE> on the first of September, this year.
He inclosed a memorial to him, desiring a passport for a vessel, to go to
Scotland, to bring back captain James Murray, whom lord Arran had
asked, in order to send him back again, with informations concerning the
state of the country, and what they intended to do, when the parliament

<P>THE reason, why I could not answer your last letter sooner, is,
that I could not find an earlier opportunity of writing to you
with safety, and in a circumstantial and particular manner. I believe
the best method of corresponding with you will be, to give you just and
exact representations of matters of fact in England; and, for this pur∣pose,
I must begin with informing you, that there is a party in this
kingdom for the prince of Wales, which is considerable and very zealous,
and whose boldness is founded, not only on their confidence in the King
of France, but on an assurance with which they slatter themselves of
being countenanced and supported by the present government. And
when one considers the men who are advanced and favourably received
at court, it is evident, that there is too much reason to be confirmed in
this opinion.</P>
<P>By a combination of several accidents, which happened since the death
of the King, and which could not probably have happened at any other
time, the members of the house of commons have been chosen in a man∣ner
well calculated to extend the views of that party; and accordingly
they do not scruple to acknowledge this. It is not to be imagined, that
they will choose to act directly for the prince of Wales: accordingly they
have adopted another method, by proposing two bills in the lower house;
the first in order to renew the disputes between the members of the
church of England and the presbyterians, which, having formerly dis∣turbed
the quiet of the kingdom, for a long time, had been suppressed
during the preceding reign; and they hope, that, amidst these animosi∣ties,
they will more easily conceal and advance their designs. The se∣cond
<PB N="635" REF="667"/>
bill appeared to have been intended in favour of those, who, by
accident, had neglected to take the oath of abjuration of the prince of
Wales, in the time limited, and for maintaining the protestant succession;
but the real design was to re-establish all those who had refused that oath,
and to dismiss all such as had been put into their places and offices.</P>
<P>If these two bills had passed, one may easily judge what would have
been the consequence. But the house of peers, having a just apprehen∣sion
of the danger of their designs, rejected, with great firmness, the first,
and not only took every thing that was mischievous and bad out of the
second, but added two clauses to it; by the first of which the oath of
abjuration is imposed upon the whole kingdom of Ireland, which they
had forgot to comprehend in the former act; and the second makes all
those guilty of high treason who shall attempt, either directly or indirectly,
to prevent the succession of the family of Hannover: and all this affair
was conducted by the lords with so much address, that those who brought
in the bill dared not oppose the clause directly, for fear of exposing them∣selves
and losing their credit in the kingdom, and by these means, that
act, far from answering their expectation, has rendered the succession
more stable and certain. But, it must be observed, that this majority
in the house of peers, chagrined the said party to such a degree, that Sir
Edward Seymour did not hesitate to say openly in the house of commons,
that it was absolutely necessary, that the Queen should make some new
peers, in order that the majority of that house might concur in the de∣signs
of the lower house. However indiscreet this speech was, the mea∣sure
has been adopted; for the Queen has made some new peers since
the prorogation of the parliament, of whom the son of Sir E. Seymour
is one, and another is the only man who refused to give his vote for
establishing the succession of the crown in the family of Hannover.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with the character of the rest. I shall only tell
you, that two of them are of the same party. There are none of these
facts which are not manifest, and above all contradiction. If you con∣verse
with your own minister at this court he cannot deny this. Having
now stated the case, I shall take the liberty of representing to you my
reflections, upon certain things, which I believe to be very useful for the
service of the Elector.</P>

1. It would be desirable that his electoral highness should embrace
every suitable opportunity of publishing, in his conversation, as well as
by the intimations of his ministers, that, since his family is called to the
succession, he is determined to hazard every thing for maintaining his
right, and for supporting those who are truly attached to his interests.</P>
<P>2. As it was very prudent in his minister to act with great reserve and
circumspection, while every thing was in suspense; so it would not be
proper that he should continue his silence, after the ministry here have
given just cause of jealousy. On the contrary, it would be serviceable
that this minister should, from time to time, make suitable representa∣tions
against the attempts which shall be made to the prejudice of the
succession.</P>
<P>3. It will be absolutely necessary to make it known, that the Elector
places an entire confidence in the man who is, or shall be, his minister
here; and that whatever he shall advance or promise in the name of his
master may be depended upon.</P>
<P>4. As it appears, from what I have said above, that all employments
and favours are given to those of the opposite party, I must inform you
likewise, that several persons who have acted very zealously, and who
distinguisned themselves in supporting the succession established by law,
have lost their employments; and as some of them maintained them∣selves
principally by the emoluments which they drew from their em∣ployments
and pensions, I leave you to judge, if it would not be ser∣viceable
to come to a resolution of doing something for them; and par∣ticularly
for those who have titles, and few means to support them. I
speak of some members of the house of peers, and of the advantage of
preserving and augmenting the number of those who are well affected in
that house, which may be done at a very moderate expence, if properly
managed; and unless it is soon resolved to do something of this nature,
I do not see by what means, or in what manner, the bad designs and
measures of the party can be prevented, when the house of peers must
be considered as the principal support of that interest.</P>
<P>5. And since the lives of princes are uncertain, such proper measures
must be taken, on all hands, that when the succession is open, all things
may be disposed for entering immediately into possession. All that I say
<PB N="637" REF="669"/>
here is not only my own opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April—May.</NOTE> but the opinion of others, whom I be∣lieve
to be the most capable of judging, and who are the best affected to
the good cause.</P>
<P>I must add one thing more, which is to renew the caution that was
given to you last year, with respect to our general [Marlborough.] You
must not judge of him by what he says, but by what he does here; and
especially you must not believe him, if he says, that Lord Rivers de∣sired
to leave the service; for it is certain, that he was forced to do so,
for having voted as you would have done, if you had been in his place;
and the sum which was given to him, being but the half of what is or∣dinarily
given for posts of that kind, has been a cloak to conceal their
design and to prevent complaints.”</P>
<P>The following letter seems to convey pretty justly the views of the Scottish
Jacobites in parliament. The writer, however, is mistaken, in the opi∣nion,
that they thought it necessary to change the church government,
before they entered upon their designs in favour of the exiled family.
The overture, for a toleration to those of the episcopal persuasion, was
made by the earl of Strathmore. But it met with so little countenance,
from the Jacobites themselves, that at the requisition of the general as∣sembly,
it was dropt almost without debate.</P>

<DATELINE>London, <DATE>May 18, 1703.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>“SINCE my last, there hath occurred very little material. The par∣liament
of Scotland met, on the 22d, according to adjournment;
and were, all that day, upon controverted elections. It is still said, as I
told you before, that the great business of this session will be, to get a
toleration for the episcopal clergy; and, that this toleration may the bet∣ter
answer the expectation of the court, it is thought there will be some
attempt made for the restoring of patronages; for then it will be an easy
matter to get such persons presented to vacant benefices as will incline to
a change in church-government; a thing the court seems to desire,
though I know nothing that could so much strengthen the Jacobite in∣terest
<PB N="638" REF="670"/>
in Scotland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> but some will say, it is for that very reason the court
desires it; and really, all things considered, it is hard to give any other.
It appears plainly, that the greatest hopes of the Jacobites are now from
Scotland; and that the way they propose to carry on their business there
is, first to have their friends, the episcopal people, brought into church-government;
when that is done, they fancy it may not be difficult to
get the parliament of Scotland to declare their succession in favour of the
prince of Wales; and, if once they gain that point, they resolve to act
a little more barefacedly in England. They will then represent the dan∣ger
of Scotland's having a King of its own, and what mischiefs may
happen to England upon the Scots joining with the English Jacobites.
From thence, perhaps, they may come to urge the breaking into the suc∣cession-act,
and the declaring with Scotland for the prince of Wales, as
things absolutely necessary to preserve the peace of both kingdoms. This
I have ground to think is the Jacobites scheme; and, though I am per∣suaded
they will never be able to effectuate it, yet, considering how
things are managed here, those who wish well to the house of Hannover,
have all the reason in the world to be upon their guard: but more of this
at meeting.”</P>

<HEAD>1704.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1704.</NOTE> which succeeded the revolution in Britain, the
court of St. Germains continued their secret negociations, and
formed perpetual schemes for invading England. But when peace was
concluded, King James, resigning himself to the austerities of religion,
seems to have built all his hopes of restoration, upon the favourable
events which might happen, in the course of time. His servants, how∣ever,
kept up a communication with his friends, more with a design of
retaining them in their principles, than from expectations of their imme∣diate
services. In this situation of affairs, Simon Fraser, well-known
afterwards by the title of lord Lovat, a man who joined insinuating
talents to low manners and a profligate character, came to St. Germains,
and offered his services to King James. Fraser, having committed, in
Scotland, public and private crimes, which threatened to draw upon
him the ultimate animadversions of the laws of his country, had fled
from justice: but his history being known before his arrival, King James,
from motives of morality, rejected his offered services. Having conti∣nued
for some time in a starving condition, in France, he applied, through
a Mr. Carstares, to King William, for a pardon; no doubt, under pro∣mises
of future services. In this pardon, which the principal secretary
of state had refused to sign, either through accident or design, a rape,
which Fraser had committed on the dowager-lady Lovat, had not been
comprehended.</P>
<P>The marquis of Athol, father to the injured lady, prosecuted Fraser
criminally, and he fled again from justice into France. King James was
by this time dead: but the earl of Middleton, who knew his late master's
sentiments concerning Fraser, refused to admit him into his presence.
But Fraser, turning a Roman Catholic, insinuated himself, through the
<PB N="640" REF="672"/>
influence of the Pope's nuncio, into the confidence of the exiled Queen;
and, through the same channel, he had access to the French ministry,
and, it is said, even to the King himself. But the state he gave of the
affairs of Scotland appearing too favourable to the views of the excluded
family to be implicitly believed, Lewis the Fourteenth demanded from
the court of St. Germains, a person who could be trusted to accompany
Fraser into that kingdom, to bring back a genuine account of the state
of things. Fraser, accordingly, in company with captain John Murray,
brother to Mr. Murray of Abercairny passing through England, ar∣rived
on the borders of Scotland, in the summer of 1703. He was met
there, by the duke of Argyle, who had always been his patron, and
conducted by that nobleman to Edinburgh, where he received a pro∣tection
from the duke of Queensberry, commissioner to the parliament
then sitting in that city. Under cover of this protection, Fraser was
sent into the Highlands to extract promises of supporting the pretensions
of the exiled family, from those chiefs and noblemen, who were known
to be in their interest.</P>
<P>Fraser's character was too well known to be trusted. He returned,
with little success, to Edinburgh, and formed a scheme, with the duke
of Queensberry, of accusing several of his own enemies and some of those
of the duke, of a correspondence with the court of St. Germains. But
the proofs which he could produce being insufficient, he was provided
with money and a pass, under a feigned name, by Queensberry, to en∣able
him to return to France to forge or make more complete discoveries.
The famous Ferguson, with whom Fraser had some communications on
his return to London, suspecting his sincerity, had, in the mean time, in∣formed
the duke of Athol, one of the noblemen accused, though he had
never been in any correspondence whatever with the court of St. Ger∣mains,
of the schemes laid to ruin him and others. The noise which
this discovery made in the English parliament is well known. Fraser ar∣rived
at Paris; and, in prosecution of his promises to Queensberry, pre∣sented
the following memorial:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Original.</HEAD>
<P>“AS soon as he arrived in England, he informed himself of the dispo∣sitions
of the people for their King. He found, that, in Eng∣land,
the King had lost much of the inclinations of his subjects, who
pretended to be faithful to him in the prince of Orange's time, because
the princess of Denmark had given employments to those that were ene∣mies
to the prince of Orange; and those, having received better places
than they expect if the King was restored, do not think or suffer to hear
of him, although they have sworn a hundred times, that they would sa∣crifice
their lives and fortunes for him. He marched from London,
with his friend captain Murray and three servants a-horse-back, to go to
the town of Durham, where he must have waited some of his servants
from Scotland with horses and money. He escaped happily to be taken
by a justice of the peace, who arrested his valet de chambre, a French∣man,
because he neither spoke English or Dutch. When he came to
Durham, he found that the town was full of good Catholics of the gen∣try
of the country, who were very faithful to the King his master. As
soon as he was known to be in the town, having been acquainted there
before, all the Catholics came to wait of him, and knowing that he was
in France, as his enemies had published before he was two months in
France, by the information of the princess of Denmark's spies at St.
Germains; all these Catholics made all the protestations imaginable of
their fidelity to the King, their master; and, when he shewed them the
King's picture, they all fell down upon their knees and kissed him and
prayed for him. My lord Lovat answered them, that he did not doubt,
but they loved their King; but that the common opinion was, that the
Catholics in England would be the last that would venture their lives
and fortunes for the King. They answered him, that that opinion was
very false; and that those who made such insinuations to the court were
enemies to the King. Some days after, they made an assembly of all the
Catholic gentlemen of that country; and, after that they had been
some time together, they sent four of their number to my lord Lovat, to
entreat him to inform the Queen, that all the Catholics in the North of
England, who were very numerous and powerful, were ready to venture
<PB N="642" REF="674"/>
their lives and fortunes for the King, whenever his banners should be
displayed in that country, and that they gave already such marks of their
fidelity, that they believed the Queen did not doubt their resolutions to
serve the King. There stayed an Irish nobleman in that town, who was
in the last wars with the King in Ireland. My lord Lovat, finding him
a most loyal sensible man, inquired of him, if any thing could be done
for the King, in Ireland. He told him, that the people were so op∣pressed,
that, if the King of France would send them arms, he would
engage his life and fortune, that he would get fifty thousand to rise in
arms in that kingdom; and he gave commission to my lord Lovat, to
tell so to the Queen and to the court of France; and that he was ready
to receive her Majesty's orders, to go to that country to prepare the
people to that effect.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat continued his journey towards Scotland; and as soon
as he entered the country, his enemies were affrighted, and my lord
Athol, being afraid that, if my lord Lovat took arms, he would destroy
all his estate, made a public complaint to the commissioner, the duke of
Queensberry, and to the council, that my lord Lovat was come from
France, as an emissary from the French court, with money and officers
to raise the Highlands in rebellion against the Queen; and, if they did
not take measures to take the said lord Lovat dead or alive, that no∣body
in the government were sure of their lives or fortunes; he had such
a great interest with all the Highlanders of Scotland. The marquis of
Athol gave to the commissioner, as author, captain James Murray, who
staid so long at St. Germains, and who was in France, and knew when
my lord Lovat received his orders from the court of France. The com∣missioner,
who was always my lord Lovat's good friend, who believed
that what my lord Athol said was malice, instead of giving orders out
against my lord Lovat, sent him expressly his friend, and my lord Lo∣vat's
intimate friend, the earl of Leven, to propose to him, in his name,
and in the name of the princess of Denmark, that, if he would side with
the princess, and enter with him and his friends into the interest of Han∣nover,
that the princess of Denmark would immediately give him her
pardon and his estate; she should pay the debts of his family, and give
him a regiment and a good pension; because they knew his power in the
<PB N="643" REF="675"/>
Highlands, which they feared, and that the Highlanders would do no∣thing
without him.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat thanked the earl of Leven, and intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to thank
the duke of Queensberry, in his name, for his kindness to him: but that
he was so engaged in the interests of his King, and in the interests of
France, that he would never abandon them, till he gave an account of
his journey; and, besides, he thought it his interest never to alter from
the King's side, since he was sure that the King of France would restore
him in a short time. Therefore, he begged of him to consider, that his
family would be ruined and extirpated, when the King came home, if
he did not appear timously for him. He so frighted the earl, with the
King's going home, and the forces of France, that he gave him com∣mission
to make his peace with the King.</P>
<P>The next day, he had an appointment with the marquis of Drum∣mond
and captain Murray, near the ports of Edinburgh. He told them
what the earl of Leven proposed to him. They did not know how to
advise him. He, finding them at a stand, told my lord Drummond,
you see, that those offers are very great; but that he would not take
the whole kingdom of Scotland to abandon the interest of his King and
the King of France, in which he was so solemnly engaged. He pro∣posed
to my lord Drummond, that, if the low country would rise in
arms, he would get all the Highlanders to rise in arms and obey him;
and that, in a little time, they would make an army that would master the
kingdom; and that then he was sure the King of France would send
home the King, and all the necessaries that were requisite to put him on
the throne. My lord Drummond answered him, that he was very willing
to take arms; but that he had not the King's commission. But, as soon
as he got the King's commission, that he would then, without fail, take
arms; and, in the mean time, prepare matters for it; and likewise begged
of my lord Lovat not to go near his own country; since he must take
arms if he went there, which would very much wrong the King's interest.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat, finding that none of the low country would stir, with∣out
commissions; and that the Queen had ordered him expressly, that he
should make no rising, till such time as captain Murray should return
to France, sacrificed his clan and interest for the interest of his King;
and left all thoughts of rising in arms, till he sent an express to France;
<PB N="644" REF="676"/>
because he was afraid, that he and the chieftains of clans that were to
join him, would be suppressed before they got assistance from France.
He told my lord Dummond, that, because he did not think sit to take
arms at that time, the kingdom of necessity must be prepared to make a
general rising for the King; and, for that purpose, he did charge him
to bring captain Murray with him, who was then present, to prepare the
low country, and that he should offer the command of the King's army
to duke Hamilton; and that if the duke did refuse the King's com∣mission,
that would presently ruin him with the King's friends, who were
his support, that afterwards he could not be capable to do any hurt.
My lord Drummond had no good opinion of the duke, nor had any of
the King's friends. But he said to my lord Lovat, that he would pro∣pose
to the duke to take the King's commission; and that he did not
care what he did, since he was sure of people of quality in the low
country without him. My lord Lovat was very glad to hear that from
him; and told him that he would assure him of 20,000 Highlanders,
when the low country was ready to join them, and that he would march
immediately through all the Highlands, except his own country, where
his enemies had garrisons to take up his rents; and that, when he had
assembled the most considerable chiefs of clans, and had shewn them the
King's instructions, he would then send an express for captain Murray,
that he might be present at their engagements and promises.</P>
<P>Having agreed on these resolutions, they parted. The next day, the
earl of Argyle, who was lord Lovat's relation and his great friend, de∣sired
to have an appointment with him, which he, after advising with
my lord Drummond and captain Murray, granted him; and accord∣ingly
they met on the borders of Scotland. Argyle was a subtile man,
and lord Lovat refusing the offers he made him, which were the same
my lord Leven had made him the day before, he told him, that he knew
he was not such a fool as to refuse them, without he had greater things
in hand. He begged of him to let him know them. My lord Lovat,
of necessity, was obliged to dissemble with him; and assured him, that
there was nothing to do: but that, before he came from France, it was
believed that the parliament would either call home the King or rise in
arms for him; and that he came of purpose to raise all his kindred, and
all that would rise with him, to assist him. Argyle told him, that he
<PB N="645" REF="677"/>
did not think that he was so ignorant as to believe, that a protestant
parliament would ever call home a popish King: that, on the contrary,
this present parliament had made an act to exclude the King and the
race, while they were Papists. Lovat answered him, that what the par∣liament
did would not signify a farthing; that, in spite of them and all
his enemies, the King would be home. He, to demonstrate to Argyle
the great force and wisdom of France, and their entire resolution to re∣store
the King, at the same time, exhorted him to consider that his fa∣mily
was very ill with the royal family; and that he must do more than
others to save his person and family from utter ruin: that he was much
astonished, and changed colours, and answered, It's not that that troubles
me. But, said he, I find that the duke of Hamilton plainly designs
to be our King; and before he get the crown, I will be the first
with my kindred that will join the French, and draw my sword for
your prince. My lord Lovat wished that he would continue those re∣solutions.</P>
<P>Argyle asked Lovat, if captain Murray, Abercairny's son, had any
commission from France; because they were told, that he came over
with him, with commissions as a French emissary. My lord Lovat told
him, that he had come over with him, and persuaded him that his only
business was to see his old dying father and his relations; and that, with
what my lord Lovat told the day before to the earl of Leven, was the only
thing that saved captain Murray in Scotland; James Murray and others
having informed against him, as well as against my lord Lovat. Lovat
leaving Argyle very melancholy, took leave of him. Argyle embraced
him, and told him he must be of their party; and that he would work
with the commissioner to that effect. But, at the same time, he took so
to heart what my lord Lovat had told him, that the very next day he
fell dangerously ill, and never recovered it.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat pursued his journey to the Highlands, where they were
overjoyed to see him, because they believed him dead; having been
fourteen months in France, without writing any word to his country.
They came from all corners to see him. He shewed them the King's
instructions, and the King of France's great promises. They were ra∣vished
to see them, and prayed to God to have their King there, and
they should soon put him on the throne. My lord Lovat told them,
<PB N="646" REF="678"/>
that they must first fight for him, and beat his enemies in the kingdom.
They answered him, that, if they got the assistance he promised them,
they would march in three days advertisement, and beat all the King's
enemies in the kingdom. At the same time, my lord Lovat received an
express from lord Drummond and captain Murray, to acquaint him, that his
enemies had obtained an act of the privy council of fire and sword against
his person; and that all the troops in the kingdom had orders to take him,
dead or alive; and that the King's friends begged of him to retire his
person, which was so necessary to the King, to some private place out of
the kingdom, till the King's affairs were ripe. He answered them, by
another express, that he mocked very much what the council could do
against him; and that he was more in safety among the Highlanders, as
the council was within the town of Edinburgh; and that he would pur∣sue
his master's business without any fear; for which reason he sent for
captain Murray to see how unanimously the Highlanders were to take
arms for their King. Captain Murray came and saw the most consider∣able
of the chiefs, and was ravished to see them so resolute for their
King. He told my lord Lovat, that all the low country were well re∣solved
for the King; and that the duke of Hamilton had not refused
the King's commission: but that he desired him to delay matters too
much; so that the King's friends were very jealous of him. He told
him likewise, that all the King's friends had resolved to send my lord
Drummond to France, as commissioner from the low country nobility,
with the chief of a clan, as commissioner from the Highlanders, to assure
the King, their master, and the King of France, how much they were
ready to hazard their lives and fortunes for the King their master, and
for the King of France, if they were assisted by them. Upon which,
my lord Lovat obliged the laird of Appin, as commissioner for the rest
of the Highlanders, to meet with my lord Drummond at his house, to
conclude of affairs.</P>
<P>The day appointed for the meeting my lord Lovat, with the said com∣missioner,
and the laird of Lochiel and other considerable chiefs, came
to the castle of Drummond, and met my lord Drummond and the laird
of Abercairny, captain Murray's brother, the head of a good family,
and very much respected in that country, and one of the loyalest men
in the world. He represented the low country, together with my lord
<PB N="647" REF="679"/>
Drummond. They kept council together there for three days; and,
after several disputes and considerations, it was resolved, that my lord
Drummond and the other commissioners should not go immediately to
France; because it was impossible that they could be out of the king∣dom
but the government must know it; because many spoke already,
that the Highlanders were to rise in arms for King James the Eighth;
and that, as soon as it was known that my lord Drummond was in
France, his estate would be forfeited, which would be hurtful to the
King's interest. But they determined to send my lord Lovat immediately,
because he had no more to lose, his estate being possessed by his enemies,
when he was the last year in France, and because he had the happiness
to have friends, and to be known at the court of France; that he was
more capable to give account of affairs; and that he was the only man
that the Highlanders would trust to make conditions for them. My lord
Lovat, that might have saved his estate and family, by staying in the
country, and seeing that if any accident did happen to him on the road,
his family was extinct, had much trouble of mind to resolve to make
the journey: but, seeing that his master's affairs must have suffered
much, and that he must have failed in his engagements in France, he
resolved to return with their commission to give account of affairs, or to
die by the road. Upon which, he was sent away, with his cousin, cap∣tain
Fraser, who was with him all the time, with letters to the Queen,
the marquis de Torcy, and to the Nuncio, from my lord Drummond,
the laird of Appin, as commissioner from the rest of the chiefs, and
from captain Murray. It was likewise resolved, that captain Murray
should stay for a little time, to go with my lord Drummond to a part of
the low country, where he had not been before, to bring marks with
him of their resolutions to rise in arms for their King; and that, as soon
as he came back to his father's house, he should come immediately to
France, with a son of one of the chiefs of the clans, to confirm what my
lord Lovat should say in their name.</P>
<P>At that time, my lord Drummond, with the laird of Appin, should
come to London, and there wait the King's orders, if it was necessary
that they should come to confirm what Lovat and captain Murray said in
name of the kingdom. My lord Lovat, who spent already much of his
own money, borrowed four hundred pounds from lord Drummond and
<PB N="648" REF="680"/>
the earl of Leven, and took journey with his dispatches. The com∣missioner,
who had still hopes to gain him to his party, sent him his pass∣port
some time before, to come into Edinburgh. He made use of it,
on this occasion, and came in and saw the commissioner, and gave him
very fair language; so that he gave him his passport to come to London,
to receive what he had offered him, in the name of the princess of Den∣mark.
Though he neither trusted him nor his passport, he was glad to
have it, in case he met with some of the troops on the road. Having
staid some days at Edinburgh, being tender, he rode, in the night-time,
through Scotland and the north of England, till he came to Durham,
where he staid some days with the King's friends, who confirmed what
they had said before he went to Scotland. He was forced to buy fresh
horses there to carry him to London, because he durst not take coach or
post for fear to be known.</P>
<P>In seven days after, he arrived safe in London, where he found ex∣treme
difficulties in leaving England; no man, woman, or child being
suffered to go to Holland, without Nottingham's pass. He had no ways
to procure it, but by Queensberry, which obliged him to hazard to go
and see him privately. Queensberry received him kindly. He told his
Grace that, in honour, he must go back to France: but, as soon as he gave
account of his journey, he would return and accept of his estate and the
offers his Grace made him: that, therefore, he begged of his Grace to
procure him Nottingham's pass to go to Holland, since there was no∣body
that could go without it. He answered, that he was very sorry,
that he was resolved to go back to France: that he could not have such
an occasion of establishing his family; and that he could not give him
the same offer, though he should come again. However, he told him,
that he must go back, though he should never get either of them.
The duke then told him, that he could not get him a pass in his own
name, because he was declared a rebel: but that he would endeavour
to get a pass in an unknown name; and that he would send it to him
the next day. My lord Lovat thanked him very kindly, and then took
leave of him. Yet the duke regretted that my lord Lovat did not em∣brace
their party.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat went, that very night, to Gravesend, being afraid to stay
any longer in London, all his enemies being there. He left orders with his
<PB N="649" REF="681"/>
landlord to follow him with the pass, next day, which he did; and, by
that means he went safely a ship board. In two days, with a favour∣able
wind, he arrived in Rotterdam, where he was forced to stay fifteen
days to wait his bills of exchange, which should come by the common
packet-boat; and though all that time he informed himself how he
might get safe into Flanders, yet he found it almost impossible to leave
that country without the States pass. He met Mr. Delaval there, and
sent him and others to the Hague to offer money for a pass; but could
not obtain it by any means. This stay, that he was obliged to make at
Rotterdam, did give him occasion to do considerable service to the King,
by gaining several of the Scots officers of his friends and relations, who
were going to Scotland to make recruits. They swore faithfully to him,
that they would join the King's banner, whenever he should have any
army in the country; and some of them promised to let down their com∣mission
and live at home to wait for that occasion.</P>
<P>His bills having come, and having despaired of a pass, he ventured
to go to the Bosh, a frontier town, where some of his friends lay in gar∣rison;
hoping that they might assist him in getting out of that country.
He no sooner arrived there, but some of his kinsmen that were there
knew him, and above a hundred of them having come to his lodgings
next morning, to tell him that they would follow him wherever he went,
the report spread through all the town, that he was come there to de∣bosh
the garrison to the French. He, finding the great danger he
was in by that report, resolved to leave the town that afternoon. He,
accordingly, slipt out in the evening, and gave twenty pistoles to a guide,
that furnished a horse for himself, and two horses for my lord Lovat and
his brother, and engaged to conduct them safe, that night, to Antwerp.
My lord Lovat, leaving captain Fraser and his page behind, ventured
with his brother and that guide to ride the fifteen leagues to Ant∣werp
all night, which he did, and missed narrowly a Dutch party who
were within pistol-shot of him, on the Spanish territories. But their
noise having advertised them, he galloped a league off the high-road,
through the moor; and arrived, by seven o'clock in the morning, at
Antwerp, where he met with the Mareschal de Villeroy, who was very
civil to him, and directed him to go safe into France; where he is
<PB N="650" REF="682"/>
happily arrived, to give this account of his journey, and of the affairs
of his country, to your Majesty.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat forgot to give an account, that, about two days
after he came to the country, he sent his cousin-german, Sir John
M'Lean's brother with a letter to the earl of Breadalbin, concerning
the King's affairs. He returned him answer, by the same bearer, that he
was always loyal, and that he would live and die so; but that he would
not trust himself to any man in the kingdom, on such great concerns,
except to my lord Lovat; so that, if he pleased to come disguised to his
house at Ballach, he would be free with him upon that subject. Though
the journey was very dangerous, yet my lord Lovat, knowing that the
earl of Breadalbin was of the greatest consequence to the King's affairs,
he hazarded his life very desperately, in going in disguise through my
lord Athol's land, to the earl's house at Ballach, where we had long con∣ferences
with him; and, after many difficulties, he at last persuaded him
so much to embrace the King's interest, that he is resolved to obey their
Majesties orders, and to hazard his grey hairs in the field for his master.
He likewise, after a vast difficulty, persuaded him to see my lord Drum∣mond
and captain Murray, upon the same head.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat likewise forgot to give an account, that in Scotland
he gained several officers of his relations, that are in the standing forces,
who promised faithfully to him, to come off and join the King's banner,
whenever he did appear in Scotland.</P>

<P>“THE impatient desire I had to see the King, my master, and the

<P>“I Have the honour to send you the account which lord Lovat has
given to the Queen. The original is written with his own hand,
and signed with his name; and I venture to assure you, that the transla∣tion
is exact, and even literal. I doubt not but you will be as much
surprised at it as we have been: for, although you know I never had a
good opinion of him; yet I did not believe him fool enough to accuse
himself. The informations given against him, by others, are out of the
question; and it is unnecessary to fatigue you with an infinite number of
remarks, because every thing is explained in his own memorial. He has
not, in some places, been as careful as authors of romances, to preserve
probability. For, besides the vanity which runs through the whole, as
if he himself were the first man in the world, he begins with a story at
Durham, which is totally false. He acknowledges plainly a formal dis∣obedience:
for he was absolutely forbidden to treat with any, but the
Highlanders; and only with such among them as had sent him.</P>
<P>He told me, that Queensberry, Argyle, and Leven, were the greatest
enemies of the King, my master, in that country; yet he communicated
to them the whole of his commission, which is a crime that deserves
hanging in every country. He rejects extraordinary offers; but obtains
a pass to go to London, and from thence the same Queensberry obtains
another pass for him, under a borrowed name, to secure his safe return
to France. This is very true: for he has produced them. It is, therefore,
clear as day-light, that these noblemen wanted to employ him here as a
spy, and for seizing letters and commissions, which might serve as proofs
against the men of honour in that country. You will be pleased to ob∣serve,
Sir, that, in his own report, he makes every one ask commissions,
in order that he might obtain now what was refused to him last year.
He accuses none, but James Murray, who is a man of such known pro∣bity,
that my lord Arran called for him as a man in whom he could
<PB N="653" REF="685"/>
place the greatest confidence: but foreseeing that Mr. Murray's account
would not be favourable to him, he chose to be before hand with him.</P>
<P>If the King thinks proper to apprehend him, it should be done with∣out
noise. His name should not be mentioned any more; and, at the
same time, all his papers should be seized. He has a companion called
Fraser, who has attended him every where. I know nothing more about
him.”</P>

<P>Fraser,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> who took to himself the title of lord Lovat, wrote a long let∣ter
to the earl of Middleton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. fol. No. 52.</NOTE> on the nineteenth of January. He was
afflicted, he said, with the gravel, and the queen's suspicions of his con∣duct
added to his distemper. “If it is personal virtues,” says he, “that
are only esteemed, and not services, if her Majesty, before she believed
any thing of me, would be so just as to examine or inquire impartially
<PB N="654" REF="686"/>
into my way of living; if I may not be called devout, I am sure her Ma∣jesty
will find, that I never was given to any vice, and that what my
enemies said of me was a designed and interested calumny.” He then
repeated his having been sent to France with a commission from the
Highlanders, and his having rejected the offers of good posts in the go∣vernment,
and restitution of his whole estate, in case he would abandon
the cause, in which he was determined to persevere to his death, though
he endangered “the entire entinction of his family, there being none to
represent it but his brother and himself, who were exposed to the daily
hazard of their lives.” He was afraid, that the queen inclined to ma∣nage
his enemies: “But,” says he, “I cannot understand where the
balance lies, betwixt the family of Athol, a branch of the Murrays, who
cannot bring fifty of its name to the King's service, and who were trai∣tors
from their origin to this moment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Yet he pretended to have brought a letter from the exiled Queen to that nobleman, wherein she owned his past loyalty and expected his future services. The letter, however, was written to another, though Fraser gave it to Queensberry, as intended for Athol.</NOTE>, and the family of Lovat, which
has lost more men in defending the royal family of Stuart than there are
Murrays in the kingdom of Scotland; and which, I bless God, can at
this time bring a thousand Frasers, well armed, in four and twenty hours,
to the King's service.” To this, and a great deal more in the same
strain, the earl of Middleton returned the following answer:</P>

Nairne's hand, were sent to the nuncio and the French ministry.</P>

<HEAD>“Remarks on Lord Lovat's answers sent by the Queen to the Nuncio.”</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">“QUESTIONS and ANSWERS.”</HEAD>
<P>“QUESTION I. LORD Lovat was asked the names of the Catholics,
whom he saw at Durham, and particularly of that
Irish lord, who engaged to raise five thousand men, in his country, for
the service of the King of England?”</P>
<P><PB N="657" REF="689"/>
“ANSWER. He answered, that he is ready to tell their names to the
Queen: but that they exacted from him, to ask her Majesty's royal
word, that she would not tell them to any one. With regard to the
Irish lord, that he did not say that it was in his power to raise five thou∣sand
men: but that there were in Ireland five thousand Catholics ready
to take arms for their King, whenever they should be sent to them;
and that he was ready to go to Ireland to prepare them for that pur∣pose.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“With regard to his answer to the first question, the ministers of the
court of St. Germains remark, that, in an audience he had of the Queen,
and in several letters which he wrote to her, he made no mention of this
secrecy about names, which he now pretends to have been required of
him; and that it is absolutely incredible that all the Roman Catholic
gentlemen of a county, in which they are obliged to observe so many
precautions, should venture to assemble, and to send four deputies to
lord Lovat, when they were not acquainted with him but as a passenger,
and could not know but from himself whether he was a Roman Catholic
or not; and that they should be so inexcusably imprudent, as to trust
themselves so publickly to the discretion of a man who was an absolute
stranger to them; while, at the same time, they were so absurdly cau∣tious,
as to distrust the queen's council, and to exact from her Majesty,
on her royal word, that she should not tell their names to any one.</P>
<P>With regard to the Irish lord, the question is not whether it was actu∣ally
in his power to raise five thousand men; but whether lord Lovat
said, in his narrative, that he had engaged to raise them. Now here are
the very words of his own narrative, with which he may be confronted
at any time. He positively affirmed, “that this Irish lord,” whose name
we are not allowed to know, “had charged him to tell to the Queen of
England, and to the court of France, that if arms were sent to Ireland,
he would engage his life and his fortune, that he would find there five
thousand men who would take arms for the service of his Britannic Ma∣jesty.”
They leave the French ministry and the nuncio to judge, if a
man does not say, “that he engages himself,” when he says, “that he
engages his life and fortune.”</P>
<P><PB N="658" REF="690"/>
“QUESTION II. He was asked, if he believed that the earls of Argyle
and Leven, and the duke of Queensberry, were well or ill-affected to his
Britannic Majesty?”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. He answered, that these noblemen, of whom one is dead,
were, are, and will be, for or against the King of England, as they find
their interest in it.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“This answer is vague and delusive, Lord Lovat dared not own
plainly (what, however, is very true) that these noblemen are very ill-affected
to his Britannic Majesty, because that he would subscribe thereby
to his own condemnation, for having had such an intimate correspond∣ence
with them without orders; and, on the other hand, he dared not
say that they were well affected, because he would be contradicted, by
what is publickly known, and would likewise contradict himself: for
he owned to the Queen, that these noblemen were enemies to the King
her son, which is very different from his ambiguous answer to the ques∣tion
that was put to him. Now these ambiguities and contradictions are
not incident to those who adhere to truth.”</P>
<P>“QUESTION III. He was asked whether he communicated to these
three lords what he should have carefully concealed.”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. He answered, that he told them nothing which he should
have concealed from them: but that, on the contrary, all that he told
them tended to conceal his real design; having said nothing to them, but
what had been first concerted with the principal friends of the King, his
master, as he hath most fully explained already.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“The ministry of the court of St. Germains observe, that the reverse
of this appears evident from Lovat's own narrative. Lord Leven came
to him from the duke of Queensberry, before he could have concerted
that meeting with the King's friends. They had only his own word to
oppose to all the presumptions against him, that he did not accept of the
offers, which were made to him. He was sent to the Highlanders, and
should have treated with them only; whereas, his first conferences in
Scotland were with his Majesty's greatest enemies. They then quote his
own words to the earls of Leven and Argyle, and to the duke of Queens∣berry,
as expressed in his memorial to the Queen. They make many
<PB N="659" REF="691"/>
pertinent remarks upon them; and conclude with observing, that “such
discourses should naturally have induced the duke of Queensberry to ar∣rest
him, instead of allowing him to go away, if he had had no better
assurances from him; yet the contrary happens: for, not satisfied with leav∣ing
him at liberty to go away, he assists him to leave the kingdom, which
gives room to conclude, that, according to all appearances, lord Lovat dis∣covered
and promised to these noblemen more than he acknowledges here,
otherwise they never would have presumed to encourage him so far, or in∣clined
to furnish him with money and passports to facilitate his return to
France.”</P>
<P>“QUESTION IV. He was asked, what services these lords required
of him to deserve rewards so considerable, as those which were offered
to him?”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. That they made these offers to him, without exacting any
other conditions from him, to secure themselves from the just apprehen∣sions,
with which James Murray had filled them, that he, Lovat, would
put himself at the head of the Highlanders, with the other chiefs, his
relations and friends, and carry all the rest of Scotland along with them.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“The ministry remark, that these lords knew Lovat too well to fear
him; and that their characters are too well known to be suspected of
having made such offers to him, without exacting any return. They
confute what is laid to the charge of James Murray, from his known
character of prudence, honour, and loyalty. James Murray was then at
St. Germains, and protested to the Queen, not only that he did not
speak to these three noblemen while he was in Scotland, but that he never
filled them nor any other with a fear of lord Lovat; and that he was as∣sured,
by a man who knew the state of the country and deserved to be
credited, that Lovat was so far from having the power which he pre∣tended
in the Highlands, that he could not now raise fifty men of his
own clan.”</P>
<P>“QUESTION V. He was asked, since he had rejected their offers, by
declaring his inviolable attachment to their enemies, by what motive was
he able to engage them to protect him; and to furnish him money and
passports to secure his return to France?”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. He answered, by motives of the old friendships, which
they had always for him, to such a degree as to furnish him with a retreat
<PB N="660" REF="692"/>
and subsistence for six or seven years, when he was proscribed for having
taken arms for the service of the late King; and because they, as well
as he, are the enemies of the earl of Athol.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“The ministry make many remarks on the improbability of supposing
that these noblemen, whom Lovat himself represents in his memorial as
very selfish, could be carried to such lengths by their friendship for him.
They were at the head of the government in Scotland, when he was con∣demned
for an atrocious crime, as he pretends. They did not protect
him then, as they had not probably the same motives of friendship to
him they have now. Lovat did not take up arms for the late King of
England, unless, by the late King of England, he meant the late prince
of Orange, who made him a captain in lord Athol's regiment.</P>
<P>“QUESTION VI. He was asked, if he designed to remain here or to
return?”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. He answered, that he came back to offer, in the name
of the principal men in Scotland, both in the Highlands and in the low
country, to take the field with an army for the service of his King, and
to return to expose his life with them for his re-establishment.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>The ministry remark, that he brought no proofs of his having been
employed to make these offers, but letters of recommendation in very
general terms, from lord Drummond, a Highland gentleman, and captain
John Murray, dated in the month of October, that is to say, two months
before the discovery of the conspiracy. “But to answer more properly
to the question,” they observe, “he should have said, that his design
was to remain here, until he obtained the succours necessary for his en∣terprise:
for if he had no need of succours, why did he return? He
should have remained in the country and carried on his projects, since
he could dispose of Scotland himself, and of Ireland, by means of his
powerful friend at Durham. He did wrong, to delay the pleasure which
we should have received from this.”</P>
<P>“QUESTION VII. He was asked, why he disobeyed the orders which
he had, not to speak but to the Highlanders who had sent him?”</P>
<P><PB N="661" REF="693"/>
“ANSWER. He answered, that he did not speak at first of his real
design, but to those who had sent him: but that, as they had drawn
over several of the principal noblemen of the low country to the King of
England's party, and as, among these noblemen, there are some who
have lands in the Highlands, he could not and he ought not to have
avoided to confer with them, conjointly with his old friends and the ser∣vants
of the King their master, by whose advice he conducted himself in
all he did.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>“It is but too evident, though in a very different sense from that in
which lord Lovat would chuse that we should understand him, that he
did not speak of his real design, but to his old friends, who had sent
him. But to hear him speak of his old friends, would not one be apt to
say that he was fifty years of age; yet he acknowledges himself that he
has been at college after the revolution; therefore, his ancient friend∣ships,
of which he boasts so much, did not commence but after the re∣bellion,
and with men who were then declared rebels; and it is not diffi∣cult
to guess, by what means he has deserved their esteem. It is always
a very great prejudice against a man, that he acknowledges for his best
friends the greatest enemies of the King his master; and to allege that
friendship, in his justification, is a pitiful defence.” They make seve∣ral
other remarks, on his disobeying his orders, not to confer with any
but the Highlanders.</P>
<P>“QUESTION VIII. He was asked the names of the Highlanders with
whom he treated?”</P>
<P>“ANSWER. He answered, that he had no power from them to tell
them, but to the Queen upon her royal word, not to name them to her
council; because they had experienced how little these regard secrecy,
and how much they themselves have suffered thereby.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>The ministry deny this charge, which Lovat had more than once re∣peated
against them; and they conclude with remarking, “That it is a
proof of his impudence, rather than of his innocence, if he presumes to
remain longer in France. He flatters himself, that he will obtain here
all he wants. He knows, that if he returns empty handed, he will not
<PB N="662" REF="694"/>
be well received by his old friends: for he is convinced, that their pro∣mises
were conditional, and that he will have no right, on his return, to
demand the performance of them, unless he brings with him money,
commissions, and all the other proofs which they expect from him, to
render their new plot credible, and to put them in a condition to revenge
themselves of their private enemies, by sacrificing all the friends of his
Britannic Majesty. In short, it is certain, that this plot hath already
been a reason for seizing several good subjects in England and in Scot∣land;
and there is great reason to believe that the consequence would
have been more fatal, if the earl of Athol had not hastened the disco∣very
of it, contrary to the intention of the duke of Queensberry, who,
according to all appearances, designed to wait for lord Lovat's return.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“The Sieur James Murray, lately arrived from Scotland, has declared
to the Queen, and given under his hand and seal the following particulars
concerning the Sieur Beaufort, commonly called lord Lovat.”</P>
<P>“I Remember, that soon after the arrival of Beaufort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lovat.</NOTE> in Scot∣land,
the late earl of Argyle went towards the borders of England,
under pretence of going to a country-house which he has near Newcastle.
But I am assuredly informed, by men who deserve to be credited, that he
did not go so far, and that he was only at some place in that neighbour∣hood,
where Beaufort waited for him, and where they staid together some
days. The parliament being then prorogued for eight days, on account
of a meeting which the deputies of the boroughs were to hold at Glaf∣gow,
that they returned together to Edinburgh, where Beaufort was in∣troduced
to the duke of Queensberry; and that his Grace gave him a
pass to the Highlands, to treat with the chieftains about their taking
arms. In fact, some of those with whom Beaufort treated, were dis∣covered;
and, before I left Scotland, there was an order to apprehend
lord Drummond and Appin, and several others were summoned to ap∣pear
before the council.</P>
<P>It is well known in Scotland, that the duke of Queensberry gave to
Mr. M'Leod, a lieutenant of the Scotch guards of the princess of Den∣mark,
bills upon the bank of Scotland for 400<HI>l.</HI> sterling: that these
bills were carried to the bank; and that Mr. M'Leod received a hundred
guineas from one of the tellers, and two hundred from another; and
that he declared to the council, and signed his declaration, that he gave
that sum and the rest of the bills to Beaufort, by order of the duke of
Queensberry. The said Mr. M'Leod declared also, that Beaufort had
told him, that Mr. James Murray was sent from St. Germains to treat
with the duke of Hamilton and his party, which is commonly called in
Scotland the country party; and that he was to return to St. Germains
soon; and that the Queen of England had sent three letters to Scotland,
<PB N="664" REF="696"/>
by Mr. Jo. Murray, who came from France along with him; one to the
duke of Gordon, another to the countess of Errol, and a third to a
person whose name M'Leod says Beaufort had told him, but which he
has forgot. All these declarations of M'Leod's are registered in the
records of the Scotch council.</P>
<P>It is certain, for I have been informed of it by good authority, that
the earls of Argyle and Leven said, that Beaufort told them, that be∣fore
he could engage the court of St. Germains to enter into his pro∣jects,
he was obliged to make himself a Roman Catholic; after which
they listened to all his proposals, by the means of the duke of Perth and
father Saunders.</P>
<P>I am assured likewise, that Beaufort told in Scotland, that there was
one of the name of M'Kenzie in France, who disconcerted all his schemes;
and, before he could succeed in what he proposed at Versailles and St.
Germains, he was obliged to contrive to have him put into the Bastile.</P>
<P>Men who deserve to be credited, who were upon the spot, and who had
an interest to know every thing, wrote from London to a nobleman of
the first rank in Scotland, when I was there, that the duke of Queens∣berry,
in an audience which he had of the princess of Denmark, had ac∣knowledged,
in the presence of the earl of Athol, that he had given a
pass to Beaufort to go to the Highlands of Scotland to treat with the
chieftains; and that he had the permission of the princess of Denmark to
do so, which she acknowledged; and that his Grace had said also, that he
had procured a pass for Beaufort to leave England; and that he did so
to give him an opportunity of rendering them greater services.</P>
<P>It is certain that there was a letter from Beaufort to the duke of
Queensberry intercepted by lord Athol, in which Beaufort acknowledged
all the duke's favours, and promised to continue to serve him.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbel of Glenderuel, when he was examined, declared, that he
gave another letter from Beaufort to the duke of Queensberry; and,
upon the duke's denying to have received that letter, Campbel, who per∣sisted
to maintain that he had given it, added, that he could still show
the letter which Beaufort wrote to him, and in which the duke's letter
was inclosed. But, as the duke was not willing to produce that letter,
the contents of it could not be known.</P>
<P><PB N="665" REF="697"/>
I had an opportunity of conversing about Beaufort with one Adam∣son,
known to be a very honest man, who has suffered much for his
loyalty, and who is now receiver and manager of the estate of Lovat
for the lady, who is the heiress and eldest daughter of the late lord
Lovat. This man, who is perfectly acquainted with that country, as∣sured
me, that Beaufort had now so little influence there, that, excepting
forty or fifty adventurers, men like himself, ready for any undertaking,
because they had little or nothing to lose, he would not find one High∣lander,
even of his own clan, who would willingly follow him.</P>
<P>In fine, the most considerable of the friends of the King my master,
in the low country of Scotland, with whom I had the honour of con∣versing,
and whose sentiments I had an opportunity of knowing, consider
Beaufort to be a man so wicked, so dangerous, and so notoriously to be
suspected, that they will be much astonished, if he is not punished in
France, where they cannot apprehend how he has ventured to return,
after the manner in which he conducted himself in Scotland; and, in
short, they are persuaded, that when his real character, his conduct, and
his little influence in Scotland, where he is outlawed for detestable crimes,
are a little known at St. Germains, they will take care not to send back
such an emissary as will ruin the affairs of his Britannie Majesty in that
country, by disobliging his firmest friends, and those whom it is most his in∣terest
to manage, and who certainly will never choose to expose themselves
to treat about any affair with the court of St. Germains, while they sus∣pect
that that court can place any confidence in Beaufort, whom they
consider as a man capable of betraying and ruining them.</P>

Torcy, the 22d February,</HI> 1704.”</Q>
<P>“The Sieur James Murray who is come back from Scotland, where
he had been sent back with instructions to the earl of Arran and several
other noblemen, and others of his Majesty's faithful subjects in that
country, has given the Queen, in their name, the following narrative.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“THE earl of Arran, at the expence of great attentions, a good deal
of intrigue and application, and large sums of money, which he
laid out during the sitting of the last parliament of Scotland, managed
matters so properly, as to gain among them a party strong enough for
disconcerting the principal designs of the court, especially with regard to
the three chief articles, which I was charged, by my instructions, to recom∣mend
to him; namely, to hinder the parliament from consenting to the
union of the two kingdoms, the abjuration of his Britannic Majesty, and
the settlement of the succession in the line of Hannover. It was by these
means, that the power which had been given to the commissioners to
treat about the union was declared to be expired; that the Hannoverian
succession was rejected; and that the bill for the abjuration was not even
proposed in parliament.</P>
<P>Besides, his party voted unanimously for all the clauses in the act for
the security of the kingdom, which was considered as a positive exclusion
of the duke of Hannover; and, when the whole act came to be con∣sidered
for the last time, his party was so powerful, that the act was
passed by a great majority of voices; and, because the princess of Den∣mark
refused afterwards to give her consent to it, the same party hin∣dered
the reading of the bill for the subsidy; and, thereby, obliged the
commissioner to prorogue the parliament before any subsidy was granted.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran employed all imaginable means to oblige some of
the princess of Denmark's ministers, namely, the lords Athol and Tarbar,
and the chancellor Scafield, to enter into his measures, with regard to
the three articles above mentioned; and he prevailed with them so far,
that they resolved to represent to the princess of Denmark, that they
could never serve her effectually in Scotland, unless she concurred with
<PB N="667" REF="699"/>
them in yielding these three points. If these noblemen persist in their
resolution, and if the princess consents to what they shall demand of her,
it is not doubted but she may be prevailed upon, in time, to make some
treaty in favour of the King her brother. If she does not consent, but,
on the contrary, persists in the design of carrying these three points in
the ensuing parliament, then there is room to believe, that she will meet
with so much opposition, and the divisions and animosities will be so
great, that it will not be difficult to engage the parties, which they call
the country party, to make some declaration, or undertake some enter∣prize
in favour of his Britannic Majesty.</P>
<P>But, before they come to the last resolution of this kind, the earl of
Arran demands to be made acquainted with the friends his Britannic
Majesty has in England, upon whom he can depend, in order that he
may concert with them, and that they may condescend together, upon
the succours that will be necessary for them.</P>
<P>He has given me in charge to tell, that the parliament of Scotland
will meet again in the month of April next, or in the month of May
at farthest; and that, if the princess of Denmark designs, as it is be∣lieved
she does, to engage the Scots in the same measures with England,
with regard to the succession, the abjuration, and the union, she will
certainly send money to be distributed among the members of parlia∣ment.
Now, in order to counterbalance this, he desires, that 25,000<HI>l.</HI>
be sent to him.</P>
<P>The manner in which he proposes to dispose of this money is, to take
a share of it to himself, to assist him to defray the great expence which
he will be obliged to make for maintaining his credit with his party; to
distribute another share of it in augmenting and strengthening his party,
and in preserving and confirming those who are already of it, according
as he shall see necessary for the service of his Majesty; and to employ
the rest in purchasing arms. With regard to the manner of placing
this money in London, he leaves that to the discretion of his Britannic
Majesty, as well as the choice of the person to whom his Majesty may
see fit to trust it. But it is his opinion, that the trustee should be rather
a man who is unknown, than a man who is known; and, when the
money is placed, and the person who is to keep it condescended upon,
<PB N="668" REF="700"/>
lord Arran desires to have notice of this, and to be made acquainted
with his cant name and his address, in order that he may write to him,
and he will write only two words to him, with which two words he hath
trusted me, and told me that the Queen of England knows them; and,
upon showing these, he wishes that person may be authorized to pay
the money.</P>
<P>My lord Arran proposes likewise, that, during the meeting of par∣liament
in Scotland, endeavours should be made to have some troops and
some ships in readiness on the coast of France, in order to be at hand
in case they come to a rupture. I had orders likewise to represent to
his Britannic Majesty, that it is the opinion of lord Arran, that all the
enterprizes which do not succeed, tend to ruin the affairs of his Ma∣jesty,
and to destroy his friends; and, for that reason, that nothing
should ever be undertaken, but upon good foundation, and after mat∣ters
were properly concerted, and all the necessary measures taken for
procuring success.</P>
<P>And this is not the opinion of my lord Arran alone, but also of all
the King's principal friends in Scotland, with whom I have spoken, and
whose names I have given to the Queen; the archbishop of—, the
bishop of Edinburgh, the lords Panmure, Stormont, Balmerino, and
Montrose. They all spoke to me, nearly in the same manner, on this
subject; that is to say, that an enterprize, supported by powerful suc∣cours
from France, and well concerted with the friends of his Britannic
Majesty in England, as well as in Scotland, would find the country
greatly disposed to second it: but that a precipitate and rash attempt,
instead of succeeding, would serve only to ruin every thing.</P>
<P>And it is for this reason, that the earl of Arran insists much, that a
correspondence may be settled between his Britannic Majesty's friends in
the two kingdoms, in order that they may the better judge what suc∣cours
will be necessary for them; and he offers to treat of the affairs of
the King, his master, with any of his Majesty's friends in England, pro∣viding
they can be prevailed upon to be the first to speak about them
to him: but, until he knows what he may hope from England, he
says, that he cannot precisely determine what succours will be necessary;
because a greater or a smaller number will be necessary, in proportion to
the number and quality of the people in England who will join him.”</P>

happiness of hearing from you, or from my lord Middleton, I cannot
help writing to you again, to assure both you and him of my respects;
and, at the same time, to inform you of the intelligence sent to me,
concerning the late Scotch plot. I am informed, that Fraser of Beau∣fort,
alias Lovat, has been at St. Germains; that he has been well re∣ceived
by some persons there; and that he has been afterwards at Ver∣sailles,
where he says that he has received money, with a promise of re∣ceiving
more, together with troops, when it is necessary. Now, it is
<PB N="670" REF="702"/>
certain, that he has been sent by the duke of Queensberry, and that
the expence of his journey is defrayed by his Grace, in order to form
a pretended conspiracy against the present government of Scotland, and
to involve in it the dukes of Hamilton and Athol, and lord Tarbat, se∣cretary
of state: but his principal design was to ruin the two first of
these noblemen, and, above all, the duke of Athol, who is the mortal
enemy both of the duke of Queensberry and of Beaufort, because the
latter had ravished his sister in the most infamous manner. Those who
wish no good to the court of St. Germains, rejoice at this; and they
have reason: for nothing does greater prejudice to the service of his
Britannic Majesty, than the reception given to such villains, who have
neither credit nor power. Believe me, there are none but villains and
beggars, and men capable of rapes, who would come with such ill-founded
projects; and such men ought to be considered as spies, and be
confined in mad-houses if they are fools, and in the Bastile if they have
their senses.</P>
<P>I gave the character of this Lovat, long ago, to madam Fox; and
I likewise gave notice of several other emissaries of the same character
with this man, who formerly deceived the court of St. Germains. But
they did not choose to believe me, until it was too late. I acknowledge
I am too warm when I speak about Lovat; because I know that nothing
can be more prejudicial to the interest of the King our master, than to give
him credit; being very certain, that he has been sent to France, by the
duke of Queensberry, in order to ruin his enemies in Scotland, and to
dress up a plot which might render his Grace agreeable to both kingdoms,
and give him a triumph over his enemies.”</P>

payment of the old debt [restoration of the family of Stuart], that it
will be good without going to law [without a war]. Mr. Armsworth
[Marlborough] hath made many promises of that nature, but hath still
pretended inability when pressed to make them good. I hope, at this pre∣sent,
he may find himself more able, and no less willing, to perform, at
least in some reasonable time, his engagements, and dispose matters so as
that Hanmer's [Hannover's] affair may be no obstruction to it.</P>

<P>“I Could not have answered sooner the letter which you did me the
honour to write me, concerning the little vessel designed for Scot∣land;
because I have but just now learned the name of the man who
must necessarily be employed. He is a native of Scotland, and pilot
<PB N="673" REF="705"/>
of the King's frigate called the Ludlow, an English prize, now at Dun∣kirk.
He knows the place where he ought to land, which is called the
castle of Bownes, the residence of the earl of Errol, in the county of
Buchan. It will be sufficient, if this vessel can be ready on the 10th
of the next month, with orders to sail as soon as they receive their dis∣patches,
and to return immediately after they arive at the place of their
destination. To keep this scout, it is necessary to give him his orders
sealed, with a prohibition to open them till he is at sea, or to carry any
one along with him, who does not belong to the ship. The Scotch
pilot, of whom I speak, is called Caron, a name which would frighten
a scholar; but sailors do not study the belles lettres.”</P>

would be a danger in her remaining on the coast, for fear of giving
alarm: and as the place is distant from Edinburgh, an answer cannot be

remain a few hours on the coast, to take this man on board again, and bring

the marquis de Torcy, to whom he takes the liberty to explain himself
again, by this memorial, fearing not to have done so sufficiently by his
letter; because, as he always believed that this Caron, who is a pilot,
was of the ship's crew, he might imagine it was demanded, not that the
ship should stay to take this man again on board, but another man who
was to bring an answer to the packet.”</P>

<P>“YOUR last gives fair hopes that Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough],
who is the principal person concerned, hath renewed his pro∣mises
of payment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 12.</NOTE> [of restoring the Stuarts] in so convincing a manner
to you, that you cannot doubt of his performance. I rely much upon
your judgment in this matter, and shall always hope the best; though,
to tell you truly, I cannot well see how his promises can be much stronger
or more binding now, than they were many years ago, when they proved
ineffectual, and seemed in a manner forgotten. All I can say is, that I
have no other reason to be satisfied of the reality of his intentions, but what
you give me in your last letters, wherein you say, that at your first confer∣ence
with him you was convinced of his upright meaning. If you receive
the same satisfaction when you meet with his partner Goulston [Godol∣phin],
it will give a more promising face to this business; for that part∣ner
is not so free of his promises as Armsworth [Marlborough] has been,
and consequently not to be so much suspected of non-performance.
However, no overtures ought to be neglected that are made us, of hav∣ing
our debt fairly satisfied, without the expence and vexation of being
tossed about from the law to the chancery, and from thence perhaps to
the house of lords. Their transactions with Northly [Scotland], will,
perhaps, give us some light into this matter; for if they join in interest
with Mr. Hanmer [Hannover], we may conclude their intentions are not
right towards us.</P>

<P>“LORD Churchill, some days before his departure for Holland,
sent for me, and made me so many promises, and gave me so
many proofs of the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itude of his intentions to discharge the debt,
which he has acknowledged long ago to be due to your family, that I
can entertain no doubt of his sincerity. He appears to me to be asto∣nished,
that the duke of Berwick was sent to Spain, and employed at
such a distance; and he asked me how you could consent to that. I told
him, that you had written to me formerly on the subject, and that his
being employed in a post so considerable, would assuredly be very ad∣vantageous
to the common interest: but I perceived, that he believed
that he would have been more useful in the place where he was last year.
He ordered me likewise to go sometimes, in his absence, to wait of my
lord Godolphin, and to communicate to him any important intelligence
I might receive concerning you and your family.</P>
<P>Mr. Floyd is very zealous in the affairs of your family. He likewise
has waited lately on lord Churchill, and he has entreated me to acquaint
you, that his lordship had given him all the promises and assurances
which he could either hope or expect from him, of his intentions to pay
the debt. In short, I am daily more and more convinced of the pro∣bability
of the good success of our affairs; and the misunderstanding
which reigns here, between the leaders of parties, contributes not a little,
in my opinion, to give us room to hope for a favourable issue.”</P>

the clamour of those persons who, upon private interest of their own,
show themselves against it. Nor can we doubt of Mr. Serely [French

friendship to Manly [the King], and have the credit of setting him up
in trade. For you remember what he did towards it, upon his father's
death, which made such a noise among the adverse party; and you will
the more wonder at it, when I tell you what I certainly know, that he
made that step against the opinion of his timorous advisers [the French

them who was zealously for it, and carried the point. Those that con∣sulted
him, at that time, were afraid of the lawsuit that might ensue;
having to do with quarrelsome neighbours. But a just and generous

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>“ON my arrival in London, I found there my nephew, Mr. Keith, a
gentleman of a family very loyal to the King of England. I
established a correspondence with him. My lord Lovat, knowing that I
had seen him, desired to see him likewise; and, as he was well versed in
the affairs of England, I believed that he might have been useful to the
interests of his Majesty, both in England and in Scotland. He certainly
would have been so, if he had not been betrayed.</P>
<P>As soon as business allowed me, I left London, and came as far as
Durham, with lord Lovat, where I left him, and went from thence to
Edinburgh. As soon as I arrived there, I sent for my brother-in-law,
Graham of Fintrey, and my uncle, James Graham, both of them men
distinguished for their loyalty. They soon gave intelligence of this to the
marquis of Montrose, to the earl of Errol, and to his son, lord Hay;
and as I came to Scotland upon the indemnity, they advised me to give
notice of my arrival to the lord Commissioner; and they assured me
that that would be of no prejudice to me. I accordingly did what they
advised me. All this time I did not speak a word of business; having
had orders from the commissioner to keep my room: but, after some
days, both he and the chancellor sent me word, that I was at liberty;
and then my friends above mentioned advised me to visit them all, one
after another.</P>
<P>The earl and the countess of Errol, with their son, lord Hay, being
then at Edinburgh, were the first to whom I spoke of the affairs of the
King of England. I went, after that, to see lord Drummond, at his
country-house, Drummond-castle, from whence he came back with me
soon to Edinburgh, to serve his Majesty, after I had enjoined my two
eldest brothers, in the country, by the advice of lord Drummond, to in∣form
<PB N="678" REF="710"/>
themselves of the state of affairs in that quarter, in such a way as
not to make a discovery to any body.</P>
<P>Speaking at Edinburgh with the King's friends about his Majesty's
affairs, in a more serious manner than I had done before, I found that
these affairs had not been mentioned among them for a long time before,
and that it was to them an agreeable surprise to see some hopes that they
were to be revived by my negociation.</P>
<P>It was then judged necessary to communicate the business to the duke
of Hamilton, who entered into it very heartily: but, as the project was
new, and other business came in the way, the duke of Hamilton, princi∣pally,
and the duke of Gordon, the earl of Errol, lord Drummond, and
lord Hay were of opinion to put it off until they saw what turn affairs
would take in parliament, in order to act accordingly afterwards with
the King's friends in England: but when the sittings of parliament were
finished, his Majesty's friends dispersed in such a manner, that it was im∣possible
for me to speak to as many of them as I proposed. Yet, as the
business was not to be delayed, it was judged proper, that lord Drum∣mond
and lord Hay should speak to the rest; and all those who were
spoke to were overjoyed at the project, viz. the dukes of Hamilton
and Gordon, the marquises of Montrose and Drummond, the earls of
Errol, Marishal, Moray, Hume, Strathmore, Panmure, Breadalbin, and
Aberdeen; the countess of Seaforth, who answers for the vassals and de∣pendants
of her son in his absence; the viscounts Stormont and Kenmure;
the lords Salton and Sinclair; Sir Donald Mac Donald, the captain of
Clan Ronald, Lochiel, Glengary, Appin, Keppoch, and Bethadie for
the Mac Gregors.</P>
<P>Some time after I had left lord Lovat at Durham, he thought proper
to acquaint the earl of Argyle, that he was on the borders, and to ask
him his protection in the country, under pretence of making his peace
with the government. The earl of Argyle having granted him this, he
went to the country of Argyle and, soon thereafter, sent for me thither,
to introduce me, according to my orders, to the Highland Chieftains.
I repaired thither instantly; but did not meet him, because he had been
obliged to withdraw himself from that country, where he began to be
suspected: yet my journey to that country was not useless; for I spoke,
there, to Lochiel, Appin, and Bethadie. About this time, the parlia∣ment
<PB N="679" REF="711"/>
had just finished its sittings; and, a few days thereafter, lord Lovat
came to Edinburgh, where lord Drummond and he had an interview;
and it was then that lord Lovat saw the duke of Queensberry and the
earl of Leven. He gave notice of this to lord Drummond and to me,
and showed us the necessity under which he was to act in that manner.</P>
<P>At this time, all the noblemen and gentlemen returned to their coun∣try-seats;
and, it being impossible for lord Lovat to remain any longer
in the country, because there was an order to prosecute him, with fire
and sword, he was advised to return to France. But, before he left Scot∣land,
he was at Drummond-castle, where we met some Highland chief∣tains,
who engaged themselves to have one of their number ready at the
time I should return to France, to come along with me, in order to de∣clare
how well disposed they were for the service of their King. But the
great noise which the plot made soon thereafter prevented that. It was
at Drummond-castle that lord Lovat got the letters, which he carried to
this country from lord Drummond, from Appin, and from me. Soon
after this, I went to the North of Scotland with the lord Drummond, to
see such of the King of England's friends, in that country, as I had not
yet seen; and, just when I was ready to set out with my dispatches, I
was retarded by the news of the discovery of the plot. His Britannick
Majesty's friends wished very much, that a few troops had been sent to
Scotland, at that time, which would have made all the country rise, so
many of the Highland chieftains having been summoned before the
council. It was then the month of September; and, since that time, I
have been always waiting for a safe opportunity of returning to France:
yet, before I left Scotland, I had fresh assurances from all the King's
friends of their firmness in his Majesty's interest, as the letters which I
have brought do testify.</P>
<P>To speak now of the terms, which the King's friends in Scotland de∣mand,
for taking arms: the general opinion is, that it is necessary to
have 5000 men from France, with good officers to command them, pro∣visions
for as long a time as shall be found necessary, arms for 20,000
men, and money to buy saddles, bridles, and other necessary accoutre∣ments
for mounting a proportionable number of dragoons, which will be
chosen out of the 20,000 men.</P>
<P>If I am asked how those 20,000 men can be raised, I answer, that
there is no body, who knows the country, but will allow, that the duke
<PB N="680" REF="712"/>
of Gordon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> the earl of Errol, and the earl Marishal, can raise all the
North; that the marquises of Montrose and Drummond, the earls of
Strathmore, Panmure, and Breadalbin, and the viscount Stormont, the
greatest part of the South; and the Highland chieftains, above men∣tioned,
the Highlands; insomuch, that one may venture to assure, that,
moderately speaking, the number required will be found in these three
divisions.</P>
<P>With regard to knowing, whether the King of England should go
over himself to Scotland, in the beginning or not, opinions are divided
in this respect. Some say, that his presence is necessary; others that it
is not proper to expose him in the first confusion; but all agree and say,
that his Majesty's presence will have the same effect as an addition of
10,000 men to his army. But they leave this, and every thing else that
concerns this project, to be determined here.”</P>

<P>The ministers of the court of St. Germains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa∣pers, D. N. vol. ii. fol. No. 12. And vol. viii. 4to. No. 19.</NOTE> encouraged by the intel∣ligence
they received from their adherents in Britain, began to think
again of an invasion; and, in a memorial, presented on the twenty-second
of June, this year, to Mons. de Torcy, and Mons. de Chamil∣lart,
of which a copy likewise was sent to the Pope's Nuncio, they en∣deavoured
to show, that it was the interest of France to establish the son
of the late King James on the throne of Great Britain. All Europe, they
observe, having measured their strength with France, found that their ef∣forts
would be ineffectual, without the support of England: that this
was the reason of the resolution taken, in consequence of the league of
Augsbourg, to attack the late King of England, as the firm and faith∣ful
friend of his most Christian Majesty: that France would be invin∣cible,
in conjunction with a nation so powerful and bold, which now
comprehended the Rhine and the Mediterranean within the sphere of
<PB N="682" REF="714"/>
its operations; but that this union could never take place, without the
re-establishment of the King of England: that the family of Hannover,
which was powerful of itself, and attached to that of Austria, would, if
once in possession of England, form, in conjunction with Holland and
the empire, a perpetual league against France. To obviate an objection,
which, it seems, had been frequently made, that the King of England,
when re-established, might, through ingratitude or necessity, break his en∣gagements
with France, and forget his obligations to its sovereign, they
observe, that a Catholic King in Britain must be always dependent on
France. They prove this, by several reasons, which they frequently re∣peated
to the French ministry: and as the facility of establishing him on
the throne of his ancestors, was more universally allowed, than the faci∣lity
of the means, they endeavour to show, that the invasion and re∣duction
of Britain was a thing very practicable. The late Mons. Bart
frequently declared, that he would engage, whenever the King would
choose to employ him, to carry over twenty thousand men, and that this
was more practicable now than ever.</P>
<P>“The loyalty of the greatest part of the Scots,” say they, “is too
well known to require proofs; therefore, five thousand men would be
sufficient to engage all that country to take up arms, as appears from the
report of Mr. John Murray. But twenty thousand men would be em∣ployed
more usefully in England, because the passage to that country is
shorter, and the blow would be more speedy and decisive: for the pos∣session
of that country would soon draw the two other kingdoms after it.
All the opposition to be met with in England would be some guards and
a few new-raised troops dispersed in weak forts, in the distant parts of
the kingdom; with a weak princess, a very timid minister, and a very
mercenary general, whose heads might probably turn giddy, in such a
critical conjuncture as that would be; and who might then think of per∣forming
promises they had so often repeated, in order to deserve their
pardon and other advantages.”</P>
<P>They show, finally, that the most proper season for a descent would
be the month of March, before the fleet of the enemy could be equipped:
that a descent would prevent its being fitted out: that the funds of the
preceding year would be exhausted and the treasury empty; and that no
one would be foolish enough to lend money then upon an uncertainty.
<PB N="683" REF="715"/>
They observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> that there is nothing to hinder troops, after they landed,
from marching straight to London; and that the possession of that city
would secure the possession of the rest of the kingdom.</P>

<P>“COncerning Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough], we need say no more,
than what we have both already said; but respite our judgment
concerning them, till we see further proceedings of him and his. I think
some prognostic may be made of what we can expect, by the countenance
and expressions of Mr. Goulston [Godolphin], when you next meet him.
If they are any thing of a piece with what Mr. Armsworth [Marlbo∣rough]

and sometimes the princess Anne] and of Mathews [the King] are
the same; and that one cannot subsist well, without the other. I take
Mr. Trevers [Tunstal] to be as knowing and able a merchant as any
that comes upon the exchange, and perhaps a degree honester than some
we have to deal with; and his opinion is of great weight and advantage,
especially if he and his partner, who are considerable, shall act conform∣ably
to it. Wherefore you will do well, not to omit any opportunity of

<P>“I Wrote to you, upon the 22d last, my own opinion and Mr. Short's
[Gideon] of the gentleman Mr. Spence [Fraser] against whom I al∣ways
wrote, though he pretends to you to have made me his confident.
I told you likewise, that the aunt [lady Errol] looks on him as a villain,
though the nephew esteems him yet an honest man. G. Milton [Gideon]
is still in this country, but afraid of coming hither for fear of his credi∣tors.
He has written to Capel [Mr. Hall] to meet him at Kirkaldie.
The gentlemen of this country are daily breaking. The lairds of Bel∣namoon
and Boyne are both broke, and each of them reckoned above
100,000 merks worse than nothing; so take notice to whom you advance
any money. There came lately a fleet, not from your town, Amster∣dam,
but from Rotterdam, in which our government got notice there
were suspected persons, and so seized upon them as soon as they landed;
to wit, Sir G. Maxwell of Orcharton, who the Gazette, six months ago,
said was become a jesuit, and one captain Livingston, who was lately ba∣nished
out of England, and Gordon, a factor at Paris, or I do not know
where. The first two are yet in close prison; the last was immediately set
at liberty upon bail, which makes some think he has made discoveries.</P>
<P>Your niece Mary is one of the notablest husseys in this country. She
deserves a compliment and advice sometimes from Sir James [the Queen].
Our parliament sat down on Thursday last; but was immediately ad∣journed
till Tuesday next, without the reading of the Queen's letter, or
the commissioner or chancellor making their speeches, which seemed new
and surprising to all. 'Tis thought the reason of all this is, because the
letter and speeches used to contain the commissioners instructions and
reasons of the meeting, which is to be kept private till it be proposed,
at least during this adjournment of six days, when the country-party
would have been contriving their arguments against it.</P>
<P>The most part of our nobility are for Hannover, especially the new
come in courtiers, as Tweedale, commissioner, converted by his son Yes∣ter,
<PB N="685" REF="717"/>
Rothes, Roxburgh, Haddington, and Jerviswood, converted by se∣cretary
Johnston, now lord-register, the most violent Hannoverian of any
Scotchman. He is sent hither ambassador for that effect, not from Han∣nover,
but from the English Hannoverians. Were it not for Hamilton,
it would certainly carry; but he works wonders against it. His two
brothers are against him, for which their mother is highly displeased, and
favours her eldest son's designs. He counts upon thirty of the nobility
for him, besides some boroughs and the most part of the barons. Mon∣trose
sticks closest to him. Athol is violent against Hannover, though
it is suggested to him, he ought, at the same time, oppose the prince of
Wales, because of his kindness to Beaufort. His brother, my lord Nairn,
is coming in, that he may vote against Hannover; and Sinclair, Oxen∣ford,
the master, now lord Balmerino, with others ready to come in, if
there be need for them. 'Tis reported, that because Johnston threat∣ened
to bring in Glenco's murder, to hinder this, the Dalrymples are to
join with D. Hamilton, in opposition of Hannover, upon his promising
to hinder the plot from being examined. Leven will join with him
against Hannover. I hear likewise, that Salton, in odium of Johnston,
will oppose Hannover. It is thought, that Seafield, having wrote to
court, that he believes Hannover will not carry, will not be too violent
for him; but of him and Tarbat it's hard to make a judgment. We have
accounts of the duke of Bavaria's leaving the French interest, and of the
loss the French and Spaniards have had of late every where; but some
look upon this as forged news, to cause our parliament to enter into the
English measures. We have had ringing of bells and firing of cannon this
afternoon, for a great victory the Emperor has got in Germany over the
French. We are astonished to hear that Mrs. Jackiline [James Murray]
is less noticed than John Milton [John Murray]. All here, especially
Lady Mary, think her very far beyond him, and that more credit ought
to be given to her than to him. Queensberry is indisposed, so cannot
come down to this parliament; yet it is believed, he is as much in the
Queen's favour as ever, and will be restored to all his places before it
is long.”</P>

they recommend so heartily Mr. Davis [Hannover] to Mr. North [Scotch
parliament], and have employed this new set, on that condition; and,
though they desire nothing more than to destroy the hearing, yet they
will expect it should be well explained by what means it can be per∣formed.
'Tis most certain, no body could so well negociate this affair

<HEAD>1704.</HEAD>
<P>THE first letter in the Hannover correspondence of this year regards
the Scotish plot, which has been mentioned so often in the Stuart
Papers of the same period. Queen Anne, in her letter to the parlia∣ment
of Scotland, which met at Edinburgh on the sixth of July, recom∣mended
to them the settling the succession in the protestant line. A strange
distinction made use of by the earl of Cromarty, one of her ministers,
about her Majesty's <HI>revealed will,</HI> raised, with other circumstances, a sus∣picion
that her <HI>secret will</HI> was very different. A resolve for a treaty with
England, in relation to commerce and other concerns, and for such li∣mitations
and conditions of government, as might secure the religion,
liberty, and independency of the nation, prior to the nomination of a
successor, was carried in parliament by a majority of fifty-five voices; of
whom thirty were the servants of the court, and supposed to act accord∣ing
to the orders which they had received. The Queen was obliged, be∣fore
she could obtain any supply, to give the royal assent to the act of
security; by which it was provided, that, in case her Majesty should die
without issue, the parliament, if not then sitting, should meet and de∣clare
a successor to the crown, who should not be the SAME PERSON that
was possessed of the crown of England, unless, before that time, there
was a settlement made in parliament of the rights and liberties of the
nation, independent of English counsels.</P>

<P>“I AM very much obliged to you, for the letter you wrote to me on
the 5th instant, and for your having been pleased to communicate
to me your thoughts on the operations of the campaign in the empire.
They appear to me very solid, and perfectly suitable to the good of
the common cause. I doubt not but, with the divine assistance, we may
flatter ourselves with a glorious success; such a salutary plan formed and
conducted by a general, whose good intentions and knowledge are so well
known. The interview which you propose with the margrave of Baden,
and the countenance which the enemy will show, when you approach them,
<PB N="691" REF="723"/>
must enable you to judge what you ought to do, and to determine to
take measures as just as the importance of the business requires.</P>
<P>I imagine, my lord, that the cities you specify may furnish nearly the
heavy artillery necessary for a siege. It would be proper to concert this
with the Elector of Mentz, who, being one of the directors of the circle
of Franconia, may contribute greatly, by his influence, to enable you to
provide yourself. But lest you should be disappointed, it would be
proper not to depend upon finding, in that country, the horses and car∣riages
necessary to transport this artillery from place to place. It would
be surer, therefore, to furnish yourself with them before-hand. It is still
more certain, that you will find neither powder nor ball in that country;
and the indispensable occasion which you will have for them, should in∣duce
you to give, in time, positive orders for transporting a sufficient quan∣tity
of them, it being otherwise impossible that you can execute any thing
considerable against an enemy who can, very easily, avoid a battle, and
reduce you to a necessity of forming a siege, or of passing all the season
of the campaign uselessly. I am not without some hopes that the mar∣grave
of Baden, by reinforcing the army of general Thungen, by de∣tachments
from the army, which is in the lines of Beihl, may hinder the
junction of the reinforcement which France designs for the Elector of
Bavaria, and that, upon your arrival, the situation of affairs may be still
the same▪ But you will, no doubt, judge it very necessary to hasten your
march, with all possible dispatch, left you should give time to the enemy
to make any progress before you are at hand to prevent them. Prince
Eugene, who will come to command the army of Franconia, will, on
his side, do every thing that is possible for him, in order to act in con∣cert
with you, and to second your operations effectually.</P>
<P>I have sent to that prince, and to the Margrave of Baden, the inclosed
memorial, which an emissary of France, taken in this country, was em∣ployed
to carry to the mareschal de Marsin. This piece will shew you the
designs of the enemy against the empire, and the places where they pro∣posed
to act offensively, while they keep upon the defensive in others.
You are too penetrating not to see the use which may be made of this
intelligence, and the necessity of keeping it a secret.</P>
<P>I wish, my lord, the happy success of this campaign may advance the
glory which the preceding has procured you: in this I interest myself very
<PB N="692" REF="724"/>
particularly. I shall always have a very sensible pleasure in showing you

<P>THE contests between the Whigs and Tories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705. January.</NOTE> which had subsisted
in the last season, rose to an extraordinary height in the begin∣ning

to the public were forgot in the private concerns of their leaders. The
Tories, in particular, from whom the court of St. Germains derived their
chief hopes, were more intent upon annoying the Whigs, than on for∣warding
the views of the pretended prince of Wales. This circumstance
renders the correspondence of the present year uninteresting. Yet it ap∣pears,

<P>You will perhaps wonder when I tell you that your friend Armsworth

<PB N="696" REF="728"/>
the more to be wondered at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> because they had not seen one another in
God knows how many years before. The gentlewoman herself tells me,
that their conversation, especially on his part, was all in general terms;
and that, when she descended to some particulars, his answer was, that
he would do what honour and justice obliged him to do, without parti∣cularizing
any thing.</P>
<P>The adherents of the excluded family, always ready to grasp at every
incident, that seemed to favour their own views, had their eyes fixed for
several years past upon Scotland; where a jealousy of England, which
assumed the name of spirit, had raised extraordinary heats in parlia∣ment.
They might, however, have been convinced, that, when the
duke of Hamilton insinuate to them, that money was necessary to con∣firm
the fidelity of those who pretended to be attached to their cause, that
the continuance of the ferment, upon which they had built their hopes,
depended entirely upon those who managed the treasury of England.
The lord Godolphin, terrified by the Whigs, made use of the weight
of his office to influence the affairs of Scotland; and, before the end of
the session, he managed his power with so much success, that an end was
put, at once, to the noise of the country party, and to the designs of the
cavaliers. Several of the latter, who probably foresaw, that they could
derive no hopes of accomplishing their views by an opposition in par∣liament,
transmitted the following intelligence to St. Germains, with a
design to induce France to undertake an invasion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<OPENER>It is dated 23 March, O. S. 1705.</OPENER>
<P>“WE have a great difficulty here to concert our measures together;
for it would be much easier for us to find many to be sent to
you, than to reduce them to two or three. But I doubt not but all those
who shall be sent, will agree in general to the following articles; namely,
that it is necessary to send hither a sufficient force, and to send it in the
way which will suit you best; and as it does not appear to be very prac∣ticable
to transport a sufficient number of troops, as far as Scotland, it
is thought that it will be more convenient to land them in some port in
England, which may be condescended upon as the most convenient and
nearer to you.</P>
<P>The computation which is commonly made of the number of troops
that must be sent to render the enterprise successful, is about 10 or
12,000 men, which must be sent at the same time, in case they are sent
to Scotland; but, if it is judged more proper to land them in England,
in that case, besides this number, it will be necessary to send 3000 men
more to this country, for protecting the King's friends, who will declare
for him here, and for putting them in a condition of sending succours to
the troops which shall have landed in England.</P>
<P>Arms are demanded for 20,000 men: but, if money enough is sent
in time, to enable the people of the country to arm themselves, a smaller
quantity of arms will be sufficient. With regard to terms between the King
and his subjects, I do not believe it will be very difficult to settle them.
It will be always necessary to send a plausible declaration, in which his
Majesty will promise to redress the grievances of his subjects, and to re∣fer
himself to a free parliament, for rectifying the abuses and the illegal
proceedings of the present government. It will be necessary to promise
likewise to send a supply of money sufficient to support an enterprise of
this nature; and, in the mean time, it would be of great advantage, if
money to buy arms could be sent immediately; for, both in the south
of the kingdom and here, they are very desirous of being armed; but
<PB N="698" REF="730"/>
the misfortunes of the times have impoverished the generality of the
people, to such a degree, that it is impossible for them to furnish them∣selves
with arms, at their own expence, so speedily as they would wish;
and if some small sum could be deposited in the hands of some persons
of confidence, who would distribute it honestly and with prudence and
discretion, among the King's friends in this country, for managing his
Majesty's interest, that sum, employed to that purpose, and managed
with discretion, would render more service to the King, in the present
conjuncture, and advance his affairs farther, than six times the sum on
any other occasion.</P>
<P>This is what is expected from you, and, with the blessing of God, and
such assistance as is now demanded, there is not the smallest doubt, but
the enterprise will succeed. But, if you send a smaller number of troops
than is mentioned above, it is the general opinion, that that will only serve
to ruin all the friends which the King has in this country at present;
and to prevent any attempt to be made, for a long time, for the service
of his Majesty in any of his kingdoms: for, besides the security and
encouragement which a sufficient force will give his friends here, it will
induce those who are neuter to join them, and force their enemies to
submit. Whereas if the body of troops which is sent, is not sufficient
to make the proper exertions, all those who are neuter, and who love
their ease, and these are very numerous, will stay at home; and it is cer∣tain
that his Majesty's enemies will oppose, with all their force, any body
of troops which they may hope to vanquish. Therefore, both the King's
friends and the foreign troops, which will come in small numbers to their
assistance, will come only to be ruined all at once, which God forbid;
or to involve themselves in a long and destructive war, the issue of which,
in all probability, will be fatal.</P>
<P>These are the sentiments of people here on this subject. I leave to those
who are more interested in the case, to determine what they have to do
on this occasion. The absence of lord Arran, whose return we expect
every minute, and the expectations from the approaching parliament, are
the reasons which have prevented us from sending hitherto the persons
expected from us.</P>
<P>The bearer of this is in a hurry to set out; therefore I can say no
more to you at present. I shall only add, that it is absolutely necessary
<PB N="699" REF="731"/>
to send some money to keep up the correspondence, and to carry on
our affairs with more expedition. For those who have hitherto furnished
that expence, are not now in a condition to continue it, on account of
the bad payment of their farmers and other accidents. A sum of thirty
thousand livres, placed in good hands, and managed faithfully, would
be of greater utility here to the King's service than you can imagine. In
short, without this small supply, it is absolutely impossible to advance
our affairs.</P>
<P>The following extracts explain themselves. It seems that, though the
duke of Marlborough and the lord Godolphin had no intentions of tak∣ing
an active part in favour of the excluded family, they still continued
their professions of attachment, and promises of future services. It is
difficult to say what could induce them to continue their intercourse with
the agents of the court of St. Germains, unless they were from principle
attached to its interests.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters, continued.</HEAD>
<P>“WHAT you say to me concerning what passed in your last meet∣ing
with Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough],<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Caryll's Letters, vol. v. fol. Scotch College.</NOTE> though it be but a
repetition of what I formerly heard to be said by that merchant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> yet, at
this time, I confess it is very surprising to me: for very few men will
lye only for lying's sake, but for some profit or advantage. Now, con∣sidering
the present flourishing condition of that merchant, and his cre∣ditors
want means, more than ever, to go to law with him, it would be
very strange, if he should make such promises and protestations, without
any intention of performing them. On the other side, words are but
wind, when they are not followed by deeds; and when they clash, the
one by the other, the man must be judged by his actions. It is true,
that what he formerly told you in Norley's [Scotch parliament] affair
came to pass, that nothing should be done in the favour of Hanmer
[Hannover] to our prejudice; but whether that was brought about by
any industry of his, or rather not against his will, remains still in the
dark. According to all outward appearances, he and his partners did
then, as they do now, drive on violently for the interest of Hanmer
[Hannover]. So that to explain this riddle, we must see what will be
<PB N="700" REF="732"/>
done at Norley's [Scotch parliament] next meeting; which will be a
crisis to determine our judgment in this matter.”</P>
<P>“You also further enlarge in yours of—,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 14.</NOTE> what passed between you
and Armsworth [Marlborough] when you last met, adding that parti∣cular
of his liking the pound of tea with which you presented him. But
I do not like the answer he made, when you doubted whether it would
be agreeable to his wife's palate; he said he could see faults at home,
but they would be soon over. Now, this is a plain confession of his
wife's present not relishing the tea, in which he is to be believed. But,
on the other side, I cannot believe that he and his wife have a different
palate; and therefore fear that what he unawares confessed of his wife's
relishing, is too sure an indication of his own. We shall thank provi∣dence
if any good comes from him: at the worst, it is good, at least, not
to be deceived. The pound of tea which captain Gordon desires for his
great friend, will be sent you by the first opportunity.”</P>
<P>“I must also own the receipt of yours of the 3d of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 30.</NOTE> wherein you
relate what passed between you and Mr. Goulston [Godolphin]; which
merchant is not so prodigal of his words as his partner Armsworth
[Marlborough], and therefore they are somewhat more to be relied upon,
and, unless they both join to deceive, much may be hoped from their
agreeing both in the same story.”</P>
<P>“I did believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> that the credit of Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough]
would not be kept up so high as formerly, in regard of some disappoint∣ments
he has lately met with. Yet I am told he has newly had a lucky hit,
which may possibly set him up again as high. Be it as it will, there
are many who will still think he is more fortunate than honest.”</P>
<P>“It must not be denied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 23.</NOTE> but that Armsworth's [Marlborough's] pre∣diction,
made not long since to Berry, concerning Norley's [Scotch par∣liament]
affair, proves true; and there is reason to hope, that what has
fallen out is the effect of his good intentions; but that point must be
cleared by his subsequent actions.</P>
<P>P. S. I cannot omit telling my apprehensions, that although it was in
the power of Armsworth [Marlborough] and his partner Goulston [Go∣dolphin],
with the assistance of Goldeny, to have carried their cause in
the behalf of Hanmer [Hannover] at Norley's [Scotch parliament] trial,
<PB N="701" REF="733"/>
yet I doubt whether the true and only cause of their so not doing, was
not in prospect of keeping on foot the trade of their friend Sharp and
his dependants, after the lawsuit should happen to be ended between
Manly [the King] and Wheatly [England]; for they possibly may have
great need of such a friend, at that time, to stand by them, for the sup∣port
of their own trade and credit.”</P>
<P>“Men's minds must be strangely altered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10.</NOTE> if Mr. Heyden [Tories] and
his friends make it their business to have Mr. Hanmer [Hannover]
amongst them, in opposition to Gilburn [Godolphin], Armsworth [Marl∣borough],
and Wanly's [the Whigs] friends. It looks as if all things
tended to a confusion amongst them, out of which I pray God send order
may follow.”</P>
<P>“I am in your debt for two of your letters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 22.</NOTE> In the first, you promise
me a farther account of Mr. Heyden's [Tories] disposition, in reference
to Armsworth [Marlborough], Goulston [Godolphin], and partners,
which also, in your last, you have put off to a further time. I hear, from
other hands, what you have said in general, that Heyden [Tories], in
conjunction with Kensy and his company, are preparing to commence a
suit against those other merchants, for interloping and double dealing
with Mr. Norley [the Scots] in Hanmer's [Hannover's] negociation,
alledging that it was in those first merchants' power to have carried the
cause in behalf of Hanmer [Hannover], which failed through their wil∣ful
neglect, whatever appearance there was to the contrary. I believe
this may stick hard upon Goulston [Godolphin] and Armsworth [Marl∣borough];
for had they, at the trial, produced the evidence of Goldeny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Money, probably.</NOTE>,
which they might have done, the verdict, in all likelihood, would have
gone for our friend Hanmer [Hannover]. But as they brew so let them
bake; which is all I have to say in the matter.”</P>
<P>“I am much of your opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 19.</NOTE> that Mr. Heyden [Tories] and Renzy's
project of siding with Hanmer [Hannover], comes from a motive of
revenge, rather than of interest or inclination; but what it will produce
time must shew, as well as how the difference will end between Norley
[Scotland] and Wheatly [England]. A certain gentlewoman, whose name
I have forgot, but Mr. Gawin, who I believe is in town, can tell it you by
<PB N="702" REF="734"/>
this mark; for she came over in company, or about the same time, with
Crofton's [Middleton's] former clerk, who was brought into trouble, and
was much talked of at the time. Now, this woman says, that some of
your cousin Wisely's [Queen's] tenants have made offers to pay in pre∣sent
a year's rent, and also some arrears, and be at the charge of the
law, if your cousin Wisely will renew their leases: for, it seems, they
have refused to pay their rents to the present occupants, lest they should
pay them twice. I suppose Mr. Gawin may be acquainted with this wo∣man;
therefore you may desire him to inquire further into this matter.
Mr. Rose has formerly hinted something of a like nature, and probably
this woman and he may have conferred notes together about it. There∣fore,
if you think it convenient, you may take some occasion of conversing
with him about it. You may be sure the tenants are well satisfied that
your cousin Wisely's title is good in law, or else they would not make
these offers.”</P>
<P>“I am informed our old acquaintance Mr. Ar. Blake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably the duke of Hamilton, who was now supposed, by the Jacobites, to be
trimming with the other side.</NOTE> intends to leave
Norley's house [Scotland],<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7.</NOTE> and remove to Wheatly's [England], with
intention to make fair weather, if he can, with Young [princess Anne]
and his partners, and to discover whether there be any private corre∣spondence
between those merchants and Plessington [the King], of which
he has formerly had some suspicion, as I think you may remember; and
I guess, that if he can find it to be so, he would willingly strike with
them, and join stocks with them in that trade. But if he cannot dis∣cover
that they are so inclined, I believe he will quit that thought, and
join with them (if admitted) upon their own terms. He is so cunning
a dealer, that I believe they will be afraid of him, and hardly take him
into their company. However, this I can assure you, that your kinsman
Plessington [the King] has not given him the least indication or ground of
surmise, that there is any correspondence or joining of stocks between
him and Mr. Young's partners [princess Anne's ministers].”</P>
<P>“I am of your opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15.</NOTE> not to move in that other business of your
cousin's jointure as yet, though all that is pretended should be true;
your reasons for not doing it so soon being very good. And whether it
will be worth your while to consult Mr. Goulston [Godolphin] about it
<PB N="703" REF="735"/>
at present, must be further considered. In the mean time, you will have
leisure to find out upon what grounds those tenants of your cousin are
asserted to be disposed to return to her.”</P>
<P>“As to what relates to the tenants of the widow's jointure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 30.</NOTE> I am fully
of your opinion, for the reasons you mention, that nothing ought to be
stirred in it till Easter-time be over, and till we see how another lead∣ing
cause will be carried. I am of opinion that your friend Mr. Heyden
[Tories] has received of late so little encouragement towards the carry∣ing
on his great designs, that he will cool in them for the present, and
expect a better season.”</P>
<P>“I find that we differ not in opinion concerning Mr. Blake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke of Hamilton.</NOTE> and his
manner of proceeding;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 7.</NOTE> and think it will be necessary that you should
intimate to our partners, that he has been more than once curious to
know whether or no they are in any intelligence with Mr. Plessington
[the King]; and, moreover, to assure them, that Mr. Plessington [the
King] has never satisfied his curiosity on that point, nor given the least
ground to surmise, that there is any correspondence or joining of stock
between him and Mr. Young's partners [princess Anne's ministers]. You
may take the time which you shall judge most convenient to represent
this matter to those partners, which you will do, I suppose, before Mr.
Blake comes to town.</P>

<HEAD>HANNOVER PAPERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1705.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the eventual succession of the family of Hannover had
been provided for, by the act of settlement, their mounting the
throne was still a matter of great uncertainty with the nation. The
state of things, however, was changed before the end of the present
year; when the Whigs, who had held forth the protestant succession as
the main object of their principles, had got possession of the chief power
in the kingdom. Before that period, the letters to the court of Hanno∣ver
were merely official or complimentary, and contained little informa∣tion
with regard to the nation.</P>
<P>To explain the Hannover papers, under the head of this year, it may
not be improper to premise a brief account of the events which they con∣cern.
Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Prussia, only daughter of Ernest
Augustus, Elector of Hannover, and of the princess Sophia, died on the
first of February, in the present year. George William, duke of Zell,
uncle and father-in-law of George Lewis, the reigning Elector, died also
on the eighth of August, in the eighty-first year of his age. George
Augustus, the Electoral prince, married, on the second of September,
Wilhelmina Caroline, daughter of the marquis of Brandenburgh An∣spach.
The correspondence of the year consists chiefly of answers, sent
by the Elector, his mother and his son, to letters either of condolance or
congratulation, on events in which their family was so much concerned.
These letters were originally written by Robethon, and afterwards tran∣scribed
from his draughts, by the electoral family.</P>

<P>“THE news of the important advantage which you have obtained
gave me a very sensible joy. I am much obliged to you for the
trouble you have taken to inform me of it. The manner, in which this
enterprize has been concerted and executed, does you so much honour,
that those who interest themselves in what concerns you as much as I do,
must derive a double satisfaction from it. I expect important consequences
from it for the good of the common cause, whose interest, as appears
more and more every day, cannot be in better hands than yours. I wish
you, with all my heart, a continuance of success and an augmentation of
renown; and am truly, my Lord, &amp;c.”</P>

<P>“I Am very sensible of the obliging manner in which you interest your∣self
in whatever gives me joy or pain. You are in the right to be∣lieve,
that I have felt, in a most sensible manner, the loss we have sus∣tained
by the death of the duke of Zell. I am very much obliged to
you for the share you take in the marriage of my son, and for the wishes
you offer for the happy effects which may be expected from it. I shall
be always very well pleased to see the happiness of my family turn to
the advantage of the English nation. I entreat you to be persuaded of
the perfect esteem I have for you, and that I am very sincerely, &amp;c.”</P>

Herrenhausen, <DATE>Sept. 9, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>“THE departure of Mr. Poule, your Majesty's Envoy, seems to au∣thorize
the liberty which I take of renewing my very humble
respects to your Majesty, and of entreating you most humbly to be so
good as to consider me always as one of those who have most veneration
for your sacred person. I have strongly entreated Mr. Poule to assure
<PB N="709" REF="741"/>
your Majesty of this more fully. He always conducted himself at this
court in so very proper a manner, that he has made himself very much
beloved and esteemed. I think myself obliged to give him this testimo∣ny,
and at the same time to entreat your Majesty, most humbly, to be so
good as to do me the favour of considering me always as, Madam, &amp;c.”</P>

<P>“I Have just received by Mr. How, your Majesty's Envoy Extraor∣dinary,
the gracious letter with which you was pleased to honour
me, and in which you condescended to give me so many marks of your
kindness, by taking a part in whatever happens to my family, that I
cannot express to my own satisfaction, my very humble acknowledge∣ments
of this. It is true, Madam, that your Majesty has lost a faithful
servant in the person of the deceased duke of Zell; but it is to be hoped,
that the marriage of my grandson will produce others who may venture
to pretend to the honour of your favour. As to myself, Madam, I have
entreated Mr. How to assist me in making known to your Majesty, the
sentiments of veneration which I have for you, and the respect with
which I am, Madam, &amp;c.”</P>

a very great pleasure in having your's also, and I shall never neglect
the opportunities of deserving it. You will oblige me very much by
embracing every occasion of testifying to her Majesty, that I desire no∣thing

may be agreeable to her. I am very sincerely, my Lord, &amp;c.”</P>

<P>“I Am much obliged to you for the letter you wrote to me, by
which I see that you continue to interest yourself in every thing
agreeable or disagreeable which happens to me. You gave me, on
so many occasions, proofs of your affection, and of your attachment
to the interests of my family, that I did not doubt, but you would
be greatly concerned for the loss we have sustained, by the death
of the duke of Zell, and form wishes for happy consequences from the
marriage of my son. I am the more obliged to you for these senti∣ments,
that I am thoroughly persuaded they proceed from the heart.
You may be assured, Sir, that mine for you are no less sincere, and that
I shall be very happy to find opportunities of giving you proofs of them,
by showing you how much I am, Sir, &amp;c.”</P>

your Majesty's kindness for me and for my family, the choice which
you have made of this minister, whose merit I have known so long. I
shall do myself a very great pleasure in showing him all the confidence
and distinction which he deserves. I am very grateful for the obliging
manner in which your Majesty is pleased to interest yourself in the grief
which the death of the duke of Zell justly gave me; and I am not less
so for the approbation with which you are so good as to honour the mar∣riage
