<P>HOW different, my Rivers, is your
last letter from all your Emily
has ever yet received from you!
What have I done to deserve such suspi∣cions?
How unjust are your sex in all their
connexions with ours!</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Do I not know love? and does this re∣proach
come from the man on whom my
heart doats, the man, whom to make hap∣py,
I would with. transport cease to live?
can you one moment doubt your Emily's
tenderness? have not her eyes, her air, her
look, her indiscretion, a thousand times
told you, in spite of herself, the dear se∣cret
of her heart, long before she was
conscious of the tenderness of yours?</P>
<P>Did I think only of myself, I could live
with you in a desart; all places, all situa∣tions
are equally charming to me, with
you: without you, the whole world af∣fords
nothing which could give a mo∣ment's
pleasure to your Emily.</P>
<P>Let me but see those eyes in which the
tenderest love is painted, let me but hear
that enchanting voice, I am insensible to all
else, I know nothing of what pusses around
me; all that has no relation to you passes
away like a morning dream, the impression
of which is effaced in a moment: my ten∣derness
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
for you fills my whole soul, and
leaves no room for any other idea. Rank,
fortune, my native country, my friends,
all are nothing in the balance with my
Rivers.</P>
<P>For your own sake, I once more entreat
you to return to England: I will follow
you; I will swear never to marry another;
I will see you, I will allow you to continue
the tender inclination which unites us.
Fortune may there be more favorable to
our wishes than we now hope; may join
us without destroying the peace of the best
of parents.</P>
<P>But if you persist, if you will sacrifice
every consideration to your tenderness—
My Rivers, I have no will but yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss FERMOR, at Silleri.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 17.</DATE></DATELINE>
My dear Bell,</OPENER>
<P>LUCY, being deprived of the pleasure
of writing to you, as she intended,
by Lady Anne Melville's dining with her,
desires me to make her apologies.</P>
<P>Allow me to say something for myself,
and to share my joy with one who will, I
am sure, so very sincerely sympathize with
me in it.</P>
<P>I could not have believed, my dear Bell,
it had been so very easy a thing to be
constant: I declare, but don't mention this,
lest I should be laughed at, I have never
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
felt the least inclination for any other
woman, since I married your lovely friend.</P>
<P>I now see a circle of Beauties with the
same indifference as a bed of snowdrops:
no charms affect me but hers; the whole
creation to me contains no other woman.</P>
<P>I find her every day, every hour, more
lovely; there is in my Lucy a mixture of
modesty, delicacy, vivacity, innocence, and
blushing sensibility, which add a thousand
unspeakable graces to the most beautiful
person the hand of nature ever formed.</P>
<P>There is no describing her enchanting
smile, the smile of unaffected, artless ten∣derness.
How shall I paint to you the
sweet involuntary glow of pleasure, the
kindling fire of her eyes, when, I approach;
or those thousand little dear at∣tentions
of which love alone knows the value?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
I never, my dear girl, knew happiness
till now; my tenderness is absolutely a
species of idolatry; you cannot think what
a slave this lovely girl has made me.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, the little tyrant insists
on my omitting a thousand civil things
I had to say to you, and attending her and
Lady Anne immediately to the opera; she
bids me however tell you, she loves you
<HI>passing the love of woman,</HI> at least of hand∣some
women, who are not generally cele∣brated
for their candor and good-will to
each other.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, Es{que} Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<L>INDEED?</L>
<L>“Is this that haughty, gallant, gay Lo∣thario,</L>
<L>That dear persidious—”</L>
<P>Absolutely, my dear Temple, the sex
ought never to forgive Lucy for daring
to monopolize so very charming a fel∣low.
I had some thoughts of a little
<HI>badinage</HI> with you myself, if I should re∣turn
soon to England; but I now give
up the very idea.</P>
<P>One thing I will, however, venture to
say, that love Lucy as much as you please,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
you will never love her half so well as she
deserves; which, let me tell you, is a great
deal for one woman, especially, as you well
observe, one handsome woman, to say of
another.</P>
<P>I am, however, not quite clear your
idea is just: <HI>cattism</HI> if I may be allowed
the expression, seeming more likely to be
the vice of those who are conscious of
wanting themselves the dear power of pleasing.</P>
<P>Handsome women ought to be, what I
profess myself, who am however only
pretty, too vain to be envious; and yet
we see, I am afraid, too often, some little
sparks of this mean passion between rival
Beauties.</P>
<P>Impartially speaking, I believe the best
natured women, and the most free from
envy, are those who, without being very
handsome, have that <HI>je ne sçai quoi,</HI> those
nameless graces, which please even without
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
beauty; and who therefore, finding more
attention paid to them by men than their
looking-glass tells them they have a right
to expect, are for that reason. in constant
good humour with themselves, and of
course with every body else: whereas Beau∣ties,
claiming universal empire, are at war
with all who dispute their rights; that is,
with half the sex.</P>
<P>I am very good-natured myself; but it
is, perhaps, because, though a pretty
woman, I am more agreeable than hand∣some,
and have an infinity of the <HI>je ne
sçai quoi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A propos,</HI> my dear Temple, I so
pleased with what Montesquieu says on
this subject, that I find it is not in my
nature to resist translating and inserting
it; you cannot then say I have sent you a
letter in which there is nothing worth reading.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
I beg you will read this to the. misses,
for which you cannot fail of their thanks,
and for this reason; there are perhaps a
dozen women in the world who do not
think themselves handsome, but I will
venture to say, not one who does not
think herself agreeable, and that she
has this nameless charm, this so much
talked of <HI>I know not what,</HI> which is, so
much better than beauty. But to my
Montesquieu:</P>
<P>“There is sometimes, both in persons
and things, an invisible charm, a natu∣ral
grace, which we cannot define, and
which we are therefore obliged to call
the <HI>je ne sçai quoi.</HI>”</P>
<P>“It seems to me that this is an effect
principally founded on surprize.”</P>
<P>“We are touched that a person pleases
us more than she seemed at first to have
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
a right to do; and we are agreeably
surprized that she should have known
how to conquer those defects which
our eyes shewed us, but which our
hearts no longer believe: 'tis for this
reason that women, who are not hand∣some,
have often graces or agreeable∣nesses;
and that beautiful ones very
seldom have.”</P>
<P>“For a beautiful person does generally
the very contrary of what we expected;
she appears to us by degrees less ami∣able,
and, after having surprized us
pleasingly, she surprizes us in a con∣trary
manner; but the agreeable im∣pression
is old, the disagreeable one
new: 'tis also seldom that Beauties in∣spire
violent passions, which are almost
always reserved for those who have
graces, that is to say, agreeablenesses,
which we did not expect, and which,
we had no reason to expect.”</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
“Magnificent habits have seldom grace,
which the dresses of shepherdesses often
have.”</P>
<P>“We admire the majesty of the dra∣peries
of Paul Veronese but we are
touched with the simplicity of Raphael,
and the exactness of Corregio.”</P>
<P>“Paul Veronese promises much, and
pays all he promises; Raphael and Cor∣regio
promise little, and pay much,
which pleases us more.”</P>
<P>“These graces, these agreeablenesses,
are found oftener in the mind than
in the countenance: the charms of a
beautiful countenance are seldom hidden,
they appear at first view; but the mind
does not shew itself except by degrees,
when it pleases, and as much as it pleases;
it can conceal itself in order to appear,
and give that species of surprize to
which those graces, of which I speak,
owe their existence,”</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
“This grace, this agreeableness, is less
in the countenance than in the manner;
the manner changes every instant, and
can therefore every moment give us
the pleasure of surprize: in one word,
a woman can be handsome but in one
way, but she may be agreeable in a
hundred thousand.”</P>
<P>I like this doctrine of Montesquieu's
extremely, because it gives every woman
her chance, and because it ranks me above
a thousand handsomer women, in the dear
power of inspiring passion.</P>
<P>Cruel creature! why did you give me
the idea of flowers? I now envy you your
foggy climate: the earth with you is at
this moment covered with a thousand
lovely children of the spring; with us, it
is an universal plain of snow.</P>
<P>Our beaux are terribly at a loss for
smilies: you have lillies of the valley for
comparisons; we nothing but what with
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
the idea of whiteness gives that of cold∣ness
too.</P>
<P>This is all the quarrel I have with Ca∣nada:
the summer is delicious, the win∣ter
pleasant with all its severities; but
alas! the smiling spring is not here;
we pass from winter to summer in an instant,
and lose the sprightly season of the Loves.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER my immense letter to your
love, my dear, you must not expect
me to say much to your fair ladyship.</P>
<P>I am glad to find you manage Temple
so admirably; the wisest, the wildest, the
gravest, and the gayest, are equally our
slaves, when we have proper ideas of pet∣ticoat
politics.</P>
<P>I intend to compose a code of laws for
the government of husbands, and get it
translated into all the modern languages;
which I apprehend will be of infinite be∣nefit
to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Do you know I am a greater fool than
I imagined? You may remember I was
always extremely fond of sweet waters.
I left them off lately, upon an idea,
though a mistaken one, that Fitzgerald
did not like them: I yesterday heard him
say the contrary; and, without thinking
of it, went mechanically to my dressing∣room,
and put lavender water on my
handkerchief.</P>
<P>This is, I am afraid, rather a strong
symptom of my being absurd; however,
I find it pleasant to be so, and therefore
give way to it.</P>
<P>It is divinely warm to-day, though the
snow is still on the ground; it is melting
fast however, which makes it impossible
for me to get to Quebec. I shall be
confined for at least a week, and Emily
not with me: I die for amusement. Fitz∣gerald
ventures still at the hazard of his
own neck and his horses legs; for the
latter of which animals I have so much
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
compassion, that I have ordered both to
stay at home a few days, which days I
shall devote to study and contemplation,
and little pert chit-chats with papa, who
is ten times more fretful at being kept
within doors than I am: I intend to
win a little fortune of him at piquet be∣fore
the world breaks in upon our soli∣tude.

<OPENER>To the Earl of—
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>“TIS indeed, my Lord, an advantage
for which we cannot be too thank∣ful
to the Supreme Being, to be born in
a country whose religion and laws are
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
such, as would have been the objects of
our wishes, had we been born in any
other.</P>
<P>Our religion, I would be understood to
mean Christianity in general, carries in∣ternal
conviction by the excellency of its
moral precepts, and its tendency to make
mankind happy; and the peculiar mode
of it established in England breathes be∣yond
all others the mild spirit of the
Gospel, and that charity which embraces
all mankind as brothers.</P>
<P>It is equally free from enthusiasm and
superstition; its outward form is decent
and. respectful, without affected ostenta∣tion;
and what shews its excellence
above all others is, that every other
church allows it to be the best, except
itself: and it is an established rule, that
he has an undoubted right to the first
rank of merit, to whom every man allows
the second.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
As to our government, it would be
impertinent to praise it; all mankind al∣low
it to be the master-piece of human
wisdom.</P>
<P>It has the advantage of every other
form, with as little of their inconvenien∣ces
as the imperfection attendant on all
human inventions will admit: it has the
monarchic quickness of execution and
stability, the aristocratic diffusive strength
and wisdom of counsel, the democra∣tic
freedom and equal distribution of
property.</P>
<P>When I mention equal distribution of
property, I would not be understood to
mean such an equality as never existed,
nor can exist but in idea; but that gene∣ral,
that comparative equality, which
leaves to every man the absolute and
safe possession of the fruits of his labors;
which softens offensive distinctions, and
curbs pride, by leaving every order of
men in some degree dependent on the
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
other; and admits of those gentle and
almost imperceptible gradations, which
the poet so well calls,
<Q>“The” according music of a well-mix'd
“state.”</Q></P>
<P>The prince is here a centre of union;
an advantage, the want of which makes
a democracy, which is so beautiful in
theory, the very worst of all possible go∣vernments,
except absolute monarchy, in practice.</P>
<P>I am called upon, my Lord, to go to
the citadel, to see the going away of the
ice; an object so new to me, that I can∣not
resist the curiosity I have to see it,
though my going thither is attended with
infinite difficulty.</P>
<P>Bell insists on accompanying me: I
am afraid for her, but she will not be re∣fused.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Earl of—.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 20,</DATE> Evening.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are returned, my Lord, from
having seen an object as beautiful
and magnificent in itself, as pleasing from
the idea it gives of renewing once more
our intercourse with Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Before I saw the breaking up of the
vast body of ice, which forms what is
here called <HI>the bridge,</HI> from Quebec to
Point Levi, I imagined there could be
nothing in it worth attention; that the
ice would pass away, or dissolve gradually,
day after day, as the influence of the sun,
and warmth of the air and earth increas∣ed;
and that we should see the river open,
without having observed by what degrees
it became so.</P>
<P>But I found <HI>the great river,</HI> as the sa∣vages
with much propriety call it, main∣tain
its dignity in this instance as in all
others, and assert its superiority over those
petty streams which we honor with the
names of rivers in England. Sublimity
is the characteristic of this western world;
the loftiness of the mountains, the gran∣deur
of the lakes and rivers, the majesty
of the rocks shaded with a pictureique
variety of beautiful trees and shrubs, and
crowned with the noblest of the offspring
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
of the forest, which form the banks of
the latter, are as much beyond the power
of fancy as that of description: a land∣scape-painter
might here expand his ima∣gination,
and find ideas which he will
seek in vain in our comparatively little
world.</P>
<P>The object of which I am speaking has
all the American magnificence.</P>
<P>The ice before the town, or, to speak in
the Canadian stile, <HI>the bridge,</HI> being of a
thickness not less than five feet, a league
in length, and more than a mile broad,
resists for a long time the rapid tide that
attempts to force it from the banks.</P>
<P>We are prepared by many previous cir∣cumstances
to expect something extraordi∣nary
in this event, if I may so call it:
every increase of heat in the weather for
near a month before the ice leaves the
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
banks; every warm day. gives you terror
for those you see venturing to pass it in
carrioles; yet one frosty night makes it
again so strong, that even the ladies, and
the timid amongst them, still venture
themselves over in parties of pleasure;
though greatly alarmed at their return,
if a few hours of uncommon warmth in∣tervene.</P>
<P>But, during the last fortnight; the alarm
grows indeed a very serious one: the eye
can distinguish, even at a considerable
distance, that the ice is softened and
detached from the banks; and you dread
every step being death to those who, have
still the temerity to pass it, which they
will continue always to do till one or more
pay their rashness with their lives.</P>
<P>From the time the ice is no longer ***
bridge on which you see crowds driving
with such vivacity on business or pleasure,
every one is looking eagerly for its break∣ing
away, to remove the bar to the conti∣nually
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
wished and expected event, of the
arrival of ships from that world from
whence we have seemed so long in a man∣ner
excluded.</P>
<P>The hour is come; I have been with a
crowd of both sexes, and all ranks, hail∣ing
the propitious moment: our situation,
on the top of Cape Diamond, gave us a
prospect some leagues above and below
the town; above Cape Diamond the river
was open, it was so below Point Levi,
the rapidity of the current having forced
a passage for the water under the transpa∣rent
bridge, which for more than a league continued firm.</P>
<P>We stood waiting with all the eagerness
of expectation; the tide came rushing
with an amazing impetuosity; the bridge
seemed to shake, yet resisted the force of
the waters; the tide recoiled, it made a
pause, it stood still, it returned with re∣doubled
fury, the immense mass of ice gave way.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
A vast plain appeared in motion; it ad∣vanced
with solemn and majestic pace: the
points of land on the banks of the river
for a few moments stopped its progress;
but the immense weight of so prodigious
a body, carried along by a rapid current,
bore down all opposition with a force
irresistible.</P>
<P>There is no describing how beautiful
the opening river appears, every moment
gaining on the sight, till, in a time less
than can possibly be imagined, the ice
passing Point Levi, is hid in one moment
by the projecting land, and all is once
more a clear plain before you; giving
at once the pleasing, but unconnected,
ideas of that direct intercourse with Europe
from which we have been so many months
excluded, and of the earth's again open∣ing
her fertile bosom, to feast our eyes and
imagination with her various verdant and
flowery productions.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
I am afraid I have conveyed a very in∣adequate
idea of the scene which has just
passed before me; it however struck me
so strongly, that it was impossible for me
not to attempt it.</P>
<P>If my painting has the least resemblance
to the original, your Lordship will agree
with me, that the very vicissitudes of sea∣son
here partake of the sublimity which so
strongly characterizes the country.</P>
<P>The changes of season in England, be∣ing
slow and gradual, are but faintly felt;
but being here sudden, instant, violent,
afford to the mind, with the lively pleasure
arising from meer change, the very
high additional one of its being accompa∣nied
with grandeur. I have the honor to be,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mrs. TEMPLE, Pall Mall.
<DATE>April 22.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>CERTAINLY, my dear, you are
so far right; a nun may be in many
respects a less unhappy being than some
women who continue in the world; her
situation is, I allow, paradise to that of a
married woman, of sensibility and honor,
who dislikes her husband.</P>
<P>The cruelty therefore of some parents
here, who sacrifice their children to ava∣rice,
in forcing or seducing them into
convents, would appear more striking, if
we did not see too many in England guilty
of the same inhumanity, though in a dif∣ferent
manner, by marrying them against
their inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Your letter reminds me of what a
French married lady here said to me on
this very subject: I was exclaiming vio∣lently
against convents; and particularly
urging, what I thought unanswerable, the
extreme hardship of one circumstance;
that, however unhappy the state was
found on trial, there was no retreat; that
it was <HI>for life.</HI></P>
<P>Madame De—turned quick, “And
is not marriage for life?”</P>
<P>“True, Madam; and, what is worse,
without a year of probation. I confess
the force of your argument.”</P>
<P>I have never dared since to mention
convents before Madame De—.</P>
<P>Between you and I, Lucy, it is a little
unreasonable that people will come toge∣ther
entirely upon fordid principles, and
then wonder they are not happy: in de∣licate
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
minds, love is seldom the conse∣quence
of marriage.</P>
<P>It is not absolutely certain that a mar∣riage
of which love is the foundation will
be happy; but it is infallible, I believe,
that no other can be so to souls capable
of tenderness.</P>
<P>Half the world, you will please to observe,
have no souls; at least none but
of the vegetable and animal kinds: to this
species of beings, love and sentiment are
entirely unnecessary; they were made to
travel through life in a state of mind nei∣ther
quite awake nor asleep; and it is
perfectly equal to them in what company
they take the journey.</P>
<P>You and I, my dear, are something
<HI>awakened;</HI> therefore it is necessary we
should love where we marry, and for this
reason: our souls, being of the active
kind, can never be totally at rest; there∣fore,
if we were not to love our husbands.
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
we should be in dreadful danger, of loving
somebody else.</P>
<P>For my part, whatever tall maiden
aunts and cousins may say of the inde∣cency
of a young woman's distinguishing
one man from another, and of love coming
after marriage; I think marrying, in that
expectation, on sober prudent principles,
a man one dislikes, the most deliberate
and shameful degree of vice of which the
human mind is capable.</P>
<P>I cannot help observing here, that the
great aim of modern education seems
to be, to eradicate the best impulses of
the human heart, love, friendship, com∣passion,
benevolence; to destroy the
social, and encrease the selfish principle.
Parents wisely attempt to root out those
affections which should only be directed
to proper objects, and which Heaven
gave us as the means of happiness; not
considering that the success of such an at∣tempt
is doubtful; and that, if they succeed,
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
they take from life all its sweetness,
and reduce it to a dull unactive round of
tasteless days, scarcely raised, above vege∣tation.</P>
<P>If my ideas of things are right, the hu∣man
mind is naturally virtuous; the bu∣siness
of education is therefore less to give
us good impressions, which we have from
nature, than to guard us against bad
ones, which are generally acquired.</P>

<OPENER>To the Earl of—.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE pleasure the mind finds in travel∣ling,
has undoubtedly, my Lord, its
source in that love of novelty, that delight
in acquiring new ideas, which is interwoven
in its very frame, which shews itself on
every occasion from infancy to age, which
is the first passion of the human mind,
and the last.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
There is nothing the mind of man ab∣hors
so much as a state of rest: the great
secret of happiness is to keep the soul in
continual action, without those violent
exertions, which wear out its powers,
and dull its capacity of enjoyment;
it should have exercise, not labor.</P>
<P>Vice may justly be called the fever
of the soul, inaction its lethargy; pas∣sion,
under the guidance of virtue, its
health.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to see my daughter's
coquetry giving place to a tender affection
for a very worthy man, who seems formed
to make her happy: his fortune is easy;
he is a gentleman, and a man of worth
and honor, and, what perhaps inclines me
to be more partial to him, of my own
profession.</P>
<P>I mention the last circumstance in order
to introduce a request that your Lordship
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
would have the goodness to employ, that
interest for him in the purchase of a
majority, which you have so generously
offered to me; I am determined, as there
is no prospect of real duty, to quit the
army, and retire to that quiet which is so
pleasing at my time of life: I am pri∣vately
in treaty with a gentleman for my
company, and propose returning to Eng∣land
in the first ship, to give in my resignation:
in this point, as well as that of
serving Mr. Fitzgerald, I shall without
scruple call upon your Lordship's friend∣ship.</P>
<P>I have settled every thing with Fitz∣gerald,
but without saying a word to Bell;
and he is to seduce her into matrimony as
soon as he can, without my appearing at
all interested in the affair: he is to ask my
consent in form, though we have already
settled every preliminary.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
All this, as well as my intention of
quitting the army, is yet a secret to my
daughter.</P>
<P>But to the questions your Lordship does
me the honor to ask me in regard to the
Americans, I mean those of our old colo∣nies:
they appear to me, from all I have
heard and seen of them, a rough, ignorant,
positive, very selfish, yet hospitable
people.</P>
<P>Strongly attached to their own opinions,
but still more so to their interests, in
regard to which they have inconceiv∣able
sagacity and address; but in all
other respects I think naturally inferior
to the Europeans; as education does so
much, it is however difficult to ascertain this.</P>
<P>I am rather of opinion they would not
have refused submission to the stamp act,
or disputed the power of the legislature at
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
home, had not their minds been first em∣bittered
by what touched their interests
so nearly, the restraints laid on their trade
with the French and Spanish settlements,
a trade by which England was an im∣mense
gainer; and by which only a few
enormously rich West India planters were
hurt.</P>
<P>Every advantage you give the North
Americans in trade centers at last in the
mother country; they are the bees, who
roam abroad for that honey which enriches
the paternal hive.</P>
<P>Taxing them immediately after their
trade is restrained, seems like drying up
the source, and expecting the stream
to flow.</P>
<P>Yet too much care cannot be taken
to support the majesty of government,
and assert the dominion of the parent
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
A good mother will consult the interest
and happiness of her children, but will ne∣ver
suffer her authority to be disputed.</P>
<P>An equal mixture of mildness and spirit
cannot fail of bringing these mistaken peo∣ple,
misled by a few of violent temper and
ambitious views, into a just sense of their
duty.</P>

<P>I HAVE got my Emily again, to my

As the roads are already very good,
we walk and ride perpetually, and amuse our∣selves
as well as we can, <HI>en attendant</HI> your

<P>The quickness of vegetation in this

<OPENER>To the Earl of—.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>May 5.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been conversing, if the expres∣sion
is not improper when I have not
had an opportunity of speaking a syllable,
more than two hours with a French officer,
who has declaimed the whole time with the
most astonishing volubility, without utter∣ing
one word which could either entertain
or instruct his hearers; and even without
starting any thing that deserved the name
of a thought.</P>
<P>People who have no ideas out of the
common road are, I believe, generally the
greatest talkers, because all their thoughts
are low enough for common conversation;
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
whereas those of more elevated under∣sandings
have ideas which they cannot
easily communicate except to persons of
equal capacity with themselves.</P>
<P>This might be brought as an argument
of the inferiority of womens understanding
to ours, as they are generally greater talk∣ers,
if we did not consider the limited
and trifling educations we give them;
men, amongst other advantages, have that
of acquiring a greater variety as well as
sublimity of ideas.</P>
<P>Women who have conversed much with
men are undoubtedly in. general the most
pleasing. companions; but this only shews
of what they are capable when properly
educated, since they improve so greatly by
that accidental and limited opportunity of
acquiring knowledge.</P>
<P>Indeed the two sexes are equal gainers,
by conversing with each other: there is a
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
mutual desire of pleasing, in a mixed con∣versation,
restrained by politeness, which
sets every amiable quality in a stronger
light.</P>
<P>Bred in ignorance from one age to
another, women can learn little of their
own sex.</P>
<P>I have often thought this the reason
why officers daughters are in general more
agreeable than other women in an equal
rank of life.</P>
<P>I am almost tempted to bring Bell as
an instance; but I know the blindness
and partiality of nature, and therefore
check what paternal tenderness would
dictate.</P>
<P>I am shocked at what your Lordship
tells me of Miss H—. I know her
imprudent, I believe her virtuous: a great
flow of spirits has been ever hurrying her
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
into indiscretions; but allow me to say,
my Lord, it is particularly hard to fix the
character by our conduct, at a time of life
when we are not competent judges of
our own actions; and when the hurry and
vivacity of youth carries us to commit a
thousand follies and indiscretions, for
which we blush when the empire of reason
begins.</P>
<P>Inexperience and openness of temper
betray us in early life into improper con∣nexions
and the very constancy, and no∣bleness
of nature, which characterize the
best hearts, continue the delusion.</P>
<P>I know Miss H—perfectly; and am
convinced, if her father will treat her as a
friend, and with the indulgent tenderness
of affection endeavor to wean her from a
choice so very unworthy of her, he will
infallibly succeed; but if he treats her
with harshness, she is lost for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49"/>
He is too stern in his behaviour, too
rigid in his morals: it is the interest
of virtue to be represented as she is,
lovely, smiling, and ever walking hand
in hand with pleasure: we were formed
to be happy, and to contribute
to the happiness of our fellow-creatures;
there are no real virtues but the social
ones.</P>
<P>'Tis the enemy of human kind who has
thrown around us the gloom of supersti∣tion,
and taught that ausierity and volun∣tary
misery is virtue.</P>
<P>If moralists would indeed improve hu∣man
nature, they should endeavor to ex∣pand,
not to contract the heart; they
should build their system on the passions
and affections, the only foundations of
the nobler virtues.</P>
<P>From the partial representations of nar∣row-minded
bigots, who paint the Deity
from their own gloomy conceptions, the
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
young are too often frighted from the
paths of virtue; despairing of ideal per∣factions,
they give up all virtue as unat∣tainable,
and start aside from the road
which they falsely suppose strewed with
thorns.</P>
<P>I have studied the heart with some at∣tention;
and am convinced every parent,
who will take the pains to gain his chil∣drens
friendship, will for ever be the
guide and arbiter of their conduct: I
speak from a happy experience.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all my daughter says
in gaiety of heart, she would sooner even
relinquish the man she loves, than offend
a father in whom she has always found
the tenderest and most faithful of friends.
I am interrupted, and have only time to

<HEAD>LETTER CXXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Montreal.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>May 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM returned, my Rivers, to my
sweet friend, and have again the dear
delight of talking of you without re∣straint;
she bears with, she indulges me
in, all my weakness if that name ought
to be given to a tenderness of which the
object is the most exalted and worthy
of his sex.</P>
<P>It was impossible I should not have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oved you; the soul that spoke in those
eloquent eyes told me, the first moment
we met, our hearts were formed for each
other; I saw in that amiable counte∣nance
a sensibility similar to my own,
but which I had till then fought in vain;
I saw there those benevolent smiles, which
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
are the marks, and the emanations of
virtue; those thousand graces which
ever accompany a mind conscious of its
own dignity, and satisfied with itself;
in short, that mental beauty which is
the express image of the Deity.</P>
<P>What defence had I against you, my
Rivers, since your merit was such that
my reason approved the weaknes of my
heart?</P>
<P>We have lost Madame Des Roches; we
were both in tears at parting; we em∣braced,
I pressed her to my bosom: I
love her, my dear Rivers; I have an af∣fection
for her which I scarce know how
to describe. I saw her every day, I
found infinite pleasure in being with
her; she talked of you, she praised you,
and my heart was soothed; I however
found it impossible to mention your
name to her; a reserve for which I
cannot account; I found pleasure in
looking at her from the idea that she
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
was dear to you, that she felt for you
the tenderest friendship: do you know I
think she has some resemblance of you?
there is something in her smile, which
gives me an idea of you.</P>
<P>Shall I, however, own all my folly? I
never found this pleasure in seeing her
when you were present: on the contrary,
your attention to her gave me pain: I
was jealous of every look; I even saw her
amiable qualities with a degree of envy,
which checked the pleasure I should other∣wise
have found in her conversation.</P>
<P>There is always, I fear, some injustice
mixed with love, at least with love so
ardent and tender as mine.</P>
<P>You, my Rivers, will however pardon
that injustice which is a proof of my ex∣cess
of tenderness.</P>
<P>Madame Des Roches has promised to
write to me: indeed I will love her; I will
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
conquer this little remain of jealousy, and
do justice to the most gentle and amiable
of women.</P>
<P>Why should I dislike her for seeing you
with my eyes, for having a soul whose
feelings resemble my own?</P>
<P>I have observed her voice is softened,
and trembles, like mine, when she names
you.</P>
<P>My Rivers, you were formed to charm
the heart of woman; there is more plea∣sure
in loving you, even without the hope
of a return, than in the adoration of all
your sex: I pity every woman who is so
insensible as to see you without tenderness.
This is the only fault I ever found in Bell
Fermor: she has the most lively friend∣ship
for you, but she has seen you with∣out
love. Of what materials must her
heart be composed?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57"/>
No other man can inspire the same sen∣timents
with my Rivers; no other man
can desrve them: the delight of loving
you appears to me so superior to all other
pleasures, that, of all human beings, if
I was not Emily Montague, I would be
Madame Des Roches.</P>
<P>I blush for what I have written; yet
why blush for having a soul to distinguish
perfection, or why conceal the real feel∣ings
of my heart?</P>
<P>I will never hide a thought from you;
you shall be at once the confidant and the
dear object of my tenderness.</P>
<P>In what words—my Rivers, you rule
every emotion of my heart; dispose as you
please of your Emily: yet, if you allow
her to form a wish in opposition to yours,
indulge her in the transport of returning
you to your friends: let her receive you
from the hands of a mother, whose happi∣ness
you ought to prefer even to hers.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58"/>
Why will you talk of the mediocrity of
your fortune? have you not enough for
every real want? much less, with you,
would make your Emily blest: what have
the trappings of life to do with happi∣ness?
'tis only sacrificing pride to love
and silial tenderness; the worst of human
passions to the best.</P>
<P>I have a thousand things to say, but am
forced to steal this moment to write to
you: we have some French ladies here,

<P>IT were indeed, my Lord, to be wished
that we had here schools, at the ex∣pence
of the public, to teach English to
the rising generation: nothing is a stronger
tie of brotherhood and affection, a greater
cement of union, than speaking one com∣mon
language.</P>
<P>The want of attention to this circum∣stance
has, I am told, had the worst effects
possible in the province of New York,
where the people, especially at a distance
from the capital, continuing to speak
Dutch, retain their affection for their
ancient matters, and still look on their
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
English fellow subjects as strangers and
intruders.</P>
<P>The Canadians are the more easily to
be won to this, or whatever else their
own, or the general good requires, as
their noblesse have the strongest attac∣hment
to a court, and that favor is the
great object of their ambition: were
English made by degrees the court
language, it would soon be universally
spoke.</P>
<P>Of the three great springs of the human
heart, interest, pleasure, vanity, the last
appears to me much the strongest in the
Canadians; and I am convinced the most
forcible tie their noblesse have to France,
is their unwillingness to part with their
croix de St. Louis: might not therefore
some order of the same kind be instituted
for Canada, and given to all who have
the croix, on their sending back the ensigns
they now wear, which are inconsistent
with their allegiance as British subjects?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61"/>
Might not such an order be contriv∣ed,
to be given at the discretion of the
governor, as well to the Canadian gen∣tlemen
who merited most of the go∣vernment,
as to the Englivh officers of
a certain rank, and such other English
as purchased estates, and settled in the
country? and, to give it additional
lustre, the governor, for the time being,
be always head of the order?</P>
<P>'Tis possible something of the same
kind all over America might be also of
service; the passions of mankind arc
nearly the same every where: at least I
never yet saw the soil or climate, where
vanity did not grow; and till all man∣kind
become philosophers, it in by their
passions they must be governed.</P>
<P>The common people, by whom I
mean the penfantry, have been great
gainers here by the change of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;
their property is more secure, their
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
independence greater, their profits much
more than doubled: it is not them there∣fore
whom it is necessary to gain.</P>
<P>The noblesse, on the contrary, have
been in a great degree undone: they have
lost their employs, their rank, their
consideration, and many of them their
fortunes.</P>
<P>It is therefore equally consnant to
good policy and to humanity that they
should be considered, and in the way
most acceptable to them the rich con∣ciliated
by little honorary distinctions,
those who are otherwise by sharing in
all lucrative employs; and all of them
by bearing a part in the legislature of
their country.</P>
<P>The great objects here seem to be to
heal those wounds, which part unhappy
disputes have left still in some degree
open; to unite the French and English,
the civil and military, in one firm body;
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
to raise a revenue, to encourage agricul∣ture,
and especially the growth of hemp
and flax; and find a staple, for the im∣provement
of a commerce, which at pre∣sent
labors under a thousand disadvan∣tages.</P>
<P>But I shall say little on this or any po∣litical
subject relating to Canada, for a
reason which, whilst I am in this colony,
it would look like flattery to give: let it
suffice to say; that, humanly speaking, it
is impossible that the inhabitants of this

<P>You can have no idea of the universal

inspired.</P>

If our joy is so great, who preserve a

<OPENER>To Miss FERMOR, at Silleri.
Pall Mall, <DATE>April 2.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WHILST I was sealing my letter,
I received yours of the Ist of Fe∣bruary.</P>
<P>I am excesively alarmed, my dear,
at the account it gives me of Miss Mon∣tague's
having broke with her lover, and
of my brother's extreme affection for
her.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
I did not dare to let my mother see
that letter, as I am convinced the very
idea of a marriage which must for ever
separate her from a son she loves to ido∣latry,
would be fatal to her; she is al∣tered
since his leaving England more
than you can imagine; she is grown
pale and thin, her vivacity has entirely
left her. Even my marriage scarce seem∣ed
to give her pleasure; yet such is her
delicacy, her ardor for his happiness, she
will not suffer me to say this to him, lest
it should constrain him, and prevent his
making himself happy in his own way.
I often find her in tears in her apart∣ment;
she affects a smile when she sees
me, but it is a smile which cannot de∣ceive
one who knows her whole soul as
I do. In short, I am convinced she will
not live long unless my brother returns.
She never names him without being
softened to a degree not to be ex∣pressed.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Amiable and lovely as you represent
this charming woman, and great as the
sacrifice is she has made to my brother, it
seems almost cruelty to wish to break his
attachment to her; yet, situated as they
are, what can be the consequence of their
indulging their tenderness at present, but
ruin to both?</P>
<P>At all events, however, my dear, I in∣treat,
I conjure you, to press my brother's
immediate return to England; I am con∣vinced,
my mother's life depends on seeing
him.</P>
<P>I have often been tempted to write to
Miss Montague, to use her influence with
him even against herself.</P>
<P>If she loves him, she will have his true
happiness at heart; she will consider what
a mind like his must hereafter suffer,
should his fondness for her be fatal to the
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
best of mothers she will urge, she will
oblige him to return, and make this step
the condition of preserving her tender∣ness.</P>
<P>Read this letter to her and tell her,
it is to her affection for my brother, to
her generosity, I trust for the life of a
parent who is dearer to me than my
existence.</P>
<P>Tell her my heart is hers, that I will
receive her as my guardian angel, that
we will never part, that we will be
friends, that we will be sisters, that I
will omit nothing possible to make her
happy with my brother in England, and
that I have very rational hopes it may
be in time accomplished; but that, if
she marries him in Canada, and suffers
him to pursue his present design, she
plants a dagger in the bosom of her
who gave him life.</P>

I scarce know what I would say, my
dear Bell; but I am wretched; I have
no hope but in you. Yet if Emily is all

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>May 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 8th of April, my
dear, was first read by Emily, being
one of the three I gave her for that pur∣pose,
as I before mentioned.</P>
<P>She went through it, and melting
into tears, left the room without speaking
a word: she has been writing this
morning, and I fancy to you, for she en∣quired
when the mail set out for Eng∣land,
and seemed pleased to hear it went
to-day.</P>
<P>I am excessively shocked at your account
of Mrs. Rivers: assure her, in my name, of
your brother's immediate return; I know
both him and Emily too well to believe
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
they will sacrifice her to their own hap∣piness:
there is nothing, on the contrary,
they will not suffer rather than even affect her.</P>
<P>Do not, however, encourage an idea
of ever breaking an attachment like theirs;
an attachment founded less in pasion than
in the tenderest friendship, in a similarity
of character, and a sympathy the most
perfect the world ever saw.</P>
<P>Let it be your business, my Lucy, to
endeavor to make them happy, and to re∣move
the bars which prevent their union
in England; and depend on seeing them
there the very moment their coming is
possible.</P>
<P>From what I know of your brother, I
suppose he will insist on marrying Emily
before he leaves Quebec; but, after your
letter, which I shall send him, you may
look on his return as infallible.</P>

<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Quebec.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>April 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY own happiness, my dear Rivers;
In a marriage of love, makes me
extremely unwilling to prevent your giv∣ing
way to a tenderness, which promises
you the same felicity, with so amiable a
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
woman as both you and Bell Fermor re∣present
Miss Montague to; be.</P>
<P>But, my dear Ned, I cannont, without
betraying your friendship, and hazarding
all the quiet of your future days, dispense
with myself from telling you, though I
have her express commands to the con∣trary,
that the peace, perhaps the life,
of your excellent mother, depends on
your giving up all thoughts of a settle∣ment
in America, and returning immediately to England.</P>
<P>I know the present state of your affairs
will not allow you to marry this charming
woman here, withoutg descending from the
situation you have ever held, and which
you have a right from your birth to hold,
in the world.</P>
<P>Would you allow me to gratisfy my
friendship for you, and show, at the same
time, your perfect esteem for me, by com∣manding,
what our long affection gives
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
you a right to, such a part of my fortune
as I could easily spare without the least
inconvenience to myself, we might all be
happy and you might make your Emily
so: but you have already convinced me
by your resusal of a former request of this
kind, that your esteem for me is much
less warm than mine for you; and that
you do not think I merit the delight of
making you happy.</P>
<P>I will therefore say no more on this
subject till we meet, than that I have
no doubt this letter will bring you imme∣diately
to us.</P>
<P>If the tenderness you express for Miss
Montague is yet conquerable, it will
surely be better for both it should be
conquered, as fortune has been so much
less kind to each of you than nature; but if
your hearts are immoveably fixed on each
other, if your love is of the kind which
despises every other consideration, return
to the bosom of friendship, and depend
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
on our finding some way to make you
happy.</P>
<P>If you persist in refusing to share my
fortune, you can have no objection to my
using all my interest, for a friend and bro∣ther
so deservedly dear to me, and in whose
happiness I shall ever find my own.</P>
<P>Allow me now to speak of myself; I
mean of my dearer self, your amiable
sister, for whom my tenderness, instead of
decreasing, grows every moment stronger.</P>
<P>Yes, my friend, my sweet Lucy is every
hour more an angel: her desire of being
beloved, renders her a thousand times
more lovely; a countenance animated by
true tenderness will always charm beyond
all the dead uninformed features the
hand of nature ever framed; love embel∣lishes
the whole form, gives spirit and
softness to the eyes, the most vivid bloom
to the complexion, dignity to the air,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
grace to every motion, and throws round
beauty almost the rays of divinity.</P>
<P>In one word, my Lucy was always
more lovely than any other woman; she
is now more lovely than even her former
self.</P>
<P>You, my Rivers, will forgive the over∣flowings
of my fondness, because you
know the merit of its object.</P>

<P>YOUR letter, Madam, to Miss Fer∣mor,
which, by an accident, was
first read by me, has removed the veil
which love had placed before mine eyes,
and shewed me, in one moment, the folly
of all those dear hopes I had indulged.</P>
<P>You do me but justice in believing me
incapable of suffering your brother to sa∣crifice
the peace, much less the life, of an
amiable mother, to my happiness: I have
no doubt of his returning to England the
moment he receives your letters; but,
knowing his tenderness, I will not expose
him to struggle on this occasion: I will

myself, unknown to him, as he is fortu∣nately
absent, embark in a ship which has
wintered, here, and will leave Quebec in
ten days.</P>

a moment's reflection will convince you
of the extreme impropriety of my accept∣ing
it.</P>
<P>Assure Mrs. Rivers, that her son will

<P>IT is with a pleasure no words can ex∣press
I tell my sweet Emily, I have
fixed on a situation which promises every
advantage we can wish as to profit, and
which has every beauty that nature can
give.</P>
<P>The land is rich, and the wood will
more than pay the expence of clearing
it; there is settlement within a few
leagues, on which there is an extreme
agreeable family: a number of Acadians
have applied to me to be received as
settlers: in short, my dear angel, all seems
to smile on our design.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
I have spent some days at the house
of a German officer, lately in our ser∣vice,
who is engaged in the fame de∣sign,
but a little advanced in it. I
have seen him increasing every hour
his little domain, by clearing the lands;
he has built a pretty house in a beau∣tifull
rustic style: I have seen his
pleasing labors with inconceivable de∣light.
I already fancy my own settle∣ment
advancing in beauty: I paint to
myself my Emily adorning those love∣ly
shades; I see her, like the mother
of mankind, admiring a new creation
which smiles around her: we appear,
to my idea, like the first pair in pa∣radise.</P>
<P>I hope to be with you the Ist of June:
will you allow me to set down the 2d as
the day which is to assure to me a life of
happiness?</P>

<P>EMILY has wrote to you, and ap∣pears
more composed; she does not
however tell me what she has resolved
she has only mentioned a design of
spending a week at Quebec. I sup∣pose
she will take no resolution till
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
your brother comes down: he cannot
be here in less than ten days.</P>
<P>She has heard from him, and he has
fixed on a settlement depend how∣ever
on his return to England, even if
It is not to stay. I wish he could pre∣vail
on Mrs. Rivers to accompany
him back. The advantages of his de∣sign
are too great to lose: the voyage
is nothing; the climate healthy beyond
all conception.</P>
<P>I fancy he will marry as soon as he
comes down from Montreal, set off in
the first ship for England, leave Emily
with me, and return to us next year:
at least, this is the plan my heart has
formed.</P>
<P>I wish Mrs. Rivers had borne his
absence better; her impatience to see
him has broken in on all our schemes;
Emily and I had in fancy formed a
little Eden on Lake Champlain: Fitz∣gerald
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
had promised me to apply for
lands near them; we should have been
so happy in our little new world of
friendship.</P>
<P>There is nothing certain in this vile
state of existence: I could philosophize
extremely well this morning.</P>
<P>All our little plans of amusement
too for this summer are now at an
end; your brother was the soul of all
our parties. This is a trifle, but my
mind to-day seeks for every subject of
chagrin.</P>
<P>Let but my Emily be happy, and I will
not complain, even if I lose her: I have a
thousand fears, a thousand uneasy reflec∣tions:
if you knew her merit, you would
not wish to break the attachment.</P>
<P>My sweet Emily is going this morning
to Quebec; I have promised to accom∣pany
her, and she now waits for me.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>
I cannot write: I have a heaviness
about my heart, which has never left me
since I read your letter. 'Tis the only
disagreeable one I ever received from

you so well as before I saw this letter.

<P>I AM unhappy beyond all words; my
sweet Emily is gone to England; the
ship failed this morning: I am just re∣turned
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
from the beach, after conducting
her on board.</P>
<P>I used every art, every persuasion, in
the power, of friendship, to prevent her
going till your brother came down; but
all I said was in vain. She told me,
“she knew too well her own weakness.
to hazard seeing him; that she also knew
his tenderness, and was resolved to spare
him the struggle between his affec∣tion
and his duty; that she was de∣termined
never to marry him but with
the consent of his mother; that their
meeting at Quebec, situated as they
were, could only be the source of
unhappiness to both; that her heart
doated on him, but that she would
never be the cause of his acting in a
manner unworthy his character: that
she would see his family the moment
she got to London, and then retire
to the house of a relation in Berk∣shire,
where she would wait for his ar∣rival.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
That she had given you her pro∣mise,
which nothing should make her
break, to embark in the first ship for
England.”</P>
<P>She expressed no fears for herself as to
the voyage, but trembled at the idea of
her Rivers's danger.</P>
<P>She sat down several times yesterday
to write to him, but her tears pre∣vented
her: she at last assumed courage
enough to tell him her design; but it
was in such terms as convinced me she
could not have pursued it, had he been
here.</P>
<P>She went to the ship with an appear∣ance
of calmness that astonished me; but
the moment she entered, all her resolution
forsook her: she retired with me to her
room, where she gave way to all the
agony of her soul</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91"/>
The word was given to sail; I was
summoned away; she rose hastily, she
pressed me to her bosom, “Tell him,”
said she, “his Emily”—she could say
no more.</P>
<P>Never in my life did I feel any sorrow
equal to this separation. Love her, my
Lucy; you can never have half the ten∣derness

<P>IT was my wish, my hope, my no∣blest

of seeing this wish accomplished in Ca∣nada,
though fortune denied it me in
England.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93"/>
The letter which I inclose has put
an end to those fond delusive hopes:
I must return immediately to England;
did not my own heart dictate this step,
I know too well the goodness of yours,
to expect the continuance of your esteem,
were I capable of purchasing happiness,
even the happiness of calling you mine, at
the expence of my mother's life, or even,
of her quiet.</P>
<P>I must now submit to see my Emily
in an humbler situation to see her want
those pleasures, those advantages, those
honors, which fortune gives, and which she
has so nobly sacrificed to true delicacy of
mind, and, if I do not flatter myself, to
her generous and disinterested affection for
me.</P>
<P>Be assured, my dearest: angel, the in∣conveniencies
attendant on a narrow for∣tune,
the only one I have to offer, shall

attention, that unwearied solicitude to
please, of which the heart alone knows
the value.</P>
<P>Fortune has no power over minds
like ours; we possess treasure to which
all she has to give is nothing, the dear
exquisite delight of loving, and of being
beloved.</P>
<P>Awake to all the finer feelings of ten∣er
esteem and elegant desire we have
very real good in each other.</P>

affluence, my dear Temple, and am too

avoid rating them above their worth.</P>
<P>Riches undoubtedly purchase a variety

<P>He has sent his servant to Quebec, with
orders to take passage for him in the first

<P>He came down in the hope of marrying

<P>YOUR brother has taken his passage
in a very fine ship, which will sail the

Rivers persuades Fitzgerald to apply
for the lands which he had fixed upon on
Lake Champlain, as he has no thoughts
of ever returning hither.</P>
<P>I will prevent this, however, if I have
any influence: I cannot think with pa∣tience
of continuing in America, when
my two amiable friends have left
it; I had no motive for wishing a settle∣ment
here, but to form a little society of
friends, of which they made the principal
Part.</P>
<P>Besides, the spirit of emulation would
have kept up my courage, and given fire
and brilliancy to my fancy.</P>
<P>Emily and I should have been trying
who had the most lively genius at crea∣tion;
who could have produced the
fairest flowers; who have formed the
woods and rocks into the most beautiful
arbors, vistoes, grottoes; have taught
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
the streams to flow in the most pleasing
meanders; have brought into view the
greatest number and variety of those lovely
little falls of water with which this fairy
land abounds; and shewed nature in the
fairest: form.</P>
<P>In short, we should have been conti∣nually
endeavoring, following the luxu∣riancy
of female imagination, to render
more charming the sweet abodes of love
and friendship; whilst our heroes, chang∣ing
their swords into plough-shares, and
engaged in more substantial, more pro∣fitable
labors, were clearing land, raising
cattle and corn, and doing every thing
becoming good farmers; or, to express it
more poetically,
<Q><L>“Taming the genius of the stubborn

By which I would be understood to
mean the Havannah, where, vanity apart,
I am told both of them did their duty, and
a little more, if a man can in such a case
be said to do more.</P>
<P>In one word, they would have been stu∣dying
the useful, to support us; we the

which I take to be assigning to the two
sexes the employments for which nature
intended them, notwithstanding the vile

<P>There are now no farmeresses in Cana∣da

the whole pleasure of the thing would be at

<P>IT is very true, my Lord, that the
Jesuit missionaries still continue in the
Indian villages in Canada; and I am a∣fraid
it is no less true, that they use every
art to instill into those people an aver∣sion
to the English; at least I have
been told this by the Indians themselves,
who seem equally surprised and piqued
that we do not send missionaries amongst
them.</P>
<P>Their ideas of Christianity are ex∣tremely
circumscribed, and they give no
preference to one mode of our faith above
another; they regard a missionary of any
nation as a kind father, who comes to
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
instruct them in the best way of wor∣shipping
the Deity, whom they suppose
more propitious to the Europeans than
to themselves; and as an ambassador
from the prince whose subject he is: they
therefore think it a mark of honor, and
a proof of esteem, to receive missionaries;
and to our remissness, and the French
wife attention on this head, is owing the
extreme attachment the greater part of
the savage nations have ever had to the
latter.</P>
<P>The French missionaries, by studying
their language, their manners, their
tempers, their dispositions; by con∣forming
to their way of life, and
using every art to gain their esteem,
have acquired an influence over them
which is scarce to be conceived; nor
would it be difficult for ours to do the
same, were they judiciously chose, and
properly encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108"/>
I believe I have said, that there is a
striking resemblance between the man∣ners
of the Canadians and the sayages;
I should have explained it, by adding,
that this resemblance has been brought
about, not by the French having won
the savages to receive European manners,
but by the very contrary; the peasants
having acquired the savage indolence in
peace, their activity and ferocity in war;
their fondness for field sports, their ha∣tred
of labor; their love of a wandering
life, and of liberty; in the latter of which
they have been in some degree indulged,
the laws here being much milder, and
more favorable to the people, than in
France.</P>
<P>Many of the officers also, and those of
rank in the colony troops, have been
adopted into the savage tribes; and
there is stronger evidence than, for the
honor of humanity, I would wish. there
was, that some of them have led the death
dance at the execution of English cap∣tives,
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
have even partook the horrid re∣past,
and imitated them in all their cru∣elties;
cruelties, which, to the eternal dis∣grace,
not only of our holy religion, but
even of our nature, these poor people,
whose ignorance is their excuse, have
been instigated to, both by the French
and English colonies, who, with a fury
truly diabolical, have offered rewards to
those who brought in the scalps of their
enemies. Rousseau has taken great pains
to prove that the most uncultivated na∣tions
are the most virtuous: I have all
due respect for this philosopher, of whose
writings I am an enthusiastic admirer;
but I have a still greater respect for truth,
which I believe is not in this instance on
his side.</P>
<P>There is little reason to boast of the vir∣tues
of a people, who are such brutal
slaves to their appetites as to be unable
to avoid drinking brandy to an excess
scarce to be conceived, whenever it falls
in their way, though eternally lamenting
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
the murders and other atrocious crimes
of which they are so perpetually guilty
when under its influence.</P>
<P>It is unjust to say we have corrupt∣ed
them, that we have taught them a
vice to which we are ourselves not ad∣dicted;
both French and English are in
general sober: we have indeed given
them the means of intoxication, which
they had not before their intercourse with
us; but he must be indeed fond of prais∣ing
them, who makes a virtue of their
having been sober, when water was the only
liquor with which they were acquainted.</P>
<P>From all that I have observed, and heard
of these people, it appears to me an un∣doubted
fact, that the most civilized In∣dian
nations are the most virtuous; a fact
which makes directly against Rousseau's
ideal system.</P>
<P>Indeed all systems make against, instead
of leading to, the discovery of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111"/>
Père Lafitau has, for this reason, in his
very learned comparison of the manners
of the savages with those of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ages,
given a very imperfect account of In∣dian
manners; he is even so candid as to
own, he tells you nothing but what makes
for the system he is endeavoring to esta∣blish.</P>
<P>My wish, on the contrary, is not to
make truth subservient to any favorite
sentiment or idea, any child of my fancy;
but to discover it, whether agreeable or
not to my own opinion.</P>
<P>My accounts may therefore be false or
imperfect from mistake or misinforma∣tion,
but will never be designedly warped
from truth.</P>
<P>That the savages have virtues, candor
must own; but only a love of paradox
can make any man assert they have more
than polished nations.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>
Your Lordship asks me what is the
general moral character of the Canadi∣ans;
they are simple and hospitable, yet
extremely attentive to interest, where it
does not interfere with that laziness which
is their governing passion.</P>
<P>They are rather devout than virtuous;
have religion without morality, and a sense
of honor without very strict honesty.</P>
<P>Indeed I belive wherever superstition
regins, the moral sense is greatly weaken∣ed;
the strongest inducement to the prac∣tice
of morality is removed, when people are
brought to belive that a few outward
ceremonies will compensate for the want
of virtue.</P>
<P>I myself heard a man, who had raised a
large fortune by very indirect means, con∣fess
his life had been contrary to every
precept of the Gospel; but that he hoped
the pardon of Heaven for all his sins, as
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
he intended to devote one of his daughters
to a conventual life as an expiation.</P>
<P>This way of being virtuous by proxy,
is certainly very easy and convenient to
such sinners as have children to sacrifice.</P>
<P>By Colonel Rivers, who leaves us in a
few days, I intend myself the honor of
addressing your Lordship again.</P>

<P>YOUR Lordship will receive this
from the hands of one of the most
worthy and amiable men I ever knew,
Colonel Rivers, whom I am particu∣larly
happy in having the honor to in∣troduce
to your Lordship, as I know
your delicacy in the choice of friends,
and that there are so few who have your
perfect esteem and confidence, that the
acquaintance of one who merits both,
at his time of life, will be regard∣ed,
even by your Lordship, as an ac∣quisition.</P>
<P>“Tis to him I shall say the advan∣tage
I procure him, by making him
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
known to a nobleman, who, with the
wisdom and experience of age, has all
the warmth of heart, the generosity,
the noble confidence, the enthusiasm, the
fire, and vivacity of youth.</P>
<P>Your Lordship's idea, in regard to
Protestant convents here, on the foot∣ing
of that we visited together at Ham∣burgh,
is extremely well worth the con∣sideration
of those whom it may con∣cern;
especially if the Romish ones
are abolished, as will most probably be
the case.</P>
<P>The noblesse have numerous families,
and, if there are no convents, will be
at a loss where to educate their daugh∣ters,
as well as where to dispose of those
who do not marry in a reasonable time:
the convenience they find in both re∣spects
from these houses, is one strong
motive to them to continue in their
ancient religion.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116"/>
As I would however prevent the more
useful, by which I mean the lower, part
of the sex from entering into this state, I
would wish. only the daughters of the
seigneurs to have the privilege of becom∣ing
nuns: they should be obliged, on tak∣ing
the vow, to prove their noblesse for
at least three generations; which would
secure them respect, and, at the same time,
prevent their becoming too numerous.</P>
<P>They should take the vow of obedience,
but not of celibacy: and reserve the
power, as at Hamburgh, of going out
to marry, though on no other considera∣tion.</P>
<P>Your Lordship may remember, every
nun at Hamburgh has a right of marrying,
except the Abbess; and that, on your
Lordship's telling the lady who then pre∣sided,
and who was young and very hand∣some,
you thought this a hardship, she an∣swered
with great spirit, “O, my Lord, you
know it is in my power to resign.”</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>
I refer your Lordship to Colonel Rivers
for that farther information in regard to
this colony, which he is much more able
to give you than I am, having visited every

<P>Your Lordship's mention of nuns has
brought to my memory a little anecdote
on this subject, which I will tell you.</P>
<P>I was, a few mornings ago, visiting a
French lady, whose very handsome daugh∣ter,
of almost sixteen, told me, she was
going into a convent. I enquired which
she had made choice of: she said, “The
General Hospital.”</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
“I am glad, Mademoiselle, you have
not chose the Ursulines; the rules are
so very severe, you would have found
them hard to conform to.”</P>
<P>“As to the rules, Sir, I have no ob∣jection
to their severity; but the habit
of the General Hospital—”</P>
<P>I smiled.</P>
<P>“Is so very light—”</P>
<P>“And so becoming, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P>She smiled in her turn, and I left her
fully convinced of the sincerity of her vo∣cation,
and the great propriety and hu∣manity
of suffering young creatures to
choose a kind of life so repugnant to hu∣man
nature, at an age when they are such
excellent judges of what will make them
happy.</P>

<P>MY poor Rivers! I think I felt more
from his going than even from
Emily's: whilst he was here, I seemed not
quite to have lost her: I now feel doubly
the loss of both.</P>
<P>He begged me to shew attention to
Madame Des Roches, who he assured me
merited my tenderest friendship; he wrote
to her, and has left the letter open in my
care: it is to thank her, in the most affec∣tionate
terms, for her politeness and
friendship, as well to himself as to his
Emily; and to offer her his best services
in England in regard to her estate, part
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
of which some people here have very un∣generously
applied for a grant of, on pre∣tence
of its not being all settled accord∣ing
to the original conditions.</P>
<P>He owned to me, he felt some re∣gret
at leaving this amiable woman in
Canada, and at the idea of never see∣ing
her more.</P>
<P>I love him for this sensibility; and for
his delicate attention to one whose disinter∣ested
affection for him most certainly de∣serves it.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald is below, he does all possi∣ble
to console me for the loss of my
friends; but indeed, Lucy, I feel their
absence most severely.</P>
<P>I have an opportunity of sending your
brother's letter to Madame Des Roches,
which I must not lose, as they are not very
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
frequent: “tis by a French gentleman who

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Twelve at night;</P>
<P>We have been talking of your brother;
I have been saying, there is nothing I so
much admire in him as that tenderness of
soul, and almost female sensibility, which
is so uncommon in a sex, whose whole
education tends to harden their hearts.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald admires his spirit, his under∣standing,
his generosity, his courage, the
warmth of his friendship.</P>
<P>My father his knowledge of the world;
not that indiscriminate suspicion of man∣kind
which is falsely so called; but that
clearness of mental sight, and discerning
faculty, which can distinguish virtue as
well as vice, wherever it resides.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>
“I also love in him,” said my father,
that noble sincerity, that integrity of
character, which is the foundation of all
the virtues.”</P>
<P>“And yet, my dear papa, you would
have had Emily prefer to him, that <HI>white
curd of asses milk,</HI> Sir George Clayton,
whose highest claim to virtue is the con∣stitutional
absence of vice, and who
never knew what it was to feel for the
sorrows of another.”</P>
<P>“You mistake, Bell: such a preference
was impossible; but she was engaged to
Sir George; and he had also a fine for∣tune.
Now, in these degenerate days,
my dear, people must eat; we have lost
all taste for the airy food of romances,
when ladies rode behind their enamored
knights, dined luxuriously on a banquet
of haws, and quenched their thirst at
the first stream.”</P>
<P>“But, my dear papa—”</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
“But, my dear Bell—”</P>
<P>I saw the.sweet old man look angry, so
chose to drop the subject; but I do aver,
now he is out of sight, that haws and a
pillion, with such a noble fellow as your
brother, are preferable to ortolans and a
coach and six, with such a piece of still
life and insipidity as Sir George.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>June 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this moment received a packet
of letters from my dear Lucy; I shall
only say; in answer to what makes the
greatest part of them, that in a fortnight
I hope you will have the pleasure of see∣ing
your brother, who did not hesitate one
moment in giving up to Mrs. Rivers's
peace of mind, all his pleasing prospects
here, and the happiness of being united to
the woman he loved.</P>
<P>You will not, I hope, my dear, forget
his having made such a sacrifice: but I
think too highly of you to say more on
this subject. You will receive Emily as
a friend, as a sister, who merits all your
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
esteem and tenderness, and who has lost all
the advantages of fortune, and incurred the
censure of the world, by her disinterested
attachment to your brother.</P>
<P>I am extremely sorry, but not surprized,
at what you tell me of poor Lady H—.
I knew her intimately; she was sacrificed at
eighteen, by the avarice and ambition of
her parents, to age, disease, ill-nature, and
a coronet; and her death is the natural
consequence of her regret: she had a soul
formed for friendship; she found it not at
home; her elegance of mind, and native
probity, prevented her seeking it abroad;
she died a melancholy victim to the tyran∣ny
of her friends, the tenderness of her
heart, and her delicate sense of honor.</P>
<P>If her father has any of the feelings of
humanity left, what must he not suffer on
this occasion?</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128"/>
It is a painful consideration, my dear,
that the happiness or misery of our lives
are generally determined before we are
proper judges of either.</P>
<P>Restrained by custom, and the ridicu∣lous
prejudices of the world, we go with
the crowd, and it is late in life before we
dare to think.</P>
<P>How happy are you and I, Lucy, in
having parents, who, far from forcing our
inclinations, have not even endeavored
to betray us into choosing from fordid
motives! They have not labored to fill
our young hearts with vanity or ava∣rice;
they have left us those virtues, those
amiable qualities, we received from na∣ture.
They have painted to us the
charms of friendship, and not taught
us to value riches above their real
Price.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"/>
My father, indeed, checks a certain
excess of romance which there is in
my temper; but, at the same time, he
never encouraged my receiving the ad∣dresses
of any man who had only the
gifts of fortune to recommend him;
he even advised me, when very young,
against marrying an officer in his regi∣ment,
of a large fortune, but an unworthy
character.</P>
<P>If I have any knowledge of the human
heart, it will be my own fault if I am not
happy with Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>I am only afraid, that when we are
married, and begin to settle into a calm,
my volatile disposition will carry me
back to coquetry: my passion for ad∣miration
is naturally strong, and has been
increased by indulgence; for without va∣nity
I have been extremely the taste of
the men.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
I have a kind, of an idea it won't be
long before I try the strength of my reso∣lution,
for I heard papa and Fitzgerald
in high consultation this morning.</P>
<P>Do you know, that, having nobody to
love but Fitzgerald, I am ten times more
enamored of the dear creature than ever?
My love is now like the rays of the sun
Collected.</P>
<P>He is so much here, I wonder I
don't grow tired of him; but somehow
he has the art of varying himself be∣yond
any man I ever knew: it was
that agreeable variety of character that
first struck me; I considered that with
him I should have all the sex in one;
he says the same of me; and in∣deed,
it must be owned we have both
an infinity of agreeable caprice, which in
love affairs is worth all the merit in the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131"/>
Have you never observed, Lucy,
that the same person is seldom great∣ly
the object of both love and friend∣ship?</P>
<P>Those virtues which command esteem
do not often inspire passion.</P>
<P>Friendship seeks the more real, more
solid virtues; integrity, constancy, and
a steady uniformity of character: love,
on the contrary, admires it knows not
what; creates itself the idol it wor∣ships;
finds charms even in defects;
is pleased with follies, with inconsis∣tency,
with caprice: to say all in one
line,
<Q>“Love is a child, and like a child he
plays.”</Q></P>
<P>The moment Emily arrives, I entreat
that one of you will write to me: no
words can speak my impatience: I am
equally anxious to hear of my dear
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>

<P>YOU are extremely mistaken, my
dear, in your idea of the society
here; I had rather live at Quebec, take
it for all in all, than in any town in Eng∣land,
except London; the mann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
living here is uncommonly agreeable;
the scenes about us are lovely, and the
mode of amusements makes us taste those
scenes in full perfection.</P>
<P>Whilst your brother and Emily were
here, I had not a wish to leave Canada;
but their going has left a void in my
heart, which will not easily be filled up:
I have loved Emily almost from child∣hood,
and there is a peculiar tenderness
in those friendships, which
<Q>“Grow with our growth, and strengthen
with our strength.”</Q>
There was also something romantic and
agreeable in finding her here, and unex∣pectedly,
after we had been separated by
Colonel Montague's having left the regi∣ment
in which my father served.</P>
<P>In short, every thing concurred to
make us dear to each other, and there∣fore
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
to give a greater poignancy to the
pain of parting a second time.</P>

angry at my very lively friendship.</P>

Des Roches; she laments the loss
of our two amiable friends; begs me to
assure them both of her eternal remem∣brance:
says, “she congratulates Emily
on possessing the heart of the man
on earth most worthy of being be∣loved;
that she cannot form an idea
of any human felicity equal to that
of the woman, the business of whose
life it is to make Colonel Rivers happy.
That, Heaven having denied her that
Happiness, she will never marry, nor
enter into an engagement, which
would make it criminal in her to re∣member
him with tenderness: that it is,
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
however, she believes, best for her he
has left the country, for that it is im∣possible
she should ever have seen him
with indifference.”</P>
<P>It is perhaps as prudent not to mention
these circumstances either to your brother
or Emily; I thought of sending her letter
to them, but there is a certain fire in her
style, mixed with tenderness, when she
speaks of Rivers, which would only have
given them both regret, by making them
see the excess of her affection for him;
her expressions are much stronger than
those in which I have given you the sense
of them.</P>
<P>I intend to be very intimate with her,
because she loves my dear Rivers; she
loves Emily too, at least she fancies she
does, but I am a little doubtful as to the
sriendships between rivals: at this distance,
however, I dare say, they will always con∣tinue
on the best terms possible, and I
would have Emily write to her.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
Do you know she has desired me to con∣trive
to get her a picture of your brother,
without his knowing it? I am not deter∣mined
whether I shall indulge her in this
fancy or not; if I do, I must employ you
as my: agent. It is madness in her to de∣sire
it; but, as there is a pleasure in being
mad, I am not sure my morality will let
me refuse her, since pleasures are not very
thick sown in this world.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>July 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BY this time, my dear Lucy, I hope
you are happy with your brother
and my sweet Emily: I am all impa∣tience
to know this from yourselves; but
it will be five or six weeks, perhaps
much more, before I can have that sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>As to me—to be plain, my dear, I
can hold no longer; I have been married
this fortnight. My father wanted to
keep it a secret, for some very foolish rea∣sons;
but it is not in my nature; I hate
secrets, they are only fit for politicians,
and people whose thoughts and actions
will not bear the light.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138"/>
For my part, I am convinced the gene∣ral
loquacity of human kind, and our
inability to keep secrets without a natural
kind of uneasiness, were meant by Provi∣dence
to guard against our laying deep
schemes of treachery against each other.</P>
<P>I remember a very sensible man, who
perfectly knew the world, used to say,
there was no such thing in nature as a
secret; a maxim as true, at least I believe
so; as it is salutary, and which I would ad∣vise
all good mammas, aunts, and gover∣nesses,
to impress strongly on the minds of
young ladies.</P>
<P>So, as I was faying, <HI>volià Madame Fitz∣gerald!</HI></P>
<P>This is, however, yet a secret here;
but, according to my present doctrine, and
following the nature of things, it cannot
long continue so.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>
You never saw so polite a husband, but
I suppose they are all so the first fortnight,
especially when married in so interesting
and romantic a manner; I am very fond of
the fancy of being thus married <HI>as it were;</HI>
but I have a notion I shall blunder it out
very soon: we were married on a party to
Three Rivers, nobody with us but papa
and Madame Villiers, who have not yet
published the mystery. I hear some misses
at Quebec are scandalous about Fitzge∣rald's
being so much here; I will leave them
in doubt a little, I think, merely to grati∣fy
their love of scandal; every body should
be amused in their way.</P>

<P>I HAVE the pleasure to tell your Lord∣ship
I have married my daughter to a
gentleman with whom I have reason to
hope she will be happy.</P>
<P>He is the second son of an Irish baronet
of good fortune, and has himself about
five hundred pounds a year, independent
of his commission; he is a man of an ex∣cellent
sense, and of honor, and has a very
lively tenderness for my daughter.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141"/>
It will, I am afraid, be some time
before I can leave this country, as I
choose to take my daughter and Mr.
Fitzgerald with me, in order to the
latter's soliciting a majority, in which
Pursuit I shall without scruple tax
your. Lordship's friendship to the ut∣most.</P>
<P>I am extremely happy at this event,
as Bell's volatile temper made me some∣times
afraid of her choosing inconsi∣derately:
their marriage is not yet
declared, for some family reasons, not
worth, particularizing to your Lord∣ship.</P>
<P>As soon as leave of absence comes
from New York, for me and Mr. Fitz∣gerald,
we shall settle things for taking
leave of Canada, which I however assure
your Lordship I shall do with some re∣luctance.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="142"/>
The climate is all the year agree∣able
and: healthy, in summer divine; a
man at my time of life cannot leave
this chearing, enlivening sun without
reluctance; the heat is very like that
of Italy or the South of France, with∣out
that oppressive closeness which ge∣nerally
attends our hot weather in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The manner of life here is chear∣ful;
we make the most of our fine
summers, by the pleasantest country par∣ties
you can imagine. Here are some
very estimable persons, and the spirit of
urbanity begins to diffuse itself from the
center: in short, I shall leave Canada at
the very time when one would wish to
come to it.</P>
<P>It is astonishing, in a small community
like this, how much depends on the per∣sonal
character of him who governs.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143"/>
I am obliged to break off abruptly, the

<P>I AGREE with you, my dear Temple,
that nothing can be more pleasing than
an <HI>awakened</HI> English woman; of which you
and my <HI>caro sposo</HI> have, I flatter myself, the
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
happy experience; and wish with you
that the character was more common:
but I must own, and I am sorry to own
it, that my fair countrywomen and fel∣low-citizens
(I speak of the nation in
general, and not of the capital) have an
unbecoming kind of reserve, Which pre∣vents
their being the agreeable compa∣nions,
and amiable wives, which nature
meant them.</P>
<P>From a fear, and I think a prudish one,
of being thought too attentive to please
your sex, they have acquired a certain
distant manner to men, which borders on
ill-breeding: they take great pains to veil,
under an affected appearance of disdain,
that winning sensibility of heart, that de∣licate
tenderness, which renders them
doubly lovely.</P>
<P>They are even afraid to own their
friendships, if not according to the square
and rule; are doubtful whether a modest
woman may own she loves even her hus∣band;
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
and seem to think affections were
given them for no purpose but to hide.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, with at least as good a
native right to charm as any women on the
face of the globe, the English have found
the happy secret of pleasing less.</P>
<P>Is my Emily arrived? I can say no∣thing
else.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I am the happiest woman in the crea∣tion:
papa has just told me, we are to

I shall see my Emily, and flirt with
Rivers; to say nothing of you and my

<DATELINE>London, <DATE>July 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I GOT to town last night, my dear, and
am at a friend's, from whence I have
this morning sent to Mrs. Rivers; I every
moment expect her answer; my anxiety
of mind is not to be expressed; my heart
sinks; I almost dread the return of my
messenger.</P>
<P>If the affections, my dear friend, give
us the highest happiness of which we are
capable, they are also the source of our
Keenest misery; what I feel at this instant,
is not to be described: I have been near
resolving to go into the country without
seeing or sending to Mrs. Rivers. If she
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
should receive me with coldness—why
should I have exposed myself to the chance
of such a reception? It would have been
better to have waited for Rivers's arrival;
I have been too precipitate; my warmth of
temper has misled me: what had I to do
to seek his family? I would give the world
to retract my message, though it was only
to let her know I was arrived; that her
son was well, and that she might every
hour expect him in England.</P>
<P>There is a rap at the door: I tremble I
know not why; the servant comes up, he
announces Mr. and Mrs. Temple: my
heart beats, they are at the door.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>They are gone, and return for me in
an hour; they insist on my dining with
them, and tell me Mrs. Rivers is impatient
to see me. Nothing was ever so polite,
so delicate, so affectionate, as the behaviour
of both; they saw my confusion, and did
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
every thing to remove it: they enquired
after Rivers, but without the least him of
the dear interest I take in him: they
spoke of the happiness of knowing me:
they asked my friendship, in a manner
the most flattering that can be imagin∣ed.
How strongly does Mrs. Temple,
my dear, resemble her amiable brother:
her eyes have the same sensibility, the
same pleasing expression; I think I
scarce ever saw so charming a woman;
I love her already; I seel a tenderness
For her, which is inconceivable; I
caught myself two or three times look∣ing
at her, with an attention for which
I blushed.</P>
<P>How dear to me is every friend of my
Rivers!</P>
<P>I believe, there was something very
foolish in my behaviour; but they had the
good-breeding and humanity not to seem
to observe it.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151"/>
I had almost forgot to tell you, they
said every thing obliging and affectionate
of you and Captain Fermor.</P>
<P>My mind is in a state not to be de∣scribed;
I feel joy, I feel anxiety, I feel
doubt, I feel a timidity I cannot conquer at
the thought of feeing Mrs. Rivers.</P>
<P>I have to dress; therefore must finish
this when I return.</P>
<P>Twelve at night.</P>
<P>I am come back, my dearest Bell; I have
gone through the scene I so much dread∣ed,
and am astonished I should ever think
of it but with pleasure. How much did
I injure this most amiable of women!
Her reception of me was that of a tender
parent, who had found a long-lost child;
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
she kissed me, she pressed me to her bo∣som;
her tears flowed in abundance; she
called me her daughter, her other Lucy:
she asked me a thousand questions of
her son; she would know all that con∣cerned
him, however minute: how he
looked, whether he talked much of her,
what were his amusements; whether
he was as handsome as when he left Eng∣land.</P>
<P>I answered her with some hesitation,
but with a pleasure that animated my
whole soul; I believe, I never appeared
to such advantage as this day.</P>
<P>You will not ascribe it to an un∣meaning
vanity, when I tell you, I never
took such pains to please I even gave a
particular attention to my dress, that I
might, as much as possible, justify my
Rivers's tenderness: I never was vain
for myself; but I am so for him: I am
indifferent to admiration as Emily Mon∣tague;
but as the object of his love, I
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
would be admired by all the world; I
wish to be the first of my sex in all that is
amiable and lovely, that I might make a
sacrifice worthy of my Rivers, in shewing
to all his friends, that he only can inspire
me with tenderness, that I live for him
alone.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rivers pressed me extremely to
pass a month with her: my heart yielded
too easily to her request; but I had cou∣rage
to resist my own wishes, as well as
her solicitations; and shall set out in
three days for Berkshire: I have, how∣ever,
promised to go with them to-mor∣row,
on a party to Richmond, which Mr.
Temple was so obliging as to propose on
my account.</P>
<P>Late as the season is, there is one more
ship going to Quebec, which fails to∣morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154"/>
You shall hear from me again in a few
days by the packet.</P>

<P>I AM arrived, my dear friend, after a
passage agreeable in itself; but which
my fears for Emily made infinitely an∣xious
and painful; every wind that
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
blew, I trembled for her; I formed to
myself ideal dangers on her account;
which reason had not power to dissipate.
We had a very tumultuous head-sea a
great part of the voyage, though the
wind was fair; a certain sign there had
been stormy weather, with a contrary
wind. I fancied my Emily exposed to
those storms; there is no expressing what
I suffered from this circumstance.</P>
<P>On entering the Channel of England,
we saw an empty boat, and some pieces of
a wreck floating; I fancied it part of the
ship which conveyed my lovely Emily; a
sudden chillness seized my whole frame,
my heart died within me at the sight: I
had scarce courage, when I landed, to en∣quire
whether she was arrived.</P>
<P>I asked the question with a trembling
voice, and had the transport to find the
ship had passed by, and to hear the per∣son
of my Emily described amongst the

herds and flocks on the side of

mother to see him, and prevent a surprize
which might have hurried her spirits too

<P>I came back, and told her I had seen a

<P>I am not painter enough to describe

difficulty we kept my mother from faint∣ing
she pressed him in her arms, she
attempted to speak, her voice faltered,
tears stole softly down her cheeks: nor
was Rivers less affected, though in a
different manner; I never saw him look
so handsome; the manly tenderness,
the filial respect, the lively joy, that were
expressed in his countenance, gave him
a look to which it is impossible to
do justice: he hinted going down to

seemed so hurt at the proposal, that

<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
him without restraint; I am every hour
more convinced of the excess of his affec∣tion:
his attention to me is inconceiv∣able;
his eyes every moment tell me, I
am dearer to him than life.</P>
<P>I am to be for some time on a visit
to his sister; he is at Mrs. Rivers's,
but, we are always together: we go
down next week to Mr. Temple's,
in Rutland; they only stayed in town,
expecting Rivers's arrival. His seat
is within six miles of Rivers's little
paternal estate, which he settled on
his mother when he left England; she
presses him to resume it, but he pe∣remptorily
refuses; he insists on her
continuing her house in town, and being
perfectly independent, and mistress of
herself.</P>
<P>I love him a thousand times more
for this tenderness to her; though, it
disappoints my dear hope of being
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
his. Did I think it possible, my dear
Bell, he could have risen higher in my
esteem?</P>
<P>If we are never united, if we always
live as at present, his tenderness will still
make the delight of my life; to see him,
to hear that voice, to be his friend, the
confidante of al1 his purposes, of all his
designs, to hear the sentiments of that
generous, that exalted soul—I would not
give up this delight, to be empress of the
world.</P>
<P>My ideas of affection are perhaps un∣common;
but they are not the less just,
nor the less in nature.</P>
<P>A blind man may as well judge of co∣lors
as the mass of mankind of the senti∣ments
of a truly-enamored heart.</P>
<P>The sensual and the cold will equally
condemn my affection as romantic; few
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
minds, my dear Bell, are capable of
love; they feel passion, they feel esteem;
they even feel that mixture of both
which is the best counterfeit of love;
but of that vivifying fire, that lively ten∣derness
which hurries us out of our∣selves,
they know nothing; that tender∣ness
which makes us forget ourselves,
when the interest, the happiness, the ho∣nor,
of him we love is concerned;
that tenderness which renders the be∣loved
object all that we see in the
creation.</P>
<P>Yes, my Rivers, I live, I breathe, I ex∣ist,
for you alone: be happy, and your
Emily is so.</P>
<P>My dear friend, you know love, and
will therefore bear with all the imperti∣nence

<OPENER>To Captain FERMOR, at Silleri.
<DATELINE>Temple-house, <DATE>Aug. 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ENJOY, my dear friend, in one
of the pleasantest houses, and most
agreeable situations imaginable, the so∣ciety
of the four persons in the world
most dear to me; I am in all respects as
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
much at home as if master of the family,
without the cares attending that station;
my wishes, my desires, are prevented
by Temple's attention and friendship,
and my mother and sister's amiable anxi∣ety
to oblige me; I find an unspeakable
softness in seeing my lovely Emily every
moment, in seeing her adored by my
family, in seeing her without restraint,
in being in the same house, in living
in that easy converse which is born
from friendship alone: yet I am not
happy.</P>
<P>It is that we lose the present happiness
in the pursuit of greater: I look forward
with impatience to that moment which
will make Emily mine; and the difficul∣ties,
which I see on every side arising,
embitter hours which would otherwise be
exquisitely happy.</P>
<P>The narrowness of my fortune, which
I see in a much stronger light in this land
of luxury, and the apparent impossibility
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
of placing the most charming of women
in the station my heart wishes, give me
anxities which my reason cannot con∣quer.</P>
<P>I cannot live without her, I slatter my∣self
our union is in some degree necessary
to her happiness; yet I dread bringing
her into distresses, which I am doubly
obliged to protect her from, because she
would with transport meet them all, from
tenderness to me.</P>
<P>I have nothing which I can call my
own, but my half-pay, and four thou∣fand
pounds: I have lived amongst the
first company in England; all my con∣nexions
have been rather suited to my
birth than fortune. My mother presses
me to resume my state, and let her live
with us alternately; but against this I
am firmly determined; she shall have her
own house, and never change her manner
of living.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171"/>
Temple would share his estate with
me, if I would allow him; but I am too
fond of independence to accept favors of
this kind even from him.</P>
<P>I have formed a thousand schemes,
and as often found them abortive; I
go to-morrow to see our little estate,
with my mother; it is a private party
of our own, and nobody is in the se∣cret;
I will there talk over every thing
with her.</P>
<P>My mind is at present in a state
of confusion not to be expressed; I
must determine on something; it is
improper Emily should continue long
with my sister in her present situa∣tion;
yet I cannot live without seeing her.</P>
<P>I have never asked about Emily's for∣tune;
but I know it is a small one; per∣haps
two thousand pounds; I am pretty
certain, not more.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172"/>
We can live on little, but we must live
in some degree on a genteel footing: I
cannot let Emily, who reufused a coach
and six for me, pay visits on foot; I will
be content with a post-chaise, but cannot
with less; I have a little, a very little
pride, for niy Emily.</P>
<P>I wish it were possible to prevail on my
mother to return with us to Canada: I
could then reconcile my duty and happi∣ness,
which at present seem almost incom∣patible.</P>
<P>Emily appears perfectly happy, and to
look no further than to the situation in
which we now are; she seems content with
being my friend only, without thinking of
a nearer connexion; I am rather piqued at
a composure which has the air of indif∣ference:
why should not her impatience
equal mine?</P>
<P>The coach is at the door, and my mo∣ther
waits for me.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Every happiness attend my friend, and
all connected with him! in which number
I hope I may, by this time, include Fitz∣gerald.</P>

<OPENER>To Captain FERMOR, at Silleri.
<DATE>Aug. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been taking an exact survey
of the house and estate with my mo∣ther,
in order to determine on some fu∣ture
plan of life.</P>
<P>'Tis inconceivable what I felt on
returning to a place so dear to me,
and which I had not seen for many
years; I ran hastily from one room to
another; I traversed the garden with in∣expressible
eagerness: my eye devoured
every object; there was not a tree, not
a bush, which did not revive some plea∣sing,
some soft idea.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="175"/>
I felt, to borrow a very pathetic ex∣pression
of Thomson's,
<Q>“A thousand little tendernesses throb,”</Q>
on revisiting those dear scenes of in∣fant
happiness; which were increased
by having with me that estimable,
that affectionate mother, to whose in∣dulgence
all my happiness had been
owing.</P>
<P>But to return to the purpose of our
visit: the house is what most people would
think too large for the estate, even had I
a right to call it all my own; this is, how∣ever,
a fault, if it is one, which I can easi∣ly
forgive.</P>
<P>There is furniture enough in it for
my family, including my mother; it
is unfashionable, but some of it very
good: and I think Emily has tender∣ness
enough for me to live with me in
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
a house, the furniture of which is not
perfectly in taste.</P>
<P>In short, I know her much above hav∣ing
the slightest wish of vanity, where it
comes in competition with love.</P>
<P>We can, as to the house, live here
commodioufly enough; and our only pre∣sent
consideration is, on what we are to
live: a consideration, however, which as
lovers, I believe in strictness we ought
to be much above!</P>
<P>My mother again solicits me to resume
this estate; and has proposed my making
over to her my half-pay instead of it,
though of much less value, which, with
her own two hundred pounds a year, will,
she says, enable her to continue her house
in town, a point I am determined never to
suffer her to give up; because she loves
London; and because I insist on her hav∣ing
her own house to go to, if she should
ever chance to be displeased with ours.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177"/>
I am inclined to like this proposal: Tem∣ple
and I will make a calculation; and, if
we find it will answer every necessary pur∣pose
to my mother, I owe it to Emily to
accept of It.</P>
<P>I endeavor to persuade myself, that I
am obliging my mother, by giving her
an opportunity of shewing her generosity,
and of making me happy: I have been
in spirits ever since she mentioned it.</P>
<P>I have already projected a million
of improvements; have taught new
streams to flow, planted ideal groves,
and walked, fancy-led, in shades of my
own raising.</P>
<P>The situation of the house is enchant∣ing;
and with all my passion for the sa∣vage
luxuriance of America, I begin
to find my taste return for the more
mild and regular charms of my native
country.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178"/>
We have no Chaudieres, no Montmo∣rencis,
none of those magnificent scenes
on which the Canadians have a right to
pride themselves; but we excel them in
the lovely, the smiling; in enameled mea∣dows,
in waving corn-fields, in gardens
the boast of Europe; in every elegant
art which adorns and softens human life;
in all the riches and beauty which culti∣vation
can give.</P>
<P>I begin to think I may be blest in the
possession of my Emily, without betraying
her into a state of want; we may, I begin
to flatter myself, live with decency, in re∣tirement;
and, in my opinion, there are a
thousand charms in retirement with those
we love.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I believe we shall be
able to live, taking the word <HI>live</HI> in the
sense of lovers, not of the <HI>beau monde,</HI>
who will never allow a little country squire
of four hundred pounds a year to <HI>live.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179"/>
Time may do more for us; at least, I
am of an age and temper to encourage
hope.</P>
<P>All here are perfectly yours.</P>

<P>THE leave of obsence for my fa∣ther
and Fitzgerald being come
some weeks sooner than we expected, we
propose leaving Canada in five or six
days.</P>
<P>I am delighted with the idea of revi∣siting
dear England, and seeing friends
whom I so tenderly love: yet I feel a
regret, which I had no idea I should
have felt, at leaving the scenes of a
thousand past pleasures; the murmur∣ing
rivulets to which Emily and I
have sat listening, the sweet woods where
I have walked with my little circle
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
of friends: I have even a strong at∣tachment
to the scenes themselves; which
are infinitely lovely, and speak the inimi∣table
hand of nature which formed them:
I want to transport this fairy ground to
England.</P>
<P>I sigh when I pass any particularly
charming spot; I feel a tenderness
beyond what inanimate objects seem to
merit.</P>
<P>I must pay one more visit to the naiads
of Montmorenci.</P>
<P>Eleven at night.</P>
<P>I am just come from the general's as∣sembly;
where, I should have told you,
I was this day fortnight announced <HI>Madame
Fitzgerald,</HI> to the great mortifica∣tion
of two or three cats, who had very
sagaciously determined, that Fitzgerald
had too much understanding ever to
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
think of such a flirting, coquetish. crea∣ture
as a wife.</P>
<P>I was grave at the assembly to-night,
in spite of all the pains I took to be other∣wise:
I was hurt at the idea it would pro∣bably
be <HI>the last</HI> at which I should be; I
felt a kind of concern at parting, not only
with the few I loved, but with those who
had till to-night been indifferent to me.</P>
<P>There is something affecting in the idea
of <HI>the last time</HI> of seeing even those per∣sons
or places, for which we have no par∣ticular
affection.</P>
<P>I go to-morrow to take leave of the
nuns, at the Ursuline convent; I sup∣pose
I shall carry this melancholy idea with
me there, and be hurt at seeing them too
<HI>for the last time.</HI></P>
<P>I pay visits every day amongst the pea∣sants,
who are very fond of me. I talk to
them of their farms, give money to their
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
children, and teach their wives to be good
huswives: I am the idol of the country
people five miles round, who declare me
the most amiable, most generous woman
in the world, and think it a thousand
pities I should be damned.</P>
<P>Adieu! Say every thing for me to my
sweet friends, if arrived.</P>
<P><DATE>7th,</DATE> Eleven o'clock.</P>

<P>Three o'clock.</P>
<P>I am just come from visiting the nuns;
they expressed great concern at my leaving
Canada, and promised me their prayers
on my voyage; for which proof of affec∣tion,
though a good protestant, I thanked
them very sincerely.</P>
<P>I wished exceedingly to have brought
some of them away with me; my nun, as
they call the amiable girl I saw take the
veil, paid me the flattering tribute of a
tear at parting; her fine eyes had a con∣cern
in them, which affected me ex∣tremely.</P>
<P>I was not less pleased with the affecction
the late superior, my good old country∣woman,
expressed for me, and her regret
at seeing me <HI>for the last time.</HI></P>
<P>Surely there is no pleasure on earth
equal to that of being beloved! I did not
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
think I had been such a favorite in Ca∣nada:
it is almost a pity to leave it; per∣haps
nobody may love me in England.</P>

<P>I had only Fitzgerald with me; we

where we dined; kissed every flower,
raised a votive altar on the little island,
poured a libation of wine to the river
goddess; and, in short, did every thing
which it became good heathens to do.</P>
<P>We stayed till day-light began to de∣cline,
which, with the idea of <HI>the last time,</HI>
threw round us a certain melancholy so∣lemnity;
a solemnity which
<Q><L>“Deepen'd the murmur of the falling

a pair of extreme pretty bracelets; has
sent your brother an elegant sword-knot,
and Emily a very beautiful cross of dia∣monds.</P>
<P>I don't believe she would be sorry if we
were to run away with her to England:
I protest I am half inclined; it is pity
such a woman should be hid all her life in
the woods of Canada: besides, one might
convert her you know; and, on a reli∣gious
principle, a little deviation from
rules is allowable.</P>

Your brother is an admirable missionary
amongst unbelieving ladies: I really think
I shall carry her off; if it is only for the
good of her soul.</P>
<P>I have but one objection; if Fitzgerald
should take a fancy to prefer the tender to
the lively, I should be in some danger:
there is something very seducing in her
eyes, I assure you.</P>

<DATELINE>Kamaraskas, <DATE>Aug. 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BY Madame Des Roches, who is going
on shore, I write two or three lines,
to tell you we have got thus far, and have
a fair wind; she will send it immediately
to Quebec, to be put on board any ship
going, that you may have the greater va∣riety
of chances to hear of me.</P>
<P>There is a French lady on board, whose
superstition bids fair to amuse us; she has
thrown half her little ornaments over∣board
for a wind, and has promised I
know not how many votive offerings of the
same kind to St. Joseph, the patron of
Canada, if we get safe to land; on which
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
I shall only observe, that there is nothing
so like ancient absurdity as modern: she
has classical authority for this manner of
playing the fool; Horace, when afraid on
a voyage, having, if my memory quotes
fair, vowed
<Q><L>“His dank and dropping weeds</L>
<L>To the stern god of sea.”</L></Q></P>
<P>The boat is ready, and Madame Des
Roches going; I am very unwilling to part
with her; and her present concern at leav∣ing
me would be very flattering, if I did
not think the remembrance of your bro∣ther
had the greatest share in it.</P>
<P>She has wrote four or five letters to him,
since she came on board, very tender ones
I fancy, and destroyed them; she has at
last wrote a meer complimentary kind of
card, only thanking him for his offers of
service; yet I see it gives her pleasure to
write even this, however cold and formal;
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
because addressed to him: she asked me,
if. I thought there was any impropriety
in her writing to him, and whether it
would not be better to address herself to
Emily. I smiled at her simplicity, and
she finished her letter; she blushed and
looked down when she gave it me.</P>
<P>She is less like a sprightly French wi∣dow,
than a foolish English girl, who loves
for the first time.</P>
<P>But I suppose, when the heart is really
touched, the feelings of all nations have
a pretty near resemblance: it is only that
the French ladies are generally more co∣quets,
and less inclined to the romantic
style of love, than the English; and we are,
therefore, surprized when we find in them
this trembling sensibility.</P>
<P>There are exceptions, however, to all
rules; and your little Bell seems, in point
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
of love, to have changed countries with
Madame Des Roches.</P>
<P>The gale encreases, it flutters in the
sails; my fair friend is summoned; the
captain chides our delay.</P>
<P>Adieu! <HI>ma chere Madame Des Roches.</HI>
I embrace her; I feel the force of its
being <HI>for the last time.</HI> I am afraid she
feels it yet more strongly, than I do:
in parting with the last of his friends,
she seems to part with her Rivers for
ever.</P>
<P>One look more at the wild graces of
nature I leave behind.</P>
<P>Adieu! Canada! adieu! sweet a∣bode

<P>YOU are little obliged to me, my
dear, for writing to you on ship∣board;
one of the greatest miseries here,
being the want of employment: I there∣fore
write for my own amusement, not
yours.</P>
<P>We have some French ladies on board,
but they do not resemble Madame Des
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Roches. I am weary of them already,
though we have been so few days toge∣ther.</P>
<P>The wind is contrary, and we are at an∣chor
under this island; Fitzgerald has
proposed going to dine on shore: it looks
excessively pretty from the ship.</P>
<P>Seven in the Evening.</P>
<P>We are returned from Bic, after passing
a very agreeable day.</P>
<P>We dined on the grass, at a little dis∣rance
from the shore, under the shelter of
a very fine wood, whose form, the trees
rising above each other in the same regu∣lar
confusion, brought the dear shades of
Silleri to our remembrance.</P>
<P>We walked after dinner, and picked
rasberries, in the wood; and in our ram∣ble
came unexpectedly to the middle of a
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
visto, which, whilst some ships of war lay
here, the sailors had cut through the
island.</P>
<P>From this situation, being a rising
ground, we could see directly through the
avenue to both shores: the view of each
was wildly majestic; the river comes finely
in, whichever way you turn your sight;
but to the south, which is more sheltered,
the water just trembling to the breeze,
our ship which had put all her streamers
out, and to which the tide gave a gentle
motion, with a few scattered houses, faintly
seen amongst the trees at a distance, ter∣minated
the prospect, in a manner which
was inchanting.</P>
<P>I die to build a house on this island; it
is pity such a sweet spot should be unin∣habited:
I should like excessively to be
Queen of Bic.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald has carved my name on a
maple, near the shore; a pretty piece of
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
gallantry in a husband, you will allow:
perhaps he means it as taking possession
for me of the island.</P>
<P>We are going to cards. Adieu! for

<P>“Tis one of the loveliest days I ever
saw: we are fishing under the Magdalen
islands; the weather is perfectly calm,
the sea just dimpled, the sun-beams dance
on the waves, the fish are playing on the
surface of the water: the island is at a
proper distance to form an agreeable point
of view; and upon the whole the scene is
divine.</P>
<P>There is one house on the island, which,
at a distance, seems so beautifully situated,
that I have lost all desire of fixing at Bic:
I want to land, and go to the house for
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
milk, but there is no good landing-place
on this side; the island seems here to be
fenced in by a regular wall of rock.</P>
<P>A breeze springs up; our fishing is at
an end for the present: I am afraid we
shall not pass many days so agreeably as

<P>WE have just fallen in with a ship
from New York to London, and,
as it is a calm, the master of it is come
on board; whilst he is drinking a bottle
of very, fine Madeira, which Fitzgerald
has tempted him with on purpose to give
me this opportunity, as it is possible he
may arrive first, I will write a line, to tell
my dear Lucy we are all well, and hope
soon to have the happiness of telling her
so in person; I also send what I scribbled
before we lost sight of land; for I have
had no spirits to write or do any thing
since.</P>
<P>There is inexpressible pleasure in meet∣ing
a ship at sea, and renewing our com∣merce
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
merce with the human kind, after having
been so absolutely separated from them.
I feel strongly at this moment the incon∣stancy
of the species: we naturally grow
tired of the company on board our own
ship, and fancy the people in every one
we meet more agreeable.</P>
<P>For my part, this spirit is so power∣ful
in me, that I would gladly, if I
could have prevailed on my father and
Fitzgerald, have gone on board with
this man, and pursued our voyage in the
New York ship. I have felt the same
thing on land in a coach, on seeing ano∣ther
pass.</P>
<P>We have had a very unpleasant passage
hitherto, and weather to fright a better
failor than your friend: it is to me asto∣nishing,
that there are men found, and
those men of fortune too, who can fix on
a sea life as a profession.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200"/>
How strong must be the love of gain,
to tempt us to embrace a life of danger,
pain, and misery; to give up all the beau∣ties
of naturea and of art, all the charms
of society, and separate ourselves from
mankind, to amass wealth, which the
very profession takes away all possibility
of enjoying!</P>
<P>Even glory is a poor reward for a life
passed at sea.</P>
<P>I had rather be a peasant on a funny
bank, with peace, safety, obscurity,
bread, and a little garden of roses, than
lord high admiral of the British fleet.</P>
<P>Setting aside the variety of dangers at
sea, the time passed there is a total sus∣pension
of one's existence: I speak of
the best part of our time there, for at
least a third of every voyage is positive
misery.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"/>
I abhor the sea, and am peevish with
every creature about me.</P>
<P>If there were no other evil attending
this vile life, only think of being cooped
up weeks together in such a space, and

<P>YOUR letter, my dear Bell, was sent
by this post to the country.</P>
<P>It is unneces sary to tell you the plea∣sure
it gives us all to hear of your safe
arrival.</P>
<P>All our argosies have now landed
their treasures: you will believe us to
have been more anxious about friends
so dear to us, than the merchant for his
gold and spices; we have suffered the
. greater anxiety, by the circumstance
. of your having returned at different
times.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"/>
I flatter myself, the future will pay us
for the past.</P>
<P>You may now, my dear Bell, re∣vive
your coterie, with the addition of
some friends who love you very sin∣cerely.</P>
<P>Emily (still Emily Montague) is with
a relation in Berkshire, settling some
affairs previous to her marriage with
my brother, to which we flatter our∣selves
there will be no further objec∣tions.</P>
<P>I as sure you, I begin to be a little jea∣lous
of this Emily of yours; she rivals me
extremely with my mother, and indeed
with every body else.</P>
<P>We all come to town next week, when
you will make us very unhappy if you
do not become one of our family in Pall
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
Mall, and return with us for a few months
to the country.</P>
<P>My brother is at his little estate, six
miles from hence, where he is. Making
some alterations, for the. reception of
Emily; he is sitting up her apartment
in a style equally simple and elegant,
which, however, you must not tell her,
because she is to be surprized: her dres∣sing
room, and a little adjoining closet
of books, will be enchanting: yet the
expence of all he has done is a mere
trifle.</P>
<P>I am the only person in the secret;
and have been with him this morning to
see it: there is a gay, smiling air in the
whole apartment, which pleases me infi∣nitely;
you will suppose he does not
forget jars of flowers, because you know
how much they are Emily's taste: he has
forgot no ornament which he knew was
agreeable to her.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207"/>
Happily for his fortune, her pleasures
are not of the expensive kind; he would
ruin himself if they were.</P>
<P>He has bespoke a very handsome post
chaise, which is also a scret to Emily,
who insists on not having one.</P>
<P>Their income will be about five hun∣dred
pounds a year: it is not much;
yet, with their dispositions, I think it will
make them happy.</P>
<P>My brother will write to Mr. Fitzge∣rald
next post: say every thing affectionate
for us all to him and Captain Fermor.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Sept. 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you, my dear
friend, on your safe arrival, and on
your marriage.</P>
<P>You have got the start of me in happi∣ness;
I love you, however, too sincerely
to envy you.</P>
<P>Emily has promised me her hand, as
soon as some little family affairs are settled,
which I flatter myself will not take above
another week.</P>
<P>When she gave me this promise, she
begged me to allow her to return toBerk∣shire
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
till our marriage took place; I felt
the propriety of this step, and therefore
would not oppose it: she pleaded having
some business also to settle with her rela∣tion
there.</P>
<P>My mother has given back the deed
of settlement of my estate, and accepted
of an as signment on my half-pay: she
is greatly a loser; but she insisied on
making me happy, with such an air of
tenderness, that I could not deny her
that satisfaction.</P>
<P>I shall keep some land in my own
hands, and farm; which will enable
me to have a post-chaise for Emily, and
my mother, who will be a good deal
with us; and a constant decent table
for a friend.</P>
<P>Emily is to superintend the dairy
and garden; she has a pas sion for flow∣ers,
with which I am extremely pleased,
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
as. it will be to her a continual source
of pleasure.</P>
<P>I feel such delight in the idea of mak∣ing
her happy, that I think nothing a
trifle which can be in the least degree
pleasing to her.</P>
<P>I could even wish to invent. new plea∣sures
for her gratification.</P>
<P>I hope to be happy; and to make
the loveliest of womankind so because
rny notions of the state, into which I
am entering, are I hope just, and free
from that romantic turn so destructive to
happiness.</P>
<P>I have, once in my life, had an at∣tachment
nearly resembling marriage,
to a widow of rank, with whom I was
acquainted abroad; and with whom I
almost secluded myself from the world
near a. twelvemonth, when she died of
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
a fever, a stroke I was long before I
recovered.</P>
<P>I loved her with tenderness; but that
love, compared to what I feel for Emily,
was as a grain of sand to the globe of
earth, or the weight of a feather to the
universe.</P>
<P>A marriage where not only esteem, but
pas sion is kept awake, is, I am convin∣ced,
the most perfect state of sublunary
happiness: but it requires great care to
keep this tender plant alive; especially, I
blush to say it, on our side.</P>
<P>Women are naturally more constant,
education improves this happy disposI∣tion:
the husband who has the polite∣ness,
the attention, and delicacy of a lover,
will always be beloved.</P>
<P>The same is generally, but not always,
true on the other side: I have some∣times
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
seen the most amiable, the most delicate
of the sex, fail in keeping the affection of
their husbands.</P>
<P>I am well aware, my friend, that we
are not to expect here a life of continual
rapture: in the happiest marriage there
is danger of some languid moments: to
avoid these, shall be my study; and I am
certain they are to be avoided.</P>
<P>The inebriation, the tumult of pas sion,
will undoubtedly grow less after mar∣riage,
that is, after peaceable pos ses sion;
hopes and fears alone keep it in its
first violent state: but, though it sub∣sides,
it gives place to a tenderness still
more pleasing, to a soft, and, if you
will allow the expres sion, a voluptuous
tranquillity: the pleasure does not cease,
does not even les sen; it only changes
its nature.</P>
<P>My sister tells me, she flatters herself,
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
you will give a few months to hers
and Mr. Temple's friendship; I will
not give up the claim I have to the
same favor.</P>
<P>My little farm will induce only friends
to visit us; and it is not less pleasing to
me for that circumstance: one of the
misfortunes of a very exalted station, is
the slavery it subjects us to in regard to
the ceremonial world.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I believe, the most
agreeable, as well as most free of all situ∣ations,
to be that of a little country
gentleman, who lives upon his income,
and knows enough of the world not to
envy his richer neighbours.</P>
<P>Let me hear from you, my dear Fitz∣gerald,
and tell me, if, little as I am,
I can be any way of the least use to
you.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214"/>
You will see Emily before I do; she
is more lovely, more enchanting, than
ever.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald will make me happy if
she can invent any commands for me.</P>

<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Bellfield, Rutland.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Sept. 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY mark of your friendship, my
dear Rivers, must be particularly
pleasing to one who knows your worth as
I do: I have, therefore, to thank you as
well for your letter, as for those obliging
offers of service, which I shall make no
scruple of accepting, if I have occasion
for them.</P>
<P>I rejoice in the prospect of your being
as happy as myself: nothing can be more
just than your ideas of marriage; I mean,
of a marriage sounded on inclination: all
that you describe, I am so happy as to ex∣perience.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"/>
I never loved my sweet girl. so tenderly
as since she has been mine; my heart ac∣knowledges
the obligation of her having
trusted the future happiness or misery of
her life in my hands. She is every hour
more dear to me; I value as I ought those
thousand little attentions, by which a new
softness is every moment given to our af∣fection.</P>
<P>I do not indeed feel the same tumul∣tuous
emotion at seeing her; but I feel a
sensation equally delightful: a joy more
tranquil, but not less lively.</P>
<P>I will own to you, that I had strong
prejudices against marriage, which nothing
but love could have conquered; the idea
of an indis soluble union deterred me from
thinking of a serious engagement: I at∣tached
myself to the most seducing, most
attractive of women, without thinking the
pleasure I found in seeing her of any con∣sequence:
I thought her lovely, but never
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
suspected I loved; I thought the delight
I tasted in hearing her, merely the effects
of those charms which all the world
found in her conversation; my vanity
was gratified by the flattering preference
she gave me to the rest of my sex; I
fancied this all, and imagined I could
cease seeing the little syren whenever I
pleased.</P>
<P>I was, however, mistaken; love stole
upon me imperceptibly, and <HI>en badinant;</HI>
I was enslaved, when I only thought my∣self
amused.</P>
<P>We have not yet seen Miss Montague;
we go down on Friday to Berkshire, Bell
having some letters for her, which she was
desired to deliver herself.</P>
<P>I will write to you again the moment I
have seen her.</P>
<P>The invitation Mr. and Mrs. Temple
have been so obliging as to give us, is too
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
pleasing to ourselves not to be accepted;
we also expect with impatience the time
of visiting you at your farm.</P>

<DATELINE>Stamford, <DATE>Sept. 16,</DATE> Evening.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEING here on some business, my
dear friend, I receive your letter in
time to answer it to-night.</P>
<P>We hope to be in town this day seven∣night;
and I flatter myself, my dearest
Emily will not delay my happiness many
days longer: I grudge you the pleasure
of seeing her on Friday.</P>
<P>I triumph greatly in your having been
seduced into matrimony, because I never
knew a man more of a turn to make an
agreeable husband; it was the idea that
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
occurred to me the first moment I saw
you.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear Fitzgerald,
that, if your little syren had not antici∣pated
my purpose, I had designs upon you
for my sister?</P>
<P>Through that careless, inattentive look
of yours, I saw so much right sense, and
so affectionate a heart, that I wished no∣thing
so much as that she might have
attached you; and had laid a scheme to
bring you acquainted, hoping the rest
from the merit so conspicuous in you
both.</P>
<P>Both are, however, so happily dis∣posed
of elsewhere, that I have no
reason to regret my scheme did not suc∣ceed.</P>
<P>There is something in your person,
as well as manner, which I am con∣vinced
must be particularly pleasing
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
to women; with an extremely agree∣able
form, you have a certain manly,
spirited air, which promises them a
protector; a look of understanding,
which is the indication of a pleas∣ing
companion; a sensibility of coun∣tenance,
which speaks a friend and a
lover; to which I ought to add, an
affectionate, constant attention to women,
and a polite indifference to men, which
above all things flatters the vanity of the
sex.</P>
<P>Of all men breathing, I should have
been most afraid of you as a rival; Mrs.
Fitzgerald has told me, you have said the
same thing of me.</P>
<P>Happily, however, our tastes were
different; the two amiable objects of
our tenderness were perhaps equally
lovely; but it is not the meer form,
it is the character that strikes: the
fire, the spirit, the vivacity, the a∣wakened
manner, of Miss Fermor
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
won you; whilst my heart was cap∣tivated
by that bewitching languor,
that seducing softness, that melting
sensibility, in the air of my sweet Emi∣ly,
which is, at least to me, more
touching than all the sprightliness in the
world.</P>
<P>There is in true sensibility of soul, such
a resistless charm, that we are even affected
by that of which we are not ourselves the
object: we feel a degree of emotion at
being witness to the affection which ano∣ther
inspires.</P>
<P>“Tis late, and my horses are at the
door.</P>
