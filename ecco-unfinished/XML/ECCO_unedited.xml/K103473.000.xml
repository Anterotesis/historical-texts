FACTS
Occasionally mention'd in the

Confirmed by PASSAGES of
ANCIENT AUTHORS,
Who were contemporary with our

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT ever argument is in∣sisted
on in behalf of Chri∣stianity,
whether the purity
of its doctrine, the fulfil∣ment
of ancient prophecies,
the predictions and miracles
of our Saviour and his Apostles, or the pecu∣liar
circumstances of its propagation, it is
necessary that we be apprized of the truth of
the things related in the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>THE evidence of the truth of any histo∣ry
is either internal or external. The inter∣nal
evidence depends on the probability of
the things related, the consistence of the se∣veral
parts, and the plainnesse and simplicity
of the narration. The external evidence con∣sists
of the concurrence of other ancient wri∣ters
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
of good credit, who lived at or near the
time in which any things are said to have
happened; and who bear testimony to the
books themselves, their Authors, or the facts
contained in them.</P>
<P>EVERY serious and attentive reader is
able, in a great measure, to judge of the in∣ternal
marks of credibility of the history con∣tained
in the <HI>New Testament:</HI> though he may
be very much assisted by the observations of
those who are more curious or judicious than
himself. And for this purpose many excel∣lent
writings have been published with very
great advantage in our own and other modern
languages.</P>
<P>THE external evidence of the truth of a∣ny
ancient history, and particularly of the <HI>Go∣spel-History,</HI>
lies not so much within the
reach of the generality of mankind. And
though in some modern defenses of the Chri∣stian
Religion there have been appeals and re∣ferences
made to other ancient authors; yet
those appeals have not been so distinct, full,
and express, as might have been wished.
The writer has supposed his reader learned,
and not producing at length the testimonies
he appeals to, the faith of the unlearned, as
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
to this part of the evidence for Christianity,
is still resolved very much into the credit and
authority of the Apologist.</P>
<P>THE peculiar design of this work is to en∣able
persons of ordinary capacities, who, for
want of a learned education, or of sufficient
leisure, are deprived of the advantage of read∣ing
over ancient writings, to judge for them∣selves
concerning the <HI>external</HI> evidence of the
facts related in the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>AT present I offer only the evidence of the
facts <HI>Occasionally</HI> mentioned in the books of
the <HI>New Testament;</HI> intending hereafter to
treat of the <HI>Principal</HI> facts in a like manner.</P>
<P>THE method taken in this work is to set
down in the first place the representation
which the sacred Writers have given of Per∣sons,
Facts, Customs, or Principles, and then
to produce passages of other Ancient Writers,
which confirm or illustrate the account deli∣vered
in the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREVER the matter treated of is of
any special importance, or wherever there is
any ambiguity, or any peculiar beauty or em∣phasis
in the stile and expression of the Au∣thors
I quote, I have placed their original
words at the bottom of the Page.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
THERE are added likewise, here and there,
some short notes for the benefit of the un∣learned
reader. These are referred to by small
Capitals; and I hope will be distinguished
from the original quotations, which are mark∣ed
with small letters.</P>
<P>I PRESUME it is needless for me to ac∣knowledge
particularly, that I am accountable
for the translations of all the Passages here tran∣scribed:
or to declare, that I have used the
best care I could about them. I may have
mistaken, but I am sure, that I have not,
with a view to any particular purpose what∣ever,
designedly misrepresented any fact, or
given a wrong turn to any passage. My put∣ting
down the original words of my authors,
or very particular references to them, will
prevent all suspicions of this kind.</P>
<P>THE reader is not to suppose, that I have
exhausted the argument. The geography of
the <HI>New Testament,</HI> and many facts, customs
and principles; beside those here insisted on by
me, are also confirmed by testimonies of an∣cient
Writers. I apprehend however, that
what is here offered is sufficient to answer the
end proposed. And tho' the positive part be
not full and compleat, and indeed could not
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
be so without being tedious; yet I think I have
in the second book, taken in all the chief dif∣ficulties
affecting that kind of facts I am now
concerned with.</P>
<P>THE point I was to make out is the credi∣bility
of the <HI>Gospel-History.</HI> And to that I
have confined myself. But no one may hence
surmise, that I give up the inspiration of the
books of the <HI>New Testament.</HI> Nor am I
aware, that I have in the lest weakened any
argument, that they were written under a
special direction and influence of the Spirit of
God. I think however, that if the Gospel-History
be credible, the truth of the Christian
Religion cannot be contested.</P>
<P>I FLATTER myself, my design will be ap∣proved.
I wish the execution had been equal
to the Subject. Imperfect as it is, I hope what
is here performed may be of use to remove,
or abate the prejudices of some, to confirm
others upon a good foundation in the belief of
the Christian Religion, and in their high
esteem for the Writers of the <HI>New Testament,</HI>
and to enable them to read them with new
pleasure and profit.</P>

<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>Having in the following work made great
use of Philo and Josephus, I here pre∣fix
a short account of those two writers.</HEAD>
<P>PHILO was a <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>E∣gypt,</HI>
brother<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiq. 18. c. 9. §. 1.</NOTE> of <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Ala∣barch</HI>
or chief magistrate of the <HI>Jews</HI> in that
country. They having been much abused by
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and by <HI>Flaccus</HI> the Roman Presi∣dent;
in the year of our Lord 39 or 40, <HI>Philo</HI>
with others was sent to <HI>Caligula</HI> the Emperour
in the name of the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> people living
in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The ambassy consisted of<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Philo. de legat. p. 1043. C.</NOTE>
five, and he<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1018. C.</NOTE> has assured us himself, that he
was the eldest and most experienced person
among them. It is reasonable to conclude there∣fore,
that he was born at, or before the com∣mencement
of the Christian <HI>Aera.</HI> He was
eminent for his wit and learning, as well as for
his family. Many of his writings are still re∣maining,
tho' some have been lost. The two
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
books which I have chiefly quoted are his dis∣course
against the forementioned <HI>Flaccus,</HI> Pre∣sident
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and his account of the <HI>Ambas∣sy
to</HI> Caligula.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS,</HI> the Son of <HI>Matthias,</HI> of
the race of the Priests, by his mother descend∣ed
from the <HI>Asmonean</HI> family, which for a
considerable time had the supreme government
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation, was born at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
in the first year of the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In vit. §. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI>
A. D. 37. In the beginning of the <HI>Jewish</HI> war
he commanded in <HI>Galilee. Vespasian,</HI> then
General under <HI>Nero,</HI> having conquered that
country, <HI>Josephus</HI> became his prisoner, and
continued with him as long as <HI>Vespasian</HI> staid
in those parts. When <HI>Vespasian,</HI> being declar∣ed
Emperour, went to <HI>Rome</HI> to take possession
of the Empire, <HI>Josephus</HI> staid with <HI>Titus,</HI> was
present at the Siege of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and saw the
ruine of his City and Country. <HI>Josephus</HI> af∣terwards
settled at <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtained the
freedom of the City from <HI>Vespasian.</HI> Some
time after the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he
wrote his history of the <HI>Jewish War</HI> in seven
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
books. After that he wrote in twenty books
the <HI>Jewish Antiquities,</HI> or, History of the
<HI>Jews</HI> from the creation of the world to the
twelfth of <HI>Nero,</HI> in which year the War be∣gan.
This work he finished in the 56th year
of his own age, in the 13th year of the reign
of <HI>Domitian,</HI> A. D. 93. Beside these, we have
his <HI>Life,</HI> writ by himself, and two books
against <HI>Apion</HI> an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Author, who had
calumniated the <HI>Jewish</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Antiq. 20. c. 10. Vit. §. 75, 76. De Bell. in Proem.</NOTE> people. The
works of <HI>Philo</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI> were writ in the
<HI>Greek</HI> language.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
Concerning the
SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> NOW allow, that the words of St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> ch. ii. 2. are capable of the sense,
in which they are understood by <HI>Her∣waert</HI>
and <HI>Perizonius.</HI> But as I still
dispute most of the examples alledged
by those learned men in support of that sense, there
is but a small alteration made in that article. The
Reverend Mr. <HI>Masson</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Slaughter of the children in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> as an histori∣cal fact, vindicated <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the dedication to the Bishop of <HI>Coven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield.</HI></NOTE> has given me occasion to
consider afresh what I had said concerning <HI>Ma∣crobius</HI>'s
passage. I hope, what is now added will
be to his and others satisfaction. I have also taken
this opportunity to add some farther observations
on <HI>Josephus</HI>'s silence about the slaughter of the
Infants at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> But the most important ad∣dition
is a curious observation on <HI>Josephus</HI> con∣cerning
the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Impostor, which I received
from Mr. <HI>Ward.</HI> These and the few other alterations
and additions made in this edition can need no apo∣logy
with those who understand the nature of this
design. And as they are printed by themselves, and
may be had separate, I hope the first edition is not
much prejudiced hereby.</P>

<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE History of the <HI>New Testament</HI> hath,
in an eminent degree, all the internal
marks and characters of credibility. The
writers appear honest and impartial. They
seem to have set down very fairly the ex∣ceptions
and reflexions of enemies, and to have re∣corded
without reserve the weaknesses, mistakes, or
even greater faults, which they themselves, or any of
their own number, engaged in the same design with
them, were guilty of. There is between the four
<HI>Evangelists</HI> an harmony, hitherto unparallel'd be∣tween
so many persons, who have all writ of the
same times or events. The lesser differences, or
seeming contradictions, which are to be found in
them, only demonstrate they did not write with con∣cert.
The other parts of the <HI>New Testament</HI> concur
with them in the same Facts, and Principles. These
are things obvious to all, who read the books of the
<HI>New Testament</HI> with attention. And the more they
are read, the more conspicuous will the tokens of
credibility appear.</P>
<P>BUT it must be an additional satisfaction, to find
that these writers are supported in their narration, by
other approved authors of different characters, who
lived at or near the time in which the facts, related by
the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> are supposed to have happened.</P>
<P>IT is plainly the design of the Historians of the
<HI>New Testament</HI> to write of the actions of Jesus Christ,
chiefly those of his publick ministry; and to give an
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>
account of his death and resurrection, and of some of the
first steps, by which the Doctrine, he had taught, made
its way in the world. But though this was their main
design, and they have not undertaken to give us the
political state or history of the countries in which
these things were done; yet in the course of their
narration they have been lead unavoidably to mention
many persons of note; and to make allusions and refe∣rences
to the customs and tenets of the people, whom
Jesus Christ and his Apostles were concerned with.</P>
<P>HERE are therefore two kinds of Facts, Principal,
and Occasional. The Principal Facts are the birth,
and preaching of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist;</HI> the miraculous
conception and birth, the discourses, miracles, pre∣dictions,
crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of
Jesus Christ; the mission of the Apostles, the de∣scent
of the Holy Ghost upon them, and the other
attestations which were given to the divine authority
of Jesus Christ, and the truth of his doctrine. The
things occasionally mentioned are the estate and cha∣racter
of the Princes and Governours, in whose time
these events are placed; the state of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their
opinions, and practises, as also those of other people
to whom the Apostles came.</P>
<P>THE Facts related in the <HI>New Testament</HI> are all
(except some few mentioned in the Book of the <HI>Reve∣lations)</HI>
supposed to have come to pass before the de∣struction
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which happened in the seven∣tieth
year of the Christian <HI>Aera.</HI> And these histo∣rians
do throughout maintain the character of persons
perfectly well acquainted with the matters of which
they write.</P>
<P>Two of these books, the Gospels of <HI>Matthew</HI> and
<HI>John,</HI> bear the names of persons who are said to have
been present at a good part of those transactions,
they give an account of. <HI>Mark</HI> writes as one fully
master of his subject, and <HI>Luke</HI> (Chap. i. 3.) affirms
expresly, that he <HI>had perfect understanding of all things
from the very first,</HI> and that he was able to write in
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
order of those things he undertook to relate. In these
four pieces we have the history of between thirty and
forty years, from the vision of <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the Tem∣ple
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the Ascension of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>BESIDE these, we have also a book called the Acts
of the Apostles, ascribed to the last mentioned writer;
in which is contain'd the history of many wonderful
events, which followed the resurrection, and ascension
of Jesus Christ. If he had perfect understanding of
all things from the very beginning of the Gospel of
Christ, he may be well supposed throughly acquaint∣ed
with these later events, as nearer his own time.
And indeed in a great part of this work he sustains
the character of an Eye-witness.</P>
<P>OMITTING, for the present, the particular con∣sideration
of the Principal Facts of this history, and
the direct and positive attestations given to the truth
of them (as well as to the genuinesse of these writings)
by a great number of persons, who lived near the time
in which they are supposed to have happened; and who
after a serious and diligent enquiry were convinced of
the truth of them, and upon the ground of that perswa∣sion
renounced the principles of their education, and
ever after constantly maintained and profess'd the truth
of the facts and principles contain'd in these books,
with great hazard of their ease, reputation, estates and
lives; I shall now take a view of those Facts only,
which are occasionally mentioned in the <HI>New Testa∣ment;</HI>
and enquire into the external evidences of the
truth of them.</P>
<P>IF it appear from other writers, that our Sacred
Historians have mistaken the people and affairs of the
time, in which, according to their own account, the
things they relate, happened; it will be an argument
that they did not write till some considerable time af∣terwards.
But if upon enquiry there be found an
agreement between them and other writers, of un∣doubted
authority, not in some few, but in many, in
all the particulars of this kind which they have men∣tioned;
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
it will be a very strong presumption that they
wrote at, or very near the time, in which the things
they relate are said to have happened.</P>
<P>THIS will give credit to the other, the main parts
of their narration. An history writ and published near
the time of any events is credible, unless there appear
some particular views of interest; of which there is no
evidence in the present case, but quite the contrary.</P>
<P>THE history now before us is the history of many
great and wonderful works, done in some of the best
peopled and most frequented parts of the earth. They
are related with very particular circumstances of time
and place, and some of them are said to have been done
in the presence of great numbers of people. Here is
withal an account of proceedings and sentences of
Courts of Judicature, in cities of the first rank, at
times of the greatest and most general resort; and of
some discourses made before persons (next under the
<HI>Roman Emperour)</HI> of the highest rank and distinction.
One manifest design of the whole is to overthrow the
religious tenets, then generally received in the world.
It is writ in the language, not of some obscure kingdom,
but of a learned and numerous people, understood at
that time by all the polite, and by many others in
every part of the known world. For any men to pub∣lish
such an history of such things as lately done, if
not punctually true, could have been only to expose
themselves to an easy confutation, and certain infamy.</P>
<P>I propose therefore to give a long enumeration of
particulars, occasionally mentioned by the Writers of
the <HI>New Testament,</HI> in which they are supported by
Authors of the best note; and then in answer to divers
objections, I shall endeavour to shew, that they are not
contradicted in the rest.</P>
<P>IF I succeed in this attempt, here will be a good ar∣gument
for the genuinesse of these Writings, and for the
truth of the Principal Facts contained in them; distinct
from the express and positive testimonies of Christian
writers, and the concessions of many others.</P>

that <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Heathen</HI> authors have
made mention of <HI>Herod, Archelaus,

note, whose names we meet with in the
<HI>Gospels</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and
have delivered nothing material concerning their cha∣racters,
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>
posts, or honours, that is different from what
the writers of the <HI>New Testament</HI> have said of them.</P>
<P>§. I. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. ii.] assures us that <HI>Jesus was
born in</HI> Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea <HI>in the Days of</HI> Herod,
<HI>the King,</HI> whom St. <HI>Luke</HI> [Ch. i. 5.] stiles expresly
<HI>the King of</HI> Judea. <HI>Herod</HI> was the Son of <HI>Antipater,</HI>
who had enjoyed considerable posts of honour and
trust under <HI>Alexander Iannaeus,</HI> and <HI>Alexandra,</HI> his wife
and successor in the civil government of <HI>Judea,</HI> and
their eldest Son <HI>Hyrcanus;</HI> who was High-Priest in his
mother's life-time, and after her death, had the civil
Power also united in him.</P>
<P><HI>NICOLAS</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI> says, that <HI>Antipater</HI>
was descended from one of the chief of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
families that returned into <HI>Judea</HI> from <HI>Babylon.</HI> But
<HI>Josephus</HI> makes no scruple to declare, that <HI>Nicolas</HI>
said this, only to flatter <HI>Herod</HI> who came to be king
of <HI>Judea;</HI> and that in truth He was an <HI>Idumean.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. lib. 14. cap. I. §. 3. Edit. Huds.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Idumeans</HI> were a branch of the ancient
<HI>Edomites,</HI> who, as Dr. <HI>Prideaun</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Connection, Part II. Book iii. p. 199. Oct. Edit. 1718.</NOTE> has observed,
“While the <HI>Jews</HI> were in <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity,
and their land lay desolate, took possession of as
much of the sorthern part of it, as contain'd what
had formerly been the whole inheritance of the
tribe of <HI>Simeon,</HI> and also half of that, which had
been the inheritance of the tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> and
there dwelt ever after—till at length going over
into the religion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they became incor∣porated
with them into the same Nation”.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> gives this account of their con∣version.
“<HI>Hyrcanus</HI> took also <HI>Adora</HI> and <HI>Marissa,</HI>
cities of <HI>Idumea:</HI> And having subdued all the
<HI>Idumeans,</HI> he permitted them to remain in the
country, upon condition they would be circum∣cised,
and use the <HI>Jewish</HI> laws. Rather that leave
their native land, they received circumcision, and
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>
submitted to live in every respect as <HI>Jews.</HI> And
from that time they became <HI>Jews</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. lib. 13. cap. 9. § 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS happened in the 129th year before the
Christian Aera<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prideaus Conn. Part II. Book v. p. 307.</NOTE>. Consequently <HI>Herod</HI> was a <HI>Jew,</HI>
though not of the ancient stock of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>

And the <HI>Jews</HI> themselves allowed <HI>Herod</HI> to be
a <HI>Jew.</HI> Whilst <HI>Felix</HI> was procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI>
“there arose a dispute between the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Syrians</HI>
that dwelt in <HI>Cesarea</HI> concerning the equal rights
of Citizenship. The <HI>Jews</HI> thought they ought

<P><HI>HEROD</HI> obtained the crown of <HI>Judea</HI> upon
occasion of a difference between two branches of the
<HI>Asmonean</HI> family. <HI>Hyrcanus</HI> had been for a con∣siderable
time Prince and High Priest of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
Nation. But whilst the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was in an
unsettled state after the death of <HI>Julius Coesar, An∣tigonus,</HI>
son of <HI>Aristobulus</HI> brother of <HI>Hyrcanus,</HI> by
means of some friends he had amost the <HI>Jews,</HI> and
by the assistance of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> made himself
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
master of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and all <HI>Judea,</HI> and took <HI>Hyr∣canus</HI>
prisoner, who was put into the hands of the
<HI>Parthians</HI><NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">In the year before the <HI>Christian Aera.</HI> 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HEREUPON, <HI>Herod,</HI> who had been Governour
of <HI>Galilee</HI> under <HI>Hyrcanus,</HI> and whose interests had
hitherto depended entirely upon him, set sail for
<HI>Rome.</HI> All he then aim'd at, was to obtain the
kingdom for <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> brother of his wife <HI>Ma∣riamne,</HI>
by his father grandson of <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> and by
his mother, of <HI>Hyrcanus.</HI> But the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI>
mov'd by the recommendations of <HI>Mark Antony</HI> and
some reasons of state, conferred the kingdom of <HI>Judea</HI>
upon <HI>Hered</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. lib. 14. c. 14. de Bell. lib. 1. c. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING had this unexpected successe at <HI>Rome,</HI> he
returned with all expedition to <HI>Judea:</HI> And in about
three years time, got possession of the whole coun∣try.
<HI>Antigenus</HI> was taken prisoner, sent to <HI>Antony,</HI>
and by him put to death at <HI>Herod</HI>'s request<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. 14. cap. ult. de B. Jud lib. 1. cap. 18.</NOTE>.“He

<P>He died of a very painful and loathsome distem∣per;
in so much that, as <HI>Josephus</HI> says, “Some then
pronounced it to be a judgement of God upon him
for his many impieties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. de B. J. lib. 1. cap. 33. p. 1041. v. 6. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. lib. 7. c. 6. §. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§ II. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> informs us, that <HI>Joseph</HI> having
been some time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> by divine direction <HI>arose,
and took the young child, and his Mother, and came into
the land of</HI> Israel. <HI>But when he heard that</HI> Archelaus
<HI>did reign in</HI> Judea, <HI>in the room of his father</HI> Herod, <HI>he
was afraid to go thither: Notwithstanding, being warned
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>
of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of</HI>
Galilee, <HI>Mat.</HI> ii. 21, 22.</P>
<P>BY which words it's implied, not only, that
ARCHELAUS succeeded <HI>Herod</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> properly so
called; but also that his power did not reach over all
the <HI>land of Israel,</HI> and particularly not to <HI>Galilee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has informed us, that <HI>Herod</HI>
usually call'd <HI>the Great,</HI> by his last Will and Testa∣ment,
which he made a little before his death, ap∣pointed
<HI>Archelaus</HI> his successor in <HI>Judea,</HI> with the
title of King; and assigned the rest of his dominions
to <HI>Herod Antipas,</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> excepting only some
small part, which he gave to his sister <HI>Salome.</HI> How∣ever,
the disposal of all was left to the determination
of <HI>Augustus.</HI> This Will the Emperour ratified as to
the main parts of it; <HI>Archelaus</HI> was decreed successor
to his father in <HI>Judea, Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Idumea,</HI> with
the title of <HI>Ethnarch:</HI> but was not to have the title
of <HI>King,</HI> till he should do somewhat to deserve it.
<HI>Herod Antipas</HI> was appointed <HI>Tetrarch</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> and
<HI>Peraea,</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> of <HI>Trachontis</HI> and the neighbour∣ing
Countries<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. lib. 17. c. 8. §. 1. de Bell. lib. 1. c. 33. §. 7. 8. &amp; lib. ii. cap. 6. §. 3.—Et gentem coercitam, liberi Hero∣dis tripartiteò rexere, Tacit. Hist. lib. v. cap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Joseph</HI> returned out of <HI>Egypt</HI> immediately after
the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> I presume no one will except a∣gainst
the propriety of the expression here made use of,
that <HI>Archelaus reigned.</HI> For his father had in his last
will appointed him his successor with the title of <HI>King.</HI>
If this return out of <HI>Egypt</HI> be supposed not to have
happened, till after the decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> was passed,
by which <HI>Archelaus</HI> was forbid as yet to use the stile
of King; yet no just exception will lie against St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s
phrase. For <HI>Josephus</HI> himself, who has
given us an account of this limitation, calls <HI>Arche∣laus, the King that succeeded Herod</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. l. 18. p. 802. v. 16, 17.</NOTE>. And he has
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>
used the verb <HI>reigning</HI> concerning the duration of his
government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. de B. lib. ii. c. 7. p. 1079. vid. etiam p. 789. v. 23. &amp; p. 904. v. 20.</NOTE>. And what in one place, he calls
a <HI>Tetrarchie,</HI> in another, he calls a <HI>Kingdom</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, p. 818. v. 27. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, p. 1071. v. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> says, that <HI>when</HI> Joseph <HI>heard</HI> that
<HI>Archelaus did reign in</HI> Judea, <HI>he was afraid to go
thither.</HI> There must have been some particular rea∣son
for this fear, and for his <HI>turning aside into the parts
of</HI> Galilee, (by virtue of a pure choice of his own,
or of a new direction from heaven) though <HI>Galilee</HI>
also was in the possession of one of <HI>Herod</HI>'s sons.</P>
<P>SOME may infer from hence, that <HI>Archelaus</HI> must
have had a bad character in <HI>Judea,</HI> even in his father's
life-time. And there are divers particulars in <HI>Jose∣phus,</HI>
which may confirm such a suspicion.</P>
<P>AFTER his father's death, and before he could
set out for <HI>Rome,</HI> to obtain of <HI>Augustus</HI> the confir∣mation
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s last Will, the <HI>Jews,</HI> upon his not
granting some demands they made, became very tu∣multuous
at the Temple. And he ordered his soldiers
in among them, who slew above three thousand<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. 17. cap. 9. §. 3.</NOTE>,
which was reckoned a great piece of severity, in the
the beginning of his reign, or rather whilst he was
but a private person: for many reckoned him no
more, till the succession was confirmed by <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Archelaus</HI> went to <HI>Rome,</HI> so did <HI>Herod Antipas,</HI>
and almost all the rest of the family. When they
came thither, <HI>Herod</HI> made interest for <HI>Archelaus's</HI>
share, which was called <HI>the Kingdom:</HI> And the whole
family favoured <HI>Herod</HI>'s pretensions, “not out of any
love to him, but out of hatred to <HI>Archelaus</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="27"/>
AFTER <HI>Archelaus</HI> had left <HI>Judea,</HI> with the leave
of <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> an embassy of
fifty of the chief men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was sent to <HI>Rome</HI>
in the name of the whole Nation, with a petition to
<HI>Augustus,</HI> that they might be permitted to live ac∣cording
to their own laws under a Roman Governour:
And when they came to <HI>Rome,</HI> they were joined by
above eight thousand <HI>Jews</HI> who lived there. They
arrived before <HI>Augustus</HI> had given his sentence upon
<HI>Herod's</HI> will. When he gave <HI>Archelaus</HI> and this Em∣bassy
an Audience, none of the Royal family would
attend <HI>Archelaus</HI> to support his interest; such was
their aversion to him. “Nor did they join in with
the Embassy, being ashamed to oppose so near a
relation in the presence of <HI>Augustus</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.” Antiq. lib. 17. cap. 13. §. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“AND in the tenth year of his government,<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">A. D. 6. or 7.</NOTE>
the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans,</HI> not being
able to endure his cruelty and tyranny, presented
complaints against him to <HI>Cesar. Augustus,</HI> having
heard both sides, banished <HI>Archelaus</HI> to <HI>Vienna</HI> in
<HI>Gaul,</HI> and confiscated his treasury<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. cap. 15. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>INDEED, he seems to have been the worst of all
<HI>Herod</HI>'s sons, except <HI>Antipater,</HI> whom <HI>Herod</HI> had put
to death five days before his own decease.</P>
<P>As the Evangelists have said little concerning our
Saviour after his return out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and settlement
in <HI>Galilee,</HI> till the time of his publick ministry, when
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>
the government of <HI>Judea</HI> was in other hands, we find
no farther mention made of <HI>Archelaus</HI> by them.</P>
<P>§. III. BUT of the two other sons of <HI>Herod,</HI> between
whom the other half of his dominions was divided,
we have mention made long after this. For St. <HI>Luke</HI>
[Chap. iii. 1.] says, that when <HI>the word of God came
to</HI> John <HI>in the fifteenth year of</HI> Tiberius, HEROD
was <HI>Tetrarch of</HI> Galilee, <HI>and his brother</HI> PHILIP
<HI>Tetrarch of</HI> Iturea, <HI>and the region of</HI> Trachonitis.
That is, they were then in possession of the same
territories and titles, which were assigned them by
their father's last will, and <HI>Augustus</HI>'s decree. And it
was this same <HI>Herod</HI> Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee,</HI> to whom
our Saviour was sent by <HI>Pilate,</HI> when he was accused
before him, <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>THAT PHILIP was Tetrarch of <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> in
the fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> we are assured by <HI>Jo∣sephus,</HI>
who says, that “<HI>Philip</HI> the brother of <HI>Herod</HI>
died in the twentieth year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> when he had
governed <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> and <HI>Batanea,</HI> and <HI>Gaulanitis</HI>
thirty seven years<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Antiq. lib. 18. c. 5. §. 6.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>AND HEROD continued <HI>Tetrarch</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> till he
was remov'd by <HI>Caligula,</HI> the successor of <HI>Tiberius</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 8. §. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>§. IV. OF this HEROD some other things are related,
namely, his marrying HERODIAS, and beheading</HI> John <HI>the</HI> Baptist. <HI>These are mentioned by several of
the Evangelists.</HI> [Mat. <HI>xiv.</HI> 1—13. Mark <HI>vi.</HI> 14—29.
Luke iii. 19, 20.] <HI>I shall only set down St.</HI> Mark'<HI>s
account.</HI> For <HI>Herod</HI> had sent forth and laid hold upon
<HI>John,</HI> and bound him in prison, for <HI>Herodias</HI> sake, his
brother <HI>Philip</HI>'s wife; for he had married her. For
<HI>John</HI> said unto <HI>Herod,</HI> it is not lawful for thee to have
thy brother's wife: Therefore <HI>Herodias</HI> had a quarrel
against him, and would have killed him, but she could
not. For <HI>Herod</HI> feared <HI>John,</HI> knowing that he was a
just man and an holy, and observed him—And when
a convenient day was come, that <HI>Herod</HI> on his birth-day
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>
made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief
estates of <HI>Galilee:</HI> And when the daughter of the said
<HI>Herodias</HI> came in and danced and pleased <HI>Herod,</HI> and
them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel,
Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou wilt ask of
me, I will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom,
<HI>Mark</HI> vi. 17—23.</P>
<P>THIS unlawful marriage is recorded in <HI>Josephus.</HI>
“About this time there happened a difference be∣tween
<HI>Aretas</HI> King of <HI>Petraea,</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> upon
this occasion. <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> had married the
daughter of <HI>Aretas,</HI> and lived a considerable time
with her. But in a journey he took to <HI>Rome,</HI> he
made a visit to <HI>Herod,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Josephus</HI> here calls <HI>Herodias</HI>'s first husband <HI>Herod.</HI> The Evangelists call him <HI>Philip.</HI> This difficulty will be considered amongst the objections.</NOTE> his brother (though not
by the same mother, for <HI>Herod</HI> was born of <HI>Simon</HI>'s
the High-Priest's daughter). Here falling in love
with <HI>Herodias,</HI> the wife of the said <HI>Herod,</HI> daughter
of their brother <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> and sister of <HI>Agrippa</HI>
the Great, he ventured to make her proposals of
Marriage. She not disliking them, they agreed
together at this time, that when he was returned
from <HI>Rome,</HI> she should go and live with him. And
it was one part of their contract, that <HI>Aretas</HI>'s
daughter should be put away<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 18. c. 6. §. 1.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> speaks again of this Marriage in
another place, from which it appears likewise that
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>
<HI>Herodias</HI> had a daughter by her first husband. She
is generally supposed to be the person whose dansing
so much entertained <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch.</HI> Giving an
account of <HI>Herod</HI>'s children and grand-children he says:
“<HI>Herodias</HI> was married to <HI>Herod,</HI> son of <HI>Herod the
Great,</HI> by <HI>Mariamne</HI> daughter of <HI>Simon</HI> the High-Priest.
They had a daughter whose name was <HI>Sa∣lome,</HI>
after whose birth, <HI>Herodias,</HI> in utter viola∣tion
of the laws of her country, left her husband
then living, and married <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> of <HI>Ga∣lilee,</HI>
her husband's brother by the father's side<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be expected, I should here pro∣duce
an instance about that time, of some Lady of a
like station with <HI>Herodias</HI>'s daughter, who dansed at
a public entertainment. But I must own, I am not
furnished with any instance exactly parallel. And I
should conclude from this very Story, as related by
the Evangelists, that this danse was a very unusual, if
not a singular piece of complaisance. If it had been
a common thing, its not to be supposed that <HI>Herod</HI>
would have thought of requiting it with so large a
present as half his kingdom.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the <HI>daughter of the said Herodias,</HI> ha∣ving
received from <HI>Herod</HI> a solemn promise, confirm∣ed
by an oath, that he would give her <HI>whatsoever she
should ask of him,</HI> and she having withdrawn and ad∣vised
with her mother, <HI>came with hast unto the king,
and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by
in a charger the head of</HI> John <HI>the</HI> Baptist.—And <HI>im∣mediately
the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
head to be brought; And he went and beheaded him in
the prison. And brought his head in a charger, and
gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her
mother,</HI> Mark vi. 25, 27, 28.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31"/>
AT the time of this event it was common for
Princes to require the heads of eminent persons,
whom they ordered for execution, to be brought to
them, especially where there was any particular re∣sentment.</P>
<P>WE have an instance in <HI>Josephus,</HI> which follows the
story of this Marriage. <HI>Aretas</HI> was extremely provo∣ked
at the treatment of his daughter, and at length
a War broke out betwixt him and <HI>Herod.</HI> A battle
was fought, and <HI>Herod</HI>'s troups were defeated. “<HI>He∣rod</HI>
sent an account of this to <HI>Tiberius;</HI> and he re∣senting
the Attempt of <HI>Aretas,</HI> wrote to <HI>Vitellius</HI> to
declare War against him, with orders, that if he
were taken prisoner, he should be brought to him
in chains, and that if he were slain, his head
should be sent to him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. 19. cap. 6. §. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>AGRIPPINA,</HI> then wife of <HI>Claudius,</HI> and
mother of <HI>Nero,</HI> who was afterwards Emperour, sent
an officer to put to death <HI>Lollia Paulina,</HI> who had
been her rival for the Imperial dignity. And <HI>Dio
Cassius</HI> says, that when <HI>Lollia</HI>'s head was brought to
her, not knowing it at first, she examined it with her
own hands, till she perceived some particular feature,
by which that Lady was distinguished<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. 60. p. 686. E. Hanov. 1606. Tacit, ann. xii. cap. 22. Iis∣dem consulibus atrox odii Agrippina, ac Lolliae infensa, quod secum de matrimonio principis certavisset.—In Lolliam mittitur tribunus a quo ad mortem adigeretur.</NOTE>. I have
put down this instance, because it seems to give us
the reason of this practise among great people, name∣ly,
that they might be certain their orders had been
executed.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has represented <HI>Herodias</HI> as a wo∣man
full of ambition and envy, as having a mighty
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
influence on <HI>Herod,</HI> and able to perswade him to
things he was not of himself at all inclined to. It is
on occasion of the advancement of her own bro∣ther,
by <HI>Caligula,</HI> to the government of the coun∣tries
that had belonged to their uncle <HI>Philip;</HI> and
that not with the old title of <HI>Tetrarch</HI> which he
had, but with the more honourable character of
King<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ant. xviii. cap. vii. §. 10. fin.</NOTE>. Upon this, “<HI>Herodias,</HI> sister of <HI>Agrip∣pa,</HI>
wife of <HI>Herod Tetrarch</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> and <HI>Peraea,</HI>
envied her brother's power, when she saw him in a
more honourable station than her husband<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ibid. cap. 8. §. 1.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>The Historian proceeds to relate, that she perswaded
her husband to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> that he might obtain
the same title. He was averse at first: However at
length she prevailed upon him to undertake the Jour∣ney.
But the Emperour was so far from granting his
petition, that upon some informations he received con∣cerning
him, he took away from him the Tetrarchie of
<HI>Galilee,</HI> and gave it to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the brother of <HI>Hero∣dias,</HI>
who had been the object of her envie; and more∣over
banished <HI>Herod</HI> to <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>Gaul,</HI> whither this wife
of his also followed him. <HI>Josephus</HI> concludes his ac∣count
with this reflexion: “This punishment did
God inflict on <HI>Herodias</HI> for envying her brother,
and on <HI>Herod</HI> for following the vain counsels of a
woman<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I have set down thus much of their story here, be∣cause
it may serve to give us a clear idea how things
passed between <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> and <HI>Herodias;</HI> and
may satisfy us, the Evangelists have not been mistaken
<PB N="17" REF="33"/>
in representing her as the first mover in the barbarous
usage, which <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> met with<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> There is now in <HI>Josephus</HI>'s works a paragraph [ant. lib. 18. cap. 6. §. 2.] in which the death of <HI>John Baptist</HI> by <HI>Herod</HI> is re∣lated, though <HI>Herodias</HI> is not mentioned as the cause of it. But some learned men suspecting the genuinesse of this paragraph, I have no right to make life of it here, where I intend to produce nothing but what is unquestionably genuine. And, I think, we have no need of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§. V. I have now said what is sufficient concerning
<HI>Herod,</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> two of the princes, in whose time
St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> commenced his mini∣stry.
All the rest will be more properly considered in
some other places, except <HI>Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene;</HI>
of whom there is no<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Casaub. Exercit. in Bat. xii. 3. &amp; Vales. Annot. ad Euseb. Hist. Ec. L. 1. c. 10.</NOTE> distinct account in any of the
ancient writers, which we now have in our hands. But
if the reader will be pleased to observe some passages,
which will be produced immediately concerning the
two <HI>Agrippaes,</HI> he will be convinced there must have
been about this time some Prince of this name, who
was Tetrarch of <HI>Abilene.</HI></P>
<P>§. VI. We may now proceed to another of <HI>Herod</HI>'s
family, of whom St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given us a very remar∣kable
history.</P>
<P>NOW about that time, <HI>HEROD</HI> the king stretched
forth his hands, to vex certain of the church. And he kil∣led
<HI>James</HI> the brother of <HI>John</HI> with the sword. And be∣cause
he saw it pleased the <HI>Jews,</HI> he proceeded farther
to take <HI>Peter</HI> also. Then were the days of unleavened
bread, <HI>Acts</HI> xii. 1—3.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> calls this person <HI>Herod,</HI> by the family
name; <HI>Josephus</HI> calls him <HI>Agrippa.</HI> He was Grandson
of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. His father was <HI>Aristobulus, He∣rod</HI>'s
Son by <HI>Mariamne,</HI> Grandaughter of <HI>Hyrcanus:</HI>
And is the same person who has been already mentioned
as brother <HI>of Herodias.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives him the title of
<HI>King,</HI> and relates several acts of sovereign authority
done by him. He does not say expresly that they were
done by him at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But there are divers parti∣culars
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>
in the relation, which plainly determine <HI>that</HI> to
be the scene of action. For <HI>St. Luke</HI> observes that when
he took <HI>Peter, then were the daies of unleavened bread,</HI>
that <HI>he intended, after</HI> EASTER <HI>to bring him forth to the</HI>
PEOPLE. And that when <HI>Peter</HI> was out of prison, <HI>and
was come to himself, he said, Now know I of a surety, that
the Lord—has delivered me out of the hand of</HI> Herod,
<HI>and from all the expectation of the</HI> PEOPLE OF THE JEWS,
<HI>ver.</HI> 11. And when he had <HI>commanded the keepers to be
put to death,</HI> he went down from JUDEA <HI>to</HI> Cesarea <HI>and
there abode,</HI> ver. 19. A passage or two from <HI>Josephus</HI>
will confirm the representation St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives of <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
being <HI>King,</HI> and that of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>IT was by several steps that he was advanced to this
dignity. His first preferment was from <HI>Caligula,</HI> A. D.
37. “And sending for him to his palace he <HI>[Caligula]</HI>
put a crown upon his head, and appointed him king
of the Tetrarchie of <HI>Philip,</HI> intending also to give
him the Tetrarchie of <HI>Lysanias</HI><NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Ant. xviii. c. vii. §. 10. fin.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>HIS next preferment was the addition made by the
same Emperour, of the Tetrarchie of <HI>Galilee,</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. p. 820. v. 20. p. 1067. v. 20.</NOTE>, which
has been mentioned already. The last was what fol∣lows:
“<HI>Claudius</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Ant. 19. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 5. §. 1. vid. &amp; de B. lib. 2. cap. 10.</NOTE> by a decree confirmed to <HI>Agrippa</HI>
the dominion which <HI>Caius [Caligula]</HI> had given him;
adding also <HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> in the utmost ex∣tent
as possessed by his Grandfather <HI>Herod.</HI> This he
restored, as due to him by right of consanguinity,
and moreover, added of his own <HI>Abila,</HI> which had
been <HI>Lysanias</HI>'s, together with the country in mount
<HI>Libanus</HI>”.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> therefore confirms the representa∣tion.
St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given of <HI>Herod</HI>'s sovereign power
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>
in <HI>Judea.</HI> This is worthy of our particular notice, be∣cause
his three years reign in <HI>Judea,</HI> [the last of his life]
was the only time, in which <HI>Judea</HI> properly so called
was not a Roman Province, from the banishment of
<HI>Archelaus</HI> in the sixth or seventh year of the <HI>Christian
Aera,</HI> to the year 66, when they revolted from the
<HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says, that having <HI>killed</HI> James <HI>the brother of</HI>
John <HI>with the Sword;</HI> BECAUSE HE SAW IT PLEASED
THE JEWS, <HI>he proceeded farther, to take</HI> Peter <HI>also.</HI> That
it is very likely he should be moved by such a conside∣ration
as this, is evident from the character which <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
has given of him. <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, his Grand∣father,
he says, was continually obliging foreign States
and Cities by large bounties; but did very few things
to gratify the <HI>Jews.</HI> Whereas, “<HI>Agrippa</HI> was of a mild
and gentle disposition, and good to all men; he was
beneficent to strangers, but especially kind to the
<HI>Jews</HI> his countrymen, and sympathised with them
in all their troubles. For which reason also he lived
much at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> observed the <HI>Jewish</HI> institutions,
practised the purity they require, and did not let a
day pass without worshiping God according to the
Lawe<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 7. §. 3.</NOTE>”. This his zeal for the institutions and
customs of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and his desire to oblige that peo∣ple
very much confirm the account St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives of his
forwardnesse in persecuting the disciples of Jesus.</P>
<P>WHAT St. <HI>Luke</HI> adds concerning this person is a very
extraordinarie relation; and <HI>Josephus</HI> concurs with him
in it. <HI>And he went down from</HI> Judea <HI>to</HI> Cesarea, <HI>and
there abode—And upon a set day,</HI> Herod <HI>arayed in royal
apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration to</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>
them. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice
of a God and not of a man. And immediately the Angel
of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory,
and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost, <HI>Acts</HI>
xii. 19. 23.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI>'s words are these: “Having now
reigned three whole years over all <HI>Judea,</HI> he went
to the city <HI>Cesarea</HI> formerly called <HI>Straton</HI>'s tower.
Here<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">A. D. 44.</NOTE> he celebrated shows in honour of <HI>Cesar,</HI>
a Festival having been appointed to be observed
there at this time for his safety. On this occasion
there was a vast resort of persons of rank and di∣stinction
from all parts of the country. On the
second day of the showes early in the morning he
came into the theatre, dressed in a robe of Silver,
of most curious workmanship. The rayes of the ri∣sing
sun, reflected from so splendid a garb, gave him
a majestic and awful appearance. In a short time they
began in several parts of the theatre flattering ac∣clamations,
which proved pernicious to him. They
called him <HI>a God,</HI> and entreated him <HI>to be propitious
to them,</HI> saying, <HI>Hitherto we have respected you as a
man; but now we acknowledge you to be more than
mortal.</HI> The King neither reproved these persons,
nor rejected the impious flattery. Soon after this,
casting his eyes upward he saw an owle siting upon
a certain cord over his head. He perceived it to
be a messenger of evil to him, as it had been be∣fore
of his prosperity; and was struck with the
deepest concern. Immediately after this, he was
seized with pains in his bowels extremely violent at
the very first. Then turning himself toward his
friends, he spoke to them in this manner: <HI>I, your
God, am required to leave this world; Fate instant∣ly
confuting these false applauses just bestowed upon
me: I, who have been called immortal, am hurried
away to death. But God's appointment must be sub∣mitted
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>
to. Nor has our condition in this world been
despicable; we have lived in the state which is ac∣counted
happy.</HI> While he was speaking these words,
he was oppressed with the increase of his pains. He
was carried therefore with all hast to his palace.
These pains in his bowels continually tormenting
him, he expired in five days time, in the fifty
fourth year of his age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. lib. 19. c. 8. §. 2.</NOTE>, and of his reign the
seventh<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note;</HI> The seventh year of his reign is computed from the time of his first advancement, by <HI>Caligula,</HI> to the Tetrarchie of his uncle <HI>Philip;</HI> A. D. 37.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is needless to make many reflexions here. The
reader's thoughts cannot but carry him to many
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>
points of agreement in these two relations. They
agree, that this event happened at <HI>Cesarea: St. Luke</HI>
says, it was upon <HI>a set day; Josephus,</HI> that it was up∣on
the <HI>second day of the shows</HI> celebrated in honour of
the Emperour. The magnificence of <HI>Herod</HI>'s dresse is
hinted by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and particularly described by <HI>Jo∣sepus.</HI>
The flattery is exactly the same in both. But
in two things, above all others, is the harmony of
these accounts observable. <HI>First,</HI> the temper of mind
with which <HI>Herod</HI> received this flattery. St. <HI>Luke</HI> says,
<HI>he gave not God the glory;</HI> Josephus, <HI>he neither re∣proved
these persons, nor rejected the impious flattery:</HI>
words that deserve particular notice in <HI>Josephus,</HI> be∣cause he has at times represented this <HI>Herod Agrip∣pa</HI>
as an extraordinary person, and free from the
vices of his grandfather <HI>Herod;</HI> and indeed has en∣deavoured
to raise his character for lenity and good∣nesse beyond
what is consistent with some other ac∣counts.
For <HI>Dio Cassius</HI> says, <HI>Agrippa</HI> was reckoned
one of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s advisers in his cruel and tyrannical
measures<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. 59. p. 658.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, in which this harmony is very
considerable, is, that according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> imme∣diately
the angel of the Lord smote him: And <HI>Jose∣pus</HI>
assures us, that these pains seized him in the thea∣tre,
before all the assembly, and that he apprehend∣ed
a fatal necessity of speedily leaving this world.
And when <HI>Josephus</HI> says, <HI>these flattering acclamations
proved pernicious to</HI> Agrippa, he plainly intimates that
his death was supposed to be a punishment for the
approbation with which he received them.</P>
<P>THOUGH St. <HI>Luke</HI> only had related this event,
and there had been no account of it extant in <HI>Jose∣phus,</HI>
or any other ancient writer, yet I should not
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>
have doubted the truth of it. St. <HI>Luke</HI> would not
otherwise have dared to relate an affair so disadvan∣tageous,
as this is in many respects, to so considerable
a person as <HI>Herod;</HI> who was very acceptable to the
<HI>Jewish</HI> people, and had received many honours and
civilities from two successive Roman Emperours, <HI>Ca∣ligula</HI>
and <HI>Claudius.</HI> Nor would any Man of tolera∣ble
capacity, much less so sensible a person as St. <HI>Luke</HI>
appears to be by his writings, have exposed his credit
by placing such an event in so public and noted a
place as <HI>Cesarea,</HI> the person concerned being seated
on a throne, surrounded by attendance suitable to the
occasion of a particular solemnity, if he had not
been sure of the fact. And yet it may be said to
receive a farther confirmation from <HI>Josephus,</HI> who,
we may be assured, out of regard to his own credit,
and his favourable inclination to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> would never
invent such a story as this.</P>
<P>AS for the owle which <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of, and
which is now said to be a <HI>Messenger of evil</HI> to <HI>Agrip∣pa,</HI>
as <HI>it had been before of his prosperity;</HI> it has refe∣rence
to an account he has given of the perching of
such a bird upon a tree near this same <HI>Agrippa,</HI> when
he was put into chains by order of <HI>Tiberius;</HI> and to
a prognostication, which a <HI>German</HI> Astrologer is said
to have delivered at that time concerning him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Jos. Antiq. l. 18. cap. vii. §. 7.</NOTE>.
Whether such a bird did now appear in the theatre
or not, I will not determine; nor do I think it ma∣terial.
<HI>Josephus</HI> does now and then throw a circum∣stance
or two into his relations that give them an
Heathenish aire; with a design, it is probable, of
rendering his history more agreeable to the <HI>Greeks</HI>
and <HI>Romans,</HI> for whom it was principally intended.
But it is evident from his account, that <HI>Herod</HI> was
seized with a very uncommon disorder, and that he
had the most lively apprehensions of his approach∣ing death.
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>
ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>Herod was eaten of worms.</HI> This is
not mentioned by <HI>Josephus.</HI> And this has been sup∣posed
by some to be a considerable objection against
St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account. But in my opinion without any
good reason. For the distemper, of which <HI>Herod
Agrippa</HI> died, was, according to <HI>Josephus</HI>'s own de∣scription
of it, very like to that of <HI>Herod</HI> his Grand∣father;
who, beside other disorders, was aflicted
with violent pains in his bowels, and an ulcer which
bred worms<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. xvii. cap. vi. §. 5.</NOTE>. And it is not at all unlikely that
<HI>Agrippa</HI>'s case was, in this last respect also, very
much the same with that of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. I should
think, that most persons must be ashamed to repre∣sent
the omission of this particular in <HI>Josephus,</HI> as an
objection of any moment. The distempers of great
men are seldom particularly described. A certain
delicacie often restrains men from making mention of
such matters, and especially are historians shy of re∣lating
them concerning those princes, in whose ho∣nour
they are interested. Upon the whole, I believe,
this passage of <HI>Josephus</HI> will be allowed to be a very
remarkable attestation of this extraordinary event,
related by St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be of use to put down here from <HI>Josephus</HI>
the names of <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI>'s children. “Thus died
King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> leaving behind him one Son named
<HI>Agrippa,</HI> then seventeen years of age, and three
daughters, <HI>Bernice,</HI> who was married to <HI>Herod</HI> her
father's brother, being Sixteen years of age, <HI>Ma∣riamne,</HI>
and <HI>Drusilla,</HI> who were unmarried. The
former was ten years old, and <HI>Drusilla</HI> Six—<HI>Dru∣silla</HI>
was contracted to <HI>Epiphanes</HI> Son of <HI>Antiochus</HI>
King of <HI>Commagene</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. xix. c. 9. in.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. VII. FROM the xxiii. and two following chap∣ters
of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> we learn that <HI>Felix</HI> was
Governour in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that <HI>Porcius Festus</HI> succeed∣ed
<PB N="25" REF="41"/>
him; the truth of which is particularly attested by
<HI>Josephus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xx. cap. vi, vii. De B. J. lib. 2. c. 12. §. 8. &amp;c. 13, 14.</NOTE>, in divers parts of his history.</P>
<P>§. VIII. CONCERNING <HI>Felix,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> has men∣tioned
divers things beside his being Governour, that
will deserve our consideration. Whilst St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> saies: <HI>and after certain daies,
when</HI> Felix <HI>came with his wife</HI> DRUSILLA, <HI>which was
a Jewesse, he sent for</HI> Paul, <HI>and heard him concerning
the faith in Christ,</HI> Acts xxiv. 24. This <HI>Drusilla</HI> is
the youngest daughter of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> as was shewn
just now. We have this account in <HI>Josephus,</HI> of her
marriage with <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>AGRIPPA</HI> having received this present from
<HI>Cesar,</HI> [viz. <HI>Claudius</HI>] gave his Sister <HI>Drusilla</HI> in
marriage<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">This was done, A. D. 52, or 53.</NOTE> to <HI>Azizus</HI> King of the <HI>Emesenes,</HI> when
he had consented to be circumcised<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. lib. 20. c. 6. §. 1, 2.</NOTE>. For <HI>Epi∣phanes</HI>
the Son of King <HI>Antiochus</HI> had broke the
contract with her by refusing to embrace the <HI>Jewish</HI>
customs, although he had promised her father he
would.—But this marriage of <HI>Drusilla</HI> with <HI>Azizus</HI>
was dissolved, in a short time, after this manner.
When <HI>Felix</HI> was Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> having had
a sight of her, he was mightily taken with her,
and indeed, she was the most beautiful of her Sex.
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>
He therefore sent to her <HI>Simon,</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI>
who was one of his friends, and pretended to Ma∣gic;
by whom he perswaded her to leave her hus∣band
and marry him, promising to make her per∣fectly
happy, if she did not disdain him. It was
far from being a sufficient reason, but to avoid the
envy of her Sister <HI>Bernice,</HI> who was continually do∣ing
her ill offices because of her beauty, she was
induced to transgress the laws of her country, and
marry <HI>Felix.</HI>”</P>
<P>IT has been thought indeed by some, that <HI>Tacitus</HI>
gives a different account of this <HI>Drusilla,</HI> when he
saies that <HI>Felix</HI> had for his wife, <HI>Drusilla,</HI> grandaugh∣ter
of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> and <HI>Antony.</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">—Drusilla Cleopatrae &amp; Antonii nepte in matrimonium accepta: ut ejusdem Antonii, Felix progener, Claudius nepos esset. Hist. lib. v. cap. 9.</NOTE>. But I don't know
that I am obliged to take notice of this; since <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
agrees with St. <HI>Luke, [that she was a</HI> Jewesse.]
And he may be justly supposed to be as well ac∣quainted
with <HI>Drusilla</HI>'s original as <HI>Tacitus.</HI> I shall

three Queens<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Felicem, quem—provinciaeque Judaeae praeposuit, trium reginarum maritum, Suet. Claud, c. 28.</NOTE>, or three women of royal families.
It is certain that <HI>Drusilla</HI> a <HI>Jewesse,</HI> Sister of <HI>Agrippa</HI>
the younger, was one of them. And if <HI>Tacitus</HI> was
not mistaken, another of them was descended from

called <HI>Drusilla.</HI><NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">She is supposed by some learned men to be the daughter of <HI>Juba,</HI> King of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> by <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> daughter of <HI>M.

<PB N="27" REF="43"/>
has recorded one instance of abominable villainy he
was guilty of. “<HI>Jonathan</HI> the High Priest often ad∣monished
<HI>Felix</HI> to correct his administration; for
that otherwise he himself was in danger of the ill
will of the people, since he had desired the Empe∣rour
to make him Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI>”. But he
not being able to bear these frequent remonstrances,
“by a large sum of money corrupted an intimate
friend of <HI>Jonathan's,</HI> who got him to be assassi∣nated
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 20. c. 7. §. 5.</NOTE>. His government was so irregular, that
the <HI>Jews</HI> followed him with complaints to <HI>Rome,</HI> after
he had left the province: And it was owing to a very
powerful interest made for him at Court, that he esca∣ped
the resentment of <HI>Nero.</HI></P>
<P>ALL these abovementioned particulars from <HI>Jose∣phus,</HI>
and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> may satisfy us, that when <HI>Paul</HI>
[Acts xxiv. 25.] <HI>reasoned of righteousnesse, temperance</HI>
[or chastitie] <HI>and judgment to come,</HI> his Subjects were
well chosen with respect to both his hearers; and
that what St. <HI>Luke</HI> adds [ver. 26.] concerning <HI>Felix,</HI>
that he <HI>hoped that money should have been given him of</HI>
Paul<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Scelus est accipere ab reo: quanto magis ab accusatore? quan∣to etiam sceleratius ab utroque? Cicer. in Verr. lib. ii. n. 78.</NOTE> <HI>that he might loose him,</HI> is no calumnie.</P>
<P>SOME may think it strange, that <HI>Felix</HI> should have
had any hopes of receiving <HI>money</HI> from this prisoner,
when it does not appear he had any estate, and he has
intimated, that he was at times obliged to <HI>labour work∣ing
with his hands</HI> [1 Cor. iv. 12. Acts xx. 34.] for
a subsistence. But in answer to this, it has been ob∣served
by expositors, that <HI>Paul</HI> had told <HI>Felix,</HI> that
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>
<HI>after many years</HI> he <HI>came to bring alms to his nation and
offerings,</HI> Acts xxiv. 17. It is likely therefore that <HI>Fe∣lix</HI>
imagined, that money had not been all distributed
as yet, since <HI>Paul</HI> was apprehended within a few daies
after his coming to <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> [Ch. xxi. 27, xxiv. 11.]
or at lest concluded he must needs be a person of some
consequence, and have good friends.</P>
<P>§. IX. ST. <HI>Luke</HI> saies, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. 13. <HI>And after cer∣tain
day, king</HI> AGRIPPA <HI>and</HI> Bernice <HI>came to</HI> Cesarea
<HI>to salute</HI> Festus. This <HI>Agrippa</HI> is the Son of <HI>Herod
Agrippa</HI> abovementioned. St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls him <HI>king,</HI> as
<HI>Josephus</HI> also does very often<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ant. xx. l. viii. §. 6. &amp; passim.</NOTE>. But St. <HI>Luke</HI> does
not suppose him to be king of <HI>Judea:</HI> For all the ju∣dicial
proceedings in that country, relating to <HI>Paul,</HI>
are transacted before <HI>Felix</HI> and this <HI>Festus</HI> his Succes∣sor.
Besides, he saies here, that <HI>Agrippa came to</HI> Ce∣sarea
<HI>to salute Festus;</HI> that is, to pay his respects to
him, and compliment him upon his arrival in the
province, <HI>See</HI> Acts xxv. 1.</P>
<P>WHEN his father was dead, <HI>Claudius</HI> intended at
first to have put him immediately in possession of his
father's dominions: But <HI>Agrippa</HI> being then but se∣venteen
years of age, the Emperour was perswaded to
alter his mind, “and appointed <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI> prefect
of <HI>Judea,</HI> and the whole kingdome.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ant. xix. c. ix. fin.</NOTE>.” Which
<HI>Fadus</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Tiberius Alexander, Cumanus,
Felix, Festus</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ant. xx. de Bell. lib. ii.</NOTE> though these did not possess the pro∣vince
in the same extent that <HI>Fadus</HI> did.</P>
<P><HI>AGRIPPA</HI> therefore was disappointed of his
father's Kingdome; but he had by this time got con∣siderable territories.</P>
<P>“<HI>HEROD,</HI> brother of king <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Great,
died in the eighth year of the reign of <HI>Claudius
Cesar.</HI>—<HI>Claudius</HI> then gave his government to
<HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. xx. p. 887. in.</NOTE>.” This is our <HI>Agrippa</HI>
we are now speaking of.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="45"/>
“THE twelfth year of his reign being compleat∣ed,
He [<HI>Claudius</HI>] gave <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Tetrarchie of
<HI>Philip,</HI> and <HI>Batanea,</HI> adding also <HI>Trachonitis</HI> with
<HI>Abila;</HI> This had been the Tetrarchie of <HI>Lysanias.</HI>
But he took away from him <HI>Chalcis</HI> after he had
governed it four years<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 890. v. 25, &amp;c.</NOTE>.” This from his <HI>Anti∣quities.</HI>
In the <HI>War of the Jews, Josephus</HI> expresseth
it thus: “After this, He sent <HI>Felix</HI> the brother of
<HI>Pallas</HI> to be Procurator of <HI>Judea, Galilee, Sama∣ria,</HI>
and <HI>Peraea;</HI> and promoted <HI>Agrippa</HI> from
<HI>Chalcis</HI> to a greater kingdome, giving to him the
Tetrarchie which had been <HI>Philip</HI>'s. (This is <HI>Ba∣tanea</HI>
and <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> and <HI>Gaulanitis</HI>). And he
added moreover the kingdome of <HI>Lysanias,</HI> and the
province that had been <HI>Varus</HI>'s<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De B. lib. ii. c. xii. fin.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“<HI>NERO</HI> in the first year of his reign, gave
<HI>Agrippa</HI> a certain part of <HI>Galilee,</HI> ordering <HI>Tiberias</HI>
and <HI>Taricheas</HI> to be subject to him. He gave him
also <HI>Julias</HI> a City of <HI>Peraea,</HI> and fourteen towns
in the neighbourhood of it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ant. xx. c. vii. §. 4.</NOTE>.” St. <HI>Luke</HI> there∣fore
is in the right in giving <HI>Agrippa</HI> the title of <HI>King</HI>
at this time.</P>
<P>THE reader has doubtlesse observed, that when
<HI>Paul</HI> was before <HI>Agrippa,</HI> he addressed himself to him
as a <HI>Jew,</HI> [Acts xxvi. 2, 3.] <HI>I think myself happy King</HI>
Agrippa, <HI>because I shall answer for my self this day be∣fore
thee.</HI>—<HI>Especially because I know thee to be expert in
all customs and questions which are among the</HI> Jews.
[ver. 27.] <HI>King</HI> Agrippa, <HI>believest thou the prophets?
I know that thou believest.</HI></P>
<P>FROM what hath been alledged relating to <HI>Herod
Agrippa,</HI> it is plain he was a zealous <HI>Jew,</HI> or at lest
appeared so at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and had educated all his
children in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion. This <HI>Agrippa,</HI> his
Son, undoubtedly maintained the same profession; and
now he had, by the permission of the Emperour, the
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>
direction of the sacred treasury, the government of
the temple, and the right of nominating the High
Priests<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jesephus</HI> indeed says, Antiq. l. xx. c. 1. §. 3. That <HI>Herod</HI> King of <HI>Chaleis,</HI> brother of <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Great] did upon the death of his brother request of <HI>Claudius Cesar</HI> the power of the Temple, and of the sacred Money, and the right of nominating the High Priest; and that he obtained all these privileges: And that from him this power continued to all his descendants till the end of the War. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But either there is some errour here in the copies of <HI>Josephus,</HI> or else we do not understand him aright. For none of the Sons of <HI>Herod</HI> of <HI>Chalcis</HI> did nominate any High Priests. But according to <HI>Josephus</HI>'s own account, all the changes in the Priest∣hood after the death of the said <HI>Herod</HI> [which happened in the 8th of <HI>Claudius</HI>] to the time of the War, were made by <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger, Nephew of this <HI>Herod</HI> King of <HI>Chalcis.</HI> See Ant. xx. c. vii. §. 11. c. viii. §. 1. And when the people of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had a mind to apply the sacred money to any particular purpose, they addressed to <HI>Agrippa:</HI> and he gave the directions, ibid. §. 7.

<P>§. X. <HI>BERNICE</HI> was a Lady well known in
those times. There are several reflexions made upon
her conduct by <HI>Josephus</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. xx. cap. vi. §. 3.</NOTE>, as well as other wri∣ters<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Hist. l. ii. c. 2. &amp; 81. Juv. Sat. 6. v. 155.</NOTE>. But as St. <HI>Luke</HI> saies nothing of her, be∣side

respect, which <HI>Titus Vespasian</HI> shewed her, gave occa∣sion
for much discourse; and that she had once hopes

<P>§. XI. THERE are but two things more I shall
take notice of in this chapter. They may be judged
by some too minute to be insisted on; but they ap∣pear
to me instances of great exactnesse and propri∣ety,
and to afford a strong proof, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> was
perfectly well acquainted with the matters of which
he wrote.</P>
<P><HI>PAUL</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> having preached the word
of God at <HI>Salamis</HI> [in <HI>Cyprus</HI>] went through <HI>the Isle
to</HI> Paphos, <HI>where they found</HI> Barjesus, <HI>which was with
the</HI> DEPUTY <HI>of the countrey</HI> SERGIUS PAULUS; [Acts
xiii. 7.] But in the <HI>Greek</HI> it is, with the PROCONSUL,
<HI>Sergius Paulus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is well known to the learned, that upon <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>'s
becoming absolute master of the Roman Com∣monwealth,
there was a division made of the pro∣vinces
of the Empire<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Stra∣bon. Geog. lib. 3. p. 166. Ed. Amst. 1707. &amp; lib. xvii. fin. Suet. August. c. 47, 48. Dio lib. 53. p. 503.</NOTE>: The most powerful, or
at lest, those which required the greatest number of
troops, the Emperour kept to himself; the rest were
made over to the People and Senate. The officers
sent by the Emperour were called Lieutenants, or
Propraetors, though they were Consular persons;
that is, though they had served the Consulship in the
City<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: Dio. lib. 53. p. 504. D.</NOTE>. The Governours sent by the Senate, into
<PB N="32" REF="48"/>
the provinces that belonged to their share, he ap∣pointed
to be called Proconsuls, a name more suita∣ble
to the peaceful state which the provinces allotted
to the Senate were in. But the division made at this
time<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">A. U. 727. before Christ, 27. vid. Basnage annal. Polit. Eccl.</NOTE> underwent many changes. And a province,
assigned at first to the Senate, was afterwards made
over to the Emperour, and on the contrarie. Such
a change happened with reference to this province of
<HI>Cyprus;</HI> which, in the first partition, was one of the
Emperour's provinces, but was afterwards together
with <HI>Gallia Narbonensis</HI> given to the Senate; in the
room of which he took <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> which at first was
theirs<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dio. ibid. p. 504. A. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; id. lib. 54. ad A. U. 732. p. 523. B.</NOTE>. In this state this province continued, and
the proper title of the Governour of <HI>Cyprus</HI> was that
of <HI>Proconsul.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, <HI>Strabo</HI> saies, <HI>Cyprus</HI> was a <HI>Praetorian</HI>
Province<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, lib. 14. sub fin.</NOTE>; and this has made this text a mighty
difficultie with many learned men. <HI>Beza</HI> went so far
into the opinion of the improprietie of this expression,
as to attempt to correct it in his translation of this
text; and he put <HI>Propraetor,</HI> in the room of <HI>Pro∣consul.</HI>
And the Solutions, which have been offered
by divers other learned men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Baron. A. Chr. 46. n. xi. Grot. in loc. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, have, I beleive,
appeared unsatisfactorie. But if <HI>Dio</HI>'s whole account
of this matter had been attended to, the difficulty
had vanished<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vid. Noris. Cenotaph. Pisan. p. 219.</NOTE>. <HI>Cyprus</HI> was undoubtedly a <HI>Prae∣torian</HI>
Province, as all the People's provinces were,
except two. But the Governours of all their pro∣vinces
had the title of <HI>Proconsul.</HI> “It was decreed
that two of their provinces, <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="49"/>
should be appropriated to Senators that had been
Consuls, and all the rest were given to those which
had been Praetors<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Dio p. 505. C.</NOTE>”. But that they should be
“all called Proconsuls, not only those which had been
Consuls, but those also which had been only Prae∣tors
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>id. p. 504. C.</NOTE>”. And <HI>Suetonius</HI> saies, “That <HI>Augustus</HI>
took the most powerful provinces to himself, and
gave the rest to Proconsuls chosen by the Se∣nate<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Provincias validiores ipse suscepit—caeteras proconsulibus sortito permisit in August. cap. 47.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES also support this use of the word.
<HI>Crete</HI> was a <HI>Praetorian</HI> province, according to <HI>Strabo</HI>
and <HI>Dio;</HI> yet <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>Caesius Cordus,</HI> Proconsul
of <HI>Crete</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ancharius Priscus Caesium Cordum proconsulem Cretae postulaverat repetundis. Ad. A. U. 774. Ann. l. iii. cap. 38.</NOTE>. There is also an ancient inscription, of
<HI>Caligula</HI>'s reign, in which <HI>Aquius Scaura</HI> is called Pro∣consul
of <HI>Cyprus</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. Aquius Scaura—C. CAESARE PRO CONSULE CYPRUM OBTINUIT. in Gruter. Inscript. pag. 360. 3. laudat. a Noris. Cenotaph. Pisan. Dissert. ii. p. 219.</NOTE>. If I have done St. <HI>Luke</HI> justice
in this place, it is chiefly owing to Assistances bor∣rowed
from Cardinal <HI>Norris:</HI> and I think my self
obliged to make a particular acknowledgment of
it.</P>
<P>§. XII. THE last thing I shall take notice of, is
the title given to <HI>GALLIO</HI><NOTE N="L" PLACE="foot">Of <HI>Gallio</HI> see more Ch. viii. §. 1.</NOTE>; who in our tran∣slation
is called the <HI>Deputie,</HI> but in the <HI>Greek,</HI> Pro∣consul<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>
<HI>of Achaia.</HI> In this instance St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s ac∣curacie
appears more conspicuous than in the former,
because this province had a more various fortune than
the other. In the original partition they were assigned
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>
to the People and Senate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dio. p. 503. fin.</NOTE>. In the reign of <HI>Tiberi∣us</HI>
they were at their own request made over to the
Emperour<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Achaiam ac Macedoniam, onera deprecantes, levari in praesens proconsulari imperio, tradique Cae∣sari placuit. Tacit. An. lib. 1. cap. 76.</NOTE>. In the reign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> when
<HI>L. Quinctius Crispinus</HI> and <HI>M. Statilius Taurus</HI> were
Consuls, A. U. 797. A. D. 44. They were again
restored to the Senate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Provincias A∣chaiam &amp; Macedoniam, quas Tiberius ad curam suam transtulerat, senatui reddidit. Sueton. in Claud. cap. 25. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Dio l. 60. p. 680. E.</NOTE>. And therefore <HI>from that
time</HI> [as <HI>Dio</HI> saies upon <HI>Augustus</HI>'s giving <HI>Cyprus</HI> to the
Senate] <HI>Proconsuls were sent into this countrey.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI>
was brought before <HI>Gallio</HI> in the year of our Lord
52<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Basnage Ann. P. E.</NOTE>, or 53<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Pearson. Ann. Paul.</NOTE>; consequently <HI>Gallio</HI> was Procon∣sul
of <HI>Achaia,</HI> as St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls him.</P>
<P>AND perhaps it will not be amisse to observe, that
afterwards <HI>Nero</HI> made the <HI>Achaians</HI> a free people<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Universae Achaiae libertatem Domitius Nero dedit. Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. iv. cap. 6.</NOTE>.
The Senate therefore lost this province again. How∣ever,
that they might not be sufferers, <HI>Nero</HI> gave
them the Island of <HI>Sardinia</HI> in the room of it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Pausan. p. 428. Hanov. 1613.</NOTE>. <HI>Ve∣spasian</HI>
made <HI>Achaia</HI> a province again<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Achaiam—li∣bertate ademta, in provinciarum formam redegit, Sueton. in Ve∣spas. c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise a peculiar propriety in the
name of the province, of which <HI>Gallio</HI> was Proconsul.
The Country subject to him was all <HI>Greece;</HI> but the
proper name of the province among the <HI>Romans</HI> was

own country, two things are to be re∣garded,
their <HI>religious</HI> and their <HI>civil</HI>
state.</P>
<P>§. I. THAT they had, according to
the sacred writers, the free exercise of their religion,
is evident from the whole tenour of the history con∣tained
in the <HI>Gospels</HI> and the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI> They
had their Synagogues, the Law and the Prophets were
read there, our Saviour taught in the Synagogues.
Whenever he healed any Lepers, He <HI>bid</HI> them <HI>go and
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>
shew</HI> themselves <HI>to the Priests, and offer the gift that</HI>
Moses <HI>commanded,</HI> Matth. viii. 4. Luke v. 14.</P>
<P>THERE appears to have been a great resort to the
Temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> from <HI>Galilee,</HI> and other parts,
at all their usual great Feasts. They were at full li∣bertie
to make what contributions they saw sit to
their sacred Treasury; [Mark xii. 41, 44. Luke xxi.
v. 1.] And so secure were they, that they used indirect
practises to enrich it. [<HI>Matth.</HI> xv. 5. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 11, 12.]
There is no mention made in the history of our Savi∣viour's
ministry, of any restraint, or obstruction they
met with in their worship, save that one of the <HI>Gali∣leans,
whose bloud</HI> Pilate <HI>had mingled with their Sacri∣fices,</HI>
Luke xiii. 1.</P>
<P>§. II. THAT they might thus freely perform all
the Services of their religion, tho' they be supposed to
have been then under the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, is not
at all improbable. For the <HI>Romans</HI> had ever permit∣ted
the people they conquered to practise their own
religious rites in their own way: and seem not to have
departed from this principle, till after the period of
the Evangelical History. And that the <HI>Jews</HI> were now
at full liberty to worship God, according to the insti∣tutions
of <HI>Moses,</HI> we are assured by <HI>Josephus,</HI> who has
left us the history of these times. The <HI>Roman</HI> Presi∣dents
did indeed, for some time, put in, and turn out
their High Priests at Pleasure. <HI>Valerius Gratus, Pi∣late</HI>'s
Predecessor, made several High Priests, in the
time of his government<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 18. c. ii.</NOTE>. The last High Priest he
made was <HI>Caiaphas;</HI> who continued in that office du∣ring
all <HI>Pilate</HI>'s administration. He being removed
from the Province, <HI>Vitellius,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> put
in <HI>Jonathan</HI> the Son of <HI>Ananus</HI> or <HI>Annas</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. v. §. 3.</NOTE>; and af∣terward
<HI>Theophilus,</HI> another Son of <HI>Ananus,</HI> in the
room of <HI>Jonathan</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cap. vi. § 3.</NOTE>. But in this there was nothing
unusual or extraordinarie. <HI>Herod</HI> the Great and <HI>Ar∣chelaus</HI>
had been wont, before this, to constitute and
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>
remove the High Priests at pleasure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ant 1. xx. cap. ix. fin.</NOTE>. <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
just now mentioned, continued High Priest till <HI>Herod
Agrippa,</HI> [mentioned in the xii. <HI>Acts</HI>] then king of all
<HI>Judea</HI> displaced him, and put <HI>Simon</HI> the Son of <HI>Boethus</HI>
into his room<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. xix. c. 6, §. 2.</NOTE>. However this <HI>Herod</HI> was a <HI>Jew;</HI>
and from thence to the time the war broke out with
the <HI>Romans,</HI> the nomination of the High Priests, and
the Government of the Temple, were committed to
Princes of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, by the direction of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Emperours. After the death of <HI>Herod Agrip∣pa,
Claudius</HI> inverted <HI>Herod</HI> King of <HI>Chalcis,</HI> brother
of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> with these powers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Antiq. xx. cap. 1. §. 3.</NOTE>. And after
his death, <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger, son of the said <HI>Herod
Agrippa</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 899. 1. 10.</NOTE>. And though they might all act some∣what
arbitrarily in the nomination of the High Priests,
yet they always confined their choice to those who were
of the race of the Priests.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Governours did indeed sometimes of∣fer
them abuses, or suffer abuses to be committed in
the country contrarie to the institutions of the Law, as
they did also injure them in their civil properties. But
these abuses seem not to have been very numerous;
when any were committed, it was without the Empe∣rour's
authority; and usually the <HI>Jews</HI> at length ob∣tained
satisfaction<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. Antiq. xx. c. iv. §. 3, 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS general view of the Religious State of the
<HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> may suffice at present. I shall have oc∣casion
to enlarge more upon this Subject hereafter.</P>
<P>§. III. THEIR <HI>civil</HI> state will require a more parti∣cular
consideration in this place. It will be needful to
lay together a good number of texts, that the reader
may be able to judge what representation the sacred
historians have given of this matter. That it may be
done distinctly, I desire leave to divide their history in∣to
four periods. These will serve to relieve us in a dis∣quisition,
which will be of some length. And perhaps
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
we may have some other advantages, and receive some
clearer light into this matter, by this method, than
we should have otherwise.</P>
<P>1. THE first period reaches from the preaching of
<HI>John Baptist</HI> to our Saviour's Resurrection.</P>
<P>II. THE second, from thence to the time of <HI>Herod</HI>
the King, mentioned <HI>Acts</HI> xii.</P>
<P>III. THE reign of this <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>IV. FROM the end of his reign to the conclusion
of the Evangelical History.</P>
<P>§. IV. I must here premise, that in going over the
several passages of scripture relating to this matter,
we are particularly to have our eye to a point in which
learned men are not entirely agreed, namely, what
power and authority the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation was now pos∣sed
of; and whether they had the power of life and
death; or only a right to inflict some lesser penalties.</P>
<P>2. I would likewise observe, that our enquirie here
will chiefly be confined to the State of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
properly so called. I have already shewn (in
part at left) in the foregoing chapter, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
has given a just account of the several divisions of the
land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and of the Princes and Governours, to
whom they belonged: But now we are to consider the
power, which the <HI>Jews</HI> were possessed of in <HI>Judea.</HI>
Therefore the beheading of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> is a fact,
that does not at present come particularly under our
Consideration. He was beheaded by <HI>Herod Tetrarch</HI>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> Son of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. And there can be
no doubt, but he had the power of life and death (how∣ever
he abused it) in his own territories.</P>
<P>3. I would also premise, that the Evangelists are
not answerable for the legality of all the facts they
have related. It's said that, <HI>all they in the Synagogue
when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
and rose up and thrust him</HI> [Jesus] <HI>out of the city</HI>
[Nazareth] <HI>and led him unto the browe of the hill
whereon their City was built, that they might cast him
down headlong,</HI> Luke iv. 28, 29.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="55"/>
THE <HI>Jews</HI> are said to have taken up stones to cast
at <HI>Jesus,</HI> more than once, [<HI>John</HI> viii. 59. x. 31, 33,
39.] and that in the Temple. It is also said, that
when <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>about to sail into</HI> Syria, from Greece,
<HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>laid wait for him,</HI> Acts xx. 3. So that he
was forced to alter his purpose, and go another way.
It can never be supposed that any of these attempts
were legal. It cannot be thought, that <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Te∣trarch,</HI>
in whose territories <HI>Nazareth</HI> was, permitted
the multitude to throw men off the precipice, when∣ever
they did not like their Doctrine. Much less can
it be supposed, that such practises were allowed in any
places where the Government was in the hands of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> as it certainly was in <HI>Greece,</HI> if not also in
<HI>Judea.</HI> Such practises as these are never countenanced
by those who are in authority. And if the <HI>Scribes</HI> and
<HI>Pharisees,</HI> and the great men among the <HI>Jews</HI> had, at
this time, any principles that justified and encouraged
fifth actions; and if they excited the common people
to them in <HI>Judea,</HI> as well as in other parts; it may be
reckoned an argument they had not the government
in their own hands, or the power of putting men to
death by their own authority, when they judged them
guilty. This observation may be of some use here∣after.</P>
<P>§. V. I shall now proceed to consider the account
we meet with in the Evangelists in the <HI>first Period,</HI> from
the commencement of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist's</HI> ministry to
the Resurrection of our Saviour.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has informed us, that when the word of
God came to <HI>John,</HI> in the fifteenth <HI>year of</HI> Tiberius,
Pontius Pilate <HI>was governour of</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Annas <HI>and</HI>
Caiaphas <HI>were High Priests,</HI> Luke iii. 1, 2. And all
the Evangelists have assured us, that our Saviour was
brought before <HI>Pilate</HI> and condemned by him. So
that [according to them] <HI>Pilate</HI> was Governour in
<HI>Judea,</HI> during the whole time of our Saviour's mini∣strie,
or the period we are now in. But because the
power of this Governour is not particularly described by
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>
any of the Evangelists, in order to judge what autho∣rity
he had here, and what power <HI>Annas</HI> or <HI>Caiaphas,</HI>
or any other chief men among the <HI>Jews</HI> were possessed
of in this country, we must observe the discourses,
proceedings, and events recorded by the sacred histo∣rians,
which have any relation to this matter.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Jews</HI> appear to have been at liberty to
follow their own laws and customs in mod matters,
particularly in the affair of marrirge and divorce, in
which they dissered considerably from many other
people.</P>
<P><HI>IT has been said, whosoever shall put away his wife,
let him give her a writing of divorcement: but I say unto
you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for
the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery:
and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, commit∣teth
adultery,</HI> Matth. v. 31, 32. It is evident, from
the manner, in which our Lord condemns all divorces,
save those made for the <HI>cause of fornication,</HI> that they
did at this time put them in practise upon other ac∣counts.
This appears also from the questions put to
him [<HI>Matth.</HI> xix. 3, 10. <HI>Mark</HI> x. 2, 9.] concerning
this matter, and the answers he gave to them, and the
surprize and uneasiness which the disciples express at his
decisions, when he forbad such licentious divorces as
those made <HI>for every cause; for they said unto him, if
the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to
marry.</HI></P>
<P>IT is said indeed, that when the <HI>Pharisees</HI> brought
these questions, <HI>they came to him tempting him.</HI> But
there seems not to have been any danger of giving of∣fense
to the Roman Government, in this case, which
way so ever the question was answered. The design
could be only to expose him to the resentment of the
<HI>Jewish</HI> people, by decisions contrary to practises they
indulged tnemselves in, and were very fond of; as I
think appears likewise from the notice, the disciples
took of what he said upon this subject.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="57"/>
HOWEVER this is no proof of any great degree of
power in the nation, at this time. <HI>Josephus</HI> saies he
put away his second wife, because “he did not like
her manners”<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in vit. p. 945. 44.</NOTE>. This was after the destruction
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and he was settled at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JUSTIN Martyr,</HI> about the midle of the se∣cond
Centurie, says, “That to that very day, their
<HI>Rabbies</HI> permitted them to have, each man, four,
or five wives<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dialog. Par. ii. P. 363. D.</NOTE>”. And “that, where-ever they
were, they conversed with as many women as they
pleased, and that, under the notion of marriage<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. p. 371. A.</NOTE>”.
Their <HI>Rabbies</HI> indulged them in these practises, and it
seems, the <HI>Romans</HI> did not interrupt them.</P>
<P>2. <HI>OUR Lord says,</HI> [Matth. <HI>v.</HI> 21, 22.] Ye have
heard, that it was said by them of old time, <HI>[or, to the
ancients,]</HI> thou shalt not kill: and whosoever shall kill,
shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you,
that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause,
shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall
say to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of the
counsel.</P>
<P><HI>GROTIUS</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 21.</NOTE> supposes, that tho' the power of
inflicting capital punishments had been now for some
time taken away from the <HI>Jews;</HI> yet our Saviour al∣ludes
to those methods of proceeding, which had been
in use among them, and were still fresh in their me∣mory.
Our Lord, I think, does not declare at all,
what power they now had, or made use of; but from
the mention of the words of their Law, and referring
perhaps to the sense in which they then understood it;
that they who committed murder deserved punishment,
and that they who forbore that, were innocent, pro∣ceeds
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
to lay down a more strict and pure morality. What
he delivers, in terms accommodated to their courts of
judicature, is certainly no representation of their con∣duct,
or the state of things, at that time. For it cannot
be thought, that every one who was angry with his
brother without a cause, was then in danger of the judg∣ment,
[unless the word mean the judgment of God] or
that every one who said to his brother <HI>Racha,</HI> was in
danger of being brought by them before the Councel.</P>
<P>3. <HI>OUR Lord delivered many predictions concern∣ing
the treatment, which his followers would meet
with.</HI> Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send
than prophets and apostles; and some of them they shall
slay and persecute, <HI>Luke xi.</HI> 49. Wherefore behold I send
unto you prophets and wise men and Scribes; and some of
them shall ye kill and crucifie, and some of them shall ye
scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute them from Citie
to Citie, <HI>Matth. xx.</HI> 34. Take heed to your selves, for
they shall deliver you up to the councels: and in the Syna∣gogues
ye shall be beaten, and ye shall be brought before
Rulers and Kings for my sake, <HI>Mark xiii.</HI> 9. See <HI>John
xvi.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>THESE words of our Lord would, I think, be un∣derstood
by his hearers, agreeably to the state of
things at that time, whatever it was: those punish∣ments
which are purely <HI>Jewish,</HI> such as being scourg∣ed
in their Synagogues, or driven from them, would
be understood to be inflicted by <HI>Jewish</HI> hands. If the
<HI>Jews</HI> had not then the power of condemning men to
death, the capital punishments spoken of, as to be in∣slicted
by them, would be understood to be brought
about by their means and procurement; unless it were
thought, that the words implied a prediction, that
they would have, supreme power, though they now
had it not; and that then they would use it for these
purposes.</P>
<P>IT can never be inferred from hence, that they had
at this time supreme power in <HI>Judea,</HI> or any where
else. It is very common to ascribe to men, not only
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>
those things they do themselves, but those also which
are brought about by their means. In all languages,
and in all countries, the punishment of an offender is
ascribed to the prosecutor, the judge, and the execu∣tioner,
tho' this last only put him to death in the
strictest sense. Thus, it is certain that <HI>Pilate</HI> condem∣ned
our Lord, and his officers crucified him: Yet the
<HI>Jews</HI> are more than once said to have crucified Christ,
because his death was owing to their prosecution, and
importunity. <HI>Cleophas</HI> one of the disciples whom Jesus
met in the way to <HI>Emaus</HI> told him, <HI>how the chief
priests, and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to
death and have</HI> CRUCIFIED <HI>him,</HI> Luke xxiv. 20. The
<HI>crucifying,</HI> as well as <HI>delivering up</HI> Jesus, is ascribed to
the chief priests. <HI>Peter</HI> speaks to his hearers in this
manner: <HI>Ye men of</HI> Israel, <HI>hear these words; Jesus of</HI>
Nazareth, <HI>a man approved of God among you</HI>—<HI>Him ye
have taken, and by wicked hands have</HI> CRUCIFIED AND
SLAIN, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 22, 23. Again, <HI>Peter, filled with the
Holy Ghost, said unto them YE rulers of the people and
elders of</HI> Israel.<SEG REND="decorInit">—</SEG><HI>Be it known unto you all, and to the
people of</HI> Israel, <HI>that by the name of Jesus of</HI> Nazareth,
<HI>whom YE crucified, does this man stand here before you
whole,</HI> Ch. vi. 8, 10.</P>
<P>So <HI>Josephus</HI> says, That <HI>Herod</HI> reigned thirty four
years after he had killed <HI>Antigonus</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseh. de Bell. lib. i. cap. 33, §. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. p. 770. v. 37.</NOTE>. Though every
one knows, it was <HI>Mark Antony</HI> who beheaded <HI>Anti∣gonus,</HI>
at the request of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>AND not only is this stile used in relating facts that
have already happened, but also in predicting those
that are future. <HI>Then said Jesus unto them: When</HI> YE
HAVE LIFT UP <HI>the Son of man,</HI> &amp;c. [John viii. 28.]
Though at other times, when he speaks of his death,
he represents the share they would have in it, more di∣stinctly.
<HI>Saying, Behold we go up to</HI> Jerusalem: <HI>and
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests.—.
and they shall condemn</HI> HIM TO DEATH AND SHALL DE∣LIVER
HIM TO THE GENTILES, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33.</P>
<P>IN like manner, he thus represents the sufferings his
followers would be exposed to. <HI>Now the brother shall
betray the brother to death, and the father the son: and
the children shall rise up against their parents, and shall
cause them to be put to death, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,] and
shall put them to death,</HI> Mark xiii. 12. It never was <HI>le∣gal,</HI>
according to any constitution in the world, for
children in a private capacitie to put their parents to
death. And this phrase is to be explained by those that
go before, of <HI>betraying</HI> or <HI>delivering,</HI> that is, accusing,
and prosecuting them, that they may be put to death.</P>
<P>IN all these places then our Lord would be under∣stood
by his hearers, according to the quality of the
persons spoken of, and the state of affairs at that
time, whatever it was.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> persecuting from city to city <HI>is no argument of
supreme power any where.</HI> The <HI>Jews, [at</HI> Antioch <HI>in</HI>
Pisidia] stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
the chief men of the city, and raised perfection against
<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and expelled them out of their coasts,
<HI>Acts xiii. 50. Again, the same thing happened at</HI>
Iconium. But the multitude of the City was divided, and
part held with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and part with the apostles. And
when there was an assault made both of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
and also of the <HI>Jews</HI>—they were ware of it, and fled unto
<HI>Lystra</HI> and <HI>Derbe,</HI> Acts <HI>xiv.</HI> 4, 6. And in many ci∣ties,
situated undoubtedly in countries subject to the
Roman jurisdiction, but in which the <HI>Jews</HI> had settle∣ments,
did they foment disturbances againsi the Apo∣stles,
and thus drive them from place to place.</P>
<P>FARTHER, our Lord bid his disciples to <HI>beware of
men: for they will deliver you up to the councels, and they
will scourge you in their Synagogues,</HI> Matth. x. 17. xxiii.
34. It must be supposed, since the <HI>Jews</HI> had the free
exercise of their religion, and we often read of the Ru∣ler
of the Synagogue, that the expelling from the Sy∣nagogue,
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
and beating in the Synagogues were punish∣ments
purely <HI>Jewish,</HI> and that they inflicted these pe∣nalties
by their own proper authority. The <HI>Jews</HI> a∣greed,
in our Saviour's life time, that <HI>if any man did
confess that he was the Christ, he should be put out of the
Synagogue,</HI> John ix. 22. This was a decree of theirs;
and they did actually <HI>cast out,</HI> or excommunicate the
man, that had been cured of his blindness, <HI>ver.</HI> 34.
St. <HI>Paul</HI> saies, that before his conversion, <HI>He beat in
every Synagogue them that believed in Jesus,</HI> Acts xxiii.
19. Nay, as they had settlements in many parts, and
were protected by the laws in the exercise of their re∣ligion,
it's not unlikely that they inflicted this punsh∣ment
also out of <HI>Judea.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> saies, <HI>Of the? Jews
received I five times forty stripes save one,</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 24.
He usually made so short a stay when he came into
<HI>Judea,</HI> the several times he was there after his conver∣sion,
that its most likely these scourgings had happen∣ed,
most or all of them in some other countrie. <HI>Epi∣phanius,</HI>
who lived in the fourth Centurie, informs us,
that one <HI>Joseph,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> whom he knew, having re∣ceived
a Book of the Gospels from a Christian Bishop,
and being surprized by some of his countrymen, when
he was reading it, they took the book out of his hands
with great violence, threw him on the ground, “drag'd
him to the Synagogue and there beat him.”<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Epiph. 1. i. Tom. ii. c. xi. Haeres. 30. Vid. etiam Grot, ad Matth, x. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>URIEL <HI>Acosta</HI> suffered this punishment in the
Synagogue at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> in the last century, of which
he has himself published a curious relation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid. Limborch. Amic, Collat. p. 349, 350.</NOTE>. This
therefore must be reckoned one of those lesser penal∣ties,
which they had a right to inflict in <HI>Judea,</HI> and
possibly out of it.</P>
<P>4. THE Question brought to our Saviour about
Tribute [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxii. 15, 20.] is remarkable. <HI>Then
went the</HI> Pharisees, <HI>and took Counsel how they might en∣tangle
him in his talk; and they sent out their disciples—Saying,
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
We know that thou teachest the way of God in
truth—Is it lawful to give tribute to</HI> Cesar <HI>or not? But
Jesus perceived their wickedness,</HI> [Craftiness, <HI>Luke</HI> xx.
23.] <HI>and said, why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites; shew me
the tribute money. And they brought him a peny: and he
saith unto them, whose is this image and superscription? And
they say unto him,</HI> Cesar's. This is a proof the Empe∣rour's
coin was current among them, and that they
paid tribute to him. St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s introduction to this
story is in these words: <HI>And they watched him, and sent
forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that
they might take hold of his words, that so they might deli∣ver
him unto the power and authority of the Governour,</HI>
Luke xx. 20.</P>
<P>5. <HI>IN the viii chapter of St.</HI> John <HI>we have another
ensnaring question put to our Saviour.</HI> The <HI>Scribes</HI>
and <HI>Pharisees</HI> brought unto him a woman taken in adulterie:
and when they set her in the midst, they say unto him, Ma∣ster,
this Woman was taken in adulterie, in the very act:
Now <HI>Moses</HI> in the Law commanded us, that such should
be stoned; but what sayest thou<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It is well known, there are very strong objections brought by learned men against the genuinenesse of this paragraph of St. John's Gospel concerning the woman taken in Adulterie, Vid. Milii N. T. Edit. Kusteri &amp; S. Basnage. Annal. Polit. Eccl. A. D. 32. n. 50. But I do not take any advantage of these objections.</NOTE>? <HI>It is evident this
was an ensnaring question, for St.</HI> John <HI>adds,</HI> ver. 6.
This they said tempting him, that they might have to ac∣cuse
him.</P>
<P>THE Speech they made seems to me very artful,
and it is not easy to say which way they desired to have
their question answered. But they seem to have suggest∣ed
the strongest reasons they could, against his deter∣mining,
that they might not stone her. Perhaps there∣fore,
they wished he would say, they ought to obey the
Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> Now, if the <HI>Romans</HI> did not allow them
at that time to inflict this punishment in this case
here would have been matter of accusation before the
Governour, if the question were so resolved by him.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="63"/>
OUR Lord however gives a most surprizing, and
unlooked for decision. <HI>So when they continued asking
him, he lift up himself, and said unto them, He that is
without sin, let him cast the first stone at her,</HI> ver. 7. <HI>And
they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
went out one by one, beginning at the eldeft even unto the
last,</HI> ver. 9. It gives one indeed, a terrible idea of the
wickednesse of that people at that time; but I think,
it is evident from hence, that all, then present, were
guiltie of crimes of a like nature with that they char∣ged
this woman with. And I mould think it may be
concluded, with some probability, from the decision
our Saviour pronounced, that they had not at this time
the power of Honing any one for this crime; because
the design of the answer given them at last by our Sa∣viour
seems to have been, to shew them how unworthy
They were of the power of inflicting capital punish∣ments;
and to intimate, that they ought not to expect
to be restored to the Authority they wished for, whilst
they were so universally<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">There is a remarkable Passage in the Speech of <HI>Josephus</HI> to the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> while <HI>Titus</HI> with the <HI>Roman</HI> army lay before the city. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. de Bell. 1. v. cap. 9. §. 4.</NOTE> corrupt. And how little
they deserved to be entrusted with the administration
of justice, appears from their notorious partiality; See
<HI>Deut.</HI> xxii. <HI>ver.</HI> 23, 24. for if this woman was taken in
the act, as they said, they might have brought the
man also. This our Saviour takes no notice of: they
Were a set of men, whom it was in vain to argue with
in a direct way. The decision he gave is a proof of
the highest wisdome, and had the effect to fill them
for the present with confusion.</P>
<P>6. THEY had their councils; these were summon∣ed,
met, issued out orders. There is also frequent
mention of their forming designs to apprehend Jesus,
and put him to death.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="64"/>
<HI>JESUS having healed a man with a withered hand
on the Sabbath day, the</HI> Pharisees held a councel against
him, how they might destroy him, <HI>Matth. xii. 14. The
man that had been cured by him at the pool of</HI> Beth∣esda,
<HI>having told the</HI> Jews, <HI>that it was</HI> Jesus that had
made him whole, <HI>it is said,</HI> therefore did the <HI>Jews</HI> perse∣cute
Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done
these things on the Sabbath day. But Jesus answered them,
my father worketh hitherto, and I work. Therefore the
Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had
broken the Sabbath, but said also, that God was his fa∣ther,
making himself equal with God. <HI>[John v.</HI> 15, 18.]
After these things, Jesus walked in <HI>Galilee:</HI> for he would
not walk in <HI>Jewry,</HI> because the <HI>Jews</HI> sought to kill him,
[<HI>Ch. vii. I.</HI>]—Then said some of them of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Is
not this he whom they feel to kill? [<HI>ver.</HI> 25.] The <HI>Phari∣sees</HI>
heard that the people murmured such things concerning
him: and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and chief priests sent officers to
take him: [<HI>ver.</HI> 32.] Therefore they sought again to take
him: but he escaped out of their hands, [<HI>Ch. x.</HI> 39.] <HI>Af∣ter
he had raised</HI> Lazarus, <HI>some of them that were by</HI>
went their waies to the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and told them, what
things Jesus had done. Then gathered the chief priests
and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> a councel, and said, what do we?
For this man does many miracles, [<HI>Ch. xi.</HI> 45, 47.]
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for
to put him to death, [<HI>ver.</HI> 53.] But the chief priests con∣sulted,
that they might put Lazarus also to death, [<HI>Ch.
xii.</HI> 10.]</P>
<P>7. BUT the actual apprehending, trial, and prose∣cution
of Jesus, is the most particular, and material
instance of their authority in this period. And, if I
mistake not, the method of proceeding in this affair
does explain the nature of all those designs hitherto
mentioned to put Jesus to death, excepting only
clandestine or tumultuous attempts.</P>
<P>IT will suffice to tranfcribe St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s ac∣count,
taking in, here and there, a circumstance
from the other Evangelists.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="65"/>
THEN assembled together the chief Priests, and the
Scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the Palace of
the High Priest, which was called <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> and con∣sulted
that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
[<HI>Matth. xxvi.</HI> 3, 4.] Then one of the twelve, called <HI>Ju∣das
Iscariot,</HI> went unto the chief priests.—And they cove∣nanted
with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that
time he sought opportunity to betray him. [<HI>v.</HI> 14—16.] When
Jesus was in the garden, whither he had <HI>retired after
supper:</HI> Lo, <HI>Judas,</HI> one of the twelve, came; and with
him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief
priests and elders of the people. [<HI>ver.</HI> 47.] <HI>St.</HI> John <HI>saies
Ch. xviii.</HI> 5. <HI>Judas</HI> then having received a band of men,
and officers from the chief priests and <HI>Pharisees</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>. This
band <HI>must be a company of Soldiers. Our Saviour is
evidently apprehended by the authority of the</HI> Jewish
<HI>councel; but beside the officers of the High Priest,
here are soldiers, taken, it's likely, with the Gover∣nour's
leave, from the Guard constantly kept by the</HI>
Romans at Jerusalem. <HI>This may be inferred from the</HI>
Jews <HI>going to the Governour, after our Saviour's
crucifixion, for a guard to secure the Sepuchre, which
he readily granted.</HI> [Matth. <HI>xxvii.</HI> 64, 66.] <HI>And it's
likely, had done the same now, to assist the officers of
the High Priest, if any disturbance should happen.</HI></P>
<P>THEN came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and
took him. [<HI>ver.</HI> 50.] <HI>St.</HI> Luke <HI>informs us, that when
they came to apprehend</HI> Jesus, He said unto the chief
priests and <HI>CAPTAINS OF THE TEMPLE</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, and the el∣ders
which were come to him; be ye come out as against a
thief, with swords and staves? [<HI>Luke xxii.</HI> 52.] <HI>And
St.</HI> John <HI>saies, Ch. xviii.</HI> 12, 13. <HI>Then the</HI> Band and
the <HI>CAPTAIN</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, <HI>and</HI> officers of the <HI>Jews</HI> took Jesus,
and bound him, and led him away. <HI>Who this Captain,
or Captains of the Temple were, whether</HI> Roman or
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>
Jewish <HI>officers, has been doubted. I think, they were</HI>
Jewish <HI>officers, who presided there over the Priests
and Levites, and the inferior officers of the temple</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. ad Matt. Xxvi. 45. Whitby, Luke xxii. 52.</NOTE>.
<HI>This I may shew more particularly hereafter, but now
we pass on.</HI> And they that laid hold on <HI>Jesus,</HI> led him
away to <HI>Caiaphas</HI> the high priest, where the Scribes and
Elders were assembled. [<HI>Matth. xxvi.</HI> 57.] Now the
chief priests and elders, and all the council, sought false
witnesse against <HI>Jesus,</HI> to put him to death, but found none:
Yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they
nene. At last came two false witnesses, and said, This fel∣low
said, I am able to destroy this temple and build it in
three daies. And the high priest arose, and said, An∣swerest
thou nothing? What is it that these witnesse against
thee? But <HI>Jesus</HI> held his peace. And the high Priest an∣swered
and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God,
that thou tell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of
God. <HI>Jesus</HI> saith unto him, then hast said: nevertheless
I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sit∣ting
on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds
of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying,
he hath spoken blasphemy:—What think ye? They an∣swered
and said, He is guilty of death, [<HI>ver.</HI> 59,—66.]</P>
<P>ST. Mark <HI>delivers their sentence in these words,</HI>
Then the high priest saith—Ye have heard the blasphemy?
What think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty
of death, <HI>Mark xiv.</HI> 64.</P>
<P>THESE are the proceedings of the council, whilst
Jesus was before them.</P>
<P>WHEN the morning was corns, all the chief priests,
and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put
him to death. And when they had bound him, they led him
away and delivered him to <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> the governour,
<HI>Matth. xxvii.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>See Mark xv.</HI> 1. <HI>Luke xxiii.</HI> 1.</P>
<P><HI>ST.</HI> John <HI>observes, that the</HI> Jewish <HI>elders not en∣tering
into</HI> the Judgment-hall, left they should be defiled,
<HI>Pilate</HI> went out unto them, and said, what accusation
sring you against this man, <HI>John xviii.</HI> 28, 29.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="67"/>
<HI>HAVING heard from them what things they had
to lay to his charge,</HI> Pilate <HI>examin'd</HI> Jesus: having so
<HI>done,</HI> he said to the chief priests and the people, I find no
fault in this man, and they were the more fierce, saying,
he stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all <HI>Jury,</HI>
beginning from <HI>Galilee</HI> to this place. [<HI>Luke xxiii.</HI> 4—8.]
When <HI>Pilate</HI> heard of Galilee, <HI>he sent</HI> Jesus to Herod
<HI>who was then at</HI> Jerusalem.—<HI>He having mock'd him
sent him again to</HI> Pilate. <HI>Being therefore again re∣turned
to him,</HI> Pilate, when he had called together the
chief priests and the rulers, and the people, said unto them,
Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth
the people: and behold, I having examined him before
you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things
whereof you accuse him. No, nor yet <HI>Herod</HI>—I will
therefore chastise him and release him. [<HI>v.</HI> 13—16] They
Sunil
desired that he would rather release Barabbas; Pilate
therefore willing to releafe <HI>Jesus,</HI> spake again to them: but
they cried, faying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him. And he
[aid unto them the third time, Why what evil has he done?
I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore
chaftise him and let him go. And they were instant with
loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified, and the
voices of them, and of the chief priests prevailed, and
<HI>Pilate</HI> gave sentence, that it should be as they required.
[<HI>ver.</HI> 17—24.]</P>
<P>A few remarks will be needful. The <HI>Jewish</HI> councel
having judged that Jesus was guilty of death, or that
according to their law he deserved to die, they carry
him to <HI>Pilate,</HI> and produce their charges against him.
It's surprizing that they should do this, if they had
themselves the power of life and death. A people
fond of authority and power would not have commit∣ted
to a foreigner a cause that was within their own
jurisdiction. If they had not the power of life and
death in this case, they had it not in any other. For
the only crime, that Jesus was supposed to be convict∣ed
of before them, was that of <HI>blasphemy,</HI> or assuming
without foundation the character of the Messias. The
<PB N="52" REF="68"/>
Evangelists are extremely unanimous in this point:
<HI>That the high priests, and all the council sought false wit∣ness
against him but found none, yea, though many false
witness came, yet found they none,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 59,
60. <HI>Many bare false witness against him, but their wit∣ness
agreed not together,</HI> Mark xiv. 56. St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
[Ch. xxvi. 63—66.] St. <HI>Mark</HI> [Ch. xiv. 60—64.] St.
<HI>Luke</HI> [Ch. xxii. 69—71.] have particularly informed
us, that the condemnation passed by the council upon
Jesus was founded upon the declaration he made, that
he was the Christ, when the High Priest had adjured him
to tell them who he was. And St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xix. 7.]
saies, this was what they insisted on before <HI>Pilate: We
Lave a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he
made himself the Son of God.</HI> As therefore the only fact,
which they had the proof of, was that of our Lord's
own confession made before them, which they called
blasphemy; if they had had the power of inflicting
death in this case, they would have punished him ac∣cordingly,
by their own authority, and not have car∣ried
him to <HI>Pilate.</HI></P>
<P>THEY did indeed accuse him before <HI>Pilate of many
things,</HI> and said, <HI>he stirred up the people,</HI> and the like.
But these appear to have been merely malicious in∣ventions
of their own, without any ground in the lest
from any action they knew of, or that had been
proved, when he was under examination before them:
or else, were conclusions they pretended to draw, and
insinuated to the Governour, must be the conse∣quence
of Jesus's confession and declaration, <HI>that
he was the Christ.</HI> And it seems to me, that this
declaration of his was the only ground of all these
charges, from what St. <HI>Luke</HI> saies, <HI>and they began
to accuse him, saying, we found this fellow perverting
the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, say∣ing,</HI>
THAT HE HIMSELF IS CHRIST A KING, <HI>Luke</HI>
xxiii. 2; as also from what St. <HI>John</HI> relates: <HI>The</HI> Jews
cried, <HI>saying, if thou let this man go thou art not</HI> Cesar's
<HI>friend: Wheresoever</HI> MAKETH HIMSELF A KIKG, <HI>speak∣eth
<PB N="53" REF="69"/>
against</HI> Cesar, <HI>John</HI> xix. 13. As likewise, because
that this was the thing, which <HI>Pilate</HI> seems more espe∣cially
to have informed himself about. For he asked
him, <HI>Art thou the King of the</HI> Jews, <HI>John</HI> xvii. 33.
Where we have the answer that Jesus returned him∣to
<HI>ver.</HI> 38. <HI>Pilate</HI> perceiving there was nothing cri∣minal
in this pretension of Jesus, went out again un∣to
the <HI>Jews,</HI> and saith unto them; <HI>I find in him no
fault at all.</HI> There being no crime in this, he was
fully satisfied of his innocence.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, it will be objected against this, that
the title set upon the Cross, of <HI>Jesus</HI> of Nazareth,
<HI>King of the</HI> Jews, is a proof the crime he was condem∣ned
for by <HI>Pilate</HI> was that of sedition, or High Trea∣son.
But I think, this is no proof of any such thing.
For, <HI>Pilate</HI> judging, that our Saviour was really inno∣cent,
[since it was the Roman Custom to put some
title,] might write what he pleased. And our Lord
had satisfied <HI>Pilate,</HI> there was nothing seditious in
that claim he made under that character, forasmuch
as his Kingdome was not of this world. But I contend
not about this. It is not at all material what was the
pretended crime for which <HI>Pilate</HI> at last condemned
Jesus.</P>
<P>BLASPHEMY was the only crime, of which Jesus
was supposed to be convicted before the Councel; and
yet these Jewish High Priests and Elders carried him
to the Governour; and it appears from the sequel,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> was the supreme Judge in this cause, and
the matter of the event. For he gives the case a fresh
hearing, asks the Jews what accusation they brought,
examined Jesus; and when he had done so, told them,
he <HI>found in him no fault at all.</HI> This his conduct is a
full proof that He was the Judge, and that they were
only prosecutors and accusers.</P>
<P>PILATE indeed proposes to them, which he
should release to them, <HI>Barabbas,</HI> or Jesus. But cer∣tainly,
he does not appeal to them as Judges. This
is evident from the Persons, to whom he addressed
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>
himself with this proposal, namely, the <HI>people,</HI> the
<HI>multitude;</HI> which never had, among the <HI>Jews,</HI> a legal
power of life and death. <HI>At that Feast the Governour
was wont to release unto the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>a prisoner, whom
they would,</HI> Matth. xxviii. 15. <HI>Therefore when they
were gathered together,</HI> Pilate <HI>said unto them, Whom
will ye that I release unto you,</HI> ver. 17. <HI>But the chief
priests and elders persuaded the</HI> MULTITUDE <HI>that they
should ask</HI> Barabbas <HI>and destroy Jesus,</HI> ver. 20. <HI>See</HI>
Mark xv. 8—15. This appeal to the <HI>people</HI> seems to
have been only to discern how far he might act in this
matter consistent with the peace of the province, which
depended upon the disposition of the people.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Pilate</HI> at length pronounced the
Sentence. He wrote the <HI>Title</HI> upon the Cross, and
would not alter what he had written, though desired
by the high priests, <HI>John</HI> xix. 19. When the Sentence
was pronounced, [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxvii. 27, 28.] the <HI>Soldiers
of the Governour took Jesus into the common Hall, and
gathered unto them the whole band of Soldiers, and they
stripped him, and put on him a scarlet Robe, and led him
away to crucify him,</HI>—31. The crucifixion was per∣formed
by these Soldiers under the command of a Cen∣turion,
—54. Joseph of Arimathea <HI>went to</HI> PILATE
<HI>and begged the body of Jesus. Then</HI> PILATE <HI>commanded
the body to be delivered,</HI>—58. <HI>The chief Priests and
Pharisees came to</HI> PILATE, <HI>desiring that he would com∣mand
that the Sepulchre be made sure until the third day—</HI>
Pilate <HI>said unto them, ye have a watch, go your way,
make it as sure as ye can. So they went and made the Se∣pulchre
sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch,—66.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THESE Soldiers were entirely accountable to</HI> Pilate.
<HI>For when</HI> some of the watch came into the City shewed
unto the chief priests all the things that were done—they
gave large money unto the Soldiers, saying, say ye, his
disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept:
And if this come to the <HI>GOVERNOUR's</HI> ears, we will per∣suade
<HI>HIM</HI> and secure you, <HI>Matth. xxviii.</HI> 11—14.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="71"/>
BESIDE the light we receive into this matter from
the proceedings relating to our Saviour himself; we
learn that <HI>Pilate</HI> had in his custody divers prisoners,
which were of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation: for it could be such
only, that it can be supposed, they should desire to
have released to them: and it seems, it had been an
usual custom with him during his government, to re∣lease
to them some prisoner at that Feast; <HI>and the mul∣titude
crying aloud, began to desire him to do as he had
ever done unto them,</HI> Mark xv. 8. <HI>See</HI> Matth. xxvii. 15.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Pilate</HI> said unto them, TAKE YE HIM, <HI>and
judge him according to your Law. The Jews said unto
him,</HI> IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR US TO PUT ANY MAN
TO DEATH, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 31.</P>
<P>As <HI>they</HI> here affirm expresly, that they had not the
power of life and death; so <HI>Pilate</HI> told our Saviour
that He had. <HI>Then</HI> Pilate <HI>said unto him,—knowest thou
not, that I have Power to crucify thee, and have power to
release thee,</HI> John xix. 10.</P>
<P>So that the whole course of the proceedings in this
transaction, and these express declarations of these two
parties, the High Priests and Elders on the one hand,
and <HI>Pilate</HI> on the other, assure us, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> na∣tion
had not, at this time, within themselves, the power
of life and death, upon any occasion.</P>
<P>§. VI. BUT yet, there are some expressions of the
Evangelists relating to this matter that may require
consideration.</P>
<P>1. <HI>THERE is a prediction of our Lord concerning
the manner of his death related by</HI> John,<HI>[Ch. xii. 32.]
with the Evangelist's own reflexion:</HI> And I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
This he said signifying what death he should die. St. John
[Ch. xviii. 31, 33.] Then <HI>Pilate</HI> said unto them take ye
him, and judge him according to your Law. The <HI>Jews</HI>
therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to pit
any man to death. That the saying of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he
should die.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="72"/>
POSSIBLY, some may hence conclude, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> had the power os putting men to death; and
therefore the Evangelist observes, that the fulfilment
of this prediction was remarkable: Since though they
had the power yet they disclaim'd, and would not
exercise it upon this occasion.</P>
<P>BUT without this supposition, the accomplishment
of this prediction is remarkable on two accounts.
<HI>First,</HI> In that he did not die a natural death; and
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That He was not put to death in a tumult;
but his death was the result of a legal processe ac∣cording
to the form of government which then ob∣tained
in that country. No man, without a prophe∣tic
Spirit, could foresee certainly, that he should not
die a natural death; and yet, perhaps it was more
extraordinary to foresee, that he should escape all the
sudden attempts upon his life. We have many of
these recorded in the Evangelists: But notwistand∣ing
he suffered as a criminal by the sentence of the
government.</P>
<P>AND the meaning of the Evangelists in the last
mentioned place, I think, is this: The <HI>Jews</HI> said, It
is not lawful for us to put any man to death; and
hereby, <HI>i. e.</HI> by their not having the power of inflict∣ing
capital punishments, it came to pass, that the
words of Jesus were fulfilled, in which he had pre∣dicted,
that he should <HI>be crucified,</HI> that being a <HI>Roman</HI>
and not an ordinary <HI>Jewish</HI> punishment.</P>
<P>2. PERHAPS, some may think their departing
willingly at this time from their right is implied in
the phrase, <HI>delivering up to the</HI> Gentiles; which our
Lord made use of some times, when he spoke of his
death. <HI>Behold we go up to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and the Son of
man shall be delivered unto the chief Priests, and unto the
Scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall</HI>
DELIVER <HI>him to the</HI> Gentiles; <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33. <HI>See Luke</HI>
xviii. 32. and after the councel had condemned Jesus,
<HI>it is said, when they had bound him, they led him away,
<PB N="57" REF="73"/>
and</HI> DELIVERED <HI>him to</HI> Pontius Pilate <HI>the Governour,</HI>
Matth. xxvii. 2.</P>
<P>HEREBY some may be pleased to understand, that
for some reasons the <HI>Jews</HI> voluntarily surrendered him
to <HI>Pilate;</HI> tho' if they had thought fit, they might
have put him to death themselves.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the meaning of this word in the <HI>New
Testament,</HI> as is evident from <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33. the first text
here quoted. <HI>Judas,</HI> of whom that <HI>delivery to the chief
priests</HI> is intended, released no right. The word is often
used to express the acts of private persons, who accu∣sed,
prosecuted, betraied, or any other way contri∣buted
to the bringing another before a court of Ju∣stice,
in order to be condemned and put to death.
<HI>But beware of Men, for they will</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up to the
councels, and they will scourge you in their Synagogues,
and ye shall be brought before governours and kings for
my sake—but when they</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up, take no
thought, how, or what ye shall speak.—And the bro∣ther
shall</HI> DELIVER <HI>the brother to death, and the father
the child,</HI> Matth. x. 17—21 <HI>But when they shall lead
you and</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up, take no thought before hand,</HI>
Mark xiii. II. and in the next verse <HI>betraying</HI> is used
for <HI>delivering. Now the brother</HI> shall <HI>betray the brother,
and the father the Son.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>BUT still some may suspect that they might
have some particular reasons, for not employing at
this time all the authority they were possessed of. For
St.</HI> Luke [Ch. xxii. 2.] saies, And the chief Priests and
Scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared
the people. <HI>And St.</HI> Matthew, [Ch. xxvi. 4, 5.] that
they consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and
kill him. But they said, not on the feast day lest there be
an uproar among the people. <HI>Possibly therefore, sus∣pecting
the affections of the people, they might be
willing to decline the odium of this action, and throw
it upon</HI> Pilate.</P>
<P>BUT whatever apprehensions they might have
concerning the <HI>people,</HI> at first; yet when they had
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>
seised Jesus without any disturbance, and many had
shewn their forwardnesse in coming in to them, and
bringing them false accusations against him, these
fears might then be pretty well over. And certainly,
they could be in no fear of the people, after the mul∣titude
had unanimously demanded with loud voices,
that <HI>Barabbas</HI> might he released, and Jesus crucified.
For that offer which <HI>Pilate</HI> made them, <HI>saying, take
ye him and crucify him,</HI> John xix. 6. was plainly after
that the people had petitioned for <HI>Barabbas. Then
cried they all again, saying not this man but</HI> Barabbas,
Ch. xviii. 40. If they could have put any man to
death, would not they now have joyfully accepted
this offer which <HI>Pilate</HI> made them? Would they not
have been willing now to merit with the people, by
putting to death a man whom they disliked as well as
themselves, if before, they were afraid to kill one,
whom they suspected the people were fond of?</P>
<P>4. AND this brings me to another difficulty. For
it may be said; If the <HI>Jews</HI> had not the power of life
and death, what could <HI>Pilate</HI> mean, by saying, <HI>Take
ye him, and judge him according to your Law?</HI> John
xviii. 31. And again, <HI>Take ye him and crucify him, for
I find no fault in him?</HI> Ch. xix. 6.</P>
<P>I answer, that <HI>Pilate's</HI> meaning in the first. place is
very evident, and the answer they make him shews,
they had not the power of life and death. The con∣text
is thus: <HI>Then led they Jesus from</HI> Caiaphas <HI>unto
the hall of judgment.</HI> They scrupling to go in, Pilate
<HI>went out unto them, and said, what accusation bring you
against this man? They answered and said unto him, if
he were not a malefactour we would not have delivered
him up unto thee. Then said</HI> Pilate, <HI>take ye him and
judge him according to your Law,</HI> that is, Go then and
punish him your selves. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>therefore said unto
him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</HI> [John
xviii. 28—31.] that is, “This is a criminal we can∣not
punish according to his deserts. 'Tis not one
of the lesser faults, for which we are wont to scourge

men, or to cast out of the Synagogue; but he is
guilty of blasphemy, which by our Law ought to
be punished with death. And since we are not
permitted to punish any man capitally, we have
brought him to your tribunal, where alone we can
have satisfaction.”</P>
<P>THE other words are thus introduced: <HI>Pilate</HI> had
scourged Jesus, platted a crown of thorns upon him,
and offered him other indignities, hoping hereby to
pacifie the <HI>Jewish</HI> rage, and save his life: and goes
out <HI>and saith unto them, behold I bring him forth to you,
that you? may know that I find no fault in him:</HI> he is an
innocent man, and I cannot punish him as you desire.
<HI>When the chief Priests therefore, and Officers saw him,
they cried out saying, crucifie him, crucifie him.</HI> Pilate
<HI>saith unto them, Take ye him and crucifie him, for I find
no fault in him,</HI> John xix. 1—6. It's not unlikely,
that some may suppose, the word <HI>crucifie</HI> here, ought
to be interpreted by the general word <HI>judge,</HI> used be∣fore.
But I think, the most natural meaning of <HI>Pi∣late's</HI>
words here is this. “You must crucifie him
then your selves, if you can commit such a villany,
for I cannot. He appears to me innocent, as I
have told you already; and I have now punished
him as much, or more than he deserves.”</P>
<P>THE answer they make again goes upon the Sup∣position,
that they could not take away any man's
life. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>answered him, we have a law, and by
our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son
of God,</HI> ver. 7. that is, “Indeed, Sir, you need not
be so scrupulous: He is a blasphemer; and by
our law all such ought to be put to death. And
if you do not condemn him to death, we shall
think you do not pay that respect to our law which
you ought to do”. And then they threaten him
with the general resentment of the nation, if he would
not punish capitally the most heinous violation of
their law.

THIS discourse, which now passed between <HI>Pilate</HI>
and the chief priests, is a proof, they had not the
power of life and death; and that the intent of what
<HI>Pilate</HI> said, is not, that they might crucifie him if
they pleased: If this had been <HI>Pilate</HI>'s meaning, and
they could have legally executed Jesus, would they
have put a matter they were intent upon to an un∣certain
issue? would they have refused to take the
cause into their own hands, when they saw the Gover∣nour
was backward to gratify their intentions? Their
still pressing <HI>Pilate</HI> to pronounce a Sentence of death
is a proof, that they knew very well, if Jesus was not
condemned by <HI>Pilate,</HI> he must be set at liberty.</P>
<P>5. BUT though these particulars, thus laid toge∣ther,
appear decisive, and the <HI>Jews</HI> here, in a most
critical Season, say expresly that it was <HI>not lawful for
them to put any man to death;</HI> yet in another place,
there are some <HI>Jews,</HI> who seem to assert, they had at
this time an absolute freedom. Then <HI>said Jesus unto
the</HI> Jews <HI>which believed on him, if ye continue in my
words, then are ye my disciples indeed. And ye shall
know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They
answered him, we be</HI> Abraham'<HI>s Seed,</HI> AND WERE NE∣VER
IN BONDAGE TO ANY MAN: How SAYEST THOU,
YE SHALL BE MADE FREE? <HI>John</HI> Viii. 3I—33.</P>
<P>IT is not very material to enquire at present, who
they were who made this reply to our Saviour; whe∣ther
the <HI>Believers</HI> before spoken of, who seem not to
have owned him upon right grounds, or “whether they
were unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who hypocritically joined
themselves with these new professors, with intent of
taking some private opportunity of killing him.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dr. <HI>Clarke's</HI> Paraphrase upon this text,</NOTE>.”
What we are concerned with is the reply it self.</P>
<P>IF these <HI>Jews</HI> do not speak here of civil temporal
liberty, and of a freedom from all foreign jurisdicti∣on,
then we have no concern with them at present;
but if they do (as it is generally supposed) they de∣serve
<PB N="61" REF="79"/>
no regard at all: For then, what they here say
is a downright contradiction of God himself in the
solemn preamble to the law at Mount <HI>Sinai, I am
the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of</HI>
Egypt, <HI>out of the house of bondage.</HI> There is no rely∣ing
upon the word of such men as these. Notwith∣standing
they ask, <HI>How say est thou, ye shall be made
free?</HI> as if they could be no freer than they were,
they might at that time be downright Slaves. For
they who scrupled not to contradict God himself,
with reference to the time past, might well have assu∣rance
to deny a sad evident to every man's sense and
reason at that time. Our Lord indeed does not deny
the truth of what they said: It was to no purpose so
to do. But with an unexampled firmnesse he prose∣cutes
the subject he was upon: <HI>Jesus answered them,
verily I say unto you, whosoever committeth Sin is the ser∣vant
of Sin,</HI> ver. 34.</P>
<P>BUT though the moll: express declarations of such
men can never assure us of the truth, yet their angry
reply to our Saviour, this fierce disclaiming the charge
of subjection, upon so small, upon no occasion at all,
affords more than a presumption they were not free at
this time. An insinuation of their being in subjection,
if such had been given, would have been treated with
contempt, and not answered with indignation, if they
had had all the power their proud hearts desired.</P>
<P>6. THERE is another text hitherto omitted, which
some may think deserves notice. <HI>Then gathered the
chief Priests and the Pharisees a councel, and said, What
do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let this
man alone, all men will believe on him,</HI> AND THE RO∣MANS
SHALL COME, AND TAKE AWAY BOTH OUR
PLACE AND NATION, <HI>John</HI> xi. 47, 48. Some may
apprehend these words imply, that there was then no
Roman Government established in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>I presume, there is no necessity of enquiring at pre∣sent
into the views of this Speech. All I shall say by
way of answer is, 1. That this Speech supposes that
<PB N="62" REF="80"/>
they were then in Subjection to the <HI>Romans;</HI> other∣wise,
<HI>all mens beleiving on Jesus</HI> could not have been
any offense to the <HI>Romans,</HI> or be pretended to be so.</P>
<P>2. The meaning of these words is, that then the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
would no longer protect them in their religion
and laws, and treat them as subjects, but send an ar∣my
to destroy them, as rebels and enemies.</P>
<P>A passage of <HI>Josephus</HI> will illustrate this text. The
<HI>Samaritans</HI> had obstructed the <HI>Galileans</HI> in their way to
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and killed some of them. The chief men
of <HI>Galilee</HI> complain to <HI>Cumanus</HI> the Procurator, and
demanded Justice. He took a bribe from the <HI>Sama∣ritans,</HI>
and let the matter pass. “The <HI>Galileans</HI> then
being exasperated, perswaded the Multitude of the
<HI>Jews</HI> to betake themselves to arms and assert their
liberty. Servitude, they said, was grievous in it
self, but to be insulted under it was altogether in∣tolerable
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>” <HI>Josephus</HI> saies, that the chief men
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> dreading the issue, endeavoured by all
means to appease the people; and bid them, set be∣fore
their “eyes the utter ruine of their country, the
conflagration of their temple, the captivity and
slavery of themselves, their wives and children;
and as they would avoid these dreadful calamities,
beseeched them to alter their present designs.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Joseph. Ant. lib. 20, cap. v. §. 1.</NOTE>.”
What is this, but the <HI>Romans coining and taking away
both their place and nation?</HI> Which words, as I obser∣ved,
imply a present subjection: and this state they
appear evidently to have been in, when that exhor∣tation
was given, which I have just transcribed from
<HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>I have now set before the reader the main passages
of this period, concerning the power the <HI>Jews</HI> were
<PB N="63" REF="81"/>
possessed of in their own country. The sum is, They
practised their own religious rites, worshiped at the
Temple and in their Synagogues, followed their own
customs, and lived very much according to their own
laws. They had their high priests, a Councel or Se∣nate,
inflicted lesser punishments; they could appre∣hend
men, and bring them before the Council, and if
a guard of soldiers was needful, could be assisted by
them, upon asking the Governour for them: they could
bind men and keep them in custody: The Council
could summon witnesses, take examinations, and when
they had any capital offenders carry them before the
Governour. This Governour usually paid a regard
to what they offered; and if they brought evidence of
the fact, pronounced sentence according to their laws.
But he was the proper judge in all capital causes, for
when the Council of the <HI>Jews</HI> had had before them a
case, which they pretended was of this kind, having
prepared it, they go with it immediately to the Go∣vernour,
who re-examines it, and pronounces the
sentence</P>
<P>§. VII. THE next <HI>Period</HI> reaches from our Savi∣our's
resurrection to the reign of <HI>Herod</HI> mentioned in
the Twelfth <HI>of the Acts of the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>I shall set down all the facts mentioned in this in∣terval,
which relate to this subject; after I have just
observed, that we have here no notice taken of any
Roman Officer or President in the Country: It does
not follow, there was none all this time, but it was
proper to observe it here, though the reason of this
omission do not appear. And this is one reason why
I have made a distinct period of this interval.</P>
<P>I. <HI>THE first fact is a case that followed soon after
the cure wrought by</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> John <HI>upon the lame
man that lay at the gate of the Temple.</HI>—And as
they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of
the temple, and the <HI>Sadducees</HI> came upon them—and they
laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it was now even tide, <HI>Acts iv.</HI> 1—3.—and it
<PB N="64" REF="82"/>
came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders
and scribes, and <HI>Annas</HI> the high priest, and <HI>Caiaphas</HI>—were
gathered together at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And when they had
set them in the midst, they asked, by what power, or in
what name have ye done this? Then <HI>Peter</HI> filled with
the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people
and elders of <HI>Israel, [ver.</HI> 5—10.]—Be, it known unto
you.—Peter <HI>having made his defense</HI>—When they
had commanded them [<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI>] to go aside out
of the councel, they conferred among them selves. <HI>Their
resolution was,</HI>—That it spread no further among the
people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak hence
forth to no man in this name—and having threatened them
they let them go, <HI>ver.</HI> 15—21.</P>
<P>A council was called; <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were appre∣hended
by <HI>Jewish</HI> officers, put in prison, brought be∣fore
the Council, examin'd, threatened, dismissed.
No penalty is inflicted, and what punishment was
threatened is not said.</P>
<P>2. THE next case is in the following chapter. <HI>Then
the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him
(which is the sect of the</HI> Sadducees) <HI>and were filled with
indignation. And laid their hands on the Apostles, and
put them in the common prison,</HI> Acts v. 17, 18 The
Apostles were delivered out of prison that night by
an Angel, and went to the <HI>temple, early in the morn∣ing,
and taught. But the high priest came, and they
that were with him, and called the council together, and
all the Senate of the children of</HI> Israel, <HI>and sent to the
prison to have them brought.</HI>—The officers not find∣ing
them in the prison, returned to the Council, in∣forming
them of it. <HI>Now when the high priest and the
captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these
things they doubted of them, whereunto they would grow.</HI>
Having received information that the Apostles were
in the temple, <HI>Then went the Captain with the Officers,
and brought them without violence—And when they bad
brought them, they set them before the council: and the
high priest asked them, saying, did not we straitly com∣mand
<PB N="65" REF="83"/>
you that ye should not teach in this name?</HI> v. 21—28.
<HI>Peter</HI> and the rest of the Apostles made their defense.
<HI>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and
took counsel slay them. Gamaliel</HI> then stood up, and
desired the Apostles to be put forth a little space: and
gave his opinion in these words; <HI>And now I say unto you,
refrain from these men and let them alone.—And to him
they agreed. And when they had called the Apostles and
beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in
the name of Jesus, and let them go,</HI>—40.</P>
<P>WE have here a fact, or circumstance or two, not
mentioned before. The Apostles were put into <HI>the
common Prison</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>. But we are told in the former in∣stance
in this period, [<HI>Acts</HI> iv. 3.] <HI>they laid hands on
them</HI> [Peter <HI>and</HI> John] <HI>and put them in hold</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, <HI>unto
the next day.</HI> And in the former period we find, that
our Saviour was <HI>bound</HI> by the High Priest's Authori∣ty.
St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xviii. 12.] saies, he was bound as
soon as apprehended; <HI>Then the Band, and the Cap∣tain,
and Officers of the</HI> Jews, <HI>took Jesus and</HI> BOUND
him. Though St. <HI>Matthew</HI> does not speak of it, till
he comes to relate his being carried from the High
Priest to <HI>Pilate:</HI> and <HI>when they had bound him, they led
him away, and delivered him to</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>Matth.</HI>
xxvii. 2. See <HI>Mark</HI> xv. I.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there can be no doubt, I think, but
the power of apprehending implies also the power of
keeping in custody. Sometimes a prisoner might be
kept all night in the High Priest's house, as our Savi∣our
seems to have been, when they intended to meet
again the next morning. At other times they might
send their prisoners to the common or public prison,
as in the case before us; for it's not at all unlikely,
that they had the free use of it, and that the place of
confinement was at their own discretion.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="84"/>
ANOTHER particular here is, that the Apostles
were <HI>beaten.</HI> We often meet in the <HI>New Testament</HI>
with whipping in the Synagogues: but its likely, this
was a more public beating. And possibly the Ruler,
and chief men of every Synagogue had the right of
appointing a whipping there: This punishment now
ordered by the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> its likely, was in sme o∣pen
market place, whereby the suffers were expo∣sed:
and therefore, it's sid, <HI>And they departed, from
the presence of the council rejoycing that they were counted
worthy to suffer</HI> SHAME <HI>for his name,</HI> Acts v. 41.</P>
<P>THERE is one thing more, we ought to observe
here; the Apostles were beaten, and yet it is said,
that they agreed to <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> whose advice was, that
they should refrain from these men <HI>and let them alone.</HI>
This implies, that they had the power of inflicting,
or procuring at left, a heavier punishment than that
of <HI>whipping</HI> or <HI>beating.</HI> And it is sid, they TOOK
COUNSEL TO SLAY THEM. But I think, this does not
imply, that they could by their own authority put
them to death. Forasmuch as this is sid of their de∣singns
against Jesus; and yet it has appeared, I pre∣sume,
that they could not themselves, legally, or ac∣cording
to the constitution of things at that time, put
him to death. Thus St. <HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. xxvi. 3, 4.]
saies, <HI>Then assembled together the chief priests and the
scribes and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the
high priest—and consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty and kill him:</HI> See <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 2, 3. And after he
had been apprehended, examined, convicted, and
condemned by them, as far as their authority reach∣ed.
—<HI>When the morning was come, all the chief priests
and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put
him to death,</HI> Matth. xxvii. I. See Mark xv. 1. As
therefore, the meaning of this phrase in the <HI>Gospels,</HI>
when used concerning their proceedings against our
Saviour, can mean no more, than their resolving to
prosecute him before the Governour, as a criminal
worthy of death, and consulting together how they
<PB N="67" REF="85"/>
might manage the prosecution, and get him condem∣ned
to death; so it's not unlikely, that the phrase ought
to be understood in the same sense here: And when
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> advises them <HI>to refrain from these men and let
than alone,</HI> for any thing that appears, he must be
understood to disswade them from pursuing their re∣sentment,
so far as to prosecute them before the go∣vernour,
as men worthy of death; and only to
threaten them afresh; and if they thought fit, order
them to be beaten, as we find they did.</P>
<P>3. THE next affair of this kind, which we meet
with in the <HI>Acts,</HI> is the prosecution and death of <HI>Ste∣phen:</HI>
the occasion and circumstances of which are re∣lated
in this manner.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Stephen</HI> full of faith and power, did great
wonders and miracles among the people. Then there arose
certain of the Synagogue, which is called the Synagogue of
the Libertines,—disputing with <HI>Stephen.</HI> And they were
not able to resist the Wisdom and the Spirit by which he
spake. Then they suborned men, which said, we have
heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and
against God. And they stirred up the people, and the el∣ders,
and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught
him and brought him to the councel; and set up false wit∣nesses,
which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphe∣mous
words against this holy place and the law. For we
have heard him say, That this Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> shall
destroy this place; and shall change the customs which
<HI>Moses</HI> delivered us. And all that sat in the councel, look∣ing
stedfastly on him, saw his face, as it had been the face
of an angel, <HI>Acts vi.</HI> 8—15. Then said the high priest,
are these things so? <HI>Stephen then made his Speech,</HI> Ch.
vii. I.—53. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they heard these things, they were cut
to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
But he being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus stand∣ing
on the right hand of God. Then they cried out with
a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him
with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned
<PB N="68" REF="86"/>
him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young
man's feet, whose name was <HI>Saul:</HI> And they stoned <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>
calling upon God, and saying. Lord Jesus receive
my Spirit, <HI>ver.</HI> 54—60. <HI>To which ought to be sub∣joined
some expressions of</HI> Paul, <HI>in his Speech to the
people at</HI> Jerussalem. And when the blood of thy martyr
<HI>Stephen</HI> was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting
to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him,
<HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 20.</P>
<P>HERE we have a case, in many particulars diffe∣rent
from any, we have yet met with. Here is not
only a man brought before the councel, and witnesses
heard, but he is put to death, by stoning, an ordinary
<HI>Jewish</HI> punishment, without any mention of his being
prosecuted before a Roman Magistrate. And it
has, in the conclusion, very much the appearance
of a legal <HI>Jewish</HI> Punishment; for the witnesses
seem to have stoned him, or thrown the first stone
at him.</P>
<P>THE reader will be pleased now to recollect a pre∣vious
proposition, which was laid down at the begin∣ning
of this enquiry; namely, that the sacred Histo∣rians
are not accountable for the legality of the facts,
or proceedings, which they relate. Though this af∣fair
should be allowed to have all the forms of a legal
processe sentence and punishment, according to the
<HI>Jewish</HI> law and customs; yet it does not follow, that
it was rightful, according to the constitution they
were then under. It's certain that Magistrates do
sometimes transgress the bounds of their authority,
as well as people commit disorders. We have a plain
instance of this at <HI>Philippi:</HI> [Acts xv.] where the ma∣gistrates commanded <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> to be beaten and
imprisoned. But in this their sudden passion, they
acted very irregularly; as they were soon sensible
themselves. And it is not impossible, but the <HI>Jewish</HI>
Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in compliance with their own
malice, and the clamours of the people, might pro∣nounce a Sentence, that exceeded the bounds of their
<PB N="69" REF="87"/>
authority, and execute it, before the Roman officer
could come in to prevent it.</P>
<P>THIS might be said, supposing there were here
the compleat form of a legal processe; which I think
there is not. It is true, here were witnesses they
bring their charge; but here is no Sentence pronoun∣ced
by the councel; not one word of it. Nor does
the High Priest collect the opinions. If this had been
done, 'tis not likely, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> would have omit∣ted
it. In the account of the proceedings against our
Saviour, [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 66. <HI>Mark</HI> xiv. 64.] particular
mention is made of the High Priest's asking the coun∣cel
their opinion; <HI>What think ye?</HI> and of the ansswer
they made, <HI>He is guilty of death.</HI> And St. <HI>Luke</HI> [Ch.
xxii. 71.] has given the result of their debates: <HI>And
they said, what need we any further witnesses? for we
our selves have heard of his own mouth.</HI> In the two
cases already considered in this period, St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
informed us, not only of the accusations against the
prisoners, and the defense they made, but of the de∣bates
of the Council, after the prisoners had been
heard. These were ordered to go aside, there are de∣bates,
and the final resolution is taken, and then the
prisoners are called in again, and the Sentence is pro∣nounced.
Concerning <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> see <HI>Acts</HI> iv.
15—18. of the Apostles, Ch. v. 34—40.</P>
<P>AND in the present case, after the witnesses, which
they had suborned, had delivered their accusations;
Then <HI>said the High Priest, Are these things so?</HI> Acts
vii. 1. That is, he gave <HI>Stephen</HI> leave to make his de∣fense.
If after <HI>Stephen</HI> had done, the council had or∣dered
him to go out; or if there had been any debates
in the council concerning him, or the High Priest
had asked their opinion, and a Sentence had been pro∣nounced;
it is incredible, these things should have
been omitted; as they are entirely. For what St. <HI>Luke</HI>
saies, is, that having heard what <HI>Stephen</HI> said, <HI>they
gnashed on him with their teeth;</HI> and that <HI>he then looking
up to heaven and saying,</HI>—<HI>I see the heavens opened, and
<PB N="70" REF="88"/>
Jesus standing on the right hand of God, then they cried
out with a loud voice,—and ran upon him with one ac∣cord,
and cast him out of the City, and stoned him.</HI> This
has all the appearance of a tumultuous proceeding of
the people, which the councel, probably, had no in∣clination
to check, but were highly pleased with: For
of them I understand those words, When <HI>they heard
these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed
on him with their teeth;</HI> words which represent an un∣governed
rage.</P>
<P>AND if I mistake not, <HI>Stephen</HI> is not convicted
upon the evidence of the witnesses but upon his say∣ing,
<HI>I see the Son of man standing on the right hand of
God, they ran upon him with one accord.</HI></P>
<P>His expressions they termed blasphemous; and
in that case, the <HI>Jewish</HI> people at this time seem to
have made no scruple at all of stoning a man imme∣diately,
without any trial. There are so many in∣stances
of this in the Gospels, that it seems needless to
alledge any in particular. <HI>See</HI> John v. 17. 18. viii.
58, 59. x. 30—39.</P>
<P>AND, as for the appearance of a legal punishment
in these particulars, <HI>that they cast him out of the City
and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their cloths
at a young man's feet, whose name was</HI> Saul; I think,
they cannot prove, that this was not a tumultuous ac∣tion:
for even the most unruly and disorderly multi∣tude
will oftentimes in their utmost extravagances as∣sume
some formalities of a legal procedure.</P>
<P>NOT WITHSTANDING this, there are some learn∣ed
men, who think, this was not a sudden act of the
people, but that it was a punishment inflicted by the
<HI>Jewish</HI> councel. They say that it was not allowed for
a private person to put any man to death for any crime
against their Law, unless they did it whilst the crimi∣nal
was in the very act<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sed uti bene observavit Seldenus, lib. x. de jure nat. &amp; gent. cap. 4. ex zeli judicio, Supplicium capitate in ipso dum committe∣batur facinus duntaxat momento, seu homini <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> depre∣henso, a Zelotis, id est, private zelo ductis infligi permittebatur M.

BUT it may be questioned, whether the scheme of
Zelotism at this time was exactly the same which is
represented in the writings, which these learned men
quote. And though it were, 'tis not impossible, but
when such a principle was countenanced, as that of
the right of private persons to kill men in the <HI>act,</HI>
they might sometimes go beyond the bounds of that
principle. And it is highly probable, that the chief
men of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation, when their authority was
certainly under some restraints, might connive at the
exorbitances of this zeal. 'Tis certain we have in the
<HI>Acts of the Apostles</HI> many instances of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in se∣veral
places, laying in wait for <HI>Paul</HI>'s life; not to
catch him <HI>in the act</HI> of what they might call blasphe∣my,
or any other violation of their law; but to kill
him for facts done by him some time before. 'Tis not
material to enquire, what this was owing to; whether
it ought to be called <HI>Zelotism,</HI> or any thing else. 'Tis
certain these were common practises among them.
One thing, which they seem at this time to have
thought the proper object of this private Zeal, is
what they called Blasphemy. Now a criminal could
not well be punished for this in the very <HI>Act.</HI> The
words must first be out of a man's mouth, before he
could be guilty. Here were words spoken by <HI>Stephen,</HI>
which they termed blasphemy: <HI>Behold I see the hea∣vens
opened, and the Son of man standing at the right
hand of God.</HI> These words were spoken before the
councel, and it's likely, before a good many other
persons, who were present as witnesses and prosecu∣tors,
<PB N="72" REF="90"/>
therefore before <HI>ten</HI> or more persons. And <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>
was put to death with all the expedition possible,
that is, in the very <HI>act</HI> as near as could be. For it
follows immediately; <HI>Then they cried out with a loud
voice, and stopped their eors, and ran upon him with one
accord, and cast him out of the city and stoned him,</HI> Acts
vii. 57, 58.</P>
<P>NOR is the putting <HI>Stephen</HI> to death by <HI>stoning</HI> any
proof, that there had been a Sentence pronounced, or
that there was any legal form observed in his death.
For this was common in their tumultuous attempts.
Jesus having said some things which gave them offense,
<HI>Then the</HI> Jews <HI>took up stones again to stone him,</HI> John
x. 31. He went on to argue with them: They <HI>an∣swered
him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not,
but for blosphemy,</HI> ver. 33. See <HI>John</HI> xi. 7, 8. The
stoning which <HI>Paul</HI> suffered at <HI>Lystra</HI> was merely tu∣multuous.
—<HI>And there came thither certain</HI> Jews
<HI>from</HI> Antioch <HI>and</HI> Iconium, <HI>who persuaded the peo∣ple</HI>
[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the multitude,] <HI>and having stoned</HI>
Paul, <HI>drew him out of the city, supposing he had been
dead,</HI> Acts xiv. 19. Thus much for the Case of
<HI>Stephen.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>IT follows,</HI> And <HI>Saul</HI> was consenting to his death.
And at that time there was a great persecution against the
church which was at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and they were all scat∣tered
abroad throughout the regions of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Sama∣ria,</HI>
except the Apostles, [<HI>Acts</HI> viii. I.]—As for <HI>Saul,</HI>
he made havock of the church, entering into every house,
and haling men and women, committed them to prison,
[<HI>ver.</HI> 3.]—And <HI>Saul,</HI> yet breathing out threatnings and
slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the
high priest, and desired of him letters to <HI>Damascus,</HI> to
the Synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether
they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Acts ix. 1, 2. <HI>When</HI> Ananias, at Damascus,
<HI>was directed in a vision to go to</HI> Saul, he answered,
Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil
he has done to thy saints at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> And here he has
<PB N="73" REF="91"/>
authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy
name, <HI>Ch.</HI> ix. 13, 14.</P>
<P>IT must, I think, be supposed that <HI>Saul</HI> could not
have taken up any at <HI>Damascus,</HI> (which was subject to
<HI>Aretas,</HI>) by the authority of the Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
unless the Governour there gave him leave: and it is
highly probable, the correspondence between them
was such as that he would not refuse it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Acts ix. 23, 24. 2 Cor. xi. 32. &amp; Clerici Hist. Eccles. Ann. xxxi. Num. I.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>AND St.</HI> Paul <HI>saies of himself, in his speech to the
people of</HI> Jerusalem; I persecuted this way unto the
death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and
women, as also the high priest doth bear me witness, and
all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received
letters unto the brethren, and went to <HI>Damascus,</HI> to
bring them which were there, bound unto <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for
to be pumished. [<HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 4, 5.]—And said, Lord,
they how that I imprisoned, and beat in every Synagogue
them that believed on thee: and when the blood of thy
martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> was shed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [<HI>ver.</HI> 19, 20.]</P>
<P><HI>IN his speech to King</HI> Agrippa, Paul saies;—Which
things I also did in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and many of the saints did
I shut up in prison, having received authority from the
chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my
voice against them. And I punished them oft in every syna∣gogue,
and compelled them to blaspheme; and being ex∣ceedingly
mad against them, I persecuted them even unto
strange cities. Whereupon as I went to <HI>Damascus</HI> with
authority and commission chief priests, at mid∣day,
O King, I saw in the way a light from heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Acts xxvi. 9—13.</P>
<P>HERE is a great variety of particulars, <HI>imprison∣ing,
beating in the Synagogue, persecuting into strange
cities, and putting to death.</HI></P>
<P>As for the persecuting into strange cities, it is not
at all surprizing, that the <HI>Jews</HI> should have sufficient
authority and power in their own country, (though
<PB N="74" REF="92"/>
they had a Roman Governour amongst them) to im∣pose
hardships upon the followers of Christ that would
make them leave <HI>Judea;</HI> since as has appeared from
instances in <HI>the Acts of the Apostles</HI> already alledged,
they were able to drive them from one place, and city
to another in <HI>Greece,</HI> and several parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>THE punishments inflicted in the Synagogues must
be supposed inflicted by a mere <HI>Jewish</HI> authority, since
they had the free exercise of their religion.</P>
<P>THE Apostle saies alsso expressly, that <HI>many of the
saints</HI> did he imprison by <HI>authority from the chief priests.</HI>
When he says, he <HI>persecuted this way unto the death;</HI> I
think, he expresses his aim and design; and that in
the opposition he had made against the followers of
Jesus, he proposed to bring upon them not the lesser
punishments only of fines, whipping or imprison∣ment,
but death it self.</P>
<P>THE case of the loss of life is that of <HI>Stephen,</HI>
whose death, he saies, he was consenting to, and kept
the <HI>raiment of them that slew him.</HI> Beside this, in his
speech to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> he saies, <HI>and when they were put to
death, I gave my voice against them.</HI></P>
<P>HERE it ought to be observed, that it is not ex∣pressed
by what authority they <HI>were put to death.</HI> Tho'
the sentences were pronounced and executed by the
Roman magistrate, (as in the case of our Saviour) <HI>Saul</HI>
might be one who <HI>gave his voice</HI> against those who
were so punished; as the people at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> did de∣mand
of <HI>Pilate,</HI> that Jesus might be crucified. It is
of some such act as this, that <HI>Saul's giving his voice
againsst them</HI> must be understood; <HI>viz.</HI> of witnessing
against them, promoting a popular clamour against
them, or of approving, and consenting to their con∣demnation
and punishment. This is all that can be in∣tended,
because whether they <HI>were put to death</HI> by the
authority of the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> or of a Roman Governour,
it cannot be supposed, that <HI>Saul</HI> was one of the judges.</P>
<P>BuT I think, it may be very well questioned, whe∣ther
in these words <HI>Paul</HI> refers to any thing, beside the
<PB N="75" REF="93"/>
death of <HI>Stephen.</HI> This is the only person whose death
he has any where expresly said he was concerned in.
There is not any one instance, beside the death of
<HI>Stephen,</HI> hinted by St. <HI>Luke:</HI> whereas, if there had
been any, 'tis very improbable, that he should have
omitted them, since he has given so particular an ac∣count
of that of <HI>Stephen.</HI> It is very common in less
exact, nay in almosst all kinds of relations, to use the
plural number, where one only is meant. Thus St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. xxvii. 44.] saies, <HI>That the thieves also
which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</HI>
Whereas, it appears from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> [Ch. xxiii. 39, 40.]
that only <HI>one of the malefactours, which were hanged,
railed on him, whilst</HI> he was rebuked by the other for
it. Again, <HI>Paul said unto them,</HI> [the keepers of the
prison at <HI>Philippi] They have beaten us openly uncondem∣ned
being</HI> ROMANS, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 37. And yet, most pro∣bably,
<HI>Paul</HI> only was a Roman, and not <HI>Silas.</HI> And
in no case could a plural number be put for a sigular
more than, properly than here, where the apostle, in his
great humility, aggravates his former blindness and
Madness. And the meaning of his words here is no
more than, when any one was put to death, I was
very forward in approving it.</P>
<P>THUS I think, that all which does evidently ap∣pear
to have been done by a proper authority of the
chief Priests and Council of the <HI>Jews,</HI> are imprison∣ment,
scourging in the Synagogue, and in some pub∣lick
place, and harrassing in such a manner, as to
oblige men to leave <HI>Judea. Stephen</HI> is put to death,
but it seems to have been in a tumultuous manner.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it must be allowed, that this was a
time of very heavy sufferings for the followers of
Jesus. And one would be apt to suppose, that for a
good part of this period, the <HI>Jews</HI> had no Roman Go∣vernour
residing among them; or if they had, that he
connived at some disorders: or else that their zeal ren∣dered
them so tumultuous, that he was not able to
keep things in good order amongst them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="94"/>
THERE is one thing very observable that for
some time before the end of this period, the disciples
of Christ enjoyed peace in <HI>Judea. Then had the churches
rest throughout all</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Galilee <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>Acts</HI>
ix. 31. I hope, we shall be able to perceive, in some
measure, the occasion of this, when we come to en∣quire
what light foreign writers give us into this time.</P>
<P>§. VIII. WE go on now to the <HI>third Period,</HI> which
is <HI>the reign of</HI> Herod <HI>the King.</HI> The account we have
of the transactions in this period is contained in the
twelfth chapter of <HI>the Acts of the Apostles;</HI> particular∣ly
from <HI>ver.</HI> I. to the 7th, and <HI>ver.</HI> 18, 19. There
being no difficulty in it, I need not transcribe it. E∣very
order and act of <HI>Herod,</HI> here mentioned, <HI>his kill∣ing</HI>
James <HI>with the sword, imprisoning Peter</HI> with in∣tent
to bring him forth to the people, <HI>commanding the
keepers to be put to death,</HI> is an undeniable proof of his
sovereign authority at this time in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>§. IX. THE <HI>fourth period</HI> reaches from the reign of
this <HI>Herod</HI> to the conclusion of the evangelical history.</P>
<P><HI>THE main thing which occurs here is the treatment
of</HI> Paul <HI>in</HI> Judea, <HI>so far as there is any appearance of
a legal procedure. He being come to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and
having been perswaded to purifie himself with others
that had a vow, entered into the temple</HI> to signifie the
accomplishment of the daies of purification,—and when the
seven, daies were almost ended, the <HI>Jews</HI> which were of
<HI>Asia,</HI> when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men and bre∣thren
help: This is the man that teacheth all men every
where against the people, and the law, and this place:
And farther, brought <HI>Greeks</HI> also into the temple, and
has polluted this holy place. (For they had seen before
with him in the City, <HI>Trophimus</HI> an <HI>Ephesian,</HI> whom
they supposed that <HI>Paul</HI> had brought into the temple) And
all the city was moved, and the people ran together, and
they took <HI>Paul</HI> and drew him out of the temple: and forth∣with
the doors were shut. And as they went about to kill
him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all
<PB N="77" REF="95"/>
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> was in an uproar. Who immediately took Sol∣diers
and Centurions, and ran down unto them, and
when they saw the chief captain, and the Soldiers, they
left beating of <HI>Paul.</HI> Then the chief captain came near,
and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two
chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had
done.—And when he could not know the certainty for
the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the, castle,
<HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 26—34.—<HI>But before he was lead, in with
the chief captain's leave, he made a speech to the peo∣ple
in the</HI> Hebrew <HI>tongue: in which he relates at length,
that he had received directions in a trance,</HI>—saying,
depart, <HI>for</HI> I will send thee far hence unto the <HI>Gentiles.
The</HI> Jews, <HI>not being able to contain themselves any
longer,</HI> lift <HI>up their voices, and said,</HI> Away with
such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he
should live, <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 22, 23. The chief Captain <HI>then</HI>
commanded that he should be brought into the castle, and
bade that he should be examined by scourging. <HI>But</HI> Paul
<HI>affirming that he was a Roman</HI> [ver. 24.] the <HI>Cen∣turion
appointed to attend the torture went and gave
the chief Captain information of it.</HI> On the morrow
because he <HI>[the chief captain]</HI> would have known the
certainty, wherefore he was accused of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he loosed
him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and
all their councel to appear, and brought <HI>Paul</HI> down and
set him before them,—30. <HI>And</HI> Paul earnestly behold∣ing
the councel, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in
all good conscience before God until this day. And the
high priest <HI>Ananias</HI> commanded them that stood by to
smite him on the mouth. Then saith <HI>Paul</HI> unto him, God
shall smite thee thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge
me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary
to the law? And they that stood by, said, Revilest thou
God's high priest? Then said <HI>Paul,</HI> I wist not, brethren,
that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. 1—5.
<HI>A dissension arising in the councel,</HI> the chief captain,
fearing left <HI>Paul</HI> should have been pulled in pieces of them,
<PB N="78" REF="96"/>
commanded the Soldiers to go down, and to take him by
force from among them, and to bring him into the castle,
<HI>ver.</HI> 9, 10.</P>
<P>THE chief captain, after this, being informed of
a conspiracy against <HI>Paul,</HI> sent him with a guard of
two hundred Soldiers to <HI>Felix</HI> at <HI>Ceserea;</HI> who, when
he had received him, together with a letter from <HI>Ly∣sias</HI>
the chief captain; told <HI>Paul</HI> he would <HI>hear him
when his accusers also were come,</HI> ver. 35. <HI>After five
daies</HI> Ananias <HI>the High Priest descended with the elders
and a certain Orator named</HI> Tertullus, <HI>who informed
the Governour against</HI> Paul.—<HI>Felix</HI> having heard both
sides <HI>deferred them, and said, when</HI> Lysias <HI>the chief
captain shall come down I will know the uttennost of your
matter,</HI> Acts xxiv. 1,—22.—But <HI>after two years,</HI>
Porcius Festus <HI>came into</HI> Felix <HI>room: and</HI> Felix <HI>willing
to shew the</HI> Jews <HI>a pleasure left</HI> Paul <HI>bound,</HI> ver. 27.</P>
<P>NOW when <HI>Festus</HI> was come into the Province, after
three daies he ascended from <HI>Cesarea</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> then
the high priest, and the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> informed him
against <HI>Paul,</HI> and besought him, and desired favour a∣gainst
him, that he would send for him to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> lay∣ing
ing in wait in the way to kill him. But <HI>Festus</HI> answered,
that <HI>Paul</HI> should be kept at <HI>Cesarea;</HI> and that he himself
would depart shortly, thither. Let them therefore, said he,
which among you are able, go down with me, and ac∣cuse
this man, if there be any wickednesse in him—<HI>accor∣dingly
—he went down to</HI> Cesarea—and sitting on the
judgment seat—the <HI>Jews</HI> which came down from <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
—laid many and grievous complaints against <HI>Paul,</HI>
which they could not prove.—Paul answered for him∣self.
—But <HI>Festus</HI> willing to do the <HI>Jews</HI> a pleasure, answered
<HI>Paul</HI> and said, Wilt thou go up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
and there be judged of these things before me? <HI>Acts</HI> xxv.
1—9. <HI>Hereupon</HI> Paul <HI>appealed to</HI> Cesar, <HI>and was
carried to</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>THE Case is this: A man was like to have been
killed in a popular tumult at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> a Roman
officer there rescues him, takes him into his own
<PB N="79" REF="97"/>
hands, and lodges him in a castle. Afterwards, that
his prisoner might be safer, he removes him to <HI>Cesa∣rea,</HI>
the residence of the Governour, before whom
there are divers hearings. There was therefore at this
time a Roman Governour in <HI>Judea,</HI> at first <HI>Felix,</HI>
who was succeeded by <HI>Festus.</HI> But beside them here
is also a <HI>Jewish</HI> councel, which appears not void of
authority.</P>
<P>THIS is the sum of the story. But here are di∣vers
particulars to be reviewed. The pretense for
seising this man at first is extremely complicated.
<HI>That he taught men every where against the people, and
the law, and this place, and had brought</HI> Greeks <HI>into the
temple and polluted this holy place.</HI> The whole charge
however seems to have been of a religious nature.
This appears from divers testimonies.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Paul</HI> was brought before the council at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> by <HI>Lysias,</HI> he <HI>said, I am</HI> a pharisee, <HI>the son
of a</HI> pharisee: <HI>of the hope and resurrection of the dead
am</HI> I <HI>called in question,</HI> Acts xxiii. 6. This is a pre∣sumption,
the debates then ran upon matters of reli∣gion.
<HI>Lysias,</HI> in the letter he sent with <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Felix,</HI>
says:—<HI>I brought him forth into their councel, whom I
perceived to be accused of questions of their law,</HI> v. 28, 29.
<HI>Tertullus,</HI> whom <HI>Ananias</HI> took along with him to <HI>Cesa∣rea,</HI>
tells <HI>Felix: We have found this man a pestilent fel∣low,
and a mover of sedition among all the</HI> Jews <HI>through∣out
the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the</HI> Naza∣renes,
<HI>who also hath gone about to profane the temple,</HI>
Ch. xxiv. 5, 6. Here are hard words, and some grie∣vous
charges thrown in to encrease the account; and
nothing true, but that <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Nazarene,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI>
affirms, and seems to make out to <HI>Felix. And they
neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
neither raising up the people, neither in the Synagogue,
nor in the city: neither can they prove the things whereof
they accuse me. But this I confesse to thee, that after the
way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my
fathers,</HI> ver. 12—14. <HI>And after certain daies, when</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="98"/>
Felix <HI>came with his wife</HI> Drusilla, <HI>he sent for</HI> Paul,
<HI>and heard him concerning the faith in Christ,</HI>—24,
These new notions therefore of <HI>Paul</HI> were the great
subject of enquiry, to' see whether there was any thing
dangerous or punishable in them.</P>
<P>THUS, before <HI>Festus</HI> at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> which
were come down from <HI>Jerusalem, laid many and grie∣vous
complaints against</HI> Paul <HI>which they could not prove,</HI>
Acts xxv. 7. When <HI>Agrippa</HI> came to salute <HI>Festus,
Festus</HI> declared <HI>Paul's cause unto the king,</HI> and tells
him; <HI>Against whom, when the accusers flood up, they
brought none accusation of such things as I supposed; but
had certain questions against him of their own Supersti∣tion,
and of one Jesus which was dead, whom</HI> Paul <HI>af∣firmed
to be alive,</HI>—20. They might mix other mat∣ters
in their complaints, as men intent upon a point
are wont to do; but <HI>Festus</HI> perceived no truth in
their charges, but what concerned their <HI>Superstition,</HI>
or religion. <HI>Festus</HI> afterwards brings forth <HI>Paul</HI> to
<HI>Agrippa:</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> having rehearsed the manner of
his life from first to last, before, and since his conver∣sion
and having acquainted them in particular with
his commission from Christ to preach the gospel; af∣ter
all was over, <HI>Agrippa</HI> said unto <HI>Festus, This man
might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto
Cesar,</HI> Acts xxvi. 15—30. Which words shew, <HI>A∣grippa</HI>
was convinced by what <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>first,</HI> that
these principles of his were his only crime; and <HI>second∣ly,</HI>
that notwithstanding the charges and pretenses of
the <HI>Jews, Festus</HI> had a right to set <HI>Paul</HI> at liberty.</P>
<P>FROM all which particulars it appears, that all
the evidence against <HI>Paul</HI> was of facts that concerned
the <HI>Jewish</HI> religion, or the security of their worship;
and yet we find, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Feftus</HI> were the judges
of this prisoner, in this cause: all parties acknow∣ledge
it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> seem to have owned it by their conduct:
for <HI>Ananias</HI> went down to <HI>Cesarea</HI> with <HI>Tertullus,</HI> and
accused <HI>Paul</HI> there before <HI>Felix.</HI> And when <HI>Festus</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="99"/>
came into the province, they went to <HI>Cesarea</HI> again,
and pleaded against <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts xxv. 6, 7. <HI>Festus,</HI>
speaking of Paul to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> says, about whom <HI>when
I mas at</HI> Jerusalem <HI>the chief priests and the elders of the</HI>
Jews <HI>informed me, desiring to have judgment against him,</HI>
ver. 15. And again, <HI>Ye see this man, about whom all
the multitude of the</HI> Jews <HI>have dealt with me, both at</HI>
Jerusalem, <HI>and also here, crying, that he ought not to
live any longer,</HI> ver. 24.</P>
<P><HI>PAUL</HI> plainly acknowledges them to be so.
<HI>Then</HI> Paul, <HI>after that the Governour had beckned to him,
to speak, answered for himself: Forasmuch as I know
that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this na∣tion,
I do the more chearfully answer for my self,</HI> Ch.
xxiv. 10 And that his cause belonged to the Roman
jurisdiction, he declared farther by his appeal at last
to <HI>Cesar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THESE Governours evidently claim the right of
judgment. When</HI> Paul <HI>was first delivered to</HI> Felix <HI>at</HI>
Cesarea, Felix <HI>said to him,</HI> I will hear thee when thine
accusers also are come, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiii. 35. <HI>And after he had
heard the accusers and</HI> Paul <HI>the prisoner in judgment,</HI>
he deferred them, and said, When <HI>Lysias</HI> the chief cap∣tain
shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your
matter, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiv. 22. <HI>When</HI> Festus <HI>went first to</HI> Jeru∣salem,
<HI>after he came into the province,</HI> the high priest
and chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> desired favour against him [<HI>Paul</HI>]
that he would send for him to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But <HI>Festus</HI> an∣swered,
that <HI>Paul</HI> should be kept at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> and that he
him self would depart shortly thither. Let them therefore,
said he, which among you are able, go down with me,
and accuse this man, if there be any wickednesse in him,
<HI>Ch.</HI> xxv. 2, 5. Paul <HI>having pleaded there before him,</HI>
Festus willing to do the <HI>Jews</HI> a pleasure, answered <HI>Paul,</HI>
and said, wilt thou go up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and there be
judged of these things <HI>BEFORE ME?</HI>—9.</P>
<P>IT ought to be observed likewise, that the <HI>Jews</HI> are
all along stiled. <HI>accusers</HI> only: the places are too many
<PB N="82" REF="100"/>
to be instanced in, and the reader cannot but reco∣lect
divers of them.</P>
<P>§. X. BUT though this affair, thus stated, favours
much the Supposition, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had not now the
power of life and death; yet there are some difficul∣ties
that deserve consideration.</P>
<P>I. IT may be thought, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had at this
time the power of life and death, according to the
constitution they were then under, but that <HI>Lysias</HI> had
acted irregularly in taking <HI>Paul</HI> out of the <HI>jewish</HI> hands,
and that the Governours likewise acted arbitrarily in
supporting <HI>Lysias.</HI> This objection is founded upon
what <HI>Tertullus</HI> says to <HI>Felix</HI> in his pleading before him:
<HI>For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a
ringleader of the sect of the</HI> Nazarenes, <HI>who also has gone
about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would
have judged according to our law. But the chief captain</HI>
Lysias <HI>came upon us, and with great violence took him out
of our hands,</HI> Acts xxiv. 5—7.</P>
<P>IN answer to this: It is not easy to say, what we
ought to understand by these words, whom <HI>we would
have judged according to our law.</HI> Perhaps he may be
supposed by some to say, that <HI>Paul</HI> having, beside
other crimes, polluted the temple by bringing Hea∣then
and uncircumcised persons into it, or beyond the
bounds which were prescribed to such, we were go∣ing
for this last offense to put him to death immedi∣ately
<HI>Titus</HI> in an expostulatory speech to the <HI>Jews,</HI>
toward the conclusion of the Siege of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> says,
“Did not you erect pillars there at certain distances,
with inscriptions in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> forbidding any
to pass those bounds? And did not we give you
leave to kill any man that passed them, tho' he
were a Roman<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. de Bell. lib. 6. c. ii. §. 4.</NOTE>?” But though it could be sup∣posed,
that here was some reference to this matter;
yet certainly they had no right by virtue of this per∣mission,
<PB N="83" REF="101"/>
to put <HI>Paul</HI> to death. This grant only em∣powered
them to kill strangers that passed those limits:
whereas <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Jew.</HI> So that they acted irregu∣larly
in attempting to kill him upon this account.</P>
<P>BUT possibly this man here attempted to misrepre∣sent
the fact, and pretended, that they were not go∣ing
to kill <HI>Paul,</HI> but only to inflict one of those lesser
punishments for the breach of their laws, which they
had a right to inflict. And indeed I think, there is
but little regard to be had to what <HI>Tertullus</HI> says. It
seems plain to me, that he endeavours to impose upon
the Governour. Their attempt upon <HI>Paul</HI> was a meer
tumult, as appears from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s history of it, <HI>Acts</HI>
xxi. 27—31. And if we had not any particular ac∣count
of that first action of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> yet
<HI>Paul</HI> confuted, or invalidated all this part of <HI>Tertul∣lus's</HI>
speech by that one observation in his defense and
reply: <HI>Whereupon certain</HI> Jews <HI>from</HI> Asia <HI>found me pu∣rified
in the temple, neither with multitude nor with tu∣mult:
who ought to have been here before thee, and ob∣ject,
if they had ought against me,</HI> Chap. xxiv. 18, 19.
The non-appearance of these persons is a proof, that
what they had done was not legal, and could not be
justified: and doubtless <HI>Felix</HI> so understood it.</P>
<P>As for the charge which <HI>Tertullus</HI> brings against
<HI>Lysias, that he came upon us, and with great violence
took him out of our hands;</HI> this is undoubtedly of a
piece with what went before. He that could call that
tumultuous attempt upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s life, <HI>judging him ac∣cording
to their law,</HI> might say any thing. <HI>Lysias</HI> su∣stains
so excellent a character in every other part of this
narration, that it is not easy to suppose, he had acted
irregularly in this action. He paid such a regard to
the disposition of the <HI>Jewish</HI> people against <HI>Paul,</HI> as
to bind him with two chains, as soon as he had got
him into his possession. Not being able to find the
truth from the different accounts given him, he ordered
<HI>Paul</HI> to be examined by scourging. As soon as he
knew that he was a Roman, he desisted from that me∣thod
<PB N="84" REF="102"/>
of enquiry. That he might know the certainty
he summoned a council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI>
down to them, and had the goodnesse to unbind him
whilst he pleaded. As soon as he was informed of a
clandestine conspiracy against <HI>Paul,</HI> he prudently con∣trives
to send him under a strong guard to <HI>Cesarea,</HI>
where he might be safe. In his letter to <HI>Felix</HI> he gives
a most just account of the whole affair, and of his
own conduct in particular. <HI>This man was taken of the</HI>
Jews, <HI>and should have been killed by them: then came I
with an army and rescued him.</HI> And though I pass by
many advantageous parts of his character, I must not
omit his goodnesse, or exactnesse at lest, in not con∣signing
this prisoner to <HI>Felix</HI> without adding, beside his
innocence, that he was a <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things are sufficient to assure us, that <HI>Ly∣sias</HI>
had a strict regard to justice, and the form of go∣vernment
then established in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that, in re∣scuing
<HI>Paul</HI> from a mob, he had acted nothing but the
part of a faithful and vigilant Commander.</P>
<P>2. FARTHER, those words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> may create
some difficulty, which we have in his answer to <HI>Festus</HI>'s
proposal of his going to be judged at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>—
<HI>But if there be none of these things whereof these accuse
me, no man may</HI> DELIVER ME <HI>unto them:</HI> Acts XXV. II.
Whereby some may apprehend, that <HI>Paul</HI> was afraid,
<HI>Festus</HI> would give the Cause out of his own hands; and
permit the <HI>Jewish</HI> Council to try him for his life.</P>
<P>BUT this cannot be the intention of <HI>Paul.</HI> For
<HI>Festus</HI>'s proposal was: <HI>Wilt thou go up to</HI> Jerusalem,
<HI>and there be judged of these things</HI> BEFORE ME?</P>
<P>NOR secondly, is this the meaning of this phrase,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> The meaning is, no
man may condemn me to death to please the <HI>Jews.
Paul</HI> was afraid, that if he was carried up to <HI>Jerusa∣lem,
Festus</HI> might be induced by the whole weight of
the <HI>Jewish</HI> people there, to condemn him, though in∣nocent.
This is die common meaning of this word in
like cases; when a judge is induced to depart from
<PB N="85" REF="103"/>
the merits of a cause, or from his own judgment, and
to pronounce a sentence to gratify other people. It is
used in a good, and in a bad sense. It is used in a good
sense by <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus,</HI> who says: <HI>Amulius</HI>
gave (or delivered) <HI>Rhea Silvia</HI> to his daughter: that
is, granted <HI>Rhea</HI> her life at the request of his daugh∣ter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. p. 63. V. 14. edit. Huds</NOTE>
And by <HI>Josephus;</HI> for thus he addresses him∣self
to <HI>Justus</HI> of <HI>Tiberias:</HI> “And did not <HI>Agrippa,</HI>
when he had ordered you to be put to death, grant
[or deliver] your life to his Sister <HI>Bernice</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. in Vit. Cap. 65. p. 839. v. I. <HI>It is used by him in a good Sense again:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. lib, 3. cap. ult. sub sin.</NOTE> when
she earnestly requested it?”</P>
<P>IT is also used in a bad sense. Thus the <HI>Jewish</HI>
embassadours, in the complaints they made to <HI>Augu∣stus</HI>
at <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's government, after
his death, say, “He gave (or <HI>delivered</HI>) the blood
of <HI>Judea</HI> to foreign people<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. lib. 2 cap. 6. §. 2. jam citat. a Grot. in loc I subjoin a beau∣tiful Sentence of <HI>Socrates</HI> in <HI>Plato,</HI> in which he says: Nor is a judge appointed to give away right and justice to favour, or intreaty, but to judge according to the laws. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Apol. Socr. P. 35. c. edit. Serran.</NOTE>.” This therefore is
what <HI>Paul</HI> says, that since he was innocent, no man
might condemn him to please others, no not a whole
nation.</P>
<P>3. STILL some may have a suspicion, that if this
was not a cause within the jurisdiction of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
the reason might be, that the prisoner concerned was
a Roman Citizen: and they may think, such a suspi∣cion
may be founded upon what <HI>Lysias</HI> says in his letter
to <HI>Felix: This man was taken of the</HI> Jews, <HI>and should
<PB N="86" REF="104"/>
have been killed of them: then came I with an army,
and rescued him,</HI> HAVING UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS
A ROMAN, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiii. 27.</P>
<P>IN answer to this: some learned men place a full
point after <HI>rescued him.</HI> And join these last words,
not with what goes before them, but with what fol∣lows,
and translate them thus: Having understood
that he was a Roman Citizen, and being desirous to
know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought
him forth to the Council<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ayant apris qu'il est citoyen Romain, &amp; voulant savoir quel étoit le crime, dont ils l' accusoient, je l' avois mené devant leur Sanhedrim. Nouv: Testament traduit par Mr. <HI>Le Clerc.</HI></NOTE> But the original will
not admit of this interpretation<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">For then the words would have been <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Whereas they are—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. I think, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> following <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Mr. <HI>Le Clerc</HI>'s interpretaion is not just.</NOTE></P>
<P>I answer therefore, that this cannot be the mean∣ing
of <HI>Lysias,</HI> that having understood he was a Ro∣man,
he then came upon them and rescued him; be∣cause
this was not the fact, as St. <HI>Luke</HI> himself, who
has given us this letter, relates it. <HI>Lysias</HI> did not
know that <HI>Paul</HI> was a Roman, till after he had put
him into the castle, and ordered him to be there exa∣mined
by scourging, <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 26, 27. Nor do the
words themselves necessarily imply, that he knew this,
before he had taken him out of the <HI>Jewish</HI> hands.
They import no more than this, as <HI>Grotius</HI> has obser∣ved:
then came I with an army and rescued him, and
I have understood that he is a Roman<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Aoristus hie nullum certum tempus designat: &amp; tantrum valet quantum <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (&amp; cognoveram) Grot, in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND it appears to me very observable, that in the
course of this long affair in <HI>Judea</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> has never
insisted upon the privilege of a citizen, but in that one
case, of the chief captain's ordering him to be exa∣mined
by scourging.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, if any are inclined to suspect that
<HI>Paul</HI>'s being a Roman Citizen might exempt him
<PB N="87" REF="105"/>
from the jurisdiction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> then this particular
case must be set aside; and we have in it no proof,
one way or other, what was the power of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
councel over their own people in their own country.</P>
<P>BUT though we set aside all the proceedings rela∣ting
to <HI>Paul;</HI> after he was known to be a Roman Ci∣tizen;
yet it seems to me, that we have some particu∣lars
mentioned in this narration, which shew the <HI>Jew∣ish</HI>
magistrates had not the supreme government in <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
no not in religious matters.</P>
<P>THE rescue of <HI>Paul</HI> by <HI>Lysias</HI> is one part of this
Story. The <HI>Jews</HI> were about to kill him. <HI>The chief
captain hearing of the uproar immediately took Soldiers
and Centurions, and ran down to them.—Then the chief
captain came near and took him.</HI> He did not then know
who, or what <HI>Paul</HI> was: he might have been a mere
<HI>Jew,</HI> for ought he knew, <HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 31—38.</P>
<P>AND I think that <HI>Paul</HI>'s defense before <HI>Felix,</HI> in
answer to <HI>Tertullus,</HI> is remarkable: <HI>Forasmuch as I
know, that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this
nation, I do the more chearfully answer for myself,</HI> Acts
xxiv. 10. This argument had been ridiculous, if such
cases as these had never come before <HI>Felix,</HI> and did
not belong to him. All the particulars insisted on from
<HI>ver.</HI> 11. to 21. have some regard to religion and the
security of it. <HI>They neither found me in the temple dispu∣ting
with any man.—Felix</HI> was a Judge unto this nation
in these causes. Nor does <HI>Paul</HI> speak of himself as a
<HI>Roman,</HI> but as a <HI>Jew. Now after many years I came
to bring alms to my nation, and offerings,</HI> ver. 17.</P>
<P>AND if all this do not amount to a proof, that
causes of a religious nature belonged to the Roman ju∣risdiction;
yet certainly, here is sufficient to prove
that the Romans had supreme power over the <HI>Jews</HI> in
civil matters: or else, they had no power at all. For
I presume, no man will suppose, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus</HI>
were sent to govern <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> only in <HI>Judea.</HI>
I need not remind the reader of all the particulars that
have already passed before us. But he cannot forget the
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
acknowledgment St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes of <HI>Felix</HI> being <HI>judge
unto that nation,</HI> nor the Roman Garrison at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
nor the title of <HI>Governour</HI> given to <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus,</HI>
nor what <HI>Tertullus</HI> says: <HI>Seeing that by thee we enjoy
great quietnesse, and that very worthy deeds are done un∣to
this nation by thy providence, we accept it always, most
noble</HI> Felix, <HI>with all thankfulnesse,</HI> Ch. xxiv. 23. And
of <HI>Lysias,</HI> an officer plainly interior to <HI>Felix,</HI> it is said,
that, <HI>because he would have known the certainty, where∣fore
he</HI> [Paul] <HI>was</HI> ACCUSED OF THE JEWS, HE COM∣MANDED
THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ALL THEIR COUN∣SEL
TO APPEAR, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 30.</P>
<P>THIS is what we can collect from the sacred wri∣ters,
concerning <HI>the state of Judea,</HI> at the time of
their history.</P>
<P>§. XI. I proceed now to shew their agreement with
other ancient writers. The first and last periods are
evidently of the same kind: and therefore I shall en∣deavour
jointly to confirm what we have met with
concerning them.</P>
<P>DURING the whole first period, <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was
Governour of <HI>Judea:</HI> And all we have taken notice
of in the fourth, or last period, happened under <HI>Felix,</HI>
or <HI>Porcius Festus,</HI> likewise Roman Governours of <HI>Ju∣dea.</HI>
That <HI>Judea</HI> was, at the times the Evangelists
speak of, under the government of these Roman offi∣cers,
has been shewn already, or will be shewn in o∣ther
parts of this work. This being taken for grant∣ed,
we are now only to enquire, whether the Evange∣lists
appear to have had a just idea of the power, which
these Governours had in this country.</P>
<P>IN order to determine this, I shall</P>
<P>1. SET down the opinions of divers Roman Law∣yers
concerning the power of the Presidents of pro∣vinces.</P>
<P>2. I shall give some passages of ancient writers rela∣ting
to the state of <HI>Judea</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>3. SOME passages of ancient writers concerning the
state of people in other provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="107"/>
1. I shall set down the opinions of divers Roman
Lawyers concerning the power of the Presidents of
provinces</P>
<P><HI>ULPIAN,</HI> who flourished in the very begin∣ning
of the third century of the Christian <HI>Aera,</HI> says:
“It is the duty of a good and vigilant President to
see to it, that his province be peaceable and quiet.—
And that he ought to make diligent search after
sacrilegious persons, robbers, men-stealers, and
thieves: and to punish every one according to his
guilt<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Congruit bono &amp; gravi Praesidi curare, ut pacata atque quieta provincia sit, quam regit:—Nam &amp; sacrilegos, latrones, plagiari∣os, fures conquirere debet: &amp; prout quisque deliquerit, in eum animadvertere. L. 13. pr. ff. de off. Praes.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE same celebrated Lawyer says: “They who
govern whole provinces have the right of thesword,
and the power of sending to the mines<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Qui universas provincias regunt, jus gladii habent: &amp; in me∣tallum dandi potestas eis permissa est. L. 6. §. 8. ff. eod.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AND the right of the sword, or power of the sword
appears from another passage of the same <HI>Lawyer</HI> to
be the power of punishing malefactors<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Imperium aut merum [est] aut mixtum est. Merum est im∣perium, habere gladii potestatem ad animadvertendos facinorosos homines, quod etiam potestas appellatur. Mixtum est imperium, cui etiam jurisdictio inest, quod in <HI>danda bonorum</HI> possessione consi∣stit. L. 3. ff. de Jurisd.</NOTE></P>
<P>AGAIN, he says: “The President of a province
hath the highest authority in his province next to
the Emperour<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Praeses provinciae majus imperium in ea provincia habet om∣nibus post principem. 1. 4. ff. de Off. Praes.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>HERMOGENIANUS</HI> says: “Governours
and Presidents of provinces have the cognisance of
all causes, which belong to the Prefect of the City,
or the Prefect of the Praetorium, and the Consuls,
and Praetors, and other magistrates at <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ex omnibus causis, de quibus vel Praefectus Urbi, vel Prae∣fectus praetorio, itemque Consules &amp; Praetores, caeterique Romae cognoscunt, Correctorum &amp; Praesidun provinciarum est notio. L. 10, ff. eod.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="108"/>
AND <HI>Marcianus:</HI> “All affairs In the provinces,
which at <HI>Rome</HI> are under the jurisdiction of several
judges, do belong to the Presidents<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Omnia enim provincialia desideria, quae Romae varios judices habent, ad officium Praesidum pertinent. L. 11. ff. eod.

L. 12. eod.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>ULPIAN</HI> says: “No one can transfer to ano∣ther
the power of the sword which has been com∣mitted
to himself, nor the right of any other pu∣nishment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Solent etiam custodiarum cognitionem mandare Legatis: sci∣licet, ut praeauditas custodias ad se remittant, ut innocentem libe∣ret: Sed hoc genus mandati extraordinarium est: nee enim potest quis gladii potestatem sibi datam, vel cujus alterius coercitionis ad alium transferre. L. 6. pr. ff. de Officio Proconsulis &amp; Legati. Papinianus <HI>say the same thing,</HI> Qui mandatam jurisdictionem sus∣eepit, proprium nihil habet: Sed [&amp;] ejus, qui mandavit, juris∣dictione utitur.

L. I. §. I. ff. de Officio ejus cui man∣dat. est Jurisd.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>MARCIANUS</HI> says: “<HI>Adrian</HI> wrote thus to
<HI>Julius Secunaus: It has been already enjoined by Re∣scripts,
that credit is not to be given to the epistles of
those, who send persons to the Presidents as condemned,</HI>
The same rule extends to the peace-officers.—
Therefore they who are sent with a Bill [or <HI>infor∣mation]</HI>
are to be re-heard, although they are sent
with a Letter, or are brought by the Pcace-of∣ficers<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Divus Hadrianus Julio Secundo ita rescripsit: <HI>Et alias rescrip∣tum est, non esse utique epistolis eorum credendum, qui quasI damnatos ad Praefidem remiserint.</HI> Idem de Irenarchis praeceptum est: quia non omnes ex fide bona elogia scribere compertum est,—Igitur, qui cum elogio mittuntur, ex integro audiendi sunt, etsti per literas missi suerint, vel etiam per Irenarchas perducti.

<P>THIS illustrates several particulars in the causes we

the <HI>Jewish</HI> council upon their examination of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
pronounced him to be <HI>guilty of death,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 66.

a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto

hearing: and did not at all relie upon the information
of the Council. And <HI>Paul</HI> was heard again before
<HI>Felix,</HI> though <HI>Lysias</HI> sent him with a Letter, in which
he informed the Governour of his innocence. Nor did
<HI>Lysias</HI> expect, that <HI>Felix</HI> should relie upon the hearing
he had given the cause, and the sentence he gave con∣cerning
it; but referred the issue to <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ULPIAN</HI> says: “The magistrates of muni∣cipal
places may not punish a Slave (with death):
but the inflicting lesser penalties is not to be denied
them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Magistratibus municipalibus supplicium a servo sumere non li∣cet: modica autem castigatio non est deneganda.

<HI>ARCHELAUS, Herod's</HI> Son, being banished
by <HI>Augustus,</HI> A. D. 6 or 7, <HI>Judea</HI> was put under the
Government of Roman officers sent from <HI>Rome.</HI> Of
this affair <HI>Josephus,</HI> in the <HI>Jewish war,</HI> speaks in these
words: “The Dominion of <HI>Archelaus</HI> being reduced
to a province, <HI>Coponius</HI> a person of the <HI>Equestrian</HI>
order among the Romans, is sent thither, invested
by <HI>Cesar</HI> with the power of life and death<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Jos. de B. Lib. ii. cap. viii. §. I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>SPEAKING of this same revolution in his <HI>Antiqui∣ties,</HI>
he saies; “in the mean time <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> a Senator
—came into <HI>Syria</HI>—being sent thither by <HI>Cesar,</HI> as
judge of that nation, and Censor of their estates,
And <HI>Coponius,</HI> a person of the <HI>Equestrian</HI> rank, is
sent with him, to govern the <HI>Jews</HI> with supreme au∣thority:

annexed to the province of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. L. 18. cap. I. § I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHEN St. <HI>Luke</HI> mentions <HI>Festus's</HI> arrival into the
<HI>Province</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> namely of <HI>Judea</HI> Acts xxv. I. He uses
the same word, that <HI>Josephus</HI> does, when he saies, that
<HI>Archelaus</HI>'s dominion was reduced to a <HI>Province.</HI> And
when St. <HI>Paul</HI> stiles <HI>Felix</HI> the <HI>Judge</HI> unto that nati∣on
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 10.</NOTE> he uses a phrase equivalent to that, by which
<HI>Josephas</HI> describes the authority, with which <HI>Cyrenius</HI>
was sent into <HI>Syria,</HI> viz. <HI>as Judge of that people,</HI> or to
administer justice among them.</P>
<P>As <HI>Cyrenius</HI> came at this time into <HI>Judea,</HI> and
made an assessement there, so the <HI>Jews</HI> continued,
whilst a Roman province, to pay tribute to the Em∣perour.
<HI>Tacitus</HI> informs us, that in the third of <HI>Tibe∣rius,</HI>
A. D. 17. The <HI>Jews</HI> presented a petition to
<PB N="93" REF="111"/>
<HI>Tiberius</HI> for an abatement of their tribute<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Et provinciae Syria atque Judaea fessae oneribus, diminutio∣nem tributi orabant. Ann. lib. z. cap. 42.</NOTE> And
<HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger, A. D. 66. tells the <HI>Jews,</HI> that
the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> paid the Romans more tribute in a

<P><HI>PHILO</HI> has given a long representation of <HI>Pi∣late</HI>'s
government, in the complaints which the <HI>Jews</HI>
made to <HI>Pilate</HI> upon his dedicating Shields at <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI>
They tell him, “It was not the will of <HI>Tiberius</HI>
that any of their laws and customs should be vio∣lated
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Philo de legat. ad Cai. p. 1034. B.</NOTE> And <HI>Pilate</HI> was afraid that if they should
send an Embassy to <HI>Rome,</HI> they would discover to
the Emperour the many crimes of his administra∣tion,
his taking of bribes, his extortions, his mur∣ders
of innocent and uncondemned persons, and
other cruelties<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>id. ibid. C.</NOTE>.” Here are the tokens of civil
power, but much abused.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Josephus</HI> there are many instances of the autho∣rity
of <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus,</HI> who punished not only bands
of robbers, but those also that got together under re∣ligious
pretenses, though with designs of making in∣novations
in the government<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Antiq. lib. xx. cap. vii. §. 6. 10. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 13</NOTE> And these facts <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
relates without any marks of censure; whereas,
when these, or any other of the Governours commit∣ted
any acts of violence and injustice, he never fails to
make reflexions upon them.</P>
<P>I shall transcribe here but one passage concerning
an action of <HI>Albinus,</HI> Successor of <HI>Porcius Festus,</HI>
just before he left the province. “But when <HI>Albi∣nus</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="112"/>
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 20. cap. 8. §. 5.</NOTE> heard that <HI>Gessius Florus</HI> was coming to
succeed him, being desirous to seem to do some∣thing
to gratifie the people of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> having
enquired into the case of all that were in prison,
he gave orders for the putting to death all that
were manifestly guilty of capital crimes: But set
at liberty all those who had been imprisoned for
lesser offenses, having first received a sum of mo∣ney.
Thus the prisons were emptied, and the
country was filled with robbers.” This is a proof,
that <HI>Albinus</HI> had the supreme power in all offenses.
These must be <HI>jewish</HI> prisoners, or the releasing them
had been no obligation upon the people of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though these Procurators acted with the high∣est
authority under the Emperour, yet the <HI>Jews</HI> had
a Senate and Magistrates; as appears undeniably from
a Letter of <HI>Claudius,</HI> sent to them in answer to a peti∣tion
he had received from them; which letter was
writ A. D. 45. and is thus directed: “To the ma∣gistrates
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the Council, the People,
and the whole nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> greeting<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. L. 20. cap. i. §. 2.</NOTE>”
<HI>Josephus</HI> often makes mention of the magistrates and
chief men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>p. 1073. 28. &amp; alibi passim.</NOTE> When the War was just
breaking out between them and the <HI>Romans,</HI> they
being very uneasy under the government of their Pro∣curator
<HI>Florus, Josephus</HI> says, that the “High
Priests of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the chief men, and the
COUNCIL waited upon <HI>Agrippa</HI> to inform him of
the state of their affairs<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>de Bell. L. ii. cap. 16. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="113"/>
WE have a proof of their power of <HI>beating</HI> or <HI>whip∣ping,</HI>
in the punishment of <HI>Jesus</HI> the Son of <HI>Ananus,</HI>
who at the feast of Tabernacles, four years before the
war, began his lamentable crie: “A voice against
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> A voice against the Temple.—He went
through all the streets of the city crying thus day
and night.—Some of the chief of the people be∣ing
uneasie at so ill boding a found take the man up
and have him beaten most severely.”—But he still
continuing his cry; “The magistrates thinking the
man must be under some more than ordinary im∣pulse,
as indeed he was, bring him to the Roman
president.—He having examined and whip'd him
again, dismissed him as a mad man<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">de. B. J. lib. 6. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS shews the magistrates of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> could
order a whipping: but whether their carrying the
man after that to the Roman Procurator amounts to
a proof, that they could not inflict any heavier punish∣ment,
I must leave to the reader's consideration.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> had likewise Senates in some other cities
beside <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which Senates had also the power of
imprisoning. <HI>Josephus</HI> thus characterizes <HI>Albinus</HI>'s go∣vernment.
“For sums of money paid by relations,
he set at liberty thieves and robbers, which had
been imprisoned by the Senate of any place, or by
the former Procurators<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De bell. lib. ii. cap. 14. §. I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AND now I reckon we have gone over the several
instances of the <HI>Jews</HI> power and authority. The na∣ture
of the Roman government in <HI>Judea,</HI> and the ex∣tent
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> privileges under that government
<PB N="96" REF="114"/>
may however be farther illustrated from two or three
other passages. When <HI>Herod</HI> the Great was dead, the
<HI>Jews</HI> having been oppressed by him, and being desi∣rous
to be no longer subject to any of his family, lent
an Ambassy to <HI>Augustus.</HI> The substance of their pe∣tition
presented to the Emperour, <HI>Josephus</HI> says, was
this; “That they might no longer continue in the
state of a kingdom, but might be annexed to <HI>Sy∣ria,</HI>
and be governed by Praetors sent from
thence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. lib. 17. cap. 13. §. I.</NOTE>.” Thus he represents it in his <HI>Antiqui∣ties.</HI> In his <HI>Jewish</HI> War he expresses it thus: “Am∣bassadors
were sent away to obtain a right of liv∣ing
according to their own laws<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 6. §. I.</NOTE>.” These two
passages laid together assure us, their petition was,
That they might be governed by Roman officers ac∣cording
to their own laws.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Josepbus</HI> says, that after the death of <HI>Herod
Agrippa, “Claudius</HI> made <HI>Judea</HI> a province again,
and sent <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI> to be Procurator, and after∣wards
<HI>Tiberius Alexander.</HI> They MAKING NO AL∣TERATIONS
IN THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE
COUNTRY, kept the nation in peace<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De Bell. lib. ii. cap. xi. §. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is likewise worth while to place here a part of
the Speech, which <HI>Agrippa the Younger</HI> made to the
people at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to disswade them from entering
into war with the Romans. “I know very well, <HI>says
he,</HI> that many make loud complaints of the oppres∣sions
of the Procurators, and run out into the
praises of Liberty. Before I come therefore to
consider the prospect of successe in this your de∣sign,
by shewing you what is your strength, and
<PB N="97" REF="115"/>
what is theirs with whom you are about to contend;
I would first distinguish the pretenses, which are
strangely connected by some. For if you would re∣venge
those who do you wrong, why do you talk of
liberty? But if you judge servitude intolerable, com∣plaints
of the Governours are superfluous. For tho'
they be ever so just and moderate in their govern∣ment,
the scandal of subjection (or servitude) re∣mains
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De B. J. lib. 2. cap. 16. §. 4.</NOTE>.” This is a proof, that whilst they had a
Roman Governour in their country, no sober men
among them would pretend they were a free people.</P>
<P>AND it is a kind of presumption, that the <HI>Jews</HI>
had not at this time the power of life and death, in
that, in all <HI>Josephus</HI>'s history of these times, when cri∣minals
abounded in <HI>Judea,</HI> and many were put to
death by the Roman Governours; we find not the
mention of any one put to death by the <HI>Jewish</HI> coun∣cil
or magistracy, except those which were stoned in
a vacancy between the death of <HI>Festus,</HI> (which hap∣pened
in the province) and the arrival of <HI>Albinus</HI> his
Successor.</P>
<P>THE case is remarkable, and some readers may be
willing to see it here. “<HI>Ananus</HI> the younger, who
we said just now had been put into the priesthood,
was fierce and haughty in his behaviour, and ex∣tremely
resolute and daring: And moreover was
of the sect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who are, above all
other <HI>Jews,</HI> cruel in their judicial sentences. This
then being the temper of <HI>Ananus,</HI> he thinking he
had a fit opportunity, because <HI>Festus</HI> was dead,
and <HI>Albinus</HI> was yet upon the road, calls a council:
and bringing before them <HI>James,</HI> the brother of
him who is called Christ, and some others, he ac∣cused
<PB N="98" REF="116"/>
cused them as transgressors of the laws, and had
them stoned to death<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 20. cap. 8. §. I.</NOTE>.” <HI>Josephus</HI> says, many
were offended at this proceeding. “And some went
away to meet <HI>Albinus</HI> who was coming from <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI>
and put<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid.</NOTE> him in mind that <HI>Ananus</HI> had no
right to call a council without his leave. <HI>Albinus</HI>
approving of what they said, wrote a very angry
letter to <HI>Ananus</HI> threatening to punish him for what
he had done. And king <HI>Agrippa</HI> took away from
him the priesthood, after he had enjoyed it three
months, and put in <HI>Jesus</HI> the Son of <HI>Damnaeus.</HI>”</P>
<P>SOME learned men have suspected those words, <HI>the
brother of him who is called Christ,</HI> to be an interpola∣tion.
But we have no occasion at present to concern
ourselves with that. It is certain, here were some men
put to death by the procurement of the High Priest
and the council he summoned; and the action was
judged illegal by many at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by <HI>Albinus</HI> the
Procurator, and by <HI>Agrippa,</HI> who had then the go∣vernment
of the temple, and the right of nominating
the High Priests. Nay, <HI>Ananus</HI> had not the right of
summoning the Council without <HI>Albinus</HI>'s leave. And
I think, that <HI>Josephus</HI>'s introduction to this story is a
proof, that the Council had not the power of life and
death under a Roman Procurator. <HI>Ananus</HI> was of the
sect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who were cruel in their sentences
above all other <HI>Jews. Ananus</HI> was of the same temper.
<HI>Festus</HI> being dead, and <HI>Albinus</HI> yet upon the road, <HI>Ana∣nus</HI>
thought he had a fit opportunity to gratify his cruel
<PB N="99" REF="117"/>
disposition, and calls a council in order to have some
men stoned to death. It is herein implied, that even
this <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>daring</HI> High Priest could not have grati∣fied
his cruelty in this way, if a Procurator had been
in the country. And though he thought lie had had
a <HI>fit opportunity,</HI> what he did then cost him the priest∣hood.</P>
<P>THERE was likewise a sort of council summoned
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in order to have<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. 4. cap. 5. §. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Zecharias</HI> the Son of
<HI>Baruch</HI> condemned to death: but then they had shook
off their subjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though there appear not any token of this
power of life and death, whilst they were under the
Roman government; yet as soon as they resolve upon
the war, we meet with it very distinctly. They then
appointed such and such to govern <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> others
to command in <HI>Idumea,</HI> others in other places, and <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Matthias,</HI> our historian, to command
in the two <HI>Galilees.</HI> When he came into his govern∣ment,
he says: “choosing seventy of the most pru∣dent
men of the country, he appointed them to be
rulers of all <HI>Galilee,</HI> and in each city also, seven men
judges of lesser matters: and directed that the more
weighty matters, and all capital causes should be
brought to himself and the Seventy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De Bell. lib. ii. c. 20. §. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT may be said: There is scarce any mention made
in <HI>Josephus,</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> inflicting lesser punishments.
To this I answer, that these are particulars which rare∣ly
occur in large histories; the writers judging them
too trifling, for the most part, to appear in their
works. I have however given plain evidences from
<HI>Josephus,</HI> of their power of imprisoning, and inflict∣ing
lesser penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="118"/>
IT is likely also that what <HI>Titus</HI> says, of the right
of the <HI>Jews</HI> to kill any man, though a Roman, who
entered beyond the limits prescribed to uncircumcised
men, may be thought an instance of their having the
power of life and death.</P>
<P>BUT I apprehend the meaning of <HI>Titus</HI> to be, that
if the <HI>Jews</HI> had found any <HI>Gentile</HI> in the Court of the
<HI>Jews</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> had permitted them to take such
an one and kill him immediately. This was a grant
or permission with respect to one particular offense on∣ly.
Nor can there be any consequence drawn from
hence to any other cases, nor to a right of inflicting
death in the way of a judicial processe, either upon
<HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Romans.</HI> It is evident, that upon occasion of
other violations of things sacred, committed by com∣mon
Roman Soldiers, the <HI>Jews</HI> applied to their Pro∣curator
for Justice<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiq. xx. c. 4. §. 3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>3. I would now, by way of collateral evidence, give
some few passages of ancient authors concerning the
state of other provinces.</P>
<P><HI>PILATE</HI> has, in the Gospels, the power of
life and death in <HI>Judea.</HI> All Governours of provinces
seem to have had the same power. If the reader
doubts of it, I refer him to the xth Book of <HI>Plinies</HI>
epistles, which contains his Letters to <HI>Trajan,</HI> and the
Emperour's Rescripts. I produce here only one pas∣sage
from <HI>Philo,</HI> who thus aggravates the sufferings of
<HI>Flaccus,</HI> president of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when he was accused be∣fore
<HI>Caligula</HI> by some of the most considerable men of
that country. “He who had been governour was ac∣cused
by his subjects, by those who had alwaies been
his great enemies, by men, of whose lives he had
lately been Lord and Matter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>In Flacc. p. 986.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Roman Lawyers, whose opi∣nions
I have produced above, the Governours of pro∣vinces
had not only the power of life and death, but
<PB N="101" REF="119"/>
they were also the supreme judges in matters of pro∣perty.
The same thing is evident from the ancient
Roman Authors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Erat mihi in animo rectâ proficisci ad exercitum, aestivos menses reliquos rei militari dare, hibernos jurisdictioni. Cic. ad Att. lib. v. ep. 14. vid. &amp; Ep. ad Quintum Fratrem lib. i. c. 2, 3. &amp; alibi passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As we find the <HI>Jews</HI> had a council, so had also the
people of most other provinces Senates in their great
towns; the members of which were chosen according
to ancient custom<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Quorum ex testimoniis cognoscere potuistis, tota <HI>Sicilia</HI> per triennium neminem ulla in civitate, senatorum factum esse gratis: neminem, ut leges eorum sunt suffragiis—Cic. in Verr. lib. ii. cap. 49. n. 120. vid. &amp; quae sequuntur.</NOTE> or rules prescribed by the Se∣nate
or Emperours<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cautum est—Pompeia lege quae Bithynis data est, ne quis capiat magistratum, neve fit in Senatu minor annorum 30. eadem lege comprehensum est, ut qui ceperint magistratum, sint in Senatu. Plin. lib. x. ep. 83. vid. &amp; ep. 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is also extremely remarkable, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had
Councils and Magistrates, not in <HI>Judea</HI> only, but in
all the provinces of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> where they
lived. For <HI>Philo</HI> says: “<HI>Flaccus</HI> apprehending eight
and thirty of our Senate, which our Saviour and
Benefactor <HI>Augustus</HI> had appointed to take care of
the <HI>jewish</HI> affairs, he lead them through the town to
the theatre, and there ordered them to bewhip'd<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> In Flacc. P. 975. D.</NOTE>.”
Beside these eight and thirty, <HI>Philo</HI> mentions three o∣ther
<HI>jewish</HI> Senators, who were scourged by <HI>Flaccus,</HI>
after their houses had been plundered by the <HI>Egyptian</HI>
rabble; which disgrace he aggravates in this manner:
“There are in that city different methods of inflict∣ing
this punishment, according to the quality of
persons. <HI>Egyptians</HI> are whipped by <HI>Egyptians</HI> with
one sort of rods; <HI>Alexandrians</HI> by <HI>Alexandrians</HI>
only, with another sort of rods. This custom for∣mer
presidents, and <HI>Flaccus</HI> himself in the former
part of his government had observed with regard to
<PB N="102" REF="120"/>
our people<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. p. 976. C.</NOTE> Was it not then intolerable, that,
when an ordinary <HI>Alexandrian Jew</HI> received the
more honourable and liberal stripes, if he commit∣ted
an offense, these rulers, the Senate, men vene∣rable
for their age and dignity should be treated in
this respect worse than their subjects, and be level∣led
with the most obscure and most criminal <HI>Egyp∣tians</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ibid, D. E.</NOTE>?”</P>
<P>FROM the number of Senators, mentioned in these
two passages, it may be concluded, the <HI>Jews</HI> had at
<HI>Alexandria</HI> a full Senate of Seventy. <HI>Philo</HI> speaks of
these men in very magnificent terms, and he also calls
the other <HI>Jews,</HI> their subjects: but nevertheless the
<HI>Jews</HI> were not exempt from the jurisdiction of the Ro∣man
President. whose authority appears to be para∣mount
over all. And the former Presidents, whom
<HI>Philo</HI> does not condemn, and <HI>Flaccus</HI> in the former part
of his government, when according to <HI>Philo</HI>'s own ac∣count,
his administration had been admirable and ex∣emplary,
had been wont to punish <HI>jewsh</HI> people, if
they thought them culpable.</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Philo</HI> says of <HI>Jewish</HI> magistracy at <HI>A∣lexandria</HI>
is confirmed by other writers. For <HI>Josephus</HI>
assures us, that this same <HI>Philo</HI>'s brother <HI>Alexander</HI>
was <HI>Alabarch</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. 18. cap. 9. p. 821. V. II. vid. &amp; p. 809. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 43.</NOTE> And <HI>Claudius,</HI>
in an Edict published in savour of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the
beginning of his reign, (which Edict is preserved en∣tire
in <HI>Josephus)</HI> observes as a precedent; “That
when a <HI>jewish Ethnarch</HI> died, <HI>Augustus</HI> had not for∣bid
<PB N="103" REF="121"/>
bid the creation of a new <HI>Ethnarch</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. ibid. l. xix. c. 5. p. 865. v. 34.</NOTE> willing that
all should remain subject to him, but in the obser∣vation
of their own customs.” Which shews like∣wise,
that the <HI>jewish</HI> Magistracy there was entirely sub∣ject
to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and was not to derogate from their
government of all.</P>
<P>AND after this, <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the <HI>Alabarch</HI> of the
<HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was so considerable a person,
that <HI>Mariamne,</HI> the second daughter of <HI>Herod Agrip∣pa,</HI>

had divorced her first husband.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. Antiq. xx. cap. 6. §. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>STRABO in a passage, not now in his works,
but cited by <HI>Josephus,</HI> says, that “a good part of <HI>A∣lexandria</HI>
is inhabited by this people [<HI>The Jews</HI>].
They have likewise an <HI>Ethnarch,</HI> who administers
their affairs, decides causes, and presides over con∣tracts

the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> was proclaimed by the
<HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is somewhat very remarkable in a Decree
concerning the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Sardis.</HI> It deserves to be tran∣scribbed
here from <HI>Josephus:</HI> “<HI>Lucius Antonius</HI> Son of
<HI>Mark,</HI> Proquaestor and Propraetor, to the Magi∣strates,
Senate, and People of <HI>Saridis,</HI> greeting. The
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
<HI>Jews,</HI> which are our citizens, have shewn me, that
they have always had an Assembly of their own, ac∣cording
to the laws of their country, and<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. xiv. cap. 10. §. 17.</NOTE> a place
of their own, in which they decide the affairs and dif∣ferences
which concern themselves. Having desired
of me that it may be lawful for them so to do, I
have decreed that this (right) be preserved and per∣mitted
to them<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">This decree shews how justly the Apostle rebuked the Chri∣stians at <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 5, 6. <HI>for going to law,</HI> one with another <HI>before the unbelievers:</HI> When they might have decided all lesser dif∣ference among themselves.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I have here given this account of the state of the <HI>Jews</HI>
in other countries, because I apprehend that one great
reason, why many have supposed the <HI>Jews</HI> had the pow∣er
of life and death in <HI>Judea,</HI> is, because they perceive
they had there an High Priest, a Council, and other
officers or magistrates. The privileges of the <HI>Jews</HI> in
other countries, which I have here instanced in, shew
the inference is not good. They had even there a Se∣nate
and Magistrates; but no one will suppose, these
had the power of life and death. Indeed it does, not ap∣pear,
that the people of any province had it. But the
Roman Presidents, and they alone, are ever represent∣ed
as the supreme judges (next under the Senate or the
Emperour, in all causes whatever in their several pro∣vinces<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Praeciarum est enim SUMMO CUM IMPERIO fuisse in <HI>Asia</HI> triennium, sic ut nullum te signum,—nulla conditio percuniae ab summa integritate continentiaque deduxerit, Cic. ad Quint.

WE must therefore suppose, that tho' the <HI>jewish</HI>
Senate and other Magistrates subsisted in <HI>Judea;</HI> yet
their power was not exactly the same they had former∣ly,
but was restrained and diminished under the Ro∣man

have quoted, there is a perfect harmony.</P>

<P>§. XII. WE are now to consult for the external evi∣dences
relating to the state of the <HI>Jews</HI> during the <HI>se∣cond
Period,</HI> which reaches from the resurrection of
our Saviour to the reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="124"/>
IF our Saviour was crucified at the Passover in the
19th year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> A. D. 33. which is the opinion
of many learned men, then we have here the space of
about eight Years. For <HI>Caligula</HI> was killed, and <HI>Clau∣dius</HI>
succeeded him the 24th day of <HI>January,</HI> A. D.
41.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 11. Sueton. Calig. 58. Dio. lib. 59. p. 663. C. D.</NOTE> And <HI>Claudius</HI> in the beginning of his reign
made <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> King of all <HI>Judea.</HI> But if our Sa∣viour
was crucified two or three years sooner, which
is the opinion of many other learned men, then this
Period is proportionably of a longer duration. I en∣ter
not here into any enquiry, which of these two com∣putations
is the most probable; because, as will ap∣pear
presently, it is not material in the present Case,
or at least not necessary.</P>
<P>I must however desire the reader to observe here a
few particulars, though they have been partly menti∣oned
already. <HI>Archelaus</HI> was removed from the go∣vernment
of <HI>Judea,</HI> A. D. 6, or 7. <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Sama∣ria</HI>
were then made a Roman province, with this par∣ticular
circumstance, that they were to be a branch of
the province of <HI>Syria.</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. l. ii. c. 8. Antiq. l. xvii. c. ult.</NOTE>. But that this country of
<HI>Judea</HI> might be kept in good order, there was an offi∣cer,
with the title of Procurator, sent by <HI>Augustus</HI> to
reside and govern there, invested with the supreme au∣thority,
or the power of life and death. The first of
these was <HI>Coponius,</HI> the next <HI>Marcus Ambivius,</HI> his Suc∣cessor
<HI>Annius Rufus,</HI> in whose time <HI>Augustus</HI> died:
A. D. 14. The next was <HI>Valerius Gratus,</HI> who was ap∣pointed
Procurator by <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and continued in the
province eleven years; and was then succeeded by
<HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> who governed <HI>Judea</HI> ten years. So far
every thing is exceeding clear in <HI>Josephus</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xviii. c. 2. §. 1, 2.</NOTE>. There is
indeed some debate, whether these ten years of <HI>Pilate</HI>
expired some time before the Passover, A. D. 36, or
37. I think that <HI>Pilate</HI> left <HI>Judea</HI> before the Passo∣ver,
<PB N="107" REF="125"/>
A. D. 36. and shall give my reasons in another
place.</P>
<P>WE must now endeavour to clear up the state of
<HI>Judea</HI> during the remainder of this period, (<HI>i. e.</HI> after
the Removal of <HI>Pilate</HI>) which cannot be above four
or five years at the most. It may be questioned, whe∣ther
they had now any Procurator, residing among
them with power of life and death; as they had from
the year of our Lord 7. to the year 36 or 37. But that
they were subject to the <HI>Romans</HI> is certain. For at the
same time that the<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Jews</HI> are to be supposed to join with them herein, for they likeswise brought accusations against <HI>Pilate,</HI> as will appear presently.</NOTE> <HI>Samaritans</HI> waited upon <HI>Vitelli∣us,</HI>
the president of <HI>Syria,</HI> entreating that <HI>Pilate</HI> might
be removed, they made very solemn professions of
their willingnesse to continue under the Roman go∣vernment,
and only complained of the tyranny of <HI>Pi∣late</HI>
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. Ant. xviii. cap. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>. And that the <HI>Jews</HI> were subject to the <HI>Romans</HI>
in the last year of this period. A. D. 40. appears from
what <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> saies to <HI>Caligula</HI> in the letter he
sent to him to perswade him to revoke the orders he
had given for erecting his Statue at <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> “I
presume not (<HI>says he</HI>) to ask for my country the
freedom of the City, not yet Liberty, nor Immu∣nity
from tribute<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Legat. ad Caium. p. 1032. c.</NOTE>:” as his letter is given us
by <HI>Philo.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I am apt to think, they had no Procurator
residing among them from the time of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s remo∣val
to <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s accession to the Kingdom of <HI>Judea</HI>
in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI> My reasons are these. <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>'s
account, in his Antiquities, of the removal of
<HI>Pilate</HI> is in these words: “Then <HI>Vitellius</HI> having sent
<HI>Marcellus</HI> his friend to administer the affairs of <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
commanded <HI>Pilate</HI> to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> to answer
<PB N="108" REF="126"/>
to the Emperour for those things of which he was
accused by the <HI>Jews</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. xviii. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>.” Now I think, that
<HI>Marcellus</HI> could not have the power of life and death
in <HI>Judea,</HI> because he was sent thither by <HI>Vitellius</HI> only;
and no officer under the Emperour could convey this
power to another, as we are assured by <HI>Ulpian</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">L. vi. pr. ff. de Off. Procons. &amp; Leg. his words are above, p. 90.</NOTE>.
The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore could not have any one in their
country with this power, till one was sent thither with
it from <HI>Italy.</HI> But there was no one sent from <HI>Rome</HI>
to <HI>Judea,</HI> after this, till the beginning of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s
reign. I shall shew hereafter that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed
by <HI>Vitellius</HI> before the Passover, A. D. 36. Therefore
for one whole year, the last of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> there was no
officer residing in <HI>Judea</HI> with power of life and death.</P>
<P>Now let us see who was sent into <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Caligula</HI>
in the beginning of his reign, and what was the com∣mission
of this officer. <HI>Josephus</HI>'s words are these:
“He [<HI>Caligula</HI>] sent <HI>Marullus</HI> to be master of the
horse in <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Marullum autem misit, qui equitum magister esset in Judaea. Huds. vers. Antiq. xviii. c. 7. §. 10.</NOTE>.” Some would read in <HI>Josephus,</HI>
instead of [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] master of the horse, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]
president. But all copies agree in the present reading;
and so it was in the time of <HI>Epiphanius</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ita quidem &amp; Epiphanius. Forsan tamen <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> legendum. Huds. Not. o. p. 818.</NOTE> It is in∣deed
difficult to say, what <HI>Josephus</HI> means by this
word<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> vocabulum non satis expedio. Petav. Doct. Temp. Vol. ii. p. 314.</NOTE>. But He gives the same title to one <HI>Jucun∣dus,</HI>
an officer in <HI>Judea</HI> in the time of <HI>Florus,</HI> their
last governour before the war<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. lib. ii. cap. 14. p. 1079. v. 21.</NOTE>. If I may offer a
conjecture (and I can do no more) I suspect that <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
means the same officer who is called in <HI>Latin
<PB N="109" REF="127"/>
Praefectus,</HI> and <HI>Praefectus equitum,</HI> an officer of consi∣derable
power under the Presidents<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Appius noster turmas aliquot equitum dederat huic Scaptio, per quas Salaminios coerceret, &amp; eundem habuerat praefectum. Vexabat Salaminios.

sometimes sent into a remote part of a province, to
keep things in good order. Thus <HI>Scaptius</HI> was a Prae∣fect
under <HI>Appius, Cicero</HI>'s predecessor in the province
of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and was sent by him into <HI>Cyprus,</HI> then a
branch of the province of <HI>Cilicia.</HI> In like manner
<HI>Marcellus</HI> was sent into <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Vitellius.</HI> And as for
<HI>Marullus:</HI> as he seems to me to have had the same title
with <HI>Scaptius,</HI> so I think, he had the same power and
authority with him and <HI>Marcellus,</HI> only he was ap∣pointed
by the Emperour, they by Presidents.</P>
<P>BUT whatever was <HI>Marullus</HI>'s post, there is no
reason to think he was Procurator or Governour, since
in all the Copies of <HI>Josephus</HI> he is called only master
of the Horse.</P>
<P>FARTHER, I think there was no Procurator of
<HI>Judea</HI> between the removal of <HI>Pilate</HI> and <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s
reign, because all the great concerns of <HI>Judea</HI> in this
time are managed by <HI>Vilellius,</HI> and then by <HI>Petronius,</HI>
Presidents of <HI>Syria.</HI> Soon after the removal of <HI>Pilate,
Vitellius</HI> displaced <HI>Caiaphas</HI> the High Priest<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. xviii. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE>, and the
next year <HI>Jonathan</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 6. §. 3.</NOTE>; whom he had put into <HI>Caia∣phas</HI>'s
room. It was through the hands of <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
that the <HI>Jews</HI> obtained from <HI>Tiberius</HI> the liberty of ha∣ving
the High Priest's vestment in their own keep∣ing
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 5. § 3.</NOTE>. Afterwards all <HI>Caligula</HI>'s orders about set∣ting
up his Statue at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the method of
<PB N="110" REF="128"/>
treating the <HI>Jews,</HI> if they opposed it, are directed to
<HI>Petronius, Vitellius</HI>'s Successor. And the <HI>Jews</HI> make
all applications to him. We have here one particular
advantage, During the rest of the time which we are
concerned for, we have little light from any one but
<HI>Josephus.</HI> But the History of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s design to pol∣lute
the temple at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is to be found in <HI>Philo,</HI> as
well as in <HI>Josephus.</HI> But yet there is nothing said of
any <HI>jewish</HI> Procurator; no orders sent to him by <HI>Cali∣gula,</HI>
or <HI>Petronius;</HI> no mention made of him by the
<HI>Jews</HI> in any of the petitions they presented at this time:
nor is his conduct blamed, or commended by either of
the forementioned writers. That the name of an infe∣rior
officer does not appear, is not strange<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">And yet <HI>Philo</HI> has made mention of one <HI>Capito,</HI> who was at this time collector of the Roman tribute in <HI>Judea;</HI> and ascribes in part the ill will which <HI>Caligula</HI> bore the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation to calumnies, forged against them by this <HI>Capito,</HI> the better to defeat the com∣plaints which might be brought against himself for the exactions he had been guilty of in his office. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Phi∣lo. de legat. p. 1020. E. And this passage ought to be added to the proofs I have given above, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were tributary to the Roman Emperour.</NOTE>; but
that the Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> should not be mentioned,
if there was one is unaccountable.</P>
<P>THIS then was the state of <HI>Judea</HI> in this period.
<HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was Procurator there till some time be∣fore
the Passover, A. D. 36. After that, there was
no Procurator in the country; but the <HI>Jews</HI> were im∣mediately
under the government, first of <HI>Vitellius,</HI> and
then of <HI>Petronius,</HI> Presidents of <HI>Syria,</HI> till the accession
of <HI>Herod Agrippa.</HI> There might be an officer under
these Presidents of <HI>Syria,</HI> called master, or Prefect of
the horse, but there was no officer constantly residing
in <HI>Judea</HI> with power of life and death.</P>
<P>WE are now to cast our eye upon the transactions
of this period, related in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles. Peter</HI>
and <HI>John,</HI> and the other Apostles were summoned be∣fore
<PB N="111" REF="129"/>
the <HI>jewish</HI> Council imprisoned, threatened, scourg∣ed,
<HI>Stephen</HI> was stoned, and a very severe persecution
commenced, and was carried on for a considerable time
against all the disciples of Jesus in that country, and at
<HI>Damas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.</HI> This may be thought very extraordinary,
if the <HI>Jews</HI> were (as certainly they were at this time)
under the Roman Government; and if they had not
the power of life and death within themselves.</P>
<P>NOW I would in the first place observe, that though
the state of <HI>Judea,</HI> as I have just now represented it
from <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Philo,</HI> did not afford us any consi∣derations
which might enable us to account for such a
behaviour of the <HI>Jews</HI> as seems inconsistent with their
subjection to the <HI>Romans;</HI> yet it may be fairly supposed
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s history, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were very rio∣tous
and turbulent at this time.</P>
<P>HERE was now in this country a number of men,
who affirmed, that Jesus, who had wrought no tem∣poral
deliverance for the <HI>jewish</HI> people, was the Christ;
That He was had been lately condemned and crucifi∣ed
by them, was now risen from the dead, and was as∣cended
up to Heaven. They exhorted even the rulers
of the <HI>Jews</HI> and all the people to repentance. They
proved their assertions, and supported their exhorta∣tions
by no other method, but by reasonings from the
Scripture, and by a healing power exerted on many
miserable objects. But however, the priests and all
the rulers, were grieved that they taught the people,
and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the
dead. And though these disciples of Jesus made no
tumult, yet they were very firm in their tenets; and
when commanded by the councel <HI>not to speak at all
nor preach in the name of Jesus,</HI> they scrupled not to
profess, that it was with them an undoubted maxim
rather to <HI>obey God than them,</HI> and told them, that
they <HI>could not but speak the things which they had seen and
heard,</HI> Acts iv. 20. And so they did. Whereupon
we find, they were brought again before the councel:
and <HI>the high priest asked them, saying, Did not we straitly
<PB N="112" REF="130"/>
command you, that you should not teach in this name?
And behold ye have filled</HI> Jerusalem <HI>with your doctrine,
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us,</HI> Ch. v. 28.
May not any man be assured that the high priest, who
spoke these words, and the council in whose name he
spoke, would exert all the authority they were posses∣sed
of a against the disciples of Jesus? As rulers in Syna∣gogues
beat them there, as members of the council is∣sue
out orders for apprehending all of that way, impri∣son
them, whip them in publick places; and, if this
was all they could do themselves, have them, after that,
before the Governour; and if he did not fully execute
their rage, by artful insinuations raise a spirit in their
people, which the most vigilant administration could
not hinder from breaking out sometimes into riots, and
such like disorders; by which some of the followers of
Jesus might lose their lives. No people in the world
are always peaceable and orderly, as they should be;
and the <HI>Jews</HI> were as likely as any to assume a power
that was not legal. We have proofs of it in <HI>Josephus.</HI>
“When <HI>Fadus</HI> came Procurator into <HI>Judea,</HI> he found
the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Peraea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">That is, on the other side of <HI>Jordan.</HI></NOTE> in a riot fighting with the
<HI>Philadelphians</HI> about the limits of the village <HI>Mias.</HI>
And indeed the people of <HI>Peraea</HI> had taken up
arms without the consent of their chief men, and
had killed a good number of the <HI>Philadelphians.</HI>
When <HI>Fadus</HI> heard of it, he was very much pro∣voked,
that they had taken up arms and not left the
decision to him, if they thought the <HI>Philadelphians</HI>
had done them any wrong<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. xx. c. 1. §. 1.</NOTE>.” There is another
instance of the like kind afterwards. The <HI>Samaritans</HI>
had offered an injury to some <HI>Jews,</HI> as they were pas∣sing
through their country to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The <HI>Jesus</HI>
made reprizals. “Hereupon the chief men of the
<HI>Samaritans</HI> go to <HI>Ummidius Quadratus,</HI> President of
<PB N="113" REF="131"/>
<HI>Syria,</HI> then at <HI>Tyrus;</HI> and accuse the <HI>Jews</HI> of plun∣dering
and burning their towns. Nor were they so
much concerned, they said, for the injury done to
them, as for the contempt shewed to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
to whom they ought rather to have appealed as
judges, if they had been injured; and not make
incursions of their own heads, as they had done,
as if they were under no subjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI>
They therefore came to him for justice.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. xx. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE riot of the <HI>Jews</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan</HI> seems to have
happened in the interval between the death of <HI>Herod
Agrippa,</HI> and the arrival of <HI>Fadus</HI> in the province.
The incursions into <HI>Samaria</HI> were made, while <HI>Cuma∣nus</HI>
was actually in <HI>Judea.</HI> Indeed <HI>Josephus</HI> endea∣vours
to acquit the chief men of <HI>Judea</HI> as to both
these facts. But the common people seldom take
arms, and make incursions, without some encourage∣ment
from their superiors. And if the chief men at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> were perfectly innocent as to this last af∣fair,
<HI>Quadratus</HI> the President of <HI>Syria</HI> must have been
horribly imposed upon, though he came into the coun∣try
on purpose to examine the case upon the spot. For
he beheaded some <HI>Jews,</HI> and crucified others, and sent
the High Priest, the captain of the temple, and di∣vers
other chief men at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> to answer
for themselves.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Bell. l. ii. c. 12. §. 6. &amp; Antiq. ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF then some of the <HI>jewish</HI> proceedings mentioned
in the <HI>Acts,</HI> seem not very suitable to the state of a
Roman province, it may be fairly taken for granted,
they were illegal or tumulcuous.</P>
<P>BUT secondly, I am apt to think the state of the
<HI>Jews</HI> at this time, if reflected on, will help us to ac∣count
of these proceedings. If our Saviour was cru∣cified
at the Passover, A. D. 33. then this was the
<PB N="114" REF="132"/>
eighth passover of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s administration: for he came
into the province before the passover of the year 26.
But if our Saviour was crucified in the 29th year of
the Christian <HI>Aera,</HI> which is the soonest that is suppo∣sed
by any, yet that would be the fourth passover af∣ter
<HI>Pilate</HI>'s arrival in that country. Now it was very
common for the presidents, if they had not behaved
well, to stand in fear of the people of their province;
and they dreaded extremely the sending Complaints to
the Emperour. And in order toward off these, they
usually thought it proper to do some popular things.</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> has given us a remarkable instance in
<HI>Flaccus,</HI> Prefect OF <HI>Egypt,</HI> about this very time. The
five first years of his administration, which were the
five last years of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign, <HI>Flaccus</HI> was a most
excellent Governour. But in the 6th year of his pre∣sidentship,
which was the first of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s reign, he
became quite another man<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Philo in Flac. p. 965, 966.</NOTE>. It is not necessary to
produce here all the reasons of this alteration. But
in the life-time of <HI>Tiberius, Flaccus</HI> had been no friend
of <HI>Caligula.</HI> When therefore <HI>Caligula</HI> came to be Em∣perour,
and had put to death the young <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and
<HI>Macro,</HI> in whom <HI>Flaccus</HI> had some interest, he was
thrown into a terrible fright: his concern was visible,
and all the <HI>Egyptians</HI> knew very well the cause of it:
hereupon they got him entirely into their own hands,
“and of a Governour <HI>Flaccus</HI> became a subject, and
they of subjects became presidents, inventors of
useless decrees, directors of all affairs, taking him
in as a mere mute image in a play, for no other rea∣son
but because he had the name of Governour<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. p. 988. A.—C.</NOTE>.
<PB N="115" REF="133"/>
These men therefore, the <HI>Dionysii,</HI> the <HI>Lampones,</HI>
the <HI>Isidores,</HI> all these conspire together to form a
most wicked design against the <HI>Jews:</HI> and coming
to <HI>Flaccus</HI> they tell him; Sir, You have lost the
young <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and your next hope after him,
your friend <HI>Macro:</HI> you have no expectations of
favour from the Emperour, but rather otherwise.
We must necessarily contrive for you some power∣ful
advocate with <HI>Caius</HI> [<HI>Caligula</HI>]. This advocate,
Sir, is the city of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which has been ever
honoured by the Imperial family, and especially by
our present Sovereign: If she may but obtain some
favour of you, she will undertake your cause. You
can oblige her by nothing so much as by deliver∣ing
up the <HI>Jews</HI> into her hands. Then, he who
ought to have been provoked at so impudent a pro∣posal,
and to have reprimanded the authors of it
as incendiaries, and disturbers, of the public peace,
tamely complied with what they desired.”.</P>
<P>AFTER this, <HI>Flaccus</HI> began to shew a strange ne∣glect
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and in all causes the <HI>Jews</HI> were cast,
till at length he became their open enemy. The <HI>E∣gyptians</HI>
taking encouragement from this behaviour
came by degrees to the rifling of the <HI>Jews</HI> houses, and
murdered great numbers of them. “And the Presi∣dent
of the country, who, if he had pleased, could
in one hour have quieted this mad multitude, pre∣tended
not to see, or hear anything<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Id. de Legat. ad Cai. p. 1010. E.</NOTE>.”. The
<PB N="116" REF="134"/>
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> receiving no rebukes for what they had
done already, proceeded to demolish the <HI>jewish</HI> ora∣tories
at <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>THUS matters went in <HI>Egypt.</HI> The people there
had no right, according to the constitution of the
country, to treat the <HI>Jews</HI> as they did; nor did the
Prefect formally convey the power of life and death
to them. But for his own convenience he overlooked
their disorderly proceedings. The Case of <HI>Pilate</HI> in
<HI>Judea</HI> seems very much to have resembled that of
<HI>Flaccus</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> That is, they were both apprehen∣sive
of the Emperour's displeasure, though perhaps
the grounds of these apprehensions, were different.
<HI>Pilate</HI> had been tyrannical in the very beginning of
his administration, and had thereby rendered himself
disagreeable to the <HI>Jews.</HI> For this reason he stood in
fear of them. This appears in the prosecution of
Jesus before him. The <HI>Jews</HI> cried out, <HI>If thou let this
man go, thou art not</HI> Cesar's <HI>friend,</HI> John xix. 12. <HI>Pi∣late</HI>
seems to have understood the meaning of this
Speech. If he had not gratified them in this point,
they might have drawn up a long list of male-admini∣strations
for the Emperour's view.</P>
<P>HIS condemnation of Jesus at the importunity of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> contrary to his own judgement and inclina∣tion,
declared to them more than once, was a point
gained: and his government must have been ever
after much weakened by so mean a condescension.
And that <HI>Pilate</HI>'s influence in the province continued
to decline, is manifest, in that, the people of it pre∣vailed
at last to have him removed, in a very ignomi∣nious
manner, by <HI>Vitellius</HI> president of <HI>Syria.</HI> It is
therefore highly probable, that to screen other acts
of injustice, and to gratifie the chief men at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
he might sign decrees of condemnation against some
of the disciples of Jesus; or at lest connive at, or not
restrain some irregular proceedings of the <HI>jewish</HI> ma∣gistrates,
and the riots of the people. Nor can it be
concluded, that <HI>Pilate</HI> did not act in this manner, be∣cause
<PB N="117" REF="135"/>
he had not the favour of the people of his pro∣vince.
For <HI>Flaccus</HI> did himself no real service by all
his compliances with the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but was at last ac∣cused
by the men whose tool he had been<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vid. Phil. in Flacc. p. 985, 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner then, affairs might be carried
on in <HI>Judea,</HI> during the remainder of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s admini∣stration
after the resurrection of our Saviour, till a∣bout
the beginning of the year 36.</P>
<P>AND after the removal of <HI>Pilate,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> would,
very probably, take an unusual licence; they not
having then any Procurator among them, but being
more immediately under the government of the Pre∣sident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> whose chief residence was at <HI>An∣tioch.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, <HI>Vitellius</HI> seems to have been at a yet
greater distance from them the greatest part of the
year that followed the removal of <HI>Pilate.</HI> This, if I
mistake not, was the season of <HI>Vitellius</HI>'s expedition to
<HI>Parthia.</HI> It is true, that <HI>Suetonius</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Namque Artabanus Parthorum Rex, odium semper contem∣tumque Tiberii prae se ferens, amicitiam ejus [Caii] ultro petiit venitque ad colloquium legati consularis: &amp; transgressus Euphratem, aquilas &amp; signa Romana Caesarumque imagines adoravit, Calig. cap. 14.</NOTE>, and <HI>Dio</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> lib. 59. p. 661. B. C.</NOTE>,
place the congresse of <HI>Vitellius</HI> and <HI>Artabanus</HI> in the
first year of <HI>Caligula.</HI> But <HI>Josephus</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 18. c. 5.</NOTE> places it in
the last of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign; and gives so distinct an
account of this matter, that he cannot but be relied
on. He says that <HI>Vitellius,</HI> having, whilst in <HI>Syria,</HI>
ordered <HI>Pilate</HI> away for <HI>Rome,</HI> went up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
to the Passover, which appears to me very evidently
to be the passover of the year 36. Having put
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> out of the priesthood, and done divers other
things to the great satisfaction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he re∣turned
to <HI>Antioch. Josephus</HI> then says, that <HI>Vitellius</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="136"/>
having received orders from <HI>Tiberius</HI> to make an alliance
with <HI>Artabanus,</HI> went to the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> where <HI>Vitelli∣us</HI>
and <HI>Artabanus</HI> had a congresse, and a league was
made; that <HI>Artabanus</HI> sent his son hostage to <HI>Tiberi∣us;</HI>
that after the league was made, <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Te∣trarch</HI>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who was there, entertained the pre∣sident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> and the King of <HI>Parthia;</HI> and sent an
expresse to <HI>Rome</HI> with an account of the conclusion of
this treaty, as did also <HI>Vitellius. Herod</HI>'s messenger
came first to <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> wrote back to <HI>Vitelli∣us,</HI>
that this Expresse brought him no news, for he had
heard all before. <HI>Vitellius</HI> thinking <HI>Herod</HI> had done
him a great injury herein, retained a secret grudge
against him, till he had an opportunity of being re∣venged
in the reign of <HI>Caligula.</HI> At the next Passo∣ver,
A. D. 37. <HI>Vitellius</HI> was again at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> So
that this expedition to the <HI>Euphrates</HI> was made in the
year 36. <HI>Josephus</HI> appears perfectly master of this
whole affair; the concerns of <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> are
interwoven with it. <HI>Josephus</HI> was nearer the event
than <HI>Suetonius</HI> or <HI>Dio.</HI> Besides, <HI>Tacitus</HI> concurs with
him. For he says, that A. U. 788. which is the year
of our Lord 33, when <HI>C. Cestius Gallus,</HI> and <HI>M. Ser∣vilius
Nonianus</HI> were consuls, <HI>Tiberius</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Et cunctis quae apud Orientem parabantur, L. Vitellium praefecit. Ann. l. 6. c. 32.</NOTE> gave <HI>Vitellius</HI>
the command of all things in the <HI>East.</HI> He then re∣lates
<HI>Vitellius</HI>'s expedition, and what he performed in
it, and concludes his account thus; “And then he
returned with the army into <HI>Syria.</HI> I have here put
together the actions of two Summers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Exin cum legionibus in Syriam remeavit. Quae duabus aestatibus gesta conjunxi, quo reuiesceret animus a domesticis malis. ibid. c. 37. fin. 38. init.</NOTE>.” I think
it therefore very plain, that according to <HI>Tacitus,</HI> this
commission, given to <HI>Vitellius</HI> in the year 35, was
finished in 36.</P>
<P>THIS then was a fine opportunity for a people,
fond of power, to exert some acts of authority they
could not have done, whilst a Governour was among
<PB N="119" REF="137"/>
them, or near them. The behaviour of <HI>Ananus,</HI> and
his council, in the interval between the death of <HI>Por∣cius
Festus,</HI> and the arrival of his successor <HI>Albinus,</HI> is
a proof of it. Nor were there any on whom they
were so likely to shew their power, as the followers
of Jesus.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, such was the temper of this <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
that it may be fairly supposed, the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed some
peculiar indulgences under his administration.</P>
<P>THERE are divers things recorded of him in <HI>Jo∣sephus,</HI>
which may satisfie us there was a very loving
correspondence between him and the chief men of the
<HI>jewish</HI> nation. At the request of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Sama∣ritans</HI>
he removed <HI>Pilate.</HI> The passover following he
went up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and was magnificently received
by the <HI>Jews.</HI> It was through his hands, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> obtained from <HI>Tiberius</HI> the right of having in
their own keeping the High Priest's sacred Vestment,
which he wore on their great Solemnities<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiq. l. xviii. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE>: a privi∣lege
they had not enjoyed before, since the beginning
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign. This favour they received at the
passover in the year 36.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the next year, when <HI>Vitellius</HI>
was going to march his forces through <HI>Judea,</HI> which
was the shortest way, to attack <HI>Aretas;</HI> at the request
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he ordered his troops to take another
rout, that he might not offend them with his idola∣trous
ensigns; and when he had given these orders,
he went up himself to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to worship God<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. ibid.</NOTE>.
<HI>Vitellius</HI> is not to be blamed for any of these things,
but they are an argument that the <HI>jewish</HI> people had a
great influence upon him.</P>
<P>AND from the Roman historians it appears, that
<HI>Vitellius</HI> was a man of a most obsequious disposition.
For he, who had sacrificed to God at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="138"/>
when he was out of his province, and returned to
<HI>Rome,</HI> paid divine honours to the Emperour. And
indeed was one of the first, that began that idola∣trous
worship, which <HI>Caligula</HI> was so fond of the latter
part of his reign. <HI>Vitellius</HI> was so exquisite in this, and
other kinds of flattery, that at length his name became
proverbial to denote an eminent flatterer<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem miri in adulando ingenii, primus C.

<P>AND though it should be still thought notwith∣standing
what I have said above, that <HI>Marcellus,</HI> and
<HI>Marullus</HI> were possessed of the full powers of a Procu∣rator
in <HI>Judea;</HI> yet it must be allowed, that <HI>Vitellius</HI>
had a great influence on the affairs of <HI>Judea,</HI> all the
time he was president of <HI>Syria</HI> after the removal of <HI>Pi∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te,</HI>
because all the great concerns of the <HI>Jews</HI> men∣tioned
by <HI>Josephus</HI> are transacted by him.</P>
<P>I have not attempted to settle the date of the parti∣cular
facts of this second period related in the <HI>Acts of
the Apostles.</HI> Learned men are very much divided
about the year of <HI>Stephen</HI>'s death, which is the most
remarkable of all those facts. Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI>
places it in the year 33<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ann. p. 617. ed. Lat. Lond. 1650.</NOTE>, Bishop <HI>Pearson</HI> in the
latter end of the year 34<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ann. Paulin. p. 1.</NOTE>, Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI> in the
year 37<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Annal. P. Eccles. A. D. 37. n. 14, 15.</NOTE>. The disciples of Jesus were, I think,
much harrassed by the <HI>jewish</HI> council from the very
beginning, immediately after the descent of the Holy
Ghost upon them at <HI>Pentecost;</HI> though about the time
that <HI>Stephen</HI> was stoned, a more fierce, and more ge∣neral
persecution came on, [<HI>Acts</HI> viii. 1. xi. 9.] and
continued for some time. And though it may be dif∣ficult
to settle exactly when it began, and when it
<PB N="121" REF="139"/>
yet I think it most probable, that though it
might be abated in the year 38, it was not over be∣fore
the third year of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s reign, that is, the
<HI>thirty ninth</HI> year of the Christian <HI>Aera:</HI> In which
year <HI>Vitellius</HI> was recalled from <HI>Syria,</HI> and was suc∣ceded
by <HI>Petronius</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. Noris. Cenotaph. Pis. Diff. ii. p. 330, 331. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. D. 39. n. 2.</NOTE>. Nay, possibly it was not
quite at an end till the year 40.</P>
<P>IF some few of the <HI>jewish</HI> proceedings in this period
seem somewhat extraordinary, I imagine, they may
be accounted for from the particular state of the af∣fairs
in <HI>Judea,</HI> which I have just given a view of.
The reader is able to judge of it himself, and I make
no more reflexions.</P>
<P>WE are now to observe the remarkable words of
St. <HI>Luke,</HI> Acts ix. 31. <HI>Then had the churches rest
throughout all</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Galilee, <HI>and</HI> Samaria. This
<HI>rest</HI> of the churches will be easily accounted for from
the following particulars. Soon after <HI>Caligula</HI>'s acces∣sion,
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> suffered very much from
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in that City (as has been already obser∣ved)
and at length, their oratories there were all de∣stroyed.
In the third year of <HI>Caligula,</HI> A. D. 39.
<HI>Petronius</HI> was sent into <HI>Syria</HI> with order to set up
the Emperour's Statue in the temple at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> It
is not improbable, but the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> might be
affected at the condition of their countrymen at <HI>A∣lexandria,</HI>
where by this time they were almost ruin∣ed:
But this order from <HI>Caligula</HI> was a thunder∣stroke.
There is indeed some doubt whether <HI>Petro∣nius</HI>
published this order in the year of our Lord 39, or
40. But when ever it was made known, the <HI>Jews</HI> must
have been too much engaged afterwards to mind any
thing else: as may appear from the accounts <HI>Philo,</HI>
and <HI>Josephus</HI> have given us of this affair.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says, “That <HI>Caligula</HI> ordered
<HI>Petronius</HI> to go with an army to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to set
<PB N="122" REF="140"/>
up his Statues in the temple there; enjoining him,
id the <HI>Jews</HI> opposed it, to put to death all that
made any resistance, and to make all the rest of the
nation Slaves. <HI>Petronius</HI> therefore marched from
<HI>Antioch</HI> into <HI>Judea</HI> with three legions and a large
body of auxiliaries raised in <HI>Syria.</HI>—All were
hereupon filler with consternation, the army be∣ing
come as far as <HI>Ptolemais</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 10. §. 1.</NOTE> The <HI>Jews</HI> then
gathering together went to the plain near <HI>Ptolemais,</HI>
and entreated <HI>Petronius</HI> in the first place for their
Lawes, and in the next place for themselves”.
<HI>Petronius</HI> was moved by their entreaties, and leaving
his army and the Statues at <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> went into <HI>Ga∣lilee;</HI>
and at <HI>Tiberias</HI> calls together the chief men of
the <HI>jewish</HI> people, and exhorts them to submit to the
Emperour's orders. When they could not engage so
to do, he asked them; “Will ye then fight against
<HI>Cesar.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> answered him, that they offered
up sacrifices twice every day for <HI>Cesar</HI> and the Ro∣man
People. But that if he would set up the ima∣ges,
he ought first of all to sacrifice the whole
<HI>jewish</HI> nation, and that they were ready to submit
themselves with their wives and children to the
slaughter<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. § 3. 4. vid. &amp; Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 9.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> says, That the tidings of these orders
having reached <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> them <HI>Jews</HI> “abandoning
their cities, villages, and the open country, all
went to <HI>Petronius</HI> in <HI>Phenicia,</HI> both men and wo∣men,
the old, the young, and the middle aged;—
that they threw themselves down upon the ground
before <HI>Petronius,</HI> with weeping and lamentation;
—that being ordered by him to rise up, they ap∣proached
him covered with dust, with their hands
behind them, as men condemned to die: and that
then the Senate bespoke <HI>Petronius</HI> in this manner:
We come to you, Sir, as you see, unarmed. We have
<PB N="123" REF="141"/>
brought with us our wives and children and rela∣tions,
and throw our selves down before you, as at
the feet of <HI>Caius,</HI> having left none at home, that
you may save all, or destroy all<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Philo de legat. ad Cai. p. 1024, 1025.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>PETRONIUS</HI> deferred his journey to <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI>
that the <HI>Jews</HI> might not, out of concern for
such a violation of their religion, neglect their ga∣thering
in their corn, it being then ripe, as <HI>Philo</HI>
says<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1028. A.</NOTE>: or lose the Seeds-time, as <HI>Josepbus</HI> says<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiq. xviii. cap, 9. § 4.</NOTE>.
He was the more moved by this consideration, be∣cause
it was expected, that <HI>Caligula</HI> would be at <HI>A∣lexandria</HI>
the next summer: And he judged it not
proper to do any thing that might hinder a sufficient
plenty for the company that would follow the Empe∣rour
from <HI>Italy,</HI> and the concourse of the Princes of
<HI>Asia,</HI> and other great men in those parts. And in
his letter to <HI>Caligula,</HI> he made use of this, as the ex∣cuse
for not immediately executing his orders<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Philo ubi supra.</NOTE>.
These two writers differ somewhat as to the time,
when the <HI>Jews</HI> waited on <HI>Petronius.</HI> Possibly they
might be reconciled together even as to this. How∣ever,
they agree in representing the concern of the
<HI>Jews</HI> as very great and general. And it is very like∣ly,
that the persecution of the Christians ceased now,
and that the <HI>Jews</HI> were fully employed in warding off
this terrible blow from the temple, which was their
glory and confidence.</P>
<P>SOME learned men have ascribed this rest of the
churches to the conversion of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had been
a very zealous Perfecutor. But this is, in my opini∣on,
to do St. <HI>Paul</HI> a great deal of wrong, on one
hand, and too much honour, on the other. It ap∣pears
to me a great injustice to ascribe to him all the
sufferings of the Christians which ensued upon the
death of <HI>Stephen;</HI> when, after his conversion, we find
the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Judea, Damascus,</HI> and every other place
<PB N="124" REF="142"/>
were filled with malice and spite against Christianity,
and against St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and every one else of that way.
On the other hand, it is doing him at the same time
too much honour. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was then but a <HI>young
man;</HI> [Acts vii. 58.] and though a forward and ac∣tive
instrument, yet he could be no more than an in∣strument
in that Perfection. It cannot be supposed,
that whilst he was with the High Priests and <HI>Pharisees,</HI>
they were directed and animated by him; and that
when he had lest them, their spirits were so sunk, that
they could no longer pursue their old measures. His
own dangers at <HI>Damascus</HI> and <HI>Jerusalam</HI> are a proof
of the contrary.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, according to the series of St. <HI>Luke's</HI>
History, though the <HI>great perfection,</HI> [Acts viii. 1. xi.
19.] he speaks of, might be abated sooner; yet it
could not be quite over till several years after St. <HI>Paul</HI>
conversion. St. <HI>Luke</HI> first mentions St. <HI>Paul's</HI> return
from <HI>Damascus</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> (which was not till three
years after [<HI>Gal.</HI> i. 18.] his conversion) and the treat∣ment
he met with from the <HI>Grecians: which when the
brethren knew, they brought him down to</HI> Cesarea: <HI>and
sent him forth to</HI> Tarsus. THEN <HI>had the churches rest
throughout all</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Galilee, <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>and
were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and
in. the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied, Acts</HI>
ix. 29, 31.</P>
<P>LASTLY, According to the description St. <HI>Luke</HI>
gives us of this <HI>rest</HI> of the churches in the words just
now transcribed, it was very extensive, even all over
<HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Samaria;</HI> and very com∣pleat,
and the churches had no molestation. So con∣siderable
an event must have been owing to some other
considerable event, with which the whole people of
that country was affected. I had no sooner read the
account which <HI>Philo</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI> have given of the
sufferings of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the immi∣nent
danger of ruine which that whole people in <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
and other places were in, in the reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="143"/>
but I concluded, that this state of their affairs brought
on the rest of the Christian <HI>churches,</HI> which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
speaks of, and which certainly happened about this
time. Whether I am in the right, or not, others will
judge.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not expressly told us how long this
rest of the churches lasted; but it is likely, that it
reached some way into <HI>Herod Agrippa's</HI> reign. He was
at <HI>Rome</HI> when <HI>Caligula</HI> was killed, and was very ser∣viceable
to his Successor <HI>Claudius,</HI> in settling matters
between him and the Senate<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. lib. ii. c. 11.</NOTE>. But this is certain,
that the great danger the <HI>Jews</HI> were in of utter ruine
in the reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI> and the gracious, as well as
just edicts passed in their savour by <HI>Claudius,</HI> in the
beginning of his reign, did them but little good. For
St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, that when <HI>Herod strelched forth his hand
to vex certain of the church, and killed</HI> James <HI>with the</HI>
sword, the satisfaction, which they expressed in these
cruelties, was an inducement to him <HI>to take Peter also,</HI>
Acts xii. 1—3.</P>
<P>§. XIII. THIS brings me to the proceedings of
the third Period, <HI>the reign of Herod.</HI> But I need not
add any thing here to what has been already said in
the former chapter; where it has been shewn, that
<HI>Herod</HI> had at this time sovereign authority in <HI>Judea,</HI>
though he was dependent on the Roman Empe∣rour.</P>
<P>I have now given the reader a view of the State of
<HI>Judea,</HI> according to the sacred, and other writers,
so far as I proposed at the beginning of this chap∣ter.</P>
<P>I must not proceed any farther, till I have owned
my self much indebted to Mr. <HI>Huber</HI> for his <HI>disserta∣tion</HI>
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Zachariae Huber Dis∣sertationum Libri tres. Amst. 1721. Dissertatio prima, qua adseri∣tur Judaeorum magistratus tempore Christi Servatoris, non habuisse Merum Imperium, sive jus gladii.</NOTE> on this Subject. But by this acknowledg∣ment
I have not discharged all my obligations to this
<PB N="126" REF="144"/>
learned and agreeable writer. I have found him a
good guide vpon other occasions beside this.</P>
<P>I am sensible, some learned men have given a diffe∣rent
account of this matter. But it will not be ex∣pected,
I should enter here into controversies with
any. This article is long enough already. I shall
however make a few remarks upon Dr. <HI>Lightfoot's</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See his Hebrew and Talmudical Exercitations on <HI>Mat.</HI> xxyi. 3. <HI>John</HI> xviii. 31.</NOTE>
account taken from the <HI>Talmudical</HI> and other <HI>jewish</HI>
writers.</P>
<P>1. THE Doctor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 248.</NOTE> quotes these words from the
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> Talmud. <HI>A Tradition. Forty years before
the Temple was destroyed, judgment in capital causes was
taken away from Israel.</HI> And the Doctor says him∣self
<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 611.</NOTE>: “It cannot be denied but that all capital
judgment, or sentence upon life, had been taken
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> for above forty years before the
destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as they oftentimes them∣selves
confess.” I think, the natural meaning of
the words of the Tradition is, that the People of the
<HI>Jews</HI> were deprived of the right of inflicting capital
punishment, by some superior power or force. It
does therefore in the main confirm my account. For
since we know, that <HI>Judea</HI> was a Roman province for
some considerable time before the destruction of <HI>Jeru∣salem;</HI>
it may be reasonably concluded, the Roman
Government had <HI>taken away judgment in capital causes.</HI>
But this tradition is inaccurate as to the time: for if
the <HI>Jews</HI> had lost this power for <HI>forty years before the
destruction of the Temple,</HI> then they had it not in the
reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> and consequently not after
<HI>Judea</HI> was first made a Roman province, A. D. 6,
or 7. which was above sixty years before the ruine of
their City, However, it is plain the just mentioned
<HI>Herod</HI> had supreme power in <HI>Judea.</HI> How far he en∣trusted
the Council with judgment in capital causes,
I do not pretend to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="145"/>
2. BUT yet Doctor <HI>Lightfoot</HI> says, “The <HI>Romans</HI>
did not take away their power of judging in capital
matters, but they by their own oscitancy, supine
and unreasonable lenity lost it themselves. For so
the <HI>Gemarah</HI> goes on. <HI>Rabh Nachmanbar Isaac
saith, Let him not say that they did not judge judg∣ments
of Mulcts, for they did not judge capital judg∣ments
neither. And whence comes this? When they
saw that so many murders and homicides multiplied up∣on
them, that they could not well judge and call them
to an account, they said, It is better for us that we
remove from place to place. For how can we other∣wise
not contract a guilt upon our selves?</HI> They
thought themselves obliged to punish murderers,
whilst they sat in the <HI>room Gazith:</HI> for <HI>the place
itself engaged them to it.</HI> They are the words of
the <HI>Gemarists.</HI> Upon which the Gloss.—<HI>They re∣moved
therefore from</HI> Gazith, <HI>and sate in the</HI> Ta∣berne
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W M. Ibid. p.</NOTE>.” I cannot think this a just account. If
robbers and murderers were so numerous, that the
Council could not punish them, yet certainly the
Christians were not able for <HI>forty years</HI> together <HI>be∣fore
the destruttion of the temple</HI> either by their own
numbers, or by their interest with the people, to
strike any awe upon the Council. And if they had
a lenity and tendernesse for <HI>Israelitith</HI> Robbers and
Murderers (which I do not deny) yet they had little
or no tendernesse for Christians, if there be any truth
in the history of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> or of ancient
Christian writers. And yet they did not judge any of
these capitally. For so the <HI>Tradition,</HI> confirmed like∣wise
(as the Doctor allows) by many <HI>jewish</HI> writers,
says; judgment in <HI>capital causes bad been taken away
from them for forty years before the destruction of the
temple.</HI> Since therefore they did not judge Christians
capitally, and since they could not be restrained from
it by any dread of the Christians, nor by lenity toward
<PB N="128" REF="146"/>
them; it follows, they must have been hindered by
some superior authority. And what could that be
but the Roman?</P>
<P>3.“ THAT we may yet farther confirm our opi∣nion,
<HI>says the Doctor,</HI> that the authority of their
council was not taken away by the <HI>Romans,</HI> we
will produce two Stories, as clear examples of the
thing we assert. One is this: <HI>R. Lazar,</HI> son of
<HI>R. Sadock</HI> said, <HI>When I was a little boy, sitting on
my father's shoulders, I saw the daughter of a priest
that had played the harlot, compassed round with
faggotts and burnt. Hieros. Sanhedr. fol.</HI> 24. 2,
The Council no doubt judging and condemning
her, and this after <HI>Judea</HI> had then groaned many
years under the Roman yoke; for that same <HI>R.
Lazar</HI> saw the destruction of the City.” The o∣ther
Story is taken from the same book, and is told
of one “<HI>Ben Sudta in Lydda. They placed two disci∣pies
of the wise in ambush for him, and they brought
him before the council ard stoned him.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI>
openly professe that this was done to him in the
days of <HI>R. Akiba,</HI> long after the destruction of the
City; and yet then, as you see, the council still
retained its authority in judging of capital causes.
They might do it for all the <HI>Romans,</HI> if they dar∣ed
to do it to the Criminals<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 249.</NOTE>.” I think the <HI>first,</HI>
viz. <HI>R. Lazar's</HI> Story proves too much; for it not
only proves that the <HI>Romans</HI> had not taken away this
power from the Council, but that it was not taken
away at all for forty years before the destruction of
the Temple. But this is a contradiction to the <HI>Tradi∣tion,</HI>
which the Doctor allowes to be true, and well
supported. If we must suppose the fight, <HI>the little boy</HI>
is said to have had <HI>sitting upon his father's Shoulders,</HI>
be matter of fact, it will be needful to reconcile it with
the <HI>Tradition</HI> abovementioned. This I don't know
how to do any otherwise, than by suposing, that the
<PB N="129" REF="147"/>
<HI>Tradition</HI> represents the legal state of the constitution
they were under, for forty years before the destruction
of the temple; and that the burning of the Priest's
daughter, if it was don by order of the <HI>jewish</HI> coun∣cel,
was an irregular and illegal action. The same
thing ought also to be supposed of the second story, if
it be true. But this way of reconciliation would not
suit the Doctor.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, though the Tradition confirms
my account; I cannot but think, that the testimonies
I have alleged relating to this subject, are preferable to
the testimonies of <HI>Talmudkal,</HI> or other later <HI>jewish</HI> wri∣ters.
All the authors I have quoted must be allowed
to have been acquainted with the form of Government
which the <HI>Romans</HI> establishied in their provinces; and
<HI>Josephus</HI> must have known the state of <HI>Judea</HI> in parti∣cular.
And I hope the reader is convinced, that there
is upon this subject a perfect agreement between these
authors and the sacred writers of the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>I shall borrow one passage more from the learned
Doctor: “Christ answers the treachery of the Que∣stion
propounded <HI>(upon the tribute money)</HI> out of the
very determinations of the Schools, where this was
taught; <HI>Wheresoever the money of any King is current,
there the inhabitants acknowledge that King for their
Lord,</HI> Maimon. <HI>on</HI> Gezelah, ch. 5.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Id on <HI>Mttth,</HI> xxii. 20.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THERE remain two or three particulars, which,
not regarding the main point in question, have not yet
been considered: But however may not be quite o∣mitted.</P>
<P>§. XIV. ST. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xviii. 3.] says: <HI>Judas then
having received a</HI> BAND <HI>of men, and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees cometh thither, viz.</HI> to the
garden. <HI>Then the</HI> B A N D, <HI>and the captain,</HI> and officers
of the <HI>jews</HI> took Jesus, [<HI>ver.</HI> 11.] This <HI>band</HI> I sup∣pose
to have consisted of Roman Soldiers. The <HI>Greek</HI>
word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] is, I think, ever used in the <HI>New Te∣stament
<PB N="130" REF="148"/>
stament</HI> concerning Soldiers. <HI>Then the Soldiers of the
Governour took Jesus.</HI>—<HI>And gathered unto him the whole</HI>
BAND <HI>of Soldiers,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 27. Mark xv. 16,
Cornelius, <HI>a centurion of the</HI> Italian <HI>Band,</HI> Acts x. 1.
<HI>See</HI> XXI. 31. XXV11. 1.</P>
<P>FARTHER, when the chief priests and Pharisees
went to <HI>Pilate,</HI> and desired, he would <HI>command that
the Sepu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hre be made sure unto the third day</HI>—<HI>He
said unto them, Ye have a watch</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] <HI>go your
way, make it as sure as ye can,</HI> Matth. xvii. 64, 65,
From whence one would be apt to conclude, that there
was, at lest at the feast times, a guard of Soldiers
upon duty, from which they might draw out a suffi∣cient
number for any particular purpose.</P>
<P><HI>AS they we about to kill him</HI> [Paul] <HI>Tidings came
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</HI> CHIEF CAPTAIN OF THE BAND <HI>that all</HI> Jem∣salem
<HI>was in an uproar: who immediately took Soldiers
and Centurions, and ran down unto them,</HI> Acts xxi. 31,
32. <HI>And he commanded him to be carried into the</HI> CA∣STLE.
<HI>And as</HI> Paul <HI>was to be led into the Castle</HI>—When
the chief captain <HI>had given him license,</HI> Paul <HI>stood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the STAIRS, and there spake unto the people, <HI>ver.</HI>
37—40. And when <HI>Lysias</HI> sent <HI>Paul</HI> from <HI>jerusalem</HI>
to <HI>Cesarea,</HI> it was under a strong guard of horse and
foot, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. 33.</P>
<P>THERE was therefore at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> a Roman offi∣cer,
who had the Government of the Castle, and a
good body of troops under him.</P>
<P>A passage or two from <HI>Josephus</HI> will confirm and
Illustrate these particulars. “<HI>Antonia, says he,</HI> was
situated at the angle of the western and northern
porticoes of the outer Temple, [or outer court of
the Temple]. It was built upon a rock fifty cubits
high, steep on all sides. It was the work of King
<HI>Herod,</HI> in which he had shewn his usual magnifi∣cence.—On that side where it joined to the por∣ticoes
of the Temple, there were STAIRS reaching
to each porticoe, by which the guard descended
for there was always lodged here a Roman Legion)
<PB N="131" REF="149"/>
and posting themselves in their armour in several
places in the porticoes, they kept a watch on the
people on the feast days to prevent all disorders.
For as the Temple was a guard to the City, so was
<HI>Antonia</HI> to the Temple” This from the history of
the <HI>jewish War</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> lib. s. c. s. §. 8.</NOTE>. In his <HI>Antiquities</HI> he says: “ The
feast called the passover approaching, at which it is
our custom to eat unleavened bread, and a great
number of people being come up from all parts to
the feast, <HI>Cumanus</HI> fearing some disturbance com∣manded
a company of Soldiers to post themselves in
their armour in the porticoes of the temple to sup∣press
disorders, if any should happen: which was
what the Procurators had been wont to do at the
feasts<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. xx. c. 4. §. 3.</NOTE>.”. This <HI>Cumanus</HI> was <HI>Felix's</HI> predecessor:
and this order was given, as it seems, A. D. 48.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Critic. in Baron. &amp; Basnage Annal. A. D. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reader must needs observe here two things:
<HI>first,</HI> that there was always a Legion, which kept gar∣rison
in the Castle at <HI>Jerusalem. Secondly,</HI> That at the
Feasts there was a detachment of these Soldiers, which
came down from the Castle, and kept guard in the
porticoes of the temple. It may be questioned what
was <HI>Lysias's</HI> post at <HI>Jerusalem. Grotius</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Praefecto ejus cohortis quae temporibus festis, ac proinde etiam in Pentecoile, praesidium habebat in porticibus templi, ad prohiben<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dos tumultus, si qui orirentur, in Act. xxi. 31.</NOTE> supposed
that he was captain of a cohort that kept guard at the
Feast time. I cannot at present assent to this. It does
not appear to have been Feast time, when <HI>Paul</HI> was
feized (though <HI>Pentecost</HI> was near, <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 6, 16.) It
<PB N="132" REF="150"/>
seems plain to me, that <HI>Lysias</HI> was not upon duty at
the temple at this time. They <HI>laid hands upon</HI> Paul—
<HI>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together:
and they took</HI> Paul, <HI>and drew him out of the temple: and
forthwith the doors were shut. And as they went about
to kill</HI> Paul, <HI>tidings came to the chief captain of the hand,
that all</HI> Jerusalem <HI>was in an uproar,</HI> Ch. xxi. 30-32.
<HI>Who immediately took Soldiers, and centurions, and ran
down unto them.</HI> If <HI>Lysias</HI> had been in the porticoes of
the temple, he would have perceived the disturbance
himself: Whereas he knew nothing of it but by <HI>tidings</HI>
brought to him; and that not till <HI>all</HI> Jerusalem <HI>was
in an uproar.</HI> It is observable also, that <HI>Lysias</HI> after∣ward
summoned the whole council of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The
word<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Phivoninus.</NOTE>, which we render <HI>Band,</HI> is used with consi∣derable
latitude. The word, we have rendered <HI>chief
captain,</HI> signifies properly a captain of a thousand,
and is often used particularly for a tribune. I suppose
therefore, that <HI>Lysias</HI> was the oldest Tribune at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
and that he was the commanding officer at the
castle of <HI>Antonia,</HI> and was intrusted by <HI>Felix</HI> with what
power he thought fit to give to the chief officer under
him at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>§. XV. WE may now proceed to another parti∣cular.
St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. Xviii. 12.] says: <HI>Then the band
and the</HI> CAPTAIN [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] <HI>and officers of the</HI>
Jews <HI>took Jesus and bound him.</HI> I am inclined to think,
the <HI>captain</HI> here mentioned was a <HI>jewish</HI> officer. But I
do not infill upon it. I add therefore two or three o∣ther
texts. And as they spake to the people, the priests
and the CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]
<HI>and the Sadducees came upon them,</HI> Acts iv. 1. <HI>Now
when the high priest, and the</HI> CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE,
<HI>and the chief priests heard these things,</HI> v. 24. <HI>then went
the</HI> CAPTAIN <HI>with the officers,</HI> ver. 26. I believe, most
persons will suppose, that this <HI>captain of the temple</HI> was
a <HI>jewish</HI> officer. There is in <HI>Josepbus</HI> such an officer
mentioned, who is evidently a <HI>Jew.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="151"/>
WHILST the above-named <HI>Cumanus</HI> was procura∣tor
of <HI>Judea,</HI> there happened a dreadful difference be∣tween
the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans. Cumanus</HI> not being
able to put an end to it, <HI>Ummidius Quadratus</HI> president
of <HI>Syria</HI> came into <HI>Judea,</HI> and punished several <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Samaritans</HI> upon the spot, and sent others to <HI>Rome.</HI>
This last part of his conduct is thus expressed by <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
in his <HI>Antiquities:</HI> § Having bound the High
Priest <HI>Ananias</HI> and the CAPTAIN <HI>Ananus</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</NOTE> he
sent them to <HI>Rome</HI> to give an account of their con∣duct
to <HI>Claudius Cesar</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">L. xx. cap. 5. §. 7.</NOTE>. ” In his War of the <HI>Jews</HI>
it is thus: “ And moreover He sent away to <HI>Cesar</HI>
the High Priests <HI>Jonathan</HI> and <HI>Ananias,</HI> and <HI>Ana∣nus</HI>
the Son of this last mentioned<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De Bell. l. ii. cap. 12. §. 6.</NOTE>.” <HI>Ananus,</HI>
who in the former passage has the title of Captain, is
in this latter said to be the son of the high priest.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Josephus</HI> is reckoning up the causes of
offense, which the <HI>Jews</HI> gave the <HI>Romans,</HI> he says:
“ And at the Temple <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Son of <HI>Ananias</HI> the
High Priest, a young man of a bold and resolute
disposition, then CAPTAIN<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J&gt; 2. c. 17. § 2.</NOTE>, perswaded those
who performed the sacred ministrations not to re∣ceive
the gift or sacrifice of any stranger (<HI>or man of
another nation</HI>). This was the foundation of the war
with the <HI>Romans:</HI> for they rejected the sacrifice of
<HI>Cesar</HI> for them. And tho' the high priests and ma∣ny
of the chief men entreated them not to omit the
ancient custom of sacrificing for their governours,
they would not be perswaded; relying upon the
<PB N="134" REF="152"/>
multitude they had on their side,—and especial∣ly
being much at the direction of the Captain <HI>Elea∣zar.”</HI>
Here is another captain, who is a Son of
an High Priest; and he appears to have an authority
ever those, who were in waiting at the temple.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> in one place speaks of the Captains in the
plural number. <HI>Then Jesus said unto the chief priest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and</HI> CAPTAINS<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See upon the place.</NOTE> <HI>of the temple, and the elders which
were come to him,</HI> Luke xxii. 52. As there was a great
variety of ministrarations at the temple, and a great
number of Pried; and Levites always in waiting, but
especially at the Feasts; it is very likely, there was an
officer who presided over each division, and that there
was one who had a command above all the rest.</P>
<P>§. XVI. I have but one thing more to take notice
of here. When St. <HI>Paul</HI> had appealed to <HI>Cesar, Then</HI>
Festus <HI>when he had corsulted with the</HI> COUNCEL, <HI>answer∣ed,
Hast then appealed unto</HI> Cesar? <HI>Unto</HI> Cesar <HI>shalt the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
ge, Acts xxv. 12. The reason of the thing will in∣duce
us to suppose, this was not the <HI>jewish Sanhedrim;</HI>
but some council, which the Governour had with him.</P>
<P>IT was always usual for the Presidents to have a
council consisting of their friends, and other chief <HI>Rn∣mons</HI>
in the province<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. p. 505. E.</NOTE>. <HI>Philo</HI> says, when the <HI>Jews</HI>
waited upon. <HI>Petronius,</HI> and entreated him to deser his
march to <HI>Jerusalam</HI> till they had sent an Embassy to
<HI>Rome, Petrmius</HI> was moved by their tears and lamen∣ntions,
“and consulted with his Assessors what was
proper to be done<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de legat. ad Cai. p. 1027. B.</NOTE>.” <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of <HI>Cuma∣nus</HI>'s
acting “ with the advice of his friends,” in the
Sentence, he pronounced upon a Roman Soldier, who
had tore a book of the Law of <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. lib. xx. cap. 4. §. 4.</NOTE>. In the year
<PB N="135" REF="153"/>
of our Lord 66, <HI>Florus,</HI> who was then Procurator of
<HI>Judea,</HI> sent <HI>Cestius Gallus,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> false ac∣counts
(as <HI>Josephus</HI> says) of the <HI>jewish</HI> behaviour.
“And the chiëf men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were not silent. For
they, and <HI>Berime</HI> wrote to <HI>Cestius</HI> an account of
<HI>Florus</HI>'s male administrations in the City. He there∣fore

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Intend not here a distinct considera∣tion
of the power, or privileges,
which the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed in foreign
countries. Somewhat has been al∣ready
said upon this subject in the
preceding chapter: and more parti∣culars
may be found in the eighth
chapter of this <HI>Book.</HI> I here take notice of a few
things, which fall within the compass of my design,
but are omitted in those other places.</P>
<P>§. I. THERE are frequent intimations in the <HI>New
Testament,</HI> that at the time the Apostles preached the
gospel, after the ascension of our Saviour, there were
great numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> in several parts of the world,
beside those which lived in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the diciples had <HI>been filled with the Holy
Ghost, (on the day of</HI> Pentecost), <HI>and began to speak
with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance,</HI> it is
said: <HI>There were dwelling at</HI> Jerusalem Jews, <HI>devout
men, out of every nation under heaven.—And they were
<PB N="137" REF="155"/>
all amazed, saying one to another, Behold, are not all
these which speak,</HI> Galileans? <HI>And how hear we every
man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</HI> Parthi∣ans,
<HI>and</HI> Medes, <HI>and</HI> Elamites, <HI>and the dwellers in</HI>
Mesopotamia, <HI>and in</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Cappadocia, Pon∣tus
<HI>and</HI> Asia, Phrygia, <HI>and</HI> Pamphylia, <HI>in</HI> Egypt, <HI>and
in the parts of</HI> Lybia <HI>about</HI> Cyrene, <HI>and strangers of</HI>
Rome, Jews <HI>and</HI> Proselytes, Cretes <HI>and</HI> Arabians,
we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works
of <HI>God,</HI> Acts ii. 4.—11.</P>
<P>THE persons spoken of are <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Proselytes,</HI>
chiefly the former. By dwelling at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> must be
understood residing there for a time only; on account
of the Feast, or some other particular occasion. The
word<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. Act. ii. 5.</NOTE> is so used sometimes, and the context obliges
us to understand it so here.</P>
<P>IN the history of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> travels, we find him
preaching in <HI>jewish</HI> Synagogues in many places: when
<HI>Paul</HI> and Barnabas <HI>came to</HI> Antioch <HI>in</HI> Pisidia, <HI>they
went into the Synagogue on the</HI> Sabbath day, <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 14.
They did so likewise at <HI>Iconium,</HI> Ch. xiv. 1. <HI>Paul</HI>
taught in a <HI>Synagogue</HI> at <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> Ch. xvii. 2. at
<HI>Athens,</HI> ver. 17. at <HI>Corinth,</HI> Ch. xviii. 4. at: <HI>Ephesus,</HI>
Ch. xix. 8.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Jews</HI> were scattered abroad, and dwelt
in almost all parts of the world, even before the de∣struction
of their City and State by <HI>Titus,</HI> is evident
from many passages of <HI>Philo, Josephus,</HI> and several
Heathen Authors. I shall select a few of them, which
will be sufficient for the present design.</P>
<P><HI>PHILO,</HI> in his book against <HI>Flaccus,</HI> Prefect of
<HI>Egypt</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Caligula's</HI> reign, says,
“There were not less than a million of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>A∣lexandria</HI>
and other parts of <HI>Egypt</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Kai <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> In Flace. p. 971. C.</NOTE> He adds;
For one country does not contain the <HI>jewish</HI> people,
<PB N="138" REF="156"/>
they being extremely numerous, for which reason
there are of them in all the best and most flourishing
countries of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> in the Islands as well
as on the continents, all esteeming for their metro∣polis
the holy city, in which is the sacred temple of
the most high God<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. E.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P><HI>CALIGULA</HI> had given orders<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">A D 39, or 40.</NOTE> to <HI>Petronius</HI>
President of <HI>Syria,</HI> to erect his Statue at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>
When the tidings that <HI>Petronius</HI> had published these
orders came to <HI>Rome, Agrippa</HI> the elder was there,
He therefore sent the Emperour a Letter (for he was
not then able to appear before him in person) to dis∣swade
him from this design. In this Letter, which
<HI>Philo</HI> has given us an account of, among other thirds
<HI>Agrippa</HI> says: “Nor can I forbear to allege in behalf
of the holy city, the place of my nativity, that it
is the metropolis, not of the country of <HI>Judea</HI> only,
but of many others, on account of the many colo∣nies
that have been sent out of it at different times,
not only into the neighbouring countries, <HI>Egypt,
Phenicia,</HI> both the <HI>Syrias,</HI> but also into places more
distant, to <HI>Pamphylia, Cilicia,</HI> and many parts of
<HI>Asia</HI> as far as <HI>Bithynia,</HI> and the recesses of <HI>Pontus.</HI>
They are in the same manner in <HI>Europe,</HI> in <HI>Thessa∣ly
Bootia, Macedonia, Elolia, Argos, Corinth,</HI> in
the most and best parts of <HI>Peloponnesus.</HI> Nor are
the continents only full of <HI>jewish</HI> colonies, but also
the most celebrated Islands; <HI>Euboea, Cyprus,
Crete:</HI> not to mention those which are beyond the
<HI>Euphrates.</HI> For excepting only a small parr of <HI>Be∣bylon,</HI>
and some other lesser districts, scarce any
country of note can be mentioned, in which there
are not <HI>jewish</HI> inhabitants. If you grant this re∣quest
in favour of my native place, you will be a
<PB N="139" REF="157"/>
benefactor not to one city only, but to thousands
of cities in every part of the world; in <HI>Europe,</HI> in
<HI>Asia,</HI> in <HI>Lybia,</HI> in the maritime and in the inland
parts of the continents and the islands<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: de legat. ad Cai. p. 1031, 1032.</NOTE>.”.</P>
<P>WHEN the war was breaking out in <HI>Judea, Agrippa</HI>
the younger, in a speech he delivered at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
makes use of this as an argument to perswade <HI>jews</HI>
in <HI>Judea</HI> to be peaceable; that if they should be worst∣d,
they would involve their countrymen in other parts
of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> in the same ruine. “You ex∣pose
to danger, <HI>says he,</HI> not only your selves, but
those also who live in other cities: for there is not
a people in all the world, which has not some of
you among them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. l. ii. cap. 16. p. 1089. fin.</NOTE>.”.</P>
<P>§. II. ST <HI>James's</HI> epistle [<HI>Ch,</HI> i. I.] is thus inserib∣ed:
<HI>To the twelve tribes which are scottered abroad greet∣ing:</HI>
by whom, I think, the Apostle intends the be∣lieving
<HI>Jews</HI> of all the twelve tribes, who lived in any
part of the world out of <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. in loc.</NOTE>. For I suppose,
that the two tribes of <HI>Judah,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> were not
entire in <HI>Judea,</HI> but that many of those tribes lived al∣so
in other parts, and that the ten other tribes were
not extinct. <HI>Ptolemee Philadelphus,</HI> having a desire to
enrich his library at <HI>Alexandria</HI> with the <HI>jewish</HI> Law,
wrote to <HI>Eleazar</HI> the High Priest, to send six <HI>Jews</HI>
out of each tribe to make a translation of it for him
into the <HI>Greek</HI> language. In the answer, which <HI>Elea∣zar</HI>
sent to <HI>Ptolemee,</HI> are these words: “ We have
chosen six elders out of each tribe, whom we have
sent to you with the Law<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. lib. xii. c. 2. §. 5.</NOTE>.”. This is a proof,
<PB N="140" REF="158"/>
that <HI>Josephus</HI> (from whom I have taken this account)
did not suppose the ten tribes were extinct.</P>
<P>IN the account of <HI>Ezra's</HI> journey from <HI>Babylon</HI> to
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and of the people that went with him in
the reign of <HI>Artaxerxes, Josephus</HI> is more expresse,
For he says; “But the whole people of the <HI>Israelites</HI>
remained in that country. Whence it has come to
passe, that there are but two tribes subject to the
<HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> But the ten tribes are
still in being beyond the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> an infinite mul∣titude,
whose numbers are not to be known<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. l. xi. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>.”.</P>
<P>§. III. THERE is frequent mention made, in the
<HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> of the <HI>jewish Synagogues</HI> in the
Heathen countries, and of the worship they perform∣ed
in them: but there is somewhat particular in the
description of the place of worship which the <HI>Jews</HI>
had at <HI>Philippi. And on the Sabbath day we went out of
the City by a</HI> RIVER SIDE, <HI>where prayer was wont to be
made,</HI> Acts xvi. 13. There is some difference among
learned men, whether the original word in this place,
which we have rendered <HI>prayer,</HI> should be here under∣stood
of the <HI>act,</HI> or the <HI>place</HI> of prayer<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. I am in∣clined
to think with Doctor <HI>Whitby, Grotius</HI> and others,
that it is a place of worship which is here spoken of,
But what I am chiefly concerned to observe here, a∣greeably
to my design, is, that it may be inferred
from this text, that it was not unusual for the <HI>Jews,</HI>
lest in strange countries, to worship or to erect places
of worship near a RIVER.</P>
<P>THERE is an instance of this kind recorded by <HI>Jo∣sephus,</HI>
who has given us the Decree of the City of
<HI>Halicarnassus</HI> permitting the <HI>Jews</HI> to build oratories;
a part of which Decree runs thus: “ We ordain that
the <HI>Jews,</HI> who are willing, men and women, do
<PB N="141" REF="159"/>
observe the Sabbaths, and perform sacred rites ac∣cording
to the <HI>jewish</HI> laws, and build oratories BY
THE SEA SIDE according to the custorh of their
country; and if any man, whether magistrate or
private person, give them any let or disturbance,
he shall pay a fine to the City<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. Ant. lib. 14. c. 10. §. 24.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AND <HI>Tertullian</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Judaei enim festi, Sabbata, &amp; coena pura,—&amp; jejunia cum azymis, &amp; orationes LITORALES, quae utique aliena sunt à diis vestris. Tertul. ad Nat. lib. 1. cap. 13.</NOTE> among other <HI>jewish</HI> rites and cu∣stoms,
such as Feasts, Sabbaths, Fails, and unlea∣vened
bread, mentions <HI>Shore-Prayers,</HI> that is, prayers
by the <HI>Sea-Side,</HI> or <HI>River-Side.</HI></P>
<P>THESE two passages are sufficient to perswade us,
that it was common for the <HI>Jews</HI> to worship in these
places. But it may be a question, whether this practise
was owing to their choice, or to some necessity laid
upon them by the Heathen Magistrates, to perform
their worship without the gates of their cities.</P>
<P>I shall lay together a sew passages and remarks re∣lating
to this subject.</P>
<P>IT seems to me that <HI>Tertullian</HI> supposed the Shore∣prayers
to be properly a <HI>jewish</HI> custom, since he
reckons them with others that were so. The terms of
the Decree of the people of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> imply the
same thing. And the <HI>Sea side</HI> does not appear to be
mentioned as a restraint or limitation, but as a grant
of a privilege, establishing the <HI>Oratory</HI> in the place
most agreeable to the <HI>Jews. Philo</HI> says, that when
<HI>Flaccus</HI> the prefect of <HI>Egypt</HI> had been taken into custo∣dy
at <HI>Alexandria</HI> by order of <HI>Caligula,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> of∣fered
up thanksgiving to God, spent the whole night
in hymns and Songs, “ and early in the morning
flocking out of the gates of the City they go to the
neighbouring shores, for the [Proseuchae] Orato∣ries
<PB N="142" REF="160"/>
were destroyed; and standingina most pure
place, they lift up their voices with one accord<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Phil. in Flacc. p. 982. D.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>IT is true, their oratories at <HI>Alexandria</HI> were then
all down. But yet methinks here are some signs, that
the <HI>Sea-side</HI> was a place agreeable to them. Why else
did they go out of the city so universally toward the
neighbouring shores, rather than any other way? Be∣sides,
<HI>Philo</HI> expresses much satisfaction in this situati∣on,
when he calls it a <HI>most pure place.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a passage very apposite to this text in the
account <HI>Philo</HI> gives of the annual rejoycings, the <HI>Jews</HI>
were wont to make for the Septuagint Translation,
“ Wherefore, <HI>(says be)</HI> even to this day, there is kept
every year a feast and solemnity in the Isle of <HI>Pha∣ns,</HI>
whither not only the <HI>Jews,</HI> but many others
also cross over, to pay a respect to the place where
this version was first seen.—And after prayers and
thanksgivings, some raise tents on the Shore, others
lay themselves down upon the Sea Sand, in the o∣pen
air, and there feast with their friends and rela∣tion,
ESTEEMING the SHORE more sumptuous than
the furniture of the richest palaces<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> NOMIZONTE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Phil. de vit. Mosis. l. ii. p. 660. A. B.</NOTE>.”.</P>
<P>THESE passages have sometimes inclined me to
think, that the true rendring of this text is thus:
<HI>Where it had been thought fit that the oratory should be;</HI>
implying the <HI>Jews</HI> choice of that situation. But if
any think, that the more natural meaning of the
words is, <HI>Where a hovse of prayer was allowed</HI> or ap∣pointed
<HI>to be by the law;</HI> yet I believe it ought to be
supposed, that this appointment was perfectly agreea∣ble
to the <HI>Jews,</HI> if not owing to their own choice.
<HI>Josephus</HI> having mentioned the privileges bestowed up∣on
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great
says: “ They continued to enjoy the same honour un∣der
<PB N="143" REF="161"/>
his successors, who set apart for them a distinct
place, that they might live in greater purity, than
they could well do, if they were mixed promiscu∣ously
with strangers; and allowed them also to be
called <HI>Macedonians</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. lib. 2. c. 18. §. 7.</NOTE>.” This separating the <HI>Jews</HI>
from other people was no hardship therefore, but a
privilege.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his company, in
their way to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from <HI>Miletus, sailed into</HI> Syria
<HI>and landed at</HI> Tyre. <HI>And finding disciples, we tarried
there seven days—And when we had accomplished those
days, we departed and went our way, and they all brought
us on our way, with wives and children till we were out of
the City: and we kneeled down on</HI> THE SHORE AND
PRAYED, Acts xxi. 3—5. I should have concluded
from this very text, that it was then usual for the
<HI>Jews,</HI> or some other people to pray by the Sea side.
It appears from passages alleged above, that it was a
very common practise among the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>§ IV. WE may now proceed to somewhat else.
<HI>Then there arose certain of the Synagogue which is called
the Synagogue of the</HI> LIBERTINES, <HI>and</HI> Cyrenians, <HI>and</HI>
Alexandrians, <HI>and of them of</HI> Cilicia, <HI>and of</HI> Asia,
<HI>disputing with</HI> Stephen, <HI>Ch.</HI> vi. 9. This Synagogue
of the <HI>Libertines</HI> was at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But it has some
relation to the state of the <HI>Jews</HI> out of their own
country, as will appear presently: and therefore I
consider this particular here.</P>
<P>SOME have made a question, whether there be any
more than one Synagogue here spoken of. Others
think the most natural meaning of the words imports
2s many Synagogues as there are nations, or sorts of
men spoken of. The copulative particle <HI>and</HI> is sup∣posed
a proof of it. If St. <HI>Luke</HI> had intended but
one Synagogue, he would have said, of the Synago∣gue
<PB N="144" REF="162"/>
of the <HI>Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,</HI> &amp;c.
not as he does, of the <HI>Libertines,</HI> and <HI>Cyrenians,</HI> and
<HI>Alexandrians.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>jewish</HI> writers say there were four hundred
and eighty Synagogues in <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Vitring. de Synag. vet. l. i. Part 1. cap. 14. p. 253. vid &amp; Grot. in loc.</NOTE> It is gene∣rally
supposed by learned men, that beside the Syna∣gogues
which belonged to the stated Inhabitants of the
City, the <HI>Jews</HI> of other countries, in which there was
any considerable number of that people, had a Syna∣gogue
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> built at their own cost, together
with a School or Academy adjoining, to which they
might resort for divine worship, when they came to
<HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and where their children might be educa∣ted
and instructed in the perfect knowledge of their
law. The <HI>jewish</HI> authors do expresly mention a Sy∣nagogue,
which the <HI>Alexandrian Jews</HI> had at <HI>Jerusa∣lem.</HI>
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> Heb. &amp; Talm. Exercit. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loc.</NOTE> It is highly probable, the <HI>Jews</HI> of several
other nations had one there likewise.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Libertines</HI> here mentioned seem not to be
so called from any particular country. <HI>Libertinus</HI> or
<HI>Libertine,</HI> is one who had been a slave, but has now
obtained his freedom; or one who is the son of a per∣son
that had been a slave, and was afterward made
free. And it is supposed by several learned men<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot in loc. Pearson. Lection. in Act. Apo. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 7. Vitring. ubi supra. p. 254, 255.</NOTE>
that the <HI>Libertines</HI> here spoken of are <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Prose∣lytes</HI>
of the <HI>jewish</HI> religion, who had been slaves to <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Masters, and had been made free; or the chil∣dren
of such.</P>
<P>THAT these are the Persons here spoken of, will
appear from the following particulars.</P>
<P>THERE was a great number of <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome.
Josephus</HI> says, the ambassy, which came thither from
<HI>Judea</HI> to petition <HI>Augustus,</HI> that <HI>Archelaus</HI> might not
be their King after <HI>Herod,</HI> was joined by above eight
<PB N="145" REF="163"/>
thousand <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ant. Lib xvii. cap. 13. in</NOTE> <HI>Philo</HI> informs us that
the <HI>Jews</HI> who lived at <HI>Rome,</HI> and who occupied a large
quarter of the City,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo de leg. ad Cai. P. 1014. C.</NOTE> where chiefly such as had been

into <HI>Italy,</HI> and were made-free by their Roman Ma∣sters<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. D.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT these <HI>Jews</HI> were called <HI>Libertines</HI> will ap∣pear
plainly from passages of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Josephus,</HI>
and <HI>Suetonius,</HI> in which they speak of the banishment
of the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> in the reign of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> “It
was then resolved also, <HI>says Tacitus,</HI> to expell the
<HI>Egyptian</HI> and <HI>jewish</HI> rites. And a Decree of the Se∣nate
was passed, that four thousand of the <HI>Libertine</HI>
race infected with that superstition, and who were
of a fit age, should be transported into the Island of
<HI>Sardinia,</HI>—and that the rest should depart <HI>Italy</HI>
within a time limited, unless they renounced their
profane rites.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Actum &amp; de sacris AEgyptiis Judacisque pellendis: sactum∣que patrum consultum, ut <HI>quatuor millia libertini generis ea super∣stitione infecti, quis idonea Aetas, insulam Sardiniam veherentur∣ceteri</HI> cederent Italia, nisi certum ante diem profanos ritus exuis∣sent. Tac. Ann. lib. ii. cap. 85.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says of the same affair; “<HI>Tiberius</HI>
ordered that all the <HI>Jews</HI> should be expelled from
<HI>Rome.</HI> And the <HI>Consuls</HI> chose out four thousand
of them, whom they sent into the Island <HI>Sardi∣nia</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. Ant. 1. 18. cap. 4 sin.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>SUETONIUS</HI> says, “That <HI>Tiberius</HI> sent the
<HI>jewish</HI> youth into some of the most unhealthful pro∣vinces,
and ordered the rest of that nation, and
<PB N="146" REF="164"/>
all others of their religion to leave the City, upon
pain of perpetual Servitude<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Judaeorum juventutem, per speciem sacramenti, in provin∣tias gravioris coeli distribuit: reliquos gentis ejusdem, vel similia sectantes urbe submovit, sub poena perpetuae servitutis, nisi obtem. perassent. Seut. Tiber, cap. 36.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> expressly call those,
<HI>Jews,</HI> whom <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls men of the <HI>Libertine race.</HI>

<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> in his second Book against <HI>Apion</HI>
says: “We choose not to imitate the institutions
<PB N="147" REF="165"/>
of other people: But we willingly embrace all that
will follow ours<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Cont. Ap. 1. ii. §. 36.</NOTE>.” But the history which <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ant. Lib. xx. cap. ii.</NOTE> has given us of <HI>Izates</HI> the King of the <HI>Adia∣benes,</HI>
who was converted to the <HI>Jewish</HI> religion about
the fortieth year of the Christian Aera, will throw a
great deal of light upon this subject. And therefore
I shall set it here before the reader, though in as few
words as I can.</P>
<P>“ABOUT this time, <HI>says Josephus, Helene</HI> the
Queen of the <HI>Adiabenes,</HI> and her Son <HI>Izates</HI> came
over to the observation of the <HI>jewish</HI> customs<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ibid. §. 1.</NOTE> It
happened in this manner. <HI>Monobazus</HI> King of the
<HI>Adiabenes</HI> fell in love with his sister <HI>Helene,</HI> and
married her.”—By this marriage he had a Son,
whom he called <HI>Izates.</HI> “But there was an elder son
called <HI>Monobazus,</HI> whom he had by <HI>Helene,</HI> beside
other sons by other wives.” However it was ap∣parent
to all, that <HI>Izates</HI> had his best affections, as if
he had been an only Son. The rest of the sons there∣fore
envied him. The father was sensible of it: “And
therefore, lest any mischief should happen, having
given <HI>Izates</HI> considerable presents, he sent him to
King <HI>Abennerigus,</HI> who resided in a fortresse called
<HI>Spasina,</HI> intrusting him with the care of his Son.
<HI>Abennerigus</HI> received him very civilly, and married
his daughter to him.”</P>
<P>SOME time after this, <HI>Monobazus</HI> the father dies:
The Queen calls a council of the Nobles; puts them
in mind, “That they knew the King her husband
had appointed her Son <HI>Izates</HI> his Successor.” They
came into these measures; <HI>Izates</HI> returned home, was
received, and gained peaceable possession of his fa∣ther's
kingdome.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="166"/>
“BUT whilst <HI>Izates</HI> resided in the fortresse <HI>Spasi∣na</HI>
a <HI>jewish</HI> merchant, whose name was <HI>Ananias,</HI>
who was wont to have accesse to the women of the
court, [or the <HI>King's wives</HI>] taught them to wor∣ship
God according to the <HI>jewish</HI> manner. By their
means <HI>Ananias</HI> was introduced to <HI>Izates,</HI> and
brought over him likewise to the same Sentiments.
—It happened also, that <HI>Helene</HI> was taught by
another <HI>Jew,</HI> and came over to their lawes<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ibid. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Izates</HI> was returned and seated upon the
throne, “understanding that his mother was highly
pleased with the customs of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he became
extremely desirous to enter fully into them. And
understanding, that he could not be a perfect <HI>Jew,</HI>
unless he was circumcised, he was disposed to that
also<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">.<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 5.</NOTE>.” His mother having had notice of these
his intentions, disswaded him from it, fearing it should
alienate his subjes and provoke them to rebell. She
also informed <HI>Ananias,</HI> what advice she had given her
Son. <HI>Ananias</HI> was of the same opinion with her, and
told <HI>Izates,</HI> that if he persisted in this design, he must
necessarily leave him; for the people would impute
this action to him, and it would not be safe for him
to stay any longer in the country. He told him more∣over;
“<HI>That he might worship God without circumcision,
if he did but fully determine to follow the jewish insti∣tutions.
For this was more important [or essentail]
than circumcision</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE> And having assured him that
<PB N="149" REF="167"/>
<HI>God would forgive him his not doing what he declined
only out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects,</HI> the
King for a time submitted to what he said. How∣ever
he had not wholly abandoned his design. And
sometime after this, another <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Eleazar</HI>
coming thither out of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who was reckoned
to be very skilful in the laws, he brought him to
perfect his design. For when he came in to wait
upon the King, he found him reading the law of
<HI>Moses.</HI> And thereupon addressed himself to him in
this manner: <HI>You little think, O King, how great
an injurie you offer to the lawes, and in them to God.
For you ought not only to read the lawes, but in the
first place, to do the things which are enjoined by them.
How long do you remain uncircumcised! If you have
not yet read the Law concerning circumcision, read it
now, that you may know what impiety you are in.</HI> The
King having heard these words, deferred the thing
no longer, but going into another chamber, and
having called in a physician, performed the com∣mandment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE> And then sending for his mother,
and the Maser <HI>Ananias,</HI> he told them, he had now
done the work. They were immediately seised
with an uncommon surprise and fear, lest, if this
matter came to be public, the King should be in
danger of losing his kingdome.—But God suf∣fered
not those things to come to passe which they
feared. For though <HI>Izates</HI> was in many dangers,
God preserved him and his sons, and opened a way
for their safety, when they were encompassed with
difficulties; manifesting<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE> thereby that they who
<PB N="150" REF="168"/>
look up to him, and trust in him alone, do not
lose the fruit of their piety<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">And <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that afterward the King's brother <HI>Mono∣bazus</HI> and many of his relations, observing <HI>Izates,</HI> for his piety to God, belessed above all men, were induced to forsake their own rites and customs, and embrace those of the <HI>Jews.</HI> Antiq. 20. c. 3. §. 1. And several of <HI>Izate's</HI> sons and brothers were within <HI>Jerusalem</HI> during the siege: and when the city was taken, fell into the hands of <HI>Titus;</HI> who out of his great generosity gave them their lives, but put them in chains, and carried them bound to <HI>Rome</HI> de Bell. lib. vi. cap. 6. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS story may give occasion for many reflexions.
I put the reader in mind of some of them only. We
learn hence, that the <HI>Jews</HI> did sometimes gain over
persons of distinction to their religion: We see here,
in part, their methods of gaining Proselytes: here ap∣pear
two distinct sentiments; <HI>Ananias</HI> did not abso∣lutely insist upon circumcision, but <HI>Eleazar</HI> did. And
it seems somewhat probable, that <HI>Josephus</HI> himself was
on this side the question. <HI>Ananias</HI> dispensed with it,
only on account of a very great necessity: <HI>Eleazar</HI> is
represented as most skilful in the laws: and in the
conclusion, <HI>Josephus</HI> intimates, that <HI>Izates,</HI> by em∣bracing
circumcision, had intitled himself to the spe∣cial protection of providence.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has expressly called <HI>Nicolas</HI> a proselyte
of <HI>Antioch.</HI> I must therefore set down here one passage
particularly for his sake. <HI>Josephus,</HI> speaking of
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> says: “They were continually
bringing over a great number of <HI>Greeks</HI> to their
religion. They made them also in some measure
a part of themselves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. lib. 7. cap. 3. §</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has more than once spoke of women
among the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who were worshippers of God
When <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Philippi,</HI> he says: <HI>And a certain
certain woman named</HI> Lydia, <HI>a seller of purple, of the city of</HI>
Thyatira,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>which</HI> WORSHIPPED <HI>God, heard us, Acts</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="169"/>
xvi. 14. At <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Pisidia, The</HI> Jews <HI>stirred up
the</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> DEVOUT <HI>and honourable women,—and raised
persecution against</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas, <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 50.
From the history I have just now given of <HI>Izates's</HI> con∣version,
it appears, that some women were brought
to <HI>approve of the jewish customs,</HI> and to <HI>worship God
after the manner of the</HI> Jews. <HI>Josephus</HI> says moreover,
that when the men of <HI>Damascus</HI> [in the year 66.] had
formed a design to make away with all the <HI>Jews</HI> of
that place, “They concealed their design very care∣fully from their wives; because all of them, ex∣cept
a very few, were devoted to the <HI>jewish</HI> reli∣gion
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 20. §. 2.</NOTE>”
It appears from a verse in <HI>Horace</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">—Ac veluti te Judaei cogemus in hanc concedere turbam. lib. i. sat, iv, v. ult.</NOTE>
that the <HI>jewish</HI> zeal in making proselytes was very ex∣traordinary,
and much taken notice of.</P>

<P>§I. <SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>ROM the frequent mention of the

and <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> it is natural
to conclude, that they were the pre∣vailing
Sects among the <HI>Jews</HI> at that
time. This is agreeable to the accounts, which <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. ii. cap. 8. §. 14. Antiq. 18. c. 1. §. 2. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> has given of the <HI>jewish</HI> Sects: and will be evi∣dent
from the particulars, which will be taken notice
of presently.</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Pharisees, Josephus says,</HI> were reckoned
the most religious of any of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to be the
most exact and skilful in explaining the laws<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. l. i. cap. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>”.
In which he concurs with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who says: <HI>After
the straitest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee, Acts</HI>
xxvi. 5. There is an agreement not only in the sense,
but also in the expression<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> vid. &amp; Joseph. in vit. §. 38. p. 923.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="171"/>
ST. <HI>Mark</HI> [Ch. viii. 3, 4.] says, <HI>That the</HI> Phari∣sees,
<HI>and all the</HI> Jews, <HI>except they wash, eat not, hold∣ing the tradition of the elders: and many other things there
be which they have received to hold.</HI> And there is in the
Gospels frequent mention of the traditions of the el∣ders.
<HI>Josephus</HI> says, “The <HI>Pharisees</HI> have delivered
to the people many institutions as received from the
fathers, which are not written in the laws of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 13. c. 10. §. 6.</NOTE>.” Whereas St. <HI>Mark</HI> says, <HI>The Pharisees,</HI> and
ALL THE JEWS, <HI>except they wash, eat not;</HI> his expressi∣ons
are extremely just. For <HI>Josephus</HI> adds, almost
immediately after the words just now cited from him,
“That the <HI>Sadducees</HI> were able to draw over to them
the rich only, the people not following them: for
the multitude was with the <HI>Pharisees</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>IN many parts of the Gospels, and especially in the
prosecution of our Saviour before <HI>Pilate,</HI> the common
people appear to have been very much at the devotion
of the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> It is evident from what has been al∣ready
alledged here from <HI>Josephus,</HI> than the people
were usually on their side. He has said the same thing
in other places. “They had (<HI>says he</HI>) such an influ∣ence
on the multitude, that if they gave out any
thing agajnst a King or an High Priest, they were
credited<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 5.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Evangelists, they affected the
direction of publick affairs; and very much abused
the credulity of the people, and the reputation they
had for sanctity. They <HI>loved salutations in the market
places, and the</HI> chief <HI>seats in the Synagogues, and the
<PB N="154" REF="172"/>
uppermost rooms at feasts, devoured widows houses, and
for a pretence made long prayers,</HI> Mat. xxiii. 14. Mark
xii. 38—40. Luke xx. 46, 47.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Josephus</HI> allows they did sometimes make an
ill use of the esteem they were in for piety. <HI>Alexan∣dra,</HI>
the widow of <HI>Alexander Janneus,</HI> had for some
time the government of <HI>Judea.</HI> She being a “<HI>ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry
religious woman”</HI> thought the <HI>Pharisees</HI> might be
her best Counsellors, but “they abusing her simpli∣city
in this respect”, though on other accounts she
was a woman of very good capacity, “got the ma∣nagement
of all things into their own hands, con∣demned
or acquitted, punished or rewarded men
according to their own pleasure; in a word, she
governed other, the <HI>Pharisees</HI> governed her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. lib. i. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> are plainly represented
in the Gospels as very different from each other, and
holding in a manner opposite opinions. <HI>Josephus</HI> in
one place calls the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> “the Sect opposite to
that of the <HI>Pharisees</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. lib. xiii. c. 10 §. 6. in.</NOTE>.” They did at some times
join together in one and the same design against our
Saviour. <HI>The</HI> Pharisees <HI>also with the</HI> Sadducees, <HI>came,
and tempting him, desired him that he would show them a
sign from Heaven,</HI> Mat. xvi. 1. At other times they
attacked him separately, and endeavoured to ensnare,
or puzzle him with Queries suitable to their several
schemes, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii. 23—34. We have one instance,
wherein their different principles drove them into very
different measures, and occasioned a downright quar∣rel.
When St. <HI>Paul</HI> was called before the council at
<HI>Jerusalem, and perceived that the one part Were</HI> Saddu∣cees
<HI>and the other</HI> Pharisees, <HI>he cried out in the council,
<PB N="155" REF="173"/>
Men and Brethren,</HI> I am a <HI>Pharisee—Of the hope
and resurrection of the dead, I am called in question. And
when he had so said, there arose a dissention between them:
—for the</HI> Sadducees <HI>say that there is no resurrection,
neither angel nor spirit: but the</HI> Pharisees <HI>confess both:
And there arose a great cry—And when there arose a
great dissention, the chief captain, fearing least</HI> Paul
should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the
soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among
them, and to bring him into the <HI>castle,</HI> Acts xxiii. 6.—10.</P>
<P>THIS will lead us to the consideration of some of
their distinguishing tenets. I shall therefore set down
now the account <HI>Josephus</HI> has given of their opinions
concerning the points mentioned in this text. Of the
<HI>Pharisees</HI> he says: “Moreover it is their belief, that
there is an immortal power in souls, and that under
the earth there are rewards and punishments for
those who in this life have practised virtue or vice;
and that to these [<HI>souls</HI>] there is appointed an eter∣nal
prison, but that to the former there is a power
of reviving<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Illis verò facultatem esse in vitam redeundi. vers. Huds. Antiq. lib. 18. c. 1. §. 3.</NOTE>.” In another place he says of
them; That they believe every soul to be immortal,
but that the soul of the good only passes into ano∣ther
body, and the soul of the wicked is punished
with eternal punishment<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. lib. ii. c. 8. §. 14.</NOTE>” On the other hand
he says: “It is the opinion of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> that
souls perish with the bodies<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. lib. 18. c. 1. §. 4.</NOTE>. And in another
place, “that they deny the continuance of souls, and
the punishments and rewards of <HI>Hades</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. ubi supra.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="174"/>
IT has been thought by some<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. in Matt. xiv. 2. xxii. 28. Clerie. Hist. Ec. Pro∣legom. §. 1. c. 2.</NOTE> that <HI>Josephus,</HI> in
this account of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> has endeavoured to ac∣commodate
their sentiments to those of some of the
<HI>Greek</HI> Philosophers; and that he here represents them
as believing something very much like the <HI>Pythago∣rean</HI>
transmigration of souls. And there seem to be
in the <HI>New Testament</HI> the traces of some such senti∣ment;
particularly in some of the instances mentioned,
<HI>Matth.</HI> xvi. 14. <HI>And they said, some say, that thou art</HI>
John <HI>the</HI> Baptist, <HI>some</HI> Elias, <HI>and others</HI> Jeremias, <HI>or
one of the prophets.</HI>—Again it is said: <HI>His disciples asked
him, saying, master, who did sin,</HI> THIS MAN <HI>or his
pa∣rents,</HI>
THAT HE WAS BORN BLIND? <HI>John</HI> ix. 2.</P>
<P>SOME<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Basnage. Ann. Pol. Ecc. A. D. i. n. 12.</NOTE> think that <HI>Josephus's</HI> words above-men∣tioned
are altogether inconsistent with the notion of a
transmigration, and that they import the belief of a
proper resurrection. Possibly there were different sen∣timents
concerning this matter among those called
<HI>Pharisees.</HI> It may be they had none of them exactly
that notion of a future state and a resurrection, which
our Lord, and his Apostles after him, taught: for
St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, that <HI>Jesus Christ had brought life and im∣mortality
to light through the Gospel,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 10.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, St. <HI>Paul's</HI> notions did directly contra∣dict
those of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and favour and confirm,
not to say, improve those of the <HI>Pharisees;</HI> as is evi∣dent
from <HI>Josephus's</HI> account. And it is not at all
wonderful, that one Sect laid hold of an advantage
against the other.</P>
<P>WITHOUT staying any longer here, I shall give
a passage or two, in which <HI>Josephus,</HI> who was of the
Sect of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> has represented some of his own
sentiments concerning these points. The city of <HI>Jota∣pata,</HI>
where <HI>Josephus</HI> commanded, was now taken;
and he and some others had hid themselves in a cave.
He was for surrendering to <HI>Vespasian;</HI> the rest of the
<PB N="157" REF="175"/>
company were rather for killing themselves, and
threatned to kill him, if he did not come into the same
sentiment. In order to disswade them from this de∣sign,
among other things, he says: “All have mor∣tal
bodies, formed of corruptible matter. But the
soul is immortal, and being a portion of God is
housed in bodies.—What! know you not, that
they who depart out of life according to the lawe of
nature, and return to God the debt they have re∣ceived
from him, when it is the will of him that
gave it, have eternal praise, and durable houses
and generations; and that pure and obedient souls
remain, having received an holy place in heaven,
from whence, after the revolution of ages they shall
be again housed in pure bodies. But the souls of
those who have laid violent hands on themselves
shall be lodged in the darkest <HI>Hades</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. lib. iii. c. 7. p. 1144, 1145.</NOTE>.” If I
mistake not, St. <HI>Paul's</HI> figures in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 1, 2. have
a resemblance with these of <HI>Josephus. For we know,
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
we have a building of God, an house not made with hands
eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan earnestly,
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from
heaven.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Pharisees</HI> are said in the Gospels <HI>to fast oft:
Mat.</HI> ix. 14. and <HI>Josephus</HI> says, “They practise great
temperance, and never indulge themselves in a luxu∣rious
way of life<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. 18. c. 1. §. 3.</NOTE>” This is as much as is rea∣sonable
<PB N="158" REF="176"/>
to expect from him. It was not proper to tell
all the world that they <HI>fasted twice in a week,</HI> [Luke
xviii. 12.] from sunset to sunset<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Buxt. Synag. Jud. cap. 30.</NOTE> The <HI>Jews</HI> fasting
was one of those things which the <HI>Romans</HI> had always
ridiculed<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jejunia Sabbatariorum, Mart. 1. iv. Epigr. 4.</NOTE> And some thought they fasted on their
Sabbaths<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ne Judaeus quidem, mi Titeri, tam diligenter Sabbati jeju nium servat quam ego hodie servavi. Suet. August. cap. 76.</NOTE>; though this was a great mistake. <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
however, cannot be much blamed for endeavour∣ing
to give a good turn to what had been a foundation
for many unlucky jests.</P>
<P>I don't remember that the Evangelists have any
where said expresly, that the <HI>Sadducees</HI> rejected the <HI>tra∣dition
of the Elders;</HI> but as these were the great con∣cern
of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and as these two sects seem op∣posite
to each other, I should think it very likely even
from the <HI>New Testament,</HI> that the <HI>Sadducees</HI> were not
very fond of these traditions: and <HI>Josephus</HI> saies it
plainly. “The <HI>Pharisees</HI> have delivered to the peo∣ple
many institutions as received from the fathers,
which are not written in the laws of <HI>Moses.</HI> For
this reason the <HI>Sadducees</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 13. c. 10. §. 6.</NOTE> reject these things, say∣ing,
that those things are binding which are written,
but that the things received by tradition from the
fathers need not to be observed. And about these
things there have happened many disputes and con∣tentions.”
And again: “They pretend not to

§ II. BUT though these two scts stood thus, in a
manner in opposition to each other; yet St. <HI>Luke</HI> re∣presents
them both as concerned together in that admi∣nistration
of affairs, which was allowed the <HI>jewish</HI> nation
by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to whom they were then subject: and
says, that the members of the council, before which
St. <HI>Paul</HI> was brought, were <HI>the one part</HI> Sadducees, <HI>and
the other Pharisees,</HI> [Acts xxiii. 6.] And we have, be∣fore
this, mention made of a council, in which there
was a good number of <HI>Sadducees: Then the high priest
rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect
of the</HI> Sadducees <HI>Ch.</HI> v. 17.</P>
<P>AND there is no reason to suspect that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
been mistaken herein. The <HI>Sadducees</HI> were not exclud∣ed
from publick offices: but in proportion to their
numbers seem to have had an equal share in the admi∣nistration
with the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> But the reader is to
judge for himself from what <HI>Josephus</HI> says. “This
opinion (<HI>speaking of the Sadducees</HI>) is imbraced by a
few only; but then they are some of the chief men
for dignity: However, they can do but little; for
when they are in the magistracy, they generally fall
into the measures of the <HI>Pharisees</HI>(though unwil∣lingly,
and out of pure necessity) for otherwise
they would not be induredby the multitude<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid.</NOTE>.”
He says likewise, “That they are the most cruel of
all the <HI>Jews</HI> in their judicial sentences<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ant. 20. c. 8. p. 896. v. 37.</NOTE>”, which
I think does appear also in some instances in the <HI>Acts of
the Apostles;</HI> where the <HI>Pharisees</HI> were for the milder
sentence, and had a majority. However, these pas∣sages
of <HI>Josephus</HI> plainly intimate, that the <HI>Sadducees</HI>
were not seldom in office.</P>
<P>THE High Priests themselves were sometimes <HI>Sad∣ducees.
John Hyrcanus,</HI> Prince and High Priest of
<PB N="l60" REF="178"/>
the <HI>Jews,</HI> who died in the year 107. before the Chri∣stian
Aera<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prideaux Connect. Part II. Book iv. p. 328.</NOTE> sorsook the <HI>Pharisees</HI> upon a disgust,
and turned <HI>Sadducee.</HI> “He abrogated the Institu∣tions
which the <HI>Pharisees</HI> had prescribed to the peo∣ple,
and punished those that observed them. Hence
the multitude conceived an aversion for him and his
sons.—But having suppressed this disturbance, he
afterwards lived very happily; and having admini∣stred
the government in an excellent manner one
and thirty years, he died, leaving behind him five
sons<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 1. 13. c. 10. §. 6, 7.</NOTE>.” There was another instance of this
about the year of our Lord 60<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Crit. in Bar. &amp; Basnage An. P. E.</NOTE>. “Cesar, having
heard of the death of <HI>Festus,</HI> sent <HI>Albinus</HI> Prefect in∣to
<HI>Judea;</HI> and the King [<HI>sc. Agrippa the younger</HI>]
took away the High Priesthood from <HI>Joseph,</HI> and
gave the succession of that office to <HI>Ananus</HI> the son
of <HI>Ananus—</HI> This <HI>Ananus</HI> the younger, who, as
we said just now, had received the High Priest∣hood,
was fierce and haughty in his behaviour, and
above all men bold and daring. And moreover
was of the sect of the <HI>Sadducees</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. l. 20. c. 8. §. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>MANY do suppose, that the High Priest, whom
St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 17. as being of the sect of
the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> was <HI>Caiaphas.</HI> But <HI>Josephus</HI> has said
nothing concerning <HI>Caiaphas</HI>'s principles, one way
or other.</P>
<P>WE may, as we pass along, observe here the agree∣ment between the stile of the Evangelists and <HI>Josephus</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="179"/>
The <HI>people,</HI> as is evident, very generally held the te∣nets,
and observed the traditions of the <HI>Pharisees:</HI> yet
they are never dignified so far, as to be called <HI>Phari∣sees.</HI>
They are rather an appendage than a part of the
sect: and are always called very plainly <HI>the people, the
multitude,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>AGAIN, St. <HI>Mark</HI> introduces our Saviour telling the
<HI>Pharisees: Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
that ye may keep your own tradition,</HI> Mark vii. 9. So
that in one respect a tradition might be <HI>the Fathers,</HI> and
in another the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> And afterward: <HI>Making the
Word of God of none effect through your tradition, which</HI>
YE HAVE DELIVERED, <HI>ver.</HI> 13. And to add no more
texts: <HI>They</HI> (the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees) bind heavy
burdens and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens
shoulders,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 4. Luke xi. 46. Here also
the phrase and sense of the Evangelists and <HI>Josephus</HI>
agree together. In one of the passages just transcrib∣ed
from him he says: <HI>The</HI> Pharisees <HI>have</HI> DELIVERED
<HI>to the people many institutions:</HI> in another, he speaks of
the institutions, which the <HI>Pharisees</HI> had <HI>prescribed</HI> to,
or enjoined upon <HI>the people.</HI></P>
<P>§ III. THERE is in the Gospels frequent mention
of a set of men called <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Lawyers.</HI> They are
often joined with the chief priests, elders, and <HI>Phari∣sees.</HI>
They seem to have been men of skill and learning,
and to have had a particular deference paid to them on
that account. <HI>And when he had gathered all the chief
Priests and Scribes of the people together, he demanded
of them where Christ should be born?—</HI> Matth. ii. 4.
<HI>For he taught them as one having authority and not as
the Scribes,</HI> Ch. vii. 39. A passage or two of <HI>Josephus</HI>
will explain these mens characters.</P>
<P>WHILST he (<HI>sc. Herod</HI> in his last sicknesse)
lay under these disorders, there happened a tumult
among the people. There were in the City two
Sophists [or Rabbies] who were reckoned exceed∣ing
skilful in the lawes of their country, and for
that reason were highly honoured throughout the
<PB N="162" REF="180"/>
whole nation, <HI>Judas</HI> the son of <HI>Sepphoraeus,</HI> and
<HI>Matthias</HI> the son of <HI>Margalus.</HI> Not a few of the
young men frequented them to hear them interpret
the lawes, and they had with them every day an
army of the youth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. de B. J. lib. i. cap. 33. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>OF this same astair he speaks thus in <HI>his Antiquities.</HI>
There were <HI>Judas</HI> the son of <HI>Sariphaeus,</HI> and <HI>Mat∣thias</HI>
the son of <HI>Margalothus,</HI> men who had the
most perswasive eloquence of any among the <HI>Jews,</HI>
and were eminent Interpreters of the lawes, and
were dear to the people, because they taught the
youth. These were daily frequented by those who
gave themselves to the study of virtue<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 6. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHETHER there be any difference between <HI>Law∣yers</HI>
and <HI>Scribes,</HI> or whether they are words perfectly
synonymous, I cannot say. Perhaps some were chief∣ly employed in the Schools, and others usually spoke
in public in the Synagogues.</P>
<P>§ IV. IT ought to be observed that <HI>Josephus</HI> has
given an account of a third sect: among the <HI>Jews,</HI>
which were called <HI>Essenes:</HI> and on the other hand there
is a sort of men spoken of in the Gospels, of which
<HI>Josephus</HI> has taken no notice, namely the <HI>Herodians.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Herodians,</HI> they (or their leaven) are
not often mentioned in the <HI>New Testament:</HI> I think not
above four times in all the Gospels, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxii. 16.
<HI>Mark</HI> iii. 6. viii. 15. xii. 13. What their particular
tenets were, does not appear to me: and I suppose it
is not necessary I should set down here all the conjec∣tures
<PB N="163" REF="181"/>
of learned men concerning them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. St. Hieron. Matth. xxii. 15, 16. Prid. Conn. Part ii. Book v. Reland. ant. Heb. p. 242, 263. Clerici Prolegom: ad Hist. Ecc. p. 15.</NOTE> They
might be a subdivision, or branch of one of the other
sects, either of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> or <HI>Sadducees:</HI> or if they
were properly a distinct sect from the rest, it might
be a character that subsisted but a short time, at lest
under that name. From the time that prophecy cea∣sed among the <HI>Jews,</HI>
new sects were continually ari∣sing.
There were two disciples of <HI>Antigonus Sochaeus,</HI>
that were the Authors of two new sects: <HI>Sadoc,</HI> of the
sect of the <HI>Sadducees; Baithos</HI> or <HI>Bathus,</HI> the author
likewise of a new sect, which had its name from him,
and which is mentioned in the <HI>Gemara</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid Reland. ubi supra p. 262.</NOTE> though not
in <HI>Josephus.</HI> There was likewise at this time a division
in the sect of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> some following <HI>Hillel,</HI> and
others <HI>Shammai.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> Connect. Part ii. Book viii. at the beginning</NOTE> The followers of <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI>
were at first but a small portion of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> in
time they swallowed up almost all the other parties.
<HI>Josephus,</HI> who so often says, that the sects of the <HI>Jews</HI>
are three, once or twice calls <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> the
Leader or head of a fourth sect<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. xvii, P. 794. in.</NOTE> The reason of
his not always distinguishing these from the rest was,
I imagine, because they differed from the <HI>Pharisees,</HI>
only in some few particulars. So that one and the
same writer, who has professedly reckoned up the
<HI>Jewish</HI> sects, according to different ways of considering
them, makes sometimes more, and sometimes fewer:
much more may two different writers, though they
write professedly of this matter; which the Evan∣gelists
have not done.</P>
<P>AND after all, perhaps, these <HI>Herodians</HI> were never
properly a distinct sect. Mr. <HI>Basnage,</HI> and<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Poli Synops. Matth. xxii. 16</NOTE> others
suppose they were some of the officers of <HI>Herod Tetrarch</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="182"/>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> which came up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the Feasts,
and who were more devoted to the interests of the Em∣perour
than some of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and therefore the
<HI>Pharisees</HI> perswaded some of them to go along with
their own disciples, when they sent them to our Sa∣viour
with the question concerning the lawfulness of
tribute. Their <HI>leaven</HI> might comprize several things,
Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI> supposes that one thing, meant by it,
might be a conformity to Roman customs in some
points which were forbidden the <HI>Jews</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Vid. Basnage Ann. Polit. Ecc. Vol. I. p. 293. n. 5. p. 318. n. 16. &amp; passim</NOTE> If this
was the case, it is not strange that they are not par∣ticularly
mentioned by <HI>Josephus</HI> among the <HI>jewish</HI>
sects.</P>
<P>§. V. As for the <HI>Essenes</HI> not being mentioned by
the Evangelists; it was not their design to write the
history of the <HI>jewish</HI> sects, but of our Saviour's mini∣stry.
And it is likely this did not lead them to take
any particular notice of them. They were not very
numerous. <HI>Josephus</HI> computes their number at about
four thousand; but I think, he means only those of
them that entirely rejected marriage<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. 793.</NOTE> <HI>Philo</HI> says,
that in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Palestine</HI> there were about four thou∣sand
of them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Quod omnis probus liber, <HI>p.</HI> 876. <HI>C. D.</HI></NOTE>. As they were not very numerous,
so they liv'd very retired. <HI>Philo</HI> says they sacrificed
no living creatures, and that they shunned cities<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">'Ou <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE>
<HI>Josephus</HI> says, they sent presents to the temple, but

which they lived<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kai</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 8. p. 1061. v. 25.</NOTE> In order to be admitted among

four classes, according to the time of their ini∣tiation.

inferior than the elder, that if any of these do but
touch one of a junior class, they wash themselves,
just as they would do if they had conversed with, a
stranger of another nation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. p. 1063. v. 32.—34.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Is it any wonder, that the Evangelists had no par∣ticular
occasion to mention this private set of men in
writing the life of our Saviour? <HI>The High Priest then
asked Jesus, of his disciples and of his doctrine. Jesus
answered him; 1 spake openly to the world, I ever taught
in the Synagogue, and the temple, whither the</HI> Jews <HI>al∣ways
resort: and in secret have I said nothing,</HI> John
xviii. 19. 20. This is one of the glories of our Savi∣our's character, as it is our very great happinesse,
that what he said and did was public. These men
would not come to him; and it would have been a
disparagement for him to have gone to them. It is,
I think, a just observation of Dr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> “that
almost all that is peculiar in this sect, is condemn∣ed
by Christ and his Apostles<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Connect. Part II. Book v. p 364.</NOTE>.” And this is
sufficient for us.</P>
<P>§. VI. WE may not improperly subjoin the <HI>Sama∣ritans</HI>
to the <HI>jewish</HI> Sects.</P>
<P>IN the discourse that passed between our Saviour
and the woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> she tells him, <HI>our fathers
worshipped in this mountain,</HI> John iv. 20 And <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
saies that “mount <HI>Garizim</HI>(the same the wo∣man
here speaks of) is by them esteemed the most
sacred of all mountains<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 18. c. 5. § I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="184"/>
<HI>THE</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Samaritans <HI>appear to have had a
very great aversion and contempt for each other.</HI>
Then cometh he to a city of <HI>Samaria.</HI> Now <HI>Jacob</HI>'s well
was there. There cometh a woman to draw water,
Jesus saith unto her give me to drink. For his disciples
were gone away unto the city to buy meat. Then saith
the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> unto him, How is it, that thou,
being a <HI>Jew,</HI> askest drink of me which am a woman of
<HI>Samaria?</HI> for the <HI>Jews</HI> have no dealings<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cuthaei Caesarienses interrogaverunt</HI> R. Ahbuc.

<HI>Samaritans,</HI> John iv. 5—9.</P>
<P>IT seems that the <HI>Jews</HI> were wont to take up provi∣sions
at their own cost of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> as they past
through their country; and therefore the Disciples
made no scruple to go into the city to buy what they
wanted. And it is likely, that as <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Samaria</HI>
were now both under one and the same government,
namely that of the <HI>Romans;</HI> there was so good order
preserved, that necessary accommodations should not
be ordinarily refused any travellers, upon their paying
the full value of them. But these people scorned to
ask, or receive a favour of each other, even so small
a kindness as a draught of water. Our Lord did not
think himself bound by the rules they followed, as he
was not moved by the passions, with which they were
possessed. But this <HI>woman</HI> was not a little surprized,
that <HI>He, being a</HI> Jew, <HI>should ask drink of her that was
a</HI> Samaritan.</P>
<P>THEY all knew how they stood affected to each
other. The enmity betwixt them must have been the
greatest that can be conceived. Doubtless those <HI>Jews</HI>
gave our Saviour the most opprobrious language
which the most furious resentment could suggest, when
<HI>they said unto him, Say we not well, that thou art a</HI> Sa∣maritan,
<HI>and hast a Devil?</HI> John viii. 48.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="185"/>
IT is certain the annimosity between these people
had ever been very great, and new affronts and inju∣ries
had increased it about this time. <HI>Josephus</HI> has re∣lated
a particular provocation which the <HI>Samaritans</HI>
gave the <HI>Jews,</HI> A. D. 8, or 9.</P>
<P>“WHEN <HI>Coponius</HI> governed in <HI>Judea,</HI> an affair
happened, that deserves to be mentioned. At the
Feast of unleavened bread, which we call the passo∣ver,
it was the custom of the Priests to set open
the gates of the Temple at midnight. Soon after
they had been opened, some <HI>Samaritans,</HI> who had
come privately into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> entered in and
threw dead mens bones in the porticoes; for
which reason the Priests ever after guarded the
Temple more strictly<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 18. c. 2. § 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE conversation which our Lord had with the
woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> happened as he was going from <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI>
to <HI>Galilee. He left</HI> Judea, <HI>and departed again in∣to</HI>
Galilee. <HI>And he must needs go through</HI> Samaria, <HI>John</HI>
iv. 3, 4. And St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given us an account of an
affront our Saviour met with in that country at another
time, when he was passing through it to one of the
Feasts at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> This may incline us to suppose,
that as this was the shortest way; so it was usual for
the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> to go this way up to their Feasts.
<HI>Josephus</HI> has assured us it was so. The story in which
this is mentioned being remarkable, I shall set it down
at length. The fact happened about the year of our
Lord 52<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. Cleric. Histor. Eccl.</NOTE></P>
<P>“MOREOVER a difference arose between the <HI>Sa∣maritans</HI>
and the <HI>Jews</HI> upon this occasion. It was
the custom of the <HI>Galileans,</HI> who went up to the
<PB N="168" REF="186"/>
holy city at the Feasts, to travel through the coun∣try
of <HI>Samaria.</HI> As they were in their journey,
some of the village called <HI>Ginaea,</HI> which lies on the
borders of <HI>Samaria</HI> and the great plain, falling up∣on
them killed a great many of them. When the
chief men of <HI>Galilee</HI> heard what had been done,
they went to <HI>Cumanus,</HI> (he was then Procurator)
and desired, that he would revenge the death of
those men that had been kill'd. But he having been
bribed by the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> paied no regard to
them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Antiq. lib. 20. cap. 5. §. I. Vid. &amp; de Bell. lib, 2. cap. 12. §. 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS passage gives light to what is said, St. <HI>Luke</HI>
ix. 51.—<HI>And it came to pass, when the time was come
that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to
go up to</HI> Jerusalem. <HI>And sent messengers before his face,
and they went, and entered into a village of the</HI> Samari∣tans
<HI>to make ready for him. And they did not receive
him, because his face was, as though he would go up to
Jerusalem.</HI> It was upon this people, that some of our
Saviour's disciples were for commanding fire to <HI>come
down from Heaven to consume them.</HI> Our Blessed Lord
rebuked his disciples; but it is evident both from the
Evangelists and <HI>Josephus,</HI> that however this people
might treat other travellers, or even <HI>Jews</HI> at other
times; they were very apt to violate the common
lawes of civility and hospitality toward those that were
going to worship God at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or that had been
there upon that account.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">I. The Jews had expectations of the Messiah, as a
temporal deliverer. II. Of the Jews requiring a

IV. The Jews and Samaritans supposed the Messiah
to be a Prophet as well as a King. V. Some
reflexions.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>WO things are plainly intimated
by the Evangelists; that the <HI>jewish</HI>
nation had, about the time of our
Saviour, very general expectations
of the coming of the Messiah; and
that the Idea they formed of him,
was that of a powerful and victorious temporal
Prince.</P>
<P>First, <HI>IT is intimated that they had very general ex∣pectations
of the Messiah.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> sent Priests and
Levites from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to ask him (sc. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap∣tist</HI>)
who art thou? and he confessed and denied not: but
confessed I am not the Christ. And they asked him, what
then?—and they which were sent were of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI>
John <HI>i.</HI> 19.—24. And as the people were in expectation,
and all men mused in their hearts of <HI>John,</HI> whether he
were the Christ or not, <HI>Luke iii.</HI> 15. Ch. <HI>ii.</HI> 25, 26.
<HI>John iv.</HI> 25.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is intimated, that the Idea the <HI>Jews</HI>
then had of the Messiah, was that of a powerful tem∣poral
Prince. The Disciples of Christ had these ap∣prehensions;
therefore there <HI>arose a reasoning among
<PB N="170" REF="188"/>
them, which of them should be greatest,</HI> Luke ix. 46.
This notion was the ground of that petition presented
to our Saviour by the mother of <HI>Zebedees</HI> children:
<HI>Grant that these my two Sons may sit, the one on the right
hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdome,</HI> Matt.
xx. 21.</P>
<P>THE common people, whenever they had formed
a great Idea of Jesus, from what he said or performed,
continually betrayed expectations of his assuming some
external marks of Royalty, and very forwardly offer
him their service, <HI>John</HI> vi. 14, 15. This was the in∣tention
of those acclamations they made, and of that
solemn state, with which they attended him at last into
<HI>Jerusalem;</HI> the circumstances of which are related by
all the four Evangelists: <HI>And a very great multitude
spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches
from the trees and strewed them in the way; and the mul∣titude
that went before, and that followed, cried, saying,</HI>
HoHHsanna <HI>to the Son of</HI> David, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxi. 8, 9. <HI>Bles∣sed
is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord,</HI> John
xii. 13. The Acclamations, and the ceremonies they
used, suffciently declare their meaning. When <HI>Jehu</HI>

ix. 7.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Antiq. 1. ix. c. 6. §. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE were their expectations, this the notion they
had of the Messiah; as is evident from the many Im∣postors
<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">See the Bishop of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield</HI>'s Desence of Christ: Chap. i. particularly p. 29. first edit.</NOTE> which arose about this time in <HI>Judea;</HI> all
which, according to <HI>Josephus,</HI> gained many followers.
But as several passages concerning them will appear
in other parts of this work, and one or two by and by
in this chapter, I shall take no farther notice of them
in this place. There are passages of divers ancient
writers, in which these things are expressly asserted.
Most of them have been already offered to the world
<PB N="171" REF="189"/>
in our own language; but neverthelesse they cannot
be omitted here.</P>
<P>ONE is in <HI>Josephus.</HI> “But that which principally
encouraged them to the war, was an ambiguous
oracle, found likewise in the sacred writings, that
about that time, some one from their country,
should obtain the empire of the world. This they
understood to belong to theraselves<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">For this they had received (by tradition) that it was spoke of one of their Nation. Bishop of <HI>Cov.</HI> Defence, P. 26.</NOTE>. And ma∣ny
of the wise men were mistaken in their judgment
of it. For the oracle intended <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s govern∣ment,
who was proclaimed Emperour in <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Jos. de Bell. 1. vi. c. 5. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THERE are two Heathen Historians, who have
mentioned this same thing. <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life of <HI>Ve∣spasian</HI>
says, “There had been for a long time, all o∣ver
the <HI>East.</HI> a notion, firmly believed, that it was
in the Fates [<HI>in the decrees or books of the fates</HI>] that
at that time, some which came out of <HI>Judea,</HI> should
obtain the empire of the world. By the event it ap∣peared
that prediction related to the Roman Em∣perour.
The <HI>Jews</HI> applying it to themselves went
Into a rebellion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Percrebuerat Oriente toto vetus &amp; constans opinio: esse in fatis, ut eo tempore Judaea prosecti rerum potiren∣tur. Id de Imperatore R. quantum eventu postea praedictum pasuit. Judaei ad se trahentes, rebellarunt, Cap. iv.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Tacitus</HI> says is much to the same purpose.
Having related many calamities of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and di∣vers
Prodigies that preceded the destruction of <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
he goes on: “The generality had a strong per∣swasion,
that it was set down in the ancient writings
of the Priests, that at that very time the <HI>East</HI> should
prevail; and that some who came out of <HI>Judea</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="190"/>
should obtain the empire of the world. Which am∣biguities
foretold <HI>Vespasian</HI> and <HI>Titus.</HI> But the com∣mon
people, according to the usual influence of
human passions, having once appropriated to them∣selves
this vast grandeur of the Fates, could not
be brought to understand the true meaning by all
their adversities<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">—Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum litteris conti∣neri, ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judaeâ rerum potirentur.

I. v. c. 13.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THERE is a passage or two more which I would
give here, and which appear to me very material: they
are the words of <HI>Celsus,</HI> who flourished not long after
the middle of the second Century. They are cited by
<HI>Origen,</HI> from <HI>Celsus</HI>'s, books against the Christian Reli∣gion,
in a good part of which he argued in the charac∣ter
of a <HI>Jew.</HI> “How could we, <HI>says he,</HI> who had
told all men, there would come one from God,
who should punish the wicked, despise him if he
came<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Or. con. Celf. lib. i. p. 61. Ed. Cant. 4to.</NOTE>?” And in another place he says: “The
prophets say, that he who is to come is great, and
a prince, and Lord of all the earth, and of all the
nations, and of armies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Id. lib. ii. p. 78.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>BESIDE these, there is another passage in <HI>Josephus</HI>
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 17. cap. 2. sub sin.</NOTE>, which, I think, deservesa particular attention.
It must be produced hereafter, upon<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Josephus</HI> in the Index, His account of a terrible execu∣tion At <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></NOTE> another oc∣casion:
and for that I reserve it.</P>
<P>§. II. THE Evangelists have related many wonder∣ful
works, of various kinds, which were performed
by our Saviour. And in some places they say, he
wrought <HI>signs. And many other</HI> SIGNS <HI>truly did Jesus
<PB N="173" REF="191"/>
in the presence of his disciples,</HI> John xx. 30. And St.
<HI>Peter</HI> tells the <HI>Jews,</HI> that Jesus was a <HI>man approved of
God among them by miracles, and wonders, and</HI> SIGNS,
<HI>which God did by him in the midst of them,</HI> Acts ii. 22.
But yet, they assure us, that notwithstanding this, the
<HI>Jews</HI> would be often asking him for a <HI>Sign. Then cer∣tain
of the Scribes and of the Pharisees answered, say∣ing,
master we would see a</HI> SIGN <HI>from thee,</HI> Matt, xii.
38. The <HI>Sadducees</HI> also had this demand to make.
<HI>The</HI> Pharisees <HI>also with the</HI> Sadducees <HI>came, and tempt∣ing
him, desired him that he would shew them a sign from
haven,</HI> Ch. xvi. I. Again, <HI>they said unto him, what
sign shewest thou then, that we may fee and believe thee?</HI>
John vi. 30. The sign they wanted must needs have
been of a different kind from any of those, which Je∣sus
had given them. The words that follow are some∣what
remarkable: <HI>our fathers did eat manna in the de∣sert,
as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to
eat,</HI> ver. 31. And the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> a good while af∣ter
this, says; <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>require a</HI> SIGN, I <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 22.</P>
<P>A short passage or two from <HI>Josephus</HI> will confirm,
and explain this matter. Representing the state of af∣fairs
in <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Felix,</HI> he says: “And deceivers
and impostors<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. J. lib. ii. c. 13. §. 4.</NOTE>, under a pretense of divine inspi∣ration,
aiming at innovations and changes, per∣swaded
the people into distraction, and drew them
into the wildernesse; where they assured them, God
would shew them SIGNS OF LIBERTY.” This is in
his <HI>jewish war.</HI> In his <HI>Antiquities</HI> he writes thus of the
same affair: “And impostors and deceivers per∣swaded
the multitude to follow them into the wil∣dernesse.
For they said they would there shew
them manifest wonders and signs, which would be
<PB N="174" REF="192"/>
wrought by the power [or providence] of God<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 20. c. 7. §. 6.</NOTE>.”
This shews they wanted some sign of liberty, or of a
temporal deliverance.</P>
<P>§. III. <HI>ACCORDING to St.</HI> John, <HI>the</HI> Samaritans
<HI>also had at this time expectations of the Messiah.</HI> The
woman saith unto him I know that <HI>MESSIAS COMETH,</HI>
which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us
all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee
am he, <HI>John</HI> iv. 25, 26.—The woman went her way
into the City, and saith to the men, come see a man which
told me all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ?
<HI>ver.</HI> 29. New when the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were come unto him—
<HI>and had heard him,</HI> they said unto the woman, now we
believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard
him ourselves, and know that this is the Christ the Saviour
of the world, <HI>v.</HI> 42.</P>
<P>THIS supposition is confirmed by an account,
which <HI>Josephus</HI> has given of an affair, which happen∣ed
in the latter end of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s government, A. D. 35,
or 36. “ Nor were the <HI>Samaritans, says he,</HI> free from
disturbance. For there was among them a man
who made no scruple of a lie, and contrived all he
said so as might best please the people. He publish∣ed
orders that they should meet together, and go
with him up to mount <HI>Garizim,</HI> which is esteemed
by them the most holy of all mountains. He as∣sured
them that when they were got to the top of it
he would shew them the sacred vessels which had
been laid up there under ground by <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. xviii. c. 5. §. I.</NOTE>. They
<PB N="175" REF="193"/>
taking what he said for truth, armed themselves,
and posting themselves in a certain village called
<HI>Tiratbaba,</HI> there received all that flocked to them,
intending to ascend the mountain in a large body.
But a detachment of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Soldiers, horse and
foot, having first intercepted their passage, fell up∣on
them in the village, and at the first attack, slew
some, dispersed others, and took a good number
prisoners, the chief of whom <HI>Pilate</HI> put to death”.</P>
<P>THIS affair is a proof that the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were
now in expectation of some extraordinary events.
This deceiver accommodated his speeches to the hu∣mour
and sentiments of the people, and they credited
readily what he said. But this is not all: The sub∣stance
of his promises is a proof, they were now in ex∣pectation of some discoveries and regulations concern∣ing
matters of <HI>religion.</HI> For, certainly, if they found
these sacred vessels, they supposed they should have
some instructions also what to do with them. Nor
could they think him an ordinary prophet, that should
be honoured with such a commission<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">See Bishop <HI>Chandler</HI>'s Defence of Christianity, chap. I. Sect. 3. at the end.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I must inform the reader, that in all our present
copies of <HI>Josepbus</HI> the hiding these sacred vessels is
ascribed to <HI>Moses.</HI> And his name was read in this
place by <HI>Epiphanius</HI> and <HI>Zonaras</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hudson. Notas in Joseph. Ioc.</NOTE> But <HI>Reland</HI>
suspected, that for <HI>Moses</HI> we ought to read <HI>Ozes.</HI> One
of his reasons is, that in an ancient <HI>Samaritan Chroni∣de,</HI>
the Manuscript of which he had in his possession,
there is an account of the laying up of sacred vessels
by the divine appointment in a cave on Mount <HI>Gari∣zim,</HI>
during the High Priesthood of <HI>Ozes,</HI> or <HI>Ozi.</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="194"/>
But that, when afterwards he came to look for them
he could not find them. <HI>Reland</HI> is inclined to think,
that the High Priest here intended is <HI>Uzzi,</HI> mention∣ed
i <HI>Chron</HI> vi. 6. who was the fifth from <HI>Aaron.</HI> The
story related in his <HI>Chronicle</HI> is almost the very same
which is told in the second Book of <HI>Maccabees, ch.</HI> ii.
with scarce any other difference, but that of <HI>Jeremie</HI>
for <HI>Ozi,</HI> and <HI>Nebo</HI> for <HI>Garizim</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Substitue pro Jeremia Ozin, pro monte Nebo Garizim cu tera conveniunt. Reland Dissert. de Monte Garizim. §. 14.</NOTE> I shall therefore
set down here the account in the <HI>Maccabees.</HI> It is, I
think, an argument that according to traditions, which
they then had among them, the discovery of the <HI>sa∣cred
vessels</HI> would be immediately followed by very
glorious times; and consequently, that this passage
from <HI>Josephus</HI> is to the purpose for which I have al∣leged
it. <HI>It was also contained in the same writing, that
the prophet being warned of God, commanded the taber∣nacle
and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the
mountain, where</HI> Moses <HI>climbed up, and saw the heri∣tage
of God. And when</HI> Jeremie <HI>came thither, he found
an hollow cave wherein he laid the tabernacle and the art,
and the altar of incense, and stopped the door. And some
of those that followed him, came to mark the way, but
they could not find it. Which when</HI> Jeremie <HI>perceived,
he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be un∣known
until the time that God gather his people again to∣gether,
and receive them unto mercy. Then shall the Lord
shew them these things, and the glory of the Lord shall ap∣pear,
and the cloud also as it was shewed under</HI> Moses,
<HI>and as when</HI> Solomon <HI>desired that the place might be ho∣nourably
sanctified,</HI> 2 Mace. ii. 4—8.</P>
<P>§. IV. IT has been shewn that the <HI>Jews</HI> had now
expectations of the coming of the Messiah, and that
they hoped for a temporal salvation from him. But it
is not to be thought, they looked for nothing else.
After the miracle of the five loaves, St. <HI>John</HI> says;
<HI>Then these men when they had seen the miracle which
<PB N="177" REF="195"/>
Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that
should come into the world. When Jesus therefore per∣ceived
that they would come and take him by force, to
make him a king, be departed again into a mountain him∣self
alone,</HI> John vi. 14, 15. These two characters
therefore of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and a <HI>King,</HI> were joined toge∣ther
in the thoughts of <HI>these men.</HI></P>
<P>THE woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> likewise plainly supposes
the Messiah was to be a great <HI>Prophet.</HI> She <HI>knew</HI> that
when he who is called Christ was come, he would <HI>tell
them all things.</HI> Upon Jesus <HI>telling her all things that
ever she did,</HI> she concluded he was <HI>the Christ.</HI> And
she supposed, this would be an argument with the
men whom she went to, to believe the same thing:
And we find it had great weight with them, though
they were farther confirmed by what they afterwards
heard from Jesus themselves. The expectation of
great discoveries in matters of religion appears also in
the passage just transcribed from <HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>§. V. I choose to conclude this chapter with some
reflexions.</P>
<P>1. WE may now perceive one reason, why our
Blessed Lord often forbade men to publish the cures
he had wrought upon them; why he so often moved
from one place to another; why he so rarely affirmed
in express terms, in the hearing of the people, that he
was the Christ Whilst they had so strong a perswa∣sion,
that the Messiah would be a temporal deliverer,
there was a necessity for this conduct. It was impo∣sible,
otherwise, to avoid giving umbrage to the Ro∣man
government, and to hinder the people from ac∣tually
making attempts that would have exposed them
to justice. He therefore contented himself with de∣claring
that the kingdome of heaven was at hand, that
the Father had sent him, that he was he of whom <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>
and the Prophets had written, that he was blessed
who should not be offended in him (all which they
knew to be characters of the Messiah) wrought mi∣racles,
preached righteousnesse, and endeavoured to
<PB N="178" REF="196"/>
correct their false sentiments and corrupt affections.
In a word, it was necessary he should do, just as he
did, according to the divine character he sustains
throughout the Gospels.</P>
<P>2. WE see here the ground of the different respect
which seems to have been shewn to <HI>John the Baptist</HI>
and <HI>Jesus, Many of the</HI> Pharisees <HI>and</HI> Sadducces <HI>came
to his Baptism,</HI> Matth. iii. 7. And of others there
seems to have been a general resort. And for some
time afterwards it was dangerous to deny the validity
or authority of his baptism: <HI>for all held</HI> John <HI>to be a
prophet,</HI> Matth. xxi, 26. Their general expectation of
the Messiah raised their attention to <HI>John.</HI> But their
particular Idea of the <HI>Messah</HI> disgusted them against <HI>Je∣sus.</HI>
He (says our Lord to them) <HI>was a burning and
shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoyce in
his light,</HI> John v. 35. They had, no doubt, but that a
very great person was coming among them; and they
were pleased to hear <HI>John</HI> say, that he was his fore∣runner:
but when Jesus came, he was not such a per∣son
as they wished for.</P>
<P>3. WE see here the reason of the different reception
given to <HI>Jesus</HI> by the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and the <HI>people.</HI> The
same notions seem to have been common to all, and
the passion of the people for <HI>liberty</HI> was as warm, as
that of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> for power and grandeur. But the
people could not see very far; and they hoped, even
contrary to present appearances, that Jesus might
some time undertake the deliverance they wanted. But
the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who had more penetration, saw from
the beginning, that he was a man void of all worldly
ambition, and that no such principle would be grati∣fied
under him. His peculiar blessings were all be∣stowed
on the <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> the <HI>meek, and those that
were persecuted for righteousnesse sake;</HI> he exhorted <HI>men
to pray, fast, give alms in secret,</HI> to entertain <HI>the poor,
the maimed, the holt, the blind,</HI> in hopes of being <HI>re∣compensed
at the resurrection of the just;</HI> and he openly
neglected <HI>the traditions of the elders.</HI> They could be
<PB N="179" REF="197"/>
sure from hence, that Jesus did not intend to enrich
his followers by worldly conquests; that this doctrine
was no prelude to an universal temporal empire; and
that according to these measures, their darling princi∣ples,
instead of prevailing, would be for ever dis∣graced.
Therefore these men pursued him, almost
universally, from first to last, with an uninterrupted
course of secret, or open malice.</P>
<P>4. THIS notion of theirs gives us the reason, why
many owned Jesus <HI>for a time,</HI> and then for sook him.
They came in to him upon the supposition of his be∣ing
a temporal deliverer of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation. But by
his conduct, or some things they heard from him,
they were convinced they had gone upon a wrong
foundation.</P>
<P>5. IT does also account for that sudden change in
the people at the conclnsion of our Saviour's ministry.
They attend him with great state into <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and
a few daies after, they cry out, not this man but <HI>Bar∣rabbas.</HI>
The reason seems to be this: His not as∣suming
then the character of a temporal prince, or at
lest, not giving them some sign of liberty, had been
a vast disappointment, and left a deep resenment;
which rendered them susceptible afterward of the
worst impressions from the chief priests and Pha∣risees.</P>
<P>6. THE particulars abovementioned may help us
to conceive the truth of what is related, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 26.
<HI>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
without violence; for they feared the people, lest they
should have been stoned.</HI> Strange! That they should
now have such a zeal and affection for the disciples
of Jesus, whom they had so lately desired with loud
voices to be crucified, as to be ready to do violence
to the officers of the council for their security. But
however strange this may seem, there is no manner
of reason to doubt the truth of it. What has been al∣leged
from <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> assures us, that tho'
often disappointed, they were not disheartned. Tho'
<PB N="180" REF="198"/>
Jesus had been crucisied, a surprising power appeared
in his disciples, and wonderful works were wrought by
them in the name of Jesus; which were infallible
proofs of his resurrection and ascension. Hereupon,
undoubtedly, the hopes of the salvation they wished
for, revived in these men.</P>
<P>7. THE <HI>Jews</HI> expectation of a temporal deliverance
for their nation, nourished and strengthened by sen∣sual
passions, together with their prodigious wicked∣nesse,
which they, in their fond imaginations, had re∣conciled
with the peculiar friendship and favour of
God, does fully account for this peoples so generally
rejecting and despising Jesus, though there was the
fullest proof given, that he was he who was to come.
<HI>I am come,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>in my father's name, and
ye receive me not. If another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive,</HI> John v. 43. They were ready to
joyn any one, who made them promises of a temporal
salvation, but they would not receive, or at lest, not
hold to any one that did not. If they would have re∣ceived
any one without this condition, they would
have received Jesus.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the great Corruption of the Jewish
People.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Evangelists have represented the <HI>jewish</HI>
nation as very corrupt and wicked about
the time our Saviour conversed and taught
in this world. When <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapitist
saw many of the</HI> Pharisees <HI>aad</HI> Sadducees
<HI>come to his Baptism, he said unto them, O generation of
Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
Come?</HI> Matth. iii. 7. Our Lord himself calls them
<HI>an evil and adulterous generation,</HI> Ch. xii. 39. When
they boasted of their relation to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and yet
sought <HI>to kill him who had told them the truth,</HI> our Sa∣viour
tells them: <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and
the works of your father ye will do,</HI> John viii. 40—44.
Our Lord often intimates, that the true reason why
his Doctrine was so little regarded by them, was this;
that their affections were entirely engaged by worldly
advantages, and they had no sincere love of truth or
virtue. <HI>This is the condemnation, that light is come into
the world; and men loved darkness rather than light be∣cause
their deeds were evil,</HI> John iii. 19. <HI>How can ye
believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not
that honour which cometh from God only?</HI> Ch. v. 44,
And from many other parts of the Gospels it is evi∣dent,
their righteousnesse consisted in a regard to some
ritual parts of <HI>Moses</HI>'s Law, and in observing the tra∣ditional
rules of the elders; <HI>making broad their phylac∣teries,
and enlarging the border of their garments; in pay∣ing
tithes of mint and anise and cummin; while they o∣mitted
<PB N="182" REF="200"/>
the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy
and faith,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 5—23.</P>
<P>THAT the corruption of the <HI>Jews</HI> is not at all ag∣gravated
here, is evident from the character given of
tnese times, or of those very near them, by <HI>Josephus</HI>
himself, who was zealous for the honour of his country.
“<HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ozar, says he,</HI> the chief man among the <HI>Sica∣mi</HI>
<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Villains that went with short swords concealed under their clothes.</NOTE> was a desendant <HI>Judas</HI> who had per∣swaded
not a few of the <HI>Jews</HI> not to enrolle them∣selves,
when <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renius</HI> the <HI>Censor</HI> was sent into <HI>Judea.</HI>
For then the <HI>Siearii</HI> conspired against all that were
willing to submit to the <HI>Romans.</HI> They treated all
such as public enemies:—Affirming they were
no better than strangers, since they surrendered to
the <HI>Romans</HI> those privileges of their nation, which
ought to be precious to all <HI>Jews.</HI>—But all this was
mere pretense, an I given out with no other view
than to cover their cruelty and avarice.—That
was indeed a time fruitful of all sorts of wickednesse
among the <HI>Jews;</HI> so that no evil whatever was left
unpractised. It is impossilble for man to contrive
any new wickendnesse, which was not then commit∣ted.
All were corrupt in their private and pub∣lic
character. They strove to exceed each other in
impiety toward God, and injustice toward their
neighbour. The great men oppressed the people,
and the people strove to ruin them. The former
were ambitious of dominion and power, the latter
had an insatiable thirst of violence and plunder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. lib. vii. c. 8. 6. I.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="201"/>
IT appears from hence, that the corruption of this
people was general. If <HI>Josephus</HI> had not made this
acknowledgement, it might have been proved by an
enumeration of the many acts of injustice and vilany
he has related, that all sorts of people were abandoned
to wickednesse, I think this is not needful: I shall
however add two or three more passages.</P>
<P>IN his account of their affairs, whilst <HI>Felix</HI> was
Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> he has these words: “Such was
the impudence of the High Priests, that they would
send their servants to the store-houses to seise and
bring away the tithes that belonged to the Priests;
by which means some of the Priests, whose circum∣stances
were but strait, perished for want: so far
did the violence of factious men prevail over justice
and equity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7. §. 8.</NOTE>.” Did not our Saviour say very
truly; <HI>It is written, My house shall be called the house
of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves?</HI> Matth.
xxi. 13.</P>
<P>NOT far off from this passage there is another,
which may give us an idea of their hypocrisie (a crime
they are often charged with in the <HI>Gospels</HI>) and of
their artful and impudent pretensions to religion, when
they intended the greatest vilanies. <HI>Felix</HI> by a large
sum of money perswaded <HI>Dora,</HI> a native of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
and an intimate friend of the High Priest <HI>Jonathan</HI> to
undertake, that the said High Priest should be mur∣dered.
<HI>Dora</HI> accordingly hired some of the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ibid. §. 5.</NOTE> rob∣bers
(so <HI>Josephus</HI> calls a set of men the country was
then filled with) for this purpose. “some of these
men coming up into the City, as if with a design
to worship God, and having short swords under
their coats, mixing themselves with the multitude,
kill <HI>Jonathan.</HI> This murder passing unpunished,
after this the robbers came in at the Feasts without
any manner of concern; and carrying, as before,
<PB N="184" REF="202"/>
swords under their clothes, and mixing with the
multitudes, they killed divers people; some whom
they reckoned their enemies, some whom they were
hired by others to destroy. This they did, not
only in other parts of city, but within the bounds
of the temple itself<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ibid.</NOTE>. For even there would
they kill men, and yet not seem to commit any
crime. For this reason, it seems to me, that God,
detesting their impiety, forsook our city; and not
esteeming the temple any longer a pure habitation
for him, brought the <HI>Romans</HI> against us, threw on
the city a fire to purisy it, and delivered up us with
our wives and children to servitude, that by these
calamities we might learn wisdome.”</P>
<P>THEPE is another noted passage of the same histo∣rian,
which may not be omitted. “I cannot say it
without regret, yet I must declare, it is my opi∣nion,
that if the <HI>Romans</HI> had delayed to come a∣gainst
these wretches, the City [<HI>viz. Jerusalem</HI>]
would have been swallowed up by an earthquake,
or overwhelmed by a deluge, or else been consumed
by fire from heaven, as <HI>Sodom</HI> was: For it bore
a generation of men more wicked than those which
had suffered such calamities<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. lib. v. c. 13 §. 6.</NOTE>.” I conclude with
the following short passage. “To reckon up all
their vilanies, <HI>says he,</HI> is impossible: but in a word,
never did any city suffer so great calamities; nor
was there ever from the beginning of the world
a time more fruitful of wickednesse than that
was<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. cap. 10. §. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the history of our Saviour's last Suf∣ferings
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there is mention
made of four persons of distinction;
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> the High Priest, <HI>Pontius Pi∣late</HI>
the Governour, his wife, and <HI>Herod</HI>
the Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee.</HI></P>
<P>§. I. ST. <HI>Matthew says; Then assemhled together the
chief priests and the Scribes, and the elders of the people,
unto the palace of the</HI> HIGH PRIEST, <HI>who was called</HI>
CAIAPHAS, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 3. And afterwards; <HI>Then
they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to</HI> CAIA∣PHAS
<HI>the high priest,</HI> ver. 57. St. <HI>John</HI> likewise assures
us, that at this time, <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was the High Priest,
and has informed us of a particular omitted by St.
<PB N="186" REF="204"/>
<HI>Matthew,</HI> namely, that our Saviour was first carried
to <HI>Annas. And led him away to</HI> Annas <HI>first, (for he
was father in law to</HI> CAIAPHAS <HI>which was the high priest
that same year,)</HI> John xviii. 13. And again, <HI>Now</HI> An∣nas
<HI>had sent him bound unto</HI> CAIAPHAS THE HIGH
PRIEST, ver. 24—28.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Caiphas</HI> was now High Priest, appears
hence: He was made High Priest by <HI>Valerius Gratus,</HI>
predecessor of <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> and was put out of that
office by <HI>Vitellius</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> after <HI>Pilate</HI> was
sent away out of the province of <HI>Judea. Josephus</HI> in∣forms
us of <HI>Caiaphas</HI>'s advancement to the Priesthood
in these words: “And a year after, he [<HI>Gratus</HI>] re∣moved
him [<HI>Eleazar the Son of</HI> Ananus] and gave
the High Priefthood to <HI>Simon</HI> the Son of <HI>Camithus.</HI>
He, having enjoyed this honour not above a year,
was succeeded by <HI>Joseph,</HI> who is also called CAIA∣PHAS.
After this, <HI>Gratus</HI> went away for <HI>Rome,</HI>
having been eleven years in <HI>Judea.</HI> And <HI>Pontius
Pilate</HI> came thither as his Successor<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 18. c. 2. §. 2.</NOTE>.” The
same historian gives us the account of <HI>Caiaphas</HI>'s re∣moval
in this manner. <HI>Vitellius,</HI> whilst in <HI>Syria,</HI> sent
orders to <HI>Pilate</HI> to repair to <HI>Rome;</HI> after which, <HI>Vitel∣lias</HI>
went up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and there gave directions
concerning several matters. “Having done these
things, <HI>says Josephus,</HI> he took away the priesthood
from the high priest <HI>Joseph,</HI> who is also called
CAIAPHAS, and appointed <HI>Jonathan</HI> the Son of
<HI>Ananus</HI> high priest: And then returned to <HI>An∣tioch</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ibid. c. 5. § 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="205"/>
IT is evident therefore, that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was High
Priest, all the time that <HI>Pilate</HI> was in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>§. II. WE shall presently have occasion to take
notice of several things concerning <HI>Pilate;</HI> I shall
here only shew that PILATE was at this time Gover∣nour
of <HI>Judea.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>Now in the</HI> FIFTEENTH
YEAR <HI>of the reign of</HI> Tiberius Cesar, PONTIUS PILATE
BEING GOVERNOUR OF JUDEA, <HI>the word of God came
unto</HI> John <HI>the Son of</HI> Zacharias <HI>in the wildernesse,</HI> Luke
iii, 1, 2. If St. <HI>Luke</HI> in this text intends, not the fif∣teenth
year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign from the death of <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
but the fifteenth year of his Proconsular power,
when he was made Collegue of <HI>Augustus;</HI> it may pos∣sibly
admit a debate, whether <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was go∣vernour
of <HI>Judea,</HI> when <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> began to
preach: therefore I have reserved the consideration of
that particular for the next book. But there can be
no question made, but that <HI>Pilate</HI> was governour of
<HI>Judea,</HI> at the time of our Saviour's crucifixion;
whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> be understood in that place, to speak
of the <HI>Proconsular</HI> Power of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> or of his <HI>sole
empire</HI> after the death of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>THE fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular Em∣pire,
and the twelfth of his sole Empire are pretty
near coincident. For the 15th of his Proconsular
Empire is supposed to begin<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Crit, in Baron. A. D. 25.</NOTE> about the 27th of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
A. D. 25. And the 12th of his sole empire be∣gan
the 19th of <HI>August</HI> in the same year.</P>
<P>THERE is undoubtedly some difficulty in comput∣ing
exactly the time, which the Evangelists have al∣lotted
to <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s and our Saviour's ministry.
But whether we understand St. <HI>Luke</HI> to speak of the
<HI>fifteenth</HI> of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s proconsular power, or of his
sole empire; I think, that the earliest date of our Sa∣viour's
<HI>crucifixion</HI> must be that of the <HI>jewish</HI> Passover,
which happened in the 15th year <HI>of Tiberius</HI>'s sole Em∣pire,
A. D. 29, and the latest date the <HI>jewish</HI> Passover,
<PB N="188" REF="206"/>
which happened in the 19th year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s sole
empire, A. D. 33.</P>
<P>TAKE any year from 29 to 33 inclusively; and
<HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was governour of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be made appear in this manner. <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>
died the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. 37. n. ii.</NOTE>. <HI>Vitellius</HI>
received the tidings of it at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant, lib. xviii. cap. vi. p. 806. in.</NOTE> But <HI>Pilate</HI>
had been removed sometime before this<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. v. §. 2.</NOTE>, as is al∣lowed
by all: how long before, we will nor now en∣quire.
<HI>Pilate</HI> therefore was removed from his govern∣ment
before the passover A. D. 37. when he had been
there <HI>ten years.</HI> So <HI>Josephus</HI> says expresly: “And
<HI>Pilate</HI> having been ten years in <HI>Judea,</HI> hastened a∣way
to <HI>Rome,</HI> in obedience to the orders he had
received from <HI>Vitellius,</HI> not daring to refuse<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. ibid.</NOTE>.”
Substract ten from 37, and it appears that <HI>Pilate</HI> was
governour of <HI>Judea,</HI> before the Passover in A. D. 27,
and consequently before our Saviour's last sufferings.</P>
<P>THAT our Saviour was crucified in <HI>Judea,</HI> in the
reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> under <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> is the unani∣mous
testimony of Christian writers; is particularly
mentioned<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Auctor nominis ejus Christus, qui Tiberio imperitante, per PROCURATOREM POSTIUM PILATUM supplicio affectus erat. Ann. lib. xv. cap. 44.</NOTE> by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> an Heathen author; and is
not denied by any. But this being a principal Fact,
I am not obliged to produce any passages relating to it
now. All I am concerned to do at present is, to shew,
that according to the notes of time, mentioned by
the Evangelists, <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> must have been gover∣nour
of <HI>Judea,</HI> when our Saviour was crucified.
This I presume I have made appear from <HI>Josephus,</HI>
who must be allowed to have known, what govern∣ment
his own country was under at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="207"/>
§ III. <HI>ST.</HI> Matthew <HI>says, that</HI> when he [<HI>Pilate</HI>] was
set down on the judgment Seat, his <HI>WIFE</HI> sent unto him,
saying; Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for
I have suffered many things this day in a dream, because
of him, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvii. 19.</P>
<P>So long as the Commonwealth subsisted, it was ve∣ry unusual for the governours of the provinces to take
their wíves with them: and afterward, <HI>Augustus</HI> seems
not much to have approved of it<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Disciplinam severissime rexit, ne legatorum quidem cuiquam nisi gravate, hibernisque demum mensibus, permisit uxorem inter∣visere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sueton. in A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g. cap. 24.</NOTE>. But however,
the contrary custom prevailed. It is evident from
<HI>Tacitus,</HI> that at the time of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s death, <HI>Germa∣nicus</HI>
had his wife <HI>Agrippina</HI> with him in <HI>Germany</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tacit. ann. lib. i. cap. 40, 41.</NOTE>.
And in the beginning of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> reign, he carried
her with him into the <HI>East</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. ii. cap. 54.</NOTE>. And <HI>Piso,</HI> the prefect
of <HI>Syria</HI> took his wife also along with him, at the
same time<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 55.</NOTE>. But there is nothing can render this
more apparent than a motion, made in the Roman
Senate by <HI>Severus Caecina,</HI> in the 4th Consulship of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> and 2d of <HI>Drusus Caesar,</HI> A. D. 21. “That
no Magistrate, to whom any province was assign∣ed,
should be accompanied by his wife<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Infer quae se∣vera Ceecina censuit, <HI>ne quem magistratum,</HI> cui rovincia obvenisset, uxor comitare ur Id. An. lib. iii. c. 33.</NOTE>.”; ex∣cept
the Senates rejecting it, and that with some in∣dignation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Paucorum haec adsensa audits, plures obturbabant <HI>neque relatum de negotio, neque Caecinam dignum tantae rei censorem,</HI> ibid. cap. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§. IV. St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, that <HI>when</HI> Pilate <HI>heard of</HI> Ga∣lilee,
<HI>he asked whether the man were a</HI> Galilean. <HI>And
as soon</HI> as he knew, that he belonged to <HI>Herod</HI>'s ju∣ridiction,
he sent him to HEROD, WHO HIMSELF
WAS ALSO AT JERUSALEM AT THAT TIME, <HI>Luke</HI>
xxiii. 7. As this <HI>Herod</HI> was the Son of <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great, and a <HI>Jew,</HI> there is all the reason in the world
to suppose, that he often went to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the
<HI>jewish</HI> Feasts. <HI>Josephus</HI> has particularly mentioned his
<PB N="190" REF="208"/>
being there at one of their Feasts, A. D. 37. which I
believe none will deny to be the Feast of the <HI>Passover,</HI>
He is speaking of <HI>Vitellius</HI> president of <HI>Syria.</HI> “Ha∣ving
given directions about these matters, he [<HI>Vi∣tellius</HI>]
went up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with <HI>Herod</HI> the Te∣trarch
and his friends to worship God, a Feast of
the <HI>Jews</HI> being nigh at hand<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. Antiq. lib. 18. c. 6. §. 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>HAVING dispatched these general things, we may
now take the remaining particulars in the order, in
which they lie.</P>
<P><HI>§. V. WHILST our Saviour was under examina∣tion
before the High Priest and rulers of the</HI> Jews,
<HI>after they had in vain attempted to get evidence against
him from witnesses, 'tis related, that the High Priest</HI>
said unto him; I adjure thee by the living God, that thou
tell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus
saith unto him, thou hast said: nevertheless, I say unto
you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest <HI>RENT HIS CLOTHES,</HI> saying, He
hath spoken blasphemy, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 63—65.</P>
<P>IT has been thought by some, that the high priest
might not rend his clothes: But, that he might, and
did do so, upon extraordinary occasions, will appear
from the following particulars. The Author of the
first book of <HI>Maccabees</HI> says; <HI>Then</HI> Jonathan <HI>rent his
clothes, and cast earth upon his head,</HI> I Macc. xi. 71.
<HI>Jonathan</HI> was then High Priest: the occasion of this
action was his mens running away from their enemies.
Doftor <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> in his <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Talmudical Exer∣citations</HI>
upon this text of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> quotes these
words from <HI>Maimonides: When witnesses speak out the
blasphemy which they heard, then all hearing the blasphe∣my
are bound to rend their clothes.</HI> As the High Priest
among the <HI>Jews</HI> was one of their judges, and was pre∣sent
at their trials, he must be comprehended in this
<PB N="191" REF="209"/>
rule. I subjoin to these a passage of <HI>Josephus.</HI> Perhaps
it will not be thought to come up to our point, be∣cause
he does not speak of the <HI>High Priest</HI> in the sin∣gular
number. But I do not see, why the person, who
was actually in the High Priesthood, must be exclud∣ed;
and in one respect it exceeds the fact, now before
us For <HI>Caiaphas</HI> undoubtedly had on, at this time,
his ordinary clothes; whereas, <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of the
priests rending the garments which they wore in their
ministrations at the temple.</P>
<P>THE case was this: <HI>Florus,</HI> governour of <HI>Judea,</HI>
had plundered the sacred treasury at <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Bell. J. lib. ii. cap. 14. §. 6.</NOTE>,
and committed many other abuses. Hereupon the
<HI>Jews,</HI> being highly provoked, were ready to break
out into war with the <HI>Romans.</HI> And a great number
of them, being got together into an open place in the
City, gave out many reflexions upon <HI>Floras. Josephus</HI>
says, that upon this, “The chief men and the High
Priests, being filled with concern, RENT THEIR
GARMENTS and falling down upon their knees<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. cap. 15. §. 2.</NOTE>
beseeched the people to be peaceable, and to bear
patiently what had past already, rather than pro∣voke
<HI>Florus</HI> to do still worse.”</P>
<P>WHEN this tumult was appeased, <HI>Florus</HI> intending
(as <HI>Josephus</HI> supposes) to exact conditions the people
would not comply with, and thereby to bring on an
open war, “called the chief men to him, and told
them, that he would esteem this a testimony of their
fidelity, and of their intention to be quiet for the
future, if the people would go out of the City, and
salute his soldiers, which were then coming from
<HI>Cesarea.</HI> ” The chief men of the <HI>Jews</HI> then called
the people to the temple, and desired them to sub∣mit
to these demands; but were not able to pre∣vail
upon them. “Then every Priest and Mini∣ster
of God, when they had brought forth the holy
<PB N="192" REF="210"/>
Vessels, being clothed in the vestments which they
wear in their sacred functions, entreated them not
to exasperate the <HI>Romans</HI> to come and take away
from them those things which were consecrated to
God. Then might be seen the High Priests them∣selves
with ashes on their heads, and their breasts
naked, THEIR GARMENTS BEING RENT<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. § 3, 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. VI. IN this History we have frequent mention
of <HI>chief priests,</HI> in the plural number. <HI>Now the chief
priests and elders and all the Council sought false witnesse
against him,</HI> Matth. xxiv. 59. <HI>And they led Jesus away
to the High Priest: and with him were assembled the chief
priests and the elders and the scribes,</HI> Mark xiv. 53. I
know not, but this may be thought by some an im∣propriety,
in the Evangelists expression; because
strictly there was but one High Priest among the <HI>Jews</HI>
at a time. This is certainly very true, and the Evan∣gelists
appear to have known it very well. But then,
all those who had ever bore the office of High Priest
were called so likewise, and I believe some others be∣sides:
I need not now enquire who. But so far is this
stile from affording any just objection against the sa∣cred
Historians, that it may very well be reckoned
one proof of their being well acquainted with the
things, of which they have written; since it is the
usual stile of <HI>Josephus.</HI> I need not produce any parti∣cular
passages for the proof of it. The expression oc∣curs
more than once in those I have just now tran∣scribed.</P>
<P>§. VII. WE are informed, that from the High
Priest's our Saviour <HI>was led away, and delivered to
Pontius Pilate,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 2. All the Evangelists
assure us of this, <HI>Mark</HI> xv. 1. <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 1. <HI>John</HI> xviii.
<PB N="193" REF="211"/>
28, 29. It is plain from the <HI>New Testament</HI> and other
ancient writings, that the Roman Governour of <HI>Jadea</HI>
usually resided at <HI>Cesarea</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Haud dubia destinatione discessere, Muvcianus Antiochiam, Vespasianus Caesaream: illa Syriae; haec Judaeae caput est. Tacit.

up himself to <HI>Jerusalem. Josephus's,</HI> words are these:

<P><PB N="194" REF="212"/>
MOREOVER, very probably <HI>Pilate</HI> was often at
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> at the Feasts, for the <HI>administration
of ju∣stice. Jerusalem</HI> was the chief city of <HI>Judea,</HI> and had
a Council in it. And it was very usual for the Roman

Ver.</HI> lib. v. cap. 11.</NOTE>. And it may be
fairly concluded from the Evangelists, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was
at <HI>jerusalem</HI> now for this very end: As it is also very
plain, that he had used to keep court there, at this
Feast. <HI>Ye have a custom,</HI> says he, <HI>that I should release
unto you one at the Passover,</HI> John xviii. 39.</P>
<P>§. VIII. IN the account, the Evangelists have given
us of <HI>Pilate's</HI> conduct, there are several things very
remarkable; which ought therefore to be considered,
and accounted for. The high priests, and elders of
the <HI>Jews</HI> were very earnest for our Saviour's condem∣nation:
but <HI>Pilate</HI> appears very backward to pro∣nounce any
sentence upon him. <HI>He knew that for envy
they had delivered him,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 18. When they
charged him with stirring up the people, and saying
that he was a King, <HI>Pilate said unto him; art thou the
King of the</HI> Jews? <HI>Luke xxiii. 2. John</HI> xviii. 33. <HI>Jesus
answered, my kingdom is not of this world,</HI> ver. 36. Pi∣late
<HI>therefore said unto him, Art thou a King then? Je∣sus answered, thou sayest that I am a King. To this end
was I born, and for this cause came I into the world,
that I should bear witness to the truth,</HI>—Pilate <HI>saith un∣to
<PB N="195" REF="213"/>
him, what is truth? And when he had said this, he
went out again unto the</HI> Jews, <HI>and saith unto them, I find
in him no fault at all,</HI> ver. 37, 38.</P>
<P>THERE being no proof of any disturbances caused
by our Saviour among the people, <HI>Pilate</HI> enquires in∣to
this charge, of his <HI>taking upon him</HI> the title of a
King: and perceiving, that he intended not by it any
worldly government, but only that his design had
been to teach men some certain principles, he asks
him, <HI>What is truth?</HI> or what was that truth which
he professed to teach? But not being sollicitous to
know particularly what these principles were, and be∣ing
satisfied from what he had already heard from our
Saviour, that there was nothing seditious in them, he
did not stay for an answer to this question; but im∣mediately
goes out to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and tells them: <HI>I
find in him no fault at all</HI></P>
<P>GROTIUS supposes that <HI>Pilate,</HI> by the King∣dome
our Saviour spoke of, understood such a King∣dome
as the <HI>Stoicks</HI> ascribed to their wise men, a King∣dome
no more prejudicial to the Roman Government
than theirs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Grot. in Joh. xviii. 38.</NOTE>. He certainly conceived of our Saviour
as a Leader only of some innocent sect, and appre∣hended,
that it was nothing but envy and secret ma∣lice,
that moved the <HI>Phansees</HI> to demand judgement
against him.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding what <HI>Pilate</HI> said of the inno∣cence
of jesus, the <HI>Jews</HI> were still pressing for a sen∣tence
against him. However <HI>Pilate</HI> could not yet be
prevailed on to answer their demands, but ordered him
to be scourged; and the soldiers platted <HI>a crown of
thorns, and put it upon his head, and they put on him a
purple robe,</HI> John xix. 1, 2. abused and mocked him.
<HI>Pilate,</HI> hoping they might be satisfied with this, <HI>went
forth again; and saith unto them, behold 1 bring him
forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him,</HI>
ver. 4. <HI>When the chief priests therefore and the officers
saw him, they cried out, saying, crucifie him, crucifie him.</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="214"/>
Pilare <HI>saith unto tham: Take ye him and crucifie him: for
I find, no sault in him. The</HI> Jews <HI>answered him, we have
a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself the son of God.</HI> WHEN PILATE THEREFORE
HEARD THAT SAVING HE WAS THE MORE AFRAID,
<HI>ver.</HI> 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>MANY learned and judicious expositors understand
by these last words, that <HI>Pilate</HI> became yet more a∣fraid
than before to pass sentence of condemnation up∣on
Jesus; lest after all, he should prove to be some
extraordinary Person. They think, that having, pro∣bably,
received some accounts of our Saviour's mira∣cles,
and hearing this charge, that he <HI>had made himself
the son of God,</HI> he was brought into some doubts whe∣ther
he might not be some uncommon person, like
those Heroes or Demi-Gods, which were so much
spoken of among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> and there∣fore
he was seised with a fresh fear of being con∣cerned
in his death<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Metuens ob res miras de eo auditas ne forte verum esset or∣tam eum divino satu, sicut Romani &amp; Graeci de Heroibus suis cre∣debant. Grot, in loc. vid. &amp; Hammond, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE words will bear another sense, and ever since
I have read <HI>Josephus,</HI> in whom there are divers instances
of the <HI>jewish</HI> zeal about this time, and of tumults and
seditions which they run into, upon the lest affront of∣fered
to their religious institutions, some of which tu∣mults
<HI>Pilate</HI> had been witnesse to, I have understood
these words in a different sense; and have thought that
<HI>Pilate</HI> finding they interested their religion in this
cause, and that they were resolute in it, became afraid,
he must at last submit to them. And I am glad to find,
that I am not singular in this interpretation. <HI>Beza</HI> says
upon this place: “He was not without reason afraid,
that an open sedition might happen, if he did not
comply with the multitude<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Magis metuit]</HI> Ergo jam antea perculsus erat, alternante ni∣mirum conscientiâ, &amp; clamoribus Judaeorum, nunc etiam legem praetexentium: non temerè veritus, ne tandem seditio aperta erum∣peret, nisi multitudinis voluntati obtemperaret. Bez. Nov. Test in loc. <HI>Calvin</HI> also allowes, that the words are capable of this Sense. Duplex potest elici sensus; prior est quod veritus fuerit <HI>Pilatus</HI> ne sustineret aliquam culpam si exortus esset tumultus, quia Christum non damnasset; alter, quod audito Filii Dei nomine, mens ejus re∣ligione tacta suerit. Which last <HI>Calvin</HI> approves; in loc.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="215"/>
<HI>BUT this sense being liable ro an objection from an
expression St.</HI> John <HI>uses after this, it will be needful
to consider what follows.</HI> Pilate <HI>having heard this,</HI>
went again into the Judgment Hall, and saith unto Jesus,
Whence art thou? but Jesus gave him no answer. Then
saith <HI>Pilate</HI> unto him, speakest thou not unto me? Know∣est
thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and have
power to release thee? Jesus answered, thou couldest
have no power at all against me, except it were given
thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee,
hath the greater sin. And from thenceforth <HI>Pilate</HI> sought
to release him, <HI>John</HI> xix. 9—12.</P>
<P>THESE last words may be reckoned an objection
against the sense, in which I understand the words
above-mentioned. But certainly St. <HI>John</HI> does not
hereby intend, that <HI>Pilate</HI> then <HI>began</HI> to seek to re∣lease
Jesus. He has, before this, related divers at∣tempts
which <HI>Pilate</HI> had made to bring the <HI>Jews</HI> to tem∣per.
What he means hereby is, that he <HI>still</HI> sought to
release him; that upon hearing what Jesus said in this
last examination, he made <HI>another</HI> trial of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
to see, if they could not be contented. Our Lord had
maintained his innocence, told <HI>Pilate</HI> that he could
have no power against him, if it had not been allowed
by the providence of God for particular ends and rea∣sons;
and that they who had delivered him to him,
had been guilty of an heinous and aggravated crime.
<HI>Pilate</HI> therefore, being still satisfied of his innocence,
made one and another attempt afrer this, to bring the
<HI>Jews</HI> to consent to his being released. But at length,
<HI>the voices of them and of the chief Priests prevailed,</HI> Luke
xxiii. 23. <HI>When</HI> Pilate <HI>saw that he could prevail nothing,
but rather a tumult was made,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 24. <HI>then
delivered he him unto them to be crucified,</HI> John xix. 16.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="216"/>
So that, whether the <HI>sear</HI> which seised <HI>Pilate,</HI> upon
the <HI>Jews</HI> telling him, that Jesus had <HI>made himself the
son of God,</HI> was a fear arising from an apprehension,
that he might be some extraordinary person, and more
than a man; or whether it was an apprehension of dis∣turbances
and tumnlts, if he did not hearken to the
<HI>Jews;</HI> yet it is evident from the passages last quoted,
and from many others in the Gospels, that the Evan∣gelists
have represented <HI>Pilate's</HI> condemnation of our
Lord, as exported from him.</P>
<P>HE told them once and again, that he <HI>found no
fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t in him:</HI> he had him scourged, and brought him
out to them, in a mock royal dresse; hoping they
might be satisfied with this punishment and disgrace.
It being his custom at the Passover to release to them
some prisoner of their nation, and the people being ga∣thered
together in great numbers, and now demanding
this favour of him; he proposed to them, that Jesus
might be the person. But they being moved by the
High Priests, <HI>desired that</HI> Barabbas <HI>might be released;</HI>
a criminal so infamous, that no one not void of all
shame would have spoke for him; a. man that had
been taken up in an insurrection against the Roman
Government, and that had committed robbery and
murder. Not being able, by all these methods, to
move the Compassion or equity of the <HI>Jews;</HI> nor ob∣serving
that there was any party among the common
people, that favoured Jesus; and being willing <HI>to con∣tent
the people, he delivered Jesus unto them to be crucisi∣ed,</HI>
Mark xv. 15. The Evangelists are unanimous in
the account, that this sentence was pronounced only <HI>to
content the Jews,</HI> that is, either to secure the peace of
the province, or to maintain his interest with the peo∣ple,
when he saw that nothing could satisfie or appease
their rage, but the death of Jesus. <HI>When</HI> Pilate <HI>saw
that he could prevail nothing; but rather a tumult was
made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent from the blood of this just
person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people and
<PB N="199" REF="217"/>
said, His Bloud be on us and on our children,</HI> Matth.
xxvii. 24, 25. Luke xxiii. 24, 25. John xix. 14—16.</P>
<P>IT will seem strarge to some, that a Roman Go∣vernour
should have any inducements to comply with
the demands of people, contrary to his own judge∣ment
and inclination. But he that considers the ac∣count,
we have of the Principles and behaviour of the
<HI>jewish</HI> nation at this time, will be satisfied, the Evan∣gelists
have here given a just and true representation of
this transaction; and will be convinced, that a Ro∣man
Governour, with all his authority, could not
pass by any thing, which they apprehended to be a
breach on their religious constitution, without ha∣zarding
the peace of his province. All this will not
justifie an unrighteous sentence, but that this was the
case is plain.</P>
<P>WE have seen that the High Priests pretended,
that Jesus had been guilty of blasphemy, in making
<HI>himself the son of God,</HI> and that <HI>by their Law he ought to
die,</HI> John xix. 7. And <HI>Pilate</HI> had had experience of
their prodigious firmnesse and zeal for all the parts of
their religion: there are two particular proofs, they
gave him of this, related by <HI>Jesephus;</HI> the one on oc∣casion
of his placing the Roman Ensigns in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI>
the other upon his attempting to bring water into the
city with money taken out of the sacred Treasury.
The former is related by <HI>Josphus</HI> thus: “<HI>Pilate</HI> the
Prefect of <HI>judea,</HI> sending his army from <HI>Cesarea</HI> and
putting them into winter quarters at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
brought the carved images of <HI>Cesar</HI> which are on
the Ensigns into the City, in violation of the <HI>jewish</HI>
laws; since our Law forbids the making of any
images. For which reason the former governours
were wont to come into the city with ensigns desti∣tute
of those ornaments. <HI>Pilate</HI> was the first, who
set up images in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and he did it privately,
the army making their entry in the night time. But
as soon as the people knew it, they went in a vast
body to <HI>Cesarea,</HI> making earnest supplication for
<PB N="200" REF="218"/>
many days, that the images might be removed. He
not granting their petition, thinking it would be
dishonourable to the Emperour to do so, and they
still persisting in their request to him, on the sixth
day, having privately ordered his soldiers to their
arms, he seated himself on his Tribunal, in the <HI>Cir∣cus,</HI>
near which he had placed his men, that they
might be in readinesse; And when the <HI>Jews</HI> came
to him thither with their petition, his soldiers ha∣ving,
upon a signal given, surrounded them, he
threatned them with immediate death, if they did
nor give over their clamours and return home.
They then threw themselves on the ground, and
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uered their necks to the sword, and said: They
could die much more easily, than they could dare
to do any thing contrary to the wisdom of their
Lawes. <HI>Pilate</HI> surprized at their firmnesse in the
observation of their Laws, immediately gave or∣ders
for bringing back the images from <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
to <HI>Cesarea</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 18. c. 4. §. 1.</NOTE>,”</P>
<P>THERE immediately follows after this an account
of the disturbance raised at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by <HI>Pilate's</HI> at∣tempting
to bring water into the city at the expence of
money taken out of the sacred treasury. <HI>Josephus</HI> says,
That “many thousands got together, crying out,
that he ought to desist from this undertaking; that
many vented most reproachful speeches against him,
—Some were killed and others wounded in this tu∣mult,
but at length the Sedition was suppressed.”</P>
<P>BOTH these attempts of <HI>Pilate</HI> were made at the be∣ginning
of his government. Some learned men, who
suppose that <HI>Pilate</HI> came into <HI>Judea,</HI> A. D. 25, place
them in that year<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cleric. Hist. Ecc.</NOTE> And others, who suppose that
<HI>Pilate</HI> was not Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> till the year 27,
place them there<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Basnage Ann. Pol. Eeel.</NOTE>. I am of opinion, the first at∣tempt
was made by him at the beginning of the first
winter after his arrival in the province, and the
<PB N="201" REF="219"/>
other the summer following. Undoubtedly, he had
seen the <HI>Jews</HI> firmnesse upon both these occasions,
and possibly upon some others, before the time of
the event, which we are considering.</P>
<P>WE have another attempt of <HI>Pilate's,</HI> of the same nature,
mentioned in the letter, which <HI>Agrippa</HI> the elder
sent to <HI>Caligula;</HI> as this letter is given us by <HI>Philo.</HI> In
some particulars it has a great resemblance with the sto∣ry,
<HI>Josephus</HI> has told, of <HI>Pilate's</HI> bringing the <HI>ensigns</HI> in∣to
<HI>jerusalsm;</HI> and in others it is very different from it:
which has given occasion to some learned men to sup∣pose,
that <HI>Philo</HI> has been mistaken<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Basnage Ann. P. E. A. 27. n. 6.</NOTE> For my own
part, as I make no doubt, but <HI>Josephus's</HI> account of
the <HI>ensigns</HI> is true; so I think, that <HI>Philo</HI> may also be
relied on for the truth of a fact, he has mentioned as
happening in his own time in <HI>Judea:</HI> And consequent∣ly
I judge them to be two different facts.</P>
<P>AGRIPPA, reckoning up to <HI>Caligula</HI> the seve∣ral
favours conferred on the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Imperial fa∣mily,
says: “<HI>Pilate</HI> was Procurator of <HI>Judea.</HI> He
not so much out of respect to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as a mali∣cious
intention to vex the people, dedicates gilt
shields and places them in <HI>Herod's</HI> palace within the
holy city. There was no figure upon them, nor
any thing else which is forbidden, except an inscri∣ption,
which expressed these two things, the name
of the person who dedicated them, and of him, to
whom they were dedicated. When the people per∣ceived
what had been done,—they desired this in∣novation
of the shields might be rectified, that their
ancient customs, which had been preserved through
so many ages, and had been hitherto untouched by
Kings and Emperours, might not now be violated.
He refused their demands with roughnesse: such
was his temper, fierce and untractable. They then
cried out, Don't you raise a sedition yourself; Don't
you disturb the peace by your illegal practices.—It
is not <HI>Tiberius's</HI> pleasure, that any of our lawes
<PB N="202" REF="220"/>
should be broken in upon. If you have received
any edict, or letter from the Emperour to this pur∣pose,
produce it, that we may leave you and de∣pute
an ambassy to him, and entreat him to revoke
his orders. This put him out of all temper; for he
was afraid, that if they should send an ambassy,
they might discover the many male-administrations
of his government, his extortions, his unjust decrees,
his inhumane cruelties. This reduced him to the
utmost perplexity. On the one hand, he was afraid
to remove things, that had been once dedicated, and
was also unwilling to do a favour to men that were
his subjects: And on the other hand, he knew ve∣ry
well the inflexible severity of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The chief
men of the nation observing this, and perceiving,
that he repented of what he had done, though he
endeavoured to conceal it, write a most humble
and submissive letter to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> It is needless to
say, how he was provoked, when he had read the
account of <HI>Pilate's</HI> speeches and threatnings; the
event shewing it sufficiently. For he soon sent a let∣ter
to <HI>Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI> reprimanding him for so audacious a
proceeding, requiring also, that the shields should
be removed. And accordingly they were carried
from the metropolis to <HI>Cesarea</HI> by the sea side, cal∣ed
<HI>Sebaste</HI> from your great grandfather, that they
might be placed in the temple there consecrated to
him: and there they were reposited<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Philo de leg. ad Cai. p. 1033, 1034.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE reader doubtless observes the several different
circumstances of this story from that of the <HI>ensigns,</HI>
which <HI>Josephus</HI> has told; and particularly, that this
dedication of the <HI>shields</HI> was made some time after <HI>Pi∣late</HI>
had been in the province; because now he had
been guilty of many male-practices in his government:
whereas the fact, which <HI>Josephus</HI> has related, happen∣ed
very soon after his arrival in the province. This cir∣cumstance
may be an argument, that <HI>Philo</HI> did not
<PB N="203" REF="221"/>
take the <HI>ensigns</HI> for <HI>shields;</HI> it being very unlikely, he
should mistake the time of such an affair.</P>
<P>I cannot however be positive, that this fact happen∣ed
before our Saviour's crucifixion But yet methinks,
it may help us to form an idea, how <HI>Pilate</HI> understood
that threatning speech of the <HI>Jews, If thou let this man
go, thou art not</HI> Cesar's <HI>friend,</HI> John xix. 12. For, sup∣posing
this affair of the <HI>shields</HI> not to have happened till
after our Saviour's crucifixion (which however is not
certain) yet undoubtedly <HI>Pilate</HI> had, before this time,
committed many abuses. And though he might be ve∣ry
well satisfied, the acquitting Jesus and setting him
at liberty would not be deemed any crime, if the case
was fairly stated; yet he might be unwilling to pro∣voke
the principal men of the <HI>jewish</HI> nation to send <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>
an account of his behaviour on other occasions.
This we may the more easily credit, not only because
at all times the remonstrances of a province were very
much dreaded by the Prefects, but because they were
more especially so under <HI>Tiberius;</HI> who was very soli∣citous
for the peace of his provinces, and had endea∣voured
to secure them from the exactions of his offi∣cers.
And it was for this reason, as he himself said,
that he suffered the Presidents to remain in the pro∣vinces
for so long a time, because they all endeavour∣ed
to enrich themselves, and the shorter time they
staid in them, the more eager they were to improve
it to that end<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jos. Ant. lib. xviii. cap. 7. § 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS we see how <HI>Pilate,</HI> a man chiefly swayed by
a regard to his private interest, might be in subjection
to a clamorous and tumultuous people, in an affair,
in which they pretended their religion was concerned.</P>
<P>§. IX. I have in the <HI>second Chapter,</HI> shewn at large,
what power the <HI>jewish</HI> magistracy and the Roman Go∣vernour
were possessed of at this time in <HI>Judea.</HI> But
the justnesse of the Evangelists account upon this head
(in which likewise they are perfectly harmonious) ap∣pears
to me so very material, that I know not how to
<PB N="204" REF="222"/>
forbear making here two or three remarks upon occa∣sion
of <HI>Pilate's</HI> pronouncing the Sentence of condem∣nation
on Jesus; which is a proof of his supreme au∣thority
in that country, in capital causes.</P>
<P>1. ACGORDING to the Evangelists then, the <HI>Jews</HI>
had not now the power of life and death. I have
shewed, that according to other ancient authors, they
had it not at this time, and could not have it, whilst
in the state of a Roman province.</P>
<P>2. ACCORDING to the Evangelists <HI>Pilate</HI> had the
power of life and death. So he has also in <HI>Philo</HI> and
<HI>Josephus.</HI> This is a place, in which later writers would
have been in great danger of tripping. The accura∣cy
of the Evangelists is remarkable on two accounts.
1. <HI>Judea,</HI> though sometimes called a province, was
properly a branch of the province of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ituraeique &amp; Judaei, defunctis regibus <HI>Sohemo</HI> atqne <HI>Agrippa,</HI> PROVINCIAE SYRIAE ADDITI. Tacit. Ann. 12. cap. 23. What <HI>Tacitus</HI> here says, was done upon the death of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> had been the case before his reign: and was so particularly, in the time of <HI>Pilate;</HI> as is evident, in that he was displaced by <HI>Vitellius</HI> Presi∣dent of <HI>Syria.</HI> Vid. &amp; Joseph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 8. §. 1. Antiq. l. xvii. cap. ult. §. 5. &amp; alibi.</NOTE>: But
yet had a Roman Governor residing in it with <HI>supreme</HI>
authority, which was a very uncommon thing. 2. <HI>Pi∣late's</HI>
proper title was that of <HI>Procurator.</HI> The reader
may perceive this from my translations of many pas∣sages
concerning the Roman Governours of <HI>judea,</HI> in
which in conformity to <HI>Josephus's</HI> stile, I also call
them <HI>Procurators. Tacitus</HI> also calls <HI>Pilate Procura∣tor</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ann. 15. cap. 44. See above p. 188. n. h.</NOTE>. Now this was ordinarily the title of the officer
that took care of the Emperour's <HI>revenue</HI> in a pro∣vince,
and is equivalent to that of <HI>Quaestor</HI> under the
Republic, or in a province subject to the Senate; which
officer hid not the power of life and death. But <HI>Pi∣late</HI>
though he had the <HI>title</HI> of Procurator, had the
<HI>Power</HI> of a President. The Evangelists usually give
<HI>Pilate, Felix,</HI> and <HI>Festus</HI> the title of <HI>Governour,</HI> a ge∣neral
word, and very proper according to the usage of
<PB N="205" REF="223"/>
the best writers, and of <HI>Josephus</HI> in particular, in many
places.</P>
<P>3. ACCORDING to the Evangelists, the <HI>jewish</HI>
Council, having, as they pretended, convicted Jesus
of blasphemy, and judged him guilty of death, they
go with him to <HI>Pilate:</HI> and they seem to have expec∣ted,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> should confirm their sentence, and sign
an order, that he might be punished accordingly. And
they afterwards openly and confidently insist: upon it,
that he should not acquit a person, who, they said,
had been guilty of a crime, which, according to their
law, was capital. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>answered him, we have a
law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself the son of God,</HI> John xix. 7. This appears to
me very observable: But yet, nothing is more likely,
than that they should talk in this way; since they were
governed by the <HI>Romans</HI> according to their own lawes;
as I have shewn above<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">See p. 96,</NOTE>. These are the remarks
I had to make in this place.</P>
<P>BUT I would also take this opportunity of adding a
text, not yet insisted on, which, if I understand it
aright, is a fresh indication, that according to the sa∣cred
writers, the <HI>Jews</HI> had not now supreme power
within themselves. When the <HI>jewish</HI> elders had brought
Jesus before <HI>Pilate, he said</HI> to them: <HI>What accusation
bring you against this man? They answered and said unto
him,</HI> IF HE WERE NOT A MALEFACTOR, WE WOULD
NOT HAVE DELIVERED HIM UP UNTO THEE, <HI>John</HI>
xviii. 29, 30. The original word, and our <HI>English</HI>
word <HI>Malefactor,</HI> I think, usually denote a criminal
guilty of one of the worst of crimes: such as are ordi∣narily
punished with death, perpetual imprisonment,
the mines, gallies, or some such very heavy punish∣ment.
These words then, in their mouthes, import
thus much: 1. “If the crime, he is charged with,
were not capital, we should have punished him our
selves, and not have come to you. 2. If he were
<PB N="206" REF="224"/>
not really guilty, we would not have accused him. ”
But to return to the course we were in.</P>
<P>§. X. <HI>PILATE</HI> having at length passed sen∣tence
on Jesus, and delivered him to be crucified, it
will be proper next to consider, what is said of an in∣scription
put upon the crosse. <HI>And</HI> Pilate <HI>wrote a title
and put it on the crosse: and the writing was</HI> JESUS OF
NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS, <HI>John</HI> xix. 19, 20.
This was the usual custom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> when any
were condemned to death, to affix to the instrument of
their punishment, or to order to be carried before them
a writing, expressing the crime for which they sustered.
And this writing was called in <HI>Latin, Title,</HI> which word
St. <HI>John</HI> has made use of. It will be sufficient to give
an example or two of this in the Margin<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Romae publico epulo servum, ob detractam lectis argenteam laminam carnisici confestim tradidit <HI>[Cajus]</HI> ut manibus abscissis, atque ante pectus è collo pendentibus, praecedente titulo qui caussam poenae indicaret per coetus epulantium circumduceretur.

<P>§. XI. ST. <HI>John</HI> says, that this <HI>Title was written in</HI>
Hebrew, Greek, <HI>and</HI> Latin. And it was at this time
usual at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to set up advertisements that were
designed to be read by all sorts of people, in several
languages. <HI>Titus,</HI> in a message he sent to the <HI>Jews</HI> by
<HI>Josephus,</HI> when the city was almost in his hands, and
by which he endeavoured to perswade them to surren∣der,
says: “Did you not erect pillars with inscriptions
on them in the <HI>Greek</HI> and in our language? <HI>Let no
one pass beyond these bounds</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. vi. c. 2. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. XII. EVERY one must needs observe the scoffs
and derisions our Saviour met with. There are three
or four instances recorded in the Evangelists. One was,
whilst he was in the High Priest's house. <HI>Then did they
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
spit in his face, and buffeted him, and others smote him
with the palms of their hands; saying, prophesy unto us
thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?</HI> Matt. xxvi. 67,
68. Mark xiv. 65. <HI>Pilate</HI> hearing our Lord was of
<HI>Galilee</HI> sent him to <HI>Herod;</HI> and before he was dismissed
by him, <HI>Herod with his men of war set him at nought:
and mocked him and arayed him in a gorgeous robe,</HI> Luke
xxiii. 11. He was insulted and mocked by the soldiers,
when <HI>Pilate</HI> ordered him to be scourged the first time,
that by that lesser punishment he might satisfie the <HI>Jews,</HI>
and save his life; as is related by St. <HI>John</HI><NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">John xix. 1, 2. See Dr. <HI>Clark's</HI> paraphrase of these two verses.</NOTE>. After
<HI>Pilate</HI> had condemned him to be crucified, the like in∣dignities
were repeated by the soldiers, as, we are as∣sured
by two Evangelists, <HI>Matt,</HI> xxvii. 27—31. <HI>Mark</HI>
xv. 16—20. <HI>And they stripped him and put on him a
scarlet robe, and when they had platted a crown of thorns,
they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand:
and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, say∣ing,
Hail King of the</HI> Jews. <HI>And they spit upon him, and
took the reed, and smote him on the head.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are tokens of contempt and ridicule, which
were in use at that time. <HI>Dio,</HI> among the other in∣dignities
offered to <HI>Sejanus,</HI> the favourite of <HI>Tiberius</HI>
(in whose reign our Saviour was crucified) as they were
carrying him from the Senate-house to prison, particu∣larly
mentions this; “That they struck him on the
head<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. 58. p. 628. A.</NOTE>.” But there is one instance of ridicule,
which happened so soon after this time, and has so
great a resemblance with what our Saviour met with,
that it ought to be set down here at length. <HI>Caligula,</HI>
the Successor of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> had in the very beginning of
his reign given <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Tetrarchie of his uncle
<HI>Philip,</HI> being about the fourth part of his Grandfather
<HI>Herod's</HI> dominions, with the right of wearing a Diadem
or Crown. When he was setting out from <HI>Rome</HI> to
make a visit to his people, the Emperour advised him
to go by <HI>Alexandria,.</HI> as the best way. When he came
<PB N="208" REF="226"/>
thither, he kept himself very private; but the <HI>Alex∣andrians</HI>
having got intelligence of his arrival there,
and of the design of his Journey, were filled with en∣vy,
as <HI>Philo</HI> says, at the thoughts of a <HI>Jew's</HI> having the
title of <HI>King;</HI> many ways they shewed their indigna∣tion:
One was this:</P>
<P>“THERE was one <HI>Carabas,</HI> a sort of distracted
fellow that in all seasons of the year went naked a∣bout
the streets. He was somewhat between a mad
man and a fool, the common jest of boys, and other
idle people. This wretch they brought into the the∣atre,
and placed him on a lofty seat, that he might
be conspicuous to all: Then they put a thing made
of paper on his head for a crown, the rest of his
body they covered with a matt instead of a Robe,
and for a Sceptre one put into his hand a little piece
of a reed, which he had just taken up from the
ground. Having thus given him a mimic Royal
dresse, several young fellows with poles on their
shoulders came and stood on each side of him as his
guards. Then there came people toward him, some
to pay their homage to him, others to ask justice of
him, and some to know his will and pleasure con∣cerning
affairs of state: and in the croud were loud
and confused acclamations of <HI>Maris, Maris;</HI> that
being, as they say, the <HI>Syriac</HI> word for Lord,
thereby intimating whom they intended to ridicule.
by all this mock shewe<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> In Flacc. p. 970. B. C.</NOTE>; <HI>Agrippa</HI> being a <HI>Syri∣an,</HI>
and King of a large
country in <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Judea is here reckoned by <HI>Philo,</HI> a part of <HI>Syria;</HI> as it is also by many other writers.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. XIII. BEFORE our Saviour was had away to be
crucified, he was <HI>scourged. Then released he</HI> Barabbas
<HI>unto them; and when he had</HI> SCOURGED <HI>Jesus, he deli∣vered
him to be crucified,</HI> Matth, xxvii. 26, <HI>Mark</HI> xv.
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
15. That it was the usual custom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> be∣fore
execution, to scourge persons condemned to ca∣pital
punishment, is evident from many examples re∣corded
in ancient historians. I shall set down from
them in the margin two or three instances in the ori∣ginal
words<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Missique lictores ad sumendum Supplicium, nudatos virgis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aedunt, Liv. lib. ii. c. 5. Productique omnes, virgisque caesi, ac securi percussi. id. lib. 26. c. 15. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. p. 1080. 45. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. p. 1247. 24. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. p. 1327. 43.</NOTE>. Accounts of the executions of Per∣sons
generally run in this form: They were stripped,
whipped, and beheaded or crucified, according as the
sentence was.</P>
<P>§. XIV. ANOTHER particular mentioned here,
is, that our Saviour bore his Crosse. <HI>And they took Je∣sus
and led him away; and he bearing his crosse went
forth,</HI> John xix. 16, 17. But he having been fatigued
by a long examination, and a double scourging (as it
seems), they were obliged after he had gone a short
way, to put it upon another. <HI>And they laid hold on one</HI>
Simon a Cyrenian: <HI>and on him they laid the cross, that he
might bear it after Jesus,</HI> Luke xxiii. 26. Mark xv. 21.</P>
<P>THIS was the constant practise among the <HI>Romans,</HI>
for criminals to carry their own crosse. Insomuch that
<HI>Plutarch</HI> makes use of it as an illustration of the miserie
of vice: “that every kind of wickednesse produces
its own particular torment, just as every malefactor,
when he is brought forth to execution, carries his
own crosse<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Plu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch. de iis qui sero puniuntur. p. 554. A. Paris. 1624.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. XV. IT appears from the Evangelists that our
Lord was crucified without the City. <HI>And he bearing
his cross went forth to a place called the place of a skull,
which is called in the</HI> Hebrew Golgotha, <HI>John</HI> xix. 17.
<HI>For the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the
city,</HI> ver. 20. And the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> has
<PB N="210" REF="228"/>
listewise mentioned this circumstance: <HI>Wherefore Jesus
also—suffered without the gate,</HI> Heb. xiii. 12.</P>
<P>THIS is conformable to the <HI>jewish</HI> Law, and to
examples mentioned in the <HI>Old Testament. And the
Lord said unto</HI> Moses, <HI>the man shall surely be put to
death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
with out the camp,</HI> Numb xv. 35. <HI>Then they carried him</HI>
[Naboth] <HI>forth out of the City, and stoned him with
stones, that he died,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 13. This was done at
<HI>Jesreel,</HI> in the territories of the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> not far
from <HI>Samaria.</HI> And if this custom was practised there,
we may be certain, the <HI>Jews</HI> did not choose that cri∣minals
should be executed within <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the sanc∣tity
of which they had so high an opinion of, and
which they were very zealous to preserve free from all
ceremonial impurity, though they defiled it with the
practise of the most horrid immoralities. It is possible
indeed, they might, in their sudden and ungoverned
rage, a thing they were mighty subject to at this
time, upon any affront offered to their Lawes or Cus∣toms,
put persons, who thus provoked them, to death,
upon the Spot, in the City, or the Temple, or where∣ever
they found them: But whenever they were calm
enough to admit the form of a legal processe, I dare
say, they did not approve of an execution within the
City.</P>
<P>AND among the <HI>Romans</HI> this custom was very com∣mon<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Plautus in Milite glorioso, Act. ii. Seen. 4. Credo ego istoc exemplo tibi esse eundum actutum extra portam, dispessis manibus patibulum cum habebis.</NOTE>, at lest in the provinces. The Robbers at
<HI>Ephesus,</HI> which<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Quum interim Imperator pro∣vinciae latrones jussit crucibus adfigi, secundum illam eandem casu∣lam, in qua recens cadaver matrona deflebat. Satyr. c. 71.</NOTE> <HI>Petronius Arbiter</HI> mentions, were
crucified by order of the Governour of the province
without the city. This was the custom likewise in
<HI>Sicily;</HI> as appears from <HI>Cicero</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Quid enim attinuit, cum Mamertini more atque instituto suo crucem fixissent post urbem in via Pompeia: te jubere in ea parte figere, quae ad fretum spectaret? in Verr. lib. v. c. 66. n. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="229"/>
§. XVI. <HI>ALL the four Evangelists have particu∣larly
mentioned our Saviour's</HI> burial: that Joseph of
<HI>Arimathea</HI> went to <HI>Pilate,</HI> and begged the body of Jesus;
Then <HI>Pilate</HI> commanded the body to be delivered. And
when <HI>Joseph</HI> had taken the body, he laid it in his own
new tomb, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvii. 58—60. <HI>Mark</HI> xv. 45—46.
<HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 50—53. <HI>John</HI> xix. 38—40. <HI>And it may
be fairly concluded, the rulers of the</HI> Jews <HI>did not
disapprove of it: Since they were solicitous, that the
bodies might be taken down, and not hang on the
crosse the next day.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore, <HI>says St.</HI> John.,
because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not
remain on the crosse on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath
day was an high day) besought <HI>Pilate,</HI> that their legs
might be broken, and that they might be taken away,
<HI>John</HI> xix. 30.</P>
<P>BURIAL was not always allowed, by the <HI>Romans</HI>
in these cases. For we find, that sometimes a soldier
was appointed to gaurd the bodies of malefactors, that
they might not be taken away and buried<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Miles Cruces asservabat, ne quis ad sepulturam copora detra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eret. Petron. Arb. Satyr. c. 71.</NOTE>. Howe∣ver
it seems, that it was not often refused, unless the
criminals were very mean and infamous. <HI>Cicero</HI> re∣ckons
it one of the horrid crimes of <HI>Verres's</HI> admini∣stration
in <HI>Sicily,</HI> that he would take money of pa∣rents
for the burial of their children, whom he had
put to death<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rapiunt eum ad suppli∣cium dii patrii: quod iste inventus est, qui e complexu parentum abreptos filios ad necem duceret, &amp; parentes pretium pro sepultura posceret. In Verr. lib. I. cap. 3.</NOTE>. Both <HI>Suetonius</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nemo punitorum non &amp; in Gemonias abjectus uncoque tractus, Vit.

it, as one of the uncommon cruelties of <HI>Tiberius</HI>
in the latter part of his reign, that he generally denied
burial to those who were put to death by his orders at
<HI>Rome. Ulpian,</HI> in his treatise of the <HI>Duty of a Proconsul,</HI>
says: “The bodies of those who are condemned to
death, are not to be denied to their relations:' And
<PB N="212" REF="230"/>
<HI>Augustus writes in the tenth book of his own life, that he
had been, wont to observe this custom</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Corpora eorum qui capite damnantur cognatis ipsorum neganda non sunt: &amp; id se observasse etiam D. Aug. lib. x. de vitâ suâ, scri∣bit. Hodie autem eorum, in quos animadvertitur, corpora non ali∣ter sepeliuntur, quam si fuerit petitum &amp; permissum: &amp; nonnun∣quam non permittitur, maxime majestatis causâ damnatorum, l. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de cadaver Punit.</NOTE>; ” that is, to
grant the bodies to relations. <HI>Paulus</HI> says, that “the
bodies of those who have been punished <HI>[with death]</HI>
are to be given to any that desire them in order to
burial<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Corpora animadversorum quibussi∣bet petentibus ad sepulturam danda sunt, l. 3. eod.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is evident therefore from these two lawyers, that
the Governours of provinces had a right to grant burial
to the bodies of those who had been executed by their
order: Nay they seem to intimate, that it ought not
usually to be denied, when requested by any.</P>
<P>WE may then depend upon it, that burial was or∣dinarily
allowed to persons put to death in <HI>Judea.</HI> The
lawe of <HI>Moses</HI> is express, that malefactors should be
buried. <HI>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of
death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a
tree, his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but
thou shalt in any wise bury him that day—that thy land be
not defiled,</HI> Deut. xxi. 22, 23. And the later <HI>Jews</HI> re∣tained
a reverence for this lawe. A body of the <HI>Idu∣means</HI>
having been let into <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by the zealots, in
order to strengthen their party; after the mention of
very great barbarities they had committed in the city,
and in the temple, <HI>Josephus</HI> gives their neglect to bury
those whom they had murdered, as one of the strongest
proofs of their wickednesse. “They came, <HI>says he,</HI>
to such impiety, as to throwe out men unburied,
though the <HI>Jews</HI> had so great concern for burial, as
to take down and bury before sun-set those who
who were crucified by a legal sentence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. 4. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>.” Since
<PB N="213" REF="231"/>
burial was so strictly required by the Mosaical lawe,
and was so agreeable to the sentiments and inclinations
of the <HI>jewish</HI> people; we have all the reason in the
world to suppose, it was seldome denied by the Roman
Governors in that country.</P>
<P>§. <HI>XVII. ST.</HI> John <HI>says</HI> [Ch. xix. 39, 40.] There
came also <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and brought a mixture of myrrhe
and aloes, about an hundred found weight. Then took
they [Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus] the body of
Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes, with the spices, as
the manner of the <HI>Jews</HI> is to bury. <HI>This may seem to
some a large quantity of spices, to be bestowed on a
single body at its interment. And it has been made
an objection by a Modern</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amram,</HI> in B. <HI>Kidder,</HI> affirms, that this was enough for two hundred dead bodies, and that it could not be carried with less than the strength of a mule, and therefore not by <HI>Nicodemus. kidder's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emonstrat. of the Messias,</HI> Part III. ch. iii. §. 11.</NOTE> Jew <HI>against the history
of the</HI> New Testament. <HI>And yet according to St.</HI> Mark
<HI>[Ch. xvi 1.] and St.</HI> Luke <HI>[Ch. xxiii.</HI> 55, 56.] Mary
Magdelene, <HI>and some other women, having observ'd</HI>
the sepulchre, and where the body was laid, <HI>went and</HI>
bought sweet spices, that they might anoint him. And on
the first day of the week, early in the morning, they came
to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had pre∣pared.</P>
<P>BUT the largenesse of this quantity will not sur∣prize
any, who consider the <HI>jewish</HI> custom; and that
they were wont not only to embalm, or <HI>anoint</HI> the
body, but to lay it also in a bed of spices. 'Tis said
<HI>of Asa</HI> [2 Chron. xvi. 14.] <HI>They buried him in the bed
which was filled with sweet odors, and divers kinds of
spices prepared by the apothecaries art: and they made a
very great burning for him.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> of this time seem
not to have fallen short of their ancestors in this kind
of expense. For <HI>Josephus</HI> in the account of <HI>Herod's</HI>
funeral procession says: “The Soldiery was followed
by five hundred slaves and freed-men bearing sweet

<HI>War,</HI> and in the <HI>Antiquities.</HI> 'Tis likely there were
spi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es here for a <HI>burning,</HI> as well as for a bed to lay
<HI>Herod's</HI> body in.</P>
<P>It is likewise objected by the same <HI>Jew,</HI> that the
quantity of spices mention'd by St. <HI>John</HI> was a load
for a mule; and therefore could not be carried by
<HI>Nicodemus.</HI> One would not have expected such an ob∣jection
from a reasonable creature, Who might know

speaking, to ascribe to any person that which is done

the implacable malice of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> not only against our Saviour,
but also against the Apostles; and
the heat and rage with which they opposed them, not
only in <HI>Judea,</HI> but likewise in all other countries where
they met with them, because they did not practise, and
recommend all their particular, rites and traditions.
But the Roman Officers and Governours were far from
being equally offended with the neglect they shewed of
their religion, and usually protected them from the in∣juries
the <HI>Jews</HI> would have done them.</P>
<P><HI>AT</HI> Thessalonica, The <HI>Jews</HI> which believed not, moved
with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser
sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an
uproar, and assaulted the house of <HI>Jason,</HI> and sought to
<PB N="216" REF="234"/>
bring them [<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>] out to the people. And when
they found them not, they drew <HI>Jason</HI> and certain of the
brethren, unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that
have turned the world upside down, are come hither also.
whom <HI>Jason</HI> has received, and these all do contrary to the
decrees of <HI>Cesar,</HI> saying, that there is another king, one
Jesus. And they troubled the people and the rulers of the
city, when they heard these things. And when they had
taken security of <HI>Jason</HI> and the other [brethren] they let
them go, <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 5.-9. <HI>This was a piece of great

<HI>and those with him, but took their security, that</HI> Paul
<HI>and</HI> Silas <HI>should appear, if called for; which it is like∣ly,</HI>
they never were.</P>
<P>S T. <HI>Paul</HI> preached a year and six months at <HI>Corinth,</HI>
and the JEWS commenced a warm prosecution against
him. But it was impossible to move <HI>Gallio,</HI> elder Bro∣ther

when</HI> Gallio <HI>was deputy of</HI> Achaia, <HI>the</HI> JEWS MADE INSUR∣RECTION
WITH OXE ACCORD <HI>against</HI> Paul, <HI>and brought
him to the judgment seat; saying, This fellow perswadeth
men to worship God contrary to the Law. And when</HI> Paul
<HI>was now about to open his mouth,</HI> Gallio <HI>said unto the</HI>
Jews, <HI>If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdnesse, O
ye</HI> Jews, <HI>reason would that I should bear with you. But if
it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
look ye to it, for I will be no judge of fuck matters. And

<P><HI>AT</HI> Ephesus, Demetrius <HI>a silversmith,</HI> which made
silver shrines for <HI>Diana,</HI> with the workmen of like occupa∣tion
<HI>made a speech to the people, in behalf of themselves
and their Goddesse; insomuch, that</HI> the whole city was
filled with confusior, and having caught <HI>Gaius</HI> and <HI>Aristar∣chus,</HI>
men of <HI>Macedonia, Paul's</HI> companions in travel,
<PB N="217" REF="235"/>
they rushed with one accord into the theatre. And when <HI>Paul</HI>
would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered
him not. <HI>And</HI> certain of the <HI>CHIEF OF ASIA,</HI> which were
his friends, sent unto him; desiring him that he would not
adventure himself into the theatre, <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 24-31.</P>
<P>By <HI>the chief men of Asia,</HI> or <HI>Asiarchs,</HI> as it is in the
<HI>Greek</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, we are to understand the Rulers of the games
of <HI>Asia</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. &amp; Whith. in loc. Basnage Ann. Polit. Ecc. A. 55. n. 7.</NOTE>. It is generally supposed, they were priests.
But if they were not always priests, it is certain, that
the Rulers of Games were magistrates of considerable
wealth and reputation. And it was a piece of civility
in them to send <HI>Paul</HI> a message from the theatre to ad∣vise
him of the temper of the people, and to disswade
him from coming thither.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Town-Clerk <HI>went yet farther, for he repri∣manded
the people, who had been drawn into a riot by</HI>
Demetrius <HI>and the other artificers, and their work∣men:
assuring them, they might depend upon having
justice done them according to the lawe, but that for
this assembly they had deserved to be punished.</HI> And
when the town-clerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye
men of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> what man is there that knoweth not,
how that the city of the <HI>Ephesians</HI> is a worshipper of the
great goddess <HI>Diana?</HI>-seeing then, that these things can∣not

are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your

a matter against any man, the law is open; and
there are deputies, let them implead one another. But if
ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be
determined in a lawful assembly. For we are in danger

<P>WHEN the <HI>Jews</HI> had seised St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
with intent to kill him; neither <HI>Lysias</HI> the chief captain
there, <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. nor <HI>Felix</HI> the governour, to whom
<HI>Lysias</HI> sent him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiv. nor <HI>Festus</HI> his successor
would condemn him, though earnestly importuned by
the <HI>Jews,</HI> Ch. xxv.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Paul</HI> had made but a short progresse in his
voyage from <HI>Cesarea</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> before he received a
particular civility from <HI>Julius a centurion of</HI> Augustus
<HI>band,</HI> to whom he and the other prisoners were com∣mitted.
<HI>And entring into a ship of</HI> Adramytium <HI>we
lanched, meaning to sail by the coasts of</HI> Asia.- <HI>And the
next day we touched at</HI> Sidon. <HI>And</HI> Julius COURTEOUSLY
ENTREATED PAUL, <HI>and gave him liberty to go unto his
friends to refresh himself,</HI> Acts xxvii. 2, 3.</P>
<P><HI>WHEN the Apostle and his company were ship∣wrecked
in their voyage to</HI> Rome, <HI>the soldiers formed
a design</HI> to kill the prisoners, lest they should escape. But
the <HI>(forementioned)</HI> centurion, <HI>who had the charge of
them,</HI> kept them from their purpose, being willing to save
<HI>Paul,</HI> Acts xxvii. 42, 43.</P>
<P><HI>AND when he came to</HI> Rome, <HI>he was well used there.</HI>
The Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the
guard: but <HI>Paul</HI> was suffered to dwell by himself with a
soldier that kept him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxviii. 16. There he dwelt two
whole years in his own hired house, and received all that
came in unto him, preaching the kingdome of God and
teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ
with all considence, no man forbidding him, <HI>ver.</HI> 30, 31.
<HI>And there is no doubt, but that he was quite freed
from these bonds, and travelled again into</HI> Asia, <HI>Phil.</HI>
3. 25. ii. 19.</P>
<P>WE have here not one only, but many instances of
lenity, or justice at lest, in the Roman Officers and
Governours, toward <HI>Paul</HI> and other the first followers
of Jesus: Some in one place, and some in another: At
<PB N="219" REF="237"/>
<HI>Thessalonica, Corinth, Ephssus,</HI> in <HI>Judea,</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI>
These officers withstood the tumults, remonstrances,
solicitations of the <HI>Jews</HI> of all characters, and of the
common people of their own religion.</P>
<P>THESE facts did not all happen in one and the same
reign. <HI>Pilate</HI> made some efforts to set <HI>Jesus</HI> at liberty
in the reign of <HI>Tiberius. Gallio</HI> was deputy of <HI>Achaia</HI>
under <HI>Claudius. Felix</HI> was sent into <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Claudius;</HI>
but the justice, which he and <HI>Festus</HI> did <HI>Paul,</HI> was in
the time of <HI>Nero.</HI> And it was from the Captain of the
guard, or chief favourite of this same Emperour,
that he received so good treatment at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>IF <HI>Gallio</HI> only, who was a man of much wit and
good sense<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dion. Cass. lib. lxi. p. 689. init.</NOTE>, and of a sweet and gentle disposition<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Nemo enim mortalium uni tam dulcis est quam hic omnibus. Senec. Nat. Quaest. l. iv. in Praef</NOTE>,
and, (if we may credit his brother,) of much gene∣rosity
and vertue<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Solebam tibi dicere, Gallionem fratrem meum (quern nemo non parum amat, etiam qui amare plus non potest) alia vitia non nosse, hoc etiam odisse.—Hoc quoque loco blanditiis tuis restitit, ut exclamares invenisse te inexpugnabilem virum adversus insidias, quas nemo non in sinum recipit. id. ibid.</NOTE>, had protected the first followers
of Jesus from the injuries which were offered them,
we might have ascribed such conduct to his eminent
qualifications. But <HI>Felix</HI> was infamous for his exacti∣ons
and other crimes, not in <HI>Judea</HI> only, but at <HI>Rome.</HI>
And yet he could not be brought to condemn <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>NOT that I think, that <HI>Felix</HI> did <HI>Paul</HI> all the justice
he ought to have done: far from it. After the first
hearing of <HI>Paul</HI> and the chief priests and elders at <HI>Ce∣sarea,</HI>
he ought to have released him: and his detain∣ing
an innocent man in prison, so long as he did <HI>Paul,</HI>
and leaving him in chains, when he went out of the
province, were very unrighteous actions.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>But after two years</HI> Portius Festus
<HI>came into</HI> Felix <HI>room: and</HI> Felix <HI>willing to</HI> SHEW THE
JEWS A PLEASURE, <HI>left</HI> Paul <HI>bound,</HI> Acts xxiv. 37. I
believe, that <HI>Felix</HI> at this time shewed the <HI>Jews</HI> a dou∣ble
<PB N="220" REF="238"/>
pleasure; released robbers and other criminals,
and <HI>left Paul bound.</HI> The former pleasure St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
omitted, according to his great candour and modera∣tion
observable upon divers occasions in other parts of
his history. But I make very little doubt, but it was
now done. <HI>Josepus</HI> has particularly taken notice that
<HI>Albinus,</HI> Successor of <HI>Porcius Festus,</HI> did so, when he
left the province: and that he aimed at pleasing the
<HI>Jews</HI> in it. <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that thereby the prisons were
emptied, but the country was filled with robbers.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. 20. c. 8. §. 5.</NOTE>.
<HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Albinus</HI> were both of them disagreeable in
their administration. It is likely, they both took the
same method of pacisying the <HI>Jews</HI> at the conclusion.
Perhaps <HI>Felix's</HI> conduct was the pattern <HI>Albinus</HI> follow∣ed:
nor was it, I suppose, an uncommon thing for
Governours to release some prisoners at their leaving
a province.</P>
<P>PORCIUS FESTUS was also manifestly un∣just to
<HI>Paul,</HI> in that he did not set him at liberty, but
constrained him to appeal to <HI>Cesar.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though they did not do <HI>Paul</HI> all the justice
they ought to have done; yet they did not condemn
him to death, as the <HI>Jews</HI> desired. It is plain, they
withstood very pressing sollicitations, and possibly,
considerable offers of money. <HI>Felix</HI> gave him a great
deal of liberty, after the first hearing at <HI>Cesarea:</HI> Acts
xxiv. 23. which, we may suppose, was also allowed by
<HI>seftus.</HI> Though they had neither of them resolution
enough to release <HI>Paul</HI> against the inclinations of the
people of their province, they both give plain indica∣tions,
they thought him an innocent man. And it
cannot be questioned, but that <HI>Festus</HI> transmitted a fa∣vourable
account of him to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to find out the true reason and foundation
of this conduct, I mean, of the favour shewed to the
disciples of Jesus by the Roman officers; it is needful
to consider the grounds they go upon, and the rea∣sons
they themselves assign for it, as represented by
<HI>St. Luke.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="239"/>
<HI>THE reader will recollect the speeches of</HI> Gallio,
<HI>and the town clerk of</HI> Ephesus; <HI>so that I need not re∣peat
any part of them here. The substance of them
all is, in short, in the letter, which</HI> Lysias <HI>sent with</HI>
Paul to Felix at Cesarea. And when I would have known
the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth
into their council, whom I perceived to be accused of que∣stions
of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge
worthy of death, or of bonds, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. 28, 29.</P>
<P><HI>AND with this agrees also the account which</HI> Festus
<HI>gave of</HI> Paul's <HI>affair at length to King</HI> Agrippa. And
after certain days, King <HI>Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Bernice</HI> came unto
<HI>Cesarea</HI> to salute <HI>Festus.</HI> And when they had been there
many days, <HI>Festus</HI> declared <HI>Paul's</HI> cause unto the King,
saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by <HI>Felix.</HI> A∣bout
whom, when I was at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the chief priests
and the elders of the <HI>Jews</HI> informed me, desiring to have
judgment against him. To whom I answered, It is not the
manner of the <HI>Romans</HI> to deliver any man to die, before
that he which is accused have the accusers face to face.—
Therefore when they were come hither, without any delay,
on the morrow I sat on the judgment Seat, and I command∣ed
the man to be brought forth. Against whom, when the
accusers stood up, they brought none accusations of such
things as I supposed: but had certain questions against him
of their own superstition, and of one jesus, which was dead,
whom <HI>Paul</HI> affirmed to be alive. And because I doubted
of such manner of questions, I asked him, whether he would
go to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and there be judged of these matters. But
when <HI>Paul</HI> had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> I commanded him to be kept till I might send
him to <HI>Cesar.</HI> Then <HI>Agrippa</HI> said unto <HI>Festus,</HI> I would
also hear the man myself:—And on the morrow, when
<HI>Agrippa</HI> was come, and <HI>Bernice,</HI> with great pomp,—
at <HI>Festus</HI> commandment <HI>Paul</HI> was brought forth. And
<HI>Festus</HI> said, King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and all men which are here
present. with us, Ye see this man, about whom <HI>ALL</HI> the
multitude of the <HI>Jews</HI> have dealt with me, both at <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI>
and also here, crying, that he ought not to live any
<PB N="222" REF="240"/>
longer. But when I found that he had committed nothing
worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to
<HI>Augustus,</HI> I have determined to send him. Of whom <HI>I
HAVE NO CERTAIN THING TO WRITE UNTO MY LORD:</HI>
Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and espe∣cially
before thee, 0 King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> that after examina∣tion
had <HI>I MIGHT HAVE SOMEWHAT TO WRITE.</HI> For
it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
withal to signifie ths crimes laid against him, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv.
13-27.</P>
<P>STRANGE! <HI>Felix,</HI> it is likely, left behind him
some memorial concerning this prisoner, and <HI>Festus</HI>
had given <HI>Paul</HI> and his accusers a solemn hearing at
<HI>Cefarea:</HI> The high priest and elders and all the multi∣tude
of the <HI>Jews</HI> had dealt with him about <HI>Paul</HI> once
and again, at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and at <HI>Cesarea: Festus</HI> seems
to have spared no pains to go to the bottom of the
matter: and yet, after all, he brought him before
<HI>Agrippa</HI> that he <HI>might have somewhat to write to Au∣gustus.</HI> According to this account, the <HI>Roman Empire</HI>
must have had no Jaws, at this time, against new sects
in religion, or the leaders of them; provided they in∣jured
no man's civil property, and gave no distur∣bance
to other people in their worship.</P>
<P>LET us however see the progresse of this <HI>examination</HI>
before <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and <HI>Bernice,</HI> and those who were with
them. <HI>Paul</HI> acquaints them with the manner of his
life from the first, informs them of his conversion,
freely declares his principles and conduct; tells them,
that he had <HI>seen a light from heaven, and heard a voice;</HI>
that he had been sent unto the <HI>Gentiles, to open their
eyes, and to turn them from darknesse to light, that they
might receive forgivenesse of sins, and inheritance among
them that are santified by faith that is in Jesus.</HI> He lets
them know, that he had not been <HI>disobedient to the
heavenly vision, but shewed first unto them of</HI> Damascus,
<HI>and at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and throughout all the coasts of</HI> Judea,
<HI>and then to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they should repent and turn
to God;</HI>—<HI>that having obtained help of God, he continued
<PB N="223" REF="241"/>
unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, that
Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that
should rise from the dead, and should Jhew light unto the
people and to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 13-23</P>
<P><HI>PAUL</HI> here acknowledgeth two things most con∣trary
to the general opinion of the <HI>Jews</HI> at that time;
<HI>First, That Christ should suffer;</HI> and <HI>secondly,</HI> He men∣tions
particularly his commission <HI>to go to the Gentiles;</HI>
which thing when he related in his speech to the people
at <HI>Jerusalem, they lift up their voices, and said, Away
with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he
should live,</HI> Acts xxii. 22, 23. And he now declares,
that he had propagated these principles every where
with all his might.</P>
<P>WELL, what is the result? Why truly, <HI>Paul's</HI> dis∣course
appears to <HI>Fejtus</HI> so extravagant, that he tells
him he was <HI>beside</HI> himself; only he softens the charge a
little, by subjoining, that it was <HI>much learning</HI> that
<HI>made him mad.</HI> But still there was no <HI>crime</HI> discerned.
Nay, after all this, <HI>Paul</HI> had the presence of mind to
deliver a solemn wish, that not only <HI>Agrippa,</HI> but also
<HI>all that heard him that day, were not only almost but alto∣gether
such as he was except</HI> his <HI>bonds. And when he had
thus spoken, the king rose up, and</HI> Bernice, <HI>and they that
sat with them. And when they were gone aside, they talk∣ed
between themsehes, saying, this man doth nothing wor∣thy
of death or of bonds. Then said Agrippa</HI> (a <HI>Jew,</HI> but
well acquainted with the Roman Constitution) <HI>This
man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appeal∣ed
unto</HI> Cesar, <HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 30, 32.</P>
<P>THE summ, I think, is this; that since St. <HI>Paul</HI> had
affirmed in his desense before <HI>Felix,</HI> that <HI>they had not
found him in the temple disputing with any man, neither
raising up the people, neither in the synagogues nor in the city;</HI>
Acts xxiv, 12. and before <HI>Festus,</HI> that <HI>neither against the
law, neither against the temple, nor yet against</HI> Cesar, <HI>had
he offended any thing at all:</HI> Ch. xxv. 8. And, since the
<HI>Jews</HI> had brought no proofs of any such offenses; but
only there were some differences between <HI>Paul</HI> and the
<PB N="224" REF="242"/>
<HI>Jews,</HI> concerning <HI>certain questions of their own supersti∣tion</HI>
[religion]; <HI>Paul</HI> was an innocent man, and might
have been very justly set at liberty, and left to him∣self
to go and propagate his principles in the way he
had done hitherto.</P>
<P>THIS then was the reason of this conduct, they
were not used to interpose their authority in differences
purely religious: There was no act of sedition, inju∣stice,
or violence proved against <HI>Paul,</HI> or any of his
companions: And these were the only things, which
these officers had a right to punish.</P>
<P>HERE are therefore two things, which we are to'
look for some foreign proof of; namely, the fierce op∣position
made by the <HI>Jews</HI> against the followers of
Jesus Christ; and then, in the next place, that the
Roman officers had no right, according to the consti∣tution
of the Roman government at that time, to pu∣nish
men for innocent principles, but only for wicked
practises.</P>
<P>§. II. To the first point, the proceedings of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> little needs to be said. Their character<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) Dio. l. 49. D. p. 405.</NOTE> for
violence is so allowed, that no one can well suspect the
Evangelists have misrepresented them: not to say,
that it was by no means their interest to say these
things of them, if not true. I shall however allege a
passage or two to this purpese. <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> in his
Dialogue with <HI>Trypbo,</HI> writ about the 140th<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. C. 148.</NOTE> year
of the Christian <HI>Aera,</HI> says, that in his time, “the
<HI>Jews</HI> cursed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dialog. p. 234. B.</NOTE> in their Synagogues all that believed
in Christ. This <HI>soys he,</HI> is all you can do. You have
not now the power of killing us yourselues, because
others have the government of things. But this you
have done, whenever you have been able. Nor have
any other people shewed so much enmity against us
<PB N="225" REF="243"/>
and Christ as you, who have been like wise the au∣thors
of all those prejudices, which others havecon∣ceived
against that righteous person and us his fol∣lowers.
For after that you had crucified that one
unblameable and righteous man (by whose stripes
they are healed who go to the father through him)
when you knew, that he was risen from the dead,
and ascended up into “heaven, according as the pro∣phecies
had foretold he should; you were so far
from repenting of your evil deeds, that you sent out
from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> chosen men into all the world, giving
out that the sect of the Christians is atheistical, and
saying all those evil things of us, which they, who
know us not, do still say of us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. CD.</NOTE>. ” And <HI>Tertullian</HI>
affirms the same thing: that the <HI>Jews</HI> were the prin∣cipal
authors of the evil reports, which were spread
abroad concerning the Christians<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Et crediditvulgus Judaeo. Quod enim aliud genus seminarium est infamiae nostrae? Tertul. ad Nat. 1. 1. c,. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“. III. MODERATION and equity toward men of
a different religion are more uncommon things. And
therefore, it will be needful to be more particular on
this head, and to account for the protection, which.
the Heathen officers gave St. <HI>Paul</HI> and others, when
the multitude would have mobbed them, or when the
<HI>jewish</HI> Magistrates demanded a judicial sentence against
them.</P>
<P>I shall therefore shew that the Roman People did at
this time protect all men in the practise of their seve∣ral
religious rites and institutions.</P>
<P>IN the first place, I shall consider, how they treat∣ed
the Heathen people in those provinces which they
had subdued.</P>
<P>AND secondly. I shall give a brief account of the
treatment, which the <HI>Jews</HI> received from them.</P>
<P>1. I shall consider how they treated the Heathen
people, in those provinces, which they subdued to
their obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="244"/>
<HI>LIVIE</HI> informs us, that the <HI>Anagnini,</HI> a people
in <HI>Italie,</HI> having disobliged the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Senate
took away from them several privileges, which they
had let them enjoy to that time. “Their senates were
dissolved, and their Magistrates were deprived of
all power and authority, except what was necessary
for the administration of their religious rites<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Anagninis, quique arma Romanis intulerant—concilia, con∣nubiaq; adepta: &amp; magistratibus, praeterquam sacrorum curatione, interdictum. Liv. lib. ix. cap. 43. n. 24.</NOTE>.”
This was done in the year of the City 449, before
Christ 305; and is a proof, that they esteemed all
mens religion inviolable.</P>
<P>THE people of <HI>Syacuse</HI> in <HI>Sicilie</HI> had an ancient
custom of choosing an annual priest to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> It is
one of the heavy charges, which <HI>Cicero</HI> brings against
<HI>Verres,</HI> that whilst he was Praetor of that province,
he had obstructed the people there, in the usual me∣thod
of the choice, in order to get into the priesthood
a creature of his own<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">—Sacerdotia: quibus in rebus non solum jura, sed etiam deorum rdigiones immortalium omnes repudiavit. Syricusis lex est de religione, quae in annos singulos Jovis sacerdotem sortito capi ju∣bebat, &amp;c. in Verr. lib. ii. cap. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>VERRES</HI> had a strong fansie for fine statues<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Deum denique nullum Siculis, qui ei paullo magis affabre atque artificio factus videretur, reliquit. in Verr. act. 1. c. 5. n. 14.</NOTE>:
And, whenever he had seen any such in any town or
city, as he travelled in his province, he would send to
the people, and inform them of a desire he had to pur∣chase
of them the Statue of such or such a God or God∣desse.
Sometimes the people out of fear of his resent∣ments
complied with his desires, though with much
regret. But others were more resolute, and told him
plainly, such things could not be done without im∣piety.
However this wretch (as <HI>Cicero</HI> says) would
send his servants in the night time to (real images
which the people refused to part with. There was a
statue of <HI>Ceres</HI> at <HI>Enna,</HI> which stood in an open place
before her temple. “The curious workmanship of it
<PB N="227" REF="245"/>
was a strong temptation, but its bulk obstructed a
clandestine removal. She held in her right hand a
beautiful image of Victory. This he caused to be

what <HI>Cicero</HI> says to the Judges upon the Trial of <HI>Ver∣ns.</HI>
“Heal, O ye Judges, the wounds given to the
religion of your Allies, preserve your own. For
this is not the branch of any foreign or strange reli∣gion.
But if it were, and if you did not see fit to
adopt it into your own religion; yet you ought to
be willing to secure it by an exemplary punishment
of him who has offered to violate it<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Medemini religioni sociorum, judices: conservate vestram.

<P>OF all Heathen rites within the bounds of the <HI>Ro∣man

different from those of the <HI>Romans.</HI> They were con∣temned

And if we may credit <HI>Philo,</HI> no strangers came into

pity<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo de decalogo. p. 755. E.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT yet they were practised without any molesta∣tion

<P>IT is true, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> rites were more than once
prohibited in the City of <HI>Rome. Augustus</HI> “laid a
restraint upon them and forbade the performing
them in the City, or suburbs, or within five hun∣dred
paces of the suburbs<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. 54. p. 525. A.</NOTE>.” And by <HI>Tiberius's</HI>

and her Image thrown into the <HI>Tiber</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. lib. xviii. cap. 4. §. 4.</NOTE>.” But then,
this was for an high oftense; and because her priests
under the cloke of religion, had promoted acts of de∣bauchery,
which were ruinous of the peace of fami∣lies,
and that in the very temple itself which she had
at <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Flaccus</HI> the president of <HI>Egypt,</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo in Flac. p. 965. D.</NOTE> in the

they met with no interruptions.</P>
<P>AND those sacred rites, which were more properly
their own, were as severely restrained, when they were
known to be abused to the like infamous practises. For
this reason the <HI>Bacchanalia</HI> were prohibited at <HI>Rome</HI>

<P>THAT I may not enter into needless particulars, I
shall take notice here of but one thing more. <HI>Philo</HI>
says, that when the <HI>Jews</HI> waited on <HI>Petronius</HI> president
of <HI>Syria,</HI> to entreat him, not to proceed as yet, to
erect the statue of <HI>Caligula</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> they desired
that he would give them leave to send an ambassy to
the Emperour: “Possibly, <HI>say they,</HI> we may obtain
thus much; not to be treated worse than the mean∣est
of all people, whose religion is preserved invio∣lable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo de Leg. ad Cai. p. 1026. E.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. IV. IN the <HI>second</HI> place, I shall give a brief ac∣count
of the treatment, which the <HI>Jews</HI> had from the
<HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> received very considerable favours and
privileges from <HI>Alexander;</HI> and they enjoyed the same
under his Successors in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> though with
some interruptions, especially in <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. Ant. lib. xii, cap. 3. §. 1. Contr. Apion. lib. ii.§. 4.</NOTE>. But I in∣tend
not to go so high as this. I take notice of this,
only because the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed under the <HI>Romans</HI> the
most extensive privileges out of <HI>Judea,</HI> which had
been granted by <HI>Alexander</HI> and his immediate succes∣sors;
<PB N="230" REF="248"/>
and because, the privileges, they received first
from them, seem to have been, in a great measure,
the models of those immunities which were granted by
the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>FOR <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that “<HI>Seleucus Nicalor</HI> gave them
[the <HI>Jews</HI>) the privileges of citizens in all the cities
which he built in <HI>Asia,</HI> and in lower <HI>Syria,</HI> and e∣ven
in <HI>Antioch</HI> the metropolis of his kingdome, and
made them equal to the <HI>Macedonians</HI> and <HI>Grecians;</HI>
which rights they still<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Joseph Ant. ubi supra. See <HI>Pridemix</HI> Conn. Part. I. Book viii. year before Chr. 293. p. 572.</NOTE> enjoy.”</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Flaccus,</HI> the Praetor of <HI>Asia</HI> was accu∣sed<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">About the year 60. before Christ.</NOTE> at <HI>Rome</HI> of several male-administrations in
that province, one of the charges brought against him
was, that he by an edict had forbid the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI>
to send any money out of that province to <HI>Jerusalem.
Cicero</HI> endeavours to defend <HI>Flaccus's</HI> conduct in this,
as well as other matters; but <HI>Cicero</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sequitur auri ilia invidia Judaici—Cum aurum Judaeo∣rum nomine, quotannis ex Italia, &amp; ex omnibus vestris provinciis Hierosolymam exportari foleret, Flaccus fanxit edicto, ne ex Asia exportari liceret. Pro Flacc. cap. 28.</NOTE> owns, that
the <HI>Jews</HI> did then send money to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> annually
from <HI>Italie,</HI> and from all the provinces subject to the
commonwealth. The bringing a charge against <HI>Flac∣cus</HI>
upon this head is a proof, that his edict was a no∣velty.
Nor does <HI>Cicero</HI> produce an instance of a like
restraint laid upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> before this, by the pre∣sident
of any province; which he certainly would have
done, if there had been any.</P>
<P>THERE were, after this, several decrees passed by
<HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> and the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> in favour of the
<HI>Jews</HI> who lived in <HI>Alexandria, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> which
were lodged in the Capitol at <HI>Rome,</HI> and copies of
them directed to the cities, in which the <HI>Jews</HI> dwelt;
requiring the magistrates of those cities to put them in
their publick acts, engraved upon two tables of brasse,
one in the <HI>Roman,</HI> another in the <HI>Greek</HI> language<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. Ant. lib. xiv. cap. 10. §. 2.</NOTE>.
<PB N="231" REF="249"/>
We have likewise in <HI>Josepbus</HI> copies of the decrees of
<HI>Delos, Laodicea, Pergamos, Sardis,</HI> and other cities,
in their proper forms; which were passed and registred
there in pursuance of the Decrees of the Roman Se∣nate:
“Declaring, that out of their piety to God, and
the concern they have always had for the support of
religion, and in imitation of the Roman People, who
are benefactors to all mankind, who had wrote to
them that the <HI>Jews</HI> should be permitted to perform
the sacred rites of their religion, observe their usual
Feasts and hold their assemblies; <HI>they</HI> ordain that
the <HI>Jews</HI> who think fit so to do, both men and wo∣men,
do keep the Sabbaths, and perform sacred
rites according to the <HI>jewish</HI> laws.—And if any man
whether magistrate or private person do give them,
any let or hindrance herein, he shall be fined, and
be reckoned debtor to the City<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 23.</NOTE>.” This is the sub∣stance
of the decree of the City of <HI>Hallicarnassus,</HI> which
the rest resemble.</P>
<P>BUT the rites of the <HI>Jews</HI> being extremely different
from those of all others, and the people of moll of the
Cities being superior in number to the <HI>Jews,</HI> they were
often giving them disturbance: And perhaps, the
<HI>Jews</HI> did sometimes give them offenses, which they
needed not to have done. It was then the businesse of
the Roman officers to do them justice, according to
the edicts of the Senate, and the Emperour.</P>
<P>AND we have some instances of their receiving
relief from the Higher Powers, when they had
been injured; and it is likely could not obtain sa∣tisfaction
from the ordinary officers, either through,
<PB N="232" REF="250"/>
their want of inclination, or of sufficient power and
authority to controle the dispositions of the people
where they resided.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the favourite of <HI>Augustus,</HI> was in
the <HI>East,</HI> witn extraordinary power, as he was passing
through <HI>Ionia,</HI> with HEROD THE GREAT<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">About the 13th or 14th year before the nativity of our Lord according to the common account.</NOTE> in his
company, the <HI>Jews</HI> made complaints to him, that
they were hindered in sending their tribute to the
temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that they were obliged to serve
in the army<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Jews</HI> had been excused from serving as soldiers, because they could not travel on the Sabbath, 1 or have provisions agreeable to their laws and customs. Vid. Joseph. Autiq. 14. cap. i0. §. 12.</NOTE> and had many other hardships put up∣on
them inconsistent with the privileges granted them
by the <HI>Romans</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. 16. c. 2. §. 3.</NOTE>. <HI>Agrippa</HI> gave them and their ad∣versaries
a solemn hearing, and in court confirmed to
them their ancient privileges, and gave orders “that
no one should molest them in the observation of
their peculiar rites and customs<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>SOME time after this<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Year before Christ 9.</NOTE>, the <HI>Jews,</HI> who lived in
<HI>Asia,</HI> and in <HI>Cyrene</HI> in <HI>Lybia,</HI> were oppressed and a∣bused
by the people in those countries; upon which,
the <HI>Jews</HI> sent an ambassy to <HI>Augustus</HI> himself for re∣dresse.
<HI>Jesephus</HI> has preserved a copy of the edict of
the Emperour upon. this occasion: wherein, having
first briefly mentioned the savours shewed to the <HI>Jews</HI>
by <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> and their fidelity to the Roman State,
“He ordains by his own authority, with the advice of
his council, that the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. l. 16. c. 6. §. 2. vid. &amp; Phi∣lon. de legat. ad Cai. p. 1035. E, 1026. A. B.</NOTE> <HI>Jews</HI> do practise their pe∣culiar
<PB N="233" REF="251"/>
rites according to the law of their country, that
their offerings be inviolable, that they be permitted
to send them to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and to deliver them to
those who are deputed to carry them to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
that they be not obliged to give appearance in any
court of Justice on the Sabbath, nor on the day be∣fore,
being the preparation, after the ninth hour,
And if any man be taken stealing their sacred books,
or their sacred money, out of the places of their
worship, or out of the chests in which they are kept,
he shall be deemed sacrilegious, and his goods shall
be confiscated to the publick treasury of the <HI>Ro∣mans.</HI>”</P>
<P>AND <HI>Philo</HI> assures us, that <HI>Augustus</HI> maintained,
throughout his reign, the indulgence given to the
<HI>Jews:</HI> “that there was in his time, a large quarter of the
city <HI>of Rome,</HI> on the other side of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> inhabited
by <HI>Jews;</HI> that <HI>Augusts</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. p. 1014. D.</NOTE> knew they had Oratories
there, and that they resorted to them, especially on
the Sabbaths, and that they also sent money instead
of first fruits, by their own officers, to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>”</P>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> they were generally well
used. They were indeed banished out of <HI>Italie</HI> by an
Edict: but it was for a misdemeanour committed by
some villains, of their nation at <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. 18. c. 4. §. 5.</NOTE>. The only
hardship of it was, that a great mainy innocent persons
suffered, beside the guilty. On other occasions, <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>
shewed them all the favour they could desire, espe∣cially
<PB N="234" REF="252"/>
after the death of <HI>Sejanus:</HI> and is much applaud∣ed
for it by <HI>Philo</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ubisupra p. 1015. B. C.</NOTE>. It was in the latter end of this
reign, that <HI>Vitellius,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> performed an
act of great complaisance to them. He was marching
with his forces against <HI>Aretas</HI> King of <HI>Petra</HI> in pursu∣ance
of orders he had received from <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and in∣tended
to pass through <HI>Judea.</HI> “But some of their
chief men waited upon him, and entreated him not
to lead his army through their country, because it
was contrary to their laws that any images should
be brought into it; whereas there were a great many
in his ensigns. And he hearkned to them, alter∣ed
his intention, and ordered his troops another
way<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 18. c. 6. §. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI> they met with
great hardships, especially at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> But the or∣ders,
which <HI>Caligula,</HI> had given for the erecting a sta∣tue
to himself, as a God, in the temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
and for punishing the <HI>Jews,</HI> if they opposed it, did
not take effect. By the kind and prudent manage∣ment
of <HI>Petronius,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> and the inter∣cessions
of <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Great, delays were obtained,
and <HI>Caligula</HI> died before the attempt was made.</P>
<P><HI>CLAUDIUS,</HI> the next succeeding Emperour
renewed to them all their privileges. He directed in
particular, by a decree, that the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI>
should be restored to all their rights which had been
injuriously taken away from them<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. l. 19. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>, in the reign of
<HI>Caligula.</HI> He likewise published another edict in fa∣vour
of the <HI>Jews</HI> living in other parts, in which he
<PB N="235" REF="253"/>
says: “We approve, that the <HI>Jews</HI> should in all
parts of the world subject to us, practise the rites of
their country without molestation, exhorting them
likewise<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ib. §. 3.</NOTE> to use this our humanity with moderation
and sobriety, and not to reproach the religions of
other nations, but to observe their own lawes. And
I will that all magistrates of cities and colonies and
municipal places, both within and without <HI>Italie,</HI>
and all Kings and Princes, have this my edict trans∣cribed
by their own officers, and that within thirty
dayes it be fixed in some public place, where it may
be conveniently read by all men.”</P>
<P>THERE was, in the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">A. D. 41, or 42.</NOTE>, a
remarkable piece of justice done the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Doris</HI> in
<HI>Syria,</HI> by <HI>Petronius,</HI> President of that province. The
sad is this: Some rash young fellows of the place got
in and set up a statue of the Emperour in the <HI>Jews</HI> Sy∣nagogue.
<HI>Agrippa</HI> the Great made complaints to <HI>Pe∣tronius</HI>
concerning this injury: Whereupon <HI>Petronius</HI>
issued a very sharp precept to the magistrates of <HI>Doris.</HI>
“He terms<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. 19. c. 6. §. 3.</NOTE> this action an offense, not against the
<PB N="236" REF="254"/>
<HI>Jews</HI> only, but also against the Emperour: <HI>says,</HI> it
is agreeable to the lawe of nature, that every man
should be master of his own places according to the
decree of the Emperour. I have, <HI>says he,</HI> given directi∣ons
that they, who have dared to do these things con∣trary
to the edict of <HI>Augustus,</HI> be delivered to the cen∣turion
<HI>Vitellius Proculus,</HI> that they may be brought
to me and answer for their behaviour. And I require
the chief men in the magistracy to discover the gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty
to the centurion, unless they are willing to have
it thought, that this injustice has been done with
their consent; and that they see to it, that no sediti∣on
or tumult happen upon this occasion; which, I
perceive, is what some are aiming at.—I do also
require, that for the future, you seek no pretense for
sedition or disturbance, but that all men worship
[<HI>God</HI>] according to their own customs.”</P>
<P>THE reader will, perhaps indulge a short interrup∣tion
here in the course of this narration, in favour of
an account, we have in the xvi. of the <HI>Acts of the Apo∣stles,</HI>
of a transaction, that in some respects resembles
this fact at <HI>Doris,</HI> and may receive consideraole light
from it.</P>
<P><HI>ST.</HI> Paul <HI>was at</HI> Philippi <HI>in</HI> Macedonia: (<HI>it was now
the 11th year of</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vid. Peirs: Ann. Paul. p. 11. A. ch. 51.</NOTE> Claudius.) <HI>He there cured</HI> a cer∣tain
Damsel, possessed with a Spirit of divination, which
brought her masters much gain by soothsaying, <HI>Acts xvi.</HI>
16-18. And when her masters saw that the hope of
their gains was gone, they caught <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> and,
drew them into the market place, unto the rulers—and
the multitude rose up together against them, and the magi∣strates
rent of their cloaths, and commanded to beat them.
And when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast
them into prison, charging the Jaylor to keep them safely.
ver. 19—23. And when it was day, the magistrates
sent the sargeants, saying, let those men go. And the kee∣per
of the prison told this saying to <HI>Paul.</HI>—But <HI>Paul</HI>
faid,—they have beaten us openly uncondemned being
<HI>Romans,</HI> and have cast us into prison, and now do they
<PB N="237" REF="255"/>
thrust us out privily? but let them come themselves and
fetch us out.—And when they heard that they were
<HI>Romans</HI>—they came, and besought them and brought
them out, and desired them to depart out of the City, <HI>ver.</HI>
35—39.</P>
<P>HERE we have an instance of a tumult raised by
some self-interested and designing men, the common
people incensed by their arguments, the magistrates
drawn into an act of injustice. <HI>Petronius</HI> seems to have
suspected, that the disorder at <HI>Doris</HI> had been commit∣ted
with the connivance of the rulers there. It is not
at all unlikely, that the magistrates of cities and towns,
who, possibly, were but a few degrees above the com∣mon
people, might sometimes approve of these out∣rages,
and act a part in them: but the Presidents and
Proconsuls, men of a larger Genius, who had been
educated at <HI>Rome,</HI> and served offices there, who were
better acquainted with the Roman Constitution, had a
greater charge, and were more immediately accounta∣ble
to the Emperour and the Senate for the observation
of their edicts and the peace of the province, never,
or very rarely, entered into these measures; but pu∣nished
such disorderly practises when they happened,
and by fresh precepts endeavoured to prevent them for
the future.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this act of the magistrates at <HI>Philippi</HI>
was a sudden thing (<HI>they have beaten us openly uncon∣demned</HI>). The order was given without a hearing;
and, as soon as it was light the next morning, they
sent their officers with directions, that the prisoners
should be released. They soon repented of what they
had done, and not withstanding the specious pretenses
and obnoxious charges of the masters of this damsel,
that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> had <HI>taught customs which were not
lawful for them to observe;</HI> they were sensible they had
gone beyond their commission, and were apprehensive
of being called to an account by a higher Authority,
to which they were subject. This order of release
was sent, before they had heard that these men were
<PB N="238" REF="256"/>
<HI>Romans,</HI> and whilst they knew no better than that
they were mere <HI>Jews,</HI> and defended by no other privi∣leges
than those that belonged to all of that nation.
And the history <HI>Josephus</HI> has given us of the fact at
<HI>Doris,</HI> and the conduct of the President of <HI>Syria,</HI> up∣on
occasion of it, may very well render every part of
this relation here highly probable. When these magi∣strates
knew that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were <HI>Romans,</HI> their
concern was still encreased; and their own interest
obliged them to all the farther condescensions, which
<HI>Paul</HI> demanded.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the course of the narration.</P>
<P>THERE was another signal instance of the modera∣tion
of <HI>Claudius</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> which may not be passed
by. But before I produce it, I must give some short
history of the vestment of the High Priest<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, which
I shall do in almost the very words of <HI>Josepbus;</HI> who
says, that <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, and his son <HI>Archelaus</HI> had
this sacred vestment in their keeping, and lodged it
in the castle <HI>Antonia;</HI> and that the Roman Procura∣tors,
who succeeded to them in the government of
<HI>Judea,</HI> finding it there, kept the possession of it, till
<HI>Vitellius,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> in the latter end of <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>'s
reign, gave it to the <HI>Jews</HI> to keep it themselves.
The High Priest wore this garment four times only in
the year; at the three great Feasts, and on the day of the
Fast. It was delivered to him seven days before these
seasons; and was first purified before he put it on. The
next day after these solemnities were over, it was re∣turned
to the officer of the Chest This was the me∣thod,
whilst it was kept by <HI>Herod</HI> and the Roman Go∣vernours.
But, as was just hinted above, <HI>Vitellius</HI> gave
it to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they might lock it up ill a Chest
of their own in the Temple, and take it out thence
for their use, without asking particular leave<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. 18. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT when <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI><NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">A. D. 45.</NOTE> was Procurator of
<HI>Judea,</HI> he received orders from the Emperour, to
<PB N="239" REF="257"/>
take <HI>the holy garment which the High-Priest alone wears
into his own possession. Josephus</HI> does, immediately be∣fore
this, mention a disturbance which the <HI>Jews</HI> of
<HI>Paraea</HI> gave to some of their neighbours. He does
not say, that this irregular proceeding had brought
upon them this disagreeable message: Though it is
highly probable, that it was owing to their irregular
conduct in that, or some other affair.</P>
<P>BUT however that be, when <HI>Fadus</HI> had received these
orders he called together “the High Priests<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 20. c. 1. §. 1.</NOTE> and
chief men of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> acquainted them with the
Emperour's orders, and commanded them to deliver
to him the Vestment of the High Priest, that it might
be lodged in the castle of <HI>Antonia,</HI> as formerly.
They did not dare absolutely to refuse: but they
earnestly entreated <HI>Fadus,</HI> and <HI>Cassius Longinus,</HI> Pre∣sident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> who was then likewise at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>”
(and who was indeed come thither with forces on pur∣pose
to prevent the sedition, which, it was apprehend∣ed,
the delivery and execution of this order might oc∣casion)
“that they would give them leave to send am∣bassadours
to the Emperour, and that they would
wait till fresh directions came from <HI>Rome;</HI> with which
request they complied.” When the <HI>jewish</HI> ambassa∣dors
came to <HI>Rome,</HI> they found there <HI>Agrippa</HI> the
younger, who seconded their petition. The Empe∣rour
granted their petition, and sent by them a letter
directed to the magistrates of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Senate,
People, and the whole nation of the <HI>Jews:</HI>” in which
he says, “<HI>Agrippa</HI>—having introduced to me your
ambassadours, who thankfully acknowledged the
benefits I have conferred upon your nation, and ear∣nestly
beseeched me, that you might have the sa∣cred
<PB N="240" REF="258"/>
Vestment and the Crown in your own keeping,
according as it had been allowed by the excellent
and my well beloved <HI>Vitellius,</HI> I have granted that
so it should be. I have ratified this sencence, from
that principle of piety with which I am possessed, and
because I will that all men worship [<HI>God</HI>] accord∣ing
to the laws of their country<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ib. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS argument will be imperfect, if I do not shew
some instance of this equity to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the reign
of <HI>Nero.</HI> The only fact I shall mention here, is this.
It happened in the time that <HI>Festus</HI> was Governour of
<HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">A. D. 60. Basnage Ann. P. E. A. 60. n. 3.</NOTE>, who was the person who sent <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Rome.
Agrippa</HI> the younger raised the buildings of the house,
in which he resided, when he was at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and
which had been the palace of the <HI>Asmonaean</HI> Family:
by which he had not only a fine prospect of the City,
but likewise overlooked the inner court of the temple.
“When the people of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> saw what he had
done, they were greatly incensed: for neither do
our customs nor our laws permit, that any beside
the priests should see what is done in the temple.
They therefore raised a high wall at the extremity
of the west side of the inner court of the temple<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>,
whereby they obstructed not only the king's view
[sc. <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s] out of his dining room, but also the
view from the western portico without the Court,
where the <HI>Romans</HI> used to keep gaurd on the festival
days. <HI>Agrippa</HI> was exceedingly provoked at it, and
<HI>Festus</HI> the Govenour yet more; and commanded
them to pull the wall down again. But they desired,
he would permit them to send ambassadours to <HI>Nero.
Festus</HI> giving them leave, they deputed to <HI>Nero</HI> ten
of their chief men, and <HI>Ishmael</HI> the High Priest, and
<HI>Helchias</HI> the Keeper of the sacred treasury. <HI>Nero</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="259"/>
having given them an audience, not only forgave
what they had done, but allowed that the building
should remain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 20. c. 8. §. 11.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS must be acknowledged to be a remarkable
instance of goodnesse. It shews a great backward∣nesse
in <HI>Nero,</HI> or those who then governed him, to
break in upon their religion, or anything they esteem∣ed
sacred. This Palace of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and the Roman
Fort, stood either directly west, or at lest very near
west of the Temple. The entrance into the Temple
was at the east end. So that they had no view from
these buildings into the Temple itself: only the high
ground they stood upon, and the loftinesse of the fa∣brick
gave a view into the inner court, where the sa∣crifices
were performed. And it being, as it seems, in∣consistent
with their law, or at lest with their customs,
that their sacred acts should be overlooked by any but
the Priests, the building that obstructed the view was
permitted by the Emperour to remain. I have alrea∣dy
taken notice of the permission the Roman Govern∣ment
had given the <HI>Jews,</HI> to kill any <HI>Gentile,</HI> though
a <HI>Roman,</HI> who entered beyond the bounds prescribed
to those who were not <HI>Jews,</HI> and need not repeat it
here.</P>
<P>§. V. I have now brought down my account of the
treatment, which the Roman Commonwealth and Em∣pire
gave to the several religions which obtained in
the countries under their dominion, and particularly
to the <HI>jewish</HI> religion, during the period I am con∣cerned with. There are, in this short view, several
acts of goodnesse and justice done to the <HI>Jews</HI> by Pre∣sidents
of provinces, beside the edicts and declarations
of the Senate, or the Emperours. But as the parti∣culars
relating to this subject, mentioned in <HI>the Acts of
the Apostles,</HI> are chiefly instances of the conduct of Go∣vernours
<PB N="242" REF="260"/>
of provinces, or of the officers next in autho∣rity
under them, it will not be amiss to add two or
three more testimonies relating to the behaviour of
persons of these characters.</P>
<P>“THERE happened likewise, <HI>says Josephus,</HI> ano∣ther
disturbance at <HI>Cesarea</HI><NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">A. D. 56. vid. Basnage Ann. Polit. Ecc.</NOTE>. The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Sy∣rians,</HI>
who lived there promiscuously, running both
into a seditious behaviour. For they would have it,
that the city was theirs, because the founder of it,
<HI>Herod</HI> their King was a <HI>Jew.</HI> These allowed that
the founder indeed was a <HI>Jew,</HI> but they asserted, that
notwithstanding that the city was the <HI>Greeks.</HI> For if
it had been given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> there would have
been no right of erecting statues and temples in it.
This point they disputed one with another, till they
came to blows; and the more resolute of each party
had daily skirmishes together. For the elders of the
<HI>Jews</HI> were not able to keep the seditious part of their
own people in order; and the <HI>Greeks</HI> were ashamed
to yield to the <HI>Jews.</HI> These had the advantage in
point of wealth and strength of body; but the <HI>Greeks</HI>
had the encouragement and assistance of the soldiers.
For the greatest part of the Roman garrison there
consisting of men raised in <HI>Syria,</HI> they were ready to
joyn with the <HI>Greeks</HI> as being their countrymen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Caeterum militum. praefectis curae erat tu∣multum coroprimere, &amp;c. Hudson. Vers.</NOTE>.
The officers however did their best to suppress these
disturbances, and from time to time seised the most
factious of each side, and punished them with scourg∣ing
or imprisonment. But yet the sufferings of those
who were apprehended did very little restrain or ter∣rifie
the rest, for they were rather the more provoked
to be seditious. At length the <HI>Jews</HI> having had the
better in a combat, <HI>Felix</HI> coming into the market
place, required them to withdraw peaceably, threat∣ning
<PB N="243" REF="261"/>
them severely if they did not. They not obey∣ing
him, he ordered his soldiers in amongst them:
many were killed upon the spot, whose goods<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
happened also to be plundered afterwards. The se∣dition
still continuing there, he having seleed seve∣ral
of the chief men of each body, sent them to <HI>Nero,</HI>
that they might both lay their several pretensions
before him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 13. sin.</NOTE>.&quot;</P>
<P>THIS is the account which <HI>Josephus</HI> gives of this af∣fair,
<HI>in the jewish war.</HI> In his <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> lib. 20. c. 6. §. 7.</NOTE>, a part
of this story stands thus: &quot;At length they came to
throwing of stones at each other. And many were
wounded on both sides. The <HI>Jews</HI> however had the
victory. <HI>Felix</HI> then, perceiving this contention be∣tween
them like to become a sort of open war, came
out to them, and desired the <HI>Jews</HI> to give over.
They not obeying him, he gave his soldiers orders
to take their arms, and fall upon them; and he slew
a great many, took more prisoners, and gave his
soldiers leave to plunder some houses which were full
of treasure. But the more moderate, and the most
eminent men of the <HI>Jews,</HI> being concerned for them∣seves,
as well as for their people, entreated <HI>Felix</HI> to
order his soldiers to retreat, and to spare the rest,
and also to forgive what had past. And <HI>Felix</HI> grant∣ed
their requests.&quot;</P>
<P>THESE passages of <HI>Josephus</HI> deserve the more to be
respected, because they assure us of the good measures
taken by <HI>Felix,</HI> a person not much celebrated for the
<PB N="244" REF="262"/>
justice of his administration in other matters, and by
the chief officers under him, where they had concerns
with men of different religions: and that they did not
attempt to subvert the rights of either side, but only
endeavoured to keep the peace among them, as far as
they were able, at a season, in which the <HI>Jews</HI> were
extremely resolute and tumultuous. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> re∣ceived
some civilities from <HI>Felix,</HI> as well as from <HI>Lysias,</HI>
one of his principal officers.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> gives an account of a sedition raised
by the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> about the time<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">An. D. 66.</NOTE> the war
broke out in <HI>Judea.</HI> Having mentioned the privileges
granted to the <HI>Jews</HI> there by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, he
says: &quot;And when the <HI>Romans</HI> became masters of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> neither <HI>Cesar</HI> the first (of that name) nor any
of his successors would suffer the honours conferred
upon them [<HI>the Jews</HI>] by <HI>Alexander</HI> to be diminished.
There were however continual contentions between
them and the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> THOUGH THE PRE∣SIDENTS
DAILY PUNISHED MANY ON BOTH SIDES,
yet animosities encreased. And as there were dis∣turbances
at that time in other places, so especially
at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The <HI>Alexandrians</HI> having called an
assembly to consider of the ambassy they were about
to send to <HI>Nero,</HI> a great many of the <HI>Jews</HI> came into
the amphitheatre and mixed themselves with the
<HI>Greeks.</HI> When some of the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> perceived
them, they cried out, that there were enemies come
in amongst them to be spies upon their debates;
and immediately laid hands upon several of them;
some others perished, as they were getting out: and
three in particular, which had gotten out, were ta∣ken
and brought back. These they threatned to
burn alive. Hereupon all the <HI>Jews</HI> in general
came to the rescue of these men. They began with
throwing stones at the <HI>Greeks:</HI> Then getting lighted
<PB N="245" REF="263"/>
torches they surrounded the Amphitheatre, and
threatned to set fire to it, and burn all the people
there to a man. So they would have done, if <HI>Tiberius
Alexander</HI> prefect of the city had not prevented them.
Though indeed he did not begin immediately with
hostilities. But sending some persons of distinction
to them, advised them to be peaceable, and not to
draw upon themselves the Roman garrison. But
these seditious people ridiculed the advice, and re∣viled <HI>Tiberius.</HI>”</P>
<P>THE President happened to have with him five
thousand soldiers, who had halted <HI>at Alexandria,</HI> in
their march from <HI>Libya</HI> into <HI>Judea,</HI> beside the two Le∣gions
the usual garrison there.</P>
<P><HI>TIBERIUS</HI> therefore ordered his soldiers to their
arms. The <HI>Jews</HI> made a long defense, but when once
they were routed, there was a dreadful slaughter of
them: “Fifty thousand were killed. Nor would any
of them have been left alive, if they had not submit∣ted
and cried out for mercy. <HI>Alexander</HI> then taking
compassion on them, ordered his soldiers to desist.
They being always trained to obedience, gave over
the slaughter at the very first word of command.
But the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> being filled with inveterate ha∣tred
were difficultly drawn off, and could scarce be
restrained from insulting and abusing the dead bo∣dies<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 18. §. 7, 8.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a long story. But the passage con∣taining
not only a character of the usual conduct of
the Presidents of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but giving us likewise an in∣stance
of a very great moderation, I was unwilling to
abridge it very much. I term it moderation: for so
it seems to me, for the Governour to send amicable
advice to so tumultuous a body of people, and warn
them of the consequences of obstinacy, instead of com∣ing
upon them with his forces, especially when he
was so well provided. And it was very honourable,
to accept the first tenders of submission.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="264"/>
I shall give but one passage more relating to this
matter. “They [<HI>the Jews</HI>] received likewise, <HI>says
Josephus,</HI> considerable honours from the Kings of
<HI>Asia,</HI> because they had served them in their wars. <HI>Se∣leucus
Nicator</HI> gave them the privileges of citizens in
<HI>Antioch</HI> the Metropolis of his kingdome, which pri∣vilege
they enjoy to this day. I need give no other
proof of it than this, that the <HI>Jews</HI> refusing to use
oyle prepared by other people, the <HI>Gymnasiarchs</HI><NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Officers that governed the places of exercise in the <HI>Greek</HI> cities.</NOTE>
give them a certain prescribed piece of money instead
of the oyle which should be allowed them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> And
when the people of <HI>Antioch,</HI> in the time of the late
war would have broke in upon this custom, <HI>Mucianus,</HI>
then president of <HI>Syria</HI> obliged them to continue it,
And afterwards, when <HI>Vespasian</HI> and his son <HI>Titus</HI>
were become Lords of the whole world, and the <HI>A∣lexandrians</HI>
and <HI>Antiochians</HI> desired that the rights of
citizenship might be taken from the <HI>Jews,</HI> they would
not comply with their desire. From whence any may
perceive the equity and true greatnesse<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and especially of <HI>Vespasian</HI> and <HI>Titus;</HI> who
though they had undergone many fatigues in the
war with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and had been very much offend∣ed
with them, that they would not submit themselves
to them, but fought against them to the last as long
as they were able, yet they did not take away from
them the forementioned citizenship: But so mode∣rated
and resisted their own former displeasure a∣gainst
the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the entreaties of the <HI>Alexan∣drians</HI>
and <HI>Antiochians,</HI> people of the greatest conse∣quence,
as not to abrogate any part of the ancient
privileges given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> out of favour for those
cities, or out of resentment toward those wicked
people whom they had vanquished; saying, That
they who had taken up arms against them, and had
<PB N="247" REF="265"/>
been subdued by them, had been sufficiently punish∣ed,
and that it would be unjust to deprive those of
their privileges who had committed no fault<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. lib. xii. cap. 3. init.</NOTE>.”
Here is one remarkable instance of <HI>jewish</HI> nicenesse,
and more than one example of the Roman generosity.</P>
<P>THESE are authentick testimonies in behalf of the
equity of the Roman government in general, and of
the impartial administration of Justice by the Roman
Presidents toward all the people of their provinces,
how much soever they differed from each other in mat∣ters
of religion.</P>
<P>IT is undoubted, that many of these Presidents
were guilty of extortion, and other acts of injustice,
and endeavoured to enrich themselves in the provinces.
But there seems not to have been any one thing, which
the <HI>Romans</HI> were more concerned to preserve inviola∣ble,
than the religion of all the people whom they con∣quered;
judging, it is likely, that there is nothing
gives a people so universal a disgust, as injuries done
to their religion; and that therefore, the only way to
preserve peace throughout their empire, was to pro∣tect
all men every where in the practise of their own
religious rites<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quid hem! mediocrine tandem dolore cosaffectos esse arbitra∣mini? non ita est, judices: primum quod omnes religione moventur:&amp; deos patrios quos a majoribus acceperunt, colendos sibi diligenter &amp; retinendos csse arbitrantur. Cic. in Verr. lib. iv. c. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§. VI. I imagine however, that the reader will be
apt to recollect here the several violations of things sa∣cred,
which I have related to have been committed by
<HI>Verres</HI> in <HI>Sicilie;</HI> and he may be inclined to think that
such instances do very much weaken this argument.</P>
<P>BUT then, it ought to be remember'd likewise, that
these actions were very much cried out upon, and <HI>Ver∣res</HI>
was called to an account for them. Besides, there
is no reason to believe there were many <HI>Verres.</HI> It
ought also to be considered, that <HI>Verres</HI> was Praetor of
<HI>Sicilie</HI> under the commonwealth, at a time when the
<PB N="248" REF="266"/>
courts of judicature at <HI>Rome,</HI> before whom complaints
from the provinces were brought, were extremely cor∣rupt;
when justice was administer'd very slowly, and
oftentimes not obtained at all. There are in <HI>Cicero</HI>
himself many acknowledgements of the bad state of
affairs at that time in this respect<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spoliasti Siculos. Solent enim <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nulti esse in injuriis suis pro∣vinciales. Cic. in Verr. lib. iii. c. 41. Lugent omnes provinciae: queruntur omnes liberi populi: regna denique jam omnia de nostris cupiditatibus &amp; injuriis expostulant. ibid. cap. 89.</NOTE>. And I believe,
the provinces were much happier under the Empe∣rours
for a considerable time below the period of the
evangelical history, than they had been for some time
under the commonwealth.</P>
<P>THERE was a very signal piece of justice done the
<HI>Jews</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Claudius.</HI> It lies so much in the
very midst of our history, that it is not easie to pass it
by. In the time that <HI>Cumanus,</HI> predecessor to <HI>Felix,</HI>
was Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> there happened a difference
between the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans;</HI> the rise of which
was an assault made by the <HI>Samaritans</HI> upon some <HI>Ga∣lileans</HI>
as they were going up to <HI>Jerusalem. Cumanus</HI>
not doing his duty, complaints were made to <HI>Ummidi∣as
Quadratus,</HI> president of <HI>Syria.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> affirmed,
that <HI>Cumanus</HI> had been bribed by the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> and
each side made many complaints. <HI>Quadratus</HI> came in∣to <HI>Judea,</HI> punished some himself, sent several of the
chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans,</HI> as well as <HI>Cumanus,</HI>
and <HI>Celer</HI> the <HI>Tribune,</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> to give an account of
themselves to <HI>Claudius:</HI> who having heard both sides,
pronounced sentence, banished<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 20. c. 5. §. 3. vid. &amp; de B. P. 1074. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Cumanus,</HI> and or∣dered
that <HI>Celer</HI> the <HI>Tribune</HI> should be had back to <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
and, after he had been led through the city,
be beheaded.</P>
<P>I cannot be certain that <HI>Celer</HI> had the same post at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> under <HI>Cumanus,</HI> that <HI>Lysias</HI> had under <HI>Felix;</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="267"/>
though <HI>Josepbus</HI> gives <HI>Celer</HI> the same title that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
does <HI>Lysias.</HI> Nor would I be understood to insinuate
that this punishment of <HI>Celer</HI> was the chief cause of
<HI>Lysias's</HI> good conduct. He appears to me so just,
punctual, and prudent in every part of his behaviour,
during that short time that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
after he was taken into custody, that I take it for
granted he was acted by some better principle. But
though this savourable supposition be a piece of justice
to <HI>Lysias,</HI> yet I make no doubt, but that this execu∣tion
of <HI>Celer</HI> was a restraint upon some people; and
that St. <HI>Paul</HI> and many others in <HI>Judea,</HI> and possibly
in other provinces likewise, had some benefit by it.</P>
<P>I have, I hope, in this chapter, and other parts of
this work, given passages enough to enable every rea∣der
to judge for himself in this point; and whereby he
may be assured, the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed their religion in <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
and out of it, without any very considerable mo∣lstations.
They had particularly, in <HI>Judea,</HI> their
High Priests, frequented <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at their great seafts:
Images and other abominations were kept out of the
country, or, if they were brought in, they were soon
carried back again.</P>
<P>NAY there appear, in the accounts I have given,
several positive proofs of an equal administration of
justice in divers parts, where injuries were offered;
and more might be given. A Roman soldier in <HI>Judea</HI>
having rent and burnt a book of the lawes of <HI>Moses,</HI>
the forementioned <HI>Cumanus,</HI> at the request of the <HI>jews,</HI>
had him put<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 20. cap. 4. §. 4. de B. J. 2. c. 12. §. 2.</NOTE> to death. I believe, that most will
allow, a capital punishment of a crime not particular∣ly
specified, it is likely, in any law whatsoever, to be
an act of compleat justice at lest.</P>
<P>§. VII. IT will be needful however, in order fully
to clear up this matter, to subjoin two or three re∣marks.</P>
<P>1. IT must be owned, that according to the Roman
laws, no man might introduce any new Gods, or wor∣ship
<PB N="250" REF="268"/>
publickly or privately any strange or foreign
Gods, not allowed of by publick authority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Separatim nemo habessit deos neve novos: Sed ne advenas, nisi publicè adscitos, privatim colunto. Cic. de legib. lib. ii. c. 8. init.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. BUT yet the disciples of Jesus Christ were under
the protection of the Roman laws, since the God whom
they worshiped, and whose worship they recommend∣ed,
was the God of the heavens and the earrh, the
same God whom the <HI>Jews</HI> worshiped, and the worship
of whom was allowed of all over the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI>
and established by special edicts and decrees in most,
perhaps in all the places, in which we meet with St.
<HI>Paul</HI> in his travels.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes his defenfe be∣fore
<HI>Felix</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> upon this foot. <HI>They neither found
me in the temple disputing with any man—</HI> But this I
confess to thee, that after the way which they call heresie,
so <HI>inorship</HI> I THE GOD OF MY FATHERS, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiv. 14.
They call this way a sect; a new sect; grant it to be
so: But in this way I worship the God of my fa∣thers,
the same God which they do, and believe all
things which are written in the law and the prophets,
as firmly as any <HI>Jew</HI> whatever: Nor do I say any
thing inconstent with them, or which I cannot support
by them: and therefore I am entitled to protection
equally with them, since I have not attempted nor ad∣vised
any disturbance or insurrection. This therefore
was a very just and proper defense before <HI>Felix,</HI> a hea∣then
magistrate; and it was compleatly valid.</P>
<P>AND the Roman magistrates out of <HI>Judea,</HI> and the
heathen people every where considered St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his
companions as <HI>Jews.</HI> It was so evidently in <HI>Achaia.</HI>
The <HI>Jews</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI> before the judgement Seat, <HI>say∣ing,
this fellow perswadeth men to worship God contray to
the Law,</HI> Acts xviii. 1. But <HI>Gallio</HI> supposed that
<HI>Paul</HI> had as good a right to protection as themselves,
and that the differences between <HI>Paul</HI> and them were
no other than such as might happen between men of
one and the same religion: and that the only reason,
<PB N="251" REF="269"/>
why <HI>Paul</HI> was brought before him was the envy, ma∣lice,
and bigotry of some of the leading men among
the <HI>Jews</HI> of his province. <HI>If it be a question of words
and names,</HI> says he, AND OF YOUR LAW, <HI>look ye to it,
for I will be no judge of such matters,</HI> ver. 15.</P>
<P>FROM whence, I think it appears, that <HI>Gallio</HI> was
not so ignorant of the case brought before him, as some
may be ready to imagine. If, <HI>says be,</HI> the matter in
dispute<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> be a <HI>word,</HI> some particular opinion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. p. 793. 20. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. 23.</NOTE> and
doctrine, which, you say, <HI>Paul</HI> preaches; or of names,
whether Jesus may be called the Christ; (or perhaps
he means, of matters, about which the difference is
so small that it is rather a controversie about names
than things): or of <HI>your law,</HI> whether it obliges all
men to be circumcised, who go over to the worship of
your God, I will be no judge between you concerning
such matters.</P>
<P>IF the sense, I here give of these words, and parti∣cularly
of <HI>your law,</HI> be right, it is an evidence, that
<HI>Gallio</HI> knew very well, that <HI>Paul</HI> had converted <HI>Hea∣thens</HI>
to his sentiments; and yet he took no offense at
it: Only he was resolved not to passe any judicial sen∣tence
upon these matters. And inded, I think it plain
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account, that <HI>Gallio</HI> had heard the
<HI>Jews</HI> tell their story out. But, when they had done,
he had more honour and good sense, than to oblige
<HI>Paul</HI> to make any apology for his principles in court,
under the character of a criminal or accused person.</P>
<P>NOR is it at all strange, that <HI>Gallio</HI> did not resent
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s converting men from Heathenism to the
worship of the true God; since the <HI>Jews</HI> had done the
same thing in many parts of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> with∣out
offense, though not with so good successe, as St.
<HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed. It is apparent, that the Heathen
<HI>people</HI> also considered the Apostle and those with him,
as <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="270"/>
IT is with this speech, that the masters of the dam∣sel
at <HI>Philippi</HI> come before the magistrates, when they
brought along with them <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas: These men</HI>
BEING JEWS <HI>do exceedingly trouble our City,</HI> Acts xvi.
30. And tho' the magistrates were so far heated and
misled by these men, as to order <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> to be
beaten and imprisoned; yet they had no sooner reflect∣ed
upon what they had done, but they were sen∣sible,
that they themselves had broken the laws, in
punishing men that were <HI>Jews</HI> for spreading their prin∣ciples,
and that they were liable to be reprimanded
for it.</P>
<P>THE uproar at <HI>Ephesus</HI> affords a remarkable proof
of the same thing. The Silversmiths that made shrines
for <HI>Diana</HI> began a popular speech there: <HI>Ye see,</HI> say
they, <HI>and hear, that not alone at</HI> Ephesus, <HI>but almost
throughout all</HI> Asia, <HI>this</HI> Paul <HI>hath perswaded and turned
away much people, saying,</HI> THAT THEY BE NO GODS
WHICH ARE MADE WITH HANDS. (All the <HI>Jews</HI> said
the same thing.) <HI>And the whole city was filled with</HI> con∣fusion.
—<HI>And they rushed with one accord into the thea∣tre.—And
they drew</HI> Alexander <HI>out of the multitude,</HI>
THE JEWS PUTTING HIM FORWARD. <HI>And</HI> Alexan∣der
<HI>beckned with the hand, and would have made his
defence unto the people. But when they knew that he was
a</HI> JEW, <HI>all with one voice about the space of two hours
cried out, Great is</HI> Diana <HI>of the</HI> Ephesians, <HI>Acts</HI> xix.
26—34.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER <HI>was put forward by the</HI> Jews, and
undoubtedly intended to have declaimed against <HI>Paul;</HI>
but so soon as the <HI>people knew that he was a</HI> Jew, in∣stead
of hearkning to him, they were thrown into a
fresh ferment.</P>
<P>I think, I need not add that <HI>Fesius</HI> so understood
the matter likewise, his words having been already
more than once produced, in which he tells <HI>Agrippa,</HI>
that when <HI>Paul's</HI> accusers stood up, they had only <HI>certain
questions against him of</HI> THEIR OWN SUPERSTITION.
<HI>Ch.</HI> xxv. 18, 19.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="271"/>
3. IT ought to be observed, that the first followers
of Jesus did every where observe an admirable deco∣rum
in all their words and actions. It may, perhaps,
be inconceiveable by some, how they should be able
thus to behave every where, animated, as they were,
with a warm, as well as just zeal for the truths of the
Christian doctrine, and a thorough dislike of all the
abominations and absurdities of the heathen worship.
But yet it is certain they did so. We have uncontested
evidence of it.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> assures us, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. that when St.
<HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when.
he saw the city was wholly given to idolatry.</HI> But when
he comes to make his speech in the <HI>Areopagus,</HI> his
temper and addresse are equal to his argument, which
certainly can never be exceeded. According to our
translation indeed, there is harshnesse in the very in∣troduction:
<HI>Ye men of</HI> Athens, <HI>I perceive that in all
things you are too superstitious.</HI> But all must allow, that
the original<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Si lenitatem Pauli spectemus—confirmat hoc imprimis 2 <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> traducta vox: cui quidem inest multâ suavitate per∣mista castigatio. Sam. Drake S. T. P. de arâ Ignoto Deo Sacrâ. Cantab. 1724. p. 12.</NOTE> is peculiarly soft, if any censure was
intended: But<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is often used in a bad sense, but it has also a good, or at lest, an innocent meaning. <HI>Festus</HI> tells <HI>Agrippa,</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI>'s accu∣sers had nothing against him <HI>but certain questions</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>of their own superstition,</HI> Acts xxv. 19. It should be rendered <HI>religion.</HI> It cannot be supposed, that <HI>Festus</HI> would speak contemptuously to <HI>Agrippa</HI> of the <HI>jewish,</HI> that is, of <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s own religion; when <HI>Agrippa</HI> was come to <HI>Cesarea</HI> with his sister <HI>Bernice</HI> to <HI>salute</HI> him. It is also apparent that <HI>Festus</HI> does shew <HI>Agrippa</HI> a great deal of respect. <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Manasses</HI> having repented of his idolatry, and other sins against God, he resolved for the fu∣ture, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to be constant in the worship of him. [<HI>Joseph.</HI> p. 437. 20.] <HI>Claudius,</HI> in his edict pub∣lished in favour of the <HI>Jews,</HI> exhorts them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> [id. p. 866. 18.] not to set at nought, or to revile the religions of other nations, [vid. eund. p. 632. 39. p. 1066. 31.] It appears also from what follows, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> had not blamed the <HI>Athenians.</HI> Having mentioned the inscription of the altar, <HI>To the unknown God;</HI> he goes on, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</HI> The verb here used for worship is always expressive of a laudable piety. (See examples in <HI>Grotius</HI> upon the place.) The harsh sense of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is inconsistent with the whole design of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s argument. If he had told them at first that they were super∣stitious, he encourages them in it, and endeavours to make them more so. If St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s instance had been that of some false God, there had been some reason to put the harsh sense upon the word in this place. But now there is no reason at all for it; since the inscription he produces directly intended, or at lest comprehended under it, the true God, whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached. I think therefore, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> says: <HI>I perceive, that ye are in all things very devout. For as I passed along, and observed the Objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription:</HI> To THE UNKNOWN GOD. <HI>Whom therefore ye worship without knowing him, him do I declare unto you.</HI></NOTE> I apprehend that St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells them,
<PB N="254" REF="272"/>
He perceived they were <HI>in all things very denout.</HI> This
would give no offense at <HI>Athens.</HI> It was their peculi∣ar

It was customary for eminent strangers, who spoke in publick at <HI>Athens,</HI> to give them in their first discourse some commendation, taken from the wisdom of their lawes and institutions, or some other topic. St. <HI>Paul</HI> had good reason not to be defective in this point up on so nico an occasion. He could very truly say, they were a devout people. It was extremely to his purpose, and they would be much pleased to hear it from him. 'H <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philost. vit. Alexand. Sophist. §. 3. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. vit. Polem. § 4. It was therefore a singu∣larity in <HI>Polemon,</HI> a most proud man, that in his discourse at <HI>Athens,</HI> at his first visit, he said nothing in their praise.

Adrian. §. 2. <HI>Grotius</HI> understood St. <HI>Paul</HI> to speak here of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the way of commendation, as I do.</NOTE> character; the encomium which they were
fond of above any other.</P>
<P>IT is true, St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, that at the conclusion,
<HI>When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of
<PB N="255" REF="273"/>
this matter,</HI> ver. 32. It is very possible, some might be
surprised at the novelty of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s principles, and be
inclined to make themselves merry with them. But I
do not perceive by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that there were; I think,
there could not be any exceptions made to the propri∣ety,
or decence of any of his expressions.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not recorded any of the discourses made
by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or those who were with him, at <HI>Ephesus.</HI>
But however, we have authentic evidence of the inno∣cence
of their words and actions there also. <HI>Ye have
brought hither,</HI> says the town-clerk to the people of
<HI>Ephesus, these men, which are neither robbers of churches,
nor yet blasphemers of your goddesse,</HI> Acts xix. 37. He says
this of <HI>Gaius</HI> and <HI>Aristarchus,</HI> men of <HI>Macedonia, Paul</HI>'s
companions in travels. So that this temper and pru∣dence
were not peculiar to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but common to
him with his companions. What the town-clerk says
here may be relied on: he is speaking to the enraged
multitude: If there had been any <HI>blasphemies</HI> uttered
by <HI>these men,</HI> he had made them his own.</P>
<P>THE conduct, or expresse declarations of <HI>Felix,
Festus, Agrippa,</HI> are testimonies to the like unblameable
and inoffensive behaviour of St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>I do not say, that according to laws since enacted in
some States, the Apostles would not have been judged
offenders. But it ought to be remember'd that the
<HI>Romans</HI> did for a long time as far surpass many mo∣dern
governments in the justice and equity of their po∣litical
maxims, as in the grandeur of their empire:
nor had they yet renounced or departed from them.</P>
<P>HAD there been any affront offered by <HI>Paul</HI> to the
<HI>jewish</HI> religion, either <HI>Felix</HI> or <HI>Festus</HI> would have disco∣vered
and punished it. When such things were done
by <HI>Romans,</HI> they could not escape. Undoubtedly
therefore <HI>Paul</HI> had been as innocent in <HI>Judea,</HI> as he
had been out of it.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, from the several particulars
here alledged, it must appear highly probable, that
the chief officers of such a government, as the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="274"/>
was at the rise of the Christian religion, should treat
the first preachers of it, just as they are represented by
St. <HI>Luke</HI> to have done.</P>
<P>THEY had no authority, by virtue of any edicts or
decrees then passed, to enter into the controversies
then on foot between several cities in <HI>Egypt,</HI> who wor∣shiped
some one animal, and some another, but none
of them the Gods of the <HI>Romans.</HI> These governourshad
not been wont to interpose between any of the sects
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> of which there had been several for a long
time, when no tumult or sedition arose among them.
The <HI>Jews,</HI> it is likely, would have thought it the high∣est
injustice, and would have made the loudest com∣plaints,
if they had. The first Christians did not dif∣fer
more from the <HI>Pharisees</HI> or <HI>Essenes,</HI> I do not say
from the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> than these three Sects differed one
from another. How can it be thought then that these
governours should undertake to suppresse the first<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">When the <HI>Romans</HI> permitted the <HI>Jewish</HI> synagogues to use their own laws, and proper government; Why, I pray, should there not be the same toleration allowed to the Apostolical Churches? The <HI>Roman</HI> Censure had as yet made no difference between the judaizing synagogues of the <HI>Jews</HI> and the Christian synagogues or churches of the <HI>Jews:</HI> nor did it permit them to live after their own laws, and forbid these. <HI>Dr.</HI> Lightfoot. <HI>Hebr. and Talmud. Exerc. on Matth.</HI> iv. 23.</NOTE>
Christians, when they were obliged to protect all the
rest; not this or that sect, but all die <HI>Jews</HI> in general?</P>
<P>THE Roman government protected the many rites
of all their provinces. They protected <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Hea∣thens</HI>
in one and the same city. The <HI>Jews</HI> had been
now for some while, from time to time, making pro∣selytes
of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Syrians;</HI> converted them to the
worship of the true God, the God whom the Christi∣ans
preached; and brought them, some indeed to part
only, others, to the observation of all the peculiar
rites of their religion. This they had done, and the
Presidents gave them no interruption or molestation.
Must not then these officers have esteemed it, as St.
<HI>Luke</HI> represents them to have done, a new species of
envy and malice in the <HI>Jews</HI> to bring before them, and
<PB N="257" REF="275"/>
desire justice against <HI>Paul</HI> and his companions, barely
because they did not submit to them in every particu∣lar?
And must not these officers have been prepared
likewise to controle their own people, when they
would have abused <HI>Paul</HI> for what the <HI>Jews</HI> had been
permitted to do, that is, for converting men to his pe∣culiar
sentiments, when his principles were not at all
more disagreeable to them, than those of the <HI>Jews;</HI>
and his behaviour was far more peaceable and inoffen∣sive
than theirs had been?</P>
<P>§ VIII. THERE is however one difficulty, which,
I am aware, may be started by some persons. If the
Roman government, to which all the world was then
subject, was so mild and gentle, and protected all men
in the profession of their several religious tenets, and
the practise of all their peculiar rites; whence comes
it to pass that there are in the epistles so many exhor∣tations
to the Christians to patience and constancy; and
so many arguments of consolation suggested to them as
a suffering body of men? Does not the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>
tell the <HI>Philippians,</HI> that <HI>to them it was given in the be∣half
of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suf∣fer
for his sake,</HI> Phil. i. 29. And the <HI>Thessalonians, that
they had suffered like things of their own countrymen; even
as they</HI> (the churches of <HI>Judea</HI>) <HI>have of the Jews?</HI>
1 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii. 14. Is not <HI>Timothie</HI> directed to <HI>endure hard∣ness
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ?</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 3. Are
not the <HI>Hebrews</HI> reminded that they had <HI>endured a great
fight of affliction?</HI> Heb. x. 32. Does not St. <HI>Peter</HI> inti∣mate,
that they, whom he wrote to, had <HI>been in heavi∣ness
through manifold temptations?</HI> 1 Pet. i. 6.</P>
<P>To this I answer.</P>
<P>1. THAT the account St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given, <HI>in the
Acts of the Apostles,</HI> of the behaviour of the Roman of∣ficers
out of <HI>Judea,</HI> and in it, is confirmed not only by
the account I have given of the genius and nature of
the Roman government, but also by the testimonies of
the most ancient Christian writers. The <HI>Romans</HI> did af∣terwards
depart from these moderate maxims; but it
<PB N="258" REF="276"/>
is certain, that they were governed by them as long as
the history of the Acts of the Apostles reaches. <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI>
and divers others do affirm, that <HI>Nero</HI> was the
first Emperour that persecuted the Christians<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Consulite commentarios vestros: illic reperictis primum Ne∣ronem in hanc Sectam. cum maximè Romae orientem, caefariano gladio ferocisse. Tertul. Apol. cap. 5. Primus omnium persecutus Dei servos. Lactantius de Mortib. persecut. c. 2. Hic primus Christianorum nomen tollere aggressus est. Sulpic. Sev. Hist. l. ii. c. 40.</NOTE>; nor
did he begin to disturb them till after <HI>Paul</HI> had left
<HI>Rome</HI> die first time he was there (when he was sent thi∣ther
by <HI>Festus</HI>) and therefore not till he was become an
enemy to all mankind. And I think, that according
to the account which <HI>Tacitus</HI> has given of <HI>Nero</HI>'s inhu∣mane
treatment of the Christians at <HI>Rome</HI> in the tenth
year of his reign, what he did then was not owing to
their having different principles in religion from the <HI>Ro∣mans;</HI>
but proceeded from a desire he had to throw off
from himself the odium of a vile action, namely setting
fire to the City, which he was generally charged<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ergo abolendo rumori Nero subdidit reos.—Tacit. Ann. xv. c. 44.</NOTE>
with. And <HI>Sulpicius Severus,</HI> a Christian historian of
the fourth century, says the same thing<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Neque ulla re Nero efficiebat, quin ab eo jussum incendium putaretur. Igitur vertit invidiam in Chrstianos, actae∣que in innoxios crudelissimae quaestiones. Sulpic. ibid. c. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>2dly, I answer, that if the reader will be at the
pains of comparing the <HI>Epistles</HI> of the <HI>New Testament</HI>
with the history of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> he will find
a perfect harmony in all those particulars which are
mentioned in both.</P>
<P><HI>THUS St.</HI> Paul <HI>writes to the</HI> Thessalonians: Ye be∣came
followers of the churches which in <HI>Judea</HI> are in
Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your
own countrymen, even as they have of the <HI>Jews,</HI> I Thess.
ii. 14. <HI>And St.</HI> Luke <HI>informs us, that at</HI> Thessaloni∣ca,
the <HI>Jews</HI> which believed not, moved with envy, took
unto than certain lewd fellows of the baser sort- and ga∣thered
a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and
assaulted the house of <HI>Jason</HI>—Acts xvii. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="277"/>
As according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> they were the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
usually began, or aggravated the disturbances against
<HI>Paul;</HI> so <HI>Paul</HI> himself ascribes his own sufferings, and
those of others likewise, to the <HI>Jews.</HI> Thus it follows
in the place just now cited from him: <HI>who both killed
the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have per persecu∣ted
us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all
men: forbidding us to speak unto the</HI> Gentiles <HI>that they
may be saved,</HI> 1 Thess. ii. 15, 16. And to the <HI>Galatians</HI>
he says, <HI>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision,
why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offence of the
Cross ceased,</HI> Gal. iv. II, From which words it is plain,
that all the Apostle's sufferings came from the bigot∣ted
<HI>Jews;</HI> and that, if it had not been for them, he
might have preached the gospel quietly enough.</P>
<P>THOUGH the <HI>Romans</HI> were masters of the world,
and were governed by these moderate maxims, as I
have shewn; yet the first Christians might be exposed
to many hardships and sufferings, as they certainly
were. The sources of them are very evident. There
was a heavy perfecution in <HI>Judea,</HI> which commenced
not long after our Saviour's ascension, and lasted, pro∣bably,
several Years. The <HI>Jews</HI> had a right to call
men before the council, could excommunicate men
out of their synagogues, scourge, and beat them; they
could bring men before the Governour and prosecute
for capital crimes. Doubtless they exerted all the pow∣er
they had against the believers, and did other things
they had no right to do, partly through connivance,
it is likely, of the Governour, and partly, perhaps,
because he could not hinder them. Then <HI>Herod Agrip∣pa</HI>
was King of <HI>Judea</HI> three years and more, and he,
out of his own aversion to Christianity, and to please
the <HI>Jews,</HI> was an inveterate enemy of the followers of
Jesus. And after this, when <HI>Judea</HI> was again put un∣der
Roman Procurators, beside the lesser punishments
the <HI>Jews</HI> could inflict themselves, they could prosecute
before the Procurators, as they did <HI>Paul.</HI> And we
find, that though <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus</HI> were both convinced
<PB N="260" REF="278"/>
of his innocence; yet they did, neither of them, dare
to release him against the inclinations of the people of
their province. And such was the <HI>jewish</HI> influence in
this cause, that by their means <HI>Paul</HI> was kept two
years in prison in <HI>Judea,</HI> and as many afterwards at
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Sufferings which the Christians were lia∣ble
to out of <HI>Judea;</HI> every one must be sensible, that
where-ever <HI>Paul,</HI> or any other made any considerable
number of converts among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> many of the
common people were provoked, and would be apt to
insult them; and, in some places, the inferior magi∣strates
might be so weak as to concur with them, <HI>Acts</HI>
xvi. 22. Besides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were numerous every
where, throughout the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> When <HI>Paul</HI>
was at <HI>Lystra, there came thither certain</HI> Jews <HI>from</HI> An∣tioch
<HI>and</HI> Iconium, <HI>who perswaded the people; and ha∣ving
stoned</HI> Paul, <HI>drew him out of the City: supposing he
had been dead,</HI> Ch. xiv. 19. How <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>of</HI> Thessa∣lonica,
[<HI>Ch.</HI> xvii. 5.] behaved, we have seen just now.
These very same <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Thessalonica</HI> followed <HI>Paul</HI>
and <HI>Silas</HI> to <HI>Beraea, and stirred up the people,</HI> ver. 13.
In <HI>Achaia, the</HI> Jews <HI>made insurrection against</HI> Paul, <HI>and
brought him before the judgment seat,</HI> Ch. xviii. 14. At
<HI>Ephesus,</HI> they would have heightened the rage of the
people, though <HI>the whole City was,</HI> before, <HI>filled with
confusion,</HI> Ch. xix. 33. When this <HI>uproar was ceased,
and</HI> Paul <HI>was about to sail into</HI> Syria, <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>laid wait
for him,</HI> Ch. xxi. 1—3.</P>
<P>NOR ought it to be supposed, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were
inconsiderable enemies. The malicious, however un∣furnished,
will always find some weapons; and rage
makes men, for a time at lest, strong and terrible. We
see a great deal of enmity against the first followers of
Jesus in the <HI>Jewish</HI> speeches and proceedings in <HI>Judea</HI>
and other parts. But perhaps it is not easy to form a
compleat idea of it. What vexation must it not have
given to the generality of this people, who were now
in full expectation of subduing the whole world to
<PB N="261" REF="279"/>
themselves, to see a number of men of their own na∣tion
travelling over the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> teaching that
Jesus, who had been crucified, was the Messiah,
the great King and Deliverer that had been promi∣sed
to the <HI>Jews;</HI> inviting <HI>Gentiles</HI> also to the parti∣cipation
of all the privileges of the people of God,
without insisting on circumcision or other rites of
their law!</P>
<P>THE peculiar principles, temper, and disposition
of the <HI>jewish</HI> people deserve to be somewhat farther
considered in this place. These were such, that tho'
the Roman Governours had taken the first Christians
into their special protection, they could not have se∣cured them from all injuries. The <HI>Jews</HI> then not on∣ly
scorned subjection and obedience to others, and af∣fected
liberty and independence, but they expected do∣minion
over all mankind. This we may perceive from
divers characters and admonitions in the <HI>New Testa∣ment,</HI>
and from the writings of <HI>Josepbus. They despise
governments,</HI> says <HI>St.</HI> Peter, <HI>presumptuos are they, self∣willed:
they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities,</HI> 2 Pet.
ii. 10. Jude 8. For this reason, there was so great oc∣casion
for those earnest exhortations to the believers
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> not to follow the example of the rest
of their countrymen, but <HI>to submit themselves to every
ordinance of man for the Lord's sake,</HI> I Pet. ii. 13. Again,
<HI>Let none of you,</HI> says the same Apostle, <HI>suffer as a mur∣derer,
or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busie body
in</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>other mens matters,</HI> I Pet. iv. 15. This last cha∣racter,
I apprehend, is not generally understood. A
meer prying into, or medling with the concerns of pri∣vate
families or particular persons would not have been
ranked with crimes that exposed to the severest censures
of the civil magistrate. The word, I think, in∣tends
one that affects the inspection and direction of
the affairs of other men: and in this place relates to

<HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Cesarea</HI> were not contented with equal rights

became after that, still more and more troublesome
and tumultuous. Their behaviour at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> just
now mentioned, is a proof of it The <HI>Jews</HI> disdain of
other men, and their thirst of dominion ran so high at
last, that they put the people of the several countries
in which they lived, and the whole <HI>Roman Empire</HI> into
a fright. They had been hated before, but now they were

<PB N="263" REF="281"/>
they had of some one from their country,
who would obtain the empire of the world, was the
great thing that induced them to the war with the <HI>Ro∣mans.</HI>
If the <HI>Romans</HI> were not able to preserve the
Heathen people from all injuries from the <HI>Jews</HI> (as it is
certain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vid Joseph, de Bell. lib. ii. c. 18. §. 1, 5. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> they were not) much less could they secure
the Christians, who were above all others the object
of their envy. And if the <HI>Jews</HI> thought themselves
able to contend with, and overturn the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI>
it cannot be supposed unlikely, that they should at∣tempt
to destroy a Christian, without asking the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
leave, when they would not do it for them.</P>
<P>THESE discouragements and sufferings then the
first Chtistians met with and underwent, whippings in
synagogues, excommunications from the ordinary
places of God's worship, beatings in public market
places; tumults, some that endangered, [<HI>Acts</HI> Xiv. 19.]
others that cost them their lives; [<HI>Ch.</HI> vii. 54—60.]
during the reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> imprisonment and
death; in the rest of this period, from the beginning
to the end of it troublesome prosecutions before Hea∣then
Governours in <HI>Judea,</HI> and out of it; the severest
reproaches, and dangerous conspiracies and lyings in
wait of the <HI>Jews</HI> in all parts; among the Heathen, the
scorn and ridicule of the great and the witty, insults
of the common people, and abuses of inferior magi∣strates;
lastly perils from false brethren, who might
find it no hard matter to augment the prejudices, both
of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> against a singular set of men.</P>
<P>IT maybe, I think, reasonably supposed, that the
sufferings of the followers of Jesus, in the period we
are now concerned with, were not equal to those,
<PB N="264" REF="282"/>
which they were afterward exposed to, when the Ro∣man
Emperours treated them? as public enemies, an∣thorized
their officers every where to punish them, and
countenanced the common people in those abuses and
outrages they were disposed to of themselves. Much
less did they equal the torments which good men
have undergone, since men of the most exquisite ma∣lice
and subtilty, in several ages, have improved per∣secution
into a science, and devoted themselves to this
work as their solemn businesse and profession; till at
length they have compleated this worst of all inven∣tions,
and with a dexterity truly diabolical have at
once increased the fatigue of the sufferer, and abated
the horrour and companion of all heedless and inconsi∣derate
spectators. These things perhaps may, but
these only could make us think the difficulties, dan∣gers,
and sufferings of the first Christians, small.</P>
<P>BUT yet after all, if we duly consider the vast sen∣sibility
of human nature to pain and disgrace, I believe
it will be allowed, that the subsistence and growth of
Christianity under the discouragements it met with in
its very infancy, at a time when there had been but
few examples of patience and constance under suffer∣ings
in any case that bears any near resemblance with
this, are a strong argument in favour of its divine
original: and a proof, that they, who then embraced
it, and were steady in the profession of it, were,
upon the best evidences, fully perswaded of the facts
on which it depends; and were animated by the hopes
of that great reward, which is one distinguished article
of the Christian doctrine.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Jews</HI> appear to have been, in the
time of our Saviour and his Apostles,
very zealous for the temple, and devout
and exact in the observation of the rituals
of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law. The <HI>New Testament</HI>
abounds with proofs of this zeal. I shall
take notice of some instances.</P>
<P>§. I. THEY came up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the <HI>Feasts,</HI>
in great numbers, not only from those parts of <HI>Judea</HI>
that lay near the city, but also from <HI>Galilee,</HI> and like∣wise
from foreign countries, where they resided. <HI>He</HI>
[Jesus] <HI>left</HI> Judea, <HI>and departed into</HI> Galilee, <HI>John</HI> iv. 3.
<HI>Then when he was come into</HI> Galilee, <HI>the</HI> Galileans <HI>re∣ceived
him, having seen all the things that he did at</HI> Jeru∣salem
<HI>at the</HI> FEAST, <HI>for they also went unto the feast,</HI> ver.
45.—<HI>After these things Jesus walked in</HI> Galilee—
<HI>Now the</HI> Jews <HI>feast of</HI> TABERNACLES <HI>was at hand.</HI> His
<PB N="266" REF="284"/>
brethren therefore say unto him, depart hence end go into
<HI>Judea,</HI> that thy disciples also may see the works that thou
doest: For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret,
and he himself seeketh to be known openly: if thou do these
things shew thyself to the world, <HI>John vii. 1—4. This
reasoning of theirs is built upon the supposition, that
there would be a general resort at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>at the</HI>
feast of tabernacles, which was then at hand.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Jews PASSOVER</HI> was nigh at hand, and
<HI>MANY</HI> went out of the country up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> before the
passover, to purify themslves. Then sought they for Jesus,
and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple,
what think ye, that he will not come unto the feast?—
<HI>Ch. xi.</HI> 55, 56. And on the next day <HI>MUCH</HI> people that
were come to the <HI>FEAST,</HI> when they heard that Jesus was
coming to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> took branches of palm-trees and went
forth to meet him,—<HI>Ch. xii.</HI> 12, 13. And there were
certain <HI>GREEKS</HI> among them that came up to worship at
the feast,—<HI>ver.</HI> 23. See <HI>Acts i.</HI> 1—5.</P>
<P>I shall set down from <HI>Josephus</HI> evidences of all these
particulars.</P>
<P>“AT that time<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Year before Christ 3, or 4. It was the passover next after <HI>He∣roa</HI>'s death.</NOTE> the Feast was approaching, in
which the <HI>Jews</HI> are wont to eat unleavened bread.
The Feast is called the Passover, and is kept in re∣membrance
of their departure out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> They
observe it with great Joy, and at this feast offer up
more sacrifices than at any other, and an innumera∣ble
multitude of persons come up to worship God,
not only out of <HI>Judea,</HI> but also from other parts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. Ant. 17. c. 9. §. 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AGAN IN, “When the Feast which is called the Pas∣sover
was nigh<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot"><HI>A. D.</HI> 48.</NOTE>, in which it is our custom to eat
unleavened bread, and a great multitude was gather∣ed
together FROM ALL PARTS<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, <HI>Cumanus</HI> fearing
some disturbance might happen among them, or∣dered
<PB N="267" REF="285"/>
a cohort of the Soldiers to take their arms,
and post themselves in the porticoes of the tem∣ple
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ant. xx. c. 4. §. 3.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>AGAIN: “From <HI>Antipatris Cestius</HI> marched to
<HI>Lydda,</HI> but found no men in it, for all the people
were gone up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to the Feast<NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">A. D. 66.</NOTE> of Ta∣benacles.
However, meeting with fifty men, he
slew them all, burnt the city, and went forwards,
and pitched his camp at a place called <HI>Gabao,</HI> at the
distance of fifty stadia from <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI>
perceiving the enemy to approach to their Metro∣polis,
neglecting the Feast betook themselves to
their arms: and placing great confidence in their
numbers, marched out to the fight with loud shouts
but very little order, not so much as minding the
rest of the seventh day. For it happened to be
the Sabbath, which is respected and observed by
them above all others<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. ii. cap. 19. init.</NOTE>.” This <HI>Sabbath</HI> is the
day spoken of, <HI>John</HI> vii. 37. where it is called, the last
day. that great day of the <HI>feast:</HI> Of which <HI>Moses</HI> says:
<HI>It is a solemn assembly, and ye shall do no servile work
therein,</HI> Lev. xxiii. 36.</P>
<P>BUT the number of people, that resorted to <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>
upon these occasions, will appear more particular∣ly
from a computation, which the Priests made at the
Passover of this very same year<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>CESTIUS,</HI> just now mentioned, President of
<HI>Syria,</HI> desired the Priests to number the people, if they
had any way of doing it. “The Feast of the Passo∣ver
was then at hand, in which they kill sacrifices
from the ninth to the eleventh hour: and there is
concerned in each sacrifice a sort of fraternity, of at
the lest ten in number, and sometimes twenty. The
priests then endeavoured to gratify him, and they
found the number of sacrifices amount to two hun∣dred
fifty six thousand five hundred. And reckoning
<PB N="268" REF="286"/>
a company of ten to each sacrifice, the whole num∣ber
of persons must have been two millions and se∣ven
hundred thousand<NOTE N="E" PLACE="foot">There is some errour in one of these numbers in <HI>Josephus.</HI> For 256500, which was the number of the sacrifices, multiplied by ten make but 2560000. But Dr. <HI>Hadson</HI> says, that some are for reading the number of the sacrifices, 270000; which multiplied by ten makes the number of persons here mentioned.</NOTE>, and these all clean and
pure. For all leprous persons,—and all who are
under any kind of defilement are excluded from this
sacrifice, as are also the strangers that come up to
worship<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. 6. cap. 9. §. 3.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>THE concluding sentence of this passage is a proof,
that some strangers, <HI>Greeks,</HI> as St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xii. 20.]
calls them, did come up to the <HI>jewish</HI> Feasts. These
are the persons, who are called <HI>devout men,</HI> and <HI>men
that fear</HI> God. They are also termed Proselytes of
the Gate. If they had been Proselytes of righteous∣nesse,
that is, circumcised; they would have had a
right to eat of the Passover. For so was the law:
<HI>This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stiran∣ger
eat thereof. But every man's servant that is bought
for money, when thou hast</HI> CIRCUMCISED <HI>him, then shall
be eat thereof,</HI> Exod. xii. 43, 44.</P>
<P>IN another place <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that when this <HI>Cesti∣us
Gallus</HI> came to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> a little before this very
same feast of the Passover, he was surrounded by the
people there to the number of three millions, who
made their complaints to him against their own Pro∣curator
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. P. 1078. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Gessuis Florus:</HI> and, as Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI> has
observed, this number does mightily correspond with
the abovementioned computation; for if the num∣ber
of those who were clean was 2700000, it is easy
to conclude, that, if the unclean be added to this
sum, the number of all the people might be three
millions.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="287"/>
§. II. As there was a great resort to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
from all parts, at the Feasts; so they who resided at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> seem to have frequented the temple very
much at other times also. This appears very plainly
in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles. And they</HI> [all that believed]
<HI>continuing</HI> DAILY <HI>with one accord in the</HI> TEMPLE, Acts
ii. 46.—<HI>Now</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> John <HI>went up together into the
temple, at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour; and
a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried,
whom they laid</HI> DAILY <HI>at the gate of the</HI> TEMPLE, <HI>which
is called beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into
the temple.—And</HI> AIL PEOPLE <HI>saw him walking,</HI> Acts
iii. 1, 2—9. See <HI>Acts</HI> v. 20—25.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> tells this story of <HI>Alexandra,</HI> mo∣ther
of <HI>Herod's</HI> wife <HI>Mariamne. Herod</HI> lay<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">Year before Christ 28. vid Basnage. Ann. P. E.</NOTE> sick at
<HI>Samaria,</HI> and he was thought to be near his end.
“<HI>Alexandra</HI> was at that time at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and having
constant intelligence brought to her of his case, she
endeavoured to get the two forts, which are in the
city, into her own hands (one is properly a guard
upon the city, as the other is upon the temple) for
they who have these in their possession, have the
whole nation in subjection to them; because that
without these they cannot come to offer sacrifices.
But it is impossible for any <HI>Jew</HI> to omit these. They
can sooner cease to breath than neglect the worship
they are wont to pay to God<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">To <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 15. cap. 7. §. 8.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§. III. WE had just now mention made of the
<HI>ninth hour,</HI> as one of the <HI>Jews</HI> hours of prayer. Ano∣ther
hour of prayer is referred to in another place.
When the Disciples had been filled with the Holy
Ghost, after our Saviour's ascension, and spake with
divers tongues, there was a reflexion cast upon them:
<HI>Others mocking, said, these men are full of new wine,</HI>
Acts ii. 13. St. <HI>Peter</HI> confutes them in this manner:
<PB N="270" REF="288"/>
<HI>For thsse are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but
the</HI> THIRD HOUR OF THE DAY, <HI>ver.</HI> 15. The argu∣me0nt
depends on the custom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who used
to attend their morning prayer, fasting.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says: “Twice every day, in the
morning and at the ninth hour, the priests perform
their duty at the altar, and omit not the sacrifices,
though in the greatest distresse of a siege<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 14. c. 4. §. 3.</NOTE>.” These
then were the two hours of performing sacrifices at
the temple: and it is likely, that a great number of
devout <HI>Jews</HI> who lived at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> usually went up
to the temple at those hours.</P>
<P>§. IV. THE <HI>Jews</HI> are represented to have had a
very high veneration for the temple, as not able to
hear any thing said of it, that was not honourable;
and as solicitous to preserve it from every thing which
they thought a pollution of it. <HI>And set up false wintenes∣ses,
which said, this man</HI> [Stephen] <HI>ceaseth not to speak
blasthemous words against this</HI> HOLY PLACE <HI>and the
law.—</HI> Acts Vi. 13. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>which were of Asia stir∣red
up all the people, and laid hands on him</HI> [Paul], <HI>cry∣ing
out, Men of</HI> Israel <HI>help: This is the man that teach∣eth
all men every where against the people, and the
law, and</HI> THIS PLACE. <HI>And farther, brought</HI> Greeks
<HI>into the temple, and hath polluted this</HI> HOLY PLACE. <HI>Ch.</HI>
xxi. 28, 29.</P>
<P>I have already given in this work, from <HI>Philo</HI> and
<HI>Josephus,</HI> many evidences of the veneration, the <HI>Jews</HI>
of this time had for the Temple. I add here one
passage more from <HI>Philo,</HI> in which the <HI>jewish</HI> resolution
to preserve the purity of the temple is represented by
him in the strongest terms that can be used. “One
thing, <HI>says he,</HI> we desire instead of all others, that
no novelty be introduced into the temple, but that
it be preserred such as we have received it from our
forefathers. If we cannot obtain this, we yield up
<PB N="271" REF="289"/>
our selves to be destroyed, that we may not live to
see a greater evil than death<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ev <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de leg. p. 1025. E.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WE must pursue the story of the <HI>Jews</HI> seising St. <HI>Paul</HI>
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> though it was transcribed above upon a∣nother
occasion. <HI>And all the city was moved, and the
people ran together: and they took</HI> Paul, <HI>and drew him
out of the temple.—And as they went to kill him, tidings
came to the chief captain of the band, that all</HI> Jerusalem
<HI>was in an uproar,</HI> &amp;c. Ch. xxi. 30—32.</P>
<P>A soldier, of the Roman guard at the temple, had
been guilty of a very indecent action there, and vent∣ed
some rude expressions in the hearing of the <HI>Jews.</HI>
“At this the whole multitude was moved with indig∣nation,
and cried out, that <HI>Cumanus</HI> ought to punish
the soldier. But some young people, and others
with them of a warm disposition, immediately made
a tumult, and began to throw stones at the soldiers.
<HI>Cumanus</HI> fearing lest all the people should make an
assault upon him, sent for more soldiers. When
they had potted themselves in the porticoes, the
<HI>Jews</HI> were thrown into a prodigious fright, and fled
from the temple into the city. So great was the
croud in the passages, that ten thousand were pressed
or trod to death<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. ii. cap. 12. §. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THESE two cases have this difference, that in the
latter there had been a manifest affront offered to the
temple; but in the former, they only supposed there
had been one. For the rest, there is a great agree∣ment:
the temper of the people is much the same,
and they were for immediately doing themselves ju∣stice:
and a strong body of soldiers is brought to keep
the peace.</P>
<P>§ V. THE <HI>Jews</HI> great respect for the law appears
in some texts already transcribed in this chapter, and
<PB N="272" REF="290"/>
in many other places of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> some of
which cannot but occur to the reader's thoughts.</P>
<P>NOT long after the just mentioned insolence at the
temple, “A soldier having found the sacred law in a
certain village, tore the book to pieces, and threw it
into the fire. The <HI>Jews</HI> were hereupon no less asto∣nished
than if the whole country had been in flames;
and all with one accord out of concern for their re∣ligion,
as if moved by one common spring, flocked
to <HI>Cumanus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>A. ibid. §. 2.</NOTE> at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> and intreated him, that
the man, who had offered this affront to God and
the law, might not go unpunished. He perceiving
the multitude was not to be appeased, unlesse some
satisfaction were given them, ordered the soldier to
be brought forth, and to be had through the croud
of his accusers, and put to death.”</P>
<P>§. VI. BESIDE the great resort to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
the feasts, and the worship at the temple at other sea∣sons,
and the regard expressed for the temple itself
and the law, we have in the <HI>New Testament</HI> frequent
mention of the <HI>Synagogue worship. And he</HI> [Jesus] <HI>came
to</HI> Nazareth, <HI>and as his custom was, he went into the sy∣nagogue
on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet</HI>
Esaias, <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 17—20. <HI>For</HI> Moses <HI>of old time hath
in every city them that preach him, being read in the st∣nagogues
every sabbath day,</HI> Acts xv. 21.</P>
<P>NOR had they only readings of the Law and the
Prophets, but they had discourses made in their syna∣gogues. <HI>And when be was come into his own country, he</HI>
TAUGHT <HI>them in their Synagogue.</HI>—Matth. xiii. 54.
<HI>And straitway on the Sabbath day, he entered into their
Synagogue and</HI> TAUGHT,—Mark i. 21. <HI>And it came
to pass in</HI> Iconium, <HI>that they went both together</HI> [Paul
<HI>and</HI> Barnabas] <HI>into the Synagogue of the</HI> Jews, <HI>and so</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="291"/>
SPAKE, <HI>that a great multitude both of the</HI> Jews <HI>and also
of the</HI> Greeks <HI>believed,</HI> Acts xiv. 1.</P>
<P>A passage or two from <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Philo</HI> will con∣firm
both these particulars. <HI>Josephus</HI> in his second
book against <HI>Apion,</HI> speaking of <HI>Moses,</HI> says: “And
that men might not have the pretense of ignorance
for their transgression (<HI>in points he before mentioned</HI>)
he gave us the Law, the most excellent of all insti∣tutions.
Nor did he appoint, that it should be
heard once only, or twice, or often, but that laying
aside all other works, we should meet together every
week to hear it read, and gain a perfect under∣standing
of it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> P. 1378. in.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> relates a difference which happened
between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Cesarea</HI> in the 12th
year of <HI>Nero's</HI><NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">A. D. 66.</NOTE> reign. The <HI>Jews</HI> presented a pe∣tition
to <HI>Florus</HI> their Procurator. He made them fair
promises, but immediately went from <HI>Cesarea</HI> to <HI>Se∣baste,</HI>
without taking care about the matter.—“The
next day, being the seventh day, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were
coming to the SYNAGOGUE, a turbulent fellow of <HI>Ce∣sarea</HI>
brought an earthen vessel, and having placed
it with the bottom uppermost, sacrificed birds, as
the <HI>Jews</HI> were coming in. This provoked the <HI>Jews</HI>
extremely to see their laws thus insulted, and the
place defiled.”—It was impossible to compose them,
they and the <HI>Cesareans</HI> had a battle. <HI>Jucundus</HI> a Ro∣man
officer who was there, came in to the assistance of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> but he had but a few men with him. “He
being overpowered by the violence of the <HI>Cesareans,</HI>
the <HI>Jews</HI> TAKING THE LAWS, withdrew to <HI>Narbata,</HI>
a place sixty Stadia distant from <HI>Cesarea</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib, ii. c. 14. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="292"/>
THERE should be some evidence of their having
discourses made in their synagogues. This I shall
give in the words of <HI>Philo.</HI>—“And from that time
[<HI>the days of Moses</HI>] to this, the <HI>Jews</HI> are wont to in∣culcate
the principles of their religion on the seventh
days, setting apart that time to the study and con∣templation
of the things of nature: for the oratories,
which are in every city, what are they but schools
of wisdom, of fortitude, sobriety, justice, and pie∣ty,
and of every virtue<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">A <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> lib. iii. de. vit. Mos. p. 685. D.</NOTE>?”</P>
<P>I believe, that very few of our modern <HI>jewish</HI> An∣tiquaries
are of <HI>Philo</HI>'s and <HI>Josephus</HI>'s opinion, that the
synagogue worship is an institution of <HI>Moses;</HI> but I
think, none will contest their authority, that the <HI>Jews</HI>
frequented the synagogues on the sabbath day at the
time they wrote.</P>
<P>§. VII. WHEN <HI>Paul</HI> had been acquitted by <HI>Gallio</HI>
at <HI>Corinth,</HI> it is said: <HI>After this he tarried there yet
a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and
sailed thence into</HI> Syria, <HI>and with him</HI> Priscilla <HI>and</HI>
Aquila: <HI>having shorn his head in</HI> Cenchrea: <HI>for he had
a vow. And be came to</HI> Ephesus,—<HI>and from thence
he sailed to</HI> Cesarea, <HI>and went up to</HI> Jerusalem. <HI>Acts</HI>
xviii. 18. We have again mention made of this very
same custom, or one very near akin to it, when <HI>Paul</HI>
went up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> several years after this; and
<HI>James</HI> and all the elders that were there gave him some
advice for the taking off the aspersions, that had been
cast upon him by the <HI>Jews. Do therefore this that we
say unto thee: We have four men which have a vow on
them; them take and purify thyself with them, that they
may shave their heads,</HI> Acts xxi. 23, 24. <HI>Then</HI> Paul
<HI>took the men and the next day purifying himself with them
entered into the temple, to signifie the accomplishment of the
<PB N="275" REF="293"/>
days of purification, until that an offering should be offered
for every one of them,</HI> ver. 26.</P>
<P>THE reader may do well to consult here the law of
the <HI>Nazarite</HI> as delivered by <HI>Moses,</HI> Numb. vi. 13—18.</P>
<P>THAT this custom was in use among the <HI>Jews</HI> at
the time of the evangelical history, is evident from
what <HI>Josephus</HI> has said of <HI>Bernice.</HI> “She was then<NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">A. D. 66.</NOTE>
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> performing a vow to God: for it is
customary for those who have been afflicted with
some distemper, or have laboured under any other
difficulties, to make a vow, thirty days before they
offer sacrifices, to abstain from wine, and shave the
hair of their head<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Hierosolymis quippe age∣bat ut vota Deo solveret: nam iis qui morbo laboraverant, aut in au∣gustias quascunque conjecti suerant, moris erat precibus vacare xxx. diebus, antequam victimas oblaturi essent, &amp; vino abstinere &amp; radere comam. de Bell. lib. ii. c. 15. init. Upon a review, I find my tran∣slation of this passage is somewhat different from the common inter∣pretation. And therefore I have subjoined Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI>'s version to the original. But I can see no reason why <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> should berender'd <HI>rare,</HI> as in <HI>Rifinus</HI>'s version, or <HI>precibus vacare,</HI> as in Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI>'s since they have translated <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>ut vota <HI>deo</HI> solveret. Be∣sides, prayer is not mentioned in the law of the <HI>Nazarite;</HI> nor is it ever reckoned up, that I know of, in the catalogue of the ten, pre∣cepts and prohibitions, which belonged to <HI>Nazarite.</HI> Vid Re∣land. Ant. Heb. de personis sacris. p. 274.</NOTE>.”.</P>
<P><HI>CAPPELLUS</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spiceleg. in Act. Apost. xxi. 23.</NOTE> indeed does make a doubt,
whether the vow of the four men in the <HI>Acts,</HI> or of
<HI>Bernice</HI> in <HI>Josephus,</HI> be the vow of the <HI>Nazarite.</HI> But
I see no good reason for this doubt. However he al∣lows
theirs and <HI>Bernice's</HI> vow to have been of one and
the same nature.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says, it was a custom to make a
vow of <HI>thirty days.</HI> There is no particular time pre∣scribed
for the vow of the <HI>Nazarile</HI> in the law of <HI>Mo∣ses.</HI>
And it is my opinion, that the only reason of <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>'s
<PB N="276" REF="294"/>
mentioning this particular number here, was,
because this happened to be the term of <HI>Bernice</HI>'s vow,
of which he had occasion to speak.</P>
<P>THERE may be a difficulty raised with reference
to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s vow at <HI>Cenchrea:</HI> because the <HI>jewish</HI> wri∣ters
say, that a <HI>Nazarite</HI> ought not to be out of the
land of <HI>Israel;</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nec licebat Naziraeo esse extra terram Israeliticam. Nazir. iii. 6. Reland. ubi supra, p. 277.</NOTE> and in the law of <HI>Moses</HI> it is said:
<HI>the</HI> Nazarite <HI>shall shave the head of his separation, at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation,</HI> Numb. vi. 18.
This is some difficulty: but I am very much inclined
to think, that notwithstanding all their zeal, they did
at this time dispense with the exactnesse of many things
required in the law of <HI>Moses.</HI> It seems to be the ne∣cessary
consequence of their living, as there now did
great numbers of them, at a vast distance from <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI>
Was there any law more express than this:
<HI>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
Lord thy God in the place that he shall choose,</HI> Deut. xvi.
16. Exod. xxiii. 17. But this they could not do who
lived in <HI>Italie</HI> or <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, it seems there is a rule in the <HI>jewish</HI>
books, <HI>that they who make the vow of the</HI> Nazarite <HI>out
of the land of</HI> Israel <HI>shall go into it to compleat the</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Si quis vovisset Nazi∣reatum extra terrain, prosicisci debuit in terram, &amp; illic votum im∣plere. Eduioth iv. 11. apud Reland. ubi supra.</NOTE> <HI>vow.</HI>
This will go a great way towards solving the difficulty,
if it will but be allowed, that this was the reason of
St <HI>Paul</HI>'s great concern to <HI>keep the next feast at Jeru∣lem.</HI>
Thus St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account stands. After <HI>Paul</HI>
was come to <HI>Corinth.—Then spake the Lord to</HI> Paul <HI>in
the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold
not thy peace. For I am with thee; and no man shall set
on thee to hurt thee.—And when</HI> Gallio <HI>was the deputy
of</HI> Achaia, <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>made insurrection with one accord
against</HI> Paul; <HI>and brought him to the judgment seat.</HI>
Paul was now in a great danger and was delivered.
<HI>And</HI> Paul <HI>after this, tarried there yet a good while, and
<PB N="277" REF="295"/>
then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into</HI>
Syria, <HI>and with him</HI> Priscilla <HI>and</HI> Aquila, <HI>having shorn
his head in</HI> Cenchrea: <HI>for he had a vow. And he came
to</HI> Ephesus, <HI>and left them there: but he himself entered
into the Synagogue, and reasoned with the</HI> Jews. <HI>When
they desired him to stay longer time with them he consented
not: but bade them farewel, saying, I must by all means
keep this feast that cometh</HI> IN JERUSALEM.—<HI>And he sail∣ed
from</HI> Ephesus. <HI>And when he had landed at</HI> Cesarea,
<HI>and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to</HI> An∣tioch,
<HI>Acts</HI> xviii. 9—22.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in this relation, that contra∣dicts
the supposition, that St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s vow was the occa∣sion
of his going to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at this time: or in other
words, that he went thither to compleat his vow and
offer the appointed Sacrifices; but there is a great deal
to countenance it. The Lord had appeared to <HI>Paul,</HI>
and promised to stand by him. <HI>Paul</HI> had actually
been in a great danger, and received a very signal de∣liverance.
It is likely, that at this season, or soon af∣ter,
he made a vow: and perhaps had made the en∣gagement
to take the vow, when the Lord appeared
to him.</P>
<P>THE account of his setting out from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and
going to <HI>Syria</HI> begins with the mention of the vow;
and <HI>Paul</HI> makes all possible expedition to get to <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI>
When he comes thither he makes no long
stay: And the <HI>saluting the church</HI> could not be the
principal end of this journey, for <HI>that</HI> imports no
more than a compliment of civility. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> it is
true, does not mention expressly any thing, which
<HI>Paul</HI> did at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> beside saluting the church:
But there was no necessity he should. The occasion of
his going thither appears in the beginning of the ac∣count.
And it is likely, that this was then so well
understood, that he could not be more particular with∣out
an unnecessary repetition. Throw away this de∣sign,
and St. <HI>Luke</HI> has been guilty of a very great
omission: and, though <HI>Paul</HI> was in great haste to get
<PB N="278" REF="296"/>
to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there is no hint at all, what was aimed
at in the journey. Take in this design, and then we
have here a compleat story.</P>
<P>IT is true, St. <HI>Paul</HI> says: <HI>I must by all means keep</HI>
THIS FEAST <HI>that cometh in</HI> Jerusalem. But the feast
time was not the only reason, because <HI>Paul</HI> did not
keep every feast there. There was some particular in∣ducement
to this feast; which seems to me to be this:
St. <HI>Paul</HI> was obliged, on the account of his vow, to
go to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> about this time. And, a feast then
approaching, it was certainly mod eligible to be there
at that season.</P>
<P>I have taken no notice of <HI>Grotius</HI>'s<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In Act. xviii. 18.</NOTE> opinion, who
thought it was <HI>Aquila,</HI> and not <HI>Paul,</HI> who had this
vow at <HI>Cenchrea:</HI> because, though there may be some
ambiguity in the words themselves; yet the whole
thread of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s narration renders it much more
probable, if not certain, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> is the person
spoken of. And learned men seem to be generally
convinced of it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitby in loc. Cleric. Hist. Ecc.
An. 54. n. I. Basnage. Ann. P. E. Vol. i. p. 657. n. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>vow at Cenchrea,</HI> whether <HI>Paul</HI>'s or <HI>Aquila</HI>'s
and <HI>the four men</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem who had a vow,</HI> are an
argument that this piece of devotion was not uncom∣mon
among the <HI>Jews</HI> at this time. <HI>Josephus</HI> has assu∣red
us expresly it was not. But there is something very
particular in the advice given to <HI>Paul,</HI> namely, that
he <HI>should take these men and be at charges with them that
they may</HI> SHAVE THEIR HEADS, <HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 24.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> This
may incline us to suppose, that it was an usual thing
now, for zealous men, who had it in their power, to
bear the whole, or at lest a part of the charges, which
a <HI>Nazarite</HI> was to be at, when his vow was expired.
It seems to have been a pretty heavy offering which
was required of them. Perhaps this might give rise to
this custom: But whatever was the reason of it, it ap∣pears
to have been a common practice.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="297"/>
THE Emperour <HI>Claudius,</HI> in the beginning of his
made <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> King of all <HI>Judea.</HI> “And
he (<HI>Josephus</HI> says) as it was very likely for one to
do, who had had so considerable an advancement,
made all the expedition he could into his kingdome;
and coming to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he offered up sacrifices of
thanksgiving, and omitted nothing that was prescri∣bed
by the law. For which reason, he also order'd
a good number of <HI>Nazarites</HI> to be shaved<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Jos. Ant. xix. c. 6. init.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AND here we have a remarkable agreement be∣tween
the stile of St. <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Josephus.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> does
not say,—<HI>Be at charges with them,</HI> that they may per∣form
sacrifices, or make their offerings, but that they
may SHAVE <HI>their heads.</HI> We learn from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that
this was the common phrase among the <HI>Jews</HI> at this
time.</P>
<P>WE see likewise, how very proper this advice gi∣ven
by the brethren was to answer the purpose, for
which it was intended. It seems to have been a popu∣lar
action. It was one of those things by which <HI>Agrip∣pa</HI>
obliged the <HI>Jews,</HI> when he took possession of the
kingdome.</P>
<P>§. VIII. St. <HI>Paul</HI> says: <HI>Of the</HI> Jews <HI>five times recei∣ved
I forty stripes save one,</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 24. The number
of stripes limited by <HI>Moses</HI> was forty. <HI>Forty stripes he
may give him and not exceed,</HI> Deut. xxv. 3. But the
<HI>Jews,</HI> at this time, understood themselves to be con∣sined
to thirty-nine. For so <HI>Josephus</HI> give us this Law
of <HI>Moses:</HI> “He that acts contrary hereto, let him
receive forty stripes wanting one<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">O <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. iv. c. 8. §. 21.</NOTE> from the pub∣lick
officer.”.</P>
<P>§. IX. WE have in the <HI>New Testament</HI> divers exam∣ples,
of a strange kind of zeal, sometimes called, I
think, by learned men, <HI>private zeal.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> seem
not to have made any scruple at all of putting a man to
<PB N="280" REF="298"/>
de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th without any the left form of a legal processe, if
he had said or done any thing which they judged a di∣minurion
of their religion. There were several attempts
of this kind made upon the life of our Saviour, <HI>Luke.</HI> iv.
28, 29. <HI>John</HI> viii. 59. We have many instances of such
attempts made upon <HI>Paul,—And when the Jews</HI> LAID
WAIT <HI>far him,—he purposed to return through Macedo∣nia,</HI>
Acts xx. 3. This design was concerted by them
in <HI>Greece.</HI> Afterwards, when he was at <HI>Jerusalem, The</HI>
Jews <HI>which were of Asia stirred up all the people, and laid
hands on him.—And as they were about to</HI> KILL <HI>him, ti∣dings
came unto the chief captain of the band, that all</HI> Je∣rusalem
<HI>was in an uproar,</HI> Ch. xxi. 27—31.</P>
<P>THE next day after this popular tumult, that the
chief captain <HI>might how the certainty, wherefore he was
accused, he called the chief Priests and the whole council
together,</HI> and had <HI>Paul</HI> examined before them. But, a
dissension arising amongst them, he took <HI>Paul</HI> from
them and brought him again into the Castle.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> observing this, and finding they were
not like to obtain a sentence with the expedition they
wished for; and fearing possibly, they should never
get such an one as they desired; <HI>When it was day, cer∣tain
of them banded together, and bound themselves un∣der
a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink,
till they bad killed</HI> Paul. <HI>And they were more than forty
which had made this conspiracy. And they came to the
chief priests and elders, and said, we have bound our
selves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing till
we have stain</HI> Paul. <HI>Now therefore, ye with the coun∣cil
signifie to the chief captain, that he bring him down
to you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something
more perfectly cencerning him: and we, or ever he come
near, are ready to kill him,</HI> Acts xxiii. 10—15.</P>
<P>HERE are forty men, who enter into a conspiracy
to take away <HI>Paul</HI>'s life in a clandestine manner; and
they make no scruple to declare it to the council, re∣lying
upon their approbation. And it is plainly impli∣el,
that <HI>they</HI> entered readily into the measures they
were to take for the accomplishing this vile design.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="299"/>
THEY were now disappointed by the vigilance of
<HI>Lysias,</HI> who was chief captain at <HI>jerusalem</HI> under <HI>Felix.</HI>
But no sooner was <HI>Festus</HI> come into the province, but
they renew the same design. And, it is likely, they
hoped to have surprized their new Governour. It was
very fit, he should be gracious at his first arrival; and
how could he suspect any harm, who was as yet a
stranger among them? <HI>Now when</HI> Festus <HI>was come into
the province, after three days he ascended from</HI> Cesarea
<HI>to</HI> Jerusalem. <HI>Then the</HI> HIGH PRIEST AND THE CHIEF
OF THE JEWS <HI>informed him against</HI> Paul, <HI>and besought
him, and desired favour against him, that he would send
for him to</HI> Jerusalem, LAYING WAIT IN THE WAY TO
KILL HIM, <HI>Acts</HI> XXV. 1.—3.</P>
<P>IF we had remaining any considerable number of
the <HI>jewish</HI> writers, who flourished about this time, one
might justly expect, (if we have a true representation
of these facts) to find in them some traces of a princi∣ple,
that might produce such a behaviour, and possi∣bly,
some examples resembling those here related.
And though we have but very few of their writers
come down to us, yet we have authentic evidences of
a principle, which obtained amongst them at this time,
and which must necessarily have carried them into the
conduct here described.</P>
<P>WE have this principle laid down in <HI>Philo:</HI> He is
speaking of what may be done toward a <HI>Jew</HI> that for∣sakes
the worship of the true God. “And<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">K <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo. de Monarch. lib. i. p. 818. D. E.</NOTE> it is
highly proper, <HI>says he,</HI> that all, who have a zeal for
virtue, should have a right to punish with their own
hands without delay those who are guilty of this
<PB N="282" REF="300"/>
crime; not carrying them before a court of Judica∣ture,
or the council, or any magistrate whatsoever;
but to indulge the abhorrence of evil, the love of
God their minds are filled with, in the immediate
punishment of these impious wretches; reckoning
that they are for that time all things, Senators,
Judges, Praetors, Sergeants, accusers, witnesses,
the laws, the people; that nothing hindering, they
may without fear espouse the cause of piety.”</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> here recommends this conduct toward
those that forsake the true God, and he after this illu∣strates
his principle from the example of <HI>Phineas,</HI>
Numb. xxv. 7.</P>
<P>LET us next see, how <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks concerning
this point. When he has given the abridgement of the
Laws of <HI>Moses</HI> he says, that <HI>Moses</HI> having delivered
them, “called together the people with their wives
and their children, their slaves being present like∣wise:
and adjured them to observe his Laws.—and
that if any one of their kindred, or if any City should
attempt to alter or dissolve the form of government
they were under, they should both jointly and sing∣ly
[or <HI>publickly and privately</HI>] take vengeance of
them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>eos &amp; publlicè &amp; privatim ulciscerentur. Huds. vers. Antiq. 4. c. 8. §. 45.</NOTE>.—And if they were not able to take pu∣nishment
of them, they should however make it
appear, that such things had not been done with
their content. And the multitude swore so to do.</P>
<P>ONE would think from what <HI>Josephus</HI> here says,
that they understood this obligation to extend not on∣ly
to the case of idolatry, but to every breach of their
laws. If they did so, it must have occasioned many
extravagant attempts at this time; when, by means of
the Roman Power, they were unable, in the way of
legal processes, to gratify their zeal; which, it is
certain, ran very high at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="301"/>
WHAT <HI>Josephus</HI> says is the more to be regarded,
in that these books of his <HI>jewish Antiquities</HI> were pro∣fessedly
written by him for the information of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And therefore it cannot be sup∣posed,
he would give a more offensive view of this
transaction than was absolutely necessary to satisfy the
<HI>Jews</HI> of those times, who might happen to see his per∣formance.</P>
<P>BESIDE the discovery these two writers have made
of the principle itself, there is in <HI>Josephus</HI> a story of a
conspiracy against <HI>Herod,</HI> which may not be omitted.</P>
<P>“Now <HI>Herod</HI> deviated more and more from our
ancient customs, and by foreign inventions corrupted
our constitution which is inviolable.—He instituted
<HI>Quinquennial</HI> Games in honour of <HI>Cesar,</HI> and built a
Theatre at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>—The magnificence of these
works was admired by foreigners, but to the <HI>Jews</HI>
these things appeared to be a breach upon those
laws which they highly respected.—But nothing
disgusted them so much, as the trophies. Supposing
there were images under the arms, they were en∣raged
at the sight of them, it being contrary to our
Law to worship any images.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Herod</HI> knew very well how much they were pro∣voked.
But did not think it a proper opportunity
to use violence. Wherefore he endeavoured to ap∣pease
them by fair words: but in vain. For with
one consent they cried out, that they would suffer
any extremity rather than have images of men in
their city.—Whereupon, <HI>Herod</HI> took some of their
chief men into the theatre; and having ordered the
ornaments to be taken off, when nothing appeared
underneath but a naked piece of wood, the compa∣ny
smiled at the mistake.”</P>
<P>“The people seemed upon this to be brought into a
better temper.—But yet some there were, who still
retained the offense they had taken at these practises:
and esteeming the alteration of their laws to be the
beginning of all manner of evils,—thought it their
<PB N="284" REF="302"/>
duty to run any hazard, rather than to seem to con∣nive
at <HI>Herod,</HI> who was forcibly introducing things
contrary to their customs, and who whilst he had the
name of King, was in fact the enemy of the whole
nation. Ten men therefore of the city, binding
themselves by an oath, to run all hazards together,
armed themselves with short daggers, which they
hid under their clothes. And there was a blind
man, who, being exceedingly moved at the reports
he had heard, offered himself, and took the same
oath with them. Not that he could give them any
assistance, but he was resolved to suffer with them,
if any accident befell them. And the zeal of this man
added not a little to their resolution.”</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> goes on to relate, that they entered
into the theatre, expecting <HI>Herod</HI>'s arrival, resolved,
if possible, to kill <HI>Herod</HI> himself; or if they failed
of that, a good number of his attendants. But one
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s spies, getting intelligence of the design,
prevented his going to the theatre. Being seised, they
remitted nothing of their firmnesse; they did not so
much as attempt to “deny their intention; but pro∣duced
the swords they had under their clothes, and
professed that the conspiracy they had entered
into was laudable and pious, and that they had
not entered into it for private profit, or any other
particular interest, but for what was much more
valuable, the ancient customs of their nation, which
it was fit that all should see observed, or die in the
defense of them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 15. c. 8. §. 1.—4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS conspiracy against <HI>Herod</HI> himself, with all the
circumstances here mentioned, must needs satisfie all
men, there is nothing improbable in the facts of this
kind related by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> According to all accounts,
this mad and furious zeal was not altogether so much
<PB N="285" REF="303"/>
in vogue, or at so great a height, in <HI>Herod</HI>'s time, as
it was afterwards.</P>
<P>§ X. As <HI>Judea</HI> was a Roman province, during
the time of our Saviour's ministry; so there appear,
in the history the Evangelists have given us, many
tokens of the unasinesse, which this circumstance gave
the <HI>jewish</HI> nation.</P>
<P>THE asking Jesus that question, <HI>Is it lawful for us
to give tribute to</HI> Cesar <HI>or not?</HI> Matt. xxii. 17. Mark
xii. 14. Luke xx. 21, 22. is represented as a very sub∣tle
artifice to ensnare him. There can be no doubt,
but it would have been judged an offense against the
government they were subject to, to say it was not
lawful: and it must have been unpopular among the
<HI>Jews</HI> to affirm it was: for otherwise there would have
been no extraordinary subtlety in this contrivance:
which yet it is plainly intimated there was.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, a <HI>Publican</HI> appears to have been a
very odious and ignominious character. They are
usually reckoned with <HI>Harlots</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our Lord went into the house of <HI>Zacheus,</HI>
this being done in the view of a great crowd of specta∣tors,
it is said, that <HI>all they who saw it, murmured,
saying, that he was gone to he guest with a man that is a
sinner,</HI> Luke xix. 7. They were surprised, and even
offended, that Jesus, whom they seemed then to have
considered as a prophet, should make a visit to a man
of that character; when they themselves, it is likely,
disdained to have any conversation with him.</P>
<P>IT is certain, the paying taxes to the <HI>Romans</HI> was
at this time a very heavy affliction to the <HI>jewish</HI> nation.
When <HI>Josephus</HI> gives the history of the <HI>census</HI> or enroll∣ment
of their estates by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI> was
deposed by <HI>Augustus,</HI> and had been banished into <HI>Gaul,</HI>
he says, “that the <HI>Jews</HI> were at first surprised at the
name of a <HI>census,</HI> but that, by the perswasion of
<HI>Joazar</HI> the High Priest, they generally acquiesced
in it. However <HI>Judas Gaulanites</HI> associating to him∣self
<HI>Sadduck</HI> a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> excited the people to rebelli∣on;
<PB N="286" REF="304"/>
on; told them that an assessement would introduce
downright slavery; and perswaded them to assert
their liberty.—The people heard their discourses
with incredible pleasure. And it is impossible to re∣present
the evils the nation has suffered, which were
owing to these men.—For <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Sadduc</HI> brought
in amongst us this fourth Sect; and there being
many who embraced their notions, they not only
caused disturbances in the government at that time,
but laid the foundation of those evils that followed:
which indeed are owing to this principle till then
unknown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. xviii. c. 1. § 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>HE then delivers the character and principles of the
three chief and more ancient sects of the <HI>Jews</HI> (as he
calls them) the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. §. 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>
<HI>Essenes.</HI> And afterwards returns again to the men he
had been speaking of before. “<HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean</HI> was
the leader of the fourth sect. In all other points they
hold the same sentiments with the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> But they
have an invincible affection for liberty, and acknow∣ledge
God alone their Lord and Governour. From
this time the nation became infected with this distem∣per:
and <HI>Gessius Florus,</HI> by abusing his power when
he was President, threw them into despair and pro∣voked
them to rebel against<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. §. 6.</NOTE> the <HI>Romans.</HI>”</P>
<P>WHAT is here transcribed from <HI>Josephus</HI> is enough
to convince us, that the paying tribute to the <HI>Romans</HI>
must have been very grievous to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and that
they who collected it for them, must have been scorned
and abhorred by the people: For he says, that <HI>Judas</HI>'s
and <HI>Sadduc</HI>'s Speeches were heard by them with incre∣dible
pleasure; that their principle had caused many
great evils to the nation, and that it was one ground
of the war with the <HI>Romans.</HI> But I must make two or
three remarks. <HI>Josepbus</HI> calls this a principle <HI>till then
unknown to them.</HI> But this<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>P. 792. 37.</NOTE> is not exactly true with∣out
<PB N="287" REF="305"/>
out some limitation. There was an oath of fidelity to
<HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> tendered to the <HI>jewish</HI> nation at the
latter end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign. But there were above six
thousand <HI>Pharisees</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ant. 1. 17. p. 753. 41.</NOTE> who refused at that time to take
it. <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that at the perswasion of <HI>Joazar</HI> the
High-Priest the nation generally acquiesced. Doubt∣less
the <HI>Romans</HI> carried their point; but yet a very
deep grudge remained in the minds of the <HI>jewish</HI> people.
And the service which <HI>Joazar</HI> had done the <HI>Romans</HI> up∣on
this occasion rendered him so unpopular, that it cost
him the Priesthood. These are the very words of <HI>Jo∣sephus:</HI>
“<HI>Cyenius</HI> having made a seizure of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
effects, and finished the <HI>census</HI> in the thirty seventh
year after the victory at <HI>Actium,</HI> constituted <HI>Ananus</HI>
the son of <HI>Seth</HI> High Priest, having taking away that
dignity and honour from the High-Priest <HI>Joazar,</HI>
who was overpowered by the seditions and tumults
of the multitude<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. 18. cap. 2. in.</NOTE>.' or in other words who had
been mobbed by the people.</P>
<P>LASTLY, <HI>Josephus</HI> calls <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> the head
of a <HI>fourth sect.</HI> But, though he uses these words here,
he oftentimes makes but three sects of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And I
think, that the sect of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> must generally have
held the same notion which he ascribes to <HI>Judas.</HI> The
six thousand, who refused to take the oath above∣mentioned,
were <HI>Pharisees. Josephus</HI> owns, that <HI>Ju∣das</HI>'s
followers differed from the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in nothing
else but this one principle of an excessive fondnesse for
liberty. He expressly calls <HI>Saddut,</HI> who joined with
<HI>Judas,</HI> a <HI>Pharisee.</HI> And I would fain know what sect
<HI>Judas</HI> had been of before. If he had been of the sect
of the <HI>Sadducees</HI> or <HI>Essenes, Josephus</HI> would have said
so. The case seems to me to have been thus: <HI>Judas</HI>
and they that held his principles were generally of the
SECT of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> but they were not PHARISEES;
because this title was more peculiarly appropriated to
<PB N="288" REF="306"/>
those, who had some distinction for their learning
riches, posts, employments; or to those who had a
great deal of leizure, and little else to do, but to make
an uncommon shew of devotion and sanctity. Thus, I
suppose, the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in general had this principle, but
the common people only avowed it. <HI>Josephus</HI> had a
difficult task. He was concerned to save the honour
of the supreme parts of the Roman Government, and
of the chief men of the <HI>jewish</HI> nation, and particularly
of those properly called <HI>Pharisees,</HI> of whom he was
one; and to throw the blame of the war, and all
their sufferings upon the cruelty and avarice of <HI>Albinus</HI>
and <HI>Gessius Florus,</HI> the two last Roman Procurators,
and the common people among the <HI>Jews</HI> and their
Leaders. This part he has acted very finely. But I
think, that if the <HI>Pharisees</HI> had controled this principle
sincerely, they might have suppressed it. For a proof
of this, I refer the reader to the chapter of the <HI>jewish</HI>
sects, where the power of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> appears very
evident. I shall here add only one passage more from
<HI>Josephus.</HI> “And on the account of these <HI>[Principles]</HI>
they [the <HI>Pharisees]</HI> are in great authority with the
people, and all parts of divine worship, whether
prayers or sacrifices, are performed according to their
interpretations. This testimony have the cities given
to their virtue, because of their following in all things
that which is best, both in <HI>their</HI> words and actions.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 18. c. I. §. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>§. XI. BUT though the Roman Tribute was a hea∣vy
grievance, and they who collected it were much
hated; yet it is evident, that many <HI>Jews</HI> were em∣ployed
in this work. The <HI>Publicans</HI> mentioned in the
Gospels, must have been of the <HI>jewish</HI> nation, <HI>Then
came</HI> also the PUBLICANS to be baptized, <HI>and said un∣to
him,</HI> [John] <HI>master what shall we do?</HI> Luke iii. 12.
<PB N="289" REF="307"/>
<HI>See</HI> Matth. xxi. 31, 32. It appears likewise, that some
of the <HI>Publicans</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> were honest persons, and
men of substance. Such an one was <HI>Levi,</HI> or <HI>Mat∣thew.
And</HI> Levi <HI>made him a great feast in his own house:
and there, was a great company of Publicans and of others
that sate down with them,</HI> Luke v. 29. <HI>See</HI> Matth. ix.
10. Mark ii. 4. Nor is there any hint of any unjust
practises which <HI>Levi</HI> had been guilty of in the post he
had enjoyed. And from the great opennesse and im∣partiality,
with which the Evangelists have writ their
history, it is reasonable to conclude, there was no
exception against <HI>Matthew</HI>'s character, beside his em∣ployment,
which undoubtedly was not reputable.
<HI>Zacheus,</HI> when he entertained Jesus, was certainly a
thorough convert to virtue. And, I think, he could
not have been a very wicked man before. <HI>And</HI> Za∣cheus <HI>stood and said,</HI>—<HI>Behold Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from
any man by false accusation, I restore him four fold,</HI>
Luke xix. 8. According to his computation, he sup∣posed
Himself capable of making ample restitution to
all he had injured, out of the remaining half of his
goods, and it is likely supposed he should have some∣what
left for himself. His unjust gains therefore were
but a small portion of his estate.</P>
<P>THAT there were <HI>Jews</HI> who were <HI>Publicans,</HI> and
that some of these were honest and wealthy men, will
appear from a story in <HI>Josephus.</HI> “There lay near
the <HI>jewish</HI> Synagogue at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> a piece of ground
in the possession of a <HI>Greek</HI> of the same place. The
<HI>Jews</HI> had often attempted to make a purchase of it,
and had offered a great deal more than the intrinsick
value. But the owner refused all their offers: and,
as if he intended to affront them, began to build
workhouses on the ground, leaving the <HI>Jews,</HI> but
a very strait and narrow passage. The warmer
part of the people attempted to obstruct the build∣ers.
But <HI>Florus</HI> not restraining these practises by
his authority,” the chief men of the <HI>Jews,</HI> among
<PB N="290" REF="308"/>
whom was <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Publican,</HI> not knowing well
what course to take, wait upon <HI>Florus</HI> and give him
eight talents of silver to stop the building. That he
might get the money into his hands, he promised all
they desired; but having received it went away
from <HI>Cesarea</HI> to <HI>Scbaste,</HI> leaving the riotous people
to themselves, as if the <HI>Jews</HI> had only purchased a
licence to quarrel.” And so it happened, the <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Greeks</HI> at <HI>Cesarea</HI> had a battle, in which the for∣mer
were worsted. Upon this <HI>John</HI> with twelve of the
chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> go to <HI>Sebaste,</HI> and coming to <HI>Florus</HI>
“make complaints to him concerning these proceed∣ings,
and entreat his assistance, modestly putting
him in mind likewise of the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. cap. xiv. §. 4, 5.</NOTE> eight talents.”</P>
<P>THIS <HI>John</HI> must have been one of the most conside∣rable
of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Cesarea,</HI> since he only is mention∣ed
by name. Nor is there any thing here said of him,
but what is very honourable; unless any think sit to
except against the giving a bribe to a bad man to do
what is in itself just and reasonable.</P>
<P>THERE is, in the Gospels, so frequent mention of
<HI>Publicans</HI> who were <HI>Jews,</HI> that I have been sometimes
inclined to think that the <HI>Roman</HI> tribute was collected
for the most part by <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> might choose
this method. The <HI>Jews</HI> imployed in this work became
odious thereby, but the Roman government was re∣lieved.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 14. §. 9.</NOTE> has made mention of several
<HI>Jews</HI> who were Roman Knights. It is certain that
the Roman Knights were the great<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Certè huic homini spes nulla salutis esset., si publicani, hoc est, si equites Romani judicarent. Cic. in Verr. lib. 3. cap. 62 n. 168.</NOTE> farmers and
collectors of the Roman tribute. It seems to me there∣fore
very probable, that those <HI>Jews</HI> had merited the
honour of Knighthood by their good services in some
part of the revenue.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="309"/>
I do not pretend to be master of the Roman method
of collecting taxes, but it appears to me not unlikely,
that in most provinces the natives were imployed in
the towns as the under Collectors, and that the Re∣ceivers
general or other superior Officers only were
<HI>Romans.</HI> It is plain that in the province of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> in
the time of the Republic, when a new assessement was
made there, (as it was every fifth year) <HI>Sicilians</HI> were
appointed to be the under <HI>Censors</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cic. in Verr. lib. ii. cap. 53. n. 131. &amp; seq.</NOTE>. The <HI>Publicans</HI>
were far from being beloved in any province<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sic porro nostros homines diligunt, ut his SOLIS neque publi∣canus, neque negotiator odio sit. ibid. cap. 3. n. 7.</NOTE>; the
<HI>Romans</HI> might therefore judge it prudent to imploy
some natives in collecting taxes: and it is probable,
that in all places, some would be found who were wil∣ling
to make an advantage of the subjection of their
Country, and accept places under the <HI>Romans</HI> their
masters.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the history of St. <HI>Paul</HI> there are many

alluded to. I shall here endeavour to
take some notice of all those we meet with
from the time of his being apprehended
at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to his confinement at <HI>Rome,</HI> excepting
only those which have been already observed in the
Chapter of the <HI>State of the</HI> Jews <HI>in</HI> Judea.</P>

thongs, <HI>Paul</HI> said unto the centurian that stood by, Is it
lawful, for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and
uncondemned? <HI>Acts xxii.</HI> 24, 25.</P>
<P>THREE or four things are here implied: that it
was customary for the <HI>Romans</HI> to use the <HI>question</HI> or
torture for the discovery of crimes, that this was some∣times
<PB N="293" REF="311"/>
done by <HI>beating</HI> or <HI>whipping,</HI> that it was unlaw∣ful
to <HI>scourge</HI> a <HI>Roman,</HI> especially <HI>uncondemned.</HI></P>
<P>§. I. IT was customary for the <HI>Romans</HI> to make use
of the <HI>question</HI> for the discovery of crimes. There are
many instances of it about this time in the history of the
<HI>Roman</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nihil enim exprimi quaestione potuit, Suet. In vit. August. 19.

reason to complain of the <HI>Romans</HI> putting this in
practise in their country, provided it was not done
when there were no grounds of suspicion: since <HI>Herod</HI>
the Great had openly practised it there<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 16. cap. 10. §. 2—5.</NOTE> before.</P>
<P>§ II. THIS was sometimes done by whipping or
beating. There were several ways of examining per∣sons,
some were used to Citizens or Freemen, others
were reckoned<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Et Q. Gallium praetorem—servilem in modum torsit: ac fa∣tentem nihil, jussit occidi. Sueton. Aug. c. 27.</NOTE> servile. But that scourging was
practised in this case, is evident from an example I
give of it from <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the reign of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Atque interim Nero recordatus Volusii Proculi indicio Epicharin attineri, ratusque muliebre corpus impar dolori, tormentis di lacerari jubet.

(a woman) among other tortures was so exa∣mined.
And it is observable that she was not then a

likely that a stick was<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Nullam existimationis in∣famiam avunculus tuus pertimescat ictibus fustium subjectus ob cri∣men quaestione habita, l. Nullam, c. vid. Grot. ibid.</NOTE> made use of in examining

<P>§. III. THIRDLY, It is intimated that it was un∣lawful
to scourge a <HI>Roman:</HI> which thing is also taken
notice of in the account of the treatment of <HI>Paul</HI> and
<HI>Silas</HI> at <HI>Philippi,</HI> Acts xvi. 22—37. <HI>Cicero</HI> says it
<PB N="294" REF="312"/>
was a crime to bind or whip a Roman<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Facinus est, vinciri Civem Romanum: Scelus verberari: in Verr. l. v. n. 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 0.</NOTE> Citizen. It
is one of his charges against <HI>Verres,</HI> that he had open∣ly
whipped a Roman at <HI>Messina,</HI> who had claimed the
privilege of the city, and when they were going to in∣flict
this punishment upon him cried out to the officers

done) <HI>I am a Roman Citizen</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Caedebatur virgis in medio foro Messanae ci∣vis Romanus, judices; cum interea nullus gemitus, nulla vox alia istius miseri, inter dolorem crepitumque plagarum audiebatur, nisi haec, CIVIS ROMANUS SUM.

<P>§ IV. BUT it was more especially unlawful to
punish a man uncondemned or before he had been
convicted. This the magistrates at <HI>Philippi</HI> did, but

§ V. FROM <HI>Lysias</HI>'s order to. examine St. <HI>Paul,</HI>
and from other things done by him me <HI>Jerusalem</HI> it
may be inferred, that he had there some sort of juris∣diction.
It appears from a passage alleged by me
above<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">P. 90.</NOTE> from <HI>Papinianus,</HI> that it was usual for Pre∣sidents
of Provinces to delegate part of their power
and authority to under officers. For this reason <HI>Cicero</HI>
advises his brother, then President of <HI>Asia,</HI> not only
to observe himself the rules of justice, but to have a
strict eye upon all the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nequaquam satis esse, ipsum hasce habere vir∣tues, sed esse circumspiciendum diligenter, ut in hac custodia provin∣ciae non te unum, sed omnes ministros imperii tui, sociis, &amp; civibus &amp; reipublicae praestare videare. ad Quint.

that there were at <HI>Cesarea</HI> officers under <HI>Felix</HI> who
had the power of whipping offenders.</P>
<P>I have in answer to <HI>Tertullus</HI>'s accusation given <HI>Ly∣sias</HI>
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 83.</NOTE> a great character. But perhaps some may
think, that this order for examining St. <HI>Paul</HI> by scourg∣ing
is unjustifiable. They may be of opinion that
here were not sufficient grounds of suspicion to put
him to the Question. To this I say: If I should here
abandon <HI>Lysias,</HI> my apology for him will, in some
respect, be strengthened by it. If <HI>Lysias</HI> here strained
a point in complaisance to the <HI>jewish</HI> multitude and
bore too hard upon his prisoner, <HI>Tertuilus</HI>'s complaints
will appear the more unreasonable. But I am still
inclined to think, that <HI>Lysias</HI> acted honestly herein.
<HI>Paul</HI> a stranger to him, and he could not but pay
some regard to the vehement and general clamour of
the people of the city in which he resided, and which
was the metropolis of the province. Any man in the
same case with <HI>Lysias</HI> would have been apt to conclude,
that <HI>Paul</HI> must have committed some offense or other,
<PB N="296" REF="314"/>
when <HI>they cried so against him.</HI> The method of enquiry
he had appointed was not fit to be practised upon a
Roman, but <HI>Lysias</HI> did not then know that <HI>Paul</HI> was
a Roman. In other respects it must have been unex∣ceptionable;
for I cannot but think, it was a more
gentle way of examining than some others then in use.</P>
<P>§ VI. AFTER St. <HI>Paul</HI> had been <HI>beaten</HI> at <HI>Phi∣lippi,</HI>
he complained of the injustice done him, because
he was a Roman. As they were <HI>binding</HI> him at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
he claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen,
and it was granted him: for it follows: <HI>When the cen∣turion
heard that, he went and told the chief captain,
saying, Take heed what thou dost, for this man is a Ro∣man.
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him,
Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. And the
chief captain answered, with a great sum obtained I this
freedom. And</HI> Paul <HI>said, But I was free born. Then
straighway they departed from him which should have
examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid after
he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound
him,</HI> Acts xxii. 26—29.</P>
<P>S T. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore does expressly affirm that he was
a Roman. Nor ought it to be thought strange that a
<HI>Jew</HI> should be a citizen of <HI>Rome.</HI> There were many
such instances about this time. <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> bestow∣ed
the freedom of the city upon <HI>Aniipater</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Joseph. de. Bell. l. 1. p. 978. v. 29.</NOTE> the
father of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, in consideration of services
he had done him. <HI>Philo</HI> says that there was a great
number of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Augustus</HI>'s time at <HI>Rome,</HI> who had
been taken captives, and carried thither, and who had
obtained their freedom from their mailers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De legat. p. 1014. C. E.</NOTE> <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
complains loudly, as well as very justly, of <HI>Florus</HI>
the last Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> “That he had been
guilty of an unheard of cruelty, and what had never
been done before, when he whipped before his tri∣bunal,
and crucified men of the <HI>Equestrian</HI> rank.
For, <HI>says</HI> he, though their extraction was <HI>jewish,</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="315"/>
their quality<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Jos. de Bell. l. ii. cap. 14. sin.</NOTE> was Roman. And our Historian
<HI>Josephus,</HI> who was <HI>jewish</HI> Priest, received the Free∣dom
of the City from <HI>Vespasian,</HI> after the war was fi∣nished,
as he has assured us himself.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">De vita. p. 945. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though there is no improbability, but that
St. <HI>Paul</HI> might be a Roman Citizen; yet it has been
a question how he came by this privilege. Some
learned<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Baron. Ann. A. 58. n. 147, 148. Hamm. Act. xxii. 27. Til∣lemont memoir: Ecclesi. Witsius de vita Pauli. Sect. 1. n. 6.</NOTE> men are of opinion, that <HI>Tarsus</HI> was a
Roman Colony, and that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was therefore a
Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> by virtue of his nativity at <HI>Tarsus.</HI>
But it will be worth our while to take a view of St.
<HI>Luke</HI>'s account of this matter. <HI>Lysias</HI> took <HI>Paul</HI> out
of the hands of the <HI>Jews. And as</HI> Paul <HI>was to be led
into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, may I speak
unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak</HI> Greek? <HI>Art
not thou that</HI> Egyptian—? <HI>But</HI> Paul <HI>said, I am a man
which am a</HI> Jew <HI>of</HI> Tarsus, <HI>a City in</HI> Cilicia, <HI>a citizen of
no mean City: And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto
the people,</HI> Acts xxi. 37—39. In his speech, <HI>St.</HI> Paul
<HI>tells the</HI> Jews, I <HI>am verily a man which am a</HI> Jew, <HI>born
in</HI> Tarsus <HI>a city in</HI> Cilicia, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 3.</P>
<P>WHEN the people had interrupted <HI>Paul</HI>'s speech,
<HI>the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the
castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging,</HI>
Ch. xxii. 23, 24. The chief captain therefore did not
suspect as yet, that <HI>Paul</HI> was a Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho'
he had been told by <HI>Paul</HI> he was of <HI>Tarsus.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI>
had also said the same thing at the beginning of his
speech to the <HI>Jews:</HI> But I do not insist upon that:
for though it is likely, the chief captain stood by, I
suppose he did not understand <HI>Paul,</HI> his speech being
made in the <HI>Hebrew Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>IT cannot be said, that the chief captain bade that
he should be examined with scourging, though he
knew <HI>Paul</HI> to be a Roman: because <HI>Lysias</HI> does not
<PB N="298" REF="316"/>
appear to be one of those fierce officers that have no
regard to lawes. Quite the contrary: As soon as <HI>Paul</HI>
had claimed his privilege, <HI>then straightway they depart∣ed
from him which should have examined him: and the
chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a
Roman, and because he had bound him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THEN the chief captain came and said unto him,
Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</HI> If <HI>Tarsus</HI>
had been a town of Roman Citizens, St. <HI>Paul</HI> having
before told the chief captain that he was of <HI>Tarsus,</HI>
the question now put would not have been, Art thou
a Roman? but, Art thou really of <HI>Tarsus?</HI></P>
<P>THE sequel of this discourse affords more proof,
<HI>The chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
this freedom. Lysias</HI> having purchased this privilege
with a great sum, and observing nothing considerable
in <HI>Paul</HI>'s person or mien, and supposing therefore that
he had no money to spare, he still makes a doubt of
the truth of his claim. This answer of <HI>Lysias</HI> had
been altogether impertinent, if <HI>Tarsus</HI> had been a
town of Roman citizens. <HI>And</HI> Paul <HI>said, But I was
free born:</HI> A plain indication, that it was a privilege
derived to him from his parents. And on this account,
the opposition between the chief captain's purchase and
<HI>Paul</HI>'s free birth is strong and beautiful. If <HI>Paul</HI>'s
freedom had been owing to his nativity in any place,
the place would certainly have been mentioned in this
conference between him and <HI>Lysias.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is observable that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has often men∣tioned
<HI>Tarsus,</HI> but never calls it a <HI>colony</HI> or <HI>municipium;</HI>
as he would have done, in all probability, if it had
been so. Upon the whole, I think it very plain, that
St. <HI>Luke</HI> does not suppose <HI>Paul</HI> to have been a Roman
by virtue of his birth at <HI>Tarsus.</HI></P>
<P>LET us now consider the external evidence, and
inquire what privileges the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> authors
ascribe to <HI>Tarsus. Strabo</HI> says, The people of <HI>Tar∣sus</HI>
were much given to the study of philosophy and
all other parts of polite literature: “That <HI>Tarsus</HI> was
<PB N="299" REF="317"/>
very populous, and reckoned the metropolis of the
country;<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>lib. 14. p. 991. A. B.</NOTE>” but he no where says it was a Colony
or Municipium. It has been thought by some that
<HI>Augustus</HI> conferred upon them the honour of the Citi∣zenship
of <HI>Rome,</HI> beside other privileges, as a reward
for their attachment to the interest of <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI>
and as a recompense for the hardships they suffered
from<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Vid. Tillemont Me∣mories Ecclesiastiques: St. Paul. Article premier.</NOTE> <HI>Cassius.</HI> But there is no proof of this. None
of the authors who have mentioned there matters say
any thing of the Citizenship. <HI>Appian</HI> says, “that
<HI>Mark Antony</HI> gave liberty, and immunity from taxes
to <HI>Laodicea</HI> and <HI>Tarsus,</HI> and ordered by a special
decree, that all citizens of <HI>Tarsus</HI> that had been ta∣ken
captive and sold for slaves<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Appi∣an. de Bell. Civ. l. v. P. 1077. ed. Amstel. Oct. 1670.</NOTE> should be set at
liberty.” <HI>Lucian says,</HI> that “at the request of <HI>Athe∣ned<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus,</HI>
of <HI>Tarsus,</HI> the stoic Philosopher, and pre∣ceptor
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> the City of <HI>Tarsus</HI> obtained free∣dom
from tribute<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Vol. 2 edit. Amst. P. 473. Macrob.</NOTE> <HI>Pline</HI> calls<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sydnus Tarsum, liberam urbem, procul a mari secans. Plin. l. v. c. 27. in.</NOTE> <HI>Tarsus</HI> a <HI>free
city:</HI> which is an uncontestable proof, it was not a
Roman Colony; for then he would have called it so.
When <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ciliciam vero Tarsus nobilitat urbs perspicabilis. L. xiv. c. 8.</NOTE> mentions <HI>Tarsus,</HI> he
speaks of it only as a considerable city of <HI>Cilicia. Ul∣pian</HI>
says there were two Colonies in <HI>Cilicia;</HI> but <HI>Tar∣sus</HI>
is not one of those which he mentions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Est &amp; in Bithynia (colonia) Apamena, &amp; in Ponto Sinopensis. Est &amp; in Cilica Se∣linus &amp; Trajanopolis. I. 1. § 10, 11. ff. de censibus.</NOTE>.</P>

treatise of Medals, as the source of the proofs he brings
<PB N="300" REF="318"/>
for the Citizenship of <HI>Tarsus.</HI> But though the Baron
did then suppose <HI>Tarsus</HI> had this privilege, yet, I think,
the arguments he uses are no proof of it, as he himself
was satisfied<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See his Orbis Romanus. p. 141, &amp;c. The edition which Mr. <HI>Tillemont</HI> refers to of <HI>Spanheim</HI> de Praestantia, &amp;c. is the Qto.

is stiled a Colony and a Free City. But though it
were a colony then, it is no evidence, that it was so,
when St. <HI>Paul</HI> was born; or that it was made a colony
by <HI>Augustus.</HI> And after all, the medal on which Mr.
<HI>Spanheim</HI> relied does not stile <HI>Tarsus</HI> a <HI>Colony,</HI> but
only a <HI>Free City,</HI> as he found afterwards<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ipsum vero EAEY<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EPA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seu Liberae nomen, quod eidem largitur Plinius (Lib. v. c. 27.) huic Ciliciae metropoli, in antiquo Regiae Gallorum Gazae (Specim.

<P>UPON the whole therefore, St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account is
fully confirmed by the best authorities. <HI>Tarsus</HI> was no
<HI>mean City,</HI> but it was not a Municipium, or town of
Roman Citizens.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY some may enquire, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
not a Roman Citizen, or entitled to some other pecu∣liar
privileges, by his being born at <HI>Tarsus,</HI> to what
purpose did he make any mention of it? I answer,
every one in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s circumstances is naturally led
to mention the place of his nativity, or residence;
especially when he is asked, who he is. But St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
innocence did not depend upon his being a <HI>Roman,</HI>
but a <HI>Jew.</HI> And therefore this last, together with
the place of his birth, is what he here mentions. The
outcry, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> was seised, was, <HI>Men of</HI> Israels
<PB N="301" REF="319"/>
<HI>help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where
against the people;—And farther brought</HI> Greeks
<HI>also
into the temple and hath polluted this holy place.—
And all the city was moved, and the people ran toge∣ther:
and they took</HI> Paul <HI>and drew him out of the
temple; and forthwith the doors were shut,</HI> Ch. xxi
28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> which were of <HI>Asia,</HI> who began the di∣sturbance,
knew well enough that <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Jew:</HI>
but the cry being, that the <HI>temple had been polluted,</HI>
and <HI>Paul</HI> being taken by them, and drawn out of the
temple, it is likely, a great part of the multitude
thought St. <HI>Paul</HI> had been a <HI>Gentile,</HI> who had gone
beyond the bounds prescribed to such: which when,
any one but a <HI>Jew</HI> had done, he was liable to the
heaviest punishment. Therefore, when the chief Cap∣tain
asked him who he was, he told him he was a
JEW of <HI>Tarsus;</HI> which was enough to satisfie him, the
<HI>Jews</HI> had no right to use him as they did, for going
into the temple. And it is observable, that imme∣diately
upon St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s beginning to speak: <HI>Men,
Brethren, and Fathers, hear ye my defence; when they
heard that he spake in the</HI> Hebrew <HI>tongue to them, they
kept the more silence.</HI> This for the present allayed the
heat, because it was a strong presumption, that he was
not a <HI>Gentile.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore had no reason, at this time, to
tell them he was a Roman Citizen; but it was of the
last importance to assure both the chief captain, and
the multitude, that he was a <HI>Jew.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not informed us, how St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Citi∣zenship
was derived to him. He <HI>was free born:</HI> But
what was the original of this privilege does not ap∣pear.
It seems to me however not unlikely, that some
of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s ancestors had obtained it for services
they had done the Roman Commonwealth in<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. in Act. xxii. 28.</NOTE> the
wars. The <HI>Jews</HI> had formerly served the Kings of
<HI>Syria</HI> in their armies, and afterwards, the <HI>Romans.</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="320"/>
But they had been long since discharged from that ser∣vice
upon the account of some religious scruples which
they had. There are in <HI>Josephus</HI> the copies of these
discharges given them at <HI>Ephesus, Delus</HI> and other
places. One of these discharges runs thus: “<HI>Lucius</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. l. 14. c. 10. §. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>Lentulus</HI> the Consul declared: I have dismissed from
the service the <HI>jewish</HI> Roman Citizens who observe
the rites of the <HI>jewish</HI> religion at <HI>Ephesus.”</HI> Again,
The Decree of the <HI>Delians</HI> is thus: “<HI>Baectus</HI> being <HI>Ar∣chon,</HI>
the order of the Praetors. <HI>Marcus Piso</HI> the
Ambassadour, who was also the officer appointed to
raise soldiers, being in our City, having called to∣gether
us, and a sufficient number of other Citizens,
gave orders, that if there were any <HI>Jews</HI> Roman Ci∣tizens,
no man should disturb any of them on the
account of military service; for as much as <HI>Cornelius
Lentulus</HI> the Consul had dismissed the <HI>Jews</HI> from the
military service on account of their religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. §. 14.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS may give ground to suppose, that a good
number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who served the <HI>Romans</HI> in some auxi∣liary
armies, had obtained the freedom of the city.
But, whether any of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s ancestors deserved it
this, or some other way, I do not determine: nor is
it necessary we should.</P>
<P>§VII. WE have sufficiently considered St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Citizenship. We must not however pass by what the
chief Captain said to him: <HI>With a great sum, obtained
I this freedom.</HI> It was often given to Men and Cities as
a reward<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">—Eoque Romana civitas olim data, cum id rarum, nec nisi virtuti pretium esset. Tacit. Ann. lib. iii. c. 40.</NOTE> of some special merit or services: but
that it was also bought, and that at a great price, ap∣pears
from a pasage of <HI>Dio,</HI> which I leave with the
reader. “He [<HI>Claudius</HI>] took away the freedom of
the City from many who were unworthy of it, and
he gave it without any reason to others, sometimes
<PB N="303" REF="321"/>
to single persons, at other times to great numbers
together. For <HI>Romans</HI> having the preference above
strangers, there were many who begged the Citizen∣sihip
of the Emperour; and others who bought it of
<HI>Messalina,</HI> or the freed men. By which means this
privilege, which had been bought formerly at a
great price, became so cheap, that merry people
would say, a man might be made a Roman Citizen
for a few pieces of broken glasse<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. 1. 60, p. 676. C. D.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>§ VIII. WE have already had occasion to observe
the Justice of the Roman Laws in forbidding to pu∣nish
any man till he had been tried and convicted. We
have something farther observable in the conduct of
<HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus,</HI> who refused to give <HI>Paul</HI>'s cause a
hearing, unless both parties, namely St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his
accusers, were present. <HI>Lysias</HI> sent <HI>Paul</HI> under a
strong guard from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Cesarea. Who when
they came to</HI> Cesarea, <HI>and delivered the epistle to the go∣vernour</HI>
[Felix], <HI>presented</HI> Paul <HI>also before him. And
when the governour had read the letter, he asked of what
province he was. And when he understood that he was
of</HI> Cilicia: <HI>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers
also are come,</HI> Acts xxiii. 33—35. xxiv. 7, 8. When
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem desired favour</HI> of <HI>Festus</HI> against
<HI>Paul,</HI> Festus <HI>answered, that</HI> Paul <HI>should be kept at</HI> Ce∣sarea,
<HI>and that be himself would depart shortly thither.
Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able,
go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any
wickednesse in him,</HI> Ch. xxv. 4, 5. This is somewhat
more particularly related, when <HI>Festus declared</HI> Paul's
<HI>cause unto the king</HI> [Agrippa], <HI>saying, There is a cer∣tain
man left in bonds by</HI> Felix. <HI>About whom, when I
<PB N="304" REF="322"/>
was at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>the chief priests and the elders of the</HI>
Jews <HI>informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.
To whom I answered,</HI> IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF THE
ROMANS <HI>to deliver any man to die, before that he which
is accused, have the accusers</HI> FACE <HI>to</HI> FACE, <HI>and</HI> HAVE
LICENCE TO ANSWER FOR HIMSELF <HI>concerning the,
crime laid against him,</HI> ver. 14, 16.</P>
<P><HI>CICERO,</HI> in his orations against <HI>Verres,</HI> the in∣famous
Praetor of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> continually represents these
as the most illegal and inhumane proceedings; that
he received accusations against men when they were
<HI>absent,</HI> and condemned<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Iste non dubitat jubere nomen deferri: &amp; tum primùm opinor istum absentis nomen recepisse.

And <HI>Tertullian</HI> makes mention of a Roman President,
who, when a Christian was sent to him with a Libel,

<P>§ IX. WE will now proceed to St. <HI>Paul</HI>' imprison∣ment.
I have deferred it till now, that we might
take in at once the whole account of this matter, from
his being taken into custody at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to his two
years confinement at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHEN</HI> Lysias <HI>heard that all</HI> Jerusalem <HI>was in an
uproar, he</HI> immediately took soldiers, and ran down to
them, and when they saw him, they left beating <HI>Paul.</HI>
Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and com∣manded
him to be bound with two chains, <HI>Acts xxi.</HI> 32, 33.
On the morrow, because he would know the certainty,
wherefore he was accused of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he loosed him from
his bands, and commanded the chief priests, and all their
<PB N="305" REF="323"/>
councel to appear: and brought <HI>Paul</HI> down and set him before
them, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 30. <HI>St.</HI> Paul was <HI>removed from</HI> Jerusalem
to Cesarea, <HI>and</HI> Felix commanded him to be kept in <HI>Herod</HI>'s
judgment-hall. <HI>The chief priest and others went down
thither, and accused him before</HI> Felix. <HI>After this hearing</HI>
He <HI>[Felix]</HI> commanded a centurion to keep <HI>Paul,</HI> and to let
him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his ac∣quaintance
to minister, or come unto him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiv. 23.—
But after two years, <HI>Portius Festus</HI> came into <HI>Felix's</HI> room:
and <HI>Felix</HI> willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left <HI>Paul</HI>
bound, <HI>ver.</HI> 27.—<HI>King</HI> Agrippa <HI>having said to</HI> Paul: Al∣most
thou perswadest me to be a christian; <HI>Paul</HI> said, I
would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me
this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, ex∣cept
these bonds, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxvi. 29. And when he had thus spoken
the king rose up,—and they talked between themselves,
saying, this man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.
<HI>After this St.</HI> Paul <HI>was carried to</HI> Italie, and when we
came to <HI>Rome,</HI> the centurion delivered the prisoners to the
captain of the guard: but <HI>Paul</HI> was suffered to dwell by
himself with a soldier that kept him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxviii. 16. After
three days <HI>Paul</HI> called the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> together. And
he said unto them,—For the hope of <HI>Israel</HI> I am bound
with this chain.—And when they had appointed him a
day, there came many to him into his lodging, <HI>ver.</HI> 20.—
And <HI>Paul</HI> dwelt two whole years in his own hired house,
and received all that came in unto him, preaching the king∣dom
of God, and teaching those things which concern the
Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no man forbidding
him, <HI>ver.</HI> 30, 31. <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>makes mention of his Bonds
in several of his epistles. But these places I need not
transcribe.</HI></P>
<P>WE have observed from <HI>Cicero,</HI> that it was unlawful
to <HI>bind,</HI> as well as to <HI>scourge</HI> a Roman Citizen: and it
is said, that <HI>the chief captain was afraid, after he knew
that he was a Roman, and because he had</HI> BOUND <HI>him.</HI>
And yet St. <HI>Paul</HI> was several years in <HI>Bonds.</HI> But there
is no inconsistence in this. A Citizen might not be bound
with thongs as a punishment, or in order to be scourged:
<PB N="306" REF="324"/>
But a Roman Citizen might certainly be kept in custo∣dy,
upon just suspicions, or when there were any credi∣ble
accusations brought against him. And there was
nothing at all illegal in the way, in which St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
confined. There are many instances in the Roman Au∣thors,
of Knights and Senators of <HI>Rome,</HI> who were
chained in the same manner that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">At claudius nihil ultra scrutatus, citis cum militibus,—Crispinum praetorii praefectum misit: a quo repertus [Valerius Asia∣ticus bis consul] est apud Baias, vinclisque inditis in urbem raptus.

<P>IN this history of St. <HI>Paul</HI> there is mention sometimes
of <HI>chains</HI> in the plural number, and at other times of
<HI>chain</HI> in the singular. when the chief captain <HI>took him</HI>
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> he <HI>commanded</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>him to be bound with two
chains,</HI> Acts xxi. 33. Whether St. <HI>Paul</HI> continued to be
bound with two chains so long as he was kept in <HI>Judea,</HI>
I cannot say; because, tho' the wore <HI>Bands</HI> be used ge∣nerally
afterward in the plural number, yet the word<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Act. xxii. 30.<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Act. xxvi. 29.</NOTE>
is of a general meaning, and may imply no more than
confinement, with one, or more chains. However it
is certain he was bound with but one chain whilst he was
at <HI>Rome:</HI> for it is said, that <HI>Paul was suffered to dwell
with a soldier that kept him,</HI> Ch. xxviii. 16. And he tells
<HI>the chief of the</HI> Jews, whom he had sent for there, <HI>that
for the hope of</HI> Israel <HI>he was</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>bound with this chain.</HI>
And in another place he says (though the text is gene∣rally
thought not to relate to this confinement), <HI>The
Lord give mercy to the house of</HI> Onesiphorus, <HI>for he ost
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my</HI> CHAIN, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI>
i. 16.</P>
<P>THE way of <HI>chaining</HI> prisoners was in this manner.
There was an iron chain of a convenient length, which
was fastened, at one end, to the hand of the prisoner,
<PB N="307" REF="325"/>
and at the other, to the arm of the soldier. When a
person was committed to the care of one Soldier, which
was a very common way, and consequently there was
but one chain, the chain was fastened to the right arm
of the ptisoner, and to the left arm of the soldier. This
is evident from a passage of<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Aliorum aurea catena est, &amp; laxa—sed quid refert? eadem cu∣stodia universos circumdedit. Allegatique sunt etiam qui allegaverunt. Nisi tu forte leviorem in sinistra catenam putas. Seneca de Tranquil. cap. 10. Quemadmodum eadem catena, &amp; custodiam &amp; militem c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pulat, sic ista quae tam dissimilia sunt, pariter incedunt. Id. Epist. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Seneca.</HI> It is easie to
conclude, that when a second soldier, and another
chain was appointed, the prisoner must wear the other
chain on his left hand, and the soldier on his right.</P>
<P>IT is likely, that this method of confinement ob∣tained
very much all over the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI>
was bound thus at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> then
King of <HI>Judea. The same night</HI> Peter <HI>was sleeping be∣tween
two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers
before the door of the prison,</HI> Acts xii. 6.</P>
<P>IT is observable, that when <HI>Lysias</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI> be∣fore
the council, <HI>that he might know wherefore he was
accused of the</HI> Jews, HE LOOSED <HI>him from his bands,</HI> Ch.
xxii. 30. But it is somewhat doubtful, whether St. <HI>Paul</HI>
had not his chain on, when he appeared before <HI>Agrippa;</HI>
for he says, <HI>I would to God that all that hear me this day
were altogether such as I am, except these bands.</HI> Perhaps
St. <HI>Paul</HI> means no more hereby than this state of impri∣sonment.
I think indeed that it was not a generous
treatment of his prisoner, nor very decent upon other
accounts, for <HI>Festus</HI> to set <HI>Paul</HI> before <HI>Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Ber∣nice,</HI>
with his chains on. However, there was a Ro∣man
of considerable quality, who was accused, and
made his defense before the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the reign
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> with his chains<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Iisdem consulibus miseriarum ac saevitiae exemplum atrox, reus pater, accusator filius, nomen utrique Vibius Serenus, in senatuam in∣ducti sunt.

<P><PB N="308" REF="326"/>
ST. <HI>Paul</HI> seems to have been under a <HI>military custody.</HI>
I need not remind the reader of any particulars for a
proof of this: It runs through the whole account. There
were however several changes of the manner of his con∣finement.
At first, he was carried into the Castle of
<HI>Antonia</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> chained undoubtedly to a soldier,
or soldiers, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxi. 37. xxii. 24. for that must be sup∣posed
all along. When he was sent to <HI>Cesarca, Felix
commanded that he should be kept in</HI> Herod's <HI>judgment-hall,</HI>
Ch. xxiii. 35. But there was some alteration made, af∣ter
that <HI>Felix</HI> had heard <HI>Paul</HI> and the High Priest and
others that came down from <HI>Jerusalem. And he</HI> [Felix]
<HI>commanded a centurion to keep</HI> Paul, <HI>and to let him have
liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance
to minister, or come unto him,</HI> Acts xxiv. 23. These
are certainly new orders, the former straitnesse
must have been hereupon abated; and perhaps the
place of confinement was changed. I am inclined to
think, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was now removed from <HI>Herod's
judgment-hall,</HI> to the Centurion's own habitation, or to
that part of the city where the soldiers had their
quarters.</P>
<P>BUT the most gentle easie confinement of all was
that which St. <HI>Paul</HI> had at <HI>Rome.</HI> There <HI>he was suffer∣ed
to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him,</HI> Ch.
xxviii. 16.—in his <HI>lodging,</HI> ver. 25.—<HI>in his own hired
house,</HI> ver. 30. This must have been owing very much
to the honourable testimonial, which <HI>Porcius Festus</HI>
transmitted with him, and in part, it is likely, to the
account given in by the Centurion, who had conducted
<HI>Paul</HI> and the other prisoners from <HI>Cesarea</HI> into <HI>Italie;</HI>
as also in part, and perhaps chiefly, to the goodnesse<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. xiv. c. 15, &amp; 51. Dio lib. lxii. p. 706. E.</NOTE>
of <HI>Burrhus</HI> then Prefect of the Praetorium or Captain
of the Guard to <HI>Nero.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were several methods of<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lipsiii &amp; Mureti notas ad Tacit. Ann. l. iii. c. 22. &amp; Lipsii Excur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> B.</NOTE> keeping pri∣soners
made use of in the City, and in the Provinces.
<PB N="309" REF="327"/>
<HI>Ulpian</HI> says, “That the Proconsul is wont to judge,
whether the person ought to be put into the prison,
or delivered to a soldier to keep, or whether he should
be committed to sureties, or even to himself,” (<HI>that
is, to the accused person himself</HI>). “And herein usually re∣gard
is had to the nature of the crime charged upon
any one, and to the preservation of his honour, as al∣so
to the wealth or substance, <HI>seeming</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Proconsul aestimare solet utrum in carcerem recipienda sit per∣sona, an militi tradenda, vel fidejussoribus committenda, vel etiam sibi: hac autem vel pro criminis, quod objicitur, qualitate. vel prop∣ter honorem, aut propter amplissimas facultates, vel pro innocentiâ personae, vel pro dignitate ejus, qui acculatur, facere solet. l. i. ff. de castod. &amp; exhib. reor.</NOTE> innocence,
or dignity of the party accused.”</P>
<P>IT is very easy to perceive, what was chiefly regarded
by those Roman officers who treated St. <HI>Paul</HI> so mildly,
not his wealth, not his dignity, but his innocence.</P>
<P>THERE is no one single instance that I know of,
that will so much illustrate the whole story of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
imprisonment, as that of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> who was im∣prisoned
by <HI>Tiberius</HI> in the latter end of his reign, and
afterward came to be King of all <HI>Judea,</HI> as has been
shewn already.</P>
<P>AGRIPPA had said some improper things of <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>
in the hearing of one of his own servants; who
having some time after taken a disgust at his master<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. l. xviii. c. 7. §. 5. p. 810.</NOTE>
went and inform'd <HI>Tiberius</HI> against him. <HI>Agrippa</HI> went
one day, as others did, to wait on <HI>Tiberius. Tiberius</HI> credi∣ting
what the servant had said, and bearing likewise some
grudge against <HI>Agrippa,</HI> ordered <HI>Macro</HI> the Prefect of
the Pretorium to bind him. Whereupon “the officers
took him and bound him in his purple dresse which
he was then in.'—But <HI>Antonia</HI><NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Widow of <HI>Drusus, Tiberius</HI>'s brother, a Lady so great virtue, and at good terms with <HI>Tiberius.</HI> Vid. Joseph. p. 812.</NOTE> was extremely
afflicted at this misfortune of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and yet she
judged it very difficult to say any thing to <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
his favour: and that indeed it would be to no purpose.
She therefore went to <HI>Macro,</HI> and desired that he
<PB N="310" REF="328"/>
would take care that the soldiers which kept guard
upon him should he civil, good natured fellows, and
that the Centurion who presided over the guard, and
the soldier<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> to whom <HI>Agrippa</HI> was bound, might
be men of the same character, and that his freed men
and friends might have accesse to him, and in a word,
that he might want nothing necessary for his health.
These therefore went to him, his friend <HI>Silas,</HI> and his
freed men <HI>Marsyas</HI> and <HI>Stoechus,</HI> who brought him
the provision he chose to have. They brought in
likewise bed-clothes and such like things as if they
were for sale, which they accommodated him with at
night, the soldiers themselves joyning with them in
these services, in obedience to <HI>Macro's</HI> orders. Thus
things went with <HI>Agrippa</HI> for six months<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 814, 815.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Tiberius</HI> was dead, “there came two letters
to <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Caius [Caligula],</HI> one to the Senate,
notifying the death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and his own accession
to the Empire; and another to <HI>Piso</HI> the Prefect of
the City containing the same things, and also ordering
that <HI>Agrippa</HI> should be removed from the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> Preto∣rium
to the house in which he had lived before he was
bound. Here indeed he was in custody, but however
he had more liberty, and was at ease. In a short time
<HI>Caius</HI> came to <HI>Rome,</HI>—and in a few days after, sent
for <HI>Agrippa</HI> to his palace, ordered him to be shaved,
and changed his garments; and then put a Diadem
on his head—and made him also a present of a gold
chain of the same weight with the iron one with which
he had been<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 818.</NOTE> bound. This chain <HI>Agrippa</HI> after∣ward
laid up in the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as a monu∣ment
that God can bring down those things that are
great, and raise up those things which are<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Id. l. 19. c. 6. in.</NOTE> fallen.”</P>
<P>I take it, that <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s first confinement was of the
same kind with that, which was allotted St. <HI>Paul</HI> by
<HI>Felix,</HI> after the first hearing at <HI>Cesarea;</HI> with this dif∣ference
however, that a good deal of <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s kind
<PB N="311" REF="329"/>
usage was given him by stealth, it not being by the or∣ders
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> by whom he was committed: Where∣as,
the Centurion, who kept St. <HI>Paul,</HI> had express or∣ders
from <HI>Felix,</HI> the chief officer in the province, <HI>to let
him have liberty, and to forbid none of his acquaintance to
minister, or come unto him;</HI> which must have been a con∣siderable
advantage. And I reckon that <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s con∣finement
at last, when he was <HI>removed to the house he had
lived in before he was bound,</HI> was of the same kind with
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s custody, when he <HI>dwelt</HI> at <HI>Rome in his own
hired house.</HI></P>
<P>§ X. OUR taking in at once the whole story of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s imprisonment has obliged us to pass by a parti∣cular
or two, which the reader will, perhaps, think it
worth while to look back for.</P>
<P>I think it not needful to enquire what St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s right
of appeal was founded in, whether in his citizenship, or
not. I shall only observe, that he does not insist upon
that expressly, but only his innocence, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. 10, 11.
Some learned men have indeed, upon the occasion of
this appeal, cited the words of <HI>Plinie;</HI> in which he tells
<HI>Trajan,</HI> that he had noted down some of those who
were infected with Christianity to be sent to <HI>Rome, be∣cause
they were</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fuerunt alii similis amentiae: quos quia cives Romani erant, annotavi in urbem remittendos. Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cp. 97.</NOTE> <HI>Citizens.</HI> But I cannot perceive to
what purpose these words are alleged here. For if <HI>Plinie</HI>
sent those persons to <HI>Rome,</HI> not for some special reason,
but because his power extended only to the lives of
<HI>Provincials,</HI> and not of Roman Citizens, then his pow∣er
was not at that time equal to that of the Roman Go∣vernours
in <HI>Judea.</HI> It is plain from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI>
was prosecuted by the <HI>Jews</HI> for his life, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. 11. 24,
25. after he was known to be a Roman. And it is as
plain from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that the Roman Governours of <HI>Ju∣dea</HI>
had power over the lives of <HI>Romans. Cumanus</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. a. c. 12. § 2.</NOTE>
put to death a Roman Soldier in <HI>Judea.</HI> And when <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
complains of <HI>Florus</HI>'s crucifying some <HI>Jews</HI> who
<PB N="312" REF="330"/>
were Roman Knights, he would have complained of
somewhat else beside the manner of their death, if <HI>Flo∣rus</HI>
had had no right to pronounce a capital sentence
upon any Roman whatever. And thus I have by the
by, given the evidence of a very material circumstance
in this history, namely, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Festus</HI> had pow∣er
of trying a Roman for life.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Paul</HI>'s appeal to <HI>Cesar</HI> he was in fact sent to
<HI>Rome;</HI> causes were therefore by appeal removed out
of the provinces to <HI>Rome. Suetonius</HI> says, that <HI>Augu∣stus</HI>
appointed a number of Consular persons at <HI>Rome</HI>
to receive the appeals of provincial people, namely one
person to preside over the affairs of each province<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Appellationes quotannis urbanorum quidem litigatorum praetori delegavit: ac provincialium consularibus viris, quos singulos cujusque provinciae negotiis praeposuisset. Vit. August. c. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Luke</HI> says also: <HI>And when it was determined that
we should sail into</HI> Italie, <HI>they delivered</HI> Paul <HI>and certain</HI>
OTHER PRISONERS, <HI>unto one named</HI> Julius, a <HI>Centurion
of</HI> Augustus <HI>band,</HI> Ch. xxvii. 1. It was very common to
send persons from <HI>Judea</HI> to be tried at <HI>Rome. Quinti∣lius
Varus</HI> sent to <HI>Rome</HI> divers of those that had made dis∣turbances
in <HI>Judea</HI> in the interval between <HI>Herod</HI>'s death
and <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s taking possession<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de B. J. l. 2. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE> of the govern∣ment.
<HI>Ummidius Quadratus,</HI> President of <HI>Syria,</HI> sent<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 12. §. 6. &amp; Ant. 20. c. 5. §. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>Ananas</HI> the High Priest and other <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Claudius</HI> to
answer for themselves at <HI>Rome;</HI> as also several of the
most considerable of the <HI>Samaritans. Josephus</HI> says that
“<HI>Felix,</HI> for some slight offense, bound and sent to
<HI>Rome</HI> several priests of his acquaintance, and very
good and honest men, to answer for themselves to<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>in vit. §. 3.</NOTE>
<HI>Cesar.” Felix</HI> also sent to <HI>Rome Eleazar</HI> captain of a
troop of robbers, and several of his men whom he had
taken<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">De Bell. 2. c. 13. §. 2.</NOTE> prisoners.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="331"/>
§ XI. THERE remains but one thing more. <HI>And
when we came to</HI> Rome, <HI>the centurion delivered the priso∣ners
to the</HI> CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: <HI>but</HI> Paul <HI>was
suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him,</HI>
Acts xxviii. 16. Doubtless <HI>Paul</HI> was consigned by <HI>Felix
to the captain of the guard,</HI> as well as the other <HI>prisoners:</HI>
but he was suffered to <HI>dwell by himself,</HI> the rest were
ordered to a more strait confinement. The only thing
we have to observe here is, that the Captain of the
guard often had the custody of prisoners. This appears
from the history, I have given above, of <HI>Agrippa.</HI> And
it seems, that generally the prisoners which were sent
from the provinces were transmitted to this officer, and
not to the Prefect of the City. For so <HI>Trajan</HI> directs
<HI>Plinie,</HI> when he had writ to him for some advice con∣cerning
a particular person whom he had with him in
the province: “That he should send him bound to the
Prefects of his<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Si—vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii mei deet. Plin.
lib. 10. ep. 65.</NOTE> Praetorium:” or in other words
to the Captains of the guard: there being two at that
time, whereas there was but one, when <HI>Paul</HI> was sent
to <HI>Rome. Heliodorus,</HI> the sophist, being in a<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">About A. D. 223.</NOTE> certain
island, fell under a charge of murder. “Whereupon,

thousand men have been employed upon it all this
time. And wilt thou alone rebuild it in three days
time, if it were pulled down and demolished?”</P>
<P>IT ought to be observed here, that <HI>Josephus</HI> has in∣formed
us that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. I. c. 21. ant. 15. c. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, in the eighteenth
year of his reign, made a proposal to the <HI>Jews</HI> of re∣building
the temple. In eight or nine years time He
finished what he intended to do to this sacred place.
But the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were, after this, as it seems,
continually adorning and emproviug the buildings of
the temple.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="333"/>
IT is highly probable, that the term of forty six
years, mentioned here by the <HI>Jews</HI> in their reply to
our Saviour, commences at the time when <HI>Herod</HI> made
his proposal to the <HI>Jews,</HI> or else, at the time when in
pursuance of that proposal he actually set about repair∣ing
the temple.</P>
<P>THERE being some chronological difficulties attend∣ing
the period of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, as well as our Saviour's
ministry, there is between learned men the difference
of two or three years about the exact time when these
words were spoken by the <HI>Jews.</HI> But I have no occa∣sion
at present to concern myself with any of those dif∣ficulties:
because it is easie to shew, that the buildings
of the temple were continued below any of the dates af∣fixed
to this discourse between our Saviour and the
<HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>THE Evidences for this fact are these: <HI>Josephus</HI> re∣lating
affairs which happened in the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> after
the arrival of <HI>Gessius Florus</HI> Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> in the
year of the Christian <HI>Era</HI> 65<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Usser. Ann.</NOTE>, says: “At that time
was the temple finished. The people therefore<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Ant. 20. c. 8. § 7.</NOTE>
seeing the workmen to the number of eighteen thou∣sand
lie idle, and apprehending that they would stand
in need of the wages which they were wont to receive
for working at the temple; and being afraid that
the money, if laid up, should fall into the hands of
the <HI>Romans;</HI> and moreover having a regard to the
workmen, and being willing that the treasures should
be laid out upon them (for if any man worked but
one hour of the day, he presently received his pay)
they petitioned the King<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Agrippa the younger.</NOTE> to rebuild the East Por∣tico.
<PB N="316" REF="334"/>
tico.—It was the work of King <HI>Solomon</HI> who first
built the whole temple. But the King (the charge
and oversight of the temple had been committed to
him by <HI>Claudius Cesar)</HI> considering—that this
would be a work of much time and vast expense, did
not grant their request. However he was not against
paving the city with white marble.”</P>
<P>IT appears from hence, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had continual∣ly
employed men upon the temple: for <HI>Josephus</HI> says,
it was now finished.</P>
<P>IF it be enquired, how they were supplied with mo∣ney
to maintain so many men constantly at work; I
answer, that <HI>Josephus,</HI> in the passage just now transcrib∣ed,
intimates what the fund was, namely, their sacred
treasury. He has more particularly informed us in an∣other
place, where he says; that on the temple were
expended “all the sacred treasures, which were sup∣plied
by tributes sent to God from all parts of the
world<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>de Bell. l. v. c. 5. § 1.</NOTE>.”
Beside the ordinary tribute sent to the
temple, the zeal of the people for this work produced
liberal contributions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>id. Ibid. vid. &amp; Ant. 1. 14. c. 7. § z.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF it be objected that <HI>Josephus,</HI> in the account of
the building of the temple by <HI>Herod,</HI> says, That the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that is, the cloysters and other buildings of the
temple were raised in eight years, and the Naeos or tem∣ple
itself in a year and a half<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 15. c. 11. § 5, 6.</NOTE> that is, in nine years
and a half; I answer, that <HI>Josephus</HI> can mean no more
than that the temple was then fitted for use, or that all
was then finished that <HI>Herod</HI> proposed to do at his cost;
and not the compleating the temple and all the build∣ings
belonging to it. This is evident from the passage
just described at length, in which he says: <HI>At that time
the temple was funished.</HI> And even these words are to be
<PB N="317" REF="335"/>
understood with a limitation. The temple was not
then compleated: there was something still wanting,
which the people would have had done. But they then
put an end to repairing and building, and there was no
more work done at the temple.</P>
<P>IT is possible, that there might be some interruptions
in the works at the temple; but it is likely, they were
very short (if there were any) and such as were not
worth taking notice of in a long period.</P>
<P>§ II. <HI>THE next event I would here confirm from
some foreign testimony, is, the famine said to have hap∣pened
in the reign of</HI> Claudius. And in these days came
prophets from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> unto <HI>Antioch.</HI> And there stood
up one of them named <HI>Agabus;</HI> and signified by the Spirit,
that there should be great dearth throughout all the world,
which came to pass in the days of <HI>Claudius Cesar.</HI> Then
the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined
to send reliese unto the brethren which dwelt in <HI>Judea.</HI>
Which also they did, and sent it to the elders, by the hands
of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> Acts xi. 27—30.</P>
<P>I do not take notice of this famine as the fulfil∣ment
of a prophecy; because I do not enter into that
argument: but only, as a remarkable event which St.
<HI>Luke</HI> assures us happened in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says: <HI>In these days came prophets from</HI> Jeru∣salem
<HI>unto</HI> Antioch. It may be questioned what was
the exact time of the arrival of these prophets to <HI>Antioch,</HI>
and of the delivery of the prophecy. But, I think, it
is easie to perceive from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> when the famine hap∣pened.
It is observable that St. <HI>Luke</HI> having, in the
words just now transcribed from him in the conclusion
of the xith of the <HI>Acts,</HI> given an account of the resolu∣tion
of the church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> and of the commission
given by them to <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> to carry their con∣tributions
to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> proceeds in the xiith chapter to
relate the transactions concerning the church at <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>
during the reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> and also <HI>Herod</HI>'s
death. And then says: <HI>But the word of God grew and
multiplied. And</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul <HI>returned from</HI> Jeru∣salem,
<PB N="318" REF="336"/>
<HI>when they had fulfilled their ministry,</HI> Acts xii,
24, 25.</P>
<P>THERE can be no reason assigned for that interrup∣tion
in the course of the narration, and for the delay to
mention the fulfilment of the commission of the church
of <HI>Antioch,</HI> but this; that the commission was not exe∣cuted,
till the death of <HI>Herod Agrippa.</HI> Moreover, as
the Christians at <HI>Antioch</HI> had a previous knowledge of
this famine, according to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account, before it
happened; it is reasonable to suppose, that the famine
was but then coming on, when <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> ful∣filled
their ministry. <HI>Herod</HI> died in the fourth year of
<HI>Claudius</HI>'s reign, A. D. 44. It is very evident therefore
to me, that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. Usser. Ann. P. J. 4755.</NOTE> the commencement of this famine ought
not to be placed before the latter end of the year 44, or
perhaps, not till the beginning of the year following.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to the proofs of this fact, I
must let the reader know, how I understand it. I think
the dearth prophesied of by <HI>Agabus,</HI> and related by St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> was in <HI>Judea</HI> only. I desire the words themselves
may be considered. There <HI>came prophets to</HI> Jerusalem,
<HI>and one of them signified by the Spirit that there should be
great dearth throughout the whole world,</HI> that is, through∣out
the whole land, the country before mentioned, from
whence these prophets came, namely, the land of <HI>Ju∣dea:</HI>
That there would be a great dearth and scarcity,
not at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> only, which might have been occasion∣ed
by some circumstances peculiar to the city, a siege
or some other accident; but that there would be scarci∣ty,
throughout all the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> by means of a
general failure of the usual produce of the earth.</P>
<P>THE original word [FOR] does sometimes signifie
not the whole world but a particular country only<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>'H <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies the earth: yet the coherence of the words in many places determines the meaning to some particular country. <HI>Josh. ii. 3. They be come to searck out all the country</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Luke iv. 25. <HI>But I tell you of a truth, many w: dows were in</HI> Israel, <HI>when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was through∣out all the land.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Not all the earth, but all the land of <HI>Israel;</HI> that being the country before mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>IN like manner <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies, according to the original nota∣tion of the word the habitable, or rather the inhabited earth: But the connexion of the discourse often restrains the meaning to some par∣ticular country.</HI> Isa. xii. 5. They come from a far country—to destroy the whole land. <HI>In the Septuagint version it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> what goes before and follows shews, that a particular country is in∣tended.</HI> Ver. 1. The burthen of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which Isaiah the son of <HI>Amos</HI> did see. Ver. 19—22. And <HI>BABYLON</HI> the glory of kingdoms, <HI>THE BEAUTY OF THE CHALDEES EXCEELLENCY,</HI> shall be as when God overthrew <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> pitch tent there, neither shall the Shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desart shall shall be there.—And the wild beasts of the Islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces. <HI>I know very well that some understand the destruction of the whole land, in the 5th v. of the whole</HI> Babylonian <HI>Empire. But it is without reason. The whole empire, it is true, would be hereupon dissolved. But any one may perceive that the judgment threatned or foretold is confined properly to the city and province of</HI> Babylon, <HI>the Seat of the Empire, and of the oppressions now to be avenged. Can any one bear the supposition, that the dreadful destruction de∣scribbed in this chapter extended, or was intended to extend to all the parts of the Babylonish Empire?</HI></P>
<P>ST. Luke <HI>has himself used this word in this sense in another place. I think it cannot be disputed:</HI> Luke xxi. 26. Mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; or the land. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>The whole discourse re∣lates to the calamities that were coming, not upon the whole world, or the whole</HI> Roman Empire, <HI>but the land of</HI> Judea, v. 21. Then let them that are in <HI>Judea</HI> flee to the mountains. <HI>Out of</HI> Judea <HI>therefore there would be safety,</HI> v. 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days, for there shall be great distresse in the land, and wrath upon <HI>THIS PEOPLE. And they who should then be in the circumstances just mentioned, would then be particu∣larly unhappy, because they would be unfit for flight.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="337"/>
IT is evident the prophecy was understood by the
disciples at <HI>Antioch,</HI> in whose hearing it was delivered,
to relate to <HI>Judea</HI> only. There is not the lest hint of
any thought of sending relief to any other place, nor
yet of any hesitation in taking the resolution here men∣tioned,
for fear their own circumstances might be ne∣cessitous.</P>
<P>AND when it is added, that in pursuance of their
determination they did actually send relief by the hands
<PB N="320" REF="338"/>
of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> there is not one word bestowed
to enhance the eminence of their charity in assisting
others, when they were in straits themselves, or in im∣mediate
danger of them. And yet it is unlikely this
should have been altogether omitted, if it had been the
case. It is certain, St. <HI>Paul</HI> has placed this circumstance
in the most beautiful manner in the testimony he gives
to the churches of <HI>Macedonia: How that in a great trial
of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep po∣verty,
bad abounded unto the riches of their liberality,</HI>
2 Cor. viii. 2.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that the <HI>Jews</HI> who lived out of
their own country, and all the worshippers of God in
all parts of the world had a special regard ro the peo∣ple
of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Judea:</HI> and were very ready to
contribute to them when under difficulties. Bur a fa∣mine
is a very sore evil; and if the disciples of <HI>Antioch</HI>
had sent a supply to the brethren in <HI>Judea,</HI> when they
were apprehensive of a <HI>great dearth</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> among them∣selves,
such an action would not have been simply rela∣ted
but also commended: at lest this circumstance
would have been taken notice of. It seems to have been
a very general contribution. But so far is there from
being any hint of any straits they were in, that it is
intimated they were in good circumstances: <HI>Every man
according</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>to his ability determined,</HI> &amp;—The phrase
imports an easy and plentiful condition. If the dearth
had reached to <HI>Antioch,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> would not have said:
<HI>every man, according as he abounded:</HI> but would have
been obliged to say: not <HI>regarding his own want or ne∣cessity,</HI>
or the general calamity, or somewhat like it.</P>
<P>I hope no one will do me so much wrong, as to sus∣pect,
that I have attempted to put this meaning on
the words, because I have no proof the famine was uni∣versal.
For I declare, that if I thought the expressions
here used represented an universal dearth; and at the
same time perceived the ancient historians described
<PB N="321" REF="339"/>
only a particular one, I would have acknowledged the
difficulty. But I think the sense, I have here represent∣ed,
is the natural genuine sense of the words. And I
perswade my self the reader is now of the same opini∣on
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>I am not singular in this interpretation. Mr. <HI>Lenfant</HI> under, stands this text in the same manner. And I have had assistance from his notes in composing this article. Since that, I have perceived that Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> was of the same mind. Vid. Annot. in Luc. ii. I.</P>
<P>Two things seem to me to have carried the generality of learned men off from the true meaning of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and to have induced them to suppose, that the famine here spoken of was universal; either all over the world, or at lest the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> One is the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> But this dissiculty, I imagine, I have removed already. The other is, that several ancient historians have spoke of famines in the reign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> at <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> These must be the only reasons for this supposition; for the connexion of the words in St. <HI>Luke</HI> would never lead any man to think the famine was out of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though there is mention made of famines in <HI>Greece,</HI> and at <HI>Rome,</HI> or in <HI>Italie;</HI> this will not prove that there was a general famine. It is evident from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that during the famine in <HI>Judea,</HI> there was plenty in other parts; in <HI>Cyprus, Egypt,</HI> and the territories of King <HI>Izates.</HI> From the two former countries Queen <HI>Helene</HI> procured provisions, and <HI>Izates</HI> sent money to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> which he could not have done, if his own people had been in want.</P>
<P>THE proofs of the famine in <HI>Judea</HI> I transcribe, or refer to in the <HI>Text part.</HI> Of the other famines in this reign there are these accounts. Of the famine in <HI>Greece Eusebius</HI> makes mention in his <HI>Chronicon,</HI> p. 204. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> This famine happened, according to him, in the 9th of <HI>Claudius, A. D.</HI> 49. At <HI>Rome</HI> there were several famines in this reign, one, or more of which are mentioned by <HI>Dio, Suetonius, Tacitus</HI> or <HI>Orosius.</HI> The first happened in the beginning of the reign of this Emperour. But it seems, from the provisions made by him for preventing the like for the future, that it was not owing to a general scarcity at that time, but to the want of a good harbour at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> by which means the city was ill supplied. <HI>Dio's</HI> words are thus: “There being a great famine [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Scarcity,</HI>] He [<HI>Claudius</HI>] not only took care for a present supply, but provided also for the time to come. <HI>Rome</HI> is supplied almost solely with corn imported from abroad, but there being then no good harbour at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> nor any secure stations for ships, the empire of the sea was almost useless to the <HI>Romans.</HI> For except the corn that was brought in the summer time, and laid up in granaries, none was brought thither in the winter: or if any attempted it, it was with the utmost hazard.” Dio lib. 60. p. 671, 672. He then proceeds to describe the great expense which <HI>Claudius</HI> was at in making a good port at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> and a conve∣nient passage from thence up to the City; of which <HI>Suetonius</HI> likewise speaks, <HI>Claud,</HI> cap. 20. <HI>Dio</HI> places this famine in the second year of <HI>Claudius,</HI> A. D. 42. But it must have begun the year before: for there are extant medals struck in each of these years in honour of the Em∣perour, having on their reverse a corn measure with ears of corn hang∣ing over the side. Vid Pagi Critic. in Baron, A. D. 42. n. 7. But I Very much question, whether there was any famine then arising from the failure of crops. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is often used for a famine or scarcity in a city during a fiege, or blockade. And <HI>Dio</HI> proceeding, immediate∣ly after the mention of the famine, to observe the difficulty of coming to <HI>Rome</HI> in the winter, makes me suspect, this scarcity was only a hardship the people were in during the winter for want of sufficient stores and a free passage.</P>
<P>THERE was another famine at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the latter end of this reign, of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> speaks. It is placed by him in the 11th of <HI>Claudius.</HI> A. D. 51. Claudio V. Serv. Cornelio Orfito Coss. Frugum quoque egestas, &amp; orta ex eo fames, in prodigium accipiebatur.

Ann. 12. cap. 43. <HI>Suetonius</HI> also has taken notice of a famine in this reign. He does not say, what year it happened in; but the agreement of circum∣stances shews it to be the same that <HI>Tacitus</HI> speaks of. Anctiore autem annona ob assiduas sterilitates detentus quondam medio foro a tur∣ba, convitiisque ac fimul fragminibus panis ita instratus, ut aegrè nec nisi postico evadere in palatium valuerit: nihil non excogitavit ad inve∣hendos etiam in tempore hiberno commeatus.—&amp; naves mercaturae caussa fabricantibus magna commoda constituit.

<P>I have set down these passages at length. I reckon, I have hereby saved myself the trouble of making many remarks. The <HI>frugum ege∣stas</HI> of <HI>Tatitus,</HI> the <HI>assiduae sterilitates of Suetonius</HI> were in <HI>Italie</HI> only, and these, possibly, not so much owing to bad seasons, as wrong ma∣nagement; as is intimated by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> This was certainly one reason why famines were so common at <HI>Rome.</HI> There is no notice taken by these authors, of scarcities in other places at the same time. The fa∣mine, as described by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> was only in the winter. And when the granaries at <HI>Rome</HI> were almost empty, by the goodnesse of the Gods, and the mildnesse of the winter [modestiâ hiemis] Ships arrived safe with sufficient provisions.</P>
<P>I am not at all sollicitous to prove, that there was no general famine throughout the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI> However, I thought it not amiss to let the reader see how the case seems to me to stand at present. And though some person should hereafter shew, that there was an universal famine some time in this reign; yet that alone would not alter my opinion concerning the meaning of the words of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> who, I think, speaks of nothing beside a <HI>dearth</HI> in <HI>Judea.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="340"/>
SUPPOSING therefore St. <HI>Luke</HI> to have informed us,
that there was in the reign of <HI>Claudius</HI> a great dearth
throughout all the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> I proceed now to
to give some foreign evidence of this event.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="341"/>
<HI>JOSEPHUS,</HI> speaking of <HI>Helens</HI> the Queen of the
<HI>Adiabenes,</HI> has these words: “Her arrival at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
was a great blessing to the people: for the city la∣bouring
at that time under a heavy famine, so that a
great many perishied for want, the Queen sent abroad
several of her officers; some to <HI>Alexandria</HI> for the
purchase of corn, others to <HI>Cyprus</HI> to buy up dried
figs. These having used the utmost expedition, as
soon as they returned, she distributed food to those
that were necessitous. By this liberality she laid a
lasting obligation upon our whole nation. Moreover
her son <HI>Izates</HI> having heard of the famine sent a large
sum of money to the chief men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 20. c. 2. §. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> does afterwards inform us, when this
famine happened. For having mentioned <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI>
(who was sent Procurator into <HI>Judea,</HI> after the death
of <HI>Herod,</HI> in the fourth of <HI>Claudius,</HI> in the latter end of
the year 44.) and his successor <HI>Tiberius Alexander,</HI> he
<PB N="324" REF="342"/>
says: “In their time<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. c. 4. §. 2.</NOTE> a great dearth happened in
<HI>Judea:</HI> when Queen <HI>Helene,</HI> having purchased corn
in <HI>Egypt</HI> with large sums of money, gave it away
amongst the poor, as I have related above.”</P>
<P>So that this famine oppressed the land of <HI>Judea</HI> se∣veral
years. It might begin in the fourth of <HI>Claudius;</HI>
but I think it must have been chiefly in the fifth and
sixth years of his reign.</P>
<P>I apprehend, I have shewn from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that what
St. <HI>Luke</HI> has here related is punctually true. <HI>Josephus</HI>
may be justly supposed to be well acquainted with what
happened at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and in <HI>Judea</HI> in the reign of
<HI>Claudius:</HI> And the whole story of <HI>Izates</HI> and his mother
<HI>Helene</HI> is an affair, he is much pleased with.</P>
<P><HI>EUSEBIUS</HI> likewise mentions this famine in his
Chronicles<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">P. 79, 204.</NOTE>, and in his Ecclesiastical History<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. c. 12.</NOTE>.
He places it in the fourth of <HI>Claudius,</HI> and seems to
have supposed it universal<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Chronic. Can. p. 204.</NOTE> all over the world.</P>
<P><HI>OROSIUS</HI> also speaks of this famine, says it hap∣pened
in the fourth of <HI>Claudius,</HI> and that it oppressed
<HI>Syria.</HI> I place his words in the margin<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Eodem anno (<HI>quarto</HI>) sames gravissima per Sy∣riam facta est, quara etiam prophetae praenuntiaverant. Sed Chri∣stianorum necessitatibut apud Hierosolymam, convectis ab Aegypt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> frumentis, Helena Adiabenorum regina conversa ad fidem Christi lar∣gissime ministravit. lib. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, though he
has committed one great mistake in supposing, that <HI>He∣lene,</HI>
the Queen of the <HI>Adiabenes,</HI> was a Christian.</P>
<P>THOUGH I should take no particular notice of it
here, yet I hope the reader would not omit to observe
the agreement of customs in the sacred writers and <HI>Jo∣sephus.</HI>
The <HI>disciples</HI> at <HI>Antioch</HI> no sooner heard that
there was like to be a dearth in the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> but
they, <HI>every man according to his ability,</HI> some <HI>Jews</HI> by
<PB N="325" REF="343"/>
birth, others Proselytes of righteousnesse, others, possi∣bly,
Proselytes of the gate, <HI>determined to send relief unto
the brethren which dwelt there. Helene,</HI> the Queen of
the <HI>Adiabenes,</HI> and <HI>Izates</HI> her son, both Proselytes to
Judaism, did the same thing.</P>
<P>WE may proceed somewhat farther to observe upon
this occasion, that the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> seem to have ex∣pected
it as due to them, that some particular regard
should be shewed them by the rest of their countrymen,
and by all who came over to the worship of the true
God, and were admitted to share in any of the privileges
of the <HI>jewish</HI> People. Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> assures us: <HI>Only
they would that we should remember the poor, the same which
I also was forward to do,</HI> Gail. ii. 10. The very last<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Unless we suppose (which is the opinion of some very learned and judicious men) that he went thither again, after he had been sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> See in <HI>Miscellanea sacra, the Abstract.</HI> p. 48.</NOTE> time
that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Jerusalem: After many years,</HI> says he,
<HI>I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings,</HI> Acts xxiv.
17. Nor was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s argument a new thought,
though expressed by him with a divine temper: <HI>But now
I go unto</HI> Jerusalem <HI>to minister unto the saints. For it
hath pleased them of</HI> Macedonia <HI>and</HI> Achaia, <HI>to make a
certain contribution for the poor saints which are at</HI> Jerusa∣lem.
<HI>It has Pleased them verily, and</HI> THEIR DEBTORS
<HI>thy are, For if the</HI> Gentiles <HI>have been made partakers
of ther spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them
in carnal things,</HI> Rom. xv. 25—27.</P>
<P>No wonder therefore, that the bigots among the
<HI>Jews</HI> were startled at the thought of any relaxation of
the ancient rigour with which they had treated Prose∣lytes;
and that they laboured, as they did, to main∣tain
their jurisdiction over them. This contention was
not all for the sake of God and the law, but partly for
themselves. Doubtless the outcry of the <HI>Jews</HI> against
St. <HI>Paul,</HI> though very unjust and groundless, was, eve∣ry
word of it expressive and popular, especially at <HI>Je∣rusalem:
This is the man, that teacheth</HI> ALL MEN EVERY

WHERE <HI>against the People, and the Law, and this Place,</HI>
Acts xxi. 28.</P>
<P>§. III. I conclude with the banishment of the <HI>Jews</HI>
from <HI>Rome. After these things,</HI> Paul <HI>departed from</HI> Athens,
<HI>and came to</HI> Corinth. <HI>And found a certain</HI> Jew, <HI>named</HI>
Aquila, <HI>born in</HI> Pontus, <HI>lately come from</HI> Italy, <HI>with his
wife</HI> Priscilla (BECAUSE THAT CLAUDIUS HAD COM∣MANDED
ALL JEWS TO DEPART FROM ROME.)</P>
<P><HI>DIO</HI> says, that <HI>Claudius</HI> did not banish the <HI>Jews</HI>
from <HI>Rome,</HI> but only prohibited their<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. p. 669. B.</NOTE> assemblies.
But <HI>Suetonius,</HI> who lived nearer the time, says: “He
expelled the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> who were continually
raising disturbances, <HI>Chrestus</HI> being their leader<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Judaeos impulsors CHRESTO assidue tumultuantes Roma ex∣pulit.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is disputed by learned men<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Vid. Usser. Ann. P. J. 4767. Witsii Meletemata Leyd. de vit. Paul. §. vii. n. 2, 3.</NOTE>, whether by <HI>Chre∣stus,
Suetonius</HI> means Jesus Christ. I need not concern
my self with that point here. This passage proves what
I bring it for.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has no where particularly mentioned
this event. This edict of <HI>Claudius</HI> seems not to have
been long in force. That may be one reason of this
omission in <HI>Josephus.</HI> Another reason might be, that
it was no agreeable task to him to mention any dis∣graces
cast: upon his people. If some disputes between
the <HI>Jews</HI> and followers of Jesus Christ were really the
cause of this order, that might be another reason;
<HI>Josephus</HI> having been very reserved, if not altogether
silent about the affairs of the Christians.</P>

<P>THE History of the <HI>New Testament</HI> is at∣tended
with many difficulties. <HI>Jewish</HI>
and <HI>Heathen</HI> authors concur with the sa∣cred
Historians in many things. But it is
pretended, that there are other particu∣lars,
in which they are contradicted by
authors of very good note.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="346"/>
AMONG these, the difficulties, which may be very
properly considered in the first place, are those which
relate to the account St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given of the <HI>Taxing</HI>
in <HI>Judea,</HI> which brought <HI>Joseph</HI> and the Virgin to <HI>Beth∣lehem</HI>
a little before the birth of Jesus.</P>
<P>AND it came to passe in those days, <HI>says St.</HI> Luke,
that there went out a decree from <HI>Cesar Augustus,</HI> that all
the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made
when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria</HI>). And all went
to be taxed, every one in his own city. And <HI>Joseph</HI> also
went up from <HI>Galilee,</HI> out of the city of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> into
<HI>Judea,</HI> unto the city of <HI>David,</HI> which is called <HI>Bethlehem</HI>
(because he was of the house and linage of <HI>David</HI>) to be
taxed with <HI>Mary</HI> his espoused wife, being great with childe,
<HI>Luke</HI> ii. 1 - 5.</P>
<P>AGAINST this account several objections have been
raised<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. Spanhem. Dubia Evangelica Part ii. Dub. iv. v. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Huet. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emanst. Evangel. Prop. ix. cap. x. &amp; Commentatores.</NOTE>. They may be all reduced to these three.</P>
<P>I. IT is objected, That there is no mention made in
any ancient <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Historian, of any general
taxing of people all over the world, or the whole <HI>Roman
Empire,</HI> in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> nor of any decree of
the Emperour for that purpose: Whereas, if there had
been then any such thing, it is highly improbable, that
it should have been omitted by them.</P>
<P>II. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. ii. I.] says, that Jesus was born
<HI>in the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king. Judea</HI> therefore was not
at that time a Roman province, and there could not be
any <HI>taxing</HI> made there by a decree of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>CYRENIUS</HI> was not Governour of <HI>Syria</HI>
till nine or ten, perhaps twelve years after the birth of
Jesus. St. <HI>Luke</HI> therefore was mistaken, in saying, that
this taxing was made in his time. This objection will
be stated more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>§. I. BY way of answer to the first objection.</P>
<P>1. I allow that there is not any mention made by an∣cient
writers of any general taxing all over the world,
or of all the subjects of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> in the reign
of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>

MANY learned men having been of a different opi∣nion,
I am obliged to consider their proofs.</P>
<P><HI>TILLEMONT</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tillemont Memoires Eccles. Tom. i. Not. ii. Sur <HI>Jesas Christ.</HI></NOTE> puts the question (for he does
not assert it) whether <HI>Plinie</HI> has not referred to such a
thing. But it is plain from <HI>Plinie</HI>'s words, that he speaks
of a partition of <HI>Italie</HI> only into several districts<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Nunc ambitum ejus, urbesque enumerabimus. Qua in re prae∣sari necessarium est, auctorem nos Divum Augustum secuturos, de∣scriptionemque ab eo factam Italiae totius in regiones xi. Plin. lib. iii. cap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a passage also of <HI>Dio,</HI> which has been re∣ferred
to upon this occasion: But it has evidently no
relation to the matter before us. The <HI>Romans</HI> had a
tax called the <HI>twentieth.</HI> This tax was grievous to ma∣ny
people, <HI>Augustus</HI> therefore desired the senate to con∣sider
of some other. “But the senate not finding any
proper expedient, he intimated that he would raise
money upon lands and houses, without telling them
what, or in what manner, it should be; and here∣upon
sent officers abroad, some one way and some
another, to make a survey of the estates both of par∣ticular
persons and cities. But upon this the senate
complied immediately, and the old tax of the twen∣tieth
was confirmed, lest a worse thing should come
in its room. This was all <HI>Augustus</HI> aimed at, and
the survey was laid aside<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. l. 56. p. 588. E.</NOTE>.”' Besides, this affair
happened, A. U. 766. A. D. 13. long after the taxing
which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of.</P>
<P>THE passage, which <HI>Baronius</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Apparat. N. 97.</NOTE> has quoted from
<HI>Aethicus,</HI> he does himself allow to relate only to a geo∣metrical
description of the empire, begun by order of
<HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> and finished in thirty two years, and there∣fore
over long before the <HI>taxing</HI> mentioned by St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>I am afraid to mention his argument from <HI>Plinei,</HI>
lest it should be thought, that I intend to, divert the
<PB N="330" REF="348"/>
reader, when we ought to be serious. <HI>Plinie</HI> says:
“And as for <HI>Angustus</HI> himself, whom all mankind rank
in this classe [<HI>of fortunate persons</HI>] if the whole course
of his life be carefully considered, there will be ob∣served
in it many instances of the ficklenesse and in∣constance
of human affairs<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">In Divo quoque Augusto, quem universa mortalitas in HAC CENSURA nuncupat, si diligenter aestimentur cundta, magna sortis humanae reperiantur volumina. Lib. vii. cap. 45.</NOTE>.” But <HI>Baronius</HI> sup∣poses,
that <HI>Plinie</HI> says, that <HI>in every census mention is
made of</HI> Augustus, <HI>and that there was so particularly in
that made by</HI> Vespasian <HI>and</HI> Titus, <HI>because he first made</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idemque dum haec alibi ait: [lib. vii. cap. 45.] In Divo quoque Augusto, quem universa mortalitas in hac censura nuncupat, nempe eam, quam Vespasianus &amp; Titus recens egerunt, de qua idem inferius [ibid. cap. 49.] Meminit, significare videtur, in quolibet repetito in orbe Romano lustris singulis censu, mentionem Augusti fieri; quod primus omnium universum orbem Romanum subjectum imperio cen∣suisset. At de censibus satis. Baron, ubi supra.</NOTE>
<HI>a survey of the whole Roman Empire:</HI> Thus making
<HI>Plinie</HI> to refer, in the passage he quotes from him, not
to what went before, but to a passage which follows
<HI>four</HI> chapters lower.</P>
<P>SOME have alleged, as a proof of this general tax∣ing,
some words of <HI>Suidas,</HI> who in his <HI>Lexicon</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In Voc. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> says,
“That <HI>Augustus</HI> sent out twenty men of great probity,
into all parts of his empire, by whom he made an as∣sessement
of persons and estates, ordering a certain
quota to be paid into the treasury. This was the first
census, they who were before him having at pleasure
exacted tribute of those who had any thing; so that
it was a public crime to be rich.”</P>
<P>BUT it is difficult to take this upon <HI>Suidas</HI>'s autho∣rity
alone, since he says not in what part of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s
reign it was done, quotes no author for it, and it is not
<PB N="331" REF="349"/>
to be found in any ancient writer now extant. Though
possibly, he refers to the story just now told from
<HI>Dio;</HI> who assures us, that project, he mentions, was
never executed. Besides <HI>Suidas</HI> says, this was the <HI>first
Census;</HI> which is a very great mistake. There had
been before <HI>Augustus</HI> many assessements of Roman ci∣tizens,
and likewise of divers provinces of the <HI>Roman
Empire.</HI></P>
<P>IN another place <HI>Suidas</HI> says; “<HI>Augustus</HI> had a de∣sire
to know the number of all the inhabitants of the
<HI>Roman Empire</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">V.<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>.” And he mentions the number,
which, he says, was found upon the enquiry. But <HI>Sui∣das</HI>
must have been mistaken. Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI>'s re∣mark
upon this passage is worth placing here. “In their
Consulship [<HI>Caius Marcius Censorinus,</HI> and <HI>C. Asinius
Gallus</HI>] there was a second muster made at <HI>Rome,</HI> in
which were numbered 4233000 Roman Citizens, as
is gathered out of the fragments of the <HI>Ancyran</HI> mar∣ble.
In <HI>Suidas,</HI> in A <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the number is far lesse of
those that were mustered, 4101017, which yet he
very ridiculously obtrudeth upon us not for the mu∣ster
of the city only but of the world<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Annals: year of the world, 3996. p. 786. <HI>Engl. Edit. Lond.</HI> 1658. In the <HI>Latin</HI> the last words are: Qui∣tamen non pro Urbis tantùm sed pro Orbis etiam Romani censu ridiculè nobis ibi obtruditur.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE late learned editor<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De hoc loco vide omnino Casaubonum contra Baron. Exerc. 1. Num. 93. Et Usser.—qui recte observarunt, Suidam hic censum urbis pro censu orbis Romani lectori obtrudere: cum ridiculum sit credere, non plures fuisse totius impe∣rii Romani incolas, quam quot Suidas hie exprimit.</NOTE> of <HI>Suidas</HI> does also
highly approve of this censure passed upon his author
by our most learned and excellent Archbishop. It is
observable, that they both use here the word <HI>Cily [urbis
censu</HI>]. I hope however they mean not the City of <HI>Rome</HI>
only and the conntry round about it, but the Roman
Citizens all over the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> or at lest all <HI>Italie:</HI>
<PB N="332" REF="350"/>
for otherwise, with submission, I should think them, in
this particular, almost as unreasonable as <HI>Suidas.</HI> It is
incredible, that there should have been at <HI>Rome</HI> and in
the country round about it, beside strangers and slaves,
which were very numerous, so many Roman Citizens
as are mentioned on the <HI>Ancyran</HI> Marble; even though
all, who were entred in a census, be set down there;
which however is denied by some. I suppose then, that
by the Muster of the City, these learned men mean the
muster or census of Roman Citizens in any part of the
<HI>Roman Empire;</HI> as opposed to all the people in general,
living in the same Empire. And in this sense only<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">I think this evidently <HI>Kuster</HI>'s sense. His <HI>Orbis Romani</HI> is ex∣plianed afterwrads by <HI>totius imperii Romani Incolas.</HI> Therefore his <HI>Orbis census</HI> imports Roman Citizens living any where.</NOTE>
I adopt their censure of <HI>Suidas:</HI> and cannot but think it
very just. The number of the inhabitants of the <HI>Roman
Empire</HI> must needs have exceeded the numbers mention∣ed
by <HI>Suidas,</HI> or on the marble; though it should be
supposed, that none are included in these numbers, but
those who were arrived at military age. This might
be sufficient to shew, that the number of the An∣cyran
Marble is not the number of all the people
of the <HI>Roman Empire:</HI> but other reasons will appear
presently.</P>
<P>I must in the next place take the liberty of consider∣ing
what Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> has said upon this subject, who
with <HI>Huet</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Demon. Evang. ubi supra §. iii.</NOTE>, and others, thinks, that this description
or survey in <HI>Judea</HI> belonged to one of the surveys made
by <HI>Augustus;</HI> and that in particular, it was a part of
his <HI>second</HI> Census. “The first Was in the year when he
himself was the sixth time, and <HI>M. Agrippa</HI> the se∣cond
time Consuls, that is, in the year before the
Christian Aera 28. The second time in the Consul∣ship
of <HI>C. Marcius Censorinus</HI> and <HI>C. Asinius Gallus,</HI>
that is, in the year before the Christian Aera 8. And
the last time in the Consulship of <HI>Sextus Pompeius Ne∣pos,</HI>
that is, in the year of the Christian Aera 14. In
<PB N="333" REF="351"/>
the first and last time he executed this with the assi∣stance
of a Collegue. But the second time he did it
by himself alone, and this is the description which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> refers to. The Decree concerning it was is∣sued
out the year I have mentioned, that is, in the
8th year of the Christian Aera, which was three years
before that in which Christ was born.—That we
allow three years for the execution of this decree, can
give no just reason for exception.—The account
taken by the decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> at the time of our
Saviour's birth extended to all manner of persons,
and also to their possessions, estates, qualities, and
other circumstances. And when a description and
survey like this was ordered by <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣ror,
to be taken for <HI>England</HI> only, I mean that of
the <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book, it was six years in making; and
the Roman province of <HI>Syria</HI> was much more than
twice as big as all <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Prideaux Conn. Part, ii. pag. 650, 652. 8<HI>vo.</HI> Edit. 1718.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>TO all this I shall only say (I.) That the surveys
made by <HI>Augustus</HI> were of ROMAN CITIZENS only. So
he says himself in the inscription on the Ancyran mar∣ble
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Et in Consulatu. Sexto. Censum. POPULI. Collega. M. A∣grippa. Egi—Quo. Lustro CIVIUM. ROMANORUM. Censita sunt. Ca∣pita. Quadragiens. Centum. Millia. Et. Sexaginta.

thing<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Recepit &amp; morum legumque regimen aeque perpetuum: quo jure, quamquam fine censurae honore, censum tamen POPULI ter egit. <HI>Suet.</HI> in <HI>Aug.</HI> c. 27.</NOTE>. But the Census or Description made in <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
according to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account, was of all the <HI>In∣habitants</HI>
of that country, which certainly were not, all
of them, Roman Citizens.</P>
<P>(2.) THE years which the Doctor mentions were not
the years, in which the decrees were issued out, but in
which the surveys was finished. This appears to me
<PB N="334" REF="352"/>
the most natural meaning of the words of the inscrip∣tion.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be objected, that the consulships
here set down do not denote the years, in which a cen∣sus
was finished, but in which it was resolved upon and
entered in the <HI>Fasti,</HI> or Public Acts; and that the sense
of the inscription may be thus: In such, and such a
Consulship I made a census, by which census when fi∣nished,
the number of Citizens was found to be so and
so. It may be likewise said, that the phrase <HI>Lustrum
feci</HI> does not necessarily import the making the <HI>Lustrum,</HI>
which was done when the census was over, but that <HI>Lu∣strum</HI>
is <HI>here</HI> synonymous with census. And it may be
urged, that when <HI>Lustrum</HI> denotes the solemn sacrifice
at the conclusion of the census, the verb <HI>condo</HI> is used,
and not <HI>facio,</HI> which we have here.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that by the account here given of
the <HI>third</HI> census we are obliged to suppose, that the Con∣sulships
here named denote the times, when each cen∣sus
was finished. <HI>Sextus Pompeius</HI> and <HI>Sextus Apuleius,</HI>
in whose Consulship the last census is placed, were Con∣suls,
A. U. 767, A. D. 14. And <HI>Augustus</HI> died the 19th
of <HI>August</HI> that very same year. If the census had been
only begun, and not finished, he could not have set
down on the Table, as he has done, the number of Ci∣tizens
which was found in that census: Moreover, it is
plain from<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">A Germania in urbem post biennium regressus, triumphum, quem distulerat, egit.—Dedicavit &amp; concordiae aedem.—Ac non multo post lege per Coss. lata, ut provincias cum Augusto communi∣ter administraret, simulque censum ageret, condito lustro in Illyricum profectus est. vit. Tiber. c. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>Suetonius,</HI> that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was nominated
for Collegue of <HI>Augustus</HI> in this census, the year before,
if not sooner. It is likely the census might be <HI>then</HI> en∣tered
in the public Acts. But however that be, it is
plain, that the date on the Ancyran Marble signifies
the compleating of the census. And I think, that the
passage I have just quoted from <HI>Suetonius</HI> may remove
the scruple relating to the phrase; since he has used the
<PB N="335" REF="353"/>
verb <HI>condb,</HI> by which we are fully assured, that the cen∣sus
was finished, and the solemn sacrifice performed at
the conclusion of it, in the year set down on the Ancy∣ran
Marble.</P>
<P>FARTHER, <HI>Augustus</HI> in the Ancyran Marble places
his first census in his own sixth Consulship, <HI>Agrippa</HI> be∣ing
his collegue. And <HI>Dio</HI> says expressly that <HI>Augustus</HI>
made, or <HI>finished</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> l. 53. p. 496. c.</NOTE> the census in that year. This be∣ing
the case as to the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>third</HI> census of <HI>Augustus,</HI>
we may conclude the same thing also with reference to
the <HI>second,</HI> and that it was finished the <HI>eighth</HI> year be∣fore
the Christian Aera: consequently, it is impossible,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s description should have been a part of it.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Augustus</HI>'s death there were three books
found among his papers: and one of these is alleged as
a proof, that there had been made some general survey
of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> and that about this time. Dr.
<HI>Prideaux</HI>'s words are these: “Of the book, which <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>

<P>BUT I do not see how <HI>Augustus</HI>'s having had by him
a <HI>little book (libellum, Breviarium imperii</HI>) written with
his own hand, containing a small abridgement of the
public taxes, imposts, and revenues, can be any proof
<PB N="336" REF="354"/>
that this state of the empire was formed upon a survey
made at this time, or indeed, upon any general sur∣vey
made at any other time, by virtue of any one sin∣gle
decree (that is St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s phrase) for the whole em∣pire.
This state which <HI>Augustus</HI> had by him of the pub∣lic
strength and riches might have been formed upon
surveys made at different times. Nay, he might have
in this <HI>Book</HI> the state of dependent Kingdomes, in some
of which a census had never been made. And it is like∣ly
it may appear in the progresse of this argument, that
there were several countries, branches of the <HI>Roman
Empire,</HI> which had never been obliged to a census.</P>
<P>BESIDE that there is not found in any ancient Ro∣man
historian any account of a general census of all the
countries and people of the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> there are
considerations taken from the nature of the thing, which
render it very improbable, that a general census should
ever have been appointed at one time. The Roman
assessements were always disagreeable things in the pro∣vinces,
and often caused disturbances. An universal
census at the same time seems to have been impractica∣ble.
And there does not appear in any Roman historian
so much as a hint, that such a thing was ever thought
of by any of their Emperors.</P>
<P>WHAT is just now said of the difficulty of making a
general survey at one and the same time, affects chiefly
the Doctor's sentiment, who seems to think that the
taxing St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of was a proper Roman census.
They who suppose that it was only a numbring of the
people, are not particularly concerned with it.</P>
<P>2. I AM of opinion, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks only of a
<HI>taxing</HI> in <HI>Judea:</HI> and that the first verse of his se∣cond
chapter ought to be rendered after this manner:
<HI>And it came to pass in those days, that there went forth a
decree from</HI> Cesar Augustus <HI>that all the</HI> land <HI>should be
taxed.</HI> So Mr. <HI>Lenfant</HI> has translated it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">En ce temps là, il fût publié un Edit de la part de Cásar Auguste, pour faire un dénombrement de tout le pais. <HI>Nouveau. Test.</HI> voyez les notes.</NOTE>. <HI>Bynaeus</HI>

rendered the whole world or the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> Let
us see what St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, omitting at present the pa∣renthesis.
<HI>And it came to passe in those days, that there went
cut a decree from</HI> Cesar Augustus, <HI>that all the world should
be taxed. And all went to be taxed, every one in his own
city. And</HI> Joseph <HI>also went up from</HI> Galilee <HI>out of the city
of</HI> Nazareth. If the account of the Decree had been
worded by St. <HI>Luke</HI> so generally as to comprehend the
whole world, would he not have taken some notice of
the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> before he came to relate particularly
what was done in it?</P>
<P>IF it be enquired: If the land of <HI>Judea</HI> only be meant,
what does the term <HI>all</HI> signifie? I answer, it was very
necessary to be added. At the time when St. <HI>Luke</HI>
wrote, and indeed from the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> which hap∣pened
soon after the nativity of Jesus, the land of <HI>Judea</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="356"/>
or of <HI>Israel</HI> had suffered a dismembring. <HI>Archelaus</HI> had
to his share <HI>Judea</HI> properly so called, together with <HI>Sa∣maria</HI>
and <HI>Idumea.</HI> And the province of <HI>Judea,</HI> which
was afterwards governed by Roman Procurators, was
pretty much of the same extent. But <HI>Galilee, I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urea,</HI>
and other parts of the land of <HI>Israel,</HI> had been given to
other descendents of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words therefore are extremely proper and
expressive, that ALL THE LAND <HI>should be taxed;</HI> to
shew, that this decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> comprehended <HI>Gali∣lee,</HI>
the country in which <HI>Joseph</HI> lived. That this was
the intention in adding this term of universality, is evi∣dent
from St. <HI>Luke's</HI> specifying immediately afterwards
the name of the city, from which <HI>Joseph</HI> came to <HI>Bethle∣hem;</HI>
which city was not in the country that originally
belonged to the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> was not situated in the
bounds of the province of <HI>Judea</HI> at the time in which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> is supposed to write, but was of the kingdoms
of <HI>Judea</HI> in the reign of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>IT seems needlesse to observe, that it was very com∣mon
to add the term <HI>all</HI> or <HI>whole</HI> to <HI>Judea</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI>
when persons intended the land of the <HI>Israelites.</HI> There
are divers instances in the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testament.</HI> And
<HI>Josephus,</HI> speaking of <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Elder, who had been
possessed of all the territories subject to his grandfather
<HI>Herod</HI> the Great, says: “He had now reigned three
years over the WHOLE land of <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. pag. 871. v. 34.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THOUGH I am very well satisfied from the context,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> comprehends nothing in <HI>Augustus</HI>'s decree
beside the land of <HI>Judea;</HI> yet it is no small confirmati∣on
of this interpretation, that the most early Christian
writers seem to have understood St. <HI>Luke</HI> in the same
manner. For when they speak of this circumstance
of our Saviour's nativity, they never say any thing
of a general census all over the world, or the <HI>Roman
Empire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="357"/>
<HI>JUSTIN MARTYR</HI> in his first apology informs
the Emperour and the Senate, of the time and place of
Christ's nativity. “<HI>Bethlehem, says he,</HI> in which Jesus
Christ was born, is a village in the country of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> at the distance of five and thirty stadia from
<HI>Jerusalem.</HI> You may assure your-selves of this from

manner<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. p. 83. B. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dial. ii. p. 303. D.</NOTE>. I do not recollect above one passage of
<HI>Irenaeus,</HI> in which there is any notice taken of this
census<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sed proxima aetatis dicebant, [<HI>Judaei John</HI> viii. 56, 57.] five verè scientes ex conscriptione census, five conjicientes secundum ae∣tatem, quam videbant habere eum super quadraginta. Iren. lib. ii. cap. xxii. §. 6.</NOTE>, and that is not very material.</P>

beside that in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>IF any think that we are to expect no mention of a
general census from the Christian Writers, because the
census <HI>Judea</HI> was all that was to their purpose: I say,
that a general census of all the people and countries of
the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> was very much to their purpose, the
more to illustrate the epocha of our Saviour's nativity.
A general census must have been better known than one
that was particular. Would <HI>Justin Martyr, Origen,</HI>
and <HI>Tertullian</HI> have omitted this circumstance, if St. <HI>Luke</HI>
had mentioned it? or if they themselves were aware of
it? And yet in their time certainly an universal census,
made in the reign of <HI>Augustus,</HI> could not have been for∣gotten.</P>
<P>NAY, though the universality of the census had been
a circumstance of no importance at all in their argu∣ment;
yet it is almost impossble, but it must have
dropped from them in some one of those many occa∣sions,
in which they have mentioned our Saviour's na∣tivity,
and the census which accompanied it.</P>
<P>I SHALL proceed but one step farther to observe,
that <HI>Eusebius</HI> has made no mention of any more than the
census performed in <HI>Judea,</HI> neither in his History<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ecc. lib. I. cap. 5.</NOTE>
nor in his Chronicle<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> &amp; p. 200.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="359"/>
I CANNOT say, that this interpretation is supported
by any ancient version. But <HI>Bynaeus</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoc a nemine interpretum, quod quidem ego sciam, animad∣versum esse nisi in specimine Glossae Ordinariae, quod Robertus Ste∣phanus edidit, legimus. <HI>Octavius</HI> xlii. <HI>imperii sui anno, publico decreto edixit, ut universus orbis Judae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum &amp; Syriae describeretur, &amp; paulo post, ut censeretur totus orbis] sive describtretur: non quidem orbis ter∣rarum, sed orbis Judaeorum &amp; Syriat.</HI> Bynaeus.

in an ancient gloss there is this explanation of it: <HI>That
all the world should be taxed] or survyed: not the orb of
all the earth, but the orb of</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Syria.</P>
<P>IF then the census or description ordered by the de∣cree
of <HI>Augustus</HI> at the time of our Saviour's nativity
was of the land of <HI>Judea</HI> only, the silence of ancient hi∣storians
is no objection at all against St. <HI>Luke's</HI> account.
There must have been many surveys of provinces of the
<HI>Roman Empire</HI> in the reign of <HI>Augustus,</HI> of which there
is no notice taken by any of the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> authors
now in our hands.</P>
<P>THE only writer, in whom we could expect any men∣tion
of it, is <HI>Josephus.</HI> Whether he has spoke of it or not,
will be considered hereafter. But supposing at present,
that there is no notice at all taken of it by him, this is
no objection against St. <HI>Luke.</HI> It is not to be expected
we should find in one single Historian all the affairs that
were transacted in his country. We have undoubted
evidence of this enrollement in the early testimonies of
the Christian writers. I have already exhibited more
than enough of them. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> speaks of it in his
<HI>apology</HI> to the Emperour and the Senate before the mid∣dle
of the second century, <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions it in se∣veral
of his pieces. There is scarce any one occasional
fact or circumstance relating to the history of Jesus,
which was more frequently and more publickly men∣tioned
by the Christian writers. And yet it was never
contested, that I know of, in all antiquity, not even by
the adversaries of the Christian Religion. <HI>Julian</HI> speaks
of it as a thing universally known. I subjoyn his words.
“The Jesus, <HI>says he,</HI> whom you extol, was one of <HI>Ce∣sar's</HI>
<PB N="342" REF="360"/>
subjects. If you make a doubt of it, I will prove
it by and by. Though it may be as well done now.
For you say your-selves that he was enrolled with his
father and mother in the time of <HI>Cyreniuss</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Apud Cyril. l. vi. p. 213. ed. Spanh.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I PRESUME, I have answered this objection: but it
is upon the supposition that St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of a census
or enrollment in <HI>Judea</HI> only. I have not taken up this
interpretation to avoid a difficulty, but because I real∣ly
think it to be St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s meaning. However, if
St. <HI>Luke</HI> be supposed to speak of a general census of the
<HI>Roman Empire,</HI> I own it, that the silence of antiquity
would be a very great objection. Nor is the difficulty
much lessened by supposing this enrollement was of per∣sons
only, and not of lands or goods. The numbring
the people was far from being the principal design of a
census of Roman Citizens. But yet, oftentimes, when
an historian mentions a census, he gives very little ac∣count
of any thing relating to it, beside the number of
Citizens that was found. If ever the number of all the
people of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> had been taken in the reign
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> it would have been a very great curiosity;
and historians would have been very fond of gratifying
their readers with it. Though we have but few wri∣ters
of those times, yet it is with me unquestionable,
that in some of those we have, there would have been
a particular account of so remarkable an event, or
at lest many references to it: whereas there are none
at all.</P>
<P>§. II. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> says, that Jesus was born in the
days of <HI>Herod. Judea</HI> therefore was not at that time
a Roman Province: and there could be no taxing made
there by virtue of a Decree of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>THIS objection has been answered already. For it
is evident from what has been alleged from the Chri∣stian
writers in the reply to the former objection, that
<PB N="343" REF="361"/>
there was some census, description, or survey made in
<HI>Judea</HI> at the time of our Saviour's nativity, by a de∣cree
of <HI>Augustus.</HI> However, that no scruples may re∣main
in the minds of any from a false notion of the state
of <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Herod,</HI> I slall particularly consider the
matter of this second objection.</P>
<P>BUT I would first observe in general; that though
we have the word <HI>Taxing</HI> in our version, <HI>that all the
world should be taxed; This taxing was first made;</HI> yet
the words used by St. <HI>Luke</HI> do not import a tax, or lay∣ing
a tax or duty upon a people. In the margin of our
Bibles we have the word <HI>enrolled.</HI> And in most other
translations<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ut describeretur universus orbis. Haec descriptio prima facta est: Vers. vulg. pour faire un denombrement—ce denombrement se fit. Mons vers. M. Le Clerc., Lensant, &amp;c.</NOTE> a word of like signification is used.</P>
<P>I MUST also premise, that some have thought that
this enrolment was to be only of names and persons;
and that all <HI>Augustus</HI> aimed at by this decree was to
know the number of people inhabiting the <HI>Roman Em∣pire,</HI>
with their employments and conditions of life.
Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> paraphrases these words thus: <HI>That all the
world should be taxed: i. e.</HI> “should have their names
and conditions of life, set down in court rolls, ac∣cording
to their families.”</P>
<P>OTHERS have thought, that this decree obliged to
a registry not only of the names of persons and their
conditions of life, but also of their goods and possessi∣ons;
and that in short, it was a Roman census which
was now made, in order to the peoples paying taxes
for the future, according to the value of their estates.
I own, I am inclined to this latter opinion; and that
St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks only of a census in <HI>Judea,</HI> as I have
already declared.</P>
<P>HAVING premised these things, that we may find
out what kind of <HI>enrolment,</HI> or registring was now or∣dered
by <HI>Augustus;</HI> whether a decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> could
be obligatory at this time upon the people of <HI>Judea;</HI>
and whether it is likely there was a Roman, census made
<PB N="344" REF="362"/>
there at this time; I shall consider these following par∣ticulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I SHALL explain the nature of a Roman census.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I SHALL consider the force of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I SHALL describe in general the state of <HI>Judea</HI>
under <HI>Herod.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. I SHALL enquire what grounds there are to be∣lieve,
that a Roman census was made in <HI>Judea</HI> at this
time.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. I SHALL explain the nature of a Roman census.
A census (as I take it) consisted of these two parts: <HI>first,</HI>
the account which the people gave in of themselves and
their estates; and <HI>secondly,</HI> the value set upon their estates
by the censors, who took: the account from them. The
people did undoubtedly represent in some measure the
value of the things they entered; but the Censors seem
to have had the power of determining and setling the
value.</P>
<P>THERE was indeed another thing which belonged to
the office of the Censors at <HI>Rome,</HI> sc. the censure or cor∣rection
of manners: but, as I suppose that belonged on∣ly
to a census of Roman Citizens, and that it was no
part of a census of all the inhabitants of a province, or
of a country subject to a dependent Prince, I take no
notice of it here.</P>
<P>THE Roman census was an institution of <HI>Servius Tul∣lius,</HI>
the sixth King of <HI>Rome. Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Hallicarnas∣sus</HI>
gives us this account of it; that “He ordered all
the Citizens of <HI>Rome</HI> to register their estates accord∣ing
to their value in money, taking an oath, in a
form he prescribed, to deliver a faithful account ac∣cording
to the best of their knowledge, specifying
withal the name of their parents, their own age, and
the names of their wives and children, adding also
what quarter of the City, or what town in the coun∣try,
they lived in<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dionys. Hal. Ant. Rom. L. iv. c. 15. p. 212. init. Huds. Edit.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="363"/>
AND after much the same manner do we find a Ro∣man
census described in the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Censores populi civitates, soboles, familias, pecuniasque censento. Cic. He Leg. <HI>lib.</HI> iii. cap. 3.</NOTE> Fragments of the Twelve
Tables, and in the Roman<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Jam (ut censoriae tabulae loquuntur) fabrüm &amp; procüm, audeo dicere, non fabrorum &amp; procorum. Cic.

people were required to give in an account of their
names, their quality, employments, wives, children,
servants and estates.</P>
<P>BESIDE what the people did, there seems to have
been something done by the Censors more than the bare
taking the account the people gave in: That is, they
were to determine the value of each particular of their
estates, and the amount<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In censu habendo po∣testas omnis aestimationis habendae, summaeque faciundae censori per∣mittitur. Cic. in Verr. lib. ii. n. 131.</NOTE> of the whole; and from this
seems to have been taken the name or title of this office,
both in the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Censio aestimatio, unde Censores. Festus de verb. Sign. Censores ab re appellati sunt. Liv. lib. iv. cap. 8. sin.</NOTE> <HI>Latin,</HI> and in the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Greek</HI> language. For
not only was the compasse of ground which any one pos∣sessed
to be considered, but the nature of it, and the pro∣fits
it might yield: Nor the number only of slaves or ser∣vants,
which any one had; but also the work<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In servis deferendis observandum est, ut &amp; nationes eorum, &amp; officia, &amp; artificia specialiter deferantur. l. iv. §. 5. ff. de censibus.</NOTE> they
were employed in, according to which their service was
to be valued. And therefore every one reckoned him∣self
worth so<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Censores dicti, quod rem fuam quisque tanti aestimare solitus sit, quantum illi censuerint. Festus. V. Censores.</NOTE> much as the Censors valued his estate at.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="364"/>
THIS power, which the Censors had of rating or
valuing the estates of all persons, gave them an oppor∣tunity
of committing injustice, in favouring some and
oppressing others. For though there were<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Formâ censuali cavetur, ut agri sic in censum referantur,—arvum quod in decem annos proximos satum erit, quot jugerum sit,—illam aequitatem debet admittere censitor, ut officio ejas congruat, re∣levari eum, qui in publicis tabulis delato modo frui certis ex causis non possit. l. 4. pr. eod.</NOTE> rules, by

<P>THAT the reader may have a compleat idea of the
design of these enrolments among the <HI>Romans,</HI> at lest
so far as is necessary to our purpose; I shall add here
the account which <HI>Dionysius</HI> has given of the census
made by <HI>Laertius</HI> the Dictator, A. U. 258. before
Christ, 496. Being chosen Dictator, “He immediate∣ly
ordered, that all, according to the excellent insti∣tution
of <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> should in their several tribes
give in an account of their estates, setting down the
names of their wives and children, and their own age
and that of their children. All having in a short time
offered themselves to be assessed (for the penalty of
neglect was no less than forfeiture of estate and citi∣zenship)
there were found to be one hundred fifty
thousand and seven hundred <HI>Romans</HI> at man's estate.
After this, he separated those who were of military
age from the elder; and disposing those into centu∣ries,
he formed four bodies of horse and<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> lib. 5. c. 75. p. 324.</NOTE> foot.”
<PB N="347" REF="365"/>
From this passage it appears, that the knowledge of the
military strength of the state was intended in this institu∣tion,
as well as the regulating the public revenue. It
was necessary to observe this here, that the reader may
the better judge of some arguments that follow.</P>
<P>2. WE shall now consider the force and import of
the words St. <HI>Luke</HI> makes use of in his account of the
matter before us.</P>
<P>Now it must be allowed, that the verb made use of
by St. <HI>Luke</HI> in the first verse, <HI>that all should be taxed</HI> or
enrolled<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, is used by <HI>Greek</HI> authors, for the making
any kind of entry or enrolment. Thus <HI>Servius Tullius</HI>
observing many Roman Citizens to be in debt, ordered
all of them who had not where-withal to satisfie their
creditors to enter<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dionys. Hal. L. iv. c. 10. p. 207.</NOTE> their names and the sum they
owed in public rolls, that it might be known what the
whole amounted to, and provision might be made for
payment.</P>
<P>THIS word is likewise used concerning the enrol∣ments
which were made, when the Roman Citizens
gave in their names and inlisted themselves in the
service of a General<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dion. Hal. Lib. x. cap. 16. init.</NOTE></P>
<P>So that perhaps there may be some reason to que∣stion,
whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> intended not a bare entry or
enrolment made by the people of <HI>Judea,</HI> of their names
and condition of life, as many learned men have sup∣posed.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="366"/>
BUT yet on the other hand, it is certain, that the
whole of a census is oftentimes expressed by the <HI>Greek</HI>
authors, by the words which St. <HI>Luke</HI> has used. Thus
<HI>Dio Cassius</HI> speaking of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s first census, says, “in
the same year he finished<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. L. 53. p. 496. c. ad A. U. C. 726.—vid. etiam p. 512. B <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (sc. Gallorum) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> the enrolments.” Here∣by
meaning, the whole of a census, including also the
censure of manners, which belonged to a census of Ro∣man
Citizens. And in another place, when he parti∣cularly
describes the office of a Censor, he says: “As
Censors, they [<HI>the Emperours</HI>] enquire<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. L. 53. P. 508. B. C.</NOTE> into our
lives and manners and make enrolments.” He intends
therefore in this place the whole of a census, except the
correction of manners, by the noun, which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
makes use of in the second verse: only it is in the plu∣ral
number.</P>
<P>FARTHER St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s narration contains in it so ma∣ny
circumstances of a Roman census, that I cannot but
think, there was at this time a proper census. The sub∣stance
of the decree was, that all the land should be
enrolled. Again, <HI>All went to be taxed,</HI> or enrolled. And
he intimates very plainly, that <HI>Mary</HI> also was enrolled
with <HI>Joseph.</HI> All these are particulars extremely agree∣able
to the nature of a Roman census.</P>
<P>THOUGH therefore the words in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and espe∣cially
the verb in the first verse, is used for the making
of any kind of entry, yet the whole relation obliges us
to understand it concerning this particular kind of en∣rolment.</P>
<P>AND St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words appear to be extremely pro∣per.
The edicts for a census seem to have generally run
in this form, expressing the duty of the people. There
is in <HI>Cicero</HI> the title of such an edict, published by <HI>Ver∣res</HI>
Praetor of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> when a census was to be made in
<PB N="349" REF="367"/>
that Province. It is called an EDICT concerning the
ENROLMENT<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">EDICTUM DE PROFESSIONE. Cic. in Verr. lib. iii. n. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN a census of the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> the number of
the people was always taken and observed, but there
was a census made of goods and lands, as well as of per∣sons.
This appears from passages already quoted from
<HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> and others. And <HI>Livie</HI> says
expressly, that the very design of the institution was,
that people might contribute to the expenses of the state
not by the Head, but in proportion to their estates<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ut quemadmodum Numa divini auctor juris suisset, ita Servium conditorem omnis in civitate discriminis, ordinumque, quibus inter gradus dignitatis FORTUNAEQUE aliquid interlucet, posteri fama fer∣rent: Censum enim instituit, rem saluberrimam tanto futuro imperio: ex quo belli pacisque munia NON VIRITIM, SED PRO HABITU PE∣CUNIARUM, FIERENT. Liv. lib. l. cap. 42.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND for aught that appears, the same views were
pursued in the assessements made in the provinces. <HI>Ta∣citus</HI>
indeed says that the <HI>Batavi</HI> paid no tribute to the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and furnished the state with arms and<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Nec opibus Romanis, societate validiorum attriti, viros tantum armaque imperio ministrant. Tacit. Hist. lib. iv. cap. 12. Nam nec tributis contem∣nun'ur, nec publicanus atterit, exempti oneribus &amp; collationibus, &amp; tantum in usum praeliorum sepofiti, velut tela atque arma bellis re∣servantur. Id. de Morib. Germ. cap. 29.</NOTE> men
only upon occasion. And some may be disposed to
infer from hence that there might be enrolments made,
in such a province, of the names of the people, and their
conditions of life; in order to know what number of
troops it might furnish the state with.</P>
<P>THIS is very possible, and I think not unlikely.
Tho' I have not yet seen any particular instance of it re∣ferred
to by learned men upon this occasion. Some how∣ever
do suppose that the survey of <HI>Judea</HI> at this time
was made by <HI>Augustus</HI> with this very view<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Breviario igitur quod meditabatur Augustus, quantum militum Judaea suppeditare posset, includi debuit, Basnage. Ann. Polit. Ecc. ante D. 5. n. 11.</NOTE> But I be∣lieve
<HI>Judea</HI> was the last place in which the <HI>Romans</HI> would
look for soldiers. The <HI>Jews</HI> had formerly served the
Kings of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> in their wars; they had like∣wise
<PB N="350" REF="368"/>
been in the Roman armies. But now they had
scruples about serving <HI>Heathens</HI> in this way. And all
of them who were in the service of the <HI>Romans</HI> had been
discharged in form<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. lib. xiv. cap. 10. §. 12.</NOTE> Their own Kings kept foreign
troops in <HI>Judea.</HI> After the conquest of <HI>Egypt, Augustus</HI>
made <HI>Herod</HI> a present of four hundred <HI>Gauls</HI> that had
been the Life Guard of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queen of <HI>Egypt</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Id. de B. J. lib. i. p 1006. 15.</NOTE>.
And in the description of <HI>Herod</HI>'s funeral solemnity,
<HI>Josephus</HI> reckons up three distinct corps of foreign sol∣diers,
<HI>Thracians, Germans,</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid cap. ult. sub sin.</NOTE> Indeed the
<HI>Jews</HI> were at this time so self-willed and tumultuous,
that (as it seems) no Prince was very forward to put
weapons into their hands.</P>
<P>I RECOLLECT but one instance that looks like a
design of any of the Roman Emperours to take <HI>Jews</HI>
into their service. This was in the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
who, as <HI>Suetonius</HI> says, sent the <HI>jewish</HI> youth (who were
at <HI>Rome)</HI> under a sort of military oath into the more
unhealthful provinces<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Judaeorum juverntutem, per speciem sacramenti, in provincias gravioris coeli distribut. vit. Tiber, c. 36. vid. &amp; Tacit. Ann. ii. c. 85.</NOTE>. But this seems to me to have
been more like lending them to the mines, than taking
them into military service. We are certain the <HI>Jews</HI>
did afterward pay tribute to the <HI>Romans.</HI> And perhaps
I may hereafter make it appear they were now, and
had been before this, tributary to the <HI>Romans.</HI> It is
therefore much more likely, that surveys should be
made in <HI>Judea</HI> with a view to tribute than to military
service.</P>
<P>NOR do I perceive, what learned men gain by this.
They think it dishonourable to <HI>Herod</HI> to have the goods
of his Subjects enrolled and rated by a Roman officer
for the paying of tribute. But where lies the difference
between this, and the numbring and entering his peo∣ple
in order to demand for soldiers as many men as his
country could afford? If indeed this enrolment of his
people had been made by <HI>Herod,</HI> by his own authority,
<PB N="351" REF="369"/>
and at his own discretion, in order to furnish the Empe∣rour
with a certain quota of men upon occasion, <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
honour had been saved. But this is not St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
account. <HI>There went out a decree from</HI> Cesar Augustus,
<HI>that all the land should be taxed.</HI> And by virtue of this
decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> all <HI>Herod</HI>'s subjects, men and wo∣men,
in every part of his dominions, were enrolled, with
great exactnesse, and as it seems with great expedition.
And the order of enrolment must have been very pres∣sing.
I do not suppose indeed, that the Virgin was
obliged at all by the decree to go to <HI>Bethlehem:</HI> But I
think, that <HI>Joseph</HI> would not have gone thither, when
she was so near the time of her delivery, if the enrol∣ment
would have admitted of a delay, or could have
been done at another time.</P>
<P>AND that this enrolment was performed by some
Roman officer, as well as ordered by an Imperial de∣cree,
may be very fairly concluded from the parenthe∣sis,
<HI>ver.</HI> 2. Since the main intention of it is to distin∣guish
it from another, which was certainly made by a
Roman Officer.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Whiston</HI> indeed says, <HI>It is very probable that the
enrolment of the</HI> Jews <HI>was made by</HI> Herod, <HI>at the request
of</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Short view of the Harm. of the four Evang. p. 149.</NOTE> Augustus. It would have been to Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s
purpose to give a few specimens of this stile <HI>of Augustus</HI>
or of the Republic toward some of their dependent no∣minal
Kings. But it would not have signified much in
this case, because St. <HI>Luke</HI> does not say, <HI>there went out</HI>
a request from <HI>Cesar Augustus,</HI> but a <HI>Decree.</HI> And there∣fore
we should have been still obliged to call it a <HI>decree.</HI>
And I believe, we may do so very safely. We shall find
by and by, from the history of <HI>Herod,</HI> that it is very
unlikely that <HI>Augustus</HI> should have sent <HI>Herod</HI> any <HI>re∣quests</HI>
about this time.</P>
<P>AGAIN: Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> supposes <HI>that</HI> Herod <HI>the King
of the</HI> Jews <HI>was requested or required to get him</HI> [Augu∣stus]
<HI>a like exact account of the jewish nation, as he had
already attained of the rest of the Roman Empire.</HI> But if
<PB N="352" REF="370"/>
this had been all that <HI>Augustus</HI> did, namely, <HI>requiring</HI>
or <HI>requesting</HI> this of <HI>Herod,</HI> then <HI>Herod</HI> must have issued
a command or order to all his people to enrolle them∣selves.
But how came St. <HI>Luke</HI> to mention <HI>Augustus</HI>'s
requirement or request to <HI>Herod,</HI> and call it a decree
too, and yet say nothing of <HI>Herod</HI>'s order? I think,
St. <HI>Luke</HI> does plainly represent the people of <HI>Judea</HI> in
motion for enrolling themselves in their several cities in
obedience to <HI>Augustus</HI>'s decree; and he says nothing of
<HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have thought that this enrolment was the ef∣fect
of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s curiosity. And some expressions of
<HI>Claudius</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Et quidem cum ad census novo turn opere &amp; inadsueto Galliis, ad bellum avocatus esset. Quod opus, quam arduum nobis sit, nunc cum maxime, quamvis nihil ultra quam ut publice notae sint facultates nostrae exquiratur, nimis magno experimento cognoscimus. Vid. Lips. excurs. ad Tacit. Ann. xi. A.</NOTE> in his speech to the Senate about giving the
freedom of the City to the <HI>Gauls</HI> have been alledged by
learned men as a proof, that assessements were some∣times
made in the provinces purely out of curiosity,
For he says, that he had found a census to be a very dif∣ficult
work, even when nothing more was intended by
it, than to know, what his Estate (or <HI>riches</HI>) was. But
even from these words it appears, that an account was
taken of the estates of the people, as well as their
names and conditions of life. And the Censors must
have made an estimation: Otherwise the value could
never have been known with any certainty. Besides I
think, that all the Emperour intends here, is, that he
could easily conceive with what difficulty a census was
at first introduced into a province, when even now a
fresh census was seldom made without some disturbance.
And as a proof of this, he instances in the rebellion,
which the first census of <HI>Gaul</HI> produced in that coun∣try
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Livie</HI> speaks likewise of this disturbance. Tumultus, qui ob censum exortus erat, compost∣tus. <HI>Epitome libri</HI> 137. <HI>Liviani.</HI></NOTE> And tho' he calls this renewing a census, only an
inquiry that his estate or revenue might be publickly
known: yet certainly the tribute to be paid according
<PB N="353" REF="371"/>
to the census is not to be excluded. Princes do not,
nor is it reasonable they should, reckon their people on∣ly,
all their riches. The revenue arising from the tri∣bute
or taxes which they pay is certainly a part of the
Prince's riches. The Emperour's meaning therefore is,
that the making of a census now is not the imposing any
new hardship: the great use of them is to preserve ex∣actnesse
and order in the state of the revenues; and yet
they give people uneasinesse: How much more must
they have done so formerly?</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the taxing afterwards made in <HI>Judea</HI>
was certainly a census of goods as well as persons. And
yet when St. <HI>Luke</HI> makes mention of it in <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Act. v. 37.</NOTE>
speech, he uses the same words he does here.</P>
<P>ALL the first Christians thought this was a census of
goods. It is apparent that <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> thought so,
in that he tells the Emperour and the Senate, it was
made by their first procurator in <HI>Judea. Tertullian</HI>
makes no scruple to call it very plainly a census. And
<HI>Eusebius</HI> in his chronicle says expresly, that enrolments
were then made of goods as well as of persons. All
these considerations, if I mistake not, render it highly
probable, that according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> there was now a
proper census made in <HI>Judea</HI> throughout the territories
of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though it be supposed, that here was now a
census made, yet a census is not a tax. Assessements
were certainly made, that tribute might be paid accor∣ding
to them: and where a census was made, a tribute
might be required. But yet it might be forbore or re∣mitted.
And whether any tribute was raised upon this
census or not, I leave at present undetermined.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the affair St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives us an account
of to have been a Roman census, it is possible two or
there enquiries may be here made. (1.) What occa∣sion
was there for <HI>Joseph</HI> to enrolle himself, since he was
a poor man; as may be concluded from the lesser of∣fering,
<PB N="354" REF="372"/>
which the Virgin made at the temple for her
purification?</P>
<P>I answer, that it was the custom in a Roman census,
for persons of all employments and characters to enter
themselves; as appears from the descriptions given of it,
in the authors which I have before quoted. And tho'
<HI>Joseph</HI> was not a rich man, it does not follow he had no∣thing.
However, whatever his condition was, the edict
obliged him to give in an account of himself to the offi∣cers,
unless there was a particular exception made, and
only such persons were required to appear who were pos∣sessed
of estates to such a value. <HI>Augustus</HI> seems once
to have made such a census of the Roman citizens<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. l. 55. p. 557. B.</NOTE>.
But that this was not the usual method, is evident, be∣cause
this particular circumstance of that census is men∣tioned
as somewhat extraordinary.</P>
<P>(2.) SINCE <HI>Joseph</HI> lived in <HI>Galilee,</HI> how came he to
go up from thence to be registred at <HI>Bethlehem?</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer, that possibly he might be obliged
to it by virtue of some clause in the Edict. <HI>Ulpian</HI> says<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is verò qui agrum in aliâ civitate habet, in eâ civitate profiteri debet, in quâ ager est. Agri enim tributum in eam civitatem debet levare, in cujus territorio possidetur. l. 4. §. 2. ff. de censibus.</NOTE>,
that persons ought to enrolle themselves in the place
where their estate lies. Though <HI>Joseph</HI> was not rich,
yet he might have some small inheritance in or near
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and might be obliged to go thither upon
that account. But this I do not insist upon here.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> gives us this reason of his going to <HI>Bethle∣hem:
because he was of the house and linage of David,</HI> v. 4.
It is probable, that this journey was owing to the cu∣stom
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who, whenever they were numbered,
entred themselves according to their tribes and families.
If against this it be objected, That the <HI>Jews</HI> had lost
the registers of their families before this time: I an∣swer,
that this does not appear. They were reckoned
<PB N="355" REF="373"/>
by them to be of great importance. And it is not un∣likely,
that many, if not most of them, had the registers
of their families till the final ruine of their state and con∣stitution,
and perhaps for some time after it. <HI>Anna</HI> is
said to be the <HI>daughter</HI> of Phanuel, <HI>of the</HI> TRIBE OF AS∣SER,
<HI>Luke</HI> ii. 36. <HI>Barnabas</HI> was a LEVITE, <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 36.
<HI>Paul</HI> affirms, that he was of the TRIBE OF BENJAMIN,
<HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 1. Phil. iii. 5. And these two were born in fo∣reign
countries, the one in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the other at <HI>Tarsus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS,</HI> the <HI>jewish</HI> Historian, having men∣tioned
the time of his birth, and the names of several of
his ancestors; says, “Thus have I given an account of
my family,” as I found it in the publick records<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. in vit. init.</NOTE>.
It is true, <HI>Josephus</HI> was of the race of the priests, and
their registers might be kept with greater care and ex∣actnesse
than others: But it is evident from what he
says of the marriages of the priests, that the registers
of other families were in being likewise. “Every priest,
<HI>says he,</HI> among us is obliged to marry a woman of his
own nation, and not so much to regard money or any
other advantages, but to make an exact enquiry into
her descent, and to accept of no account but what is
well attested. This is done not in <HI>Judea</HI> only, but
in all places, where-ever there is any part of our
nation, this law relating to the marriages of the
priests is most carefully observed; I mean, in <HI>Egypt</HI>
and <HI>Babylon,</HI> and every other part of the world, in
which any of our priests live<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Cont. Apion, l. i. §. 7.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>(3.) WHAT necessity was there, for the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>
to go to <HI>Bethlehem?</HI> Surely every master of a fa∣mily
was not obliged by a Roman census, to appear
<PB N="356" REF="374"/>
before the officer, with his wife, children and servants,
if he had any.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that I know not of any obligation she
was under by virtue of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s edict to go to <HI>Bethle∣hem</HI>
at this time: But yet <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> might
choose it. And they might have very good reasons for
it that we are unacquainted with. St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>Ch.</HI> ii.
41, 42. <HI>Now his parents went to</HI> Jerusalem <HI>every year,
at the feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve
years old, they went up to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>after the custom of
the feast.</HI> And yet by the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> the males only
were obliged to appear before God at the great feasts.
And many learned men are of opinion, that our Saviour
did not go up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> till this passover (which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> here speaks of) when he was <HI>twelve years</HI> of
age: though his Parents, <HI>Mary,</HI> as it seems, as well as
<HI>Joseph,</HI> had gone up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> every year; <HI>i. e.</HI> from
their last settlement in <HI>Galilee,</HI> after their return from
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>3. I SHALL now give a general description of the
state and condition of <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Herod,</HI> that we may
be able to judge whether a Roman census could be made
in it by virtue of a decree of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman Empire</HI> extended at this time to all the
most considerable countries of the known world, whe∣ther
situated in <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> or <HI>Africa.</HI> Beside those
countries which were properly called provinces, and
were governed by officers sent from <HI>Rome,</HI> with the ti∣tle
of Presidents, Praetors, or Proconsuls; there were
other countries governed by Kings, Tetrarchs or Dy∣nasts,
dependent upon the Roman State.</P>
<P>IN the state and condition of these dependent Princes,
there was a considerable difference. Some few received
their crown from the Emperour, and acknowledged a
dependence, but paid no tribute<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Appian. in Praes. init.</NOTE>; among the rest, who
were in a more proper subjection, some were call'd Friends
of the Emperour or the Roman State. This was undoubt∣edly
<PB N="357" REF="375"/>
a very great honour, especially when conferred in

with a part of their troops, or with sums of money
upon particular occasions; or made presents to the
Emperour and his ministers, when needful. That is,
they paid tribute in the genteelest way. Others were
more properly tributary, and were obliged to the pay∣ment
of certain sums of money: but it is generally sup∣posed
that they raised it themselves among their people
by their own officers. But I suspect that many of those
princes, called Friends, were properly tributary, and
that the Emperour had an officer in the territories of
most of them who took care of his revenue. Beside these,
there were (if I mistake not) some countries under the
government of dependent Kings, in which a tribute was
raised in the way of a Roman census.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was a dependent Prince, I think was
never denied. He obtained the kingdome of <HI>Judea</HI> at
first by virtue of a decree of the Roman<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bel. l. i. cap. 14. fin.</NOTE> Senate;
and was assisted in taking possession of it by Roman
troops commanded by their own<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 18.</NOTE> officers. <HI>Augustus</HI>
gave him leave to nominate for his successor which of
his sons he pleased. But yet in his last will there was a
clause, by which the final determination of all was sub∣mitted
to the will and pleasure of the Emperour. And
after his death his sons were obliged to go to <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Bel. lib. ii. cap. 2.</NOTE>
to obtain the grant and confirmation of <HI>Augustus,</HI> be∣fore
they dared to take possession of the territories as∣sined
them by their father.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was tributary to <HI>Augustus</HI> immediate∣ly
before his death, seems evident from the sentence pro∣nounced
by the Emperour after he had considered <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
will. “To <HI>Archelaus</HI> were given, <HI>says Josephus,
<PB N="358" REF="376"/>
Idumea,</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> and the country of the <HI>Samari∣tans.</HI>
These were eased of a fourth part of their tri∣bute.
<HI>Cesar</HI> decreeing them this relief, because they
had not joined with the other people in their late di∣sturbances
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. Ant. l. 17. c xiii. §. 4. vid. &amp; de Bell. l. ii. c. vi.</NOTE>.” I think it most reasonable to under∣stand
this of a tribute paid, or to be paid, not to <HI>Herod</HI>
or <HI>Achearus,</HI> but to the Emperour. If the <HI>Samaritans</HI>
were tributary to <HI>Cesar,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> were so likewise. It
is plain these were not more favoured than the former.
And they were both equally subject to <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Ar∣chelaus.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> had been always tributary to the <HI>Ro∣man
Empire,</HI> may be inferred from what <HI>Agrippa</HI> the
younger says to the <HI>Jews</HI> in his speech to disswade
them from the war. “At this time, <HI>says he,</HI> the de∣sire
of liberty in unseasonable. It had been much bet∣ter
to have maintained it with vigour formerly.—
Then all ought to have been done that was possible,
to have kept out the <HI>Romans,</HI> when <HI>Pompey</HI> first
entred into this land. But our ancestors, and their
kings, superior to you in wealth, in strength and con∣duct,
yielded to a small part of the Roman power.
And you now the hereditary subjects of the <HI>Romans</HI>
attempt to resist their whole Empire<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 16. p. 1035, 1086.</NOTE>.” And
<HI>Josephs</HI> in his speech to the <HI>Jews</HI> besieged in <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI>
to perswade them to surrender to <HI>Titus,</HI> plainly
dates the beginning of the <HI>jewish servitude</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI>

from hence, that from that time the <HI>Jews</HI> were
tributary to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Subjection and servitude must
needs imply the paying of Tribute.</P>
<P><HI>APPIAN</HI> mentions <HI>Herod</HI> King of the <HI>Idumeans</HI>
and <HI>Samaritans</HI> among the other Kings, who, accord∣ing
to <HI>Mark Antony</HI>'s direction, were to bring in a cer∣tain
prescribed tribute<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. v. p. 1135.</NOTE> <HI>Antony</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> were al∣ways
very good friends, and it cannot be supposed that
<HI>Herod</HI> was better used by <HI>Augustus</HI> than he had been by
<HI>Antony.</HI></P>
<P>IN the story of the difference between <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Syl∣laeus</HI>
the <HI>Arabian,</HI> which difference seems to have arose
about three years before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death, and to have
continued a year or two at lest, if not as long as <HI>Herod</HI>
lived, there is a passage that deserves to be observed
in this place. “<HI>Syllaeus</HI> moreover bribed <HI>Fabatus,
Cesar</HI>'s Procurator, and employ'd him against <HI>He∣rod.</HI>
But <HI>Herod</HI> by a larger sum of money drew off
<HI>Fabatus</HI> from <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> and by him required the per∣formance
of those things which <HI>Cesar</HI> had ordered [<HI>to
be done by Syllaeus</HI>]. However <HI>Syllaeus</HI> went on in his
old way, performed none of those things; and more∣over
accused <HI>Fabatus</HI> to <HI>Caesar,</HI> saying, that he was a
Procurator more in <HI>Herod</HI>'s interests than the Empe∣rour's
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph, de Bell. l. 1. c. 29. p. 1030. v. 21.—</NOTE>.” By <HI>Procurator</HI> can be meant no other
than an officer that took care of the Emperour's reve∣nue.
And the nature of the charge seems to imply,
<PB N="360" REF="378"/>
that <HI>Fabatus</HI> had a trust under the Emperour in <HI>Herod</HI>'s
dominions. This indeed may be questioned, because
that afterwards, <HI>Syllacus</HI> having killed <HI>Fabatus, Aretas</HI>
the King of <HI>Arabia</HI> prosecuted <HI>Syllaeus</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> for the
murder of <HI>Fabatus,</HI> as well as for other crimes commit∣ted
by him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. Ant. lib. xvii. cap. 3.</NOTE> And from hence it may be inferred
by some, that <HI>Fabatus</HI> was rather an officer in <HI>Arabia.</HI>
Let it be so. However, here is a proof, that the Em∣perour
had a Procurator to take care of his tribute or re∣venue
in the country of a dependent Prince: for such
was the King of <HI>Arabia.</HI> And it is not impossible, that
<HI>Fabatus</HI> might be concerned in both those Kingdoms,
of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole then, <HI>Herod</HI> was always a depen∣dent
tributary Prince. Whether he was at last obliged
to submit to a census, will be the subject of enquiry
under the next head.</P>
<P>ALL that I would shew farther here is, that a census
was not inconsistent with the rights allowed to these de∣pendent
Princes, according to the Roman constitution.
This is generally denied, therefore some proof must be
given of it. But it cannot be expected, that I should
produce many examples of a census in dependent king∣doms:
partly, because the Roman Historians never
take any notice of these things, unless they are attend∣ed
with some accidents that render them remarkable:
and partly, because the <HI>Romans</HI> had several ways of rais∣ing
tribute; and a census, which was the most disagree∣able
way of all, was not used in all those countries that
were properly provinces.</P>
<P>AFTER the battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> in which <HI>Brutus</HI> and
<HI>Cassius</HI> were defeated, <HI>Mark Antony</HI> went over into <HI>Asia,</HI>
and coming to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> summoned the States of the na∣tions
thereabout to give him a meeting. In a speech
he made to these States, among other things, he tells
them: “Your King <HI>Attalus</HI> bequeathed his kingdome
to us by testament. Our government has been milder
than his was. For we remitted the taxes you had
<PB N="361" REF="379"/>
been wont to pay to him, till men of turbulent spirits
arose amongst us, and laid us under a necessity of de∣manding
tribute of you. And even then we did not
impose it upon you in the way of a census, that we
might collect it with less hazard and trouble to our
selves, and required only the annual payment of a
sum of money out of the produce of your country<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. v. p. 1074.</NOTE>.”
In the conclusion they agreed to pay a whole nine years
tribute in two years time. The battle of <HI>Philippi</HI> was
fought<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vid. Petavii Rationarium Temporum Par. i. lib. iv. cap. 20.</NOTE>, A. U. 712. <HI>Attalus</HI> died<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Vid. ibid. cap. 14.</NOTE>, A. U. 621. So
that <HI>Asia</HI> (<HI>Propria</HI>) had been a province 90 years, and
yet they had not had any census among them. It is not
likely therefore, that we should meet with many in∣stances
of a census made in dependent kingdoms.</P>
<P><HI>TACITUS</HI> however has given us one instance. “A∣bout
this time, <HI>says he,</HI> the <HI>Cilicians</HI> subject to <HI>Arche∣laus</HI>
the <HI>Cappadocian</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Or, that had been subject to <HI>Archelaus</HI> the <HI>Cappadocian.</HI></NOTE>, being required to enrolle
themselves in our way, and to pay tribute accordingly,
withdrew themselves into the fastnesses of mount <HI>Tau∣rus:</HI>
and by the advantage of the situation, maintained
themselves against the weak forces of the King; till
<HI>Marcus Trebellius</HI> came into his assistance from <HI>Vitelli∣us</HI>
President of <HI>Syria</HI> with four thousand Roman sol∣diers,
and a body of Auxiliaries<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Per idem tempus Clitarum natio Cappadoci Archelao subjecta, quia nostrum in modum deferre census, pati tributa adigebantur, in juga Tauri Montis abscessit: locorumque ingenio sese contra regis im∣belles copias tutabantur; donec M.

<P>BY <HI>Cilicia</HI> I here understand, not <HI>Cilicia the Plain
[Cilica Campestris</HI>], which had been a Roman province
long before this, but <HI>Cilicia the Rugged [Aspera],</HI> which
had been annexed by <HI>Augustus</HI> to the Kingdome of <HI>Cap∣padocia</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="380"/>
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Vid. Strabonem lib. xiv. p. 987. D.</NOTE>. It is true, that upon the death of old <HI>Ar∣chelaus,</HI>
A. U. 770, A. D. 17<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">C. Coelio L. Pomponio Coss.</NOTE>, the Kingdome of
<HI>Cappadocia</HI> was reduced to the state of a province<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Regnum in provinciam redactum est. Tacit. Ann. lib. ii. cap. 42.</NOTE>; and
this disturbance, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> here speaks of, is placed
by him in A. U. 789. A. D. 36<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Q. Plautio &amp; Sext. Papinio Coss.</NOTE> But <HI>Tacitus</HI> has no
where said, that this <HI>Cilicia</HI> was made a province. If it
had, he must have known it; and could not have spoke
of it, as he does here. He says, that the people main∣tained
themselves in their fastnesses against the <HI>King's
weak forces,</HI> till a General arrived from <HI>Vitellius</HI> with a
reinforcement of Roman soldiers. If it had been a pro∣vince,
he would have said, that the people had been too
hard for the troops which the Prefect had with him.
And this account is in the main confirmed by several
other Historians, who say, that this <HI>Cilicia</HI> was govern∣ed
by Kings till the time of <HI>Vespasian</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Item Thraciam, Ciliciam, &amp; Comagenem ditionis regiae usque ad id tempus, in provinciae formam redegit.

<P>NOR is it very hard to trace the fortune of this peo∣ple

For <HI>Dio</HI> says, that <HI>Caligula</HI> gave the <HI>Maritime

has given or another tumult of this people, A. U. 805.

to have been then subject to <HI>Antiochus</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nec multo post agrestium ciliciumnationes, quibus Clitarum cognomentum, saepe &amp; alias commotae, tune Trosobore duce, mon∣tes asperos castris cepere.—Dein rex ejus orae Antiochus, blandi∣mentis adversus plebem, fraude in ducem, cum barbarorum copias dislocasset, Trosobore paucisque primoribus interfectis, ceteros cle∣mentia composuit.

<PB N="363" REF="381"/>
is likely they continued under him, till it was made a
province by <HI>Vespasian;</HI> because <HI>Comagene</HI> also was at that
time reduced to a province, as appears from <HI>Suetonius</HI>
and <HI>Eutropius</HI> already quoted; and from <HI>Josephus,</HI> who
says, that this <HI>Antiochus</HI> was dispossessed of all his do∣minions
in the fourth year of <HI>Vespasian</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joseph. de Bell. Jud. lib. vii. cap. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE only difficulty is, who they were subject to,
when this census was ordered to be made among them
in the latter end of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign. For by the manner,
in which the first words of this passage of <HI>Tacitus</HI> are
quoted by Cardinal <HI>Noris</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Noris Cenotaph. Pis. Diss. ii. pag. 308.</NOTE>, and by <HI>Pagi</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Appar. ad annal. num. 127.</NOTE> from
him, they must have understood by <HI>Archelao subjecta,</HI>
the people <HI>that had been subject to Archelaus,</HI> that is, to
<HI>Archelaus</HI> the King of <HI>Cappadocia.</HI> However, <HI>Lipsius</HI>
and <HI>Muretus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> understand <HI>Tacitus</HI> to say, that they
were then <HI>subject to Archelaus,</HI> a son of the former <HI>Ar∣chelaus,</HI>
who died at <HI>Rame,</HI> A. U. 770.</P>
<P>I AM under no obligation to determine this matter,
because it is the same thing to my purpose, whether they
were now subject to the King of <HI>Comagene</HI> or some other
dependent prince, or whether they were subject to a son
of the old <HI>Archelaus</HI> King of <HI>Cappadocia;</HI> the <HI>imbelles regis copiae,</HI> the <HI>King's weak forces,</HI> proving they were un∣der
a King. But it seems to me most natural to inter∣prêt
<HI>Tacitus,</HI> as <HI>Lipsius</HI> does. The <HI>imbelles regis copiae</HI>
imply, that a King had been mentioned before; and
therefore <HI>Archelao subjecta</HI> cannot be very fairly under∣stood
to mean no more than a description of these <HI>Cili∣cians,</HI>
to distinguish them from others of that name.</P>
<P><HI>TIBERIUS</HI> had been indeed very angry with old
<HI>Archelaus.</HI> But neverthelesse he might be willing, when
he had made his kingdome of <HI>Cappadocia</HI> a province, to
give one of his sons this small appendage of it. This
<PB N="364" REF="382"/>
<HI>Cilicia</HI> was far from being any strong temptation. The
country was mountainous, and the people were apt to
turn to robbery or piracy, and for these reasons they had
been given before by <HI>Augustus</HI> to the above-mentioned
<HI>Archelaus</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Vid. Strabo. l. xiv. p. 987. D.</NOTE> <HI>Cappadocia</HI> had been a very rich booty
to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> Upon its being made a province, by the
ready mony and effects of <HI>Archelaus</HI> and the revenues of
the country, such sums came into the public treasury of
the <HI>Romany</HI> that their tax called the hundreth fell im∣mediately
to a two hundreth<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Regnum ejus in provinciam redactum est; fructibusque ejus le∣vari posse centesimae vectigal, professus Caesar, ducentesimam in po∣serum statuit Tacit. Ann. lib. ii. cap. 42.</NOTE> We may therefore
suppose, that by <HI>Archelaus</HI> here is meant a son of the for∣mer
King of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> though he be an obseure per∣son.
And the weaknesse of the king's forces is an ar∣gument,
that he was no considerable prince, and that
these people were his only subjects.</P>
<P>THOUGH here be but one example, it is sufficient
for my design. I believe it was disgraceful to a Prince,
to have a census made in his dominions. However,
<HI>Tacitus</HI> does not insinuate, that there was any injustice
in it, or that it was absolutely inconsistent with the
rights indulged to dependent Princes: and the King,
to whom this people were subject, supported this cen∣sus,
as far as he was able.</P>
<P>4. I AM now to enquire, whether we have any rea∣sons
to believe, that there was a census made in <HI>Judea</HI>
it this time.</P>
<P>WE can hope for no light in this matter from any
author but <HI>Josephus,</HI> except the notice which the Chri∣stian
writers have taken of it. If we will rely upon
them, I think the point is decided already: but at pre∣sent
we will lay aside their testimonies, and confine our
enquiries to <HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was always tributary, has been prov∣ed.
I apprehend, that toward the later end of his
reign there was some alteration made in his circum∣stances
<PB N="365" REF="383"/>
for the worse. In order to judge or the evidence
there is for it, we must trace the history of <HI>Herod</HI>'s af∣fairs
about this time.</P>
<P><HI>OBODAS</HI> was now King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Syllaeus</HI>
his chief Officer under him, who indeed administred all
affairs of that country with almost kingly authority.
<HI>Herod</HI> had lent <HI>Obodas</HI> a considerable sum of money:
When the time of payment came, <HI>Herod</HI> demanded
the money, but in vain. Moreover a band of robbers
had infected <HI>Herod</HI>'s dominions and carried off several of
his Subjects, and were afterwards sheltered by <HI>Obodas</HI>
and <HI>Syllaeus</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> These differences between the
two courts of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> were brought before
<HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius,</HI> the Emperour's chief officers
in <HI>Syria,</HI> the neighbouring province. Here it was sti∣pulated,
that <HI>Herod</HI> should surrender to <HI>Obodas</HI> all the
<HI>Arabians</HI> he had in his custody, and that <HI>Obodas</HI> should
release all <HI>jewish</HI> prisoners, and pay the money he owed
in thirty days time<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Joseph Ant. lib. xvi. cap. q. p. 734.</NOTE>. But when this time was expir∣ed,
none of these conditions were performed on the
part of the <HI>Arabians.</HI> And <HI>Syllaeus</HI> full of resentment
against <HI>Herod</HI> sails for <HI>Rome.</HI> The terms agreed upon
not having been performed by <HI>Obodas, Herod,</HI> with the
consent of <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius,</HI> marches into <HI>Ara∣bia,</HI>
and routs the forces that opposed him. Advice of
this is immediately sent to <HI>Syllaeus</HI> then in <HI>Italic</HI> He
procures an audience of <HI>Augustus;</HI> tells him, That
<HI>Herod</HI> had made an incursion into <HI>Arabia,</HI> laid wast the
country, and killed five and twenty hundred <HI>Arabians</HI>
with their General. <HI>Augustus</HI> having heard this, en∣quires
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> and of persons who
arrived from <HI>Syria,</HI> whether this was matter of fact.
Being assured it was, without ever asking the occasion,
“He writes a letter to <HI>Herod</HI> in very angry terms,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. ibid. p. 735.</NOTE>
The substance of this letter was. That whereas he
<PB N="366" REF="384"/>
had hitherto treated him as a FRIEND, he mould for
the future treat him as a SUBJECT.”</P>
<P><HI>HEROD</HI> then sent ambassadors to <HI>Rome:</HI> But
they were forced to return without so much as obtaining
an audience. A second ambassy likewise went to <HI>Rome</HI>
without any effect<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 736. init.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Obodos</HI> dies, and <HI>Aretas</HI> takes up∣on
him the crown of <HI>Arabia:</HI> and then sends away any
bassadours to <HI>Rome,</HI> with large presents; withal accus∣ing
<HI>Syllaeus,</HI> his predecessor's chief minister, of many
great crimes. But <HI>Syllaeus</HI> was still in great favour at
<HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Augustus</HI> was offended, that <HI>Aretas</HI> had ta∣ken
upon him the government of <HI>Arabia</HI> without first
obtaining his leave. And sent back the ambassadours
without receiving the presents, or admitting them to an
audience. “The affairs of these two kingdoms of <HI>Ju∣dea</HI>
and <HI>Arabia</HI> were then in a very bad posture. In
one there was a King not confirmed in his govern∣ment.
And <HI>Herod</HI> having lost the Emperour's favour
was forced to submit to many disgraces and affronts.
Seeing no end of these evils, he resolved to send once
more an ambassy to <HI>Rome,</HI> and to try whether he
could gain friends there, and by them recover the
Emperour's good will. The person sent upon this
occasion was <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. P. 736.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Nicolas,</HI> who was ever firm to <HI>Herod</HI>'s inte∣rest,
was a man of great abilities and of admirable ad∣dresse.
When he came to <HI>Rome, Syllaeus</HI>'s power was
declining: New informations against him had been
brought from <HI>Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Nicolas</HI> artfully joining in
with the <HI>Arabians</HI> procures an audience of <HI>Augustus;</HI>
and having first supported the charges brought by
them against <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> he proceeded to the defense of
<PB N="367" REF="385"/>
<HI>Herod.</HI> “Here the Emperour stopped him short, and
bid him answer, whether <HI>Herod</HI> had not marched his
forces into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and slain five and twenty hundred
men?” To which <HI>Nicolas</HI> replied: That the things
the Emperour had heard concerning <HI>Herod</HI> were in
part true and in part false, and that the occasion of all
had been concealed from him. He informed the Em∣perour
of the differences between <HI>Obodas</HI> and <HI>Herod:</HI>
That certain stipulations had been entered into in the
presence of <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius:</HI> That <HI>Syllaeus</HI> had
sworn by the Emperour's Fortune, that the terms
agreed upon should be punctually executed, but that
nothing had been done: That <HI>Herod</HI> had not moved his
forces, till he had first obtained the consent of the Em∣perour's
chief officers in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that the numbers of
the slain had been very much magnified. <HI>Augustus,</HI>
perceiving that his displeasure against <HI>Herod</HI> had been
built upon misrepresentations, was appeased; and at
length pronounced a sentence, that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> should re∣turn
home, give <HI>Herod</HI> satissaction, and then be punish∣ed
for his crimes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. cap. 10. pag. 740, 741.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOME time after this we have an account of some
disturbances in <HI>Herod</HI>'s family. A very strict friendship
had commenced between <HI>Antipater Herod</HI>'s eldest son,
<HI>Pheroras Herod</HI>'s brother, and <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife, who
was particularly disagreeable to <HI>Herod. Salome, He∣rod</HI>'s
sister, who knew almost every thing, suspected
that these three were carrying on designs against her
brother. She came and told him what she knew; and
<HI>Herod</HI> had had some intelligence before, and was full
of suspicions, but what he had heard was not fully con∣firmed.
There follows immediately upon this, a pas∣sage
of so extraordinary a nature, that it must be
transcribed without any abridgement, “There was
moreover, <HI>says</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. cap. z. §. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus,</HI> a certain sect of <HI>Jews,</HI>
<PB N="368" REF="386"/>
who valued themselves highly for their exact know∣ledge
of the law; and talking much of their interest
with God, were greatly in favour with the women.
They are called <HI>Pharisees,</HI> men who had it in their
power to controle Kings; extremely subtle, and
ready to attempt any thing against those whom they
did not like. When therefore the whole <HI>jewish</HI> nation
took an oath to be faithful to <HI>Cesar</HI> and the interests
of the King, these men to the number of above six
thousand refused to swear. The King having laid a
fine upon them, <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife paid the money for
them. They, in requital for this her kindnesse (for
they were supposed by their great intimacy with God
to have attained to the gift of foreknowledge) fore∣told,
that God having decreed to put an end to the
government of <HI>Herod</HI> and his race, the kingdome
would be transferred to her and <HI>Pheroras</HI> and their
children. <HI>Salome,</HI> who was ignorant of none of these
things, came and told the King of them, and allured
him likewise, that many of the court were corrupt∣ed
by them. Then the King put to death the mod
guilty of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and <HI>Bagoas</HI> the eunuch, and
one <HI>Carus,</HI> the most beautiful young man about the
<PB N="369" REF="387"/>
court, and the great instrument in the King's unlaw∣ful
pleasures. He likewise shew every one in his own
family which adhered to those things which were said
by the <HI>Pharisees.</HI> But <HI>Bagoas</HI> had been elevated by
them, in that he should be called father and benefac∣tor,
the King who was to be appointed according to
their prediction (for all things would be in his power)
being to give him a capacity of marriage, and of ha∣ving
children of his own.”</P>
<P>IN the margin<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This passage of <HI>Josephus</HI> has been already quoted very often by learned men, who have treated of this Census, or of the true time of our Saviour's nativity. But all, whom I have seen, have follow∣ed <HI>Gelenius</HI>'s version of these last words, which is thus: Nam Ba∣goas in eam spem sublatus erat, quasi parens &amp; benefactor appellandus regis, quem destinarent vaticinia; prospere enim cessura novo regi omnia, constabiliendo successionem prolis legitimae. I suppose they did not look upon the original. If they had, they would have easily perceived his mistake. Nor does the argument, that this af∣fair has a relation to our Census, stand thus in it's full force, as will appear by and by. Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI> has very much corrected <HI>Gelenius</HI>'s version, and translates the concluding words thus: Fuit autem per eos elatus Bagoas, quod discerent eum patrem beneficumque appella∣turn iri ejus, qui ex eorum pracdictione creandus rex esset; habitu∣rum enim eum regem omnium rerum potestatem, &amp; Bagoae vires conciliaturum cum muliere congrediendi. propriosque liberos gignendi. But, methinks, the sense of this is not very extraordinary. <HI>Bagoat</HI> is to receive a great benefit from the King, and bestows none upon him, that I see; and yet he <HI>is to be called his Father and Benefactor.</HI> I think, that <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that the Pharisees gave out, that Bagoat was to become, or <HI>to be called, a Father;</HI> and hereby, that is, by his having children would also be a benefactor to his country. I have made no alteration in the original words of <HI>Josephus.</HI> I have only inserted a comma after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and changed the colon after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to a comma. This interpretation is not my own. I had it from my learned and ingenious friend, Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> to whom I am very much indebted for this, and divers other critical observations, which I highly value.</NOTE> I justify my version of this passage,
as to one particular, in which it is singular. But beside
that, poslibly some may have a scruple about this sen∣tence:
<HI>He likewise slew every one of his own family, who
adhered to those things which were said by the Pharisees.</HI>
The original word is in the singular number, <HI>which
were said by the Pharisee,</HI> or which <HI>the Pharisee said.</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="388"/>
If any should be apt to think from hence, that this has
reference to some thing said by some particular <HI>Phari∣see,</HI>
I must desire them to consider the context. It is
evident from what goes before and follows that period,
that the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in general were concerned in this af∣fair,
though some only were punished, the <HI>most guilty,</HI>
as <HI>Josephus</HI> calls them. The same phrase is in another
place used by <HI>Josephus,</HI> where the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in general
are intended. Thus he says: “The <HI>Sadducees,</HI> when in
office, usually go into the measures<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 18. c. I. §. 4.</NOTE> of the <HI>Phari∣sees:</HI>”
In the original it is, <HI>of the Pharisee.</HI></P>
<P>I TAKE this oath, which <HI>Josephus</HI> here speaks of,
to be the same thing with St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s <HI>taxing,</HI> for these
reasons.</P>
<P>(1.) As far as I can perceive, this oath must have
been taken much about the fame time with the taxing
or census mentioned by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> according to all those
who place the nativity of Jesus some time between
twelve, or fifteen months and two years before the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) THERE is a great variety of circumstances at∣tending
this oath in <HI>Josephus,</HI> that accord with the hi∣story
the Evangelists have given us of the birth of Jesus.
I imagine I am very much prevented by the reader, but
I shall specifie some of them.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says: <HI>There went out a decree from</HI> CESAR
AUGUSTUS, <HI>that all the land should be taxed.</HI> The sub∣stance
of the oath in <HI>Josephus</HI> was to <HI>be faithful to</HI> CESAR,
as well as to <HI>Herod.</HI> An oath is a formal acknowledge∣ment
of subjection, as well as an engagement to fidelity,
No greater acknowledgement of subjection could be
made than an enrolment in a Roman census. St. <HI>Luke</HI>
says, the decree was, that <HI>all the land</HI> should be taxed,
and that <HI>all went to be taxed. Josephus</HI> agrees with him
surprisingly, when he says, that <HI>All the jewish nation</HI> took
the oath, except six thousand <HI>Pharisees.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="389"/>
ST. <HI>Luke</HI>'s <HI>Taxing</HI> and <HI>Josephu</HI>'s <HI>Oath</HI> are followed
with parallel events. When the wise men came, saying:
<HI>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</HI> Herod <HI>was
troubled and all</HI> Jerusalem <HI>with him. Josephus</HI>'s account
is a perfect comment upon St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
says: <HI>When he</HI> [Herod] <HI>had gathered the</HI> CHIEF PRIESTS
AND SCRIBES <HI>of the people together, he demanded of them
where</HI> CHRIST <HI>should be born. And they said unto him,
in</HI>
Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea: <HI>for thus it is written by the</HI> PROPHET;
<HI>and thou</HI> Bethlehem—<HI>art not the least among the
princes of</HI> Juda: <HI>for out of thee shall come a</HI> GOVERNOUR
THAT SHALL RULE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 4, 5.
So that all the disturbance at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which St. <HI>Mat∣thew</HI>
speaks of, was on account of the birth of a King
of the <HI>Jews.</HI> It is the same thing in <HI>Josephus.</HI> And the
<HI>chief priests</HI> and <HI>Scribes</HI> of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> were undoubtedly
of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> which are the persons so much spoken
of by <HI>Josephus.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> in <HI>Josephus</HI> has a character
of the Christ or Messias: <HI>for all things would be in his
power.</HI> Whether the jest upon <HI>Bagoas,</HI> and through
him upon the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> be of <HI>Josephus</HI>'s own invention;
or whether it was an old piece of wit in use among pro∣fane
people, to banter those who expected great things
from the Messias; or whether it be matter of fact, that
some of the <HI>Pharises</HI> did at that time give any such assu∣rances
to some person of influence in <HI>Judea,</HI> the better to
carry on selfish designs, I do not determine. But it is
an evidence, that the King, who was then the subject of
discourse, was supposed to be an extraordinary person.</P>
<P>In <HI>Josephus</HI> the <HI>Pharisees</HI> give out a prediction, that
<HI>God had decreed to put an end to</HI> Herod'<HI>s government,</HI> &amp;c.
This I take to be the same thing which <HI>the chief priests and
scribes</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Unde putas factum, ut eo ipso tempore, proximè post descrip∣tionem Judaicam Pharisaei vaticinia ista tractaret, &amp; pro lubitu suo interpretarentur? Numquid res ipsa testimonium perhibet Matthaei narrationi? Nonne audis magos ab oriente quaerentes, ubi natus sit Rex Judaeorum? Nonne Herodem sciscitantem a Pharisaeis, ubi Christus nasceretur? His enim occasionibus, his Herodis mandatis, Pharisaei ad Prophetarum libros remissi, vaticinia de quibus quaere∣batur prolata, ad placitum uxoris Pherorae, secretis colloquiis detor∣serunt. Kepler. de Anno Natal, Christ. cap. 12.</NOTE>: <HI>Thus it is written by the prophet,</HI> in St. <HI>Matthew:</HI>
<PB N="372" REF="390"/>
That is, what <HI>Josephus</HI> calls a <HI>prediction</HI> or <HI>pro∣phecy</HI>
of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> is no more than an interpretation
or application of an ancient prophecy. Thus <HI>Josephus</HI>
took upon himself the aire and character of a prophet,
when he applied the ancient <HI>jewish</HI> prophecies of the
Messias to <HI>Vespasian.</HI> He was taken prisoner by <HI>Vespa∣sian,</HI>
then General in <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Nero. Josephus,</HI> hear∣ing
that <HI>Vespasian</HI> had a design to send him to the Em∣peror,
desired he might speak with the General in pri∣vate.
Being brought before <HI>Vespasian,</HI> and all the com∣pany
being dismissed, except <HI>Titus</HI> and two friends, <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
begins: “You think, <HI>Vespasian,</HI> that you have
in <HI>Josephus</HI> a meer prisoner. But I am come to you
as a messenger of great things. Had I not been sent
to you by God, I knew what the law of the <HI>Jews</HI> is,
and how it becomes a General to die. Do you send
me to <HI>Nero?</HI> What! are they who are to succeed
<HI>Nero</HI> before you to continue? You <HI>Vespasian</HI> will be
<HI>Cesar:</HI> You, and this your son will be Emperour.
Bind me therefore still faster, and reserve me for your
self. For you shall be Lord not of me only, but of
the earth and the sea and all mankind. And for pu∣nishment
I deserve a closer confinement, if I now
speak falshood to you in the name of God<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. de Bell. l. iii. c. vii. §. 9.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>HOWEVER, beside the answer given by the <HI>Scribes</HI>
to <HI>Herod</HI>'s enquiry, we are to remember the speech
made by old <HI>Simeon,</HI> an eminent <HI>Pharisee,</HI> at the pre∣sentation
of Jesus at the temple; and that <HI>Anna</HI> a PRO∣PHETESSE
<HI>gave thanks unto the Lord, and spake of him to
all them that looked for redemption in</HI> Israel. And there
might be many other such like things said there by
Others; to all which <HI>Josephus,</HI> a Priest, and well inform∣ed
of what was said and done at the temple, may be
justly supposed to have a reference.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="391"/>
ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> says, that <HI>when</HI> Herod <HI>saw that he was</HI>
MOCKED <HI>of the wise men, he was</HI> EXCEEDING WROTH, <HI>and
sent forth, and slew all the children that were in</HI> Bethlehem,
<HI>and in all the coasts thereof. Josephus</HI> has given us the
tokens of an uncommon rage in <HI>Herod.</HI> And though St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> has related, upon this occasion, no other in∣stance
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s cruelty, beside the orders for destroying
the <HI>children</HI> in and near <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> yet nothing is more
likely, than that <HI>Herod,</HI> the most jealous of mortals,
should, upon the retreat of the wise men, be filled with
suspicions, that the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> whom he had
lately consulted about the birth-place of the King of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> had been accessory to the disappointment he had
met with from the said wise men: and that being heated
by the insinuations of his sister <HI>Salome</HI> (provided <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
has not brought her in here for the sake of a jest)
and by the barbarous counsels of his son <HI>Antipater,</HI> now
in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in high favour, he should then make also
that cruel ravage in his court and at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of which
our <HI>jewish</HI> historian has given us a summary account.</P>
<P>(3.) As I think, that <HI>Josephus</HI> was a very firm <HI>Jew;</HI>
so his indecent way of speaking of this affair is a strong
proof it relates to the transactions at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> af∣ter
the birth of Jesus. Is it not strange, that <HI>Josephus</HI>
should banter the <HI>Pharisees</HI> for pretending to the gift of
foreknowledge, when he himself, a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> has been
most notoriously guilty of it? I intend not only his speech
to <HI>Vespasian,</HI> just now transcribed. There are other, ra∣ther
more flagrant instances, and that in the history of
the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Bell. lib. iii. cap. 7. §. 3. vid. &amp; quae sequuntur Josephi ad Vespasianum alloquium, ibid. §. 9.</NOTE> <HI>jewish war,</HI> writ long before his <HI>Antiquities,</HI> in
which is the passage we are upon. His ridicule of the
<HI>Pharisees</HI> appears to me very unseasonable in an ac∣count
of such a scene of cruelty, and when they were
under very heavy sufferings? And for what? For re∣fusing
the oath of fidelity? No. They had escaped
with a <HI>fine</HI> for <HI>not swearing to</HI> Cesar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if there had
not followed some offenses more particularly against
<PB N="374" REF="392"/>
<HI>Herod,</HI> as is pretended. And what are these? Why pre∣dictions
and expectations, that the kingdome was by the
decree and appointment of God to be transferred to
some person not of <HI>Herod</HI>'s race: another instance of
agreement with the time that succeeded the birth of
Jesus, which, according to the Evangelists, was a time
of great expectation of a King predicted and prophesied
of. But here is not one riotous or seditious action men∣tioned
or hinted, the utmost is seditious words. And
yet <HI>Josephus</HI> justifies, triumphs in these terrible execu∣tions.
In a word, he, who uses to condemn <HI>Herod</HI> as a
man of an inhumane disposition, here treats the <HI>Pharisees</HI>
of this time with <HI>Herodian</HI> cruelty.</P>
<P>ALL this is absolutely unaccountable to me, but up∣on
the supposition, that this affair relates to the birth
of Jesus. Nor do I think, that I wrong <HI>Josephus</HI> in the
lest. It is to me more than probable, that every <HI>Jew,</HI>
who did not believe Jesus to be the Christ (as <HI>Josephus</HI>
did not) had a great deal of ill-will against him and all
his followers. That any <HI>Jew</HI> of those times should have
been long in a state of indifference upon this point, was
impossible.</P>
<P>IF it be said, that the predictions mentioned by <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
relate not to Jesus, but to <HI>Pheroras's wife, and
her children:</HI> I do not deny, but that she might pay a
regard to what the <HI>Pharisees</HI> said at this time, as well as
others did: but that she, or <HI>Pheroras,</HI> or any one is∣suing
from them was the person then discoursed of, and
the chief subject of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> predictions, I do not
believe, because it is inconsistent with the rest of <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>'s
story. If <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife had been the person
chiefly concerned in this affair, as <HI>Josephus</HI> pretends here;
would she have escaped with her life in so wide a scene of
cruelty, in which even the former favourites of <HI>Herod</HI>
were involved? If the dispositions of people ran now all
toward <HI>Pheroras</HI> and his wife, would <HI>Antipater</HI> have been
still great with them? Would <HI>Antipater,</HI> so desirous of
the crown, have gone away to <HI>Rome,</HI> as he did soon af∣ter
this execution, and leave-things in this posture?
<PB N="375" REF="393"/>
Would he, when he went away, leave securely in the
hands of <HI>Pheroras</HI> and his wife the work of poysoning his
father, and securing the succession for himself? Would
not <HI>Antipater,</HI> who had lately with exquisite artifice and
cruelty accomplished the death of his two brothers, sons
of <HI>Herod</HI> by <HI>Mariamne,</HI> have been able to effect the
raine of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife?</P>
<P>IT is true, after this execution was over, she was cal∣led
to account by <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it may not be insinuated, that I conceal any
difficulty, I will here give the reader <HI>Josephus</HI>'s words
which follow next after the long passage we are concern∣ed
with. “<HI>Herod</HI> having punished the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who
had been convicted of concerning themselves in this
affair, calls a council of his friends, and there accuses
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife: ascribing to her the affront that had
been offered to the virgins<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Virgins</HI>] The meaning is: <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife had been his servant. <HI>Herod</HI> had offered <HI>Pheroras</HI> one of his daughters, and after that, another. But <HI>Pheroras</HI> refused them both out of his affection for this woman.</NOTE>, and therein to him:
adding, that she did all she could to create a difference
between him and his brother; that the fine imposed
upon the <HI>Pharisees</HI> had been evaded by her means,
and that in the present affair nothing had been done
without her:—and that if <HI>Pheroras</HI> had any regard
for him, he would of his own accord put away his
wife. You will then, says he to <HI>Pheroras,</HI> be my bro∣ther
indeed, and we shall live<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 3. §. 1.</NOTE> together in friendship.”</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="394"/>
IF the meaning of the last words of the <HI>charge</HI> against
this woman be not, that in the <HI>present affair nothing had
been done without her,</HI> as I have rendered them, but that
<HI>Now a days nothing was done without her,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI>
translates them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Suisque impendiis evitata esset solutio mulctae ab ipso impositae, nihilque jam fine illa ageretur.</NOTE>; then her conduct in the late affair
is not so much as made any particular crime, but is on∣ly
comprehended in a general charge of an over busy
intriguing temper.</P>
<P>BUT let it be granted that <HI>Josephus</HI> says, her conduct
in this affair was an express charge in <HI>Herod</HI>'s accusation;
yet the punishment proposed confutes the supposition,
that she was the main agent in this concern. <HI>Herod</HI> as∣sures
<HI>Pheroras,</HI> they two should be very good friends, if
this woman were but <HI>put away.</HI> Would this disgrace
have satisfied <HI>Herod,</HI> if, beside many other provocations,
she had now been the Principal in a crime, for which
many accessories, and those in all other respects very
acceptable persons, had been punished with death? I
hope we may be allowed not to credit <HI>Josephus</HI> in a cir∣cumstance
so inconsistent with the rest of his account.
And I think, it is not hard to guesse, why <HI>Josephus</HI>
gave some false turns in this story.</P>
<P>I HAVE one thing more to desire of the reader, that is,
that he will be pleased to consider, whether <HI>Josephus</HI> does
not contradict himself in the main passage, in which he is
so merry. He tells us at first, that the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in re∣quital
for the kindnesse shewed to them, foretold, that
God had decreed to transfer the kingdome to <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s
<HI>wife, and</HI> Pheroras, <HI>and their children:</HI> But at the end,
it is <HI>the King, who was to be appointed according to their
prediction.</HI> How comes <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s <HI>wife, and</HI> Pheroras,
<HI>and their children</HI> to be all a <HI>King?</HI> Or how came the
<HI>King</HI> to be all them? If the reader can reconcile these
things together, it will be very well. But if he cannot,
perhaps he will allow, that here are some things said of
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> without foundation. I
ever take it, that inconsistences are a certain sign, that
<PB N="377" REF="395"/>
an historian has not confined himself barely to matter of
fact, but has indulged his fansy, or his passions, and
gon into fiction.</P>
<P>FOR these reasons then I think, that the <HI>Oath</HI> in <HI>Jo∣sephus,</HI>
taken by all the <HI>jewish</HI> nation, is the same thing
with the taxing or enrolment mention'd by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> And
I think, that this oath refers to a census made in <HI>Judea,</HI>
for the following reasons. In a census the people gave
in an account of themselves and their estates upon <HI>oath.</HI>
It seems to me very probable that a census was made,
or at lest ordered by <HI>Augustus,</HI> during the time that
<HI>Herod</HI> lay under his displeasure. Under the former par∣ticular
I shewed, that <HI>Herod</HI> had been, before this, a
tributary prince. His great subjection appears likewise
in the difference between him and <HI>Obodas.</HI> He was o∣bliged
to refer the matter in dispute to the Emperour's
officers in <HI>Syria.</HI> After <HI>Obodas</HI> had broke the stipula∣tions,
<HI>Herod</HI> did not dare to move his forces without the
consent of the before-mentioned officers. And <HI>Augustus,</HI>
supposing that he had done so, was very angry, and
threatens, that whereas he had <HI>hitherto used him as a
friend, he should for the future treat him as a subject.</HI> These
words are undoubtedly proper and expressive words. If
<HI>Herod,</HI> when a <HI>friend</HI> of <HI>Augustus,</HI> was in such subjection;
what can the treating as a <HI>subject</HI> mean, but the reducing
him to the lowest state of dependent princes? which
seems to be that of obliging them to submit to a census,
and then raising tribute in their dominions according
to it.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says, that after the receit of this letter
from <HI>Augustus, Herod</HI> sent in vain two ambassies to
<HI>Rome,</HI> that the state of <HI>Judea</HI> grew worse and worse, that
<HI>Herod</HI> was obliged to submit to many disgraces. The
Emperour's displeasure against <HI>Herod</HI> was manifest there∣fore,
not at <HI>Rome</HI> only, but in all the countries about
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) BUT it may be objected, that <HI>Josephus</HI> has no
where said, that there was any enrolment of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
much less that there was a proper census made in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="396"/>
TO this I answer, that it is apparent, there was an
enrolment and numbring of the people. How else
should all the people have taken an oath, except <HI>six thou∣sand
Pharisees?</HI> Did they not enter the people that took
the oath? If they did not, how should it have been
known who swore and who did not?</P>
<P>NOR can it be inferred there was no enrolment or cen∣sus,
because <HI>Josephus</HI> has not expressly said there was. <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>'s
account of this matter is very slight and defective.
If it had not been for some things which followed after
the oath, and had some connexion with it, it seems that
he would have taken no notice of it at all. An oath had
been taken by all the <HI>jewish</HI> nation to <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI>
and great exactnesse had been observed in relation to it.
The numbers and characters of those which had refused
were known. This was an affair of importance, and
deserved a much more particular account than he has
given us. And we are allowed to suppose some things,
not expressed, which must necessarily have been conco∣mitants
of it.</P>
<P>I DO not pretend to assign positively the reasons of
his slight mention of this affair. But I apprehend, I
can give some probable account of it. <HI>Herod</HI>'s subjects
were all enrolled in a census, but there was no tribute
demanded upon it. <HI>Herod</HI> had great dexterity, or very
good fortune in surmounting the difficulties he met with
in the several parts of his life. He was himself a man of
a great genius, and some of his servants were men of
great abilities. <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI> in particular was
eminent for learning and addresse. And <HI>Herod</HI> knew
very well how to bestow a present or a bribe.</P>
<P>I AM moreover the rather inclined to think, that
no tax was raised upon this census; because it appears
that after these troubles, of which <HI>Josephus</HI> has given
us an account, <HI>Augustus</HI> was in a great measure recon∣ciled
to <HI>Herod.</HI> Perceiving that his resentment against
<HI>Herod</HI> had been very much founded upon aspersions, he
might be disposed to forbear exacting the tribute upon
the census, and to let things go on in the old way. Then
<PB N="379" REF="397"/>
<HI>Herod</HI> had taken care, that the decree had been obeyed
and executed in his dominions without disturbance: all
had sworn or enrolled themselves, except <HI>six thousand
Pharisees,</HI> and they were fined.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Herod</HI> was now an old man, and had
many sons. It was therefore very likely, there would
be some partition made of his dominions at his death.
And <HI>Augustus</HI> might be very willing there should be so.
Three or four little princes are better governed than
one that is powerful. Tribute could not be paid ac∣cording
to this census any longer than the several parts
of the kingdome continued united in one person. When
it came to be divided or parcelled out, a new census
would be necessary.</P>
<P>IF then no tribute was paid upon this census, an hi∣storian
could the more easily pass it by without a parti∣cular
description, especially since it had been finished
without any popular tumults.</P>
<P>IT may be inferred from the manner in which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
mentions this survey, that it was not very much taken
notice of. If it had been universally known, there
had been hardly any occasion, upon the mention of a
decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> in the reign of <HI>Herod</HI> to enroll all the
land, to subjoin a parenthesis, the chief intent of which
seems to be to distinguish this from another that hap∣pened
not till after the removal of <HI>Herod</HI>'s successor.</P>
<P>IF this census was not universally known when <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
wrote, he might be well pleased to touch upon it
slightly. The <HI>jewish</HI> writers were very forward to enu∣merate
the honours done to their people by the Roman
Senate, or the chief men of the Commonwealth, or the
Emperours afterwards; the better to gain some regard
among other nations, by whom they were generally
despised and hated. But as for any disgraces they re∣ceived
from the <HI>Romans,</HI> the case was very different.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Josephus</HI> has mentioned many favours confer∣red
on the <HI>Jews</HI> by <HI>Julius Cesar, Augustus, Livia, Mar∣cus
Agrippa, Claudius,</HI> and other <HI>Romans:</HI> but yet he
says nothing of the Journey which <HI>Caius, Augustus</HI>'s
<PB N="380" REF="398"/>
eldest adopted son, made through <HI>Judea,</HI> in the begin∣ning
of the reign of <HI>Archelaus.</HI> This we have from<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sed &amp; Caium Nepotem, quod Judaeam praetervehens apud Hi∣rosolymam non supplicasset, collaudavit [Augustus]. Suet. in Aug. c. 93.</NOTE>
<HI>Suetonius</HI> only, an author very little concerned in <HI>jewish</HI>
affairs. The reason seems to be, that <HI>Caius</HI> offered no
sacrifice at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nor made any present to the tem∣ple,
which was deemed a piece of contempt shewn to
their religion.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, <HI>Josephus</HI> found but a slender account of
this transaction in the History of <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI>
from which he took his materials for this reign. Tho'
<HI>Nicolas</HI> was no <HI>Jew,</HI> yet he was a great friend and flatter∣er
of <HI>Herod:</HI> and it could not but be an ungrateful task
to him, after that he had in the former part of his work
drawn his master as a great genius, a founder of cities,
and friend of <HI>Augustus,</HI> to describe at last so disagreeable
a scene as that of one of the Emperour's officers enrol∣ling
all the subjects of his dominions.</P>
<P><HI>NICOLAS</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 5. §. 3.</NOTE> had great intimacies with <HI>Herod.
Josephus</HI> has affirmed more than once, that he was a
great flatterer<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. l. xiv. c. 1. §. 3.</NOTE> of him. And in one place says
particularly, “that living in his kingdome and to∣gether
with him he composed his history with a view
to please the King and advance his interest, touching
upon those things only which made for<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. 16. c. 7. §. 1.</NOTE> his ho∣nour.”
This enrolment, even though it was not a pro∣per
assessement, but only an entry of the names of all
the people, their age and condition, accompanied with
an oath of strict fidelity to the Emperour, must have
been the greatest mortification of <HI>Herod</HI>'s whole life:
and from the character of <HI>Nicolas,</HI> just set down, it may
be concluded almost with certainty, that he did not give
a particular account of this affair. Nor had <HI>Josephus</HI>
any inducements to supply his defects in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="399"/>
(2.) BUT it will be said, that the silence of <HI>Josephus</HI>
is not the only difficulty: there is in him well nigh po∣sitive
proof, that there had been no census or enrolment
made in <HI>Judea</HI> before the removal of <HI>Archelaus.</HI> For
upon the occasion of this, he says: “Moreover <HI>Cyreni∣us</HI>
came into <HI>Judea,</HI> it being annexed to the province
of <HI>Syria,</HI> to make an assessement of their goods, and
seise <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s estate. The <HI>Jews</HI> were at first very
much moved at the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 18. c. 1. §. 1.</NOTE> mention of the enrolments,
but by degrees they were brought to acquiesce at the
perswasion of <HI>Joazar</HI> the High Priest.” He observes
also, “that at this time <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Gaulanite</HI> excited them
to a rebellion, telling them that a census would intro∣duce
downright<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> slavery.” It will be said: It may
be hence inferred, that there had been no enrolments
made before: if there had, they could not have been so
frightful now.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that there must have been an enrolment
made, when the oath mentioned by <HI>Josephus</HI> was taken:
And that oath was likewise an express and solemn ac∣knowledgement
of subjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, though this <HI>oath</HI> had been quite omitted
by <HI>Josephus,</HI> it would not have followed, that there had
been no enrolment made before this time in <HI>Judea.</HI> Peo∣ple
are not always of the same temper. <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI>
now broached or revived the principle, that they ought
to obey none but God: and for some reasons it was re∣ceived
with great applause, spread and gained ground.
But the <HI>Jews</HI> must have been more submissive, when
they all took the oath to <HI>Cesar,</HI> except six thousand.
And after <HI>Herod</HI> was dead, there was a very numerous
ambassy sent to <HI>Rome</HI> in the name of the whole <HI>jewish</HI>
nation, entreating, that instead of being governed by
any of <HI>Herod</HI>'s descendents, “they<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Jos. Ant. 17. p. 784. v. 35.</NOTE> might be annexed
<PB N="382" REF="400"/>
to the Province of <HI>Syria,</HI> and be subject to Praetors
sent from thence, promising likewise a most quiet and
peaceable behaviour under such a government.”</P>
<P>IN another place <HI>Josephus</HI> represents <HI>Judas</HI>'s argu∣ments
in these terms: “And at this time a certain man,
called <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> excited the people to re∣bellion,
telling them, they had a mean spirit if they
could endure to pay tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and ack∣nowledge
mortal men for their Lords;—after God
had been their King<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. lib. ii. cap. 8. §. 1.</NOTE>.” It might be as well infer∣red
from what <HI>Judas</HI> says here, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had never
before paid tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> or been subject to
mortal Lords, as from what he says in the other place,
that they had never before been enrolled. I presume it
need not be proved, that they had been subject, before
this, to <HI>mortal Lords.</HI> I think too, that I have shewn,
they had been tributary to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the reign of
<HI>Herod.</HI> They had likewise paid tribute to the <HI>Romans</HI>
before <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign: For <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Cassius</HI>
“imposed a heavy tribute upon the people <HI>[in Syria</HI>].
And in particular bore very hard upon <HI>Judea,</HI> exact∣ing
of them seven hundred talents of silver<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. lib. 14. cap. xi. §. 2.</NOTE>.”
This sum was laid in several portions upon the several
parts of <HI>Judea;</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Galilee</HI>
under <HI>Hyrcanus,</HI> brought in his quota the first, and
thereby very much obliged <HI>Cassius. Judas</HI>'s speech
therefore is no proof, that there had been no enrolment
or census made in <HI>Judea</HI> before the removal of <HI>Ar∣chellaus.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) I CAN think of but one difficulty more. Per∣haps
some will say, my argument is defective, and that
in order to make it out, that this <HI>oath,</HI> taken by the
<HI>Jews,</HI> in <HI>Josephus,</HI> was a census, I ought to produce
some passages of an ancient writer, in which a census is
<PB N="383" REF="401"/>
called an <HI>Oath,</HI> or the act or the people enrolling them∣selves
in a census is expressed by <HI>taking an oath.</HI> I own
then, that I have not any such example by me. How∣ever,
I would offer here two or three considerations.</P>
<P>[1.] IN a Roman census the people gave in their ac∣count
of themselves and their estates upon oath. And that
oath, as represented by <HI>Dionysius,</HI> has a very near re∣semblance
with the words of <HI>Josephus. Dionysius</HI> says,
the people were commanded to <HI>take an oath to give in a
true account, according to the best of their knowledge:</HI> and
<HI>Josephus</HI> says, that the whole <HI>jewish</HI> nation engaged by an
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">THERE is another thing which may deserve notice. <HI>Diony∣sius</HI> says, That the penalty at <HI>Rome</HI> for not enrolling in a census was loss of estate and citizenship. Perhaps the <HI>fine</HI> imposed on the <HI>Phari∣sees,</HI> who refused to swear, was now ordered in conformity to the Roman Customs upon like occasions. For <HI>Herod</HI> had been wont be∣fore to inflict punishments of another kind for refusing to swear fidelity to him. Antiq. 15. c. 10. §. 4.</NOTE> oath to <HI>be faithful</HI> Cesar <HI>and the interests of the King.</HI></P>
<P>[2.] WE have in the ancient writers very few accounts
of assessements made in provinces. The Roman histo∣rians
scarce ever take any notice of them, but when
they were attended with some disturbances which made
them remarkable. As we have but very few writers of
those times, especially such as lived in the provinces, it
is not to be wondered that we meet with some singular
phrases in those we have, and which we cannot paral∣lel
in any other authors now in our hands. If we had
before us the works of a good number of provincial
writers, it is not unlikely, but we might see some of
them represent their nation enrolling themselves in a
census, especially in the first census made in their coun∣try,
by the taking an <HI>oath</HI> of allegiance and fidelity to
the Emperour. I shall give an instance from <HI>Josephus,</HI>
which has likewise some affinity with our subject. In
the <HI>jewish</HI> war he calls <HI>Fabatus Cesar</HI>'s Procurator<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. l. I. cap. 29. p. 1030. v. 22. vid. &amp; v. 29.</NOTE>:
In his <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 17. cap. 3. p. 755. v. 6.</NOTE> he calls him <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Servant. He
<PB N="384" REF="402"/>
also calls one <HI>Stephen,</HI> who was in <HI>Judea</HI> in the time of
<HI>Cumanus, Cesar</HI>'s servant. “And<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 20. cap. 4. §. 4. vid. &amp; de Bell. p. 1072. v. 32.</NOTE> at this time, <HI>says
he,</HI> some who aimed at innovations set upon <HI>Stephen</HI> a
servant of <HI>Cesar,</HI> in the High-way about a hundred
stadia from the city, and robbed him of all he had.”
I have shewn above, that <HI>Fabatus</HI> was <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Procu∣rator
in the Kingdom of <HI>Arabia,</HI> if not also in <HI>Judea,</HI>
And that <HI>Stephen</HI> also was Procurator in <HI>Judea,</HI> may
be concluded from the treasure he had with him, and
from his being particularly the object of the spite of the
seditious <HI>Jews,</HI> who were uneasy under the Roman go∣vernment.
So that, with <HI>Josephus,</HI> the <HI>Emperour's ser∣vant</HI>
and the <HI>procurator of the Emperour's revenue</HI> were
synonymous terms. If <HI>Josephus</HI> appears at present sin∣gular
in this stile, yet I doubt not, but it was at that
time very common.</P>
<P>[3.] I APPREHEND, that though the <HI>Jews</HI> entered
themselves and their estates in the way of a Roman cen∣sus,
yet there was no tribute raised upon it: Which
might be the reason <HI>of Josephus</HI>'s representing this affair
simply by taking an oath, rather than by the name of
a census.</P>
<P>I HAVE now laid before the reader the evidence I
have for this supposition, that there was a census made
in <HI>Judea</HI> a little before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> The par∣ticulars
mentioned by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and the expressions he
uses, are very suitable to a census. And the posture of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s affairs about this time incline me to think there
was an enrolment, after the manner of a Roman cen∣sus,
made in his dominions by order of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT whether I am in the right or not, St. <HI>Luke</HI> cer∣tainly
says, that there was an enrolment: And <HI>Josephus</HI>
says, that the whole <HI>jewish</HI> nation had taken an oath to
be faithful to <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Herod.</HI> Some entry therefore
must have been made. And if St. <HI>Luke</HI> be understood
<PB N="385" REF="403"/>
to speak only of an enrolment of names and persons,
his account is confirmed by <HI>Josephus</HI> as fully as one
could wish.</P>
<P>AND though it should be thought, that I have not
fully proved, that there was at this time a proper as∣sessement
made in <HI>Judea;</HI> yet I have, I think, shewn
undeniably, that about this time that country was
brought into a very strict subjection to <HI>Augustus:</HI> And
herein also St. <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI> agree entirely.</P>
<P>I AM sensible that they, who have hitherto supposed,
that Jesus was not born till a few weeks before the death
of <HI>Herod,</HI> will very unwillingly allow, that the oath in
<HI>Josephus</HI> has any relation to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s enrolment. But
then, beside the task of evading all the many concur∣ring
circumstances in St. <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Josephus,</HI> they will
labour under one very great difficulty. For this oath
appears to have been taken by the <HI>Jews</HI> so very near
the end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, that it will be utterly incon∣ceiveable,
that the <HI>Romans</HI> should have ordered another
general enrolment, and harasse the people again before
<HI>Herod</HI>'s death. Nor will they be able to remove this
difficulty by saying, that the <HI>swearing began</HI> about the
time it is placed in by <HI>Josephus,</HI> but was not finish'd till a
few weeks before <HI>Herod</HI> died: For it was all over at the
time <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of it. All had taken the oath, but
six thousand <HI>Pharisees;</HI> they had refused, and were fined.</P>
<P>§. III. THE third objection is this: <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not
Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> till nine or ten, perhaps twelve
years after our Saviour was born: therefore St. <HI>Luke</HI>
has made a mistake in saying, that this taxing happen∣ed
in the time of <HI>Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>THIS objection must now be stated more at length.
In our translation the words are: <HI>And this taxing was
first made when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria. What
is the sense of our translation, I do not know: and it
must be owned likewise, that the words of the Origi∣nal
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> seem to have in them an uncommon ambiguity.
<PB N="386" REF="404"/>
Many think, the most genuine natural sense of the origi∣nal
words is: <HI>This first taxing</HI> [or enrolment] <HI>was made,
when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria. Upon this sense
of them the objection is founded. And it is urged, this
cannot be agreeable to the truth. For the Evangelists
have assured us, that Jesus was born in the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s, reign. But <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. 17. cap. v §. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Quintilius
Varus</HI> was then president of <HI>Syria,</HI> and he must have
been so at lest a year before <HI>Herod</HI> died. And <HI>Saturninus</HI>
was his predecessor. Moreover <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Cy∣renius</HI>
was sent Governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> when <HI>Archelaus</HI>
was removed from his government of <HI>Judea,</HI> who yet
reigned there between nine and ten years after <HI>Herod.
Josephus</HI> relates this matter, in his <HI>Antiquities,</HI> thus:</P>
<P>“BUT in the tenth year<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s govern∣ment,
the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans</HI> not being
able to bear his cruelty and tyranny accused him to <HI>Cesar.</HI>
The Emperor sent an officer into <HI>Judea</HI> to bring him
to <HI>Rome.</HI> When he came thither, <HI>Cesar,</HI> having heard
what he had to say in answer to his accusers, banished
him, appointing <HI>Vienna</HI> a city in <HI>Gaul</HI> for the place of
his abode<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. 17. c. 15. §. 2.</NOTE>. And the country of <HI>Archelaus</HI> being
annexed to the province of <HI>Syria, Cyrenius</HI> a Consular
person was sent by <HI>Cesar</HI> to make an assessement in <HI>Sy∣ria,</HI>
and to seiss <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s estate<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS he says: “ In the mean time <HI>Cyre∣nius</HI>
a Roman Senator, who had served all other offices,
and through them arrived at the Consulship, and was
distinguished likewise by divers other honours and dig∣nities,
came into <HI>Syria</HI> with a few troops, being sent
thither by <HI>Cesar</HI> to administer justice to that people, and
to make an assessement of their goods. And <HI>Coponius</HI>
a person of the <HI>Equestrian</HI> rank was sent with him to
govern in <HI>Judea</HI> with supreme authority. <HI>Cyrenius</HI>
<PB N="387" REF="405"/>
also came into <HI>Judea,</HI> now annexed to <HI>Syria,</HI> both
to assesse their estates, and to seise <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s effects
and treasure<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 18. c. I. §. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is objected therefore, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has commit∣ted
a very grosse mistake, in saying, that <HI>this taxing
was made when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria: since
it appears from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not president
of that province till after the banishment of <HI>Archelaus,
Herod</HI>'s son and successor.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that though the sense of the words,
as they now stand in St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Gospel, should be sup∣posed
inconsistent with this account taken from <HI>Josephus;</HI>
yet it would be unreasonable to conclude, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
had really made any mistake. St. <HI>Luke</HI> appears in the
rest of his history, and from many particulars of this ac∣count
before us, to be so fully master of the state of <HI>Ju∣dea,</HI>
and of the nature of this affair he is here speaking
of, that it is impossible he should commit any such
mistake.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of his third chapter He has most
exactly specified the state of all <HI>Judea,</HI> or the land of
<HI>Israel,</HI> as it was in the fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> by set∣ting
down the several Tetrarchs and Governours of it,
and the true extent of their territories.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> understood the nature of enrolments, as
made by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The enrolment now made, was by
virtue of a Decree of <HI>Augustus.</HI> And he says that <HI>Joseph
went to be taxed with</HI> Mary <HI>his espoused wife.</HI> This was
the custom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as has been shewed from un∣doubted
testimonies, to enrole <HI>women</HI> as well as men;
whereas the <HI>Jews</HI> used to number or enrole <HI>Males</HI> only.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="406"/>
MOREOVER, St. <HI>Luke</HI> appears to be well acquaint∣ed
with the census which <HI>Josephus</HI> gives us an account of.
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> says: <HI>After this man rose up</HI> Judas <HI>of</HI> Galilee,
<HI>in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people
after him: he also perished, and as many as obeyed him,
were dispersed,</HI> Acts v. 37. I think it may be fairly sup∣posed,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> understood what he has related
from <HI>Gamaliel.</HI> And then, here are particulars enough
to satisfie us, he wanted no information concerning the
census which <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Gamaliel</HI> here speaks of the census made in
<HI>Judea</HI> after the banishment of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> is evident, be∣cause
it was at that time, that <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> raised a
disturbance. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> calls them <HI>the days of the taxing,</HI>
which implies, that this was a very noted and remarka∣ble
period: as it is certain, it was.</P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> here calls this <HI>Judas</HI> by his proper
name. <HI>Josephus</HI> does in one place call him <HI>Judas Gaula∣nites</HI>
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 18. c. I. p. 792. v. 3.</NOTE>, but he often stiles him <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> or
of <HI>Galilee</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> p. 1060. 8</NOTE>. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> says, that he <HI>drew away much
people after him. Josephus</HI> says the same thing of him in
almost the same words<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. l. vii. p. 1313. v. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> does exactly specifie the time in which
this man <HI>rose up,</HI> namely in <HI>the time of the taxing,</HI> or of
the enrolment: for <HI>Josephus</HI> says, “ he perswaded not
a few not to enrole themselves, when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> the Cen∣sor
was sent into <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &amp; p. 792. init.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> says, <HI>he also perished, and all, even
as many as obeyed him, were scattered. Josephus</HI> has no
where related particularly the end of this <HI>Judas.</HI> But
that his enterprize was defeated at that time, we may
be certain. otherwise the Roman Government could
not have subsisted in that country with any quiet, which
yet it did for near sixty years after the banishment of
<PB N="389" REF="407"/>
<HI>Archelaus.</HI> Nor is there after this any mention made,
in <HI>Josephus</HI>'s history, of any action or attempt of <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be here objected, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s
words imply, that this design of <HI>Judas</HI> was quite con∣founded,
and his principles sunk at once: And yet it
seems likely from the uneasinesse which the <HI>Jews</HI> express
under the Roman tribute in some places of the Evange∣lists,
that his principles were in being long afterwards:
And from <HI>Josephus</HI> it appears, that his notions were ve∣ry
prevalent, and were one cause of their war at last
with the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if any so understand <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> they appear to
me very much to mistake the design of his Argument.
Doubtless it was not without special reason that <HI>Gama∣liel</HI>
alleged these two instances. And he speaks of each
in a very different manner. Of <HI>Theudas</HI> he says: <HI>He
was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered
and brought to nought</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] They
were ruined and came to nothing. Of <HI>Judas</HI> he says:
<HI>He also perished, and all, as many obeyed him, were dis∣persed</HI>
[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]. Having mentioned these two
instances, which the council were well acquainted with,
and hereby laid a foundation for the advice he proposed
to give, he goes on: <HI>And now I say unto you, refrain
from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or
this work be of men,</HI> [as <HI>Theudas</HI>'s was] <HI>it will come to</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought</HI> [as his did]. <HI>But if it be of God, ye cannot over∣throw
it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be supposed, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI> should ex∣presily
say: <HI>Judas</HI>'s design was <HI>of God.</HI> However the
chief men of the <HI>jewish</HI> nation might approve his princi∣ples,
they were wiser than openly to espouse them: they
lest that to the common people.</P>
<P>THE force of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s argument is this: <HI>Theudas</HI>
and his measures came to nothing. After him <HI>Judas</HI> rose
up: He himself perished, and his people were dispersed;
but yet his principles prevail. You likewise may now
punish these men, and put an end to their lives; but if
<PB N="390" REF="408"/>
their principles be of God, they will prevail notwith∣standing;
and all the issue will be, that you will con∣tract
guilt, fight against God, but in vain.</P>
<P>AND to this seems to be owing the great successe of
<HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s reasoning, and the service he did the Apostles
at this time. He insinuates some hopes, that their de∣sign
might be of the same nature with <HI>Judas</HI>'s. This
maybe inferred from his way of expressing himself: <HI>lest
haply ye be found to fight against God.</HI> This was <HI>Judas</HI>'s
peculiar principle, that they were to own no mortal
Lords, but God only<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jos. p. 1060. v. 10.</NOTE> And it is not unlikely, that
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> intended hereby to insinuate, not only that
there was danger of their opposing a design which came
from God, and of opposing it with no other effect, but
that of contracting guilt to themselves, but also of op∣posing
the very kingdom and government of God,
which they wished to be under.</P>
<P>IT deserves likewise to be observed, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI>
mentions <HI>Theudas</HI> with contempt and indignation. <HI>Be∣fore
these days rose up</HI> Theudas, <HI>boasting himself to be some∣body:</HI>
but nothing like this follows the mention of <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> concludes upon the whole, that they
should <HI>let these men alone.</HI> We have no occasion to med∣dle
in this matter. It is not unlikely but the <HI>Romans,</HI>
our present Governours, will be jealous of these men.
But it seems to me an affair we have no reason to con∣cern
our selves in.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> therefore must be supposed to be well ac∣quainted
with the census made after the banishment of
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST be permitted to observe farther, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
does here call <HI>Cyrenius</HI> by his true name. It has indeed
been a dispute among learned men, whether his Roman
name was <HI>Quirinus</HI> or <HI>Quirinius. Onuphrius</HI> in his <HI>Fasti</HI>
printed it <HI>Quirinus: Grotius</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">In Luc. ii. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>Lipsius</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In not. ad Tacit. ann. l. iii. c. 48.</NOTE> thought
<HI>Onuphrius</HI> was mistaken, and that it ought to be correc∣ted
<HI>Quirinius.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dissert. de Aug. orb Teir. Deser. §. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Perizonius</HI> seems to have proved, that
<PB N="391" REF="409"/>
<HI>Quirinus</HI> is the true way of writing it in <HI>Latin:</HI> since it
was not the family name, or the <HI>nomen,</HI> but <HI>cognomen,</HI>
the third name of this Gentleman. For his name was
<HI>Caius Sulpicius Quirinus;</HI> and in the <HI>Syriac</HI> version of
St. <HI>Luke</HI> he is written <HI>Curinus,</HI> and in the <HI>Latin</HI> vulgate
<HI>Cyrinus.</HI> But however that be, he allows it to be com∣mon
for the <HI>Greeks</HI> to make some alteration in the ter∣mination
of Roman names, when they turn them into
their own language. It is certain his name in all the <HI>Greek</HI>
authors has the termination of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orius. Strabo</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lib. xii. p. 854.</NOTE> and <HI>Dio</HI>
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dio. lib. liv. ad A. U. 742.</NOTE> call him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> [<HI>Cyrinius</HI>]. But in <HI>Josephus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 791. v. 5. 12. p. 794. v. 21, 37. &amp; alibi.</NOTE>
his name is always written, as in St. <HI>Luke, Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, it is certain, <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour
of <HI>Syria;</HI> and he has here a very proper title, by which
he must have been well known in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in all that
part of the world.</P>
<P>LASTLY, if we consider that the words now before
us are a parenthesis, and that St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls the enrol∣ment
or census he was speaking of, the <HI>first,</HI> we cannot
well doubt, but that the original intention of them was,
in some manner or other, to distinguish this enrolment,
which was now made in the reign of <HI>Herod,</HI> from that,
which was afterwards made when <HI>Archelaus</HI> was ba∣nished.</P>
<P>HE that will seriously consider all these particulars,
will have no suspicions, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has made any
mistake.</P>
<P>IF then the sense, which is now ordinarily given these
words, is not consisent with truth, it is highly reasona∣ble
to conclude, that either we do not take the true
meaning of them, or else that some small alteration or
other has happened in the text of St, <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>§. IV. BUT though what has been here offered, and
which has also been in the main alleged before by those
who have considered this place, be sufficient to take
away the force of this objection; yet I presume, it will
<PB N="392" REF="410"/>
be expected, I should give some account of the particu∣lar
solutions that have been offered by learned men. This
I shall do, and then endeavour to support or improve
that which appears to me the fairest.</P>
<P>1. ONE solution proposed by<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> <HI>Calvin,</HI> and much
approved by <HI>Salmeron</HI> and <HI>Baronius,</HI> is, that <HI>Josephus</HI>
was mistaken in the account which he has given of <HI>Cy∣renius.</HI>
The two last mentioned writers especially are
of opinion, that we need pay little regard to <HI>Josephus,</HI>
whose history, they. say, abounds with mistakes and
falshoods<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Praestat ut Josephi verò fidem &amp; historiam de∣seramas, tanquam incertam, &amp; fluctuantem &amp; veritati in multis dissen∣tientem. Salmeron in Evang. T. iii. Tractat. 32.</NOTE> And <HI>Baronius</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sicque contra Josephi deliria certo appareret, sub Augusto impentore, vivente Herode seniore, reperiri duplicem, immo triplicem Quirinii in Syria praefecturam. Baron. Ann. A. D. 3. Vid. &amp; app. ad An. num. 80-86.</NOTE> has taken some pains
to make out a new series of the succession of the Gover∣nours
of <HI>Syria</HI> about this time. For he thinks, that
<HI>Cyrenius</HI> was twice, if not thrice, president of <HI>Syria.</HI>
But this project can be but little approved by learned
men at present. No one that reads <HI>Josephus</HI> without pre∣judice,
and that considers he had before him the history
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s, reign writ by <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI> who was
a learned man, <HI>Herod</HI>'s favourite, and employed by
him in affairs of government, can make any doubt, but
that <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> when <HI>He∣rod</HI>
died; that C. <HI>Sentius Saturninus</HI> was his predecessor,
and was in the province at lest two or three years; and
that <HI>M. Titius</HI> was president before him. With all
these Governours of <HI>Syria Herod</HI> had some concerns.
What <HI>Josephus</HI> has said of them may likewise be con∣firmed
in a great measure from other authors<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Noris. Cenot. Pis. Diss. ii. cap. 16. § 9, 10.</NOTE> So
thas there is no room for <HI>Cyrenius</HI> at thistime.</P>
<P>NOR can there well be any question made, but that
<HI>Josephus</HI> has given us, in the main, a true account of
the enrolment or census made by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Arche∣laus</HI>'s
banishment. It appears from the manner, in
which <HI>Gamaliel</HI> speaks of the <HI>taxing</HI> when <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Gali∣lee</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="411"/>
rose up, that this was a remarkable event. And the
account <HI>Josephus</HI> gives of it may assure us, this was an
affair all men were then well acquainted with. The di∣sturbance raised by <HI>Judas</HI> was suppressed, but yet the
principle subsisted. It was the occasion of much uneasi∣nesse
under the Roman government, and many were at
times punished on account of it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jos Ant. l. xviii. cap. I. §. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. ANOTHER solution proposed by <HI>Calvin</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra.</NOTE> and
which <HI>Valesius</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vid. Notas ad Euseb. Hist. Ec. lib. i. cap. 5.</NOTE> judges to be the mod commodious of
any, is, that the decree of <HI>Augustus</HI> was issued in the lat∣ter
end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign; but that for some reason or
other the census could not be made, or at left not fi∣nished till the time that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria,</HI>
ten or twelve years afterwards.</P>
<P>BUT this is to make St. <HI>Luke</HI> speak very improperly
and confusedly, of what he says of <HI>Cyrenius.</HI> And it
is directly contrary to what follows. Having related,
that there <HI>went out a decree from</HI> Cesar Augustus, <HI>that
all the world should be taxed,</HI> he subjoins: <HI>and all went to
be taxed exery one in his own city.</HI> And there was so great
a resort at this time at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> upon this account, that
<HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> were obliged to take up with very in∣different
accommodations: <HI>there was no room for them in
the inn.</HI></P>
<P>3. SOME think that instead of <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> we ought
to read <HI>Saturninus;</HI> because, according to <HI>Josephus,</HI> he
was Prefect of <HI>Syria,</HI> within a year or two before <HI>Herod</HI>
died; and <HI>Tertullian</HI> says this census was made by him.
This is one of the solutions proposed by<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra.</NOTE> <HI>Valesius,</HI>
though he rather approves that last mentioned. But
against this, it has been observed by many learned men,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> is in all our copies of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and appears
to have been there before <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s time; since <HI>Justin
Martyr</HI> says expressly, that this census was made by
<HI>Cyrenius,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="412"/>
4, OTHER, learned<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Huet.</HI> Dem. Evang. Prop. ix. c. x, <HI>Parker</HI> Dem. of the truth of the Christ. Religion, p. 219. 4 to. 1681.</NOTE> men have thought it a very
easy and probable conjecture, that originally the name
in St. <HI>Luke</HI> was <HI>Quintilius. Quintilius. Varus</HI> succeeded
<HI>Saturninus,</HI> and was in the province of <HI>Syria,</HI> when <HI>He∣rod</HI>
died. The census afterwards made by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was
certainly bed known, and some ignorant transcriber
might therefore imagine <HI>Quintilius</HI> a mistake, and pre∣tend
to correct the original by inserting <HI>Cyrenius</HI> in his
room. Besides, the alteration of <HI>Quintilius</HI> to <HI>Cyrenius,</HI>
is a change of only a few<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> letters, and therefore
might the more easily happen.</P>
<P>BUT this solution is liable to the same objection with
the former, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> is in all the copies of the
<HI>Greek</HI> original, and in all the ancient versions. And
besides, has this disadvantage, that this census St. <HI>Luke</HI>
speaks of is not ascribed to <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> by any anci∣ent
Christian writer whatever, whereas <HI>Saturninus</HI> has
been mentioned by <HI>Tertullian.</HI></P>
<P>5. THE next<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">I have passed by the conjesture of those, who have supposed this whole parernthesis to be an interpolation, as not deserving to be men∣tioned.</NOTE> I shall mention is that offered by<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">A short view of the Harm. of the Evang. Prop. xi.</NOTE>
Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI> which is this; “that a description or en∣rolment
of the <HI>Jews</HI> was made just before our Savi∣our's
birth, but the tax it self was not raised till the
banishment of <HI>Archelaus</HI> when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour
of <HI>Syria:</HI>” And Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> seems to approve of this
way of solving this difficulty. For he says: “If the se∣cond
verse of the second chapter of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> be so
rendered as to imply that the levying the tax, accord∣ing
to the description mentioned in the former verse,
was first executed, while <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of
<HI>Syria,</HI> this will remove all difficulties. And the text
can well bear this interpretation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Connex. Par. ii. l. ix. Anno ante ch. 5.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IN order to support this interpretation, Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>
says<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra.</NOTE> “The word used for the description at our Sa∣viour's birth is the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and that used for
<PB N="395" REF="413"/>
the taxation under <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> is the noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> He
<HI>adds,</HI> that by custom a noun of the same original with
a verb does vary in signification from it. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is to measure the earth: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is Geometry; or
the science that consists of the knowledge of numbers
and figures.—Nay in <HI>English,</HI> in the words directly
apposite to this matter, the verb to <HI>tax</HI> is oftentimes
to lay an imputation, while the noun a <HI>Tax</HI> is the levy
of money only.”</P>
<P>BUT (I.) Mr. <HI>W—n's</HI> Argument from the use of
nouns and verbs is not valid here. He says; “by cu∣stom
a noun of the same original with a verb does va∣ry
in signification from it.” This may be, and there
may be many instances of it. But it had been much
more material to give an example or two of the use of
the noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for a <HI>Tax,</HI> namely in the sense in which
he here understands it. This he has not done, and I
presume no such example can be alleged from any <HI>Greek</HI>
author.</P>
<P>I KNOW of but two or at the most three senses in
which this noun is used, which can have any relation to
this matter.</P>
<P>[1.] IT is used for the act of the people in presenting
themselves to be enrolled. As when soldiers offered
themselves to be inlisted<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See above, P. 347. n. l.</NOTE> or enrolled under a Gene∣ral,
And in a census it may be used for the act of the
people who come and offer themselves to be enrolled and
assessed. So the word seems to be used by <HI>Josephus,</HI> when
he says in the place above quoted, that <HI>Judas</HI> perswaded
not a few<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> B. J. l. vii. P. 1343. 40.</NOTE> of the <HI>Jews</HI> not to make enrolments or
entries; that is, not to offer themselves to be entered
and assessed.</P>
<P>[2.] THE word is used for a census. So it is used
by <HI>Dio</HI> in many places: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the same
as <HI>censum agere;</HI> that is, to make enrolments, is the
same as to make a census<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 557. B. vid. etiam jam citat. Pag. 496. C. 508. B. C.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="414"/>
[3.] THIS noun is used for the public Rolls or Court
Books, in which the entries were made: This sense of
the word is very common. Thus <HI>Caligula</HI> being at play
at dice, and having lost all his money, he asked for the
<HI>Gallic</HI> court rolls<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Dio.</HI> L. 59. P. 657. B.</NOTE> and ordered several of the most
wealthy of that people to be put to death, and seised
their cash. And the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose debts
were more than they could discharge, having entred the
sums they owed in Books opened for that purpose, <HI>Ser∣vius Tullius</HI> took the Books or Rolls, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]
brought them into the <HI>Forum,</HI> and paid the cre∣ditors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hal. l. iv. c. 10. P. 207. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS I have reckoned up all the senses I know of
this noun, relating to this matter. However it never
signifies a <HI>tax.</HI> Taxes were paid according to the cen∣sus,
where any had been made: but they were no part
of it. They might be remitted, or demanded. And
the tribute is never expressed by the noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
but is ever distinguished from what that signifies.</P>
<P>(2.) THIS interpretation of these words is contrary
to matter of fact. There was no tax levied after the
banishment of <HI>Archelaus</HI> according to the enrolment
made at the birth of our Saviour. But as soon as <HI>Anche∣laus</HI>
was banished, “<HI>Cyrenius</HI> came into <HI>Judea</HI> to make
an assessement of their goods.” <HI>Josephus</HI> is as express in
this matter as can be<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. l. xviiii. c. I.</NOTE>. “Then it was that <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee</HI> and his followers exclaimed, that an assessement
would bring in among them downright slavery<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS interpretation therefore is so far from being of
any service to us, that it would introduce a new, and I
think, insuperable difficulty, by putting upon these
words a sense directly contrary to what <HI>Josephus</HI> has said.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="415"/>
<HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> is so express, that there seems no
need of reasoning upon the matter, to confute this sup∣position. But I can never conceive, how a tax could
be levyed in <HI>Judea,</HI> after the removal of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> up∣on
the census or enrolment made at our Saviour's birth,
without the utmost confusion, or the utmost injustice.
When the enrolment which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of was
made, <HI>Galilee, Trachonitis,</HI> and other countries were sub∣ject
to <HI>Herod,</HI> beside <HI>Judea;</HI> many who lived in <HI>Galilee</HI>
enrolled themselves in <HI>Judea,</HI> particularly <HI>Joseph,</HI> as
St. <HI>Luke</HI> allures us. But when <HI>Archelaus</HI> was banished,
one half of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Dominions was in the possession of
<HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch and <HI>Philip,</HI> and had been so ever
since the death of <HI>Herod</HI> called the Great. And only
<HI>Judea, Samaria</HI> and <HI>Idumea,</HI> which had been subject to
<HI>Archelaus,</HI> were thrown into the form of a Roman pro∣vince. The <HI>Jews</HI> having enrolled themselves according
to their families at the time of our Saviour's nativity,
and many having come into <HI>Judea</HI> properly so called
from <HI>Galilee</HI> and other parts of <HI>Herod</HI>'s territories, a
new enrolment was absolutely necessary in <HI>Judea</HI> at the
time of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal, if they were to pay tri∣bute there in the way of a census. <HI>Judea</HI> otherwise
must have been very much over burdened. If there
was an assessement of goods made at the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, undoubtedly <HI>Joseph</HI>'s stock at <HI>Nazareth</HI>
was entered and rated at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> And as the <HI>Jews</HI>
in that part of the world were chiefly of the tribes of
<HI>Judab</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> the inhabitants of <HI>Galilee,</HI> and
<HI>Trachonitis,</HI> &amp;c. must have very generally enrolled
themselves in towns that belonged to the provine of <HI>Ju∣dea.</HI>
But it would have been very unreasonable in the
<HI>Romans,</HI> to demand tribute of the people of <HI>Judea,</HI>
properly so called, for estates and goods, which were
in the territories of the Tetrarchs <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>AND we are assured, that the <HI>Romans</HI> did use to act
equitably, and with great exactnesse in these matters.
Many of the Roman Citizens had been for a long time
oppressed with the weight of their debts. A way hav∣ing
<PB N="398" REF="416"/>
been found out A. U. 402, to give them ease, <HI>Li∣vie</HI>
says, that the next year a census was ordered, be∣cause
the property of many things had been alter∣ed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Quia solutio aeris alieni multarum rerum mutaverat dominos; censum agi placuit. lib. vii. cap. 22. n. 6. vid. &amp;. c. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>6. THE solution I shall consider in the next place,
is that, which was first offered by <HI>Herwaest</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ut hoc loco genitivus <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> vocabulo <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> additus, vim comparationis efficiat, &amp; perinde sit, ac si diceretur descriptionem illam esse <HI>Priorem</HI> priusque factam, quàm Quirinius Syriae praeficere∣tur, prefecturamque ipsius gereret. <HI>Herwaert</HI> nova &amp; vera Chrono∣logia <HI>Monachii</HI> 1612. p. 189.</NOTE> I

it is espoused. <HI>And this taxing was first made</HI> (before

rather, <HI>This taxing was made before Cyrenius was gover∣nour

interpretation, as perfectly agreeable to the genius of

rejected it, and was supposed by most to have confuted
<HI>Hertwaert</HI>'s arguments for it. <HI>Perizonius</HI> in his disser∣tation
upon this subject of the Taxing has afresh sup∣ported

he concludes, that the genitive is governed by

<P>THIS is the substance of the argument in favour of
this meaning of this passage of St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been thought by some to be an objection
against this solution, that then St. <HI>Luke</HI> has omitted to
name the person by whom this enrolment was made.
But methinks this is a defect which may be dispensed
with, if that be the only difficulty. For my own part,
I dare not absolutely reject it: but yet I am not fully
satisfied, that this is the sense of the words. I think my
self obliged to review the arguments here offered by
these learned men, and hope it may be done without
offense.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Whithy</HI>'s instances of the use <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
from the <HI>Seventy</HI> are not to the point, because the word
in St. <HI>Luke</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. There is no doubt, but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the comparative, is very often followed by a genitive
case, and denotes such or such a thing to be <HI>before</HI> an∣other.
We want some plain examples of this use of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Nor is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to the point, be∣cause
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is wanting in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and the construction
is different. The example from <HI>Isa</HI> lxv. 16. only
proves that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies the <HI>former:</HI> and tho' <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
in St. <HI>Luke</HI> should be so rendered, the difficulty will re∣main
<PB N="402" REF="420"/>
in its full force. For then the sense will be: <HI>This
former taxing was made, when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour
of</HI> Syria, Nor can the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in I <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 30. or
1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 19. do us any service, for want of a regimen
equivalent to what we have in our text. Nor do I see
what use can be made of the phrase borrowed from <HI>Ari∣stophanes.</HI>
The passage from 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xix. 43. as it is
quoted by <HI>Keuchenius</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Silentio tandem praeterire nequeo 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> cap. 19. 43. le∣gitur.

to support this interpretation, than as it is quoted by the
Doctor. Though, I suppose, the Doctor had his rea∣sons
for quoting it in that way. Nor has <HI>Perizonius</HI> quo∣ted
this text, though he had <HI>Keuchenius</HI> before him. It
is observable, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is wanting in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Grabe</HI>'s edi∣tion
of the <HI>Sepluagint,</HI> as there is nothing answerable to
it in the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> His instances from St. <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel
will be distinctly considered presently.</P>
<P>THE first quotation in <HI>Perizonius</HI> [§. 22.] which I
shall consider is <HI>John</HI> xx. 3, 4. <HI>Peter therefore went forth,
and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they
ran both together, and the other disciple did out run</HI> Peter
[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] <HI>and came first to the sepul∣chre.</HI>
Which <HI>Perizonius would render thus:</HI> and came
first, <HI>viz. before</HI> Peter; and says that the meaning can∣not
be <HI>first of all</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] because <HI>Mary
Magdalene</HI> had been there before. No for certain, it is
not, <HI>came first of all,</HI> because two only are here spoken
of; and <HI>omnium primus</HI> is not properly said of two. But
I wonder <HI>Perizonius</HI> did not perceive the proper ellipsis
in this place, and which is very obvious, namely, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
and came the <HI>first of the two. Perizonius</HI> does not
<PB N="403" REF="421"/>
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used, where two only are spoken
of;nay, he contends for it. But because it is often de∣nied<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ammon. de Sim. &amp; Diss.</NOTE> and because his proofs appear to me not very
clear, or at lest not so fully to suit my interpretation of
this text, I shall give two undoubted examples. Thus<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Dionys. Hal. Antiq. p. 234. v. 13. confer. p. 250. v. 42. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; p. 253. 10. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>
<HI>Dinysius</HI> says, that <HI>Servius Tullius</HI>'s wife was <HI>daughter of</HI>
Tarquin <HI>the first;</HI> though there were but two <HI>Tarquins</HI>
Kings of <HI>Rome. Plutarch</HI> thus describes a reftless uneasy
mind. “If he is a native of a province, of <HI>Galatia</HI> for
instance, or <HI>Bithynia;</HI> He thinks he is not well used,
if he has not some eminent post among his Citizens.
If he has that, he laments that he has not a right of
wearing the <HI>Patrician</HI> habit: If he has that, he grieves
that he is not a Roman Praetor: If he is Praetor, that
he is not Consul; and if Consul, that he was not de∣clared
first, but<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Plutatch. de. Anim. Tranq. p. 470. c.</NOTE> only the latter (of the two).”</P>
<P>THIS text then will not help <HI>Perizonius.</HI> All that
can be proved from it is, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used very pro∣perly
where two only are spoken of. If <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in St. <HI>Luke</HI>
be allowed to signify the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>former</HI> of <HI>two</HI> taxings,
all that will result from hence is, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> thought
there was another taxing beside this; and that this now
made by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was the former of the two. No in∣stance
of this sort will prove, that the meaning of this
passage is, This taxing was <HI>before,</HI> or <HI>prior</HI> to, that
made when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>THE examples from <HI>John</HI> i. 15, 30. xv. 18. are some
of the most proper examples in the whole number: and
if they are rightly understood, they are very much to
the purpose. But, with submission to these learned
men, I think they are taken by them in a wrong sense.
They are both much of the same kind; but I choose
<PB N="404" REF="422"/>
to consider first of all that alleged from <HI>John</HI> xv. 18. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<HI>If the world hate you, know that it haled me before it hated
you. Herwaert</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ille verò S.

<P>IF <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be supposed to be an adverb, when this is
not a parallel instance. But indeed, as I take it, it is nei∣ther
an adverb, nor an adjective, but a noun substantive;
or at lest, an adjective used substantively: and the latter
part of the verse ought to berendered: <HI>Know that it has
hated me</HI> YOUR CHIEF. The connexion of the words may
satisfy us, that this was our Saviour's meaning. His ar∣gument
is, that men had hated him who was superior to
them; nay, they had hated even his father; the disciples
therefore ought not to be surprised if they hate them
also, v. 20. <HI>Remember the words that I said unto you, the
servant is not greater than his Lord, if they have persecuted
me, they will also persecute you,</HI> v. 24. <HI>But now they have
both seen and hated me and my father.</HI> The force of the
argument is not, that the world had hated him <HI>before</HI> it
hated them: But he bids them consider that it hated
hated him who was <HI>their master,</HI> and whom they allow∣ed
to be so. This is the argument made use of in other
places with the same view. <HI>The disciple is not above his
master, nor the servant above his Lord.—If they have
called the master of the house</HI> Beelzebub, <HI>how much more
shall they call them of his houshold?</HI> Matth. x. 24, 25.</P>
<P>IF it be said, that there was no occasion to subjoin
<HI>your chief</HI> after <HI>me;</HI> and that the disciples could consider
Jesus no otherwise than as their master: I answer, that
it is apparent from the texts already alleged here by me,
that this was not our Saviour's stile; and that he did not
trust so much to his disciples understandings. When he
had occasion to draw any inferences from his superiori∣ty,
he always expresseth it. <HI>Ye call me Master, and Lord,
and ye say well: for so I am. If I then your Lord and
Master have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one
anothers feet,</HI> John xiii. 14.</P>

<P>THUS then <HI>John</HI> says, toward the conclusion of his

at first: <HI>I am the voice of one crying in the wildernesse,</HI>
MAKE STRAIT THE WAY OE THE LORD, Ch. i. l8.
That is, I came not on my own account, but barely as
a harbinger that makes way for his Lord. This is the
peculiar character of <HI>John,</HI> under which he was prophe∣sied
of, <HI>Isa.</HI> xl. 3. Mai. iii. I. iv. 5. And under which
he always speaks of himself. And what in the 15th and
30th verses of this Ist chapter of <HI>John,</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<HI>He is my Prince,</HI> is in the 27th verse represented by an
expression that denotes the vast superiority of Christ

<P>I AM indeed aware, that some Grammarians will ex∣cept

will then for the present suppose it to be an adjective.
But yet I cannot part with the interpretation I have gi∣ven
of either of these texts. The context satisfies me,
the sense I affix to the words is the true meaning: and I
can, if I mistake not, account for it according to the
strictest rules of the Grammarians. Let then <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in
<HI>John</HI> xv. 18. be inclusive, and be understood partitively,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will be governed by the ellipsis <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This I
suppose will not be contested. But I choose to under∣stand
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> here exclusively. I think, that is the best
sense. And then the ellipsis may be<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Perizonius</HI> says §. 24.

or whatever else the Grammarians like best. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in
<HI>John</HI> i. 15. 30. is evidently exclusive, according to my
way of rendring it; and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> following is governed
by an ellipsis of one of the last mentioned prepositions.
This I take to be perfectly agreeable to the rules of tin
Grammarians. And thus, in one place Jesus tells his
disciples, that he was chief <HI>above</HI> them; and in the
other <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> says, that Jesus was Prince or
chief <HI>above</HI> him. And now I have <HI>Beza</HI> on my side,
with reference to <HI>John</HI> i. 15. For though he would not

that this text does not express directly and simply priori∣ty
of time, but only virtually and consequentially, as
it is implied and comprehended in the superior dignity,
of which it is a part.</P>
<P>THERE is another <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the <HI>New Testament,</HI>
which has been understood by some in the same sense,
in which these learned men have taken the two former
instances, though it is not alleged by them. <HI>Now the
first day of the feast of unleavened bread,</HI> Mat. xxvi. 17.
Mark xvi. 12. This was the fourteenth day of the
month: but it is argued here, that the 15th day was
the first day of the feast of unleavened bread; for <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
says, that the 16th day of the month was<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 3. c. 10. p. 124. v. 20.</NOTE> the
second day of the feast. And the words of the Law
agree herewith. <HI>And in the fourteenth day of the first
month is the passover of the Lord. And in the fifteenth day
of this month is the feast. Seven days shall unleavened
bread be eaten,</HI> Numb, xxviii. 16, 17. Sec <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 18.
The fourteenth day therefore was the day of the Passo∣ver.
The feast of unleavened bread was distinct from
it, and lasted seven days from the 14th at night. The
fifteenth day of the month was the first of unleavened
bread. Therefore when the Evangelists, speaking of
the 14th day, say, it was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, they mean
not the <HI>first</HI> day of unleavened bread, but the day <HI>be∣fore</HI>
that Feast.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> have a rule, that in the computation of
Feasts, the day<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Quum autem Matt. 26. 17. &amp; Marc. 14. 12. ipse dies 14. Nisan appellatur primu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dies azymorum, intelligendum id est secundum canonem Judaeorum, mox traditum, scilicet in facris comedendis diem praeccdere noctem; sic ut tempus vespertinum diei 14. &amp; nox subsequens hoc medo dici 14 accenseantur. Reland. Antiq. Heb. P. 422.</NOTE> precedes the night. What stresse
ought to be laid upon this rule in this case, I know not.
I am satisfied we do not need it. The <HI>Passover</HI> was
strictly speaking distinct from the feast of <HI>unleavened
bread,</HI> and seven days of unleavened bread followed the
<PB N="410" REF="428"/>
day of the passover. But their houses were cleansed
from all leaven on the morning of the day on which the
paschal Lamb was slain, and therefore after noon they
could cat no leavened bread. For this reason, perhaps,
the day of the passover was called the first of unleavened
bread. But whatever was the reason of it, it is certain,
that the passover and the feast of unleavened bread are
often taken promiscuously the one for the other. And
tho' <HI>Josephus,</HI> in the particular account of the institution,
distinguishes the passover from the feast of unleavened
bread, yet he often calls the one the other. “At<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 17. c. 9. §. 3. p. 773. v. 25. vid. &amp; p. 609. v. 51. 887. v. 10.</NOTE> that
time, <HI>says he,</HI> the feast approaching, in which the <HI>Jews</HI>
are wont to eat unleavened bread. The feast is called
the passover, it being kept in remembrance of their
departure out of <HI>Egypt.</HI>” And in one place he says,
“we keep the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 2. c. 15. p. 88. init.</NOTE> feast of unleavened bread eight days.”
According to this method of computation, the 14th day
was the first of unleavened bread. So that when the Pas∣sover
and feast of unleavened bread were considered as
one, (as they were very often) and the whole was called
by the feast of unleavened bread, the fourteenth day must
be the first. The Evangelists perhaps do not write in sys∣tem:
nor does <HI>Josephus,</HI> as it seems, nor indeed any other
good writers; but according to the usual way of speaking.</P>

affirming, says, <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> that <HI>Alexamenus</HI> wrote
dialogues before <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is very plain to me, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> says that
<HI>Alexamenus</HI>'s dialogues were the first Socratic dialogues;
that is, that <HI>Alexamenus</HI> was the inventer of that way of
writing. I have transcribed the passage of <HI>Athenaeus</HI>
more at length then <HI>Herwaert</HI> has done. And if the
reader will consider the whole of it, I think he will be
convinced: 1st, That by <HI>Socratic dialogues</HI> is here meant,
not <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>dialogues</HI> in which he introduces <HI>Socrates,</HI> but
in general that way of writing: and 2dly, That <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
says that <HI>Alexamenus</HI>'s dialogues were<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">So <HI>Athanaeus</HI> says expresly: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> the first
of the Kind. From whence <HI>Athenaeus</HI> infers very justly,
that <HI>Aristotle</HI> says expresly, that <HI>Alexamenus</HI> wrote dia∣logues
before <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>I THINK likewise, that <HI>Athenaeus</HI> never dreamt of
that meaning of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s words, which <HI>Herwaert</HI> af∣fixes
to them. Interpret <HI>Aristotle</HI> as <HI>Herwaert</HI> does,
and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> is guilty of a ridiculous tautology in his inference.</P>
<P>THAT I understand <HI>Aristotle</HI> aright, is farther evi∣dent
from <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> whose words upon the
same subject are thus: “Some say that <HI>Zeno</HI> the <HI>Elean</HI>
was the first writer of Dialogues, but <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his
first book of Poets says that <HI>Alexamenus</HI> the <HI>Teian</HI>
was,” as does also <HI>Phavorinus</HI> in his commentaries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Diog. Laert. l. iii. Segm. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="430"/>
BUT tho' I contest all these instances (as thinking I
have given the true meaning of all those places) it must
be allowed, that <HI>Perizonius</HI>'s example from <HI>Aristopha∣nes,</HI>
and another from <HI>Alexander Aphrodisius</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ictus prius tonitru perficit quàm sulgur, aut simul. Alexand. Aphrod. Problem. l. i.</NOTE> al∣leged
by others in this cause, prove that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, used
adverbially, is put without <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> following it to denote
the priority they contend for. How far the argu∣ment
will hold by way of analogy from adverbs to
adjectives, I cannot say. It ought also to be allowed,
that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xix. 43. (but
not found in all copies of the <HI>Seventy</HI>) is an equiva∣lent
phrase to that in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and to be understood
in the same sense put upon St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words. The pas∣sage
from the <HI>Maccabees, Last of all after the sons the
mother died,</HI> contains also a parallel phrase. To these
I add two other instances<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ante eas res quae vere sunt, &amp; ante pricipia universalium est unus deus prior etiam pri∣mo deo &amp; rege.

I am unwilling to contest, and shall leave with the
reader.</P>
<P><HI>PERIZONIUS</HI>'s way of accounting for this con∣struction
by the ellipsis of a preposition to be understood,
when not expressed, is well argued from the two in∣stances
he has alleged of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> subjoined to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. I add
another like instance from <HI>Eusebius</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Praepar. Ev. l. 14. c. 2.</NOTE> Though per∣haps

<P>I PRESUME this may be sufficient to shew, that the
phrase in St. <HI>Luke</HI> is capable of the sense contended for
by these learned men. But I cannot yet perswade my
<PB N="413" REF="431"/>
self, that it is the real sense of the text for the following
reasons.</P>
<P>1. THIS is a very uncommon use of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
This, I think, is evident, in that the Critics have been so
much at a losse for instances. <HI>Stevens</HI> knew of none<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> priùs. Alexander Aphrodisius, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

Theasaur. Gr. Tom. 3. 567. A.</NOTE> be∣side
that produced above from <HI>Aphrodisius,</HI> where <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is used adverbially. There are also almost innumerable
other ways of expressing this priority of time<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> [adverb.] <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp;c.</NOTE> The rea∣son
of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers so rarely using this word thus is ve∣ryobvious:
It can hardly be done without causing some
ambiguity; therefore when they use it in this sense, we
see they often subjoin <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. That this use of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was
designedly avoided, seems to me evident from a passage
of <HI>Herodotus;</HI> where having in the former branch of the
sentence twice used the superlative, in the latter he takes
the comparative; either to avoid ambiguity, or as more
agreeable to the genius of the <HI>Greek</HI> language<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Herodot. 1. 2. init. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> before the reign of <HI>Psammetichus</HI> thought themselves the first [or most ancient] of all peo∣ple. But since the reign of <HI>Psammetichus,</HI> who made an experiment for finding out who were the first of all people, they have thought that the <HI>Phrygians</HI> were before them, they before others.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. It does not appear that any of the first <HI>Christians</HI>
understood St. <HI>Luke</HI> in this sense. That they did not so
interpret this text, we are assured from the <HI>Syriac, Vul∣gate,</HI>
and other Versions; from <HI>Justin Martyr, Eusebius,</HI>
and from the passage of <HI>Julian</HI> above quoted; in which
he certainly represents the common opinion of people
in his time, of <HI>Christians</HI> and others.</P>
<P>7. THERE is another solution, which was first pro∣posed
by<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bez. in loc. Vid. &amp; Huet. Dem. Ev. Prop. ix. cap. x. §. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Beza,</HI> and has been embraced by many

Dissert. ii. p. 320.—322. Pagi. app. ad ann. Bar. Num. 126—129.</NOTE> men. The Roman Catholic authors, that
approve of this solution, agree to understand the words,
as they stand in the vulgate version: <HI>This first Description
or Enrolment was made by</HI> Cyrenius<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Haec descriptio prima facta est a praeside Syriae, Cyrino.</NOTE> The Protestants
generally render them: <HI>This first Enrolment was made,</HI>
Cyrenius <HI>being President of</HI> Syria: <HI>or, when</HI> Cyrenius
<HI>was President of</HI> Syria<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Haec descriptio prima facta est prae∣sidente Syriae Cyrenio. Bez. Haec descriptio prima facta est cum praeesset Syriae Cyrenius. Casaub. ubi supra. Num. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By President of <HI>Syria</HI> they do not understand Presi∣dent
in the most strict and proper sense of the word; it
being apparent from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that either <HI>Saturninus,</HI> or
<HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> must have been President of <HI>Syria</HI> at the
time this enrolment was made. And there is no instance
of two persons being jointly Presidents with equal power
in the same province, when a province was in peace, as
<HI>Syria</HI> was at this time<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid. Noris. Cenotaph. Pis. Diss. ii. cap. 16. §. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY suppose, that when <HI>Augustus</HI> had issued his
decree that all the world, that is, all the <HI>Roman Em∣pire</HI>
should be taxed, (for in this wide and extensive
sense do these learned men understand these words of
St. <HI>Luke) Cyrenius</HI> was sent with extraordinary power
to make the census in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea:</HI> And <HI>Saturninus</HI>
or <HI>Quintilius Varus,</HI> which soever of them was then Presi∣dent,
was joined with him: and was subordinate to him,
or had equal power with him in this particular work.
<HI>Cyrenius</HI> therefore having at this time some power in <HI>Sy∣ria,</HI>
he is called President of it, though he was not pro∣perly
President or the ordinary chief magistrate of that
province.</P>
<P>IN order to justify this solution two things are to be
considered: 1. Whether <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> though not proper∣ly
President of <HI>Syria,</HI> may be called so in a loose and
general sense: 2. It must be shewn, that it is not unlike∣ly,
<PB N="415" REF="433"/>
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> might be sent upon this affair at this
time with extraordinary power.</P>
<P>As to the first point, it is alleged, that the title of
<HI>Governour</HI> or <HI>President</HI> is often given to others beside
those who are properly possessed of that dignity. <HI>Josephus</HI>
calls <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius</HI> Presidents of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. 1. 16. c. 9. p. 734. v. 25, &amp; 37. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ib. c. 10. p. 741. v. 1.</NOTE>,
though <HI>Saturninus</HI> was at that time President, according
to his own account, and <HI>Volumnius</HI> Procurator only, <HI>i. e.</HI>
the officer that took care of the Emperour's revenue in
that province.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Cyrenius</HI> might be sent upon this affair with
extraordinary power, is not at all unlikely. For the
office of Censor in the City was very honourable, and
was a distinct charge from that of the Consuls and Prae∣tors,
the ordinary magistrates. The surveys in pro∣vinces
also were often performed not by the ordinary go∣vernours
but by persons sent thither with extraordinary
power, and those, persons of the highest eminence and
dignity<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Regimen summae rei penes Germanicum agendo Galliarum censui turn intentum. Tacit. Ann. 1. i. c. 31. ad A. U. 767. Interea Germanico per Gallias, ut diximus, <HI>census accipienti, excessisse Augustum,</HI> adfertur. Id. c. 33. vid. &amp; 1. ii. c. 6.</NOTE>.</P>

THIS quick dispatch he made of affairs of impor∣tance

this Census in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER there is nothing in the history which we

in this work.</P>
<P>CYRENIUS was Consul of <HI>Rome,</HI> A. U. 742. He
might therefore very well be sent upon the expedition
against the <HI>Homonadenses</HI> in the year U. C. 747. or, pos∣sibly,
in 746. It was a piece of prudent advice which

the provinces<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Id. 1. 53. p. 505. C. Auctor &amp; aliarum rerum fuit. In quies—ne magistratus deposito statim honore in provincias mitterentur. Sueton. Aug. c. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s expedition against the forementioned
people was his first action after his consulship, he might
very probably be employed in it, A. U. 747. Archbi∣shop
<HI>Usher</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Ann. A. 5. ante aer. Chr.</NOTE> thinks he was then Proconsul of <HI>Cilicia.</HI>
Cardinal <HI>Noris</HI> thinks it more likely that he was not
then the ordinary Governour of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> but that he was
sent upon this expedition with extraordinary<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cenotaph. Pis. Diss. ii. p. 319</NOTE> power,
<PB N="417" REF="435"/>
However the learned men that embrace this solution sup∣pose,
that having finished this war, he might be sent in∣to
<HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea</HI> to perform the Census there, in the
latter end of the year of <HI>Rome,</HI> 747; or, as others, in
748, or 749. About which time the census or enrol∣ment,
which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks of, must have been made;
for <HI>Herod</HI> died in the year 750, or 751.</P>
<P>CYRENIUS was not appointed Governour to <HI>Caius
Cesar</HI> till the year U. C. 755. Cardinal <HI>Noris</HI> infers this
from the words of <HI>Tacitus</HI> above-cited: <HI>datus Rector
Caio Caesari Armeniam obtinenti.</HI> It is evidently a mis∣take
of thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> learned men who have thought that <HI>Cyre∣nius</HI>
was Governour to <HI>Caius,</HI> when he first went into
the <HI>East.</HI> It is certain, that <HI>M. Lollius</HI> was then his
Governour. And <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not put into that post
till after the death of <HI>Lollius</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Velleius. 1. ii. c. 102. Suet. Tib. c. 13. Noris. ubi supra, p. 317<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>, which seems to have
happened some time in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 755. Besides,
it is certain from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Caius</HI> was at <HI>Rome</HI> after
the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> and therefore was not yet set out
for the <HI>East.</HI> For he was one of those whom <HI>Augustus</HI>
called to the Council he held after <HI>Herod</HI>'s death about
confirming his last will<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. 1. 17. c. 9. p. 775. v. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CYRENIUS therefore seems to have been at lei∣sure
for this work: And from the whole of his story
and character, so far as it is come down to us from the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, no man appears more likely
to have been employed in it.</P>
<P>THIS solution has one advantage above most of
those above-mentioned, in that it is here allowed, that
this survey was performed by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> in which all the
ancient christian writers agree, except <HI>Tertullian;</HI> who
in one place (but the only place in which he has named
the chief officer concerned in it) ascribes it to <HI>Saturni∣nus.</HI>
And we are much obliged to these learned men
for tracing the history of <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> and thereby remo∣ving,
in part at lest, the objections against this suppo∣sition,
which has been the current opinion of Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="436"/>
THERE is however one difficulty attending this solu∣tion:
I mean the sense, in which these learned men un∣derstand
<HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s government or presidentship. I do not
at all contest the validity of their argument, that the
title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may be given to one who is not properly
President. But since <HI>Cyrenius</HI> certainly was afterwards
the ordinary governour of <HI>Syria,</HI> it is not easy to under∣stand
this title in St. <HI>Luke</HI> in a loose and general way.
And I can never perswade my self, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> intend∣ed
no more than the power and authority of making a
census in <HI>Syria.</HI> If <HI>Cyrenius</HI> had never been President of
<HI>Syria,</HI> perhaps their instances had been to the point; but
now, I think, they are not. Besides, according to the
way in which these learned men generally interpret St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. is here the genitive case abso∣lute,
or governed by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> understood: either of which
does as fully express <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s being President of <HI>Syria,</HI>
as any form of expression can do.</P>
<P>JOSEPH SCALIGER seems to have interpre∣ted
these words somewhat differently from other learn∣ed
men who embrace this solution. He takes them thus.
<HI>This description was the first under</HI> Cyrenius <HI>president of</HI>
Syria. I put his words in the margin<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ideo S. Lucas non contentus est dicere <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Sed quum duas <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> sci∣ret fuisse, addidit, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Certè si est—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ergo quaedm fuit <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; &amp; sane <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> me∣minit idem. Act. v. 37. Antque ita distinguendum esse nemo dubitare potest. scaliger. animadv. in Chron. Euseb. ad. A. 2016.</NOTE>, that the rea∣der
may judge whether I misunderstand him. But still
this interpretation is liable to the objection last men∣tioned:
for it is implied in it, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Presi∣dent
of <HI>Syria,</HI> at the time of both these Surveys.</P>
<P>§. V. THERE is yet another interpretation, which
these words are capable of, and which has for some time
appeared to me the genuine meaning of them. <HI>This wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the first ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssement of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>Governour of</HI> Syria. The
natural order of the words is this: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
There are innumerable instances
<PB N="419" REF="437"/>
of a construction parallel with this here of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Matth. xxii. 38. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

Deut. vi. 1. &amp; alibi,</NOTE> the margin. It is easie for the reader to observe,
these instances are parallel with the words before us:
the particle <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> follows <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and pre∣ceeds
the Substantive.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is not here <HI>facta est, was made,</HI> but <HI>fuit, was.</HI>
I presume I need not give any proofs, that this is a very
common meaning of this verb.</P>
<P>THE distant situation of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in St. <HI>Luke</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
need not create any scruple. In some examples the verb
substantive is quite wanting, as in <HI>Mark</HI> xii. 30. <HI>Numb.</HI>
i. 44. Sometimes <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is expressed, and follows imme∣diately
after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But it is found in all kinds of positi∣ons
in passages parallel with this of St. <HI>Luke.</HI> I give one
instance which answers the construction of this verse in
every respect, <HI>Rev.</HI> xix. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>These are the true sayings of God.</HI> And ano∣ther
instance from <HI>Plato</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Phaedo. Fin.</NOTE> of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> it self, in a

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
“This, O <HI>Echecrates.</HI> was the end of our

man that ever we knew.”</P>
<P>IF it be objected, that it must be <HI>this census;</HI> or this
<HI>first census</HI> was made, and not this was the first census;
because there is no noun substantive preceding <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by
which it can be governed: I answer, that as I interpret;
the words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is governed by the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that follows,
or by an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> understood. And this is the case of
<PB N="420" REF="438"/>
many other<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 48. v. I. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. v. 29. 30. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> passages, which yet must be constru∣ed,
as I do St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>LET us proceed. When St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls <HI>Cyrenius Go∣vernour
of Syria,</HI> I understand the words in the strict
and proper sense. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is not the geni∣tive
case absolute, or governed by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> understood, and
to be construed, <HI>Cyrenius being gevernour of Syria,</HI> or
<HI>when Cyrenius was governour of Syria;</HI> but it is governed
by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. They do not express any time at all. But
this is <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s title, the title, by which he was well
known in that part of the world. As we say, <HI>Antony</HI>
the <HI>Triumvir,</HI> or <HI>Cato</HI> the Censor, to distinguish them
from others of the same names. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
is with me the same thing, as if St. <HI>Luke</HI> had said,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that <HI>Greek</HI> Authors delight very much
in the use of participles; and, I think, more especially
when they speak of titles and dignities. Thus <HI>Cicero,</HI>
in<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Lib. 43. P. 250. D.</NOTE> <HI>Dio,</HI> says: “We expect that our Praetors and
Consuls should follow the laws of reason and ju∣stice.”
The same historian<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Lib. 45. P. 274. C.</NOTE> says: “The three
brothers, the <HI>Antonies,</HI> had all of them some office in
the City at one and the same time: <HI>Marcus</HI> was Con∣sul,
<HI>Lucius</HI> Tribune, and <HI>Caius</HI> Praetor.”</P>
<P>THESE participles seem to me to be sometimes sub∣stantives,
or at lest, to be<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. 1. 62. p. 791. A. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. p. 907. v. 12. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. p. 945. v. 35.</NOTE> used substantively. I be∣lieve
all are sensible that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is so used. Some of those
other titles of offices or dignities expressed by partici∣ples
seem to me to be very near, or altogether parallel
with it.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="439"/>
BUT let <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be a mere participle; only
then it will be said: If it be governed by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> it
ought to have been <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. To this I answer,
that undoubtedly <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> would have been very
proper, but so is also <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is no uncommon
thing for <HI>Greek</HI> authors to use the, Present tense for the
first Aorist. I give an instance or two that may fully
justify my interpretation. <HI>Josephus</HI> says: And it is cer∣tain
“that <HI>Varus</HI> was of a Royal Family, since he was
a descendant of <HI>Soemus</HI> who was Tetrarch of a coun∣try
near mount<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pag. 909. v. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Libanus.” <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dionysius</HI> says, that the <HI>Latins</HI> were so called
from <HI>Latinus</HI> a King of that country<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. R. lib. 2. p. 76. v. 24.</NOTE>. If any
should say, it is improper to understand this parti∣ciple,
as I do, because <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not Governour of
<HI>Syria</HI> till after the time in which St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s survey was
made, I add one example more, which must fully ob∣viate
this exception. <HI>Herodian</HI> says, “That to <HI>Marcus</HI>
the Emperour were born several daughters<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. init.</NOTE> and
two sons.” <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Yet several of those children were
born to him before he was Emperour. This instance
shews plainly, that these participles do not always im∣port
only the time when men are in office.</P>
<P>I HOPE this is sufficient to shew, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is the same as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> at lest that it is governed by
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The supposing <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to be the
Genitive absolute, or governed by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as it has given
occasion for the objection we are now upon, so it seems
to have carried most learned men off from the right
way of solving it.</P>
<P>I APPREHEND I have now justified my interpreta∣tion
of every part of this verse: <HI>This was the first As∣sessement</HI>
(or survey) <HI>of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>the Governour of</HI> Syria,
or <HI>of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>who was Governour of</HI> Syria.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="440"/>
BUT if any choose rather to take <HI>Scaliger</HI>'s method,
as to the first part of the verse, I shall not contend
about that, provided my sense of the later part be ad∣mitted.
Then the interpretation will stand thus: This
survey was the first [<HI>survey</HI>] of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> the Governour
of <HI>Syia.</HI></P>
<P>NOR can I see any reason why all those who follow
<HI>Beza,</HI> and suppose that this survey was made by <HI>Cyre∣nius,</HI>
as well as that made after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal,
should not receive this interpretation. When they come
to shew, why this is called by St. <HI>Luke</HI> the first survey,
though indeed they have not translated the place as I
do,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Denique dicitur haec descriptio <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, ut distinguatur ab aliâ, de qua <HI>Act.</HI> v. 57. quam Josephus &amp; Eusebius litteris consignarunt, &amp; sub Cyrenio etiam factam dicunt, licet diverso tempore. Hamm. in

the same manner, only he salsely supposed that <HI>Cyrenius</HI>

<P>SOME time after I had been perswaded this was the
sense of this text, I met with these words of <HI>Tanaquil
Faber</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Epist. lib. i. ep. 43.</NOTE>. <HI>Beatus Lucas,</HI> cap. 2. <HI>ait natum esse Chrir∣stum

a Cyenio seu Quirinio facta est.</HI> This passage gave me a
great deal of pleasure, though it does not appear how
this acute and learned man understood <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—
But I have since met with a more explicite authority for
my way of translating <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The title of <HI>Ori∣gen</HI>'s
xith Homily upon St. <HI>Luke,</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> edition of
his works, is thus: <HI>De eo quod scriptum est, Puer autem
<PB N="423" REF="441"/>
crescebat &amp; confortabatur spiritu, usque ad eum locum ubi
ait: Haec est descriptio prima quae facta est sub praeside
Syiae Cyrino.</HI> And in the body of the<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Haec fuit descriptio prima, a praeside Syriae Cyrino.</NOTE> Homily are
words to the same effect.</P>
<P>THE version I here offer does not only appear to me
a very natural and obvious meaning of the words, but
it is very good sense, and extremely suitable to their po∣sition
in a parenthesis. <HI>In those days there went out a decree
from</HI> Cesar Augustus <HI>that all the world</HI> [Land] <HI>should be
taxed.</HI> (<HI>This was the first assessement of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>the Gover∣nour
of</HI> Syria.) It is needless to observe, that if this ver∣sion
be allowed, the objection we are considering va∣nishes.
There is no colour or pretense to say, that St.
<HI>Luke</HI> confounded the census or survey, made in the
time of <HI>Herod,</HI> with that made after the removal of
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P>§. VI. I APPREHEND there lies now no objection
against St. <HI>Luke,</HI> but what may arise from the doubts
which some may have in their minds, concerning <HI>Cyre∣nius</HI>
being the officer employed in making this survey.
I wish the reader be not quite tired with this long succes∣sion
of criticisms. But whether he will accompany me
any farther or not, I think my self obliged to take into
consideration all the difficulties which attend this parti∣cular
circumstance.</P>
<P>HERE I adopt at once all that has been already of∣fered
by those who embrace <HI>Beza</HI>'s solution, to make
it appear probable, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> performed the census
of which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks. But now I enjoy a peculiar
advantage above those learned men, in the supposition
I advanced at first, that this census of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was of
<HI>Judea</HI> only. They think, that <HI>Augustus</HI>'s decree ex∣tended
to the whole Empire; and that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was sent
with extraordinary power to make the census in <HI>Syria</HI>
and <HI>Judea.</HI> But they suppose, (and indeed they are
obliged to allow it) that <HI>Saturninus</HI> was joyned with
him, if <HI>Saturninus</HI> was then president. This has given
<PB N="224" REF="442"/>
<HI>Perizonius</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Dissert. de Aug. Descrip. §. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> a fine advantage against their supposition,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was concerned in this census. To give <HI>Cy∣renius</HI>
superior or equal power to <HI>Saturninus</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI>
the province of which he was the ordinary governour,
would have been an affront; especially considering that
<HI>Saturninus</HI> was equal to <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> in every respect, and
superior to him in some: for he was of a better family,
and the elder Consul by seven years. And it is no less
injurious to <HI>Cyrenius</HI> to put him under <HI>Saturninus.</HI></P>
<P>I AM not at all concerned with this. I think <HI>Cyre∣nius</HI>
performed the census alone, by virtue of the extra∣ordinary
power with which he was sent. But if any are
inclined to think, that <HI>Saturninus</HI> was joined in the com∣mission
with him, this would be no disparagement to
<HI>Saturninus.</HI> To give him authority in a neighbouring
kingdom where he had none before, would not be to
lessen him, but to augment his power. Nor do I sup∣pose,
it could be any disgrace to <HI>Cyrenius</HI> to have the
Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> made his partner.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to consider all the difficulties that can
affect the supposition that this census was made by <HI>Cy∣renius,</HI>
as far as I am concerned with them.</P>
<P>I. IT is said, that it was not customary for the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
to send any great man twice into the same country.
Since it is certain from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after∣wards
made a census in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> it may be con∣cluded,
he did not perform that survey, which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
says was made in <HI>Judea</HI> at the time of our Saviour's
nativity<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Multis de causis displicet nobis gemina haec Cyrenii descriptio. Bis ad eandem rem Quirinium in Syriam fuisse missum, fidem vir imperat, nec Romanos ad mores quadrat. Basnage. Ann. Pol, Ecc. ant. Dom. 5. num. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this I answer: I allow, that it was not usual for
the same person to be more than once made the Presi∣dent

<P>I WILL give an undeniable example of an officer's be∣ing
twice in the same province with different degrees of
power. When <HI>Piso</HI> prefect of <HI>Syria</HI> had been removed
by <HI>Germanicus,</HI> and after that <HI>Germanicus</HI> himself died,
the officers in the province had a consultation together,
who should be made President of <HI>Syria. Vibius Marsus</HI>
laid claim to it, but at last yielded to <HI>Cn. Sentius Satur∣ninus</HI>
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Consultatum inde inter legatos, quique alii senatorum aderant, quisnam Syriae praeficeretur. Et ceteris modice nisis, inter VIBIUM MARSUM &amp; Cn.

This alone is a proof, that it was very common for of∣ficers

be actually president of <HI>Syria.</HI> There is therefore no
absurdity at all in supposing, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was sent by
<HI>Augustus</HI> with extraordinary power at the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s reign to make a survey in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that about
ten or twelve years afterwards he came as the ordinary
governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> and then made a census in that
province and in <HI>Judea</HI> annexed to it.</P>
<P>2. IT is objected, that none of the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek.</HI>
historians, tho' <HI>Cyrenius</HI> has been spoken of by several
of them, have taken any notice of this census.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that this is no difficulty at all. I sup∣pose,
that no one will make any question, but that <HI>Cy∣renius</HI>
made an assessement in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> when he
was sent president into <HI>Syria,</HI> because we have <HI>Josephus</HI>'s
authority for it. And yet none of the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI>
authors have said any thing of that census.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Tacitus</HI> has in the passage cited above rec∣koned
up divers of <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s exploits and honours,
and others have made mention of him and some of his
services; yet <HI>Florus</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Marmaridas atque Garamantas Curinio subigendo dedit [Au∣gustus]. Potuit &amp; ille redire Marmaricus; sed modestior in aestiman∣da victoria fuit. Florus lib. iv. cap. 12.</NOTE> has taken notice of a conside∣rable
action of his, omitted by all the rest: If indeed
he means our <HI>Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>3. BUT it will be said: It maybe certainly concluded
from the account which <HI>Josephus</HI> has given of the Cen∣sus
made<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See the account above, p. 386.</NOTE> by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s banishment,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> had never been in <HI>Judea</HI> or enrolled the
<HI>Jews</HI> before. If he had, <HI>Josephus</HI> could not well have
omitted to take notice of it then.</P>
<P>I OWN, that at first sight this must appear a very con∣siderable difficulty.</P>
<P>BUT it ought to be observed, that <HI>Josephus</HI> does
not particularly name any of <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s honours or ser∣vices,
beside those which relate to the City of <HI>Rome.
<PB N="427" REF="445"/>
Josephus</HI> knew of divers others, but he does not ex∣presse
them. And among those omitted or referred to
the general only, may be that of the first survey in
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) I THINK it is plain, that either <HI>Josephus</HI> did
not care to give any particular account of that oath ta∣ken
by the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Augustus</HI> in the latter end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, or else that he found but a slight account of it
in those memoirs or histories which he made use of. He
had said nothing of it, had it not been for a most re∣markable
disturbance in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court and family, with
which it had a connexion.</P>
<P>AND any one may perceive, that it is then touched
upon very slightly. Is it not strange that <HI>Josephus</HI> should
not name the officer that took the oath for <HI>Augustus?</HI>
No one can make any doubt, but there was some per∣son
of eminence deputed by the Emperour for that
work. As <HI>Josephus</HI> did not mention him then, I should
never expect to find his name afterwards. And who∣ever
can account for <HI>Josephus</HI>'s omissions relating to the
affair of the oath, may account for his silence in this
passage, tho' <HI>Cyrenius</HI> had been once before in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) I THINK that arguments formed upon the omis∣sions
of Historians are of very little weight. There are
in <HI>Josephus</HI> other omissions as remarkable as this. I de∣sire
to consider the account he gives, in his <HI>War of the
Jews,</HI> of the reducing <HI>Judea</HI> to a province. “<HI>Arche∣laus</HI>'s
country being reduced to a province, <HI>Coponius</HI>
a man of the <HI>Equestrian</HI> rank among the <HI>Romans</HI> was
sent Procurator, being invested with the power of life
and death. In his time [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] a certain <HI>Galilean,</HI>
whose name was <HI>Judas,</HI> excited the people to a rebel∣lion,
telling them, That they were of a mean spirit,
if they could endure to pay tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and
acknowledge mortal men for their Lords after God
had been their King. This man was the head of a
distinct sect in nothing like<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">De Bell. Lib. ii. cap. 8. §. 1.</NOTE> the rest.” This is all
he says. He does not say there was now any census
<PB N="428" REF="446"/>
made, has not one word of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> or his coming into
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Josephus</HI> has in two other places in
the <HI>War of the Jews</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 17. §. 8. &amp; l. 7. c. 8. §. 1.</NOTE> occasionally mentioned <HI>Cyre∣nius,</HI>
and in the later of those places, his census also,
But it must be allowed to be a very great omission, not
to do this in the proper place, in the account of the re∣duction
of <HI>Judea</HI> to the state of a province. This might
have been reasonably expected in the history of the
War, when this assessement made by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> and the
principles broached at that time, were main founda∣tions
of it.</P>
<P>IF it be said, that <HI>Josephus</HI> passed over this affair
slightly in <HI>the War,</HI> because he intended to write his <HI>Anti∣quities</HI>
and mention it more particularly then: I answer,
this is said without ground. And I might as well say,
that <HI>Josephus</HI> omitted in his <HI>Antiquities</HI> the particular ac∣count
of <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s first assessement, because he intended
to write afterward another book of the history of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> and go over their affairs once more, as he ex∣pressly
assures us at the conclusion of his <HI>Antiquities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> informs us in his <HI>Life,</HI> writ after <HI>the
War,</HI> and <HI>the Antiquities,</HI> that the <HI>Jews</HI> had a battle
with <HI>Gessius Florus</HI> their last Procurator, and killed him
and a good many of his men; and that this victory
was fatal to them: Forasmuch as this determined them
to the war with the<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. in Vit. §. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Romans.</HI> Is it not strange that
<HI>Josephus</HI> should say nothing of this in the history of <HI>the
War,</HI> where he has made so frequent mention of <HI>Florus,</HI>
and ascribed the <HI>jewish</HI> uneasinesse under the Roman Go∣vernment
to the cruelties and other irregularities of this
man? For this instance I am indebted to<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hist. Eccl. A. D. 66. n. 12.</NOTE> Mr.
<HI>Le Clerc.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="447"/>
THERE is another omission appears to me very re∣markable.
<HI>Pheroras, Herod</HI>'s youngest brother, is of∣ten
mentioned by <HI>Josephus.</HI> He has particularly inform∣ed
us, that when <HI>Augustus</HI> was in <HI>Syria,</HI> he gave this
<HI>Pheroras</HI> a Tetrarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 15. c. 10. §. 3.</NOTE> at the request of <HI>Herod.</HI>
And we are informed by <HI>Josephus,</HI> of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s retire∣ment
into his Tetrarchy, of <HI>Herod</HI>'s visiting him there,
and of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s dying<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. l. xvii. c. 3. de B. J. l. i. c. 29.</NOTE> at home, and of his being
brought afterwards from thence to be buried. But yet,
if I mistake not, he has never once said what this Te∣trachy
was, whose it had been before, nor where it lay.
It is true, that whereas in the <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. p. 756. v. 37.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus</HI>
says, <HI>Pheroras</HI> went to his Tetrarchy; in his <HI>War</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. p. 1031. v. 41. vid. &amp; p. 103 z. v. 26.</NOTE>
he says, he went to <HI>Peraea,</HI> (or as in some copies <HI>Pe∣traea</HI>):
but <HI>Peraea,</HI> properly so called, could not be
this Tetrarchy, because <HI>Peraea</HI> belonged all along to
<HI>Herod.</HI> But this Tetrarchy of <HI>Pheroras</HI> was given him
by <HI>Augustus,</HI> and was distinct from that estate or reve∣nue
which<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 15. c. 10. §. 3.</NOTE> had been settled upon him by <HI>Herod.</HI>
These particulars may convince us, that, though <HI>Cyre∣nius</HI>
was in <HI>Judea</HI> in the time of <HI>Herod, Josephus</HI> was
capable of omitting to take notice of it.</P>
<P>4. AGAIN, it will be said: It may be fairly con∣cluded
from another place in <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI>
was but once in <HI>Judea.</HI> For he says, that “<HI>Massada</HI>
was then held by <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the chief man of the <HI>sicarii,</HI>
a descendent of <HI>Judas,</HI> who perswaded not a few of
the <HI>Jews</HI> not to enrole themselves, as I have said<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Bell. l. z. c. 17. §. 8.</NOTE>
above, when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> the Censor was<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. de B. l. 7. c. 8. §. 1.</NOTE> sent into
<HI>Judea.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="448"/>
I OWN it, this is a difficulty, but the argument is
not conclusive. It is true, that <HI>Judas</HI> made this distur∣bance
when <HI>Cyrenius was sent into</HI> Judea, or in the time
of <HI>Cyrenius:</HI> but it does not follow, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was
sent but once into <HI>Judea.</HI> The <HI>New Testament</HI> will af∣ford
us an instance upon this very subject which will be
of use to us. <HI>Camaliel</HI> says: <HI>After this man rose up</HI> Judas
<HI>of</HI> Galilee, <HI>in the days of the taxing, and drew away much
people after him,</HI> Acts v. 37. If we had in our hands
this book only of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> namely, <HI>The Acts of the Apo∣stles;</HI>
it is not unlikely that many would have supposed,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> knew of no other taxing made in <HI>Judea,</HI>
but that, in the time of which <HI>Judas</HI> rose up. But we
are assured from his <HI>Gospel,</HI> that this conclusion would
have been false: for there he has spoke very particular∣ly
of another, which he calls the <HI>first,</HI> or at lest distin∣guishes
very plainly from some other.</P>
<P>I MUST be allowed to repeat here once more, that
arguments formed upon the silence of writers are very
seldom of much moment. <HI>Josephus</HI> is the only <HI>jewish</HI>
writer of those times, in whom we have the history of
that country: And it cannot be justly concluded that
any particular thing was not done, or that such or such
a circumstance did not attend it, because he has not
mentioned it. All writers have their particular views,
and some things we are very desirous to know might for
some reason or other, which we are ignorant of, lie
without the compass of their designs. Besides, the most
accurate and careful historians have omitted many facts
or incidents, that might be very properly mentioned,
through forgetfulnesse or oversight. I take the omission
of the description of the Tetrarchy that belonged to
<HI>Pheroras</HI> to be a remarkable instance of this sort.</P>
<P>5. But it will be said, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> is positive, the
census in <HI>Judea</HI> at the time of our Saviour's birth was
made by <HI>Sentius Saturninus</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sed &amp; census constat actos sub Augusto nunc in Judaea per Sea∣tium Saturninum. Apud quos genus ejus inquirere potuissent. Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Marc, lib, iv. c. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="449"/>
I ANSWER to this: (1.) It ought to be considered,
at the Heretic <HI>Marcion,</HI> with whom <HI>Tertullian</HI> dis∣putes
in this place, did not admit the authority of the
first chapter<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Accedit his Cerdon quidam.—Solum evangelium Lucae, nec tamen totum recipit. Post hunc discipulus ipsius emersit Marcion.—Haeresin Cerdonis approbare conatus est. De praescrip. Haeret. c. 51.</NOTE> of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Gospel. And it was the
custom of <HI>Tertullian</HI> to argue from those parts of scrip∣ture,
which the Heretics he was dealing with<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quam &amp; argumentationibus earum, &amp; scripturis quibus utuntur, provocavimus ex abundanti. De carne Christi. cap. 25.</NOTE> ac∣knowkdged.
Possibly therefore <HI>Tertullian</HI> having, or
supposing he had reason to think, that this census was
made, when <HI>Saturninus</HI> was president of <HI>Syria,</HI> he
might choose to mention the ordinary officer as a thing
certain: but yet might not intend to affirm that the
census was made by him, but only that it happened in
his time. <HI>Isaac Casaubon</HI> judged it not unreasonable so
to understand <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who often uses words<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tertullianus cum adversus Marcio. scribit, <HI>Sed &amp; constat,</HI>—ad majorem sidem magistratum ordinarium potius nominat, quam ex∣traordinarium. Ait autem <HI>per Sentium Saturninum</HI> durè &amp; Tertullia∣nice, hoc est, improprie pro <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, vel <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Casaub. Exercit. 1. n. 31.</NOTE> im∣properly.
I thought it not fit to deprive the reader of
his answer of this learned man, But I do not adopt
his interpretation of <HI>Tertullian.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) <HI>TERTULLIAN</HI>'s authority ought not to
outweigh the testimony of more ancient writers, who
were nearer the event. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> in his first apo∣logy,
presented to the <HI>Roman Emperour</HI> sixty years be∣fore
<HI>Tertullian</HI> wrote his books against <HI>Marcion,</HI> says,
this Census was performed in <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Cyrenius;</HI> and
all other writers agree with <HI>Justin,</HI> as has been shewn
already.</P>
<P>(3.)<HI>TERTULLIAN</HI>'s authority is of the less
weight in this point, because he has made very gross
blunders in history, of which I shall say somewhat more
in the <HI>third</HI> chapter.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="450"/>
(4.) I IMAGINE some account may be given of this
mistake of <HI>Tartullian.</HI> It has been observed, that <HI>Mar∣cion,</HI>
whom <HI>Tertullian</HI> was now arguing with, did not
own the first chapters of St. <HI>Luke</HI>' Gospel. <HI>Tertullian</HI>
therefore not having his eye particularly on St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
and supposing that this Census was made in <HI>Judea</HI> when
<HI>Saturninus</HI> was president of <HI>Syria,</HI> says, it was made by
him.</P>
<P><HI>JUDEA</HI> having been afterwards a branch of the
province of <HI>Syria,</HI> he concluded it was so at this time,
and that therefore the Census must have been made by
the President of <HI>Syria.</HI> But this was arguing from later
to more early times, as men not thoroughly versed in
history are apt to do.</P>
<P>AFTER the banishment of <HI>Archelaus Judea</HI> was an∣nexed
to <HI>Syria.</HI> But whilst <HI>Herod</HI> was living, the presi∣dent
of <HI>Syria</HI> had not any proper authority in <HI>Judea,</HI>
The President of <HI>Syria</HI> was always the most considera∣ble
officer in the Eastern part of the Empire. When
the <HI>Romans</HI> had any war<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tum intellecto Barbarorum irrisu, qui peterent quod eripue∣rant, Consuluit inter primores civitatis Nero, <HI>bellum anceps an pax inhonesta placeret,</HI> nee dubitatum de BELLO.—scribitur tetrarchi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ac regibus praefectisque ac procuratoribus,—<HI>jussis Corbulonis obsequi. Tacit. Ann.</HI> 15. cap. 25.</NOTE> in that part of the world,
the neighbouring Kings were obliged to follow his di∣rections,
to furnish those sums of money, or those troops
which he required, and to send these to the places he
appointed. When any differences happened between
these Kings and Tetrarchs, they were bound to refer
them to him, nor could they march any forces out of
their territories without his consent. But he seems not,
especially in a time of peace, to have had any proper
authority within their dominions.</P>
<P>NOR do I think I here impute to <HI>Tertullian</HI> any very
gross mistake. The state of dependent kingdoms and
provinces in the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> underwent frequent
changes. And a person had need to have made history
his peculiar study, and to have aimed at some uncom∣mon
<PB N="433" REF="451"/>
accuracy, in order to understand the state of the
Roman provinces for a couple of centuries.</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone through all the difficulties which
are of any moment in this point.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing farther to add to those evidences
which I have already produced, except these two ob∣servations:
Ist, That it seems to me highly probable
from the manner in which <HI>Eusebius</HI> speaks of this mat∣ter
in his chronicles, that it was originally the common
opinion of Christians, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was sent into <HI>Judea</HI>
on purpose to make this census: “In the thirty third
year of <HI>Herod, Cyrenius</HI> being sent by the Roman Se∣nate
made a Census (or <HI>enrolments</HI>) of goods and per∣sons
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. pag. 76.</NOTE>.” This does very much confirm the opinion
of those learned men, who think, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was sent
with extraordinary power: Though why <HI>Eusebius</HI> men∣tions
the <HI>Senate</HI> instead of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> I know not.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY some may be disposed to set aside <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s
authority, because in his <HI>Ecclesiastical Hisiory</HI> he has
confounded the two surveys. But I must confesse, I a∣scribe
that, not to ignorance, but to somewhat a great
deal worse. It is impossible, that a man of <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s
acutenesse, who had the <HI>New Testament</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI>
before him, should think a Census made after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
banishment was the same with that made before <HI>Herod</HI>
died. But <HI>Ensebius</HI> was resolved to have St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s hi∣story
confirmed by the express testimony of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
Historian, right or wrong. Here <HI>Eusebius</HI> was under a
biasse. In his Chronicle we have a simple unbiassed
account of what was the opinion of Christians and others
at that time.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT seems to me in the nature of the thing
most probable, that some person was sent with extraor∣dinary
power to make this enrolment. There is no evi∣dence
in <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Augustus</HI> had any intention to
take away the kingdome from <HI>Herod</HI> and make <HI>Judea</HI>
a province. A census in his dominions was a very great
<PB N="434" REF="452"/>
disgrace. But to have ordered it to be performed by
the President of <HI>Syria</HI> would have been an additional
affront. It would have looked like making <HI>Herod</HI> sub∣ject
to <HI>Syria.</HI> Since <HI>Judea</HI> was to continue a distinct
kingdome, as hitherto, and only to be reduced to a
more strict dependence, the only method of making
this census could be that of sending some person of ho∣nour
and dignity, like <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> to enrole the subjects
of <HI>Herod,</HI> and value their estates, that for the future,
tribute might be paid according to this census. And
this does admirably suit the nature of the oath mention∣ed
in <HI>Josephus,</HI> the substance of which was to be faith∣ful
to <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>I CONCLUDE therefore, that it is upon the whole
most probable, that the first assessment, of which St
<HI>Luke</HI> here writes, was performed by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> as well
as the second. This appears to me a very natural mean∣ing
of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words, and the external evidences so:
this supposition seem to me to outweigh the objections.</P>
<P>WE have now got through the affair of the census,
If I have not been so happy as to remove every difficul∣ty
attending this text of St. <HI>Luke;</HI> yet I hope the rea∣der
will allow at lest, that I have not concealed or dis∣sembled
any.</P>

<P>IT is objected to this, That if there had been so cruel
a daughter made by <HI>Herod,</HI> of innocent infants at <HI>Beth∣lahem,</HI>
a place not far from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> it is very unlike∣ly
it should have been omitted by <HI>Josephus,</HI> who has
writ the history of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and particularly of the
reign of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer: I. This appears to me to be at
the best an objection of a very extraordinary nature.
The mod exact and diligent historians have omitted
many Events, that happened within the compasse of
those times of which they undertook to write. Nor
does the reputation which any one historian his for ex∣actnesse
invalidate the credit of another, who seems to
be well informed of the facts he relates. <HI>Suetonius, Ta∣titus,</HI>
and <HI>Dio Cassius,</HI> have all three written of the reign
of <HI>Tiberius:</HI> but it is no objection against the veracity of
any one of them, that he has mentioned some things of
that Emperour, which have been omitted by the rest.
<PB N="436" REF="454"/>
No more is it any objection against St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> that
he has related an action of <HI>Herod,</HI> not mentioned by
<HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>2. THERE have been as great cruelties committed
by many Eastern Princes: nor was there ever any man
more likely than <HI>Herod</HI> to give the orders here mention∣ed
by St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> When he had gained possession of
<HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jos. Ant. I. xiv. c. 16. §. ult.</NOTE> by the assistance of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and
his rival <HI>Antigonus</HI> was taken prisoner, and in the hands
of the <HI>Roman</HI> General <HI>Sasius,</HI> and by him carried to
<HI>Mark Antony, Herod</HI> by a large sum of money per∣swaded
<HI>Antony</HI> to put him to death. <HI>Herod</HI>'s great fear
was, that <HI>Antigonus</HI> might some time revive his preten∣sions,
as being of the <HI>Asmonean</HI> family. <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> bro∣ther
of his wife <HI>Mariamne,</HI> was murdered<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 15. c. 3. §. 3. De Bell. l. i. c. 22.</NOTE> by his
directions at eighteen years of age, because the people
at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had shewn some affection for his person.
In the seventh year of his reign from the death of <HI>Anti∣gonus,</HI>
he put to death <HI>Hyrcanus,</HI> grandfather of <HI>Ma∣riamne,</HI>
then eighty years of age, and who had saved
<HI>Herod</HI>'s life when he was prosecuted by the Sanhedrim;
a man, who in his youth, and in the vigour of his life,
and in all the revolutions of his fortune, had shewn a
mild and peaceable disposition<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ant. 15. c. 6. de Bell. ubi supra.</NOTE> His beloved wife,
the beautiful and virtuous <HI>Mariamne,</HI> had a publick ex∣ecution
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ant. 15. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 7. § 5, 6.</NOTE>, and her mother <HI>Alexandra</HI> was put to
death soon after<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ib. §. 8.</NOTE>. <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> his
two sons by <HI>Mariamne,</HI> were strangled in prison by his
order<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 16. c. 11. §. 6. de B. l. i. c. 27.</NOTE> upon groundlesse suspicions, as it seems, when
they were at man's estate, were married and had chil∣dren.
I say nothing of the death of his eldest son <HI>Anti∣pater.</HI>
If <HI>Josephus</HI>'s character of him be just, he was a
miscreant, and deserved the worst death that could be
inflicted.</P>
<P>IN his last sicknesse, a little before he died, he sent
orders throughout <HI>Judea,</HI> requiring the presence of all
<PB N="437" REF="455"/>
the chief men of the nation at <HI>Jericho.</HI> His orders
were obeyed, for they were enforced with no less pe∣nalty
than that of death. When these men were come
to <HI>Jericho,</HI> he had them all shut up in the <HI>Circus,</HI> and
calling for his sister <HI>Salome</HI> and her husband <HI>Alexas,</HI> he
told them: “My life is now but short, I know the dis∣positions
of the <HI>jewish</HI> people, and nothing will please
them more than my death. You have<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de Bell. i. c. 33. §. 6.</NOTE> these men
in your custody; as soon as the breath is out of my
body, and before my death can be known, do you
let in the soldiers upon them and kill them. All <HI>Ju∣dea</HI>
and every family will then, though unwillingly,
mourn at my death.” Nay, <HI>Josephus</HI> says, “That
with tears in his eyes he conjured them by their love
to him and their fidelity to God, not to fail of doing
him this honour: And they promised<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. c. vi. §. 5.</NOTE> they
would not fail.”</P>
<P>THESE orders indeed were not executed. But, as a
modern historian of very good sense observes, “The
history of this his mod wicked design takes off all ob∣jection
against the truth of murdering the innocents,
which may be made from the incredibility of so
barbarous and horrid an act. For this thoroughly
shews, that there can nothing be imagined so cruel,
barbarous, and horrid, which this man was not ca∣pable
of doing<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Prideaux Conn. Part ii. p. 655.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT may be also proper to observe, that almost all
the executions that I have instanced in were sacrifices to
his state jealousy, and love of empire. And the slaugh∣ter,
which St. <HI>Matthew</HI> has given an account of, was
made upon the occasion of tidings brought to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
of the birth of one who was <HI>King of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="456"/>
3. <HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has given us an account of a
terrible execution made in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court, and at <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
about this very time, upon the occasion of some
predictions, that God was about to take away the king∣dome
from <HI>Herod</HI> I think it was made at the very
same time with the slaughter of the infants. St. <HI>Mat∣thew</HI>
relates only what was done at <HI>Bethlehem, Josephus</HI>
what happened at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The silence of <HI>Josephus</HI>
about the former, and of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> about the latter,
may be in a good measure accounted for by these two
or three considerations.</P>
<P>(I.) ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> was not concerned to relate state
matters, but barely to give the history of Jesus Christ;
and therefore all that he was obliged to take notice of
upon this occasion was the attempts made upon the life
of Jesus. <HI>Josephus</HI>'s is apolitical history of the <HI>jewish</HI>
nation, and therefore the executions at Court might be
more suitable to his design.</P>
<P>(2.) ALL writers of good sense and candour, who have
writ the history of such jealous and cruel princes as <HI>He∣rod,</HI>
have been obliged, both out of a regard to them∣selves,
and their readers, to omit some of their odious
and offensive actions, and to pass by some parts or cir∣cumstances
of those transactions which they mention<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Neque sum ignarus, a plerisque scriptoribus omissa multorum pericula &amp; pocnas, dam copiâ fatiscunt, aut quae ipsis nimia &amp; maesta suerant, ne pari taedio lecturos adsicerent, verentur. Tacit. An. I. 6. c. 7.</NOTE>.
And I cannot help paying a particular respect to the
Evangelists for the many instances of their candour and
goodnesse, and for this in particular, that they have
none of them strove to brand the memory of <HI>Herod,</HI>
who fought the life of Jesus, with the many cruelties
of his reign, nor the dreadful circumstances of his death;
and that <HI>Matthew,</HI> who alone has informed us of the
murder of the infants, confined his narration to that,
and passed by all the other tokens, which, I doubt not,
<HI>Herod</HI> shewed at this time, of a most odious jealousy.</P>
<P>NOR would I blame <HI>Josephus</HI> barely for the omissi∣on
of the barbarities committed at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> He has
<PB N="439" REF="457"/>
related many cruel transactions of <HI>Herod.</HI> To have re∣lated
them all would probably have appear'd spite and ill
will, rather than faithfulness or impartiality. It is evi∣dent,
there were many put to death at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> beside
those he names in the account of that execution. Possi∣bly
the omission of the murder of the Infants may be
owing to those reasons I have here hinted, namely a fear
of being charged with a design to load <HI>Herod</HI> unreasona∣bly,
or a fear of rendering his history disagreeable by
too particular a detaile of cruel actions.</P>
<P>(3.) I HAVE thus far endeavoured to account for <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>'s
silence in the way of apology for him, and should
be glad to leave the matter here: but his strange way of
speaking, and that in two<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">One of those passages with observations upon it may be seen above, p. 367. It is the passage I referred to, p. 172, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as deserv∣ing a <HI>particular attention.</HI> If the reader has not yet observed it, I would now recommend it to his perusal. The other passage will be found toward the later end of §. I. of the next chapter to this. See in the index <HI>Josephus, his account of a terrible execution at</HI> Jerusalem.</NOTE> places of his works, of
in execution at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> about this time, though ac∣cording
to his own account and acknowledgement it
was very severe and terrible, will not permit me to con∣clude
here. Supposing then, that execution to have
been made on account of discourses, which happened
at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> upon the rumour of the birth of Jesus, I
think, that since <HI>Josephus</HI> was determined in the main
to vindicate <HI>Herod</HI> upon that occasion, he was obliged
for his own honour to say nothing of what was done at
<HI>Bethlehem.</HI> The slaughter of the infants from two years
old and under, of a whole city, town, or village, and
the district round about it, whatever colours an histo∣rian
might have put upon it, would have appeared to
all mankind, but prejudiced and hardened <HI>Jews,</HI> an
horrid inhumanity.</P>
<P>IN a word, the objection against this relation of St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> must be founded on the silence of the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Roman</HI> historians, or of <HI>Josiphus.</HI> As for the si∣lence
of the former; The <HI>Roman</HI> Republick or Em∣pire
<PB N="440" REF="458"/>
about this time was so vast, that the affairs of ma∣ny
dependent princes have been lost in the crowd. <HI>Ta∣citus</HI>
goes over the history of the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Pompey</HI>'s
conquest of <HI>Judea</HI> to the government of <HI>Felix,</HI> mention∣ed
in the <HI>Acts,</HI> in one short chapter. Of <HI>Herod</HI> he says:
“The kingdome he received from <HI>Antonie</HI> was enlarged
[or confirmed] by <HI>Augustus.</HI> And that after his
death his Kingdom was divided between three of his
sons<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Regnum ab Antonio Herodi datum, victor Augustus auxit [<HI>al. sanxit</HI>]. Post mortem Herodis, nihil expectato Caesare, Simon quidem regium nomen invaserat. Is a Quinctilio Varo obtinente Syriam puni∣tus. Et gentsm coercitim liberi Herodis tripartito rexere. Tacit: Hist. I. v. c. 9.</NOTE>. Without so much as naming the sons of <HI>He∣rod,</HI>
who arrived at Sovereign power, and succecded
their father. <HI>Strabo</HI> says, “<HI>Herod</HI> obtained the title of
king first from <HI>Antonie,</HI> and then from <HI>Augustus.</HI>
Some of his sons he put to death, as guilty of designs
against himself: others he appointed his successors,
dividing his kingdom among them. But his sons were
not happy, for they fell under some accusations. One
of them was banished into <HI>Gaul,</HI> and the other two by
means of? a great deal of submission with much dif∣ficulty
kept their several tetrachies<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Strabo. l. 16. p. 765. ed. Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub.</NOTE>.” He does
rot so much as name those sons whom <HI>Herod</HI> killed, nor
those that succeeded him.'Tis with a like brevity that
some other writers have mentioned <HI>Herod. Dio Cassius</HI>'s
history of affairs about the latter part of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign
is wanting. I leave it to any one to judge, whether it be
reasonable to expect the particular fact at <HI>Bethlehem</HI>
from historians, who plainly content themselves with
delivering the successions of princes, without relating
their affairs, or so much as recording all their names.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="459"/>
As for <HI>Josephus;</HI> his silence is no more an objection
against St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> than the silence of other writers is
against him. <HI>Josephus</HI> has said a great deal of <HI>Herod</HI>'s
liberality to foreigners, to <HI>Antioch, Berytum, Tyrus,
Sidon, Damascus,</HI> and may other cities in <HI>Syria;</HI> to the
<HI>Athenians, Lacedemonians, Rhodians,</HI> and other people of
<HI>Greece.</HI> Of his benefaction to the <HI>Eleans,</HI> he says, “It was
a common benefit not to <HI>Greece</HI> only but to all the
world<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Antiq. I. 16. c. 5. §. 3, 4. de Bell. l. I. c. 21. §. 11, 12. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. §. 12.</NOTE>:” and “that he was so remarkable for his
liberality, that <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Agrippa</HI> often said, <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
kingdome was too small for him, and that he
deserved to be King of all <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. l. 16. c. 5. §. I.</NOTE>.” I
suppose people take these things upon <HI>Josephus</HI>'s autho∣rity.
I cannot conceive how the single silence of <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
(and of <HI>Justus</HI> of <HI>Tiberias</HI> if you please to add him)
should be an objection against St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> when the
silence of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Syrians,</HI> people that abounded
so much in writers (several of which are also still in be∣ing)
is no objection against <HI>Josephus:</HI> who has record∣ed
many things done by <HI>Herod</HI> for those people, of
which they have made no mention, that we know of.</P>
<P>IT has been pretended indeed, that <HI>Josephus</HI> was a
great enemy to <HI>Herod,</HI> and seems willing to tell all his
various acts of cruelty. But this is not certain, for <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
character in <HI>Josephus</HI> has a mixture of good and
bad. He has related a great many things to his advan∣tage,
which can be verified by no other writers. <HI>Herod</HI>
put to death every member of the <HI>jewish</HI> great Council
in <HI>Hyrcanus</HI>'s time, except <HI>Hillel</HI> and <HI>Shammai;</HI> yet
<HI>Josephus</HI> mentions this very slightly<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xiv. c. 9. §. 4. xv. I.</NOTE>. He even takes
part with <HI>Herod</HI> against the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in an account of
an execution made at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the later part of his
reign. Though <HI>Josephus</HI> were an enemy to <HI>Herod,</HI> he
<PB N="442" REF="460"/>
might have inducements to shew him savour upon some
occasions. <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger was living, when <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
wrote; and he had some acquaintance with him,
and obligations to him<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Joseph. vit. §. 65.</NOTE>. It was not for the honour
of the <HI>jewish</HI> nation to make a mere monster of <HI>Herod,</HI>
who had reigned over them between thirty and forty
years. A particular recital of all <HI>Herod</HI>'s cruelties could
not but make the uneasinesse of the <HI>jewish</HI> people under
the <HI>Roman</HI> government appear very unreasonable. They
might be thought a strange people who rebelled against
the <HI>Romans,</HI> and yet had bore with a man who had
spared neither young nor old; who had slaughtered all
the members of their great council, and the innocent
infants of a whole town and all its district. I have some∣times
thought, that this was really one reason, why <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
made so flight mention of the cutting off the
members of chat senate. It might also be some induce∣ment
not to relate the slaughter of the infants.</P>
<P>But <HI>Josephus,</HI> as a firm <HI>Jew,</HI> had certainly a parti∣cular
reason for passing over this event at <HI>Bethlehem:</HI>
He could not mention it without giving the <HI>Christian</HI>
cause a great advantage. To write, that <HI>Herod</HI> at the
latter end of his reign had put to death all the young
children at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> on occasion of a report spread at
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that the <HI>King of the Jews</HI> had been newly
born there, would have greatly gratified the Christians;
since it was well known, when he wrote, that about thir∣ty
years after the death of <HI>Herod, Jesus,</HI> being then
about thirty years of age, had been stiled the <HI>King of
the Jews,</HI> and had been publickly crucified at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
with that title, and it wax firmly believed by all his
followers that he was the great person spoke of under
that character, and was now advanced to dominion and
power.</P>
<P>NAY, I don't see how any serious and attentive Hea∣then,
who had heard any thing of <HI>Jesus,</HI> could read a
relation of this event in <HI>Josephus</HI> (a <HI>Jewish</HI> historian,
known to be no favourer of those called <HI>Christians</HI>) but
<PB N="443" REF="461"/>
he must be disposed to think, the <HI>Christian</HI> belief de∣served
some consideration. For if there was a report
spread at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Capital city of <HI>Judea,</HI> that
the <HI>King of the Jews</HI> had been newly born; and if this
report was so far credited, that <HI>Herod,</HI> notwithstanding
his numerous issue, thought it needful to make away
with all the young children at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and its bor∣ders,
in order to secure the succession in his own family:
this is at once a strong argument, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> ex∣pectation
of a great person to arise from among them
is no new thing, and that there were some reasons to
think that great person had been born at that time.
Moreover, he must also suppose it possible, that the
Child, whose life was aimed at, escaped, notwithstand∣ing
the care of <HI>Herod.</HI> For it is plain, he did not cer∣tainly
know the child, of whom the discourse was: if
he had, he would not have given orders for destroying
all the young children under such an age.</P>
<P>THE more any Heathen knew of the <HI>jewish</HI> expec∣tations,
or of the story of <HI>Jesus,</HI> either by hearsay
from the <HI>Christians,</HI> or by having looked into any of
the Gospels, the more would he have remarked such a
relation in this historian.</P>
<P>FOR this reason <HI>Josephus</HI> could by no means be wil∣ling
to relate this event, with its most: peculiar circum∣stances;
though I think he has given a general account
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s cruelty at that time, as I have sufficiently
shewn already.</P>
<P>4. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s account is confirmed by the testi∣mony
of ancient Christian authors. I give one passage
from <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who wrote before the middle of
the second century. “But, says he, <HI>Herod,</HI> when the
<HI>Arabian</HI> wise men did not come back to him as he
had desired them, but according to a command gi∣ven
them returned by another way into their own
country, and when <HI>Joseph</HI> together with <HI>Mary</HI> and
the young child were gone into <HI>Egypt,</HI> according to di∣rections
given to them also by a divine revelation,
not knowing the child whom the wise men had come
<PB N="444" REF="462"/>
to worship, commanded all the children in <HI>Bethlehem</HI>
without exception to be killed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dialog. Part ii. p. 304. Paris. (p. 307. Thilb.)</NOTE>. This was pro∣phesied
of by <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> the spirit of God saying by

<P>THIS event is also mentioned by <HI>Irenaus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Propter hoc &amp; pueros eripiebat, qui erant in domo David, bene fortiti in illo tempore nasci, ut eos praemitteret in suum regnum; ipse infans cum esset, infantes hominum martyres parans, propter Chri∣stum, qui in Bethlehem natus est Judae, in civitate David, interfectos secundum scripturas. <HI>Contra Haer.</HI> l. iii. c. 16. §. 4. al. c. 17.

lived in the same century; and by <HI>Origen</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, l. I. p. 47.</NOTE> in the
third century, in his answer to <HI>Celsus,</HI> where he says:
“<HI>Herod</HI> put to death all the little children in <HI>Bethlehem</HI>
and its borders, with a design to destroy the <HI>King of
Jews,</HI> who had been born there.”'Tis needless to
make any more quotations of <HI>Christian</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vid. Euseb. Hist. Ec. l. i. e. 8. P. Oros. 1. vii. c. 3, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> writers.</P>
<P>THERE is also a noted passage in <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a Heathen
author, who flourished in the latter end of the fourth
century, who among other jests of <HI>Augustus</HI> has this:
“When he [<HI>Augustus</HI>] had heard that among the chil∣dren
within two years of age, which <HI>Herod</HI> King of
the <HI>Jews</HI> commanded to be slain in <HI>Syria,</HI> his own
son had been killed, he said: <HI>It is better to be He∣rod's
hog than his son</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cam audisset inter pueros, quos in Syria Herodes Rex Judaeo∣rum bimatum jussit interfici, filium quoque ejus occisum; ait, <HI>Neiius est Herodis porcum esse quam filium.</HI> Macrob. Sat. lib. ii. c.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>I LAY little or no stresse upon this passage, partly
because it comes too late, partly because there is reason
to suppose, <HI>Macrobius</HI> has been mistaken about the occa∣sion
of the jest. No early Christian writers have laid
any thing of <HI>Herod</HI>'s having had a young child of his
own killed in the slaughter at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> If <HI>Augustus</HI> did
pass this jest upon <HI>Herod,</HI> it might be occasioned by
<PB N="445" REF="463"/>
the death of <HI>Antipater,</HI> or rather of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Ari∣stobulus</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Doctor <HI>Whitby</HI>'s Annot on Matth. ii. 16, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS is what I said of this passage in the first edition.
I would now add: It ought to be allowed, that <HI>Augu∣stus</HI>
did pass this jest upon <HI>Herod,</HI> upon some occasion
or other, and that <HI>Macrobius</HI> has given us exactly the
words of the jest. This passage also shews, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s
slaughter of the infants in <HI>Judea</HI> was a thing well
known in <HI>Macrobius</HI>'s time, and was not contested by
Heathens.</P>
<P>IF we could be assured, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> transcribed
this whole passage, not only the jest it self, but the oc∣casion
of it likewise, from some more ancient author,
it would be a proof, that this event was well known in
that author's time also. And we should have a great
deal of reason to suppose, that author was a Heathen;
because'tis most likely, that <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a bigotted
Heathen<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">This is very evident from his works. And the reader may see a full proof of it in the Rev. Mr. <HI>Masson</HI>'s slaughter of the children in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> as an historical fact, vindicated. §. 3.</NOTE> himself, did not much deal in Christian
writers.</P>
<P>BUT it is possible, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> found only the
jest in his author, and added the occasion, having col∣lected
it from the common discourse of the Christians of
his time, who frequently spoke of this cruel action of
<HI>Herod.</HI> There is some reason to suspect this, because
'tis very likely that <HI>Augustus</HI>'s reflexion upon <HI>Herod</HI> was
occasioned by the death of one of those sons whom <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
has mentioned; and that it has no relation at all
to the slaughter of the infants at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> This suspi∣cion
may be farther strengthened by the great agree∣ment
of <HI>Macrobius</HI> with St. <HI>Matthew</HI> in the words
he uses concerning the children<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Children within two years of age, which <HI>Herod</HI> King of the <HI>Jews</HI> commanded to be slain.</NOTE> <HI>Macrobius</HI> being
ignorant of <HI>Herod</HI>'s story, and having heard of the
slaughter of the infants; when he met with this jest in
<PB N="446" REF="464"/>
some author, concluded there had been some young
child of <HI>Herod</HI> put to death together with them.</P>
<P>I AM content therefore to leave it a doubtful point
whether <HI>Macrobius</HI> transcribed this whole passage, or
the jest only, from some more ancient author.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, there lies no objection against
this relation of St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> There is nothing impro∣bable
in the thing it self, considering the jealous, cruel
temper of <HI>Herod.</HI> The silence of <HI>Josephus,</HI> or of the
ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> historians, can be no difficul∣ty
with any reasonable person. This fact is confirmed
by the express testimony of very early Christian wri∣ters,
and by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a Heathen author in the latter
end of the fourth century; from whom it appears, that
this event was not then contested, and that it was even
better known, than the fate of those sons of <HI>Herod,</HI>
whom <HI>Josephus</HI> says he put to death at man's estate.</P>
<P>§. II. AN objection, of the like fort with that
have been considering, may be made against St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
who says; <HI>There were present at that season, some that
told him of the</HI> Galileans, <HI>whose blood</HI> Pilate <HI>had mingled
with their sacrifices,</HI> Luke xiii. I. It has been thought
strange by some, that <HI>Josephus</HI> has made no mention of
this event.</P>
<P>IN answer to this objection, I shall transcribe a pas∣sage
of <HI>Josephus.</HI> “<HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean</HI> introduced a
fourth sect among the <HI>Jews.</HI> In all other things they
agree with the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> but they have an invincible
love of liberty, and acknowledge God alone their
Lord and Governour. Nor can any kind of death,
or any punishments of their friends and relations make
them call any man Lord. As many have been wit∣nesses
of their immoveable firmnesse, I shall say no
more upon this head: not out of a fear, left my ac∣counts
should be thought incredible, but rather be∣cause
it is not easy fully to represent their contempt
of all kinds of sufferings<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. l. 18. c. I. §. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="465"/>
PERHAPS the <HI>Galileans</HI> mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> were
some of the followers of the before mentioned <HI>Judas.
Josephus</HI> says he has omitted the greatest part of the
sufferings of sect. I think it is not difficult to
grasse the reason. <HI>Judas</HI>'s principles were very popu∣lar
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but in the opinion of the <HI>Romans</HI>
they were criminal, as being inconsistent with sub∣jection
to their government. And it was next to im∣possible,
for <HI>Josephus</HI> to give a particular account of all
transaction in <HI>Judea</HI> relating to this matter, without
offending the <HI>Jews</HI> his countrymen on the one hand, or
the <HI>Romans</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>BUT whether the <HI>Galileans</HI> in St. <HI>Luke</HI> were men of
this principle, is not certain; nor is it material. For
though they were not, the passage just transcribed from
<HI>Josephus</HI> may satisfie us, that many remarkable events
have been omitted by him upon some account or
other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An objection against the Fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius compared with the age of
Jesus at his Baptism.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">I. The Objection stated. II. The first solution: That
St. Luke, by the fifteenth of Tiberius, might intend
the fifteenth of his Proconsular power, not of his sole
empire after the death of Augustus. III. The con∣sistence
of other notes of time in the Gospels with this
supposition. IV. The second solution: That the age of
thirty years ascribed to Jesus at his baptism may be
understood with latitude.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ST.</HI> Luke <HI>says:</HI> Now in the <HI>FIFTEENTH
YEAR OF THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS CESAR,
Pontius Pilate</HI> being governour of <HI>Judea.</HI>—
the word of God came unto <HI>John</HI> the son of
<HI>Zacharias</HI> in the wildernesse, <HI>Luke</HI> iii. 1, 2.
—Now when all the people were baptized,
it came to passe, that Jesus also being baptized, and pray∣ing,
the heaven was opened: And the Holy Ghost descended
in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came
from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son, in
thee I am well pleased. And Jesus himself—<HI>BEGAN TO
BE ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE,</HI> ver. 21.</P>
<P>AGAINST this account of St. <HI>Luke</HI> this objection
may be formed. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> says expressly, that Jesus
was <HI>born in</HI> Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea <HI>in the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the
king.</HI> But, though Jesus was born but a month or two
before the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> he would be at lest thirty
one years of age at his baptism. But if Jesus was born
above a year, much more, if above two years before
<PB N="449" REF="467"/>
<HI>Herod</HI>'s death, then the age of <HI>thirty years</HI> here ascribed
to him at his baptism is absolutely inconsistent with the
notes of time mentioned at the commencement of <HI>John the
Biptist</HI>'s ministry: even allowing, that <HI>the word of God
came to John</HI> in the very beginning of the <HI>fifteenth year of
Tiberius,</HI> and that Jesus was baptized a few months after.</P>
<P>BEFORE I state this objection at length, I would ob∣serve, that the true genuine meaning of these words,
<HI>Jesus himself</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>began to be about thirty years of age,</HI>
is not that he then <HI>entered</HI> the thirtieth year of his age,
but that Jesus was about thirty years of age when he be∣gan
his ministry: or <HI>when</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Paraphrase.</NOTE> <HI>he thus began to shew him∣self
publickly.</HI> This, I think, is now the general opinion
of<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lucae mentcm Janse∣nius [Cone. cap. 14.] optimè affecutus est, quam sic exprimit: <HI>Sensus crit, &amp; ipse Jesus erat fere triginta annorum, eum jam suscepto baptismo auspicaretur deinde nunus suum.</HI> Bas.

So the <HI>Greek</HI> word of this text is
used by St. <HI>Luke</HI> in other places. Thus the High Priests

<P>I COME now to the objection: <HI>Augustus</HI> died and
<HI>Tiberius</HI> succeeded him the 19th of <HI>August,</HI> A. U. 767,
<HI>Julian</HI> year 59, A. D. 14. Therefore the fifteenth of
<HI>Tiberius</HI> began the 19th <HI>Aug.</HI> A. U. 781, A. D. 28.
<HI>Herod</HI> died<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE> before the Passover in A. U. 750, <HI>Jul.</HI>
<PB N="450" REF="468"/>
year 42, or else before the Passover in A. U. 751, <HI>Jul,</HI>
year 43. If then <HI>John the Baptist</HI> began to preach in
the beginning of the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> in the latter
end of A. U. 781, and Jesus be supposed to have been
baptized by <HI>John</HI> a few months after, on the 6th of
<HI>January</HI> of the year following, <HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 782; Jesus
must have been in the 32d year of his life, if <HI>Herod</HI> died
in the Spring, A. U. 751, and if Jesus was born the
25th <HI>Decemb.</HI> preceding, <HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 750. But if <HI>He∣rod</HI>
died A. U. 750, and Jesus was born the 25th <HI>De∣cemb.</HI>
before, <HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 749, then he would be at his
baptism in the 33d year of his age.</P>
<P>BUT it may be made appear several ways, that Jesus
was born above a year, probably above two years be∣fore
<HI>Herod</HI> died.</P>
<P>1. THIS may be inferred from the Evangelists them∣selves.
For it is very probable that <HI>Herod</HI> lived a year
or more after the murder of the infants. The wise men
having worshipped Jesus, when they were departed,
<HI>Behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mo∣ther
and flee into</HI> Egypt, AND BE THOU THERE UNTIL
I BRING THEE WORD: <HI>for</HI> Herod <HI>will seek the young child
to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and
his mother by night, and departed into</HI> Egypt. <HI>And was
there</HI> UNTIL THE DEATH OF HEROD, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 13, 14.
The direction given to <HI>Joseph</HI> by the angel, may af∣ford
ground to suppose, that <HI>Joseph</HI> was to make some
stay in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at lest some months, or more than a few
weeks or days: which, from what follows, appears to
have been <HI>till the death of</HI> Herod.</P>
<P><HI>MOREOVER St.</HI> Matthew <HI>says, that</HI> when <HI>Herod</HI>
was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to <HI>Jo∣seph</HI>
in a dream in <HI>Egypt,</HI> saying, Arise, take the young
child and his mother, and go into the land of <HI>Israel: FOR
THEY ARE DEAD WHICH SOUGHT THE YOUNG CHILD'S
LIFE,</HI> ver: 19, 20.</P>
<P>IT being known from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Antipater</HI> died
but five days before his father <HI>Herod;</HI> it may be infer∣red
<PB N="451" REF="469"/>
from the use of the plural number, that <HI>Antipater</HI>
is meant by the angel as well as <HI>Herod,</HI> and that he
had been concerned in the design to put Jesus to death,
and that his cruel intentions were one cause of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s
removal out of <HI>Judea</HI> into <HI>Egypt.</HI> But <HI>Antipater</HI> could
have no influence on his father's counsels for ten months
or more before <HI>Herod</HI> died, as will appear presently:
therefore the murder of the infants happened, most
probably, a year before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>IT may likewise be concluded from St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s
account, that Jesus was born near two years before the
murder of the infants. For thus he says: <HI>Now when
Jesus was born in</HI> Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea, <HI>in the days of</HI> He∣rod
<HI>the king: Behold, there came wise men from the east
to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>saying, Where is he that is born king of the
Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are
cone to worship him,</HI> Matth. iii. 1, 2.—<HI>Then</HI> Herod,
<HI>when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them
diligently what time the star appeared,</HI> v. 7.</P>
<P><HI>THE wise men having been to worship the child, and
departing into their own country without coming back.
to</HI> Jerusalem, Then <HI>Herod</HI> when he saw that he was mock∣ed
of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth,
and slew all the children that were in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> and in all
the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according
to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men,
<HI>ver.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>JESUS was born before the wise men came, for their
question was: <HI>Where is he that is born?</HI> They knew
he was born, because they had seen his star in the east.
<HI>Herod</HI> enquired what time the star appeared, and slew
all the children from two years and under, according
to that time. Therefore the star had appeared two
years before, and Jesus was born at or near that time.</P>
<P>NOR can the supposed distance between the appear∣ing
of the star and the arrival of the wise men weaken
this calculation. There might be many reasons to hin∣der
their undertaking the journey immediately: Possi∣bly,
they apprehended no necessity of setting out soon∣er
<PB N="452" REF="470"/>
For allowing the truth of the fact, that they
had seen a star by which they understood the birth of
a king in <HI>Judea,</HI> they could not well make any doubt
of his living, or of their having an opportunity to wor∣ship
him, though they delayed a year or two, But,
whatever were the reasons of their delay, we have no
right to depart from the words of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> who
intimates very plainly, that it was <HI>two years</HI> from the
appearing of the Star to the time in which <HI>Herod</HI> or∣dered
the children to be slain.</P>
<P>ADD these two years to the forementioned year,
which <HI>Herod</HI> lived after the slaughter of the children;
and it will appear, that according to St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> Jesus
was born three years before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>2. IT may be proved from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that Jesus was
born above two years before the death of <HI>Herod:</HI> for
he says, that the census or tax made in <HI>Judea,</HI> at the time
of which Jesus was born, was made<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Adv. Marc. lib. iv. cap. 19. See above, p. 430.</NOTE> by <HI>Sentius Satur∣minus.</HI>
But <HI>Josephus</HI> assures us, that <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> was
come into <HI>Syria</HI> as Successor to <HI>Saturninus,</HI> before<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Antiq. xvii. c. 5. §. 2. &amp; alibi.</NOTE>
the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> It may not be easy to determine ex∣actly
from <HI>Josephus</HI> the time of <HI>Varus</HI>'s arrival in <HI>Syria:</HI>
But there are in being some ancient Coins<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Scripsit ad me Card.

and inscription, with the numerals xxvi, xxvii. The
first of these coins assures us, that <HI>Varus</HI> was in <HI>Syria</HI>
before <HI>September</HI> A. U. 748. For the Aera which the
<PB N="453" REF="471"/>
<HI>Antiochians</HI> used at that time was that of the Actiac Vic∣tory,
which was obtained A. U. 723.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Allix</HI> supposes the <HI>Antiochian</HI> Era of the Actiac Victory does not begin till A. U. 724. Vid. Differt. de J. C.

The 25th
year of this Aera ended the second of <HI>Sept.</HI> A. U. 748.
It is therefore manifest that Jesus was born before <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>
in that year, if <HI>Saturninus</HI> made the census of
which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks, or if it was made in his time.
And if it be supposed, that Jesus was born on the 25th
day of <HI>December,</HI> then his nativity must necessarily be
placed as far back as the 25th <HI>Decemb.</HI> A. U. 747.</P>
<P>3. I EXPECT likewise to be here reminded of some
things advanced by me in the first chapter of this book;
and that it will be urged: If the oath which <HI>Josephus</HI>
says was taken by all the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> re∣late
to the census or enrolment which St. <HI>Luke</HI> speaks
of, then Jesus must have been born about three years
before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>POSSIBLY the objection may be stated in this manner:
IT cannot be less than ten months from the com∣mencement
of the enquiries made by <HI>Herod</HI> into the
cause of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death and the crimes of <HI>Antipater</HI> to the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI> When the first discoveries were made,
<HI>Antipater</HI> was at <HI>Rome. Herod</HI> sent for him in a very
pressing but kind manner, dissembling all suspicions
concerning him, that he might not delay to return to
<HI>Judea. Josephus</HI> says, that when <HI>Antipater</HI> returned,
he knew nothing of the accusations which had been
brought against him, though<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. lib. I. c. 31, p. 1034. v. 27.</NOTE> <HI>seven months</HI> had then
passed from the first discoverie of his crimes. In a day
or two after <HI>Antipater</HI>'s return to <HI>Judea Herod</HI> calls a
council, in which<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 32.</NOTE> he himself and <HI>Varus,</HI> Gover∣nour
of <HI>Syria,</HI> presided. <HI>Antipater</HI> is brought before
them, convicted and remanded to prison. But <HI>Herod</HI>
not daring to pronounce sentence on <HI>Antipater</HI> without
<PB N="454" REF="472"/>
leave from <HI>Augustus,</HI> Expresses were sent to <HI>Rome</HI> with
an account of what had passed. After that these
messengers were sent away from <HI>Judea,</HI> a letter was in∣tercepted,
which was written to <HI>Antipater</HI> by <HI>Acme</HI> a
<HI>Jewish</HI> woman at <HI>Rome</HI> in the service of the Empresse
<HI>Livia,</HI> in which letter were fresh proofs of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s
designs. Hereupon <HI>Herod</HI> sent away fresh dispatches
to <HI>Rome.</HI> These return to <HI>Judea,</HI> and bring word,
that <HI>Acme</HI> had been put to death by <HI>Augustus,</HI> and that
the Emperour left it to <HI>Herod</HI> to do with <HI>Antipater</HI> as
he thought fit. Soon after this, <HI>Antipater</HI> was put to
death, and in five days after <HI>Herod</HI> died<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jos. de Bell. I. i. c. 30, -33. Ant. l. xvii. c. 3,—8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As there was a second ambassy sent to <HI>Rome</HI> after the
trial of <HI>Antipater,</HI> and this returned before <HI>Herod</HI> died,
with an account that <HI>Acme</HI> had been put to death, upon
informations they had carried with them to <HI>Rome;</HI> it is
impossible to assign less than three months for the inter∣val
between the arrival of <HI>Antipater</HI> in <HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI>'s
death, which added to the former <HI>seven</HI> make <HI>ten</HI> months.</P>
<P>IT being supposed in the <HI>first</HI> chapter, that the exe∣cution,
which <HI>Herod</HI> made in his own family, happened
at the same time with the slaughter of the children at
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> it must next be considered, how long time
that execution preceded the first enquiries into <HI>Anti∣pater</HI>'s
designs. The facts mentioned by <HI>Josephus</HI> in
this interval stand thus.</P>
<P>HEROD having put to death several of his cour∣tiers
and servants, calls his friends together, charges
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife with creating disturbances, and insists
upon it that <HI>Pheroras</HI> put her away. <HI>Pheroras</HI> loving
his wife too well to comply with this demand, the two
brothers fall out. <HI>Pheroras</HI> leaves <HI>Herod</HI> and goes to
his Tetrarchy, withal swearing solemnly never to come
to <HI>Herod</HI> more. About this time, as it seems, <HI>Antipa∣ter</HI>
with his father's consent left <HI>Judea</HI> and went to <HI>Rome.</HI>
Soon after <HI>Pheroras</HI> was gone home, <HI>Herod</HI> fell sick.
But though Herod sent for <HI>Pheroras,</HI> he would not come
to him. Not long after, <HI>Pheroras</HI> is sick; <HI>Herod</HI> goes
<PB N="455" REF="473"/>
to see him, they are reconciled, <HI>Pheroras</HI> dies. <HI>Herod</HI>
has him brought to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and buried there<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de Bell. lib. i. cap. 29. §. 4. Ant. xvii. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Pheroras</HI> was buried, some of his servants
made applications to <HI>Herod,</HI> desiring him to enquire
into the manner and causes of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death. These
enquiries open a horrid scene of wickednesse. And it
appears, that a conspiracy had been formed by <HI>Anti∣pater</HI>
to poison his father <HI>Herod;</HI> and that he had com∣mitted
the execution of this design to <HI>Pheroras,</HI> and
servants of his own, whom he had left behind him when
he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and who were to obey <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s di∣rections<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De Bell. ibid. cap. 30. Ant. ibid. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT will not be easie to allot less than three months
for the facts just now mentioned in the interval between
the execution in <HI>Herod</HI>'s family and the first enquiries
into the cause of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death. Three months ad∣ded
to the former <HI>ten</HI> make <HI>thirteen.</HI></P>
<P>THE execution spoken of by <HI>Josephus</HI> and the slaugh∣ter
of the children mentioned by St. <HI>Matthew</HI> being al∣lowed
to have happened both at the same time, the
interval between the birth of Jesus and this exe∣cution
is already computed. It cannot be less than
a year and nine or ten months, that is near two years;
conseqnently, we have a fresh argument that Jesus was
born <HI>three</HI> years before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> But how
inconsistent this is with Jesus being <HI>about thirty years of
age</HI> in the <HI>fifteenth</HI> year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> appears from what
has been said already.</P>
<P>HAVING now stated these objections, and given
them their full force, as I imagine; before I proceed
to offer a reply, I would make two or three reflexions
upon some particulars contained in them.</P>
<P>I Do allow that it appears to me highly probable,
that <HI>Herod</HI> did live a year at left after the slaughter of
the infants.</P>
<P>BUT as for <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s testimony, that the tax in
<HI>Judea</HI> was made by <HI>Saturninus,</HI> I think it is not of
<PB N="456" REF="474"/>
much weight; since he is the only person that has said
this, and he fiourished not till about two hundred years
after the event. Besides, though <HI>Tertullian</HI> was well
skilled in the Roman Laws and Customs, he has com∣mitted
many gross blunders in history. The reader
may see several of them collected by<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dissert. iii. §. 13.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI>
in his Dissertations upon <HI>Ireneaus.</HI> One of them is the
computation <HI>Tertullian</HI> has made of the time from the
nativity of Jesus to the taking of <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Tertul. advers. Jud. cap. 8.</NOTE> by
<HI>Vespasian;</HI> which, according to him, was not full fifty
three years. And in reckoning up the several reigns of
the several Emperours he has quite omitted that of
<HI>Claudius,</HI> and allotted not quite ten years to the reign
of <HI>Nero.</HI> He, who could make such mistakes in the
history of the Roman Emperours, might very easily be
ignorant who was President of <HI>Syria</HI> at the time of our
Saviour's Nativity.</P>

<HI>two years old</HI> and under. But let <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifie two
years, yet I think no conclusion can be made about
the precise time of the birth of Jesus from <HI>Herod</HI>'s or∣ders.
It is most likely, that this star appeared some
time before the birth of Jesus, and that it was under∣stood
by the Wise Men to presignifie it. Hereby they
were prepared for their journey, and it is highly
probable that these Wise Men came into <HI>Judea</HI> to
worship this King, as soon as they could after
they concluded he was born, and that they arrived at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> in a very few Months after his birth. But
since their enquiry was: <HI>Where is he that</HI> IS BORN <HI>King
of the Jews? Herod,</HI> whose cruelty had in a manner no
bounds, orders all children near <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to be slain
who had been born since the appearing of the Star, or
<PB N="457" REF="475"/>
perhaps even for some space<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Neque vero sequitur, si Herodes, omni modo cavens ne puer elaberetur, latiùs saevitiam extendit, non minus in aetate quam loci ratione, ideo stellam quoque tanto ante apparuisse. Grot. ad Mat. ii. I.</NOTE> before the time, at
which, after an exact enquiry of the wise men, he per∣ceived
it had appeared.</P>
<P>As there appears not any proof from St. <HI>Matthew,</HI>
that Jesus was born two years, or near two years be∣fore
the slaughter of the infants; so, I think also, that
there are no proofs in <HI>Josephus</HI> that the Oath taken by
the <HI>Jews</HI> had preceded two years, or near two years,
the execution made in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court. The Oath and
the Execution are related by <HI>Josephus</HI> both together.
The reader is referred to that passage, as also to the
charge brought against <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife immediately af∣ter
that execution was over. Among other things in
that charge <HI>Herod</HI> says,—That she did all she could,
to create a difference between him and his brother; that
the fine imposed upon the <HI>Pharisees</HI> had been evaded by her
means; and that in the present affair nothing had been done
without her. <HI>This present affair</HI> I suppose to relate to
the <HI>predictions given out by the</HI> Pharisees, <HI>that God would
take away the kingdome from</HI> Herod <HI>and his children.</HI> The
payment of the fine is the last crime she is charged with
before this affair, which had preceded the execution.
It certainly therefore is not a crime of two years stand∣ing.
<HI>Herod</HI> in so long a time might have found out some
new fault in a woman, he was so much offended with.
We may be pretty well assured from this account, if I
mistake not, that this Oath had preceded the said execu∣tion
and predictions but some few months only.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING then the Execution to be truly dated,
in the objection, at about thirteen months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> we may infer, that the <HI>Oath</HI> in <HI>Jose∣phus,</HI>
and the <HI>Description</HI> in St. <HI>Luke</HI> was made, and that
Jesus was born about a year and fix or seven months
before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>IF indeed <HI>Antipater</HI> had been at <HI>Rome</HI> two years be∣fore
he was recalled by his father, as some learned men
<PB N="458" REF="476"/>
have thought, then this execution must have been made
above thirteen months before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death; because it
is likely, or rather certain, that <HI>Antipater</HI> was in <HI>Judea</HI>
at the time of that execution. But I think it is a mis∣take,
to suppose he had been so long out of <HI>Judea. An∣tipater</HI>
stayed some time in <HI>Judea,</HI> after his brothers
<HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus</HI> were<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Antiq. xvii. cap. I.</NOTE> dead; and took a
great deal of pains to defeat and set aside the advanta∣geous
marriages which <HI>Herod</HI> designed for their chil∣dren:
He also entered into cabals with <HI>Pheroras</HI> and
his wife in order to secure the succession for himself,
Moreover, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was got to <HI>Rome</HI> a good while
before <HI>Antipater</HI> went from home. <HI>Josephus</HI> says in his
<HI>Antiquities,</HI> that <HI>Antipater</HI> having resolved, if possible,
to hasten his father's death, and being desirous to
strengthen and secure his own interest, that he might
reign after him; “He remitted large sums of money
to his father's friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might gain
their good will, but especially that he might have
the favour of <HI>Saturninus</HI> the governour of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. p. 750. v. 10.</NOTE>”
<HI>Saturninus</HI> is not here called governour of <HI>Syria,</HI> because
he was then actually in that Post, for he is manifestly at
<HI>Rome;</HI> but to distinguish him from others of that
name, of which there were many. And it appears
from the parallel place in the <HI>War of the Jews,</HI> that one
favour which <HI>Antipater</HI> desired of these persons at <HI>Rome,</HI>
who had influence on his father, was, that they would
write to <HI>Herod</HI> that his [<HI>Antipater</HI>'s] presence at <HI>Rome</HI>
would be serviceable to him in the present posture of
affairs. <HI>Antipater</HI> had now settled all things with <HI>Phe∣roras</HI>
for the poysoning of <HI>Herod,</HI> as soon as an oppor∣tunity
offered. But <HI>Antipater,</HI> so long as he staid in
<HI>Judea,</HI> could not forbear conversing with <HI>Pheroras</HI> and
his wife, which was extremely disagreeable to <HI>Herod,</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="477"/>
“Therefore <HI>Antipater</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>de B. l. I. c. 29. §. 2.</NOTE> contrived by the interest of
friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> to procure leave for a voyage thi∣ther.
These writing, that it would be very proper
for <HI>Antipater</HI> to be sent to <HI>Cesar</HI> without delay; he
[<HI>Herod</HI>] immediately sent him thither, having fur∣nished
him with a sumptuous equipage and large
sums of money, giving him also his Will to carry
with him to the Emperour.”</P>
<P>IT is true, that after <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey to <HI>Rome,</HI>
mention is made of <HI>Saturninus</HI> as in <HI>Syria:</HI> But then it
is, because <HI>Josephus</HI> relates a fact, that had happened
before <HI>Antipater</HI> went from <HI>Judea. Josephus,</HI> giving
an account of what <HI>Antipater</HI> did at <HI>Rome,</HI> mentions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">De B. ibid. §. 3. Ant. 17. c. 3. §. 2.</NOTE>
some accomplices of <HI>Syllaeus</HI> sent thither by <HI>Saturninus</HI>
to answer for themselves. But this might have been
done by <HI>Saturninus</HI> some time before.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if <HI>Antipater</HI> had been two years out of <HI>Ju∣dea,
Herod,</HI> who wanted plausible reasons to induce
him to return, could not have failed to have put this,
of his long absence, into his letters, as a very cogent
and unexceptionable argument, which yet he does not
appear<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See the substance of these letters, De B. l. I. c. 31. §. 3. Ant. 17. c. 5. §. I.</NOTE> to have
done.</P>
<P>IT maybe farther argued, that <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey
to <HI>Rome</HI> did not precede the death of <HI>Herod</HI> two years.
The very commencement of the enquiries into the death
of <HI>Pheroras</HI> could not be above ten months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> as has been shewn already. A great
progresse had been made in those examinations; <HI>Doris,
Antipater</HI>'s mother, had been detected and put out
of<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ant. 17. c. 4. §. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Herod</HI>'s house; <HI>Mariamne</HI> the High Priest's
daughter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> was also put away, and her son struck
out of a new Will <HI>Herod</HI> had made. “When these
<PB N="460" REF="478"/>
things were doing, says <HI>Josephus, Bathyllus Antipater</HI>'s
freedman arrived from <HI>Rome.</HI> And being put to the
question was discovered to have brought with him a
fresh quantity of poyson to be given to his [<HI>Antipa∣ter</HI>'s]
mother and <HI>Pheroras,</HI> that if the former had
failed to dispatch the King, they might try this<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. §. 3. de B. I. c. 31. §. I.</NOTE>
upon him.” Before <HI>Antipater</HI> had gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> he
had provided<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Antiq. ib. §. 3. De Bell. ibid. c. 30. §. 5.</NOTE> poyson for <HI>Pheroras</HI> to give his fa∣ther.
It is plain, that when <HI>Bathyllus</HI> was sent from
<HI>Rome, Antipater</HI> did not know whether <HI>Pheroras</HI> had
made any use of the first poyson or not, and that he had
still a full confidence in him. But if <HI>Antipater</HI> had been
gone from <HI>Judea</HI> two years, and had heard nothing of
the effect of that poyson, such a delay would have crea∣ted
suspicions. Moreover this second preparation ap∣pears
to be sent to back the former; so that we may
be assured, we are to go backward, not years, but on∣ly
some months for the true time of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s leaving
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>ONCE more, the first opening of the enquiries into
the causes of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death has been laid at about ten
months before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> That <HI>Antipater</HI> was
then but newly set out for <HI>Rome,</HI> may be inferred from
hence. <HI>Pheroras</HI> being dead, <HI>Herod</HI> had him brought
to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> honoured him with a funeral, and made
great lamentations for him. “This, says <HI>Josephus,</HI> was
the beginning of sorrow to <HI>Antipater,</HI> though<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 17. c. 3. §. 3.</NOTE> he
was then failed to <HI>Rome;</HI> God requiring of him the
blood of his brothers. I shall give a particular rela∣tion
of this whole affair, that it may be an admoni∣tion
to all mankind to adhere to the practise of vir∣tue.”
If <HI>Antipater</HI> had been then any long time out
<PB N="461" REF="479"/>
of <HI>Judea, Josephus</HI> would have said, though he was
then at <HI>Rome,</HI> or though he <HI>had been some time there.</HI>
It is possible, <HI>Antipater</HI> might have been gone from
home a month or two; but the phrase here used by <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
seems to me to import, that there were not yet
come to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> any tidings of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s arrival at
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I HOPE it will be excused, that I have insisted so long
upon this point. The supposition, that <HI>Antipater</HI> was
gone to <HI>Rome</HI> before the removal of <HI>Saturninus,</HI> and
two years or more before the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> has caused
much confusion in the chronology of many learned men
about this time.</P>
<P>THERE is in <HI>Josephus</HI> another passage, not yet ob∣served
by any one upon this occasion, that I know of,
which may help to determine the time of the execution
made by <HI>Herod</HI> in his court and at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and which
will confirm my opinion about it. <HI>Josephus,</HI> having
given the history of <HI>Herod</HI>'s putting to death his two
sons <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> makes divers reflections
upon that action. “It might have been sufficient, <HI>says
he,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 16. c. ult. ad fin.</NOTE> even supposing them guilty of the crimes laid to
their charge, to have condemned them to perpetual
imprisonment, or to have banished them, but to take
away their lives was a piece of downright cruelty.
Nor does the delay extenuate the crime; for after de∣liberation,
having been resolved at one time and in
suspense at another, to commit such a fact, is an argu∣ment
of a cruel disposition, and of a mind obstinately
bent upon wickednesse: Which same temper he shew∣ed
afterwards upon another occasion, when he spared
not others, [or <HI>the rest</HI>] persons who seemed to be the
most dear to him of any. The justice of their punish∣ment
<PB N="462" REF="480"/>
abates our compassion for their ruine, but yet
his crueltie was alike here also, in that he spared not
even them. But of these more in course by and by.”</P>
<P>THIS last piece of cruelty I take to mean the exe∣cution
made by <HI>Herod</HI> in his court, and which <HI>Josephus</HI>
relates afterwards in the next book of these <HI>Antiquities,</HI>
It cannot refer to the death of <HI>Antipater,</HI> because he is
but one; nor to the design upon the <HI>chief men of Judea</HI>
shut up in the <HI>Circus,</HI> because they had committed no
offense, and that design was never executed; nor to the
<HI>Rabbies,</HI> because they do not appear to have ever been
dear to <HI>Herod.</HI> But it must be the before mention∣ed
<HI>execution,</HI> of which I hope the reader has a clear idea.
Then <HI>Herod</HI> put to death all of his own family, that
adhered to the things said by the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and other
persons who appear to have been favourites with him.
And it is observable, that as in that account <HI>Josephus</HI>
is pleased to divert himself with those executions; so,
here also, even when he is aggravating the cruelty
of <HI>Herod,</HI> he betrays the same good will toward those
who then suffered under the rage of this inhumane
tyrant.</P>
<P>IT would be desirable here to settle exactly the time
when these two sons of <HI>Herod</HI> were put to death. Dr.
<HI>Allix</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Conventum Berytensem qui habitus est in causa Alexandri &amp; Aristobuli Maio mense A. U. 749. ibid. p. 18. vid. &amp; p. 13. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> places the council of <HI>Berytum,</HI> before which
they were tryed, and by which they were condemned,
in the month of <HI>May,</HI> A. U. 749, about ten months
before <HI>Herod</HI> died. But if <HI>Herod</HI> died in the Spring,
A. U. 750, as the Doctor supposes, this council is cer∣tainly
placed by him too late. It is evident from parti∣culars
insisted on in the objection, and since allowed or
mentioned by me, that it must have preceded the death
of <HI>Herod</HI> above ten months. Moreover, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was
one of this council, and if the first Medal and the epo∣cha
above mentioned be allowed, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was gone
from <HI>Syria</HI> before <HI>Sept.</HI> 748. It may be however sup∣posed,
I think, that this Council was not held long be∣fore
<PB N="463" REF="481"/>
the removal of <HI>Saturninus:</HI> And it is certain from
the passage just transcribed, that the execution of the
<HI>Pharisees</HI> and others <HI>Jerusalem</HI> happened some conside∣rable
time after the death of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus.</HI></P>
<P>IF any should object, that according to the account
I have given of the <HI>Oath</HI> or Enrolment, that it was ow∣ing
to the displeasure of <HI>Augustus</HI> against <HI>Herod,</HI> it can∣not
be placed so near the end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign as I here
suppose, but must have happened a considerable
time before the removal of <HI>Saturninus;</HI> because <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
appears to have been reconciled to <HI>Herod</HI> before
<HI>Saturninus</HI> left the province, and before the council at
<HI>Berytum,</HI> in which <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus</HI> were con∣demned:
I answer, that the enrolment is not placed by
me too late at all. It might be resolved upon by <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
before, and yet not be executed till after <HI>Satur∣ninus</HI>
went away. And though <HI>Augustus</HI> might be in
some measure pacified, yet he might think fit to have
the assssement made. Besides, though <HI>Josephus</HI> says,
that upon the applications <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI> had
made to <HI>Augustus</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> the Emperour was recon∣ciled
to <HI>Herod,</HI> that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> was ordered home, requir∣ed
to pay the money he owed, and give all proper sa∣tisfaction,
and was afterwards<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 16. c. 10. §. 9.</NOTE> to be punished: Yet
it is certain, that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> did not give <HI>Herod</HI> or any one
else satisfaction. And it may be from thence infer∣red,
that <HI>Herod</HI> was not fully reinstated in <HI>Augustus</HI>'s
favour, for then <HI>Syllaeus</HI> would have been more sub∣missive.
<HI>Josephus</HI> relating <HI>Antipater</HI>'s voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI>
of which we have made frequent mention, says: “<HI>Syl∣laeus</HI>
the <HI>Arabian</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ib. l. 17. c. 3. §. 2.</NOTE> also went thither at the same
time, not having performed any of those things which
<HI>Cesar</HI> enjoyned. And <HI>Antipater</HI> accused him to <HI>Cesar</HI>
<PB N="464" REF="482"/>
upon the same heads he had been before accused of by
<HI>Nicolas.</HI>” From what has been said concerning the
time of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey it appears, that this accusa∣tion
must have been brought against <HI>Syllaeus</HI> in the last
year of <HI>Herod</HI>'s life.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s affairs were not in a good
posture at this time at <HI>Rome.</HI> If they had, <HI>Antipater</HI>
could not have made the state of them, and the service
he might do his father there, a pretense for his journey.
Moreover, <HI>Antipater</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De B. 1. c. 31. §. 2.</NOTE> charged <HI>Herod</HI> with a sum of
two hundred talents, laid out chiefly, as he pretended,
in the cause against <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> his father's great enemy.
From all which it is reasonable to conclude, that <HI>Nico∣las</HI>
had, in his history, out of regard to his master and
himself, magnified the successe of his negociations at
<HI>Rome.</HI> Nor can it be justly expected from an Historian,
that when he comes down to the affairs of his own time,
he should be perfectly indifferent toward those in which
he acted a part himself.</P>
<P>HAVING now cleared the way, I would lay down
two or three conclusions.</P>
<P>1. I APPREHEND it appears from what has been
here offered, that there is no necessity of placing the
birth of Jesus above a year and six months before the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI> If <HI>Herod</HI> died in <HI>March,</HI> A. U. 750,
I should be inclined to place the nativity of Jesus in
<HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> A. U. 748. If <HI>Herod</HI> died in <HI>March</HI>
751, then the nativity of Jesus might very well be
placed in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> 749. As I am not able
fully to determine the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s death; I shall for
the future have some regard to both these dates of our
Saviour's Nativity.</P>
<P>2. THE acount that has been given above of the
time of <HI>Saturninus</HI>'s removal, and <HI>Varus</HI>'s arrival in the
province of <HI>Syria</HI> does also incline us to one of these
dates. It is not improbable, that the oath was taken,
or the assessment made much about the same time that
<PB N="465" REF="483"/>
<HI>Varus</HI> came into <HI>Syria.</HI> And it is supposed by many
learned men, that the Roman Governours usually came
from <HI>Rome</HI> into these Eastern provinces at the latter
end of the summer. It is certain, that upon the re∣moval
of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> came Governour
into <HI>Syria,</HI> there was an assessment made in <HI>Syria</HI> and
<HI>Judea.</HI> I am the rather inclined to think this the time
of the Oath, because <HI>Josephus</HI> in his history does not re∣late
when it was taken, but mentions it only Upon oc∣casion
of a disturbance at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> which had a con∣nexion
with it. And it is observable, that he has said
nothing of <HI>Varus,</HI> nor of the concerns of <HI>Syria,</HI> till we
hear of <HI>Varus</HI> being at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> when <HI>Antipater</HI> return∣ed
home. But, if those Medals are to be relied on,
<HI>Varus</HI> had now been a good while in <HI>Syria.</HI> There is
therefore in <HI>Josephus</HI> a long gap in the concerns of <HI>Syria,</HI>
and also in the publick concerns of <HI>Judea</HI> from the
conncil at <HI>Berytum</HI> to the execution at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Du∣ring
this time of <HI>Josephus</HI>'s silence, I suppose the assesse∣ment
was made. According to the first of the <HI>Antio∣chian</HI>
Medals, <HI>Varus</HI> came into <HI>Syria</HI> before <HI>Sept.</HI> 748.
If this be supposed the most likely date of his govern∣ment,
and if it be also most probable that <HI>Herod</HI> died
A. U. 750, these may strongly dispose us to place the
nativity of Jesus in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> 748.</P>
<P>3. THE latter part of the summer, or the autumn
season seems to be the most likely time of the year
for the birth of <HI>Jesus.</HI> There is no particular reason to
determine us to the 25th of <HI>December.</HI> The very depth
of winter is not a very proper season for a survey and
assessment, when people are to enter themselves ac∣cording
to their tribes or families. The autumn, when
harvest and vintage are over, is a time of general lei∣sure.
When Jesus was born at <HI>Bethlehem, There were
in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
watch over their flocks by night,</HI> Luke ii. 8. In some
very mild climates sheep may be abroad in the night
time in <HI>December.</HI> But it is not very likely, they
shouid be so in those countries, where they must be
<PB N="466" REF="484"/>
attended with shepherds. This circumstance is not very
favourable to the supposition, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was born the
25th <HI>Dec.</HI> and we are at liberty to place it in autumn,
a more likely season.</P>
<P>IT is not improbable then, that <HI>Jesus</HI> might be born
some time between the middle of <HI>August</HI> and the middle
of <HI>November. Cyrenius,</HI> we may suppose, came into
<HI>Judea</HI> at the time, or soon after the time that <HI>Varus</HI>
came Governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> and published the decree
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> requiring all people to enter themselves,
their dependents, and estates. <HI>Judea</HI> was a country of
a narrow compare, and the assessement might very well
be made in two or three months. <HI>Cyrenius</HI> coming into
the country, and being a man of dispatch in all his un∣dertakings;
being desirous also to hasten to <HI>Rome</HI> to re∣ceive
the honours decreed him for the victory over the
<HI>Homonadenses;</HI> being also concerned to set sail before the
bad weather came on, he appointed all people to en∣role
themselves with all expedition within a certain li∣mited
time, which they did accordingly. <HI>And all went
to be taxed every one in his own city,</HI> ver. 3. The short
time appointed for this work may be fairly concluded
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s history of it. If the space of time al∣lotted
for it had been of any considerable length, it can∣not
be thought but that <HI>Joseph</HI> would have taken an
opportunity to go to <HI>Bethlehem</HI> some while before the
time of the Virgin's delivery, or else have deferred the
journey till that was over. There is not the left hint,
that this journey was taken just at this season in obe∣dience
to a divine admonition. It is given us as the
pure result of obedience to this decree of <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>WE will now lay together a few events of this time,
in the order in which it may be supposed they happened.</P>
<P>ABOUT a year and six or seven months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> soon after the arrival of <HI>Varus</HI> in the
province of <HI>Syria,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> A. U. 748,
or 749, <HI>Julian</HI> year 40, or 41, <HI>Cyrenius</HI> [or some other
person of eminence] came into <HI>Judea,</HI> an assessement
was made there, and in the time of it, Jesus was born
<PB N="467" REF="485"/>
at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> in the month of <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October.</HI> After
the term of forty days was expired Jesus was presented
in the temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> made her offer∣ing
according to the Law. When these things were
finished, they went from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and dwelt in some
City of <HI>Judea,</HI> possibly at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> In the year fol∣lowing,
<HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 749, or 750, about the beginning
of <HI>February, came wise men from the east to</HI> Jerusalem,
<HI>saying, Where is he that is born king of the</HI> Jews? They
being guided by the star which they <HI>had seen in the east,
went and worshipped him.</HI> After their departure, the
Virgin and the child Jesus being now fit for travelling,
<HI>Joseph</HI> was admonished by <HI>an angel, to take the young
child and his mother and flee into</HI> Egypt, which he did.
<HI>Herod</HI> soon perceiving from the wise men's not return∣ing
to him, that he had been <HI>mocked</HI> by them, and be∣ing
much enraged thereat, <HI>sent forth and slew all the chil∣dren
that were in</HI> Bethlehem, <HI>and in all the coasts thereof,
from two years old and under, according to the time which
he bad diligently enquired of the wise men.</HI> He also put to
death at the same time divers <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and other per∣sons
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> some of his own family and attendants;
who, being before in expectation of the coming of a
great Prince who was to rise up from among them, and
by the arrival of the wise men had been confirmed in the
belief that this event was now at hand, expressed them∣selves
in terms, which <HI>Herod</HI> and his son <HI>Antipater</HI> and
their flatterers termed seditious. Immediately after these
executions <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife was called to an account also,
as being supposed to have entertained the same princi∣ples
with these <HI>Pharisees,</HI> to whom she had lately shewn
great favour in paying the fine imposed upon them for
not entering themselves and taking the appointed Oath
in the time, of the forementioned assessement. <HI>Pherora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
not submitting to the orders given him by <HI>Herod</HI> in coun∣cil

began; and though <HI>Antipater</HI> was failed from <HI>Judea</HI> for

ought to be executed on him; and therefore, ac∣cording

been supposed he was in safety: yet from this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
Divine vengeance began to prepare itself against him,
till at last it fell upon him for all his horrid crimes. The
evidence was at first obscure and imperfect, but opened
continually more and more. <HI>Herod</HI> in his letters to <HI>An∣tipater</HI>
dissembled his resentments, but earnestly pressed
his return to <HI>Judea.</HI> About the middle of <HI>December,</HI>
seven months after the first enquiry into the cause of
of <HI>Pherras</HI>'s death, <HI>Antipater</HI> arrived at <HI>Jerusalem:</HI>
And is tried before <HI>Herod,</HI> and <HI>Varus</HI> president of <HI>Syria,</HI>
and condemned to death. <HI>Herod</HI> however, not daring
to proceed to execute the sentence without express leave
from <HI>Augustus,</HI> sent ambassadors to <HI>Rome</HI> with a full
account of what had passed; and soon after, a second
ambassy, new evidence having been found after the de∣parture
of the former. These last ambassadours return
<PB N="469" REF="487"/>
to <HI>Judea</HI> with full power from <HI>Augustus</HI> about the mid∣dle
of March, A. U. 750, or 751: soon after which <HI>An∣tipater</HI>
was executed, and in five days after <HI>Herod</HI> him∣self
died, about a year and five or six months after the
birth of Jesus.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I presume it appears, we lie under
no necessity of dating the birth of Jesus before the latter
end of the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 748, or 749. We hereby
in part abate the objection, as stated above; but still we
have before us undoubtedly a very great difficulty. We
will now enquire what can be said to it.</P>
<P>§. II. 1. WHEN St <HI>Luke</HI> says, <HI>Now in the fifteenth
year of the reign of</HI> Tiberius,—<HI>the word of God came
unto</HI> John, he may intend some computation of the
reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> different from that of his sole empire
after the death of <HI>Augustus.</HI> It is no unusual thing for
the reigns of princes to be computed from several dates.
There were two computations of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s
reign. For, as Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> observes, “<HI>Nabopollasar</HI>
King of <HI>Babylon</HI> being old and infirm took his son
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> into partnership in the Empire, and
sent him with an army into those parts [<HI>Syria</HI> and
<HI>Palestine</HI>]. And from hence the <HI>jewish</HI> computation
of the years of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s reign begins.—But
according to the <HI>Babylonians</HI> his reign is not reckoned
to begin till after his father's death, which happened
two years afterwards. And both computations being
found in scripture, it is necessary to say so much here
for the reconciling of them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Conn. Part. 1. p. 60.</NOTE>.” And there were two
or three ways of computing the reign of<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Marshall</HI>'s Treatise of the 70 weeks, p. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to come nearer to our time; there were many
computations of the reign of<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Vid. Petav. Rationarium Temp. Par. 2. l. 3. c. 15. Pagi Appar. n. 66.—73, 103, 114.</NOTE> <HI>Augustus.</HI> Some com∣puted
the beginning of his reign from the year in which
<HI>Julius Cesar</HI> was killed, as<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 18. c. 2. §. 2. De Bell. 2. c. 9. §. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus;</HI> who says: <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
reigned fifty seven years six months and odd days.
<PB N="470" REF="488"/>
Some from the year after, and reckoned his reign fifty
six years. Others computed from the year in which
the victory was obtained at<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Atque ab eo tempore exercitibus comparatis, primum cum M.

he reigned forty four years; others from the year

of <HI>Judea</HI> by the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Joseph. de B. 1. c. ult. §. 8. 1. Antiq. 17. c. 8. §. 1.</NOTE> Roman senate.</P>
<P>2. THERE seems to be very good reason to conclude
from divers passages of the Roman historians and the
most ancient Christian writers, that there were two dif∣ferent
computations of the beginning of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign;
one from the time he was made Collegue with <HI>Augustus,</HI>
and the other from his sole empire after the death of
<HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>SEVERAL very learned men and very eminent chro∣nologers

Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. Chr, 11. 71. 117. 147.</NOTE> are of opinion, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> intends the
former of these two computations. I shall give a brief
account of the grounds there are for this supposition,
taken chiefly from Dr. <HI>Pagi;</HI> who appears to have be∣stowed
a great deal of pains upon this argument, and
must be allowed to have treated it with great accuracy
and judgment.</P>
<P>(1.) THAT <HI>Augustus</HI> did in part lay aside govern∣ment
some time before he died, may be inferred from
the words of an uncertain author of a Panegyrick, in
which, in the name of the City of <HI>Rome</HI> he disswades
<HI>Maximianus Herculeus</HI> from resigning the Empire. “Is
it fit, <HI>says he,</HI> that you should now give your self a
discharge, and do that so soon, which <HI>Augustus</HI> did
<PB N="471" REF="489"/>
not do till after the seventieth year of his age, and the
fiftieth of<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Quo usque hoc Maximiane, patiar, me quati, te quiescere, mihi libertatem adimi, te usurpare tibi illicitam missionem?

<P>(2.) SEVERAL of the Roman historians have express∣ly
mentioned <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s being taken into partnership in
the Government with <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>VELLEIUS PATERCULUS, who lived in the
reigns of these two Emperours, says, “that at the de∣sire
of <HI>Augustus</HI> there was a law passed by the Senate
and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Tiberius</HI> might have equal
power with him in all the provinces and<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cum res Galliarum maximae molis, accen∣sasque plebis Viennensium dissensiones, coercitione magis quam poenâ mollisset, &amp; Senatus Populufque Rom.

<HI>Suetonius</HI> says, “There was a law made, that <HI>Tiberius</HI>
should govern the provinces jointly with <HI>Augustus,</HI>
and make the census with<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">A Germania in urbem post biennium regressus, triumphum quem distulerat egit.—Dedicavit &amp; Concordiae aedem: item Pollucis &amp; Castoris, suo fratrisque nomine, de manubiis.

That <HI>Tiberius</HI> was made collegue in the Empire (with

power, and recommended<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Drusoque pridem extincto, Nero solus è privignis erat: illic cuncta vergere: filius, collega imperii, consors tribunitiac potestatis adsumitur, omnisque per exercitus ostentatur. Tacit. An. lib. 1. c. 3.</NOTE> to all the armies.”
And there are in this last mentioned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Etenim Augustus, paucis ante annis, cum Tiberio Tribuniciam potestatem A PATRIBUS RURSUM postularet, &amp;c. id. ibid. c. 10.

references to <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s partnership in the empire
with <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST be allowed to be particular in the account
of some things laid by <HI>Dio.</HI> In his history of the affairs,
A. U. 765, A. D. 12, he says: “<HI>Augustus</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dio. l. 56 p. 587. B. C.</NOTE> now ad∣vanced
in years, recommended in a writing <HI>Germani∣cus</HI>
to the Senate, and the Senate to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> He
did not however read the writing himself (not being
able) but <HI>Germanicus,</HI> as he had been wont to do.—But
yet he did not lay aside the care of the public.—”
Under the next Year, A. U. 766. A. D. 13. the same
historian says: “<HI>Augustus</HI> then accepted<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid. p. 588. B.</NOTE> for the
fifth time, though unwillingly, the government of
the state for ten years, and renew'd also the Tribu∣nician
power to <HI>Tiberius.</HI>” He says also, “That <HI>Au∣gustus</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ib. C. D.</NOTE> on account of his great age (which likewise
hindered his coming to the Senate, except very rare∣ly)
desired he might have twenty annual counsellors,—
And a decree was passed, that whatever was enacted
in council by him, together with <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and those
said counsellors, and the Consuls in being, and the
Consuls elect, and his Grandsons adopted by him, and
any others whom he should call to his council, should
be ratified, and deemed of the same authority, as if
enacted by the authority of the whole senate.” This
mention of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and of him only by name, in this
decree of the senate, next after <HI>Augustus,</HI> appears to me
remarkable. I do not observe that any of these passages
<PB N="473" REF="491"/>
of <HI>Dio</HI> have been quoted by <HI>Pagi.</HI> For what reason he
omitted them, I do not know. He has however insist∣ed
upon another passage of this historian taken fromm
the preceding year, <HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 764 A. D. 11. But
his argument from it seems to me to be founded upon
a forced and arbitrary construction of <HI>Dio:</HI> and there∣fore
I content my self with referring the reader for it
to<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">A. D. 11. n. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE> him, and<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Le Clerc,</HI> who also lays a stresse
upon it.</P>
<P>ONCE more, <HI>Dio</HI> says, “that upon the death of
<HI>Augustus, Tiberius</HI> immediately<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. l. 57. p. 602. D.</NOTE> sent away letters
from <HI>Nola</HI> to the armies and all the provinces, as
Emperour: but yet did not call himself so, though
that, with other titles, had been given him by a de∣cree.”</P>
<P>(3.) THERE is a particular fact related of <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>
by several Historians, said to be done by him when
<HI>Prince,</HI> which yet must have been done before <HI>Augustus</HI>
died. <HI>Plinie</HI> says, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was much given to drink∣ing:
“And that it was thought, that for this reason
<HI>Lucius Piso</HI> had been chosen by him to be Prefect of
<HI>Rome,</HI> because he had continued two days and two
nights drinking with him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">—Tribus congiis (unde &amp; cognomen illi fuit epotis uno impetu, spectante miraculi gratia Tib. principe, in Senecta jam severo atque etiam saevo alias, sed ipsa juven∣ta ad merum pronior fuerat: eaque commendatione credidere L.

Suetonius</HI>
says, “That <HI>Tiberius</HI> in his first campains, was much
reflected on for his excesse in drinking; and that, af∣terwards
when <HI>Prince,</HI> in the very time of the Cor∣rection
of the publick manners he spent a night and
two days in cating and drinking with <HI>Pomponius Flac∣cus</HI>
and <HI>Lucius Piso;</HI> to the former of which he gave
<PB N="474" REF="492"/>
immediately the province of <HI>Syria,</HI> and to the other
the prefecture of the City<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In eastris tiro etiam tum, propter vini aviditatem pro Claudio,<HI>Caldius,</HI> pro Nerone <HI>Mero</HI> vocabatur.

Pisone noctem continuumque biduum epulando potandoque consumpsit: quorum al∣teri Syriam provinciam, alteri praefecturam urbis confestim detulit. Suet. in Tib. cap. 42.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT may be worth while to observe with <HI>Pagi,</HI> that
these two writers who tell us the story of this drunken
bout of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and the consequences of it, seem not
to have had their accounts from one and the same source.
They differ from each other in two or three particulars:
One says, that this piece of excesse lasted <HI>two days and
two nights;</HI> the other, <HI>one night and two days. Plinie</HI>
mentions only the preferment of <HI>Piso, Suetonius</HI> adds that
of <HI>Flaccus</HI> also. But they both agree in saying, that
<HI>Tiberius</HI> was <HI>then Prince,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> adds a very par∣ticular
circumstance as to the time, that it was during
the correction of the publick manners, which may very
naturally lead us to what he had said of the Law passed,
that <HI>Tiberius</HI> should govern the provinces jointly with
<HI>Augustus</HI> and make the Census with him; one part of
which at <HI>Rome</HI> was the Correction of manners.</P>
<P>BUT we must enquire somewhat more particularly
into the time of this act of intemperance. It may be
easily inferred from <HI>Tacitus:</HI> who relating the affairs of
the year in which <HI>Domitius Aenobarbus</HI> and <HI>M. Furius
Camillus</HI> were Consuls, sc. A. U. 785, A. D. 32, says:
“Then <HI>Piso</HI> had the honour of a public funeral by de∣cree
of the Senate, having behaved in his office to ge∣neral satisfaction for<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Dein Piso viginti per annos pariter probatus, publico funere ex decreto Senatus celebratus est. Tacit. Ann. l. vi. cap. 11.</NOTE> twenty years.” If we go
back twenty years, we are brought to the 12th year of
the Christian Aera, and the 765th of the City; in which
year, according to <HI>Tacitus, Piso</HI> must have been prefect
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is two years before the death of <HI>Au∣gustus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="493"/>
THERE are however some objections to this story,
which must be considered before we leave it. Seve∣ral
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Lipsius in loc. Noris. Cenot. Pis. Diss. ii. p. 324.</NOTE> learned men would read in <HI>Tacitus</HI> X. instead of
XX. But to this Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI>'s reply is sufficient, that this
emendation is without the authority of any Manuscripts.
It is likewise objected, that <HI>Pomponius Flaccus</HI> was not
Prefect of <HI>Syria</HI> till long after the year of the City 765:
consequently, neither was <HI>Piso</HI> then made Prefect<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sed hoc amplius ex Suetonio colliges, factum Pisonem Praefectum, sub idem tempus quo Pomponius Syriae Praetor. Ille autem Syriae no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ante annum 773 praeponi potuit (Maesiam enim provinciam admini∣strabat, A. 772. uti ex Tacit. lib. ii. clarum:) non ergo tot annos Piso Praefectus urbi.

of <HI>Rome.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">A. Chr. 11. n. v.</NOTE> allows very readily, that <HI>Pom∣ponius</HI>
did not at this time go Prefect into <HI>Syria;</HI> but
then he gives several instances of men who have been
nominated governours of provinces, who yet never went
into them; one is <HI>Aelius Lamia,</HI> who by this very same
Emperour had been nominated prefect of the same pro∣vince
likewise, namely of <HI>Syria,</HI> but yet never went
thither. The fact is taken notice of by<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Extremo anni [A. U. 786. A. D. 33.] Mors Aelii Lamiae funere censorio celebrata, qui administrandae Su∣riae imagine tandem exsolutus, urbi praefuerat. Tacit. Ann. l. 6. c. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Tacitus,</HI>

<P>ANOTHER objection against <HI>Piso</HI>'s being made pre∣fect
of the City, A. U. 765, is this: <HI>Suetonius</HI> says, that
this excesse of <HI>Tiberius</HI> was committed during the public
correction of manners: By which he has been supposed
to refer to <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s being made Censor with <HI>Augustus.</HI>
But Cardinal <HI>Noris</HI> objects, than the Census was not
<PB N="476" REF="494"/>
made by <HI>Augustus,</HI> A. U. 765, but 767. And<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sed Suetonius fi <HI>censorem</HI> Tiberiam significaret, annum U.

opinion, that the <HI>public correction of manners,</HI> which <HI>Sue∣tonius</HI>
here speaks of, intends the Edicts which <HI>Tiberius</HI>
published against Luxury, A. U. 775. For my own
part, I cannot see, but that the words of <HI>Suetonius</HI> may
very well refer to the time in which <HI>Tiberius</HI> was <HI>de∣creed</HI>
Censor with <HI>Augustus,</HI> which might be done, A. U.
765: though the Census was not <HI>made,</HI> or at lest not
finished, till the year 767.</P>
<P>BUT that this <HI>correction of manners,</HI> which <HI>Suetonius</HI>
here speaks of, is not that which he has himself men∣tioned in another<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">In Tib. cap. 34.</NOTE> place; and which <HI>Tacitus</HI> says was

two or three passages, not particularly insisted on by
<HI>Pagi. Seneca</HI> says, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> gave secret directions of
importance to <HI>Piso,</HI> when he went into <HI>Campania,</HI> at
which time there were divers uneasinesses and discontents
in the City<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">L.

of <HI>Rome</HI> in 774, and in the very beginning of it: and
it may be supposed, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had had considerable
experience of <HI>Piso</HI>'S fidelity and ability in that post be∣fore

that, since he relied upon him in a very critical
conjuncture.</P>

<HI>Tiberius</HI> had proconsular power in the provinces two
years before <HI>Augustus</HI>'s death: all the authority, he had
in the city was owing to his Tribunician Power, but
that included only a right of interceding or forbidding,
but could not give the power of appointing a Prefect.</P>
<P>I THINK it is undoubted, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> might call
the Senate by vertue of the Tribunician power<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vid. Usser. Ann. A. M. 4015 &amp; 4017.</NOTE>, and
it is likely do several other things. But there is no
need of contending about this point. Perhaps <HI>Tiberius</HI>
did not nominate and appoint <HI>Piso</HI> Prefect of the City:
He might however recommend him so effectually to
<HI>Augustus,</HI> his Collegue, that he might appoint him.
Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> observes, that <HI>Plinie,</HI> speaking of this matter,
uses the word <HI>choosing,</HI> not appointing<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eâque com∣mendatione credidere L. Pisonem Urbis Romae curae ab eo <HI>delectum.</HI> vid. Pagi. Crit. ad An. Ch. 11. n. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I IMAGINE, that this fact is now cleared up and
vindicated against the several objections which have
been made to it; and that <HI>Piso</HI> was <HI>appointed</HI> or <HI>chosen</HI>
to be Prefect of the City of <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Tiberius, then
Prince,</HI> two years before the death of <HI>Augustus,</HI> namely,
in A. U. 765.</P>
<P>BUT before I quite leave this story, I would streng∣then the argument founded upon it by a remark or
two upon the title of <HI>Prince</HI> given here to <HI>Tiberius</HI> by
<HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Suetonius.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known that <HI>Prince</HI> was the soft title, which
<HI>Augustus</HI> chose rather than that of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa, nomine PRINCIPIS sub imperium accepit. Tacit. Ann. lib. i. cap. 1. Non regno tamen, neque dictatura, sed PRINCIPIS no∣mine constitutam Rempublicam. id. ibid. c. 9.</NOTE> King or Dictator.
<PB N="478" REF="496"/>
This title therefore, when used absolutely, is equiva∣lent
to Emperour: And <HI>Dio</HI> says, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had the
title of Emperour given him by a decree, before <HI>Augu∣stus</HI>
died, as has been observed already. Moreover
this title of Emperour is frequently given by <HI>Roman</HI> and
<HI>Greek</HI> authors to <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Trajan</HI> on account of their
tribunician and proconsular power, which they enjoyed,
the former in the life-time of his father <HI>Vespasian,</HI> the
latter, of <HI>Nerva.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> thinks, this title of Empe∣rour
which was given to these Collegues in the Empire
was founded particularly on the perpetual proconsular
power in all the provinces<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mitus enim, quemadmodum &amp; ante eum Tiberius, ac post eum Trajanus, imperii Collega fuit, ideoque imperatoris titulo exornatus.

it is certain, they are often called Emperours. <HI>Josephus</HI>
in his description of <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s and <HI>Titus</HI>'s triumph at
<HI>Rome</HI> after the <HI>jewish</HI> war, says, That the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. de Bell. lib. vii. cap. 5. p. 1305. v. 2.</NOTE> Emperours

the elder in his dedication of his <HI>Natural History</HI> to <HI>Titus,</HI>
written before the death of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> calls <HI>Titus Empe∣rour</HI>
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jucundiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Imperator—Sciantque omnes quam ex aequo te∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um vivat imperium.

vain therefore to say, that <HI>Titus</HI> was called Emperour in
his father's life-time purely on account of his having
been saluted Emperour by his soldiers in the Camp, or
in the sense in which this word was used under the Com∣monwealth,
since <HI>Philostratus</HI> says he was declared Em∣perour
<PB N="479" REF="497"/>
at <HI>Rome.</HI> Moreover <HI>Capitolinus</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Avus Annius Rufus, item Consul &amp; praefectus urbi adscitus in patricios a PRINCIPIBUS Vespasiano &amp; Tito censoribus. in Marc. An∣tonin. Philos.</NOTE> calls <HI>Vespa∣sian</HI> and
<HI>Titus Princes</HI> without any distinction. All these
passages thus laid together may satisfie us, that <HI>Prince</HI>
and <HI>Emperour</HI> are equivalent in these writers; and that
<HI>Tiberius</HI> had a right to the title of <HI>Prince,</HI> even during
the life-time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> after he was made his Collegue
in the Empire. I shall refer the reader to but one pas∣sage
more, in which <HI>Plinie</HI> the younger assures us, that
<HI>Trajan</HI> was declared Emperour<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Simul filius, simul Caesar, mox IMPERATOR, &amp; consors Tribuniciae potestatis, &amp; omnia pariter &amp; statim factus es, quae proximè parens verus tantum in alterum filium contulit. Plin. Paneg. c. 8.</NOTE> by <HI>Nerva</HI> in his
life-time. And it seems very strongly to support Dr.
<HI>Pagi</HI>'s opinion, that the title of Emperour given to
these Collegues was founded rather on their Proconsular
empire than their Tribunician power.</P>
<P>(4.) THERE are two or three verses of <HI>Dionysius</HI> the
geographer, which Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> esteems a very remarkable
testimony to the Proconsular Empire of <HI>Tiberius</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, v. 78.

appears from the two last of these verses, that in <HI>Dionysi∣us</HI>'s
time <HI>Rome</HI> was governed by more than one Prince.
It has been questioned indeed, when <HI>Dionysius</HI> lived, and
who are those <HI>Princes</HI> he speaks of. Some have thought,
they were the two <HI>Antonines:</HI> others have thought, he
intended <HI>Severus, Caracalla</HI> and <HI>Geta.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cenot. Pis. Diss. 2. p. 193.</NOTE> Cardinal

the Princes here referred to are <HI>Caius</HI> and <HI>Lucius Caesar,
Augustus</HI>'s adopted Sons. Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> seems to me to have
shewn, that the title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cannot belong to them;
and that <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> are the Princes, which
<HI>Dionysius</HI> means: But for the particulars I must refer
the reader to the Doctor himself<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Critica in Baron. A. D. 11. n. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>(5.) THERE were two different computations of
<HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign in the time of St. <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria.</HI>
For having first said, that <HI>Augustus</HI> reigned forty three
years and <HI>Tiberius</HI> twenty-two,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Clem. Strom. l. 1. p. 339. A. Parisis 1629.</NOTE>, he adds: “But some
reckon the reigns of the Roman Emperours thus.—
<HI>Augustus</HI> reigned forty six years four months and one
day. Then <HI>Tiberius,</HI> twenty six years, six months,
nineteen days.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. ib. C.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>HAVING laid before the reader the chief arguments
that have been produced for the Proconsular or joint
Empire of <HI>Tiberius</HI> with <HI>Augustus,</HI> I will consider also
some of the objections there are against this opinion.</P>
<P>1. IT is objected, That <HI>Spartian</HI> says, that <HI>Marcus
Aurelius</HI> and <HI>Lucius Verus</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hi sunt, qui postea duo pariter Augusti, primi rempulicam gu∣bernaverunt. Spartian. in Hadrian. cap. 24. Vid. Eutrop. lib. viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9. &amp; Capitolin. in Marc. c. 7.</NOTE> were the two first <HI>Augu∣sti</HI>
that governed the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> together. But to
this it is answered, that none of the Patrons of this opini∣on
ever said, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had the title of <HI>Augustus,</HI> whilst
<HI>Augustus</HI> lived, but only that he was Collegue with
him in the Empire. These words of <HI>Spartian</HI> are no
more an objection against <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular em∣pire,
than they are against <HI>Titus</HI>'s and <HI>Trajan</HI>'s, who
certainly enjoyed this honour, the one with his father
<HI>Vespasian,</HI> and the other with <HI>Nerva.</HI></P>
<P>NOR indeed did the title of <HI>Augustus</HI> give any new
power. It was only a title of honour<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dio. lib. liii. p. 507.</NOTE>, which sort of
<PB N="481" REF="499"/>
titles were usually taken gradually. <HI>Tiberius</HI> ever re∣fused
that of Father of his country. And would not
permit that of <HI>Augustus</HI> to be given him by any Decree,
though he accepted of it from some persons, and made
use of it himself in letters to<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Dio. lib. 57. p. 607. A.</NOTE> foreign Princes. And
<HI>Dio</HI> takes notice of it as a singularity in <HI>Caligula,</HI> that
in one day he accepted all those titles, which <HI>Augustus</HI>
had received throughout his long reign, and had suf∣fered
to be given him only one by one (some of which
<HI>Tiberius</HI> never would accept of) except only that of fa∣ther
of his country; which he took upon him also in a
short time after<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dio. lib. 59. p. 641. D.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2dly, IT is objected: If <HI>Tiberius</HI> had been made Col∣legue
in the empire with <HI>Augustus,</HI> there could have
been no reason for those fears about the succession of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> which <HI>Livia</HI> shewed upon the death<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Acribus namque custodiis domum, &amp; vias sepserat Livia. Tacit. Ann. lib. 1. cap. 5.</NOTE> of <HI>Au∣gustus.</HI>
Nor would <HI>Tiberius</HI> have hesitated to accept the
empire when offered to him by the Senate. Or indeed,
what occasion could there have been for any new inve∣stiture
at all?</P>
<P>BUT to this, I think it is easy to answer; that it is
no surprising thing, that <HI>Livia</HI> should be under some
pain, when the settlement of her son in the empire was
at stake. Though <HI>Tiberius</HI> had been partner in the em∣pire,
yet certainly the death of <HI>Augustus</HI> made a great
change. <HI>Germanicus</HI> was very popular, and at the head
of a numerous army<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. i. cap. 33 /M; 35. Dio. lib. 37, p. 603.</NOTE> And as for <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s hesi∣tation,
he had been hitherto but partner in the empire,
and some kind of new investiture was needful. It is true,
he carried his dissimulation very far: but <HI>Augustus</HI> him∣self
<PB N="482" REF="500"/>
never renewed a fresh term of government (which
he did several times) but with much difficulty; and not
till he had been overcome by importunity and the con∣sideration
of the necessity of affairs.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this dissimulation of <HI>Tiberius</HI> has afford∣ed
a new proof, that he had been Collegue with <HI>Augu∣stus.</HI>
For, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Dio</HI> intimate very plainly the
fears which <HI>Tiberius</HI> had of <HI>Germanicus;</HI> so <HI>Suetonius</HI> in
particular says, “He pretended a bad state of health,
that <HI>Germanicus</HI> might entertain hopes of a speedy
succession, or at lest<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Simulavit &amp; valitudinem, quo aequiore animo Germanicus cele∣rem successionem vel certè societatem principatus operiretur. Suet. in Tiber. Cap. 25.</NOTE> a partnership in the empire.”
But such an expectation had been ridiculous in <HI>Germa∣nicus,</HI>
and this pretense of <HI>Tiberius</HI> could never have had
the effect he designed, if no one had been partner in the
empire before.</P>
<P>3. BUT the chief objection against the supposition,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has computed the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> from
the time of his Proconsular empire seems to be this;
That it does not appear that any writers have computed
the reign of those who were Collegues in the empire by
the epocha of their Proconsular empire, and that in
particular there are no traces of this computation of
<HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Est autem inauditum in omni memoria, <HI>Titi</HI> annos abalio initio fuisse deductos quam a morte Vespasiani. S. Basnage Annal. Pol. Eccles. A. D. 11. n. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this I answer: There is reason to think, that
people did often compute according to the epocha of
the Proconsular empire. <HI>Pagi</HI> mentions a Medal, which
has this inscription: <HI>In the</HI> xi. <HI>new sacred year of the
Emperour Titus Cesar Vespasian</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sic in nummo Graeco apud Occonem p. 166. legitur <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. id est, Impera∣toris Titi Caesaris Vespasiani Augusti anno novo Sacro xi. Quo ex Titi nummo manifeste apparet, deceptos viros eruditos qui negant an∣nos Tiberii, Titi, aliorumque Imperii Collegarum numeratos fuisse. Haec porro epocha non nisi in Vespasiani, Titi, Domitiani &amp; Nervae nummis occurrit. Pagi Crit. in Baron. A. D. 81. n. iii.</NOTE> <HI>Augustus.</HI> Now
<PB N="483" REF="501"/>
<HI>Titus</HI> reigned alone after his father's death but a little
above two years.</P>
<P>IT will not be expected, I should here attempt to ex∣plain
the meaning of the epocha of the <HI>new sacred year.</HI>
All that I shall observe, is, that it appears not to have
been used upon the coins of any Emperours beside those
of <HI>Vespasian, Titus, Domitian</HI> and <HI>Nerva:</HI> And that it
does not begin at any one common period, such as the
building or dedication of any one particular Temple,
but that the numbers answer exactly to the years of the
several emperours on whose coins it is found<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Nisi enim hoc modo in nummis Titi, Domitiani &amp; Nervae epo∣cha haec explicetur, impossible est nummos inter se posse convenire; cum eorum imperii annos non excedat, sed ad amussim iis respondeat. Pagi. ibid.</NOTE>. And
Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> is of opinion, that it was an epocha chiefly
used by the people of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> because the
epithet <HI>sacred</HI> is more common upon their coins than
any others<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Et nullibi sacri nomen frequentius, quam in nummis in Syria &amp; Aegypto percussis, usurpatum. ibid. n. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but think, that there were for some
time different computations of the length of <HI>Nerva</HI>'s
and <HI>Trajan</HI>'s reigns; and that they were owing to this,
that <HI>Trajan</HI> was for some time <HI>Nerva</HI>'s Collegue in the
empire. Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vid. Append. ad Dissert. Cypr. n. 39, 40.</NOTE> was of opinion, that <HI>Nerva</HI>
did actually resign the empire to <HI>Trajan</HI> before his death.
And so<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Quid enim Nerva prudentius?—Qui cum extrema aetate apud Sequanos, quo Tyranni defecit metu, imperium arbitrio legionum cepisset; ubi pro∣spexit, nisi a superioribus robustioribus{que} corpore, animoque geri non posse, mense Sexto ac Decimo semet eo abdicavit.

to say. I think indeed that <HI>Nerva</HI> did not resign, not
only because <HI>Eutropius</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Diocletianus privatus in villa, quae haud procul a Salonis est, praeclaro otio senuit; inusitata virtute usus; ut solus omnium post conditum Romanum imperium ex tanto fastigio sponte ad privatae vi∣tae statum civilitatemque remearet. Eutrop. lib. ix. cap. 28.</NOTE> says that <HI>Diocletian</HI> was the
first of all the Roman Emperours that did so; but espe∣cially
<PB N="484" REF="502"/>
because the younger <HI>Plinie,</HI> who served under
<HI>Nerva</HI> and <HI>Trajan,</HI> and knew them both very well, says
nothing of it, though he often<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Assumptus es in laborum curarumque consortium, Plin. Paneg. c. 7. Inde QUASI deposito imperio qua securitate, qua gloria laetus?

Magnum hoc tuae mode∣rationis indicium, quod non solùm successor imperii, sed PARTICEPS etiam SOCIUSQUE placuisti, c. 9.</NOTE> mentions their joint
empire. But I think, that the notion which the fore∣mentioned
authors had of <HI>Nerva</HI>'s resigning may be ve∣ry
well accounted for upon the supposition, that they
had met with different computations of the time of these
two Princes reigns, in some ancient writers: And their
mistake is not easie to be accounted for otherwise.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tiberius,</HI> I take it for granted, that it has
been fully proved, that he was for some time partner in
the empire with <HI>Augustus;</HI> and particularly that it has
been made appear that <HI>Piso</HI> was Prefect of <HI>Rome</HI> twenty
years, and that he was put into that Post by the ap∣pointment
or procurement of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> Thus much I
think Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI> allows<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra, A. D. 11. n. ii.</NOTE>. And <HI>Suetonius</HI> and <HI>Pli∣nie</HI>
both say, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was <HI>then Prince.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is highly probable, that the first Christians
had a perswasion that there were two different epochaes
of the beginning of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign: Otherwise, when
they said, that Jesus was crucified in the fifteenth year
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> when the two <HI>Gemini</HI> were Consuls, namely
A. D. 29. (as they did almost universally) after he had
preached above<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tricesimo enim juxta Evangelistam Lucam anno aetatis suae coepit in carne Dominus Evangelium praedicare, &amp; juxta Johannem Evangelistam, per tria paschata duos postea implevit annos: &amp; inde sex Tuberii supputantur anni, &amp;c.

they must have been sensible, that they contradicted St.
<HI>Luke;</HI> who says, that the <HI>word of God came</HI> to <HI>John</HI> the
<HI>Baptist</HI> in the <HI>fifteenth year of</HI> Tiberius; since also they
must necessarily have allowed some time for the mini∣stry
of <HI>John,</HI> distinct from that of Jesus.</P>
<P>THAT we have so few examples of this way of com∣puting
the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> is not to be wondered; con∣sidering
how few ancient writers who lived near his time
are come down to us, and especially such as lived in
the provinces, where this epocha must have been chiefly
used. The distinct computation of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s reign to
the time of his death, and of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s after him was un∣doubtedly
most commodious: and for this reason, pro∣bably,
the computation of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign from the
time of his Proconsular empire was soon dropped. Be∣sides,
<HI>Tiberius</HI> seems to have taken pains to obliterate
this date of his government; inasmuch as he was un∣willing
to have it thought that he owed his greatnesse to
the adoption of <HI>Augustus,</HI> or the intrigues of his mo∣ther
<HI>Livia;</HI> but would have it ascribed solely to the
free choice of the people after <HI>Augustus</HI>'s death<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dabat &amp; famae, ut vocatus electusque potius a Republica videre∣tur, quam per uxorioum ambitum &amp; senilem adoptionem irrepsisse. Tacit. Ann. l. 1. c. 8.</NOTE>, that

<P><HI>TIBERIUS</HI> then having had for some time be∣fore
the death of <HI>Augustus</HI> equal power with him in all
the provinces and armies, and having been made there∣by
partner with him in the empire; it is not impossible,
but that St. <HI>Luke</HI> might compute the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI>
by this epocha.</P>
<P>WE should now, if possible, settle the exact time
when <HI>Tiberius</HI> was made partner with <HI>Augustus.</HI> It may
be concluded, that he was so, A. U. 765, two years
before <HI>Augustus</HI> died, because in that year <HI>Piso</HI> was
made prefect of <HI>Rome, Tiberius being Prince.</HI> And Arch∣bishop
<PB N="486" REF="504"/>
<HI>Usher</HI> and Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> place the beginning of
this government of <HI>Tiberius</HI> in this year.</P>
<P>THERE is however a considerable difficulty attend∣ing
this matter, because <HI>Velleius</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> differ
about the time in which the law was passed by the Se∣nate,
decreeing <HI>Tiberius</HI> equal power with <HI>Augustus</HI> in the
provinces and armies. According to <HI>Suetonius</HI> this law
was not passed till after <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s triumph, which cer∣tainly
happened, A. U. 765. A. D. 12. But accord∣ing
to <HI>Velleius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in Tiber. c. 21, 22. Velleius Pat. l ii. c. 121. Their words are transcribed above, p. 471.</NOTE> this law was passed at the desire of
<HI>Augustus,</HI> before <HI>Tiberius</HI> returned to <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Ger∣many</HI>
to make his triumph. Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid. Crit. A. Ch. 11. n. x.</NOTE> is inclined
to prefer the testimony of <HI>Velleius Paterculus</HI> before that
of <HI>Suetonius,</HI> because <HI>Velleius</HI> was contemporary with
<HI>Tiberius.</HI> But yet he dares not be positive in this mat∣ter,
because St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s numbers are different from
both. However, as <HI>Tiberius</HI> was Consul in the 21st,
and 31st years of our Lord, he judges this piece of re∣spect
to the tenth and twentieth years from the 11th year
of our Lord, to<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Quia tamen Tiberius anno Christi xxi. rursusque an∣no Christi xxxi. Consul processit, existimandum, utrumque consula∣tum ob Decennalia &amp; Vicennalia Imperii Proconsularis Tiberii ge∣stum, ideoque &amp; illum anno Christi xi. Imperio Proconsulari dona∣tum: quamquam uterque consulatus anno Christi xii. quo rem actam narrat Suetonius, respondere etiam possit, etiamsi quinquennalia legi∣timo tempore celebrata fuerint. id. ibid.</NOTE> be a confirmation of the supposition
that <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular power commenced, A. D.
11. He observes also marks of honour shewn to the
<HI>Quinquennals</HI> of this epocha, such as the dedication of
temples by himself or the people of the provinces, the
founding of cities by dependent princes, and such other
the like things, with which the <HI>Quinquennals</HI> and <HI>Decen∣nals,</HI>
that is, the fifth and tenth years of remarkable
events, were wont to be celebrated.</P>
<P>As he thinks it most probable, that <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Pro∣consular
empire began, A. U. 764. A. D. 11; so he
is pretty well satisfied as to the month and day of the
<PB N="487" REF="505"/>
month; which he thinks was the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> or
vth of the <HI>Kalends</HI> of <HI>September.</HI> One reason for it is,
that from the 725th year of the City, <HI>Augustus</HI> seems to
have had a particular respect for the vth of the <HI>Kalends</HI>
of months. Moreover, according to the second compu∣tation
which <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> mentions of the reign
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> it must have begun on the 28th of <HI>August.</HI>
St. <HI>Clement</HI> says, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> reigned twenty six years,
six months, nineteen days. Now <HI>Tiberius</HI> dies the 16th
of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37. From the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> A. D.
10. to the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37, are exactly (ac∣cording
to Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI>'s reckoning) so many years, months,
and days as St. <HI>Clement</HI> mentions. So that though St.
<HI>Clement</HI> has been in the wrong as to the year, since he
begins this computation of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign, A. D. 10;
yet he has helped us to the month and day of the month
on which it commenced.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Quare Clemens Alexandrinus rei gestae diem nobis conservavit, sed numeri annorum corrupti, quod in eo auctore non infrequen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Pagi. Critic. A. D. 11. n. ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE represented the Doctor's sense of this mat∣ter,
as well as I can, in a few words. But I cannot say,
that this reasoning is altogether convincing. I must ac∣knowledge,
I see now how any argument can be drawn
from St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s testimony, either for the year or
month of this epocha; if his numbers have been altered,
as the Doctor allows they have been in many places, and
particularly in this very passage.</P>
<P>THERE appears to me some weight in the Doctor's
observation upon the <HI>Quinquennals</HI> and <HI>Decennals</HI> of this
epocha: But yet it is not fully conclusive. There might
be some other reason, beside that here supposed, for
<HI>Tiberus</HI>'s taking the Consulship, A. D. 21, and 31. The
22d, and 26th years of the Christian Aera are as re∣markable
as any other for the founding of cities, dedi∣cating
temples, and erecting of monuments. Though
indeed, if this epocha began in the middle of any year,
it is obvious at first sight, that these honours may be
divided betwixt two years.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="506"/>
AND perhaps <HI>Velleius Paterculus</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> may
be reconciled by supposing only, that there was some
time between <HI>Augustus</HI>'s proposing <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s partnership
with him to the Senate, and the passing of the Act.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I think, there is good reason to
believe, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was Collegue in the empire with
<HI>Augustus;</HI> and that this epocha of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s empire was
followed for some time by some persons, in the provinces
at lest: but it appears to me uncertain, when this Pro∣consular
empire began, whether about <HI>two</HI> years, or
about <HI>three</HI> years before <HI>Augustus</HI> died.</P>
<P>LET us however adjust the numbers in St. <HI>Luke</HI> to
this computation of the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> which com∣menced
either about two years, or about three years
before his sole empire after the death of <HI>Augustus.</HI> And
we will have an eye to the two dates of oar Saviour's
nativity abovementioned, <HI>sc. September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> A. U.
748, and 749.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular empire began about <HI>three</HI>
years before <HI>Augustus</HI> died, <HI>sc.</HI> the 28th of <HI>Aug.</HI> A. U.
764. A. D. 11. then this 15th of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign (ac∣cording
to this computation of it) began <HI>August</HI> 28.
A. U. 778. A. D 25. Supposing that <HI>John the Baptist</HI>
began his ministry <HI>November</HI> following, in the same
year, and that Jesus was baptized by him the 6th of
<HI>January</HI> following in A. U. 779. A. D. 26: Then
upon the supposition that Jesus was born in <HI>September,</HI>
A. U. 748, he would be at his baptism thirty years of
age and some months over.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular empire commenced about
<HI>two</HI> years before the death of <HI>Augustus, sc.</HI> A. U. 765.
A. D. 12, then the fifteenth of the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> be∣gan
in A. U. 779. A. D. 26. And supposing that <HI>John
the Baptist</HI> began his ministry in <HI>November</HI> of that year,
and that Jesus was baptized by him the 6th of <HI>January</HI>
following, A. U. 780. A. D. 27, then, upon the sup∣position
that Jesus was born in <HI>September,</HI> A. U. 749,
he would be at the time of his baptism thirty years of
age and some months over: Or, if born A. U. 748,
<PB N="489" REF="507"/>
he would be somewhat more than thirty one years of
age.</P>
<P>WE will put this matter one way more. If <HI>John the
Baptist</HI> began his ministry in the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
A. U. 778. A. D. 25. (as in the first stating of this
question) but did not baptize Jesus till the 6th of <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI>
A. U. 780. A. D. 27, after he had preached
somewhat above a year, then Jesus would be at his
baptism thirty years of age and odd months, if he was
born, A. U. 749; thirty one years of age and some
odd months, if born the latter end of the year 748.</P>
<P>I SEE not but that we have a very good right to take
those dates of these events, which appear most favourable
to St. <HI>Luke;</HI> since it is not absolutely certain when <HI>He∣rod</HI>
died, or when <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular empire began:
nor have any of the writers of harmonies determined,
that I know of, beyond contradiction, the space of time
between the commencement of <HI>John the Baptist</HI>'s mini∣stry
and our Saviour's baptism. But if we allow on each
hand the dates the lest favourable to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s numbers,
<HI>viz.</HI> that Jesus was born, A. U. 748. and that he was
not baptized till <HI>January,</HI> A. U. 780. A. D. 27; yet
even then Jesus would be little more (as has been
shewn) than thirty one years of age; at which time a
person may be said very properly to be ABOUT <HI>thirty
years of age,</HI> as will appear by and by.</P>
<P>I IMAGINE I have now shewed, that there is nothing
improbable in the supposition, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> computed
the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> not from his sole empire after the
death of <HI>Augustus,</HI> but from the time of his Proconsu∣lar
empire, when he had equal power with <HI>Augustus</HI> gi∣ven
him in all the provinces and armies, and that upon
this supposition, there lies no objection against the age
ascribed to Jesus at his baptism.</P>
<P>§ III. HOWEVER, in order to compleat this solu∣tion
of this difficulty, it will be proper to consider some
other notes of time, which we find in the Evangelists;
and to enquire, whether these likewise agree with this
supposition.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="508"/>
ST. <HI>Luke</HI> says: <HI>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of</HI>
Tiberius Cesar, PONTIUS PILATE BEING GOVERNOUR
OF JUDEA,—<HI>the word of God came unto</HI> John <HI>the son
of</HI> Zacharias, <HI>Luke</HI> iii. 1, 2.</P>
<P>IT has been the opinion of some learned men, that
<HI>Pilate</HI> did not come into <HI>Judea</HI> so soon as the fifteenth
year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular empire, the 12th of his
sole empire, A. U. 778. A. D. 25.</P>
<P>THAT every one may judge of this matter, I shall
set down the account <HI>Josephus</HI> has given of <HI>Pilates</HI>'s leav∣ing
<HI>Judea;</HI> from which we shall be able to conclude,
when he came into it.</P>
<P>THE Senate of the <HI>Samaritans</HI> sent complaints against
<HI>Pilate</HI> to <HI>Vitellius,</HI> President of <HI>Syria.</HI> And <HI>Josephus</HI>
says: “<HI>Vitellius,</HI> sending his friend <HI>Marcellus</HI> to admi∣nister
the affairs of <HI>Judea,</HI> commanded <HI>Pilate</HI> to go to
<HI>Rome</HI> to answer to the Emperour for those things of
which he was accused by the <HI>Jews.</HI> And <HI>Pilate</HI> ha∣ving
spent TEN YEARS IN JUDEA, hastned away to
<HI>Rome,</HI> in obedience to the commands of <HI>Vitellius,</HI> not
daring to refuse. But before he got to <HI>Rome, Tibe∣rius</HI>
was dead.”</P>
<P>“MOREOVER <HI>Vitellius</HI> came into <HI>Judea,</HI> and went
up to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> It was then a Feast time. The Feast
is called the PASSOVER. <HI>Vitellius</HI> being received there
with great magnificence, abolished entirely the tax
upon vendibel fruits, and granted to the Priests the
right of keeping in the temple the Vestment of the
High Priest and all its Ornaments, as they had done
formerly.—Having conferred these favours upon
the nation, he also took away the Priesthood from
the High Priest <HI>Joseph,</HI> who is likewise called <HI>Caia∣phas,</HI>
and substituted in his room <HI>Jonathan</HI> the son of
<HI>Ananus</HI> the High Priest. And then returned to
<HI>Antioch</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Joseph. Ant. lib. 18. cap. v. §. 2, 3. p. 801. 802.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="491" REF="509"/>
<HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> immediately after this says, that
<HI>Tiberius</HI> sent orders to <HI>Vitellius</HI> to go and make a league
with the King of the <HI>Parthians;</HI> that <HI>Vitellius</HI> having had
a meeting with the King at the river <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and
executed his commission, returned again to<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid. p. 802. 803.</NOTE> <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this <HI>Vitellius</HI> received orders from <HI>Tiberius</HI> to
go and make war with <HI>Aretas</HI> King of <HI>Petra.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>VITELLIUS</HI> then having got all things ready
for the war with <HI>Aretas,</HI> hastened away for <HI>Petra</HI> with
two legions, and other auxiliary forces, and was come
as far as <HI>Ptolemais.</HI> But as he was about to march his
army thro' <HI>Judea,</HI> the chief men met him, entreating
him not to go through their country;—He com∣plied
with their request. And having ordered his ar∣my
to take their rout through the great plain, he
himself with <HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch and their friends
went up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to worship God, a Feast of the
<HI>Jews</HI> being at hand<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. He was received by the
people of the <HI>Jews</HI> with great respect. Having been
there three days, he took away the High Priesthood
from <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and gave it to his brother <HI>Theophilus.</HI>
And on the fourth day after his arrival, receiving let∣ters
which brought him an account of the death of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> he took an oath of the people to <HI>Caius</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. cap. vi. §. 3.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>A FEW remarks on this account will suffice.</P>
<P>IT is now expressly said, which feast of the <HI>Jews</HI> the
last mentioned feast was: But there can be no doubt,
but that it was the Passover, A. D. 37. I think this is
<PB N="492" REF="510"/>
not contested by any one. <HI>Tiberius</HI> died the 16th of
<HI>March.</HI> A. D. 37. The news of his death might easily
reach <HI>Judea</HI> by the Passover of that year, and could not
be retarded to the feast of <HI>Pentecost.</HI></P>
<P>THE Passover first mentioned in this account must
have been the Passover, A. D. 36. It is evident, that
the summer following <HI>Vitellius</HI> went as far as the river
<HI>Euphrates,</HI> and returned to <HI>Antioch:</HI> and the next spring
he was to go and make war with <HI>Aretas.</HI> But whilst his
troops marched toward <HI>Petra,</HI> he went up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
at the Passover in the year thirty seven, as has been ob∣served.
Nothing can be plainer, I think, than that
<HI>Pilate</HI> was removed before the Passover in thirty six.
And must have been out some time before. <HI>Vitellius</HI> did
not go to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> immediately after he had sent away
<HI>Pilate,</HI> but first ordered his friend <HI>Marcellus</HI> to take
care of affairs there.</P>
<P>IT is not said here, how long <HI>Pilate</HI> had been out,
before <HI>Vitellius</HI> went up to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> but it is proba∣ble,
it was half a year. This may be concluded from
hence: <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Vitellius,</HI> when he was at <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
the first time here spoken of, put the High
Priest's vestment into the Priest's hands to be kept by
them in the temple. <HI>Josephus</HI> is very expresse, that this
favour was conferred by <HI>Vitellius</HI> upon the nation at this
time, and that having done so, he put out <HI>Caiaphas</HI> and
returned to <HI>Antioch.</HI> Now in another place <HI>Josephus</HI> says:
“This Vestment King <HI>Herod</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. lib. xv. c. xi. §. 4.</NOTE> kept here [<HI>in the Castle
of</HI> Antonia]. And after his death it was kept in the
same place by the <HI>Romans</HI> till the time of <HI>Tiberius Ce∣sar.</HI>
In his reign <HI>Vitellius</HI> president of <HI>Syria,</HI> having
come to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the people receiving him in
a very honourable manner, he being willing to make
<PB N="493" REF="511"/>
them a suitable return, since they had desired that the
sacred vestment might be in their own custody, wrote
to <HI>Tiberius Cesar</HI> about it, and he granted their re∣quest”
From this passage it appears, that <HI>Vitel∣lius</HI>
did not put the High Priest's Vestment into the
hands of the <HI>Jews</HI> without leave from <HI>Tiberius.</HI> If <HI>Vi∣tellius</HI>
actually made this grant, when he was at <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>
at the Passover, A. D. <HI>thirty six,</HI> (as <HI>Josephus</HI> says
expressly in the first passage) it is likely the <HI>Jews</HI> had
sent their request to him about the time that <HI>Pilate</HI> was
removed. And considering the slownesse of <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
all his proceedings, it will not be thought strange, that
we allow half a year between the <HI>Jews</HI> presenting their
request to <HI>Vitellius</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and the return of an answer
from the Emperour: It is rather surprizing it should
have come back so soon.</P>
<P>IT is possible that some may except against this ar∣gument,
and say, that the grant was not made by <HI>Vi∣tellius,</HI>
when he was at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> but that he there re∣ceived
the <HI>Jews</HI> request, then wrote to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and
some time after this put the sacred Vestment into their
custody. But though <HI>Josephus</HI> does in this last passage
seem to place things in this order; yet I should think
that since in the passage first cited, he says <HI>Vitellius</HI> be∣stowed
this favour upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> whilst at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
at that time; it may be inferred, that the petition had
been presented to him whilst in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that he
brought <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s grant to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though this argument should not be
allowed me, yet since upon <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal <HI>Marcellus</HI>
was sent to govern in <HI>Judea,</HI> it is plain there was some
time between <HI>Vitellius</HI>'s issuing his order to <HI>Pilate</HI> to go
to <HI>Rome,</HI> and his own Journey to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> This time
might be the space of five or six months, and I appre∣hend
that the probability at lest of my reasoning above,
that <HI>Vitellius</HI> received the <HI>Jews</HI> petition for keeping the
High Priest's Vestment in <HI>Syria,</HI> then wrote to <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
and delivered it to them, when he was at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
may very much dispose us to admit the supposition of
this space.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="512"/>
AND though it should be thought, that at the Pas∣sover
next after <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal <HI>Vitellius</HI> did not give the
High Priest's Vestment into the <HI>jewish</HI> hands, but only
received their petition for the favour; yet this does
fully overthrow the opinion of those, who have thought,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed but a few weeks before the
death of <HI>Tiberius. Vitellius,</HI> after the removal of <HI>Pilate,</HI>
was at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at a Passover; and having been mag∣nificently
received by the <HI>Jews,</HI> in requital of their ci∣vilities
wrote to <HI>Tiberius</HI> (so we will suppose at present)
that they might have the keeping of the High Priest's
garment, and <HI>Tiberius</HI> granted it. This Passover then
was not that Passover, at which <HI>Vitellius,</HI> being at
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> heard of the death of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> We are
therefore fully assured, that the Passover which followed
the removal of <HI>Pilate</HI> was not the Passover, A. D. 37,
before which <HI>Tiberius</HI> died, but the Passover preceding,
<HI>viz.</HI> that in A. D. 36.</P>
<P>IT is certain then, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed before
the Passover, A. D. 36; and probable, that he was re∣moved
about five or six months before it, namely, about
<HI>September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> A. D. 35, about a year and a half
before the death of <HI>Tiberius.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Pilate</HI> spent <HI>ten</HI> years in
<HI>Judea;</HI> he came thither about <HI>October,</HI> A. D. 25, or
at lest before the Passover, A. D. 26, in the twelfth
year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s sole empire, which twelfth year began
the nineteenth of <HI>August,</HI> A. D. 25. This also is per∣fectly
consistent with what <HI>Josephus</HI> says of <HI>Valerius
Gratus,</HI> the first Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Tiberius;</HI>
“that he spent eleven years in <HI>Judea,</HI> and was then suc∣ceeded
by <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 18. c. 2. §. 2.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>So that though we should suppose that <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Pro∣consular empire began three years before the death of
<HI>Augustus,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> is inclined to do, <HI>sc.</HI> 28 <HI>August,</HI>
A. U. 764. A. D. 11; yet <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> would even
<PB N="495" REF="513"/>
then be in <HI>Judea</HI> in the fifteenth of that Empire, which
began <HI>Aug.</HI> 28, A. U. 778. A. D. 25.</P>
<P>THERE is one difficulty, and but one in all this
matter. <HI>Josephus</HI> says that “<HI>Pilate</HI>—hastened away
to <HI>Rome</HI> in obedience to the commands of <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
not daring to refuse. But before he got to <HI>Rome,
Tiberius</HI> was dead.”</P>
<P>IT will be best to take the objection from Mr. <HI>Whi∣ston.</HI>
“Now it is known from <HI>Josephus</HI> that <HI>Pontius Pi∣late</HI>
was Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> but ten years; and that
he was put out so little before the death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
that the Emperour was actually dead before <HI>Pilate</HI> ar∣rived
at <HI>Rome</HI> to answer for himself. <HI>Tiberius</HI> died
<HI>March</HI> 26.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I suppose that Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> herein follows <HI>Dio</HI> (unless it be a fault of the press): But according to <HI>Suetonius</HI> and <HI>Tacitus, Tiberius</HI> died the 16th of <HI>March.

of his office a month, or six weeks before, suppose

which will therefore fall into <HI>February,</HI> A. D. 27.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whiston</HI>'s short view of the harmony of the four Evangelists▪ pag. 139.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THIS is the difficulty: But I think, it would be ve∣ry
wrong to be determined by one single sentence against
all the evidence which arises from the whole series of a
narration. It is extremely evident, that the feast time,
in which <HI>Vitellius,</HI> being at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> heard of the
death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> is not the Passover which followed
next after <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal. I shall not repeat particu∣lars,
but content my self with referring the reader to
<HI>Josephus</HI>'s account, already transcribed.</P>
<P>AND if this one sentence about the time of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
arrival at <HI>Rome</HI> be inconsistent with the rest of the story;
it is more reasonable to suppose, that <HI>Josephus</HI> was mis∣taken
in this particular, than in every thing else. He
might be misinformed about the time when <HI>Pilate</HI> got
to <HI>Rome,</HI> but he could not well be ignorant of some of
the most remarkable events in his own country, that is,
<PB N="496" REF="514"/>
when <HI>Pilate</HI> left <HI>Judea,</HI> when <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> and
his succes∣sor
<HI>Jonathan</HI> were put out of the High Priest's Office.</P>
<P>BUT there is no reason to suppose, this particular is
inconsistent with the other circumstances mentioned in
this relation. Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> indeed can allow but a <HI>month</HI>
or <HI>six weeks</HI> between the time of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal out of
his office and his arrival at <HI>Rome.</HI> But it ought to be
considered, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was not sent to <HI>Rome</HI> in order to
take possession of a kingdome or some new ample pro∣vince,
but to answer for his conduct in his late govern∣ment.
Nor was he sent express: Nor was he recalled
by the Emperour himself. But he was sent away by
<HI>Vitellius,</HI> a fellow subject, though a superiour officer.
<HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Pilate hastened away to Rome.</HI> I
have given his words the strongest sense in the transla∣tion:
but I think, the meaning is no more than that he
went away out of <HI>Judea.</HI> And <HI>Josehus</HI> intimates very
plainly the reluctance with which <HI>Pilate</HI> obeyed <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
when he says, that he went, not <HI>daring to refuse.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was, if I mistake not, some law under the
Commonwealth, which required the Governours of pro∣vinces
to be at <HI>Rome</HI> in three months time after their
term of government was expired: But whether that law
was in force now, I cannot say. However it is plain it
was not observed: <HI>Piso</HI>'s conduct is a proof of it. <HI>Ger∣manicus</HI>
died in <HI>November</HI> or<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Basnage</HI> [Ann. Polit. Ec. Vol. 1. p. 221.] suppose he died in <HI>July.

I suppose, the <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> which were celebrated in the
middle of that month. And as <HI>Germanicus</HI> died in <HI>Syria,</HI>
some time must be allowed for the carrying the news
of his death from thence to <HI>Rome. Piso</HI> was gone from
<PB N="497" REF="515"/>
the province of <HI>Syria</HI> before the death of <HI>Germanicus.</HI> It
is most probable, that he was turned out by <HI>Germani∣cus</HI>
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Addunt plerique jussum [<HI>Pisonem</HI>] provinciae decedere. Tacit. Ann. l. ii. c. 70.</NOTE>. And yet he was not come to <HI>Rome</HI> at the time
of the <HI>Megalensian</HI> games of the next year, which were
kept on the fifth of <HI>April</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Et quia Ludorum Megalensium spectacu∣lum suberat, <HI>etiam voluptates resumerent.</HI> Tum exuto justitio, reditum ad munia; &amp; Drusus Illyricos ad exercitus profectus est, erectis om∣nium animis petendae a Pisone ultionis; &amp; crebro questu, <HI>quod vagus interim per amoena Asiae atque Achaiae, adroganti &amp; subdola mora sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ierum probationes subverteret.</HI> Tacit. Ann. lib. iii. cap. 6, 7.</NOTE>. It is true, the people of
<HI>Rome</HI> were very uneasy at these delays of <HI>Piso;</HI> because
they wanted to have him brought to his trial for the
death of <HI>Germanicus,</HI> whom he was thought to have
poysoned. But yet I do not perceive that when<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. c. 13.</NOTE> his
trial came on, his long absence from <HI>Rome</HI> is reckoned
up amongst his other crimes.</P>
<P>AND to add no more, the slownesse of <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
all his proceedings may help us to account for <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
delays in going to <HI>Rome,</HI> though it be supposed that he
made a year and a half of it.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> says, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was the most di∣latory
Prince that ever lived<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. lib. 18. pag. 811. v. 3.</NOTE>. His conduct toward
<HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> affords a strong proof of it. A servant of
<HI>Agrippa</HI> waited upon the Prefect of <HI>Rome,</HI> assuring him
he had some informations of great consequence to give
the Emperour relating to his master. The Perfect sent
him to <HI>Tiberius;</HI> but he, without making any particu∣lar
enquiry into the matter, only keeps the man safe in
custody. <HI>Agrippa</HI> lying under the Emperour's displea∣sure
was forced to make interest to have his servant
heard. And though he then informed the Emperour of
words spoken by <HI>Agrippa</HI> which were little less than
treason, and <HI>Agrippa</HI> was immediately thereupon con∣fined;
yet he was never called for again, though <HI>Tiberius</HI>
lived six months<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Joseph. Ant. 18. c. vii.</NOTE> after. <HI>Tacitus</HI> has mentioned ano∣ther
<PB N="498" REF="516"/>
instance well nigh, or quite as remarkable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Consultusque Caesar <HI>an sepeliri sineret, (De Asinio Gallo loquitur</HI>) non erubuit permittere, ultroque incusare <HI>casus, qui reum abstulissent antequam coram convinceretur.</HI> Scilicet medio triennio defuerat tempus subeundi judicium consulari seni tot consularium parenti. Tacit. Ann. l. vi. c. 23.</NOTE>.
This slow way of thinking and acting was visible in <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>
in his very youth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Saeva ac lenta natura ne in puero quidem latuit. Sueton. in Tiber. c. 57. Sed mitigavit Sejanus, non Galli amore, verum ut cunctationes principis aperirentur; gnarus eum lent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m in meditando. Tacit. Ann. lib. iv. c. 71.</NOTE>. And no historian of those
times is silent about it. <HI>Pilate,</HI> who had served <HI>Tiberius</HI>
ten years, could not be ignorant of what all the world
knew. He might have many probable reasons to think,
that if he did not come in the Emperour's way, he
should never be called for. If enquiry was made for
him, an excuse might be found out that would serve for
some time. Sicknesse might be pretended, as a reason
for his stay in <HI>Asia, Achaia,</HI> or some other place where
he was got. Perhaps this was really the case. To be
put out of his Government by <HI>Vitellius,</HI> upon the com∣plaints
of the people of his province, must have been a
very grievous mortification. <HI>Eusebius</HI> assures us, that
not long after this <HI>Pilate</HI> made away with himself out of
vexation for his many misfortunes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Euseb. Chron. p. 78.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another note of time mentioned in St. <HI>John</HI>'s
Gospel, which ought also to be considered. <HI>Then said
the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building:
and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</HI> John ii. 20.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE, that the objection to be formed upon
this text is to this effect. These words were spoken by
the <HI>Jews</HI> at the first Passover of our Saviour's public
ministry, and the next after his Baptism by <HI>John.</HI> The
temple, which the <HI>Jews</HI> spoke of, was the temple then
before their eyes, and which <HI>Herod</HI> had rebuilt or re∣paired.
But <HI>Herod</HI> did not make the proposal for re∣building
it till the eighteenth year of his reign, reckon∣ing
<PB N="499" REF="517"/>
from the death of <HI>Antigonus.</HI> Therefore, if the
fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> be
the fifteenth of his Proconsular empire, and not of
his sole empire after the death of <HI>Augustus;</HI> this temple
could not have been so long as <HI>forty six years</HI> in building,
at the time these words were spoken.</P>
<P>To this I might answer, That an objection taken
from <HI>Josephus</HI>'s account of the time when <HI>Herod</HI> repaired
the temple can be of little moment: because in one
place he says, that <HI>Herod</HI> repaired the temple in the fif∣teenth
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. i. c. 21. init.</NOTE>, and in another the eighteenth year<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. xv. c. xi. init.</NOTE> of
his reign. As the fifteenth year from the death of <HI>An∣tigonus</HI>
is supposed to be coincident with the eighteenth
year from the time in which <HI>Herod</HI> was declared King of
<HI>Judea</HI> by the Senate of <HI>Rome;</HI> some may be disposed to
conclude, that when <HI>Josephus</HI> says <HI>Herod</HI>'s proposal to
rebuild the Temple was made to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the eigh∣teenth
year of his reign, he computes from the time in
which <HI>Herod</HI> was declared King by the Roman Senate.</P>
<P>BUT I do not insist upon this, and am willing to al∣low,
that <HI>Herod</HI> made the proposal to the <HI>Jews</HI> of build∣ing
their temple in the eighteenth year of his reign from
the death of <HI>Antigonus.</HI></P>
<P>AND I think it is as likely, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> in these
words recorded by St. <HI>John,</HI> refer to the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s
proposal, as to the time in which he began actually to
repair the temple. It is most probable, that <HI>Herod</HI>
made this offer to the <HI>jewish</HI> people, when assembled to∣gether
at one of their great feasts. This therefore would
be the most solemn and remarkable epocha of rebuild∣ing
the temple, which work undoubtedly he set about
as soon afterwards as he could.</P>
<P>AND it is very common to say, that men do things,
when they propose to do them, or begin to do them.
Thus <HI>Josephus</HI> says in his <HI>War of the Jews:</HI> “In the fif∣teenth
year of his reign he [<HI>Herod</HI>] repaired the tem∣ple
it self, and enclosed a spot of ground about it, of
<PB N="500" REF="518"/>
double the compass with that which surrounded it be∣fore.
This was done at a vast expence, and is a proof
of his uncommon magnificence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. lib. i. cap. 21. init.</NOTE>.” We will allow,
that the fifteenth year in this place ought to be correct∣ed
by his <HI>Antiquities;</HI> where he says, that “in the eigh∣teenth
year of his reign <HI>Herod</HI> projected [or under∣took]
the rebuilding the Temple, which was the
greatest of all his works<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. lib. xv. cap. xi. i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it.</NOTE>.” But then it appears
from hence, that <HI>Herod</HI> is said by <HI>Josephus</HI> in one place
to <HI>do</HI> what in another he is only said at the same time to
<HI>propose</HI> or begin.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING, that the <HI>Jews</HI> in this text of St. <HI>John</HI>
refer to the time, in which <HI>Herod</HI> made the proposal
of rebuilding the temple; we will see how this term of
forty six years will agree with the supposition, that
St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius</HI> is the fifteenth of his
Proconsular empire.</P>
<P>IF the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Proconsular Empire be∣gan
the 28th of <HI>August</HI> A. U. 778. A. D. 25. (accord∣ing
to Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI>'s opinion) and if <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> began
to preach in <HI>November</HI> that year, but did not baptize
Jesus till after he had preached a year and some months,
then the Passover at which these words were spoken was
the Passover A. U. 780. A. D. 27.</P>
<P>OR if the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign began A. U.
779, A. D. 26, and <HI>John</HI> began then to preach, and
Jesus was baptized by him, some time before the passo∣ver
next following; still these words would be spoke by
the <HI>Jews</HI> at the Passover A. U. 780. A. D. 27.</P>
<P>THE eighteenth year of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, from the
death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> is supposed to have begun some time
in A. U. 734. <HI>Herod</HI> might make his offer to the <HI>Jews</HI>
of rebuilding the Temple at the Feast of Tabernacles,
<PB N="501" REF="519"/>
in <HI>November</HI> that year. From <HI>November</HI> A. U. 734. to
the Passover A. U. 780. A. D. 27, is almost forty five
years and an half. At this time therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> might
not improperly say, the temple had been <HI>forty six years
in building.</HI> The forty sixth year was then current. And
it was to the purpose of the <HI>Jews,</HI> rather to add to,
than to diminish the time which had been spent in that
work. So that there is no time more suitable to these
words of the <HI>Jews</HI> than the Passover A. D. 27. Though
there is no manner of inconsistence between understand∣ing
the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> of his Proconsular empire,
and supposing that these words were spoken at the Passo∣ver
A. D. 28. And then the temple might have been
above forty six years in building.</P>
<P>WHAT has been here said, may be sufficient to
shew, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> might compute the reign of <HI>Tiberi∣us</HI>
from the epocha of his Proconsular Empire; that if
he did, Jesus might be said, with great exactnesse and
propriety, to be <HI>about thirty years of age</HI> at his baptism;
and that there is nothing in this supposition inconsistent
with any other notes of time mentioned in the Gospels.</P>
<P>§. IV. ANOTHER way of solving this difficulty is
this. These words of St. <HI>Luke, And Jesus himself be∣gan
to be about thirty years of age,</HI> may be understood
with some latitude. Jesus might be thirty<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ex nostrâ quidem Chronologiâ, sequitur Christum jam annum xxxii. evasisse cum ad baptismum accessit.

<P>IT is <HI>Kepler</HI>'s opinion, that round and decimal num∣bers
may be used with great latitude: And that a per∣son
may be very truly said to be about thirty years of
age, if he be above five and twenty and under thirty
five: But that, if a person be said to be about eight and
twenty, or about two and thirty years of age, it is to be
supposed he is exactly so old, or not above a month
or two more or less<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hic receptus mos est linguis omnibus ut circiter 5000 dicamus quickquid est inter 4500 &amp; 5500.

<P>AND indeed many examples of this use of round

to be a hint, that the writer does intend to be under∣stood

<P>IF we may take St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words in this manner,
there is scarce any need that I should trouble the reader
with any calculation, to shew the agreement of his
numbers with the time of our Saviour's nativity.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="521"/>
THE fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> sole empire began A. U.
781. A. D. 28. If Jesus was baptized the 6th <HI>January</HI>
A. U. 782, A. D. 29, he would be but some months
above thirty three years of age, though he was born so
soon as <HI>September</HI> A. U. 748. And if he was born
A. U. 749, then, though his baptism be placed in the
beginning of A. U. 783, A. D. 30, still he would be
little more than thirty three years of age.</P>
<P>ALL the other notes of time in the Gospels are also
very easily reconciled with this fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> sole
Empire. <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> came into <HI>Judea</HI> before the
Passover in the 12th year of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> sole Empire,
A. U. 779, A. D. 26. (as has been shewn): And con∣tinued
there <HI>ten</HI> years. Therefore he was undoubtedly
Governour of <HI>Judea</HI> at the commencement of <HI>John</HI> the
<HI>Baptist's</HI> ministry, and till after our Saviour's cruci∣fixion.</P>
<P>As for those words of the <HI>Jews</HI> spoken by them at
the first Passover of our Saviour's ministry, <HI>Forty six
years has this temple been in building,</HI> it is but to suppose
that they referred not to the time when <HI>Herod</HI> made the
proposal of repairing the temple in the 18th year of his
reign, but to the time when in pursuance of that pro∣posal
he actually set about the work, after he had got
all things in a readinesse for it, and it will be easily per∣ceived
that these words are agreeable to truth.</P>
<P>I DO not presume to determine, which of these two
solutions is the justest: or whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> intended
the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> Proconsular Empire when he
was made Collegue with <HI>Augustus,</HI> or the fifteenth of his
sole Empire. In order to do this, it would be needful,
as I apprehend, to consider the time allotted by the
Evangelists to the ministry of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> and our
Saviour, the Chronology of the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI>
compared with some passages in the Epistles, and also
the testimonies of the ancient Christian writers. As I
have not here room for all these premises, it may be
best to wave the conclusion. All I shall say at present
is, that the supposition, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> intended the for∣mer
<PB N="504" REF="522"/>
of these two epochaes, seems to be very much fa∣voured
by the first Christians, who generally place the
crucifixion of Jesus at the Passover of the 15th of <HI>Ti∣berius's</HI>
sole Empire, when the two <HI>Gemini</HI> were Consuls
of <HI>Rome,</HI> A. D. 29: And that their testimonies are
of great weight with me.

<P>I APPREHEND, that each of these is a very good
solution of the objection stated at the beginning of this
chapter; though I believe many will think, it is there
stated by me in a manner very favourable to an objector.
Nay, I imagine I have said what is sufficient to satisfy
any reasonable person, that there does not lie any objec∣tion
against any notes of time mentioned by the Evan∣gelists
from the Chronology of other ancient writers.
This is sufficient to my present purpose.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing farther to add here, beside this one
observation.</P>
<P>IT is no disparagement to the sacred Historians, that
we are somewhat at a loss to settle precisely the very
year of some of those events which they have related.
Many important facts related by the best historians are
attended with Chronological difficulties. I shall give
but one instance, an instance with which we are nearly
concerned. <HI>Josephus</HI> was a man of a learned educa∣tion,
is a professed writer of history, of the civil and
sacred history of his country: and is generally allowed
<PB N="505" REF="523"/>
be an accurate writer. He has expresly mentioned two
epochaes of the commencement of <HI>Herod's</HI> reign, and
has given us an account of his death, and the duration
of his government. He has writ the history of the
whole reign of this Prince. He has related the series of
events, and the succession of the Princes and Governours
of <HI>Judea</HI> before and after <HI>Herod.</HI> He has put down the
years of the <HI>Olympiads,</HI> and the names of the Consuls,
when some of the most remarkable of these events hap∣pened.
Nor have all <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> historians been
silent about <HI>Herod</HI> or his descendents, and the <HI>jewish</HI> Af∣fairs,
near this time: Not to mention <HI>Talmudical</HI> or
other <HI>jewish</HI> authors. And yet, notwithstanding all these
advantages, whether through prejudice or want of suf∣ficient
light, it has happened, that learned men have
differed widely about the time of <HI>Herod's</HI> death, and are
not yet come to a full agreement.</P>

my own sentiments concerning this matter in a few par∣ticulars;

<P><PB N="507" REF="525"/>
1. IT would be extremely unreasonable to impute to
<HI>St Luke</HI> so great a mistake, as the supposing, that there
were properly two High-Priests among the <HI>Jews</HI> at the
same time. He appears in the rest of his history well
acquainted with <HI>jewish</HI> affairs. It is plain, that he knew
very well, there was one who was in the office of
High-Priest: ch. xxii. 50. <HI>And one of them smote the ser∣vant
of the</HI> HIGH-PRIEST.—54. <HI>Then took they him and
led him, and brought him to the</HI> HIGH-PRIEST'S <HI>house.</HI></P>
<P>2. IT is likely, that the power which the <HI>jewish</HI> peo∣ple
were possessed of under the <HI>Romans</HI> was lodged chiefly
in the hands of two persons: and it may be supposed,
the <HI>Jews</HI> chose to have it so. When they had resolved
upon the War with the <HI>Romans, Josephus</HI> says: “They
assembled in the temple, and appointed several Gene∣rals.
And <HI>Joseph</HI> the Son of <HI>Gorion,</HI> and the High∣Priest
<HI>Ananus</HI> were chosen to be supreme gover∣nours
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. 2. c. 20. §. 3.</NOTE> of all things in the City.” I have not ob∣served
this passage quoted by any upon this occasion:
Whether it be material or not, the reader will judge.
But it has inclined me to suppose, that about this time
there were usually among the <HI>Jews</HI> two persons, to
whom the government was chiefly committed. I must
however advertise the reader, that <HI>Ananus,</HI> here called
High-Priest, was not then in the office of the Priest∣hood.</P>
<P>3. SINCE <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now properly High-Priest,
and <HI>Annas</HI> had been so: if the latter was now in some
post of authority, they might be both said very pro∣perly
to be High-Priests at this time. <HI>Josephus</HI> often
call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius</HI> Presidents or Governours
of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ant. l. 16. c. x. p. 741. v. 1, 2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ib. c. ix. p. 734. v. 25. &amp; 37.</NOTE>
though <HI>Saturninus</HI> only was President,
<PB N="508" REF="526"/>
and <HI>Voluminius</HI> the Emperour's Procurator, that is, the
officer that took care of the revenue.</P>
<P>THERE happened a disturbance between the <HI>Jews</HI>
and the <HI>Samaritans</HI> in the reign of <HI>Claudius. Cumanus</HI>
the Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> was not able to compose it:
appeals were made to <HI>Quadratus</HI> President of <HI>Syria.</HI> He
having punished several “sent two others of the most
powerful men of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as also THE HIGH PRIESTS
<HI>Jonathan</HI> and <HI>Ananias,</HI> and <HI>Ananus</HI> the son of this last
mentioned person, and some other considerable men
to <HI>Cesar</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell, lib. ii cap. xii. §. 6.</NOTE>.” I take this passage of <HI>Josephus</HI> (which
has been often cited by learned men) to be very near
parallel with St. <HI>Luke's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JONATHAN</HI> had been High-Priest, but had
been put out long before now by <HI>Vitellius</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ant. 18. c. 6. §. 3.</NOTE>: <HI>Ananias</HI>
was<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ib. 20. cap. 4. p. 886. V. 41.</NOTE> now High-Priest. In like manner, in the case
in question, <HI>Annas</HI> had formerly been High-Priest, but
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now in that office.</P>
<P>I AM the more inclined to think, <HI>Josephus's</HI> stile here
parallel with St. <HI>Luke's;</HI> because it appears from ano∣ther
place, where <HI>Josephus</HI> mentions this affair, that
<HI>Ananus,</HI> the third person named, was then Captain of
the Temple<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ant. 20. c. 5. p. 889. v. 36.</NOTE>. From whence I conclude, that the
Three persons here mentioned were then in the three
chief posts of the <HI>jewish</HI> civil and sacred Government.
He speaks indeed of two others, whom he calls the <HI>most
powerful of the Jews.</HI> But I apprehend they were so
only in respect of their influence. It is reasonable to
suppose, that the persons named were in the most emi∣nent
stations.</P>
<P>THERE is another particular, in which these two
passages are parallel: <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who had been High∣Priest,
is named before <HI>Ananias,</HI> then in office: The
two names stand in the same order in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> I sup∣pose,
<PB N="509" REF="527"/>
that these propositions may afford a clear solution
of this difficulty.</P>
<P>THE learned <HI>Selden</HI> conjectures, that <HI>Annas</HI> and
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> are not mentioned in this place by St. <HI>Luke</HI> on
account of any <HI>sacred</HI> function they discharged, but as
they were the two persons who had then the chief autho∣rity
under the <HI>Romans</HI> in the <HI>Civil</HI> administration of the
<HI>jewish</HI> affairs: that <HI>Annas</HI> was now Prince of the <HI>San∣hedrim,</HI>
and <HI>Caiaphas</HI> the father of it; and that there∣fores
<HI>Annas</HI> is first named, as being in the more honou∣rable
station of the civil government. He supposes
that these two posts might then be annual, that <HI>Annas</HI>
was Prince of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> when <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> be∣gan
his ministry, and that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was Prince when
our Saviour was crucified. And therefore St. <HI>John</HI> says
particularly, that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was High-Priest <HI>that same
year,</HI> John xi. 49, 51. But that afterwards when <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>John</HI> were called before the council, <HI>Annas,</HI> who
is first named, [<HI>Acts</HI> iv. 6.] was <HI>Prince,</HI> and <HI>Caiaphas,
Father</HI> of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hinc, si conjecturae venia detur, existimarim, Annam &amp; Caia∣pham Pontifices simul a D.

<P><HI>SELDEN</HI> offers these thoughts, as conjectures
only. I hope therefore, it will not be deemed pre∣sumption,
<PB N="510" REF="528"/>
to be of another mind, or to offer some dif∣ferent
thoughts upon this subject.</P>
<P>As <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now in the office of the Priest∣hood,
when <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> began his ministry; I
suppose that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> is mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> on the
account of the High Priesthood, and the civil autho∣rity
joined with it; and that, the <HI>Jewish</HI> government
being at this time under the <HI>Romans Aristocratical, An∣nas</HI>
is mentioned together with <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> as being the
other chief person in the <HI>jewish</HI> administration. But I
am of opinion, that we have not sufficient light at pre∣sent
to determine, what Post of honour <HI>Annas</HI> was in,
though that of Prince of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> be as likely as
any. However, I cannot easily perswade my self, that
during the <HI>Jews</HI> subjection to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Prince
of the Sanhedrim, or any other <HI>Jew,</HI> not in the High
Priesthood, was equal, much less superior to him who
enjoyed that office; unless, when there was some <HI>jewish</HI>
Prince appointed Governour of the temple by the Ro∣man
Emperour. If <HI>Josephus's</HI> authority be sufficient
to decide this matter, it is plain the High-Priest had
the chief power in the <HI>jewish</HI> nation under the <HI>Romans.</HI>
This may be concluded from hence, that he has pre∣served
the succession of the High-Priests, and of them
only, to the destruction of the temple. But if there
had been after the removal of <HI>Archelaus</HI> any persons in
an office of superior authority to the High-Priest, he
would have also given us their names. We should also
in all probability have met with some accounts in his hi∣story,
of the putting out of these officers by the Ro∣man
Governours, when they did not behave to satisfac∣tion.
And indeed <HI>Josephus</HI> seems to me expresly to
say, that the High-Priest was the chief person in the
<HI>jewish</HI> nation under the <HI>Romans.</HI> Having at the con∣clusion
of his Antiquities reckoned up the <HI>Jewish</HI> High∣Priests
he says: “Some of these administred affairs
under <HI>Herod</HI> the King, and his Son <HI>Archelaus:</HI> after
their death, the administration was <HI>Aristocratical,</HI> but
<PB N="511" REF="529"/>
the Presidentship of the nation was committed to the
High-Priests<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Joseph. Antiq. xx. c. 9. fin.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>FARTHER, I apprehend no mystery at all in the
order in which these two persons are named by St. <HI>Luke.</HI>
Ancient writers seem not to be very solicitous about the
order in which they name persons who are near equal<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Thus <HI>Herodotus</HI> says, that <HI>Cambyses</HI> was the son of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Cassandana:</HI> and presently after, that he was son of this woman and Cyrus. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Euterp. init. <HI>Josephus</HI> says, <HI>Herod</HI> had two Sons by a <HI>Samaritan</HI> woman, namely, <HI>Antipas</HI> and <HI>Archelaus.</HI> Soon after, <HI>Archelaus</HI> is mentioned first, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 17. c. 1. §. 3. <HI>Josephus says</HI> again, that <HI>Herod</HI> called to the Council at <HI>Berytum Salome</HI> and <HI>Pheroras, De Bell.</HI> l. 1. c. 27. §. 3. Afterwards <HI>Tero</HI> the old Soldier complains to <HI>Herod,</HI> that he hearkened to <HI>Pheroras</HI> and <HI>Salome</HI> against his own sons, <HI>ib.</HI> §. 4.</NOTE>.
I suppose that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was at this time chief in digni∣ty
and authority in the government: But that neverthe∣lesse,
there is no absurdity or impropriety in naming
<HI>Annas</HI> first, inasmuch as he was father-in-law to <HI>Caia∣phas,</HI>
and was past the Priesthood.</P>
<P>§. II. <HI>IT will perhaps be expected I should here say
somewhat to a text of St.</HI> John, <HI>which has a relation
to this matter, and which does appear at first to be a
very difficult place.</HI> And one of them named Caiaphas,
being <HI>HIGH-PRIEST THAT</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>SAME YEAR,</HI> said unto
them, ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expe∣dient
for us, that one man should die for the people, and
that the whole nation perish not. And this spake he, not of
himself: but being<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>HIGH-PRIEST THAT YEAR, HE
PROPHESIED</HI> that Jesus should die for that nation: and
not for that nation only, but that also he should gather to∣gether
in one the children of God that were scattered
abroad, <HI>John</HI> xi. 49,—52.</P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="530"/>
THERE are here two things which need to be ex∣plained;
<HI>first,</HI> Why <HI>Caiaphas</HI> is said to be High-Priest
<HI>that same year:</HI> And <HI>secondly,</HI> What is meant by his
<HI>prophesying,</HI> being <HI>High-Priest.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have thought that the phrase, <HI>being High∣Priest
that year,</HI> implies that St. <HI>John</HI> supposed the
High Priesthood was annual. And upon this account
they have been willing to charge him with a great mi∣stake.
For <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was Governour of <HI>Judea</HI> ten
years, and <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was put into the Priesthood by
<HI>Valerius Gratus, Pilate's</HI> Predecessor; and continued in
it, till after <HI>Pilate's</HI> removal. <HI>Selden</HI> thought that by
High-Priest is meant the chief man of that nation, and
particularly the Prince of the Sanhedrim, which post
might be at that time annual. For my own part, I
think, <HI>that year</HI> (as it ought to have been rendered, and
as the same phrase is render'd <HI>ver.</HI> 51, and not <HI>that
same year</HI>) denotes no more than at <HI>that time.</HI> It is
very common to put <HI>years</HI> and <HI>days</HI> in the plural num∣ber,
for time. <HI>After many</HI> DAYS <HI>thou shalt be visited:
In the latter</HI> YEARS <HI>thou shalt come into the land that is
brought back from the sword,</HI> &amp;c. Ezek. xxxviii. 8. <HI>Then
shall the offerings of Judah be pleasant unto the Lord, as in
the</HI> DAYS <HI>of old, and as in the former</HI> YEARS, <HI>Mal.</HI> iii.
4. There are other texts perhaps more apposite to our
purpose. <HI>And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in</HI>
THOSE DAYS, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvi. 3. <HI>And he shall dwell in that
City, until the death of the high priest that shall be in</HI>
THOSE DAYS, <HI>Josh.</HI> xx. 6. <HI>Philo</HI> uses the word <HI>day,</HI> in
the singular number, in the same manner: Speaking
of the trial of Jealousy, he says, the man and the wo∣man
shall go up to the temple, “and the man standing
before the altar shall declare the cause of his jealousy
in the presence of him who is Priest at that<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Legibus special. p. 785. C.</NOTE> day.”
All that St. <HI>John</HI> says therefore is, that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was
High-Priest at that time, or the High-Priest of that
<PB N="513" REF="531"/>
time. And if we ought to suppose any thing emphati∣cal
in the expression, (which yet I cannot see) I appre∣hend
it arises from the distance between the time of the
event and the writing. St. <HI>John</HI> writing his Gospel a
considerable time after the crucifixion of Jesus, when
many might be supposed to be ignorant who was then
High-Priest; and there having been under the <HI>Romans</HI>
frequent removals made in that office; it was natural
enough for him to expresse this circumstance with some
peculiar emphasis, or to mention it more than once.</P>
<P>THE other difficulty to be considered lies in the
words: <HI>Being High-Priest that year he prophesyed.</HI> Here
I cannot perceive the sense of this observation, suppo∣sing
with <HI>Selden,</HI> High-Priest to stand for Prince of the
Sanhedrim. By <HI>prophesying</HI> I understand in this place,
declaring the event; which it was in a peculiar man∣ner
the office of the Priest to do, when he was enquired
of, or when God was enquired of<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the <HI>PRIEST</HI> the son of Ahitub.—And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse,—and hast <HI>ENQUIRED</HI> of God for him? 1 Sam. xxii. 11—13. And David said to Abiathar the <HI>PRIEST.</HI> Bring hither the Ephod. Then said David, O Lord God of Israel,—Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Soul come down, as thy servant hath heard?—And the Lord said be will come down, 1 Sam. xxiii. 10—12. And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor <HI>BY URIM,</HI> nor by prophets, ch. xxviii. 6.</NOTE> by him concern∣ing
any important matters under deliberation. Thus
<HI>Josephus</HI> says: “But the <HI>Philistines,</HI> when they heard
that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> had made <HI>David</HI> King, brought
forth their army against him.—But the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 7. c. 4. §. 1.</NOTE> King of
the <HI>Jews</HI> (for he allowed not himself to do any thing
without prophesy, and the command of God, and as∣surance
of the event from him) required the High-Priest
<PB N="514" REF="532"/>
to foretell him, what was the will of God, and
what would be the issue of the battle. When he had
prophesied victory and power, he led out his forces
against the <HI>Philistines.</HI>” And presently after: “The
King<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid.</NOTE> of the <HI>Israelites</HI> enquiring again of God,
concerning the event of the battle, the High-Priest
prophesyed”, that he should do so and so, and then
would have a sure and easy victory: referring to the
story told, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> v. 22—25.</P>
<P>LET us now apply these remarks in a general para∣phrase
of this text of St. <HI>John.</HI> Some of the council,
of a different opinion from those whose words are re∣corded,
<HI>ver.</HI> 48, having, as may be supposed, from
considerations taken from the dispositions of the peo∣ple,
the temper of the Roman Governour, and other
circumstances of their affairs, expressed some doubts
about the successe of a prosecution of Jesus, and the
consequences of taking away his life: “<HI>Caiaphas,</HI> who
was the High-Priest at that time, when it came to
his turn to deliver his opinion, said: You have hither∣to
talked very weakly and ignorantly: You may pro∣ceed
in the case before you without hesitation. The
taking<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> away the life of this man will be so far from
being ruinous to the whole nation in this country and
in other parts, as some of you fear, that it will be
much for the advantage of the people of God every
where. This however he said, not merely of himself:
but being then High-Priest, he foretold the issue and
event of their counsels and of the death of Jesus: And
that it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> would come to passe that Jesus would die
for that nation, and not for that nation only, but
that through his death he would also gather together
in one the children of God which were scattered
abroad.”</P>

we hear no more of <HI>Herod,</HI> till we have the account of

<P>HERE then lies our difficulty. The Evangelists
call <HI>Herodias</HI>'s first husband <HI>Philip.</HI> It is objected,
that they must mean <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch. But it is
plain from <HI>Josephus,</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch was not
her first husband, but <HI>Herod,</HI> son of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great
by <HI>Mariamne</HI> the High-Priest's daughter.</P>
<P>IN answer to this: 1. It has been said by some, that
<HI>Josephus</HI> was mistaken. Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Nulla ergo excusatio Josepho pararl potest.

whom I have often quoted, is fully perswaded, that <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI>
Tetrarch of <HI>Iturea</HI> and <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> was <HI>Herodias</HI>'s
first husband. Beside that the Evangelists lived nearer the
time of the event than <HI>Josephus,</HI> he says, they had more
reason to be well informed in this matter than <HI>Josephus,</HI>
and they are three to one. Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI> does not deny,
<HI>Herod's,</HI> having had a son of his own name by the High-Priest's
daughter: but he says, this son died before his
father. And he thinks, that <HI>Josephus</HI> says as much,
and has allured us that after <HI>Antipater</HI> was dead, <HI>Herod</HI>
had no sons lef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, beside <HI>Archelaus, Herod Antipas,</HI> and
<HI>Philip,</HI> betwixt whom he divided his Kingdome. And
therefore <HI>Josephus</HI> is guilty of a mod flagrant self-con∣tradiction in making the son of the High-Priest's
<PB N="518" REF="536"/>
daughter, <HI>Herodias's</HI> husband. Besides there is no men∣tion
of this son in <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's last will; which
would be very strange, if he was then alive, especially
considering that <HI>Herod</HI> left his sister <HI>Salome</HI> a very good estate in land.</P>
<P>THIS is Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI>'s solution: but, in my opini∣on,
a very poor one. I will not be positive, that <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
has made no mistake in the accounts of <HI>Herod's</HI> fa∣mily:
because where a man has issue by seven or eight
wives, as <HI>Herod</HI> had, perhaps a writer had need to
have a head peculiarly turned for genealogy to be se∣cure
from all errors in giving an account of his chil∣dren
and all their marriages, especially considering
how much the<NOTE N="D" PLACE="foot">Beside <HI>Herodias,</HI> her three nieces, daughters of her brother <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> would employ the attention of an Historian. <HI>Bir∣nice,</HI> the eldest, after the death of her full husband <HI>Herod</HI> King of <HI>Chalcis.</HI> married <HI>Polemon</HI> King of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> [or as some read it <HI>Lycia</HI>]. “But this marriage lasted not long, for <HI>Bernice</HI> left <HI>Polemon.”</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

It may be inferred from hence, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> women, as well as the men, did then practise Divorces, and after that marry to others. These instances from <HI>Josephus</HI> confirm the inference. We may be assured these Ladies were not singular. Their examples would be followed by others: and, it is likely, were supported by many precedents. If the women took this licence, what would not the men do! Our Historian <HI>Josephus</HI> affords us a double example of this practice. His first wife left him, <HI>vit.</HI> § 75. And he married another.

the task in a short time by leaving or divorcing
their husbands. But I can never perswade myself, that
<HI>Josephus,</HI> a professed writer of <HI>Jewish</HI> history, could be
guilty of so many mistakes, as are included in a mi∣stake
about <HI>Herodias's</HI> first husband. If he was not
furnished with the events of all <HI>Herod's</HI> children, yet
he must certainly know the marriages of the last prin∣ces
in the land of <HI>Israel,</HI> his own country. Could he
be ignorant, who was <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch's wife? who
was the first husband of <HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch's second
wife, and of <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Great's sister? Was not <HI>He∣rodias</HI>'s
leaving her first husband in all respects a most
notorious action? Was not <HI>Josepbus</HI> well acquainted
with her nephew, <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger?</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Basnage</HI> says, <HI>Josephus</HI> has assured us, <HI>Herod</HI>
had but three sons left after the death of <HI>Antipater.</HI> I
think, <HI>Josephus</HI> has never said any such thing. If he
had, he would be a writer of no weight; since he has
afterwards expresly said, that <HI>Herodias's</HI> first husband
was <HI>Herod</HI> the son of the High-Priest's daughter. And
if <HI>Josephus</HI> had assured us, <HI>Herod</HI> the Great had but
three sons left after <HI>Antipater</HI> was dead, Mr. <HI>Basnage</HI>
might have spared his arguments from the omission of
<HI>Herod</HI> the High-Priest's daughters son, and the large
estate left to <HI>Salome</HI> in <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's last will.</P>
<P>INDEED, there is no reason to conclude that <HI>Herod,</HI>
son of the High-Priest's daughter, died before his fa∣ther:
but a great deal of reason to suppose he survived
him, beside the expresse mention made of him long
afterwards, as the husband of <HI>Herodias.</HI> For in the will
his father made after the enquiries into <HI>Antipater's</HI> con∣spiracy,
and therefore in the last year of his life, this
said <HI>Herod's</HI> succession was struck out, as <HI>Josephus</HI> ex∣presly says<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 459.</NOTE> And though there be no mention made
in the account of <HI>Herod's</HI> last will, of any other sons

should leave no towns or Lordships to this son
(though living) in his last will, since his mother had
been lately detected in a great crime. Nay, it is not
strange, that three sons only of <HI>Herod</HI> had Tetrarchies,
and the rest, though never so many, only sums of mo∣ney
or revenues. As for the towns bequeathed by
<HI>Herod</HI> to his sister <HI>Salome;</HI> she had been always faithful
to him, and it was sit she should have some extraordi∣nary
testimony of his affection. <HI>Josephus</HI> himself<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 17. c. vi. §. 1.</NOTE>
assigns this as the reason of that regard shewed to her
in <HI>Herod's</HI> wills.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Philo</HI> says, that when <HI>Pilate</HI> dedicated shields,
and placed them in <HI>Herod's</HI> palace at <HI>Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Philo de legat. in Cai. p. 1034. A.</NOTE> the
<HI>Jews</HI> got four<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> id. ibid.</NOTE> of the King's sons, and other his
descendents to make use of their interest with <HI>Pilate</HI> to
remove the shields. If <HI>Philo</HI> may be relied upon in this
matter, and if we may understand the word <HI>sons</HI> in the
most proper sense, (which it seems most reasonable to
do) and not for grandchildren or other descendents;
then <HI>Herod</HI> must have left behind him at left two sons, be∣side
the three betwixt whom he divided his dominions:
For <HI>Archelaus</HI> certainly was not one of the <HI>four</HI> sons
whom <HI>Philo</HI> speaks of, because he had been banished
into <HI>Gaul</HI> long before <HI>Pilate's</HI> government. Supposing
then, that <HI>Herod</HI> Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> Te∣trarch
of <HI>Trachonitis</HI> were two of the four, there must
have been two other sons of <HI>Herod,</HI> beside them and
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="539"/>
BUT however <HI>Philo</HI> ought to be understood, I can0
never think it a fair way of getting rid of this difficulty
to charge <HI>Josephus</HI> with a great many gross blunders.</P>
<P>2. I PROCEED thefore to lay before the reader ano∣ther
solution, which has been in the main approved of
already by many learned men.</P>
<P>(1.) THE Evangelists and <HI>Josephus</HI> are in the right,
and none of them have committed any mistake in this
matter. I have just stiewn, that there is no reason to
think <HI>Josephus</HI> was mistaken. And it is as unreasona∣ble
to suppose, that the Evangelists are mistaken. They
all agree in calling <HI>Herodias</HI>'s first husband <HI>Philip.</HI> And
they appear to befully master of the history of <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great's family. One or other of them have told us, that
<HI>Archelaus</HI> suceeeded his father in <HI>Judea;</HI> that <HI>Herod</HI> (who
was also called <HI>Antipas</HI>) was Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee, Philip</HI>
of <HI>Trachonitis.</HI> If they had not been well informed,
some errors would have appeared here. St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
given the proper titles and characters to all the other
descendents of <HI>Herod,</HI> whom he has mentioned after∣wards
<HI>; Herod</HI> the King, <HI>Agrippa, Bernice, Drusilla.</HI></P>
<P>THEY speak of this unlawful marriage of <HI>Herodias,</HI>
as a matter they were well acquainted with; and <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
concurs with them in the main.</P>
<P>(2.) THE Evangelists do not intend <HI>Philip</HI> the Te∣trarch,
but the same person that <HI>Josephus</HI> does. If they
had intended <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch when they speak of
<HI>Herodias's</HI> husband, they would have given him his ti∣tle.
This is their constant method. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> says,
that Jesus was born <HI>in the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king,</HI> Matt.
ii. 1. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that the vision of <HI>Zacharias</HI> was <HI>in
the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king of</HI> Judea, <HI>Luke</HI> i. 5. In the
account of our Saviour's return from <HI>Egypt</HI> St. <HI>Mat∣thew</HI>
says, that <HI>Joseph</HI> heard that <HI>Archelaus</HI> did reign,
in <HI>Judea, in the room of his father</HI> Herod, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 22.
St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives the proper titles to all the princes whom
he mentions at the beginning of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s mi∣nistry.
In the account of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s sending our Saviour
to <HI>Herod</HI> it appears plainly, that he was the Tetrarch
<PB N="522" REF="540"/>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> to whom he was sent, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 6—8.
When St. <HI>Luke</HI> begins the history of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> he
calls him <HI>the king,</HI> Acts xii. 1. He gives also the title
of <HI>King</HI> to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> Acts xxv. 13.</P>
<P>INDEED the church at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in their prayer to
God give <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> no titles, Act iv.
27. And I believe, none would have them there at
length. In the account of the death of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap∣tist,</HI>
and of this marriage, all the Evangelists do ever
give <HI>Herod</HI> his title: <HI>Matt.</HI> xiv. 1. <HI>Mark</HI> vi. 14. <HI>Luke</HI>
iii. 19, ix. 7. But not one of them have given the
<HI>Philip</HI> whom they mention any title; but that <HI>Herod
had laid hold of</HI> John, <HI>and put him in prison for</HI> Hero∣dias
<HI>sake, his brother</HI> Philip'<HI>s wife,</HI> Matth. xiv. 3. or
bound him in prison <HI>for</HI> Herodias <HI>sake, his brother</HI> Phi∣lip's
<HI>wife, Mark</HI> vi. 17. Again: Herod <HI>the Tetrarch
being reproved by him for</HI> Herodias <HI>his brother</HI> Philip's
<HI>wife,</HI> Luke iii. 19. I make no doubt therefore but
that <HI>Philip, Herodia's</HI> first husband, was a private per∣son,
who lived in all probability at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and
that <HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch in his way to <HI>Rome</HI> there fell
in love with her, and made the contract. <HI>Philip</HI> then,
whom the Evangelists speak of, as the first husband of
<HI>Herodias,</HI> was a private person, inverted with no titles
or dignities: so is <HI>Josephus's Herod,</HI> as appears from the
history I have given of him. And it is not unlikely,
that this was one reason, among others, why <HI>Herod</HI>
the Tetrarch's proposal of marriage was so soon ac∣cepted
by <HI>Herodias,</HI> an ambitious woman.</P>
<P>THE only difficulty therefore concerning this mat∣ter
arises from the name. <HI>Josephus</HI> calls this person
<HI>Herod,</HI> the Evangelists <HI>Philip:</HI> Moreover <HI>Philip</HI> was
the name of the Tetrarch of <HI>Iturea</HI> and <HI>Trachonitis;</HI>
therefore it may be thought strange, that <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great should have another son called <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>THIS difficulty will be cleared by the following
considerations. It is not at all strange, that <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great should have two sons called by the same name,
when he had children by seven or eight wives. Even
<PB N="523" REF="541"/>
according to <HI>Josephus,</HI> the eldest son was called <HI>Antipa∣ter,</HI>
and another, who was the youngest, <HI>Antipas</HI> or
<HI>Herod Antipas,</HI> the Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee.</HI> These are but
one and the same name, only a different termination.
<HI>Josephus</HI> mentions three of <HI>Herod</HI>'s sons of the name of
<HI>Herod,</HI> without any addition<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jos. Ant. l. 17. c. 1. l. 18. c. 6. §. 4. De Bell. l. 1. c. xxviii. &amp; Geneal. Herod. in Reland. Palest. Illustr.</NOTE>. But yet it is highly
probable, they had some other names by which they
were distinguished, though <HI>Josephus</HI> has not mentioned
them. <HI>Grotius</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Matth.</HI> xix. 3.</NOTE> thinks it very probable, there was
a <HI>Philip</HI> among the ancestors of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, after
whom two of his sons were named <HI>Philip:</HI> as there were
two of them, who bore the name of <HI>Antipater</HI> or <HI>An∣tipas</HI>
from his father.</P>
<P>THOUGH there was another brother by the same fa∣ther,
namely <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch, called by the same
name with <HI>Herodias</HI>'s husband; yet it was not necessary
for the Evangelists to take notice of it. When writers
relate a well known fact, near the time in which it hap∣pened,
whilst there is no danger of persons making a mis∣take,
this precaution is often neglected. <HI>Dio</HI>'s account
of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal is thus: “<HI>Herod</HI> of <HI>Palestine</HI> be∣ing
accused by his brothers was banished to the other
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>lib. 55. p. 767. B.</NOTE> side the <HI>Alps.” Herod</HI> was the name by which the
Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> was usually called. And he also
was afterwards banished to the other side the <HI>Alps.</HI> Yet
I believe, no one ever charged <HI>Dio</HI> with a mistake here
as to the person he speaks of, or suspected, that he
thought the Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> was banished from his
dominions A. U. 759. I will transcribe here an ob∣servation
of the learned and judicious Dr.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Conn. Part II. year before Christ 81. p. 396.</NOTE> <HI>Prideaux.</HI>
“He <HI>[Ptolemy Lathyrus]</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Cleopatra</HI>
his daughter, and only legitimate child. Her pro∣per
name was <HI>Berenice,</HI> and so <HI>Pausanias</HI> calls her.
For it is to be noted, that as all the Males of this fa∣mily
had the common name of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> so all the
<PB N="524" REF="542"/>
females of it had the name of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and besides
had other proper names to distinguish them from each
other. Thus <HI>Selene</HI> was called <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and so were
also two other of her sisters. And in like manner,
this daughter of <HI>Lathyrus,</HI> whose proper name was
<HI>Berenice</HI> bore also that of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> according to the
usage of her family. The observing of this will re∣move
many obscurities and difficulties in the <HI>Egyptian</HI>
History.”</P>
<P>THE Evangelists do all agree in calling <HI>Herodias</HI>'s
first husband <HI>Philip:</HI> and they appear fully masters of
their story. It is therefore highly reasonable to sup∣pose,
he was called <HI>Philip</HI> as well as <HI>Herod.</HI> I shall put
a case resembling this. <HI>Josephus</HI> always calls <HI>Livia,
Augustus</HI>'s wife<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jos. p. 1028. not. h.</NOTE>, Julia; though that was the proper
name of <HI>Augustus</HI>'s daughter, without ever giving the
lest hint of his reason for it. It is true, that though
the Roman historians do generally call her <HI>Livia;</HI> yet
they have told us, that she had also the name of <HI>Julia,</HI>
and have informed us of the reason of it; which was,
that <HI>Augustus</HI> in his last will adopted his wife into the
<HI>Julian</HI> family, and appointed that she should bear the
name of <HI>Julia</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Tiberium &amp; Liviam heredes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>abuit. Livia in familiam Juliam nomen{que} Augustae adsumebatur. Ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it. lib. i. c. 8. vid. &amp; Sueton. Aug. c. 101. Dion. p. 600. A.</NOTE>. And there are medals, on which
she bears this name. But if nothing of this had ap∣peared
in any of the Roman authors, or inscriptions that
are extant; yet since <HI>Josephus</HI> appears to be well ac∣quainted
with the Roman affairs from <HI>Julius Cesar</HI>
down to his own time, I believe most men would have
allowed that he had some good reason for calling the
wife of <HI>Augustus, Julia.</HI> For the same reason a like
supposition ought to be made in behalf of the Evange∣lists
in the case before us.</P>
<P>IT was exceeding common among the ancients, <HI>Jews</HI>
and others, for persons to have two names, and to be
called sometimes by the one, and sometimes by the
other. There are several instances in the <HI>New Testa∣ment.</HI>
<PB N="525" REF="543"/>
Simon, <HI>who is called</HI> Peter; Lebbeus, <HI>whose sur∣name
was</HI> Thaddeus, <HI>Matth.</HI> x. 2, 3. Thomas, <HI>which
is called</HI> Dydimus. <HI>John</HI> xi. 16. Simeon, <HI>that was called</HI>
Niger, <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1. Saul, <HI>who was also called</HI> Paul.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> calls <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> the High Priest,
<HI>Joseph.</HI> He has indeed told us that he was also called
<HI>Caiaphas</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P. 795. v. 23. 802. v, 28.</NOTE>. If mankind would have been as equita∣ble
to the writers of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> as they usually
are to other authors, to some who are far from giving
equal tokens of skill or probity with them; this, would
have created no difficulty, though <HI>Josephus</HI> had never
subjoined the name of <HI>Caiaphas</HI> to that of <HI>Joseph.</HI> But
if any had been disposed to give the Evangelists unfair
and unequal treatment, it is likely, they would have
pretended that here was a notorious blunder; and that
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> was so far from being High-Priest, when <HI>John
Baptist</HI> began his ministry, and when Jesus was crucifi∣ed,
that there never was any such person High-Priest
among the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>I HOPE what is already said may be sufficient to
convince all reasonable men, there is no just ground to
suspect the Evangelists of any mistake in the name of
<HI>Herodias</HI>'s first husband. However, there is somewhat
farther to be offered. There are other writings extant,
in which he is called <HI>Philip.</HI> I shall transcribe here the
account of it in Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s words. “<HI>Gorionides</HI> saith,
<HI>Herodias</HI> was first married to <HI>Philip,</HI> and then taken
away from him by <HI>Herod Antipas.</HI> The old <HI>Hebrew</HI>
chronicle saith, <HI>Uxorem fratris sui Philippi ipso vivente

an old <HI>Chronicle</HI> of the second Temple saith, <HI>Antipas

of his brother <HI>Philip,</HI> he being yet living, and having

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Zacharias the Son of Barachias.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are some difficulties attending
the prophetical representation, given by
our Lord, of those judgements which he
foresaw, would soon befall the <HI>Jewish</HI> na∣tion.
This we have in two of the Evan∣gelists;
in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke.</HI>
One account will illustrate the other, and we may have
some occasion to refer to each of them: therefore I
shall set them both down here at once.</P>
<P><HI>The account of this matter, as it stands in St.</HI> Mat∣thew,
<HI>is thus:</HI> Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypo∣crites,
because ye build the tombs of the Prophets, and gar∣nish
the sepulchres of the righteous; and say, if we had been
in the days of our fathers, we would not have been par∣takers
with them in the blood of the Prophets. Wherefore
ye be witnesses unto your selves, that ye be the children of
them that killed the Prophets. Fill ye up then the measure
of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how
can ye escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore, behold,
I send unto you Prophets, and wise men and scribes, and
some of them ye shall kill and crucifie, and some of them sball
ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city
to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed
upon the earth, from the blood of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> unto the
blood of <HI>ZACHARIAS, SON OF BARACHIAS,</HI> whom ye
slew between the temple and the altar. Verily, I say un∣to
you, all these things shall come upon this generation,
<HI>Matth. xxiii.</HI> 29—36.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="545"/>
<HI>THE parallel place in St.</HI> Luke <HI>is in these words:</HI>
Wo unto you, for you build the sepulchres of the Prophets,
and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witness that
ye allow the deeds of your fathers, for they indeed killed
them, and ye build their sepulchres. Therefore also said
the wisdom of God, I will send them Prophets and Apo∣stles,
and some of them they shall slay and persecute; that
the blood of all the Prophets, which was shed from the
foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
from the blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> unto the <HI>BLOOD OF ZACHARIAS,</HI>
which perished between the altar and the temple: verily,
I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation,
<HI>Luke xi.</HI> 47—51.</P>
<P>HERE the Evangelists may be charged with a mis∣take
several ways. They who would suppose, that the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> here referred to is <HI>Zacharias,</HI> one of the twelve
lesser <HI>Jewish</HI> prophets, will say, they must have been
mistaken, because in the time of this <HI>Zacharias,</HI> the
temple is supposed to have been in ruins: and therefore
it is impossible he should have been killed <HI>between the
temple and the altar.</HI> And others, who suppose the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> here intended, is the <HI>Zacharias,</HI> whose death
is related in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxiv. may say, that St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
mistook the name of his father. For his name was <HI>Jeho∣jada,</HI>
and not <HI>Barachias.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another <HI>Zacharias,</HI> whose death is related
by <HI>Josephus.</HI> But that happened not till long after the
time, in which our Saviour is supposed to have spoken
these words. This seems to afford the most formidable
objection. I shall therefore state and consider it parti∣cularly.
And in answering this I hope to answer also
the other two.</P>
<P>BEFORE I state this objection, I shall here transcribe
the passage <HI>of Josephus,</HI> on which it is founded. I must
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridge it indeed, but I shall omit nothing that is ma∣terial
to the point before us.</P>
<P>“THE zealots, <HI>says Josephus,</HI> were exceedingly en∣raged against <HI>Zacharias</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, the son of <HI>Baruch:</HI> for
<PB N="528" REF="546"/>
he was a man who detested all wickednesse, was a
lover of liberty, and moreover was very rich. They
call<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> together therefore by a decree seventy of the
chief of the people, and form a kind of Council de∣stitute
of all authority. They then brought <HI>Zacha∣rias</HI>
before them, and accused him of a conspiracy
with the <HI>Romans:</HI> and in particular charged him
with sending messengers to <HI>Vespasian,</HI> the better to
concert measures for betraying them into his hands.”
But they had no witnesses. The facts were not proved.
<HI>Zacharias</HI> in a speech he delivered before the Council
confuted all the calumnies of the <HI>zealots,</HI> and warmly re∣proved
them for their wickednesse. “The seventy then
acquitted him, choosing rather to die with him, than
to bring upon themselves the imputation of his death.
He being thus absolved, the zealots raised a loud
clamour against those Judges, as not understanding
the design for which they had been invested with au∣thority.
And two of the most daring of the zea∣lots,
falling upon <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the middle of the
Temple, slew him there<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. l. 4. c. 5. §. 4.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT maybe said then: From hence it appears, that
the writers of these books were not acquainted with the
affairs of those times. These writings therefore do not
come from St. <HI>Matthew</HI> or St. <HI>Luke.</HI> At lest the authors
of them did not live at the time they are supposed to
have lived: possibly not till long afterwards. How
else could they have committed such a blunder, as to
make Jesus tell the <HI>Jews</HI> of his time, in the reign of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> that they had killed <HI>Zacharias</HI> the son of <HI>Ba∣rachias,</HI>
or <HI>Baruch?</HI> when <HI>Josephus</HI> informs us, that he
was not killed till the latter end of <HI>Nero's</HI> reign, above
thirty years after these words are said to have been spo∣ken
by Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="529" REF="547"/>
I. To this I answer, in the <HI>first</HI> place, that the fact
related by <HI>Josephus</HI> does not suit the words of Christ in
the Evangelists.</P>
<P>FOR (1.) the name of the father of <HI>Zacharias</HI> seems
to be different. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">On <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiii. 35.</NOTE> observes “that as <HI>Ba∣ruch</HI>
in <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> is always called
by the Septuagint <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Baruch)</HI> so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Bara∣chiah)</HI>
is rendered by them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Barachiah)
Isa.</HI> viii. 2. <HI>Zach.</HI> i. 1. 7. And in Neh. iii. we find
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Barachias) v.</HI> 4, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>(Baruch) v.</HI> 20.
which shows they were not the same name.”</P>
<P>(2.) THEIR characters are not the same. The de∣sign
of our Saviour's discourse obliges us to suppose,
that the <HI>Zacharias</HI> he mentioned was a <HI>prophet:</HI> Where∣as
the <HI>Zacharias</HI> in <HI>Josephus</HI> has not that character from
him.</P>
<P>(3.) THE place, in which they are said to have
been slain, is not the same. The <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the go∣spels
perished <HI>between the temple and the altar,</HI> according
to both St. <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Luke.</HI> But there is no
reason to suppose, that <HI>Josephus</HI>'s <HI>Zacharias</HI> was slain
in the inner court, in which the altar stood. The
council was not held within that court: and <HI>Zacharias</HI>
seems to have been slain immediately after his absolu∣tion
by the council. If he was slain in any part of the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> temple, that is perfectly agreeable to the
words of <HI>Josephus;</HI> for under that name were com∣prehended
the temple and all the courts and buildings
belonging to it.</P>
<P>THESE several instances of disagreement, I should
think, must incline most persons to conclude, that the
same <HI>Zacharias</HI> was not intended by the Evangelists
and <HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT perhaps this is more than is reasonable to ex∣pect
should be allowed by an Objector. He can easily
believe of writers who are in little credit with him, that
they may run far wide of the truth, and really in∣tend
a fact that has but a small resemblance with their
<PB N="530" REF="548"/>
relation. With such what hath been said hitherto will
have little weight.</P>
<P>I PROCEED therefore to some other considerations.
II. I SAY then, that our Lord, in the words we
are now considering, instanceth in facts supposed to
have been done a considerable time before. The whole
tenour and design of his discourse assures us of it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Zacharias</HI> he mentions is not one whom they
of that age had themselves slain, but rather one of those
prophets whose tombs they built.</P>
<P>THE sum of what our Saviour says (if I mistake
not) is this: Ye say, <HI>If ice bad been in the days of our
fathers, we would not have been partakers with them
in the blood of the prophets.</HI> This you say; but, as
hereby you own, that you <HI>are the children of them that
killed the prophets;</HI> so by your conduct, by your ma∣lice,
your pride, your hypocrisy, your obstinate dis∣obedience
to God, you make it appear that you allow
the deeds of your fathers, and are their genuine off∣spring.
You even exceed them in wickednesse. You
are now filling up, and you will still go on to fill up
the measure of their iniquity. I am come among you
in my father's name, and have done works which no
man ever did; but you do not hearken to me. My
words you do not receive, and me you will crucifie,
God will still send among you, as he did to your fa∣thers,
prophets and wisemen, to instruct you in the
most excellent doctrine, to admonish and reclaim you:
but ye will kill and crucifie them, scourge them in your
synagogues, and persecute them from city to city.
Hereby you will make the wicked deeds of your fa∣thers
your own, and bring the guilt of them upon your
selves: You will hereby deserve, that all the righteous
blood shed from the foundation of the world, from
the blood of righteous <HI>Abel</HI> to the blood of <HI>Zacharias,</HI>
should be required of you: and verily I say unto you,
<HI>it shall be required of this generation.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord seems to me to remind them of instances
of disobdience and cruelty, which they were well ac∣quainted
<PB N="531" REF="549"/>
with, <HI>which they avowedly condemned,</HI> and pre∣tended
to see the evil of, but yet did, and would imi∣tate
in a most notorious manner: and hereby would
bring the guilt of them upon themselves. And the
conclusion of all obliges us to suppose, that the death
of the <HI>Zacharias</HI> he had mentioned, was an act of cru∣elty
committed by their fathers. This is the sense of
the words in both the Evangelists.</P>
<P>THIS appears to me so evident, that if there had
been no event recorded in any of their ancient writings
which anfwered to the death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> here descri∣bed
yet I should have supposed that there was some
such event, that had happened some time before, and
which they were then well acquainted with.</P>
<P><HI>III. HOWEVER, we have</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Whithy,</HI> Matth. xxiii, 36.</NOTE> <HI>a fact recorded in the</HI>
Old Testament <HI>which exactly answers the words of our
Saviour. It is in</HI> 2 Chron. <HI>xxiv.</HI> 17.—22. Now after
the death of Jehojada—they left the house of the Lord
God of their fathers—and wrath came upon Judah and
Jerusalem:—yet he sent prophets unto them to bring them
again unto the Lord, and they testified against them: but
they would not give ear. And the spirit of God came upon
Zachariah, the fin of <HI>Jehojada</HI> the priest, which stood
above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God,
Why transgresse ye the commandment of the Lord? And
they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
the commandment of the king in the court of the house of
the Lord. Thus Joash the king remembered not the kind∣ness
which Jehojada his father had done to him, but slew
his son: and when be died, he said, the Lord look upon it
and require it.</P>
<P>THIS fact is exactly parallel with that described by
our Lord. (1.) This <HI>Zachariah</HI> spoke in the name
of the Lord <HI>(the spirit of God came upon him).</HI> It was
suitable to our Lord's design to instance in the death of
a <HI>prophet. Ye say, if we had been in the days of our fa∣thers,
we would not have been partakers with them in the
death of the</HI> PROPHETS.—<HI>I send unto you</HI> PROPHETS, <HI>and
<PB N="532" REF="550"/>
wisemen and scribes. Abel</HI> was a <HI>righteous man,</HI> and this
<HI>Zacharias</HI> a <HI>prophet.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) THE place, in which this <HI>Zacharias</HI> is said to
have been killed, answers the description in the Evan∣gelists.
He was slain in the <HI>court if the house of the
Lord,</HI> that is, in the court of the priests, the inner
court of the temple. In both the Evangelists the same
place is specified, <HI>between the temple and the altar.</HI> This
particular circumstance of so remarkable an event was,
doubtless, handed down to them by tradition. Accord∣ing
to the account in the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> he was in the inner
court when he delivered his message from God to them:
<HI>He stood above the people.</HI> The ground of the inner
court was raised above the rest. He stood at the ex∣tremity
of that, and spoke to the people standing in
the next court below him. <HI>At the commandment of the
King,</HI> they rushed in upon <HI>Zachariah.</HI> He retired,
they pursued him and <HI>stoned him withstones,</HI> so that he
fell down in the space between the altar of burnt-offer∣ings
and the temple.</P>
<P>(3.) OUR Lord subjoins: <HI>whom</HI> YE SLEW. The
death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> was the act of the
nation, of King and People. This particular is added
to this instance with the highest propriety. The death
of <HI>Abel</HI> was the death of <HI>righteous man,</HI> but not commit∣ted
by them. The death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> was the act of
their ancestors, that is, of that people to whom our
Lord was speaking. For a nation is in all ages reckoned
the same people. <HI>And he answered and said unto them, what
did Moses command</HI> YOU? <HI>Mark</HI> x. 3. <HI>Verily I say unto
you, Moses gave</HI> YOU <HI>not that bread from heaven,</HI> John vi.
32. <HI>Did not Moses give</HI> YOU the law? <HI>Ch.</HI> vii. 19. See 22.</P>
<P>(4.) EXPRESSIONS made use of in the history of
<HI>Zacharias</HI> in the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> and by our Saviour in his
discourse to the <HI>Jews,</HI> put it past doubt that he intend∣ed
this fact, and alluded to this very account in that
book. <HI>Behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and
scribes.</HI> The history in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> begins thus: <HI>Yet
he sent unto them prophets to bring them again unto the
<PB N="533" REF="551"/>
Lord, and they testified against them,</HI> &amp;c. It concludes:
And when he died, he said, the Lord look upon il and require
it. Our Saviour tells the <HI>Jews, that the blood of all the
prophets would be required of that generation.</HI></P>
<P>(5.) As the fact related in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> does in all
its circumstances answer that described by our Lord,
so there is a suitablenesse in the order in which it stands
in our Lord's discourse. <HI>Abel</HI> is the first. <HI>righteous man</HI>
slain, and the death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> is the last act of cruel∣ty
to a <HI>prophet</HI> related in the <HI>Jewish</HI> sacred writings.</P>
<P>IV. IT ought to be observed, that there is an exact
harmony between the Evangelists, in the account they
have given of this discourse of our Saviour, though
there is no reason to think that one has copied the
other. This ought to satisfy us that no mistake has
been made.</P>
<P>IN one particular indeed there is a difference. In
St. <HI>Matthew Zacharias</HI> is stiled the son of <HI>Barachias,</HI>
whereas in St. <HI>Luke's,</HI> account it is not said who was his
father.</P>
<P>AND in this particular the person whom our Saviour
speaks of seems not to answer to him mentioned in the
<HI>Chronicles.</HI> For there he is called the son of <HI>Jehojada.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is therefore but one objection against sup∣posing,
that our Saviour meant the <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the
<HI>Chronicles.</HI> But it is such an objection, as deserves
consideration.</P>
<P>IT has been observed by<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. &amp; Whitb, in loc.</NOTE> divers learned men, that
many persons among the <HI>Jews</HI> were called by two names,
especially when their true name happened to have some
of the letters of the word <HI>Jehovah</HI> in it. For this reason
<HI>Barachias</HI> may have been used for <HI>Jehojada,</HI> since like∣wise
these two names have much the same meaning.</P>
<P>OTHER learned men suppose, that <HI>Barachias</HI> was
very early inserted into St. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Gospel by some
transcriber. There is the more reason for this supposi∣tion,
because it is wanting in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> Or else <HI>Jeho∣jada</HI>
might have been originally in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> but
<PB N="534" REF="552"/>
some Christian transcriber not well acquainted with the
<HI>Jewish</HI> history, nor knowing who <HI>Jehojada</HI> was, and
therefore suspecting that to be a mistake, might pretend
to correct it by putting <HI>Barachias</HI> in the room of <HI>Jeho∣jada.
Zachariah</HI> the son of <HI>Barachias,</HI> whose prophe∣cies
form one of the books of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> was
certainly better known among the Christians, than <HI>Za∣charias</HI>
the son of <HI>Jehojada.</HI> It is not at all unlikely
therefore, that our not having this name in St. <HI>Mat∣thew</HI>
may be owing to the ignorance and rashnesse of
some transcriber. This, supposition seems to be favour∣ed
by what St. <HI>Jerome</HI> says, who informs us, that in
the <HI>Gostel of the Nazarenes Zachariah</HI> is called <HI>the Son
of</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In evangelio quo utuntur Nazareni, pro filio Barachiae, filium Jojadae reperimus scriptum. S. Hieron. comment, Matth. xxiii. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Jehojada.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have thought, that there is a like instance in
<HI>Matth.</HI> xiii. 35, where we have these words: <HI>That it
mig't be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, I
will open my month in parables,</HI> &amp;c. The words of this
quotation are in <HI>Ps.</HI> lxxviii. 2. the title of which is <HI>Maschil
of Asaph. St. Jerome</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> says, that in some copies
of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> was written: <HI>That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophet Esaias.</HI> He thinks it was
originally: <HI>which was spoken by the prophet Asaph.</HI> But
some transcriber, not knowing <HI>Asaph</HI> to be a prophet,
put <HI>Esaias</HI> in his room. Afterward others, perceiving
there were no such words as those which follow here to
be found in <HI>Esaias,</HI> lest out his name. And from thence
forward in most copies it was written, <HI>which was spoken
by the prophet,</HI> saying, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I CRAVE leave to mention an observation, that
may support the former of these two suppositions, <HI>viz.</HI>
that originally <HI>the son of Barachias</HI> was wanting in St.
<HI>Matthew,</HI> as well as in St. <HI>Luke..</HI> The ancient Christi∣ans
seem to have been very much divided in their opi∣nion,
who was the <HI>Zacharias</HI> here spoken of. Many
Christians in St. <HI>Jerome</HI>'s time thought he was <HI>Zacharias</HI>
<PB N="535" REF="553"/>
the father of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist;</HI> borrowing this notion
(as he<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Com. in Matth. xxiii. 56.</NOTE> adds) from some Apocryphal books of no
authority. In the copies of St. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Gospel in
his time, he was stiled the son of <HI>Barachias,</HI> as in ours:
But the <HI>Nazarene</HI> Christians, being <HI>Jews</HI> by birth, and
understanding the history of their own nation, had it in
their Gospel, <HI>Zacharias the son of Jehojada.</HI> This in∣deed
was the truth, but it seems to have keen an inser∣tion.</P>
<P>BUT this is left to the reader to judge of, as he thinks
fit. It is highly probable, that one of these may be the
case; either that <HI>Jehojada</HI> not being well known, <HI>Ba∣rachias</HI>
was put in his room; or else, that <HI>the Son of
Barachias,</HI> was added.</P>
<P>THERE being so probable an account of this read∣ing,
I hope there remains no farther scruple about this
text.</P>
<P>THERE is another interpretation of these words, which
some have inclined to, namely, that the <HI>Zacharias</HI> here
mentioned is the <HI>Zacharias</HI> whose death <HI>Josephus</HI> has gi∣ven
us the history of: and that our Saviour spoke of
him by way of prophecy. But as there can be no ob∣jection,
which I am concerned with, formed against
the Evangelists from this sense of the words, I have
taken no notice of it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, I think it is by no means the true sense
of the place. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> observes very well, that
“Christ speaks here of the Prophets whom they had
slain, not of one who was to be slain a little before
the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> for then none of the
people could have understood his meaning.”</P>
<P>By the whole tenour of our Saviour's discourse, the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> he speaks of is excluded from the number of
those that were to be slain. If the <HI>Zacharias,</HI> whom
<HI>Josephus</HI> speaks of, was as good a man as he represents
him, and did faithfully reprove the wickednesse of the
prevailing party of his nation; he might be one of
<PB N="536" REF="554"/>
those <HI>holy and wise men,</HI> whom our Saviour foresaw
would be slain by the <HI>Jews:</HI> But he can never be the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> whom our Saviour mentioned by name; for
he is one of those <HI>prophets,</HI> which had been slain before,
and whose blood would be required of them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Theudas.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T will be proper in the next place to con∣sider
the objection relating to <HI>Theudas.</HI>
The Apostles were brought before the
council at <HI>Jerusalem: And when they took
counsel to slay them, Gamaliel commanded
to put the A Ostles forth a little space; and
said unto them, Ye men of Israel take heed to your selves,
what ye intend to do as touching these men.</HI> FOR BEFORE
THESE DAYS ROSE UP THEUDAS, <HI>boasting himself to be
some body, to whom a number of men, about four hundred,
joined themselves: who was slain, and all as many as
obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nought.</HI> AFTER
THIS MAN <HI>rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the
taxing, and drew away much people after him: and all,
even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed,</HI> Acts v. 34.
—36.</P>
<P>THIS speech of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> was made not long after
our Saviour's ascension. <HI>Ludovicus Cappellus</HI> places it
in the beginning of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spicileg. in Act. v. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Caligula's</HI> reign. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitby Par. on this text.</NOTE>
and others three or four years sooner, in the 20th of
<HI>Tiberius</HI> A. D. 34. And, <HI>Gamaliel</HI> here speaks of
<PB N="537" REF="555"/>
<HI>Theudas</HI> as having given disturbance before <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee,</HI> who in the days of the taxing drew away much
people. This refers doubtless to the assessement made
by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI> was deposed, when <HI>Judea</HI>
was reduced to a Roman<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jos. Antiq. lib. xvii. cap. ult. xviii. cap. 1. De B. Jud. lib. vii. cap. viii. §. 1.</NOTE> Province: which happen∣ed
in the sixth or seventh year of the Christian Aera.
It was at this time that <HI>Judas,</HI> whom <HI>Josephus</HI> calls
<HI>Judas Gaulanites,</HI> and likewise <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> rai∣sed
disturbances in that country.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Josephus</HI> gives us an account of an Impostor,
called <HI>Theudas,</HI> when <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI> was Procurator in
<HI>Judea;</HI> and therefore not before the fourth year of
<HI>Claudius</HI> the Roman Emperor A. D. 44. that is, seven
years after <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s speech was made, according to

<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI>'s words are these: “Whilst <HI>Fadus</HI>
was Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> a certain Impostor called
<HI>Theudas</HI> perswaded a very great multitude, taking their
effects along with them to follow him to the river <HI>Jor∣dan</HI>
For he said he was a prophet, and that causing
the river to divide at his command, he would give
them an easie passage over. By these speeches he de∣ceived
many. But <HI>Fadus</HI> was far from suffering them
to go on in their madnesse: for he sent out a troop of
horse, who, coming upon them unexpectedly, slew
many, and took many prisoners. <HI>Theudas</HI> himself
was among the latter. They cut off his head, and
brought it to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> These things happened in
<HI>Judea,</HI> while <HI>Cuspius Fadus</HI> was Procurator<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ant. 20. c. 4. §. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="538" REF="556"/>
IT may therefore be pretended, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
made a mistake. The <HI>Theudas</HI> whom <HI>Josephus</HI> men∣tions
appeared not till several years after <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s
speech was made. Nor has <HI>Josephus</HI> said any thing of
any other. The person, <HI>Gamaliel</HI> speaks of, is of the
same name. He likewise <HI>boasted himself to be some body,</HI>
that is, <HI>a prophet.</HI> He was slain, and his followers were
scattered. In these particulars <HI>Gamaliel</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI>
agree. Therefore they mean the same person, but
they differ mod widely about the time. For which
reafon St. <HI>Luke</HI> must have been mistaken.</P>
<P>DIVERS solutions have been offered of this dif∣ficulty.</P>
<P>1. SOME say, St. <HI>Luke</HI> might put the affair of
<HI>Theudas</HI> into <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s speech by way of anticipation.
He knew very well that <HI>Theudas</HI> did not appear till
after this time; but this being a very proper instance,
and suitable to the main scope and design of the speech
which <HI>Gamaliel</HI> made, He inserted it himself. But this
is not at all agreeable to the simplicity of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
narration, espaecially considering how particular he is as
to the number of <HI>Theudas</HI>'s followers: <HI>To whom a num∣ber
of men, about four hundred joined themselves.</HI> And
one would think <HI>Valesius</HI> was at a loss for examples of
anticipation, when the only one he produces is out of
a Poet, and that has scarce any resemblance with this
before us<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Alia quoque conciliandi ratio excogitari potest; si dicamus B. Lucam in eo loco <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> locutum esse. Quae quidem figura occurrit interdum apud antiquos scriptores, exempli causa apud Vir∣gilium, cum dicit:

<P>2. SOME think that <HI>Josephus</HI> has been mistaken,
and has misplaced <HI>Theudas</HI>'s insurrection. This solu∣tion
<HI>Valesius</HI> prefers before the former; and it is ap∣proved
<PB N="539" REF="557"/>
proved likewise by Mr.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clerici Histor. Eccl. A. D. 28. n. 60.</NOTE> <HI>Le Clerc.</HI> They under∣stand

some body. And if you look farther back<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sed quoniam Casaubonus negat Graecos unquam ita locutos fuisse, producendus est testis omni exceptione major.

<HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee.</HI>—Thus, according to <HI>Valesius, Jo∣sephus</HI>
has not misplaced this event of <HI>Theudas</HI> above
twelve years; but according to Mr. <HI>Le Clerc,</HI> the er∣rour
is greater, for he supposes he <HI>rose up</HI> A. D. 28.</P>
<P>BUT this kind of solutions appears to me perfectly
arbitrary, and not to be untying, but cutting the knot.
And I freely own, I have ho right to them. It is very
unlikely, that <HI>Josephus</HI> should have been mistaken
about the time of <HI>Theudas</HI>'s insurrection, which he
gives an account of. He may have made mistakes in
chronology: but <HI>Josephus</HI> is very express here, that
this affair happened in the time of <HI>Fadus;</HI> when he
himself must have been seven years of age.</P>
<P>AND in my opinion these learned men give a wrong
meaning to two expressions in <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s speech. It is
not necessary to understand those words, <HI>Before these
days rose up Theudas,</HI> of a <HI>little while ago,</HI> two or three
years before. These common phrases are loose and
undetermined in all languages, and signifie sometimes
a shorter, at others, a longer space of time. And the
subject matter of the discourse, or the coherence of
things, or some light from abroad, can alone determine
<PB N="540" REF="558"/>
what the space of time intended is. It is said: <HI>But Saul
increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews
which were at Damascus.</HI>—AND AFTER THAT MANY
DAYS <HI>were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him,</HI>
Acts ix. 22, 23. By these <HI>many days</HI> can be meant but
a short space of time, as appears from <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 17, 18.
St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells <HI>Felix: Forasmuch as. I know that thou hast
been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more
chearfully answer for myself,</HI> Acts xxiv. 10. Though it
is likely, <HI>Felix</HI> had not then been in <HI>Judea</HI> above five
years. And yet it might be said very properly, that he
had been there <HI>many years:</HI> since in five years time, a
Governour may be supposed to gain a good insight into
the laws and customs of his province, and the temper
of the people; as also, because very often Governours
were removed in a shorter space of time. When <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
solders had marched into <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with ensigns, the
<HI>Jews</HI> went from thence in a great body to <HI>Pilate</HI> at <HI>Ce∣sarea,</HI>
and there made <HI>supplications, Josephus</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 18. cap. 4. § 1.</NOTE> says,
<HI>many days.</HI> But it appears presently afterwards, that
on the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <HI>sixth day</HI> from their arrival <HI>Pilate</HI> seated him∣self
on his tribunal, and granted their petition. So <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
relates this in his <HI>Antiquities.</HI> In his <HI>War</HI> these
earnest supplications continued <HI>five whole days</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> l. 2. c. 9. § 2.</NOTE> <HI>and
nights.</HI></P>
<P>THUS these phrases, that seem to import a long duration,
are much limited by the connexion of a dis∣course,
or by the nature of the things spoken of. And
other phrases, that denote ordinarily a shorter dura∣tion,
must be understood sometimes with great lati∣tude.
There is an example in <HI>Jeremiah</HI> ch. xxxi. 31.
<HI>Behold</HI> THE DAYS COME <HI>saith the Lord, that I will make
a now covenant with the house of Israel.</HI> Ver. 33. AFTER
THOSE DAYS, <HI>saith the Lord, I will pit my law in their
inward parts.</HI> I suppose no one thinks, these promises
<PB N="541" REF="559"/>
or predictions were to be accomplished presently. <HI>Por∣phyry</HI>
says, “that many of the ancients had been sup∣posed
to understand the founds of birds and other
animals, and <HI>Apollonius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Porphyr. de Abst. l. 3. c. 3.</NOTE> of <HI>Tyana</HI> not long ago.”
<HI>Apollinius</HI> died before the end of the first century of the
Christian Aera. <HI>Porphyry</HI> was not born till the 232d,
or 233d year<NOTE N="O" PLACE="foot">Vid. Luc. Holsten. de Vit. &amp; Script. Porphyr. cap. 2.</NOTE> of the same Aera. Every one must
be sensible, with what latitude <HI>Porpbyrie's not long ago</HI>
is to be understood. I place another remarkable exam∣ple
from <HI>Cicero</HI> in the margin<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Quid ea, quae NUPER, id est paucis ante seculis, medicorum ingeniis reperta sunt? De Nat. deor. l. 2. c. 50.</NOTE></P>
<P>I SEE no necessity therefore of restraining the sense
of the phrase, <HI>before these days,</HI> to two or three years.
It may as well intend twenty or thirty years. It is plain
it does so here, since it was not till after <HI>Theudas,</HI> that
<HI>Judas</HI> rose up.</P>
<P>WHICH brings me to the other phrase misunder∣stood
by these learned men: <HI>After this man,</HI><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
The instances of the use of this preposition by Geogra∣phers
for a remoter distance are not to the point, be∣cause
here it imports time. And as for <HI>Valesius</HI>'s quo∣tation
from St. <HI>Clement;</HI> I think it not worth while to
consider here, whether he understand it aright or not.
At the best St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s passage. is very obseure and
perplexed. St. <HI>Luke's</HI> phrase is one of the most com∣mon
phrases in all the <HI>Greek</HI> language, and is ever un∣derstood
as it is rendered in this place by our transla∣tors.
It would be unreasonable to affix a new mean∣ing
to a very common phrase upon the single authority
of one obseure passage. This is said upon the supposi∣tion,
that the phrase in St. <HI>Clement</HI> was the same with
that in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and that the sense assigned by <HI>Valesius</HI>
to St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s passage was the most likely sense of any.
But indeed the phrase in St. <HI>Clement</HI> is not the same,
and for that reason is of the less weight here.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="560"/>
I SUPPOSE then that our translation is just, and
that the substance of this part of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s speech is
this: Not long since rose up <HI>Theudas.</HI> It might be
thirty years or more. The persons he spoke to knew
very well how long. And after this man, in the time
of the celebrated assessement, when <HI>Judea</HI> was made a
Roman province, rose up <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee.</HI> Both
thesc men perished, and their adherents were scat∣tered.</P>
<P>3. AND the solution, already offered by divers
learned<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Casub. Exerc. in Baron. ii. n. 18. Grot. &amp; Hamm. in Act. v. 36. Basnge Hist. des Juifs, l. 6. c. 9. §. 7. edit. 1706.</NOTE> men, of the difficulty under consideration,
appears to me perfectly jast. There were two <HI>Theu∣dases</HI>
in <HI>Judea</HI> that were impostors, one before <HI>Judas</HI>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> and another in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI> There
is no mistake upon this head in <HI>Josephus,</HI> nor in St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> who has given us an exact and true account of
<HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s speech.</P>
<P>IT is not at all unlikely, that there should be two
impostors in <HI>Judea</HI> of the same name in the compass of
about forty<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The interval cannot be shorter. <HI>Josephu's Theudas</HI> could not appear before the year 44. <HI>Gamaliel's Theudas</HI> rose up before <HI>Judais</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who made his disturbance in the 6th or 7th year of the Christain Aera.</NOTE> years, and that they should both come
to the same end. These are the two chief difficulties in
this matter, and they may be both cleared up.</P>
<P>(I.) IT is not at all strange, that there should be
two impostors in <HI>Judea</HI> of the name <HI>Theudas</HI> in the
space of forty years. There were several impostors
named <HI>Simon.</HI> Beside <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> mentioned in the
<HI>New Testament,</HI> and often spoken of by the first Chri∣stian
writers, there was one <HI>Simon</HI> a servant of <HI>Herod,</HI>
who, after his master's death, had the impudence to
set himself up for King, and put<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. 17. c. 12. §. 6.</NOTE> on a diadem.
After a long and obstinate engagement with <HI>Gratus,</HI>
<PB N="543" REF="561"/>
he was defeated, and his men were dispersed. He was
taken prisoner, and by <HI>Gratus</HI>'s order his head was<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, ibid.</NOTE>
cut off. There was another <HI>Simon,</HI> son of <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee,</HI> who Was crucified in the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. l. 20. c. 4. §. 2.</NOTE> reign of <HI>Claudius</HI>
by <HI>Tiberius Alexander,</HI> governour of <HI>Judea</HI> after <HI>Fadus.</HI>
There was in the time of <HI>Felix</HI> one <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI>
who pretended to Magic. I have already mentioned
him in another place<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Book. I. p. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE were likewise several <HI>Judases</HI> who gave di∣sturbance
to this country in a very short time. <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee</HI> was a noted person, mentioned here by <HI>Gamaliel,</HI>
and oftentimes by <HI>Josephus.</HI> He rose up in the time of
the taxing presently after the removal of <HI>Archelaus.</HI>
There was<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. cap. 12. §. 5.</NOTE> another <HI>Judas</HI><NOTE N="C" PLACE="foot">Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI> thinks this <HI>Judas</HI> to be <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s <HI>Theudas.</HI> “For whereas <HI>Jehudah</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> is the same with <HI>Theudah</HI> of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> from whence <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Thaddeus</HI> [compare <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 16. with <HI>Mark</HI> iii. 18.] and much rather <HI>Theudas,</HI> the same name plainly comes. This <HI>Judas</HI> seems to be no other than <HI>Theudas,</HI> of whom <HI>Gamaliel</HI> speaks <HI>Acts</HI> v. 36.” <HI>Annals,</HI> p. 797.</NOTE>, son of <HI>Ezechias,</HI>
who soon after <HI>Herod</HI>'s death affected regal authority,
and did a great deal of mischief. There was one <HI>Judas,</HI>
son of <HI>Sepphoraeus,</HI> a man in great reputation for his
skill in the law, who with some others raised a sedition
during <HI>Herod</HI>'s last sicknesse. He and some of his con∣sederates
<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. I. c. 33. §. 2.—4.</NOTE> were burnt alive. So that there were
three men of the same name, who in the space of about
ten years raised commotions in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) NOR is the agreement of <HI>character</HI> and <HI>circum∣stances</HI>
mentioned by <HI>Gamaliel</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI> a proof they
speak of one and the same person. There are but two
particulars of this sort: That they pretended to be ex∣traordinary
persons, and that they were slain and their
followers scattered or brought to nought. But in this
there is nothing extraordinary. Though there had
<PB N="544" REF="562"/>
been yet more circumstances, in which they had agreed
this would have been no proof that one and the same
person is spoken of.</P>
<P>GAMALIEL says: Theudas boasted himself to be
some body, <HI>and he</HI> was slain: Josephus, <HI>that</HI> Theudas said
he was a prophet, and his head was cut off.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has informed us, concerning the
<HI>Theudas</HI> he speaks of, that he got a good number of
people to follow him to <HI>Jordan.</HI> Though <HI>Gamaliel</HI> and
<HI>Josephus</HI> had concurred in so particular a circumstance
as this (which they do not) yet it would not have been
a sufficient reason for our supposing that they intended
the same person.</P>
<P>I SHALL give an instance. Of <HI>Simon</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 12. §. 6.</NOTE> above∣mentioned,
servant of <HI>Herod, Josephus</HI> says, that he
plundered and burnt the palace at <HI>Jericho.</HI> And that
he burnt several royal houses in divers parts, having
first given them to be plundered by his followers. He
says also, that the people with <HI>Simon</HI> were chiefly<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid.</NOTE>
<HI>Peraeans,</HI> or people that lived on the other side of <HI>Jor∣dan.</HI>
Afterwards, even while he is speaking of affairs
that passed in <HI>Judea</HI> soon after the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> he
says, that “at <HI>Amatha</HI> near <HI>Jordan</HI> a Royal Palace
was burnt down by a number of men very much like
those who were with<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Simon.</HI>”</P>
<P>IF <HI>Josephus</HI> had omitted this last fact, and some
other historian had related it, together with the name
of the leader of this body of men, and given them
their character; which if true, must have resembled
that of the men with <HI>Simon:</HI> unless the reputation of
this historian had been very well established, it would
have been thought that he was mistaken, and that the
person he meant was <HI>Simon,</HI> though he called him by
another name. A palace burnt down at <HI>Amatha</HI> by
<PB N="545" REF="563"/>
<HI>Jordan.</HI> Who could these be but <HI>Simon</HI>'s people, who,
<HI>Josephus</HI> says, were mostly <HI>Peraeans?</HI> Then the time
agrees exactly: Both facts in the abscnce of <HI>Archelaus</HI>
from <HI>Judea</HI> after his father's death. This writer there∣fore
must have been grosly mistaken in the name of the
person, to whom he ascribes the conduct of this ac∣tion.</P>
<P>OR, it is not unlikely, that Critics might have been
divided: Some would hive vindicated <HI>Josephus,</HI> and
some the other writer. And yet they would have been
all mistaken, unless they had allowed two different bo∣dies
of men, and two different matters to be spoken of,
and that both the historians were in the right.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that these impostors about this time
had a resemblance in their pretensions and their fates:
one boasted he would give his followers a passage over
<HI>Jordan,</HI> as <HI>Josephus</HI>'s <HI>Theudas:</HI> another promised his
people they should see the walls of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> fall down
before them, as the <HI>Egyptian</HI> impostor. The great
scene of expectation was the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiv. 26. Jos. Ant. 20. c. 7. §. 6. 10. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> wildernesse. But in
this they agreed universally, the company was routed
and dispersed; and usually the leaders executed. This,
we may be certain, was the case, or else the govern∣ment
had been overturned.</P>
<P>THESE few circumstances then, in which <HI>Gama∣liel</HI>'s
<HI>Theudas</HI> resembles him mentioned by <HI>Josephus,</HI> are
no good argument, that one and the same person is
intended.</P>
<P><HI>BESIDES, there is one material circumstance, in
which they differ.</HI> Gamaliel <HI>says:</HI> Before these days rose
up Theudas, - to whom a number of men, about four hun∣dred
joined themselves. <HI>But</HI> Josephus <HI>says of his</HI> Theudas,
<HI>that he</HI> perswaded a very great multitude to follow him.
<HI>And that</HI> many were slain, <HI>and</HI> many taken prisoners.
Josephus'<HI>s</HI> Theudas <HI>must have had with him a much lar∣ger
company than the former.</HI></P>

that the ancients generally agreed there was a

has taken no notice of him. <HI>Beza</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> was of opi∣nion
that the <HI>Theudas,</HI> of whom <HI>Gamaliel</HI> speaks, did
not arise before our Saviour's nativity, but soon after
<HI>Herod</HI>'s death, in that sort of interregnum, which there
was in <HI>Judea,</HI> whilst <HI>Archelaus</HI> was at <HI>Rome.</HI> Which
was also Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI>'s opinion, as I have shewn
above.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that this was a time of the utmost
confusion. <HI>Josephus</HI> has mentioned several by name,
who then gave disturbance in that country; and hint∣ed
at mischiefs done by others, whose names he has
not put down. It is plain he has past by many more
than he has mentioned. For he says: “At that
time<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 12. §. 4. vid. &amp; de B. l. z. c. 4.</NOTE> there were innumerable disturbances in
<HI>Judea.</HI>”</P>
<P>CONSIDERING all these things, that there had
been before this many pretenders in <HI>Judea;</HI> that <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
has been far from mentioning all that rose up in
the later end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, and in that remarkable
time of confusion which succeeded his death; sincc
there had been in this country in a very short time di∣vers
adventurers for power and authority of one and
the same name; and since <HI>Theudas</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Frequens erat id nomen apud Hebraeos. Itaque non mirum est diversis temporibus plures extitisse factiosos homines ejusdem no∣minis. Grot. in loc.</NOTE> was no uncom∣mon
name among the <HI>Jews;</HI> and since these leaders of
parties and factions very much resembled each other,
and that sometimes in more particulars than those spe∣cified
by <HI>Gamaliel;</HI> it is not at all unlikely, that there
were two <HI>Theudases</HI> who were impostors. We may de∣pend
upon it there were. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> speaks of one who
<PB N="547" REF="565"/>
was before <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Josephus</HI> of another
in the time of <HI>Claudius.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED I am somewhat surprized that any learned
man should find it hard to believe, that there were two
Impostors in <HI>Judea</HI> of the name of <HI>Theudas</HI> in the com∣pass
of forty years<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Duos enim Theudas fuisse, qui se prophetas esse mentiti, alter post alterum Judaeos ad spem rerum novarum concitaverint, nun∣quam adduci possim ut credam. Vales. ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Egyptian Impostor.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is yet another particular, in
which it has been thought by some that
<HI>Josephus</HI> contradicts St. <HI>Luke.</HI> In the
xxi. of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles</HI> is the ac∣count
of the <HI>uproar</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when
the <HI>Jews</HI> apprehended <HI>Paul,</HI> and would
have <HI>killed him.</HI> When the chief captain had taken him
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> and had got him in his own custody,
it is said, he put this question to him: <HI>Art not thou that
Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and
leddest out into the wildernesse</HI> FOUR THOUSAND <HI>men that
were murderers?</HI> Acts xxi. 38.</P>
<P>THE objection lies against the number here men∣tioned.
For <HI>Josephus,</HI> speaking of this same <HI>Egyptian,</HI>
says: he gathered together <HI>thirty thousand men.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the story twice told in <HI>Joseephus;</HI> in his
<HI>Antiquities,</HI> and in his History of the <HI>Jewish War.</HI> I
shall set down <HI>Josephus</HI>'s words, and leave it to the
reader to judge, whether an objection of any weight
can be formed against St. <HI>Luke</HI> from the account we
have of this affair in <HI>Josephus.</HI> I shall in the first place
transcribe the account in the <HI>Jewish War,</HI> because that
was first writ.</P>
<P>“BUT the <HI>Egyptian</HI> false prophet brought a yet
heavier disaster upon the <HI>Jews.</HI> For this impostor
coming into the country and gaining the reputation
of a prophet, gathered together thirty thousand men
<PB N="549" REF="567"/>
who were deceived<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. De Bell. z. c. 13. §. 5.</NOTE> by him. Having brought
them round out of the wildernesse up to the mount
of Olives, he intended from thence to make his at∣tack
upon <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and having beaten the Roman
Guard, to bring the people into subjection to him,
and govern them by the help of his armed associates.
But <HI>Felix</HI> coming suddenly upon him with the Ro∣man
soldiers, prevented the attack: and all the
people joined with him in their own defense; so
that, when they came to engage, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> fled,
followed by a few only. A great number [or the
greatest part] of those that were with him were either
slain or taken prisoners. The rest of the multitude
being scattered shifted for themselves as they could.”</P>
<P>THE account he gives of this affair in the <HI>Antiqui∣ties</HI>
is thus: “About the same time [<HI>he had been speak∣ing
of some other events in the beginning of Nero's reign</HI>]
there came<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 20. c. 7. §. 6.</NOTE> a person out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
who pretended to be a Prophet, and having per∣swaded
a good number of the meaner sort of people
<PB N="550" REF="568"/>
to follow him to the Mount of Olives, he told them,
that from thence he would let them see the walls of
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> fall down at his command, and promised
through them to give them entrance into the City.
But <HI>Felix</HI> being informed of these things ordered his
soldiers to their arms. And marching out of <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
with a large body of horse and foot, fell upon
those who were with the <HI>Egyptian:</HI> killed four hun∣dred
of them, and took two hundred prisoners. But
the <HI>Egyptian</HI> getting out of the fight, escap'd.”</P>
<P>THE reader, if he thinks it needful, may consult
the commentators and other writers, who<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grot. Whitby in loc. Joseph. p. 1075. not. p. Vales. in Eu∣seb. Hist. l. ii. c. 21.</NOTE> have
considered this difficulty. <HI>Grotius</HI> supposes, that they
were at first but <HI>four thousand;</HI> but that at length they
increased to the number of <HI>thirty thousand. Valesius</HI> rec∣kons
there were <HI>four tbousand</HI> only that were <HI>murderers</HI>
or <HI>sicarii,</HI> tho' the whole company amounted to the
number <HI>Josephus</HI> mentions. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> thinks, that it
is likely the number in <HI>Josephus</HI> was originally <HI>three
thousand.</HI> And certainly none of these solutions are
contemptible. But, for my own part, I think there
is more need of reconciling <HI>Josephus</HI> with himself, or at
lest one of these accounts with the other, than to re∣concile
St. <HI>Luke</HI> with <HI>Josephus.</HI></P>
<P>IF indeed we had any good reason to think, that
the number in <HI>Josephus</HI> was originally three thousand,
the disagreement would be small. The number of a
multitude got together in a short time, and soon dis∣persed,
might not be exactly known: the chief cap∣tain
at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> might compute them at four thou∣sand,
and <HI>Josephus</HI> think they were but three thou∣sand.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Aldrich</HI> has proposed another very ingenious
conjecture: that originally the number of the whole
company in <HI>Josephus</HI>'s <HI>War of the Jews</HI> was four thou∣sand,
and that the number of <HI>two hundred</HI> said in the
<PB N="551" REF="569"/>
<HI>Antiquities</HI> to be taken prisoners was originally <HI>two
thousand:</HI> Both which errors might happen only by a
very small alteration<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Suspicamur interim pro <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> scriptum olim <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> permutatis <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, vel etiam δ &amp; δ ex <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> factum esse <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ne dubitamus quidem. Aldr. in Joseph. p. 1075. Not. p.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT I choose not to insist upon any of these solu∣tions,
which rely on emendations made without the
authority of any Manuscripts. The numbers in <HI>Jo∣sephus</HI>
are at present plainly faulty. In the first ac∣count
he says they were thirty thousand in all, and
that a <HI>great number of these were either slain or taken
prisoners.</HI> I might have rendered the words, <HI>the most
of them,</HI> or <HI>the greatest part of them.</HI> But though I
have not given them that sense, yet certainly the <HI>four
hundred slain</HI> and <HI>two hundred taken prisoners,</HI> in the
other account, cannot be reckoned a <HI>great number</HI> or
a <HI>large part</HI> of thirty thousand.</P>
<P>BUT then, as I do not insist on these conjectural
emendations for reconciling <HI>Josephus</HI> with St. <HI>Luke;</HI>
so, on the other hand, it would be very unfair, first;
to take it for granted that the number of thirty thou∣sand
in <HI>Josephus</HI> is right; and then arbitrarily to re∣form
all the other numbers in him, in order to form
an objection against the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>I THINK, therefore there can be no objection
brought against the numbers in St. <HI>Luke</HI> from what
<HI>Josephus</HI> has said of this affair, because his two ac∣counts
are not consistent one with another in this
point: And that is sufficient.</P>
<P>THESE were my thoughts concerning this difficul∣ty
formerly. But I have now an observation to offer
to the reader, which I think will not only reconcile
St. <HI>Luke</HI> with <HI>Josephus,</HI> but likewise <HI>Josephus</HI> with him∣self;
and that without making any alterations in his
numbers. This observation has been communicated to
me by the truly learned and accurate Mr. <HI>John Ward,</HI>
Rhetorick Professor at <HI>Gresham Colledge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="552" REF="570"/>
THE history of this impostor seems to lye thus.
H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome first to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> went from thence into
the country, and taking a circuit by the wilderness re∣turned
again to the mount of <HI>Olives.</HI> In the <HI>Antiquities</HI>
(which contain the shorter account of this affair) <HI>Jose∣phus</HI>
mentions only the beginning and end of the story,
that is, the imposter's coming at first to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
and at last to the mount of <HI>Olives;</HI> and drops the
middle part, of which he had given a sufficient ac∣count
in the books of the <HI>War.</HI> The chief captain's
<HI>four thousand</HI> therefore were the men carried out of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
who were afterwards<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in <HI>Josephus,</HI> seem very well adapted to this distinction.</NOTE> joined by others in
the country to the number of <HI>thirty thousand,</HI> as related
by <HI>Josephus.</HI>'Tis likely also, that before he left the
city, he had so concerted matters with some friends,
whom he left behind him, as to entertain hopes, that
upon his return his design would be favoured by great
numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and that he should
have no opposition from any but the <HI>Romans.</HI> But up∣on
his arrival at the mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> finding the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
drawn out to attack him, and the citizens in
general prepared to oppose him, he did not dare to
venture an engagement, but presently fled with a
body of his most: trustly friends, as is usual in such
cases. With these in particular the <HI>Roman</HI> soldiers
were ordered to engage, neglecting the rest, who
were only a confused multitude, and immediately
made off as they could by different wayes. When
therefore <HI>Josephus</HI> says, <HI>the Egyptian fled accompanied by
a few</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>only,</HI> he is to be understood of that body
which at first fled away with the impostor, and were but
<HI>a few</HI> with respect to the whole <HI>thirty thousand.</HI> When
he says, <HI>the greatest</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>part, or most of those that were
with him were slain or taken prisoners,</HI> which in the <HI>An∣tiquities
<PB N="553" REF="571"/>
dred taken,</HI> he means the <HI>greatest part</HI> of those <HI>few that
fled</HI> with him. Nor need it be thought strange, that
the number of the slain and the prisoners is no greater;
since, as it seems, <HI>Josephus</HI> speaks only of that body
of men who fled with the impostor. 'Tis possible,
some of the rest of the multitude might be killed like∣wise,
though <HI>Josephus</HI> takes no notice of them; but
'tis most likely not many. For it seems by <HI>Josephus,</HI>
as if only the <HI>Roman</HI> soldiers marched out against them,
while the <HI>Jewish</HI> people in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> stood upon their
defence, if any onset had been made upon them.</P>
<P>THUS then, though there were but <HI>four thousand</HI> of
these men at first, they might be joined by others af∣terwards
to the number of <HI>thirty thousand.</HI> So St. <HI>Luke</HI>
is reconciled with <HI>Josephus.</HI> And the number, said by
<HI>Josephus</HI> to be <HI>slain or taken prisoners,</HI> might be a <HI>great
number,</HI> or the <HI>greatest part,</HI> of that body which fled
with the <HI>Egyptian</HI> upon the attack made by <HI>Felix</HI> and
his soldiers Thus <HI>Josephus</HI> is reconciled with him∣self.</P>
<P>BUT yet I cannot leave the History <HI>Josephus</HI> has
given us of this <HI>Egyptian,</HI> without making two or
three observations.</P>
<P>1. THE chief captain here asks St. <HI>Paul: Art not
thou that Egyptian which</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">'O' <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> LEDDEST OUT <HI>into the wil∣dernesse?</HI>
—which seems to imply, since the question
was asked in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that these men, or a good
number of them at lest, were drawn out of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI>
And <HI>Josephus</HI> says expresly in the later account,
that this impostor came <HI>out of Egypt to Jerusalem; and
perswaded a good number of the meaner sort of people, (i. e.</HI>
who were there) to <HI>follow him.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE chief captain speaks of their being <HI>led out
into the</HI> WILDERNESSE. This circumstance <HI>Josephus</HI> has
mentioned in the first account, where he more particu∣larly
relates their march, and the compasse they took,
than in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="572"/>
3. THIS <HI>Egyptian</HI> escaped. <HI>Josephus</HI> has put down
this in both places, and undoubtedly this is supposed in
the question put to St. <HI>Paul</HI> by the chief captain. The
agreement in this particular deserves to be taken notice
of, because it was the common fate of these impo∣stors
to perish themselves with a good number of
their followers.</P>
<P>4. THIS <HI>Egyptian</HI> caused this disturbance, accord∣ing
to <HI>Josephus,</HI> when <HI>Felix</HI> was Governour of <HI>Judea.</HI>
This impostor therefore did not arise any long time
before the seisure of St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> He might
be still living therefore: In this respect there was no
absurdity in this question of the chief captain.</P>
<P>5. ANOTHER particular, which we are obliged to
<HI>Josephus</HI> for, is, <HI>that all the people (sc.</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem)</HI>
favoured, or joined with <HI>Felix,</HI> upon this occasion, in
their own defense: That is, all but some very mean
people. If <HI>Josephus</HI> had not mentioned this, perhaps
it would have been said: Since considerable numbers
usually joined these impostors, and it is likely more
favoured them; how was it possible, that the chief
captain should ask <HI>Paul,</HI> when he saw the whole city
was in an uproar, and the people were ready to tear
him to pieces: <HI>Art not thou that Egyptian?</HI> that pre∣tended
prophet, that <HI>before these days</HI> madest <HI>an up∣roar?</HI>
a man of a favourite character at this time
among the <HI>Jews!</HI></P>
<P>I THINK indeed, that if <HI>Josephus</HI> had omitted this
circumstance, it would have been a very good reply, to
say, that the chief captain did not yet know what was
the matter: And though there was a loud cry in the
multitude, of <HI>away with him;</HI> yet the confusion was
such, <HI>some saying one thing,</HI> and <HI>some another,</HI> that the
chief captain had yet no notion what the case was.
However we have no occasion to have recourse to this
reply. <HI>Josephus</HI> has told us, that all the people fa∣voured
<HI>Felix</HI> in his enterprize against this man: whe∣ther
it was because he came from <HI>Egypt,</HI> or what was
the reason, is of no importance.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="573"/>
6. THERE is a remarkable agreement between the
chief captain in the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Josephus,</HI> in the descrip∣tion
they give of this man. The chief captain says:
<HI>Art not thou that Egyptian?</HI> And it is obfservable, that
<HI>Josephus</HI> has not mentioned this man's name in either
of the accounts. In the first he calls him the <HI>Egyp∣tian
false prophet,</HI> and <HI>the Egyptian.</HI> In the other, he
says, <HI>there came one</HI> (or a certain person) out of <HI>Egypt:</HI>
And again, <HI>Felix</HI> fell upon those who were <HI>with the
Egyptian:</HI> But the <HI>Egyptian</HI> escaped.</P>
<P>WE have then in the <HI>Acts</HI> the exact manner, in
which the <HI>Jews</HI> about this time spoke of this impo∣stor.
This is with me a proof, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> lived and
wrote about this time: that is, at the time he is suppo∣sed
to write. We have here undoubtedly the chief
captain's question in the very words in which it was
put. St. <HI>Luke</HI> must have received this account from
St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or some one else who was present, if he was
not by himself.</P>
<P>I HOPE therefore, that the account, which <HI>Josephus</HI>
has given of this impostor will be no longer reckon'd
an objection against St. <HI>Luke,</HI> but a confirmation of
his history.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE now performed what I under∣took,
and have shewn, that the account
given by the Sacred Writers of persons
and things is confirmed by other anci∣ent
Authors of the best note. There is
nothing in the books of the <HI>New Te∣stament</HI>
unsuitable to the age, in which
they are supposed to have been writ. There appears
in these Writers a knowledge of the affairs of those
times not to be found in authors of later ages. <HI>We are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reby assured, that the books of the New Testament are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and that they were writ by persons who lived at
or near the time of those events, of which they have given
the history.</HI></P>
<P>ANY one may be sensible, how hard it is for the
most learned, acute, and cautious man, to write a
book in the character of some person of an earlier
age; and not betray his own time by some mistake
about the affairs of the age in which he pretends to
place himself, or by allusions to customs or princi∣ples
since sprung up, or by some phrase or expres∣sion
not then in use. It is no easy thing to escape
<PB N="557" REF="575"/>
all these dangers in the smallest performance, though
it be a treatise of theory or speculation. These ha∣zards
are greatly encreased, when the work is of any
length, and especially if it be historical, and be con∣cerned
with characters and customs. It is yet more
difficult to carry on such a design in a work con∣sisting
of several pieces, writ to all appearance by se∣veral
persons. Many indeed are desirous to deceive,
but all hate to be deceived. And therefore, though
attempts have been made to impose upon the world
in this way, they have never or very rarely suc∣ceeded,
but have been detected and exposed by the
skill and vigilance of those who have been concerned
for the truth.</P>
<P>THE Volume of the <HI>New Testament</HI> consists of
several pieces. These are ascribed to eight several
persons. And there are the strongest appearances,
that they were not all writ by any one hand, but
by as many persons as they are ascribed to. There
are lesser differences in the relations of some facts,
and such seeming contradictions as would never have
happened, if these books had been all the work of
one person, or of several who writ in concert. There
are as many peculiarities of temper and stile, as there
are names of writers: divers of which shew no depth
of Genius, or compasse of knowledge. Here are re∣presentations
of the titles, posts, behaviour of persons
of higher and lower rank in many parts of the world.
Persons are introduced, and their characters are set in
a full light. Here is a history of things done in seve∣ral
cities and countries; and there are allusions to a
vast variety of customs and tenets of persons of seve∣ral
nations, sects, and religions. The whole is writ
without affectation, with the greatest simplicity and
plainnesse, and is confirmed by other ancient writers
of unquestioned. authority</P>
<P>IF it be difficult for a person of learning and ex∣perience
to compose a small treatise, concerning mat∣ters
<PB N="558" REF="576"/>
of speculation, with the characters of a more
early age than that in which he writes; it is next to
impossible, that such a work of considerable length,
consisting of several pieces, with a great variety of
historical facts, representations of characters, princi∣ples,
and customs of several nations and distant coun∣tries,
of persons of all ranks and degrees, of many
interests and parties, should be performed by eight
sevral persons, the most of them unlearned, without
any appearance of concert.</P>
<P>I MIGHT perhaps have called this argument a de∣monstration,
if that term had not been often misap∣plied
by men of warm imaginations, and been be∣stowed
upon reasonings that have but a small degree
of probability. But though it should not be a strict
demonstration, that these writings are genuine: or tho'
it be not absolutely impossible in the nature of the
thing, that the books of the <HI>New Testament</HI> should
have been composed in a later age than that to which
they are assigned, and of which they have innumera∣ble
character; yet, I think, it is in the highest de∣gree
improbable, and altogether incredible.</P>
<P><HI>IF the books of the New Testiament were writ by per∣sons
who lived, before the destruction of Jerusalem, that is,
if they were writ at the time in which they are said to
have been writ, the things related in them are true.</HI> If
they had not been matter of fact, they would not have
been credited by any persons near that time, and in
those parts of the world in which they are said to
have been done, but would have been treated as the
most notorious lies and falshoods. Suppose three or
four books should now appear amongst us in the lan∣guage
most generally understood, giving an account
of many remarkable and extraordinary events which
had happened in some kingdome of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in
the most noted cities of the countries next adjoining to
it; some of them said to have happened between sixty
and seventy years ago, others between twenty and
<PB N="559" REF="577"/>
thirty, others nearer our own time: Would not they
be looked upon as the most manifest and ridiculous
forgeries and impostures that ever were contrived?
Would great numbers of persons, in those very places,
change their religious principles and practises upon the
credit of things reported to be publickly done, which
no man had ever heard of before? Or rather, is it
poslible that such a design as this should be conceived
by any sober and serious persons, or even the most
wild and extravagant?</P>
<P><HI>IF the histiory of the New Testament be credible, the
Christian Religion is true.</HI> If the things here related co
have been done by Jesus, and by his followers, by vir∣tue
of powers derived from him, do not prove a person
to come from God, and that his doctrine is true and
divine, nothing can. And as Jesus does here in the
circumstances of his birth, life, sufferings, and after
exaltation, and in the successe of his doctrine, answer
the description of the great person promised and fore∣told
in the <HI>Old Testiament,</HI> he is at the same time shew∣ed
to be the Messiah.</P>
<P><HI>FROM the agreement of the writers of the New
Testament with other ancient writers we are not only as∣sured
that these books are genuine, but also that they are
come down to us pure and uncorrupted, without any con∣siderable
interpolations or alterations.</HI> If such had been
made in them, there would have appeared some smal∣ler
differences at lest between them and other ancient
writings.</P>
<P>THERE has been in all ages a wicked propensity
in mankind to advance their own notions and fansies
by deceits and forgeries. They have been practised
by <HI>Heathens, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> in support of ima∣ginary
historical facts, religious schemes and practises,
and political interests. With these views some whole
books have been forged, and passages inserted into
others of undoubted authority. Many of the Chri∣stian
writers of the second and third centuries, and of
<PB N="560" REF="578"/>
the following ages, appear to have had false notions
concerning the state of <HI>Judea</HI> between the nativity of
Jesus and the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and concern∣ing
many other things occasionally mentioned in the
<HI>New Testament.</HI> The consent of the best ancient wri∣ters
with those of the <HI>New Testament</HI> is a proof, that
these books are still untouched, and that they have
not been new modelled and altered by Christians of
later times in conformity to their own peculiar sen∣timents.</P>
<P>THIS may be reckoned an argument, that the
generality of Christians have had a very high vene∣ration
for these books or else, that the several sects
among them have had an eye upon each other, that
no alterations might be made in those writings, to
which they have all appealed. It is also an argument,
that the Divine Providence has all along watched over
and guarded these best of books (a very fit object of
an especial care) which contain the best of princi∣ples,
were apparently writ with the best views, and
have in them inimitable characters of truth and sim∣plicity.</P>

<HEAD>AN
APPENDIX
Concerning the time of Herod's
death,</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N all enquiries concerning the
chronology of the <HI>New Testament,</HI>
and particularly concerning the
true time of our Saviour's nativi∣ty,
and the commencement of his
ministry, it is very needful to
take into consideration the time
of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's death. In∣deed
it is very desirable in the first place to settle
exactly the date of this event. But to do this is a
very hard task. Nor has any one yet been so happy,
as to remove all difficulties, and give universal satis∣faction
upon this head.</P>
<P>THAT none may be quite at a losse in judging
of the difficulty considered in the <HI>third</HI> chapter of
this Book, I shall here give a brief account of this
matter.</P>
<P><PB N="562" REF="580"/>
THE chief opinions at present concerning the time
of <HI>Herod's</HI> death are these three. Some think he died
a little before the passover of A. U. 750, <HI>Julian</HI>
year 42. others, on <HI>Novemb.</HI> 25, that same year:
others, a short time before the Passover, A. U.
751.</P>
<P>§. I. THE <HI>English</HI> reader may see all, in a man∣ner,
that can be said for the second opinion, in
Mr. <HI>Whiston's short View of the Harmony of the four
Evangelists, Prop.</HI> 12. But, though several very
learned men have embraced this opinion, it appears
to me a meer hypothesis without foundation. The
only ground of it is a <HI>Jewsih</HI> account of their Feasts
and Fasts, in which that day is noted as a Feast, be∣cause
on it <HI>Herod</HI> died. But<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>With.</HI> Annotat. <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 23. <HI>Lany</HI> Apparat. Chronol. Par. i. cap. 9. §. 3.</NOTE> this book appears to
be of no authority.</P>
<P>§. II. THAT <HI>Herod</HI> died but a short time before
some one of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Passovers, is evident from
<HI>Josephus.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. 2. c. 1. Antiq. 17. c. 9.</NOTE> If we reject entirely his authority, it
is in vain to talk about the time of <HI>Herod's</HI> death.
<HI>Archelaus</HI> kept a Passover in <HI>Judea</HI> after his father's
death, before he went to <HI>Rome;</HI> which he would
not have done, if it had not been near. He had
good reason to hasten to <HI>Rome.</HI> He had many ene∣mies.
<HI>Herod Antipas</HI> had been appointed his father's
successor in a former Will, and he pretended that
Will ought to take place. When the <HI>Jews</HI> at the
temple made their demands of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> he gave
them fair words, that they might not make any di∣sturbance
and retard his journey<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Antiq. 17. c. 9. §. 1.</NOTE>, he being in hast
<PB N="563" REF="581"/>
to go to <HI>Rome.</HI> This hast is expressed by <HI>Josephus</HI>
in the <HI>War,</HI> and in the <HI>Antiquities</HI> in very strong
terms. <HI>Archelaus,</HI> in his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>Cesarea,</HI>
met <HI>Sabinus,</HI> the Emperour's Procurator in <HI>Syria,</HI>
who was going<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. ibid. §. 3. vid. &amp; De Bell. ibid. c. 2. §. 2.</NOTE> in all hast to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to secure
<HI>Herod's</HI> treasure for <HI>Augustus.</HI> By help of the in∣tercessions
of <HI>Varus,</HI> president of <HI>Syria</HI> (who was
then likewise at <HI>Cesarea) Archelaus</HI> prevailed upon
<HI>Sabinus</HI> to promise, that he would not proceed any
farther. But notwithstanding that, when <HI>Archelaus</HI>
was gone away, he went up to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and there
ordered all things, according to his own will and
pleasure. This was all managed without any orders
from <HI>Rome.</HI> If <HI>Herod</HI> had been dead two or three
months, they would have had directions from thence
upon this matter. Nay, if <HI>Herod</HI> had been dead one
month, this vigilant Procurator would have been at
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> before now. I take this to be a kind of
demonstration, that, according to <HI>Josephus, Herod</HI>'s
death happened but a very short space before some
Passover.</P>
<P>§. III. THAT <HI>Herod</HI> died a little before the Passo∣ver
A. U. 750, <HI>Julian</HI> year 42, is argued in this
manner. His distemper had made great progresse
before the pulling down the Golden Eagle at the
Temple. The <HI>Jewish Rabbies</HI> excited their scholars
to this action, <HI>News being brought that Herod</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. 1. c. 33. §. 1.</NOTE> <HI>was</HI>
DYING, as it is in the <HI>War;</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Antiq. 17. c. 6. §. 3.</NOTE> DEAD, as it is in
the <HI>Antiquities.</HI> These Rabbies were taken up and
carried to <HI>Jericho,</HI> where <HI>Herod</HI> was. A council was
<PB N="564" REF="582"/>
called, and they were tried. <HI>Herod</HI> was so ill that
he could not stand, and notwithstanding the new
strength<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. 1. c. 33. §. 4.</NOTE> which rage gave him upon this occasi∣on,
he was carried<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. ibid.</NOTE> to the council in a chair. Soon
after this these Rabbies were burnt to death, and that
very<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ibid. §. 4.</NOTE> night there was an eclipse of the moon.
This eclipse, according to astronomical computations,
happened<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petav. Doctrin. Temp. l. xi. c. 1.</NOTE> the 13th of <HI>March,</HI> A. U. 750. Af∣ter
this, <HI>Herod</HI> grew worse and worse. It is plain,
he could not live long. The Passover<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lamy App. Chron. p. 58.</NOTE> of this
year happened the 11th of <HI>April.</HI> From the 13th
of <HI>March</HI> to the 11th of <HI>April</HI> is a sufficient space of
time for all that <HI>Josephus</HI> has related concerning <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s
illnesse, his settling his affairs, the execution of
<HI>Amipater, Herod</HI>'s death and funeral; which are the
things placed between the eclipse and <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s com∣ing
to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the Passover.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>War</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> De Bell. l. 2. c. 7. §. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that <HI>Archelaus</HI> was
banished in the ninth year of his reign: In the <HI>Anti∣quities,</HI>
that he was accused before <HI>Augustus</HI> by the
<HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans</HI> in the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> L. 17. c. 15. §. 2.</NOTE> tenth year of his go∣vernment.
In his <HI>own life Josephus</HI> says, that his fa∣ther
was born in the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> §. 1.</NOTE> tenth year of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
reign. From whence one would be apt to conclude,
that <HI>Archelaus</HI> reigned <HI>nine</HI> years compleat; and that
the <HI>tenth</HI> year was current, when he was banished.
<PB N="565" REF="583"/>
<HI>Dio</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> l. 55. p. 567. B.</NOTE> places <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s banishment in the 759th
year of <HI>Rome.</HI> If <HI>Herod</HI> did not die till the begin∣ning
of A. U. 751, the ninth year of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
reign could not be compleated in the 759th year of
<HI>Rome.</HI> But if <HI>Herod</HI> be supposed to have died the
beginning, of A. U. 750, <HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Dio</HI> agree.
Moreover, <HI>Josephus</HI> says, that<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Antiq. l. 18. c. 2. §. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Cyrenius</HI> seised <HI>Ar∣chelaus</HI>'s
estate, and finished the Assessement in <HI>Ju∣dea</HI>
in the <HI>thirty seventh year after the defeat of An∣tony
at Actium by Cesar Augustus.</HI> The victory at
<HI>Actium</HI> was obtained the 2d. <HI>Septemb.</HI> A. U. 723.
Therefore the 37th year from it begins 2d. <HI>Septemb.</HI>
A. U. 759, and ends 2d. <HI>Sept.</HI> 760. Supposing then,
that <HI>Herod</HI> died the beginning of A. U. 750, there is
in this particular also a very good harmony between
<HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Dio.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is however one great difficulty attending
this opinion. For <HI>Josephus</HI> has said in two places,
that <HI>Herod</HI> reigned <HI>thirty four years</HI> after the death
of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> de B. J. l. 1. c. ult. §. 8. vid. &amp;. Antiq. 17. c. 8. §. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Antigonus;</HI> and <HI>thirty seven years</HI> after he was
declared King by the Roman Senate. And he places
this declaration<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 14. c. §. 5. De B. 1. c. 14. §. 4.</NOTE> of the Senate in A. U. 714, the
death of<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 14. c. ult. §. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Antigonus</HI> in the year 717. If indeed at
the beginning of A. U. 750, <HI>Herod</HI> had reigned
thirty six years compleat from the first date of his
reign, and thirty three from the later; so that the
37th of the one epocha, and the 34th of the o∣ther
<PB N="566" REF="584"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>e to be current at the time of his death;
then <HI>Herod</HI> might be said not improperly to have
reigned, with respect to the one, thirty seven years,
and to the other, thirty four. It is supposed by some
learned men that <HI>Herod</HI> was declared king by the Se∣nate,
<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Alix. de J. C. Anno &amp; mense natali. p. 75.</NOTE> toward the very end of the year 714; by
others<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Basnage Ann. Polit. E. Vol. 1. P. 17. n. 16.</NOTE> the later end of <HI>October</HI> or beginning of
<HI>November;</HI> by others<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Noris. Cenot. Pis. p. 139. Pagi Appar. p. 80.</NOTE> in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October;</HI> by
others<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whiston's short view,</HI> p. 150.</NOTE> about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> that year. But
then, at the beginning of the year 750, <HI>Herod</HI> could
not have reigned from this date thirty six years com∣pleat,
nor was the 37th year current. <HI>Herod</HI> took
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as some<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alix ubi supra, p. 117.</NOTE> think in <HI>September</HI> A. U. 717;
others<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whiston</HI> ibid. p. 152. <HI>Basnage</HI> ibid. p. 30. n. 9.</NOTE> about the end of <HI>June;</HI> Archbishop
Usher<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Annals. p. J. 4677.</NOTE>, on the first of <HI>January</HI> this year. If the
Archbishop's supposition could be allowed, we should
have here no difficulty. But if any of the others are
followed, then from this date of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, <HI>viz.</HI>
the taking of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or the death of <HI>Antigonus</HI>
(which are all one) to the beginning of the year 750,
we have not quite thirty three years compleat, nor is
the thirty fourth current.</P>
<P>IN answer to this difficulty it is said<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Inde etiam anni regum Hebraeorum supputabantur, ita ut si ouis Rex in Adar regnaret, a Nisan alter annus imperii ejus inciperet. Reland. Antiq. Heb. de Temporib. sacris, c. 1. init. vid. &amp; Kepler. de. ann. natal. J. C. cap. 7. p. 46.</NOTE> by learn∣ed
men, that the years of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Kings were com∣puted
from the beginning of the month <HI>Nisan,</HI> which
usually answers pretty near to our <HI>March.</HI> Insomuch
that, if a King began to reign in any part of the
year before, even in <HI>Febrauary,</HI> another year of his reign
would begin with <HI>Nisan,</HI> that is, <HI>March</HI> So <HI>Josephus</HI>

<HI>Antony</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were Consuls; by <HI>Herod</HI> when <HI>M.

been taken by him on the same</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 16. §. 4.</NOTE> <HI>day twenty seven
years before:</HI> Though there were but twenty six
years compleat between these two events. And from
the taking of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by <HI>Herod</HI> to its destruction
by <HI>Titus, Josephus</HI> computes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid 20. c 9. vid. Kepler ibid.</NOTE> one hundred and se∣ven
years, though it was but one hundred and six
compleat. But, in my opinion, these instances are
not home to the point. For in them the year named
is current. Whereas, in the case before us it is not
so. If <HI>Herod</HI> died in the beginning of the year 750,
the thirty third and thirty sixth years of his reign were
not compleat.</P>
<P>§. IV. OTHER<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lamy Appar. Chron. Par. i. c. ix. Basnage Annal. Pol. Eccl. Vol. i. p. 156. n. v.</NOTE> learned men suppose that <HI>He∣rod</HI>
died a short time before the Passover A. U. 751.
This they argue from the number of years assigned
to <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign in the places above mentioned.
They do not allow the truth of the <HI>Talmudical</HI> ac∣count
of computing the Reigns of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Kings
from the beginning of <HI>Nisan,</HI> or from the Passover.
If <HI>Josephus</HI> had followed such a kind of computation,
he would have given some hint of it in his books
writ in the <HI>Greek</HI> language and for the instruction of
strangers. They say also, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s was a slow
lingring distemper and that it is not likely he should
die so soon after the execution of the Rabbies and
their accomplices, as is supposed by the Patrons of
the former opinion. Lastly, they observe the<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> the learned men, who espouse the former opinion, sup∣pose also that <HI>Josephus</HI>'s numbers in all other places agree with them.</NOTE>
<PB N="568" REF="586"/>
agreement of all the other numbers in <HI>Josephus</HI> con∣cerning
the dates of the reign of <HI>Archelaus</HI> and other
sons of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>THIS opinion however labours under several very
great difficulties. <HI>Dio</HI>'s account of the removal of
<HI>Archelaus</HI> is entirely rejected. But to do this<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid. Noris. Cenot. Pis. p. 147.</NOTE> is
not very reasonable. Farther, the supporters of this
opinion must allow of the eclipse abovementioned; or
they must say it was no real eclipse, but only some
obscurity that was taken for an eclipse. If they al∣low
the eclipse, then <HI>Herod</HI> must have lived a year
after the execution of the Rabbies, provided he
died<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quae aptis temporibus tribui non possunt, nisi haec mors contigerit jam aliquibus mensibus promoto Anno U. C. 751, in quo comprobavimus mortuum fuisse Herodem. Quoquo autem anno mortuus sit, NON MULTIS ANTE PASCHA DIEBUS mors illa obtigit, ut testatur Josephus, cui fidem adhibemus. Lamy ubi supra. §.</NOTE> but a few days before the Passover, A. U.
751. But it is incredible that <HI>Herod</HI> should live so
long, considering the description <HI>Josephus</HI> gives of his
distemper. Besides, it is evident that the mourning
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> people for the Rabbies, at the Passo∣ver
next after <HI>Herod</HI>'s death, was<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>De B. 2. c. 1. §. 2. vid. &amp; Antiq. 17. c. 9. §. 1.</NOTE> very fresh, which
it could not have been, if the Rabbies had been dead
above a year before. Moreover, it is evident, that
<HI>Herod</HI>'s ambassadors were sent away to <HI>Rome</HI> to know
<HI>Augustus</HI>'s pleasure concerning <HI>Antipater,</HI> some<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De B. 1. c. 32. fin. Antiq. 17. C. 5. fin.</NOTE>
time before the disturbance at the Temple, when the
Golden Eagle was taken down. And it is very plain,
that <HI>Herod</HI> lived not<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De B. ibid. c. 33. §. 7, 8. Antiq. ibid. c. 7. &amp; c. 8.§ 1.</NOTE> many days after the arrival
of the ambassadors. So that according to this opinion
these ambassadors must have spent above a year in
their journey from <HI>Judea</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> and back again,
<PB N="569" REF="587"/>
though they were sent upon very pressing businesse,
which is also incredible. Or they must reject the ac∣count
of the eclipse and say, as Father <HI>Lamy</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ubi supra, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6.</NOTE> does,
that it was only a palenesse or obscurity which was no
real eclipse of the Moon; which, I believe, will ap∣pear
very unreasonable to all Astronomers.</P>
<P>THESE are the three principal opinions concerning
the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s death. And these the main argu∣ments
for, and objections against them. I presume it
appears to the reader from particulars alledged from
<HI>Josephus</HI> and <HI>Dio,</HI> That <HI>Herod</HI> did not die before the
year 750, nor survive the year 751: And that he
died a short time before the <HI>Jewish</HI> Passover, of one
of these years. It follows, that if <HI>Herod</HI> died in 750,
he died three years and nine months before the Vul∣gar
Christian AEra, which commences <HI>January</HI> 1,
A. U. 754: If at the time abovementioned in the
year 751, then he died about two years and nine
months before the said AEra, Which is the truth, I
dare not determine.</P>
