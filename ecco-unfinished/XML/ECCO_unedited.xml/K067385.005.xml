<P>IN a nation divided like the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXIX.</NOTE> it could scarce
be expected, that the death of one sovereign, and
the accession of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1558.</NOTE> who was strongly sus∣pected
to have embraced opposite principles to those
which prevailed, could be the object of universal satis∣faction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's po∣pularity.</NOTE> Yet so much were Men displeased with the
present conduct of affairs, and such apprehensions were
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking
their theological disputes, expressed a very general and
unfeigned joy that the scepter had passed into the hands
of Elizabeth. That princess had discovered great pru∣dence
in her conduct during the reign of her sister; and
as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which
she was every moment exposed, the compassion towards
her situation, and concern for her safety, had rendered
her, to an uncommon degree, the favourite of the na∣tion.
A Parliament had been assembled a few days be∣fore
Mary's death; and when Heathe, archbishop of
York, then chancellor, notified to them that event,
scarce an interval of regret appeared; and the two
houses immediately resounded with the joyful accla∣mations
of “God save Queen Elizabeth: Long and
happily may she reign.” The people, less actuated
by faction, and less influenced by private views, expres∣sed
a joy still more general and hearty or her procla∣mation;
and the auspicious commencement of this reign
prognosticated that felicity and glory which, during its
whole course, so uniformly attended it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at Hatfield when she heard of her
sister's death; and after a few days she proceeded thence
to London, thro' crowds of People, who strove with
each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their
affections. On her entrance into the Tower, she
could not forbear reflecting on the great difference be∣tween
her present fortune and that which a few years
before had attended her, when she was conducted to
that place as a prisoner, and lay there exposed to all
the bigotted malignity of her enemies. She fell on her
knees, and expressed her thanks to heaven, for the de∣liverance
which the Almighty had granted her from her
bloody persecutors; a deliverance, she said, no less mi∣raculous
than that which Daniel had received from the
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
den of lions. This act of pious gratitude seems to
have been the last circumstance in which she remem∣bered
any past injuries and hardships. With a pru∣dence
and magnanimity truly laudable, she buried all
offences in oblivion, and received with affability even
those who had acted with the greatest virulence against
her. Sir Harry Bennifield himself, to whose custody
she had been committed, and who had treated her with
uncommon severity, never felt, during the whole course
of her reign, any effects of her resentment<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vol. II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>74.</NOTE>. Yet was
not the gracious reception which she gave, prostitute
and undistinguishing. When the bishops came in a
body to make their obeisance to her, she expressed to
all of them sentiments of regard; except to Bonner,
from whom she turned aside, as from a Man polluted
with blood, who was a just object of horror to every
heart susceptible of humanity.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Heylin, p. 102.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER employing a few days in ordering her do∣mestic
affairs, Elizabeth notified to foreign courts, her
sister's death, and her own accession to the crown. She
sent lord Cobham to the low Countries, where Philip
then resided; and she took care to express to that mo∣narch,
her gratitude for the protection which he had af∣forded
her, and her desire of persevering in that friend∣ship
which was so happily commenced between them.
Philip, who had long foreseen this event, and who still
hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion
over England, which he had failed of in espousing Ma∣ry,
immediately dispatched orders to the duke of Feria,
his ambassador at London, to make proposals of mar∣riage
to the Queen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e offered to procure from
Rome a dispensation for that purpose. But Elizabeth
soon came to the resolution of declining this propo∣sal.
She saw that the nation had entertained an ex∣treme
aversion to the Spanish alliance during her sis∣ter's
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
reign; and that one great cause of the popularity
which she herself enjoyed, was the prospect of being
freed, by her means, from the danger of foreign sub∣jection.
She was sensible that her affinity with Phi∣lip
was exactly similar to that between her father and
Catharine of Arragon; and that her marrying that mo∣narch
was, in effect, declaring herself illegitimate, and
incapable of succeeding to the throne. And tho' the
power of the Spanish monarchy might still be sufficient,
in opposition to all pretenders, to support her title, her
masculine spirit disdained such precarious dominion,
which, as it would depend solely on the power of ano∣ther,
must be exercised according to his inclination<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden in Kennet, p. 370. Burnet, vol. II. p. 375.</NOTE>.
But while these views prevented her from entertaining
any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, she gave him
a very obliging, tho' evasive, answer; and he still re∣tained
such hopes of success, that he sent a messenger
to Rome, with orders to sollicit the dispensation.</P>
<P>THE Queen too, on her sister's death, had wrote to
Sir Edward Carne, the English ambassador at Rome,
to signify her accession to the pope; but the precipitate
nature of Paul broke thro' all the cautious measures con∣certed
by that young princess. He told Carne, that
England was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief of the holy see; and it was a great
temerity in her to have assumed, without his partici∣pation,
the title and authority of Queen: That Eliza∣beth,
being illegitimate, could not possibly inherit that
kingdom; nor could he annul the sentence pronounced
by Clement the seventh, and Paul the third, with regard
to Henry's marriage: That were he to proceed with ri∣gour,
he would punish this criminal invasion of his
rights, by rejecting all her applications; but being wil∣ling
to treat her with paternal indulgence, he would
still keep the door of grace open to her: And that if she
would renounce all pretensions to the throne, and sub∣mit
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
entirely to his will, she should experience the ut∣most
lenity which was compatible with the dignity of
the apostolic see<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. v.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1585.</NOTE> When this answer was reported
to Elizabeth, she was astonished at the character of
that aged pontiff; and having recalled her ambassador,
she continued with more determined resolution to pur∣sue
those measures which she had already secretly em∣braced.</P>
<P>THE Queen, not to alarm the partizans of the catho∣lic
religion, had retained eleven of her sister's coun∣cellors;
but in order to ballance their authority, she
added eight more who were known to be affectionate to
the protestant communion: The marquis of Nor∣thampton,
the earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir
Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir Francis Knolles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re-estab∣lishment of the pro∣testant re∣ligion.</NOTE>
Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom she created lord keeper, and
Sir William Cecil, secretary of state<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann. vol. I. p. 5.</NOTE>. With these
councellors, particularly Cecil, she frequently deliberated
concerning the expediency of restoring the protestant
religion, and the means of executing that great enter∣prise.
Cecil told her, that the greatest part of the na∣tion
had, ever since her father's reign, inclined to the
reformation; and tho' her sister had constrained them
to profess the ancient faith, the cruelties exercised by her
ministers had still more alienated their affections from
it: That happily the interests of the sovereign concur∣red
here with the inclinations of the people; nor was
her title to the crown compatible with the authority of
the Roman pontiff: That a sentence, so solemnly pro∣nounced
by two popes against her mother's marriage,
could not possibly be recalled, without inflicting a mor∣tal
wound on the credit of the see of Rome; and even if
she was allowed to retain the crown, it would only be
on an uncertain and dependant footing: That this mo∣tive
counterballanced all dangers whatever; and these
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
dangers themselves, if narrowly viewed, would be
found very little formidable: That the curses and exe∣crations
of the Romish church, when not seconded by
military force, were, in the present age, more an object
or ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influ∣ence
in this world as in the next: That tho' the bigo∣try
or ambition of Henry or Philip might incline them
to execute a sentence of excommunication against her,
their interests were so incompatible, that they never
could concur in any plan of operations; and the enmity
of the one would always ensure to her the friendship of
the other: That if they encouraged the discontents of
her catholic subjects, their dominions also abounded
with protestants, and it would be easy to retaliate that
injury upon them: That even such of the English as
seemed at present zealously attached to the catholic
faith, would most of them embrace the religion of their
new sovereign; and the nation had of late been so accu∣stomed
to these revolutions, that men had lost all idea
of truth and falsehood in such subjects: That the autho∣rity
of Henry the eighth, so highly raised by many con∣curring
circumstances, first enured the people to this
submissive deference; and it was the less difficult for
the succeeding princes to continue the nation in a train
to which it had been so long accustomed: And that it
would be easy for her, by bestowing on protestants all
the commissions in civil offices and the militia, the
church and the universities, both to ensure her own au∣thority,
and to render her religion entirely predomi∣nant<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 377. Camden, p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE education of Elizabeth, as well as her interest,
led her to favour the reformation; and she remained not
long in suspense with regard to the party, which she
should embrace: But, tho' determined in her own mind,
she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps,
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
and not to imitate the example of Mary, in encoura∣ging
the bigots of her party to make immediately a vio∣lent
invasion on the established religion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 378. Camden, p. 371.</NOTE>. She thought
it requisite, however, to discover such symptons of her
intentions, as might give encouragement to the protes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants,
so much depressed by the late violent presecution.
She immediately recalled all the exiles, and gave liberty
to the prisoners who were confined on account of reli∣gion.
We are told of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on
this occasion, who said to the Queen, that he had a peti∣tion
to present her in behalf of other prisoners called
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: She readily replied,
that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners them∣selves,
and to learn of them whether they desired that
liberty, which he demanded for them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH also proceeded to exert, in favour of the
reformers, some acts of power, which were consistent
with the extent of the royal prerogative, during that age.
Finding, that the protestant teachers, irritated by perse∣cution,
broke out in a furious accack on the antient su∣perstition,
and that the Romanists replied with no less
zeal and acrimony, she published a proclamation, by
which she inhibited all preaching without a special li∣cence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. I. p. 41.</NOTE>; and tho' she dispensed with these orders in fa∣vour
of some preachers of her own sect, she took care,
that they should be the most calm and moderate of the
party. She also suspended the laws so far as to order a
great part of the service; the litany, the Lord's prayer,
the creed, and the gospels; to be read in English. And
having first published injunctions, that all the churches
should conform themselves to the practice of her own
chapel, she forbad the hoste to be any more elevated in
her presence; an innovation, which, however frivo∣lous
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
it may appear, implied the most material conse∣quences<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 371. Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. I. p. 54. Stowe▪ p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE declarations of her intention, concurring
with the preceding suspicions, made the bishops fore∣see
with certainty a revolution in religion. They
therefore refused to officiate at her coronation; and it
was with some difficulty, that the bishop of Carlisle was
at last prevailed on to perform that ceremony. When she
was conducted thro' London, amidst the joyful accla∣mations
of her subjects, a boy, who personated Truth,
was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and
presented her with a copy of the Bible. She received
the book with the most gracious deportment, placed it
next her bosom, and declared, that, admist all the cost∣ly
testimonies which the city had that day given her of
their attachment, this present was by far the most pre∣cious
and most acceptable<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 380. Strype, vol. I. p. 29.</NOTE>. Such were the innocent
artifices, by which Elizabeth insinuated herself into
the affections of her subjects. Open in her address,
gracious and affable in all public appearances, she re∣joiced
in the concourse of her Subjects, entered into all
their pleasures and amusements, and without departing
from her dignity, which she knew well how to preserve,
she acquired a popularity beyond what any of he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pre∣decessors
or successors ever could attain. Her own sex
exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with
such prudence and fortitude: And while a young prin∣cess
of twenty-five years (for that was her age at her
accession) who possessed all the graces and insinuation,
tho' not all the beauty of her sex, courted the affections
of individuals by her civilities, of the public by her ser∣vices,
her authority, tho' corroborated by the strictest
bands of law and religion, appeared to be derived en∣tirely
from the choice and inclination of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
A SOVEREIGN of this disposition was not likely to
offend her subjects by any useless or violent exertions
of power;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1559.</NOTE> and Elizabeth, tho' she threw out such hints
as encouraged the protestants, delayed the entire change
of religion till the meeting of the Parlia∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> which
was summoned to assemble. The elections had gone
entirely against the catholics, who seemed not indeed
to have made any great struggle for the superiority;
and the Houses met in a disposition of gratifying the
Queen in every particular, which she could desire of
them. They began the session with an unanimous de∣claration,
“that Queen Elizabeth was, and ought to
be, as well by the word of God, as the common and
statute laws of the realm, the lawful, undoubted, and
true heir to the crown, lawfully descended from the
blood-royal, according to the order of succession,
settled in the 35th of Henry VIII<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 3.</NOTE>.” This act of
recognition was undoubtedly dictated by the Queen her∣self
and her ministers; and she shewed her magnanimity,
as well as moderatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the terms, which she em∣ployed
on that occasion. She followed not Mary's
practice in declaring the validity of her mother's mar∣riage,
or in expresly repealing the act formerly made a∣gainst
her own legitimacy: She knew, that this attempt
must be attended with reflexions on her father's me∣mory,
and on the birth of her deceased sister; and as all
the world were sensible that Henry's divorce from Anne
Boleyn was merely the effect of his violence and ca∣price,
she scorned to found her title on any act of an
assembly, which had too much prostituted its autho∣rity
by its former variable, servile, and iniquitous de∣cisions.
Satisfied therefore in the general opinion en∣tertained
with regard to this fact, which appeared the
more undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered in for∣tifying
it by votes and enquiries; she took possession
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
of the throne, both as her birth-right, and as ensured
to her by former acts of Parliament; and she never ap∣peared
sollicitous to distinguish these titles<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 372. Heylin, p. 107, 108.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first bill which was brought into the Parliament,
with a view of trying their disposition with regard to
religion, was that for suppressing the monasteries lately
erected, and for restoring the tenths and first-fruits to
the Queen. This point being gained without much
difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the
supremacy to the crown; and tho' the Queen was
there denominated <HI>governess,</HI> not <HI>head,</HI> of the church,
it conveyed the same extensive power, which had for∣merly
been exercised by her father and brother. All
the bishops who were present in the upper house stre∣nuously
opposed this law; and as they possessed more
learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in
the argument; but the majority of voices in that
house, as well as among the commons, were against
them. By this act the crown, without the concur∣rence,
either of the Parliament or even of the convo∣cation,
was vested with the whole spiritual power;
might repress all heresies<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">In determining heresy, the crown was only limited (if that could be called a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy, by the authority of the Scripture, by the first four general councils, or by any ge∣neral council, which followed the Scripture as their rule, or to such other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the Parliament and convocation. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>, might establish or repeal
all canons, might alter every point of discipline, and
might ordain or abolish any religious rite or ceremo∣ny<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 1. This last power was anew granted in the act of uni∣formity. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. In order to exercise this unlimited authority,
the Queen, by a clause of the act, was empowered to
name commissioners, either laymen or clergymen, as
she should think proper; and on this clause was after∣wards
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
founded the court of ecclesiastical commission;
which assumed very large discretionary, not to say ar∣bitrary
powers, totally incompatible with any exact
limitations in the constitution. Their proceedings in∣deed
were only consistent with absolute monarchy;
but were entirely suitable to the genius of the act on
which they were established; an act that at once gave the
crown all the power, which had formerly been claim∣ed
by the popes, but which even these usurping pre∣lates
had never been able fully to exercise, without
some concurrence of the clergy.</P>
<P>WHOEVER refused to take an oath, acknowledging
the Queen's supremacy, was incapacitated from holding
any office; whoever denied the supremacy, or attempt∣ed
to deprive the Queen of that prerogative, forfeited,
for the first offence, all their goods and chattels; for
the second were subjected to the penalty of a premu∣nire;
but the third offence was declared treason. These
punishments, however severe, were less rigorous than
such as were formerly, during the reigns of her father
and brother, inflicted in like cases.</P>
<P>A LAW was passed, confirming all the statutes enact∣ed
in King Edward's time with regard to religion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>:
The nomination of bishops was given to the crown
without any election of the chapters: The Queen was
empowered, on the vacancy of any see, to seize all the
temporalities, and to bestow on the bishops-elect an
equivalent, in the impropriations belonging to the
crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly ve∣ry
much inferior in value; and thus the Queen, amidst
all her concern for religion, followed the example of
the preceding reformers, in committing depredations on
the ecclesiastical revenues.</P>
<P>THE bishops and all incumbents were prohibited
from alienating their revenues, and from letting leases
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
longer than twenty-one years or three lives. This law
seemed to be intended for securing the property of the
church; but as an exception was left in favour of the
crown, great abuses still prevailed. It was usual for
a courtier, during this reign, to make an agreement
with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a fic∣titious
alienation to the Queen, who afterwards trans∣ferred
the lands to the person agreed on<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 79.</NOTE>. This me∣thod
of pillaging the church was not remedied till the
beginning of James the first. The present depression
of the clergy exposed them to all injuries; and the
laity never stopped till they had reduced the church to
such poverty, that her plunder was no longer a compen∣sation
for the odium incurred by it.</P>
<P>A SOLEMN and public disputation was held during
this session, in presence of Lord-keeper Bacon, be∣tween
the divines of the protestant and those of the
catholic party. The champions appointed to defend
the religion of the sovereign, were, as in former in∣stance,
entirely triumphant, and the popish disputants,
being pronounced refractory and obstinate, were even
punished by imprisonment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95.</NOTE>. Emboldened by this
victory, the protestants ventured on the last and most
important step, and brought into Parliament a bill<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>
for abolishing the mass, and re-establishing the li∣turgy
of King Edward. Penalties were enacted, as
well against those who departed from this mode of
worship, as those who absented themselves from the
church and the sacraments. And thus in one session,
without any violence, tumult, or clamour, was the
whole system of religion altered, on the very commence∣ment
of a reign, and by the will of a young woman,
whose title to the crown was by many esteemed liable
to great objections: An event, which, tho' it may ap∣pear
surprising to men in the present age, was every
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
where expected on the first news of Elizabeth's ac∣cession.</P>
<P>THE commons also made a sacrifice to the Queen,
more difficult to obtain than that of any articles of
religion: They voted a subsidy of four shillings in the
pound on land, and two shillings and eight pence on
goods, together with two fifteenths<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">The Parliament also granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poun∣dage; but this accession was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and she had levied these duties before they were voted by the Parlia∣ment: But there was another exertion of power, which she practised, and which people, in this age, from their ignorance of the antient con∣stitution, may be apt to think a little extraordinary. Her sister, after the commencement of the war with France, had, from her own authority, imposed four marks on each ton of wine imported, and had encreased the poundage a third on all commodities. Queen Elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she thought convenient. The Parliament, who had so good an opportunity of restraining these arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and poundage, thought proper not to make any men∣tion of them. They knew, that the sovereign, during that age, pre∣tended to have the sole regulation of foreign trade, and that their inter∣meddling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the severest reproof, if not chastisement. See Forbes, vol. I. p. 132, 133. We know certainly from the statutes and journals, that no such impositions were granted by Parliament.</NOTE>. The house in
no instance departed from the most respectful defe∣rence
and complaisance towards the Queen. Even the
importunate address, which they made her on the con∣clusion
of the session, to fix her choice of a husband,
could not, they supposed, be very disagreeable to one
of her sex and age. The address was couched in the
most respectful expressions; yet met with a refusal from
the Queen. She told the speaker, that, as the appli∣cation
from the house was conceived in general terms,
only recommending marriage, without pretending to
direct her choice of a husband, she could not take
offence at the address, or regard it as other than a new
instance of their affectionate attachment towards her:
That any farther interposition on their part would have
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
ill become either them to make, as subjects, or her
to hear as an independant princess: That even while
she was a private person, and exposed to much dan∣ger,
she had always declined that engagement, which
she regarded as an incumbrance; much more, at pre∣sent
would she persevere in that sentiment, when the
charge of a great kingdom was committed to her, and
her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the
interests of religion and the happiness of her subjects:
That as England was her husband, wedded to her by
this pledge (and here she shewed them her finger with
the same gold ring upon it, with which she had solemn∣ly
betrothed herself to the kingdom at her inagura∣tion)
so all Englishmen were her children; and while
she was employed in the rearing or governing such a
family, she could not deem herself barren, or her life
useless and unfruitful: That if she ever entertained
thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her
subjects welfare would still be uppermost in her
thoughts; but should she live and die a virgin, she
doubted not but the divine providence, seconded by
their counsels and her own measures, would be able
to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession,
and secure them a sovereign, who, perhaps better than
her own issue, would imitate her example in Ioving
and cherishing her people: And that for her part, she
desired that no higher character, nor fairer remembrance
of her should be transmitted to posterity, than to have
this inscription engraved on her tomb-stone, when she
should pay the last debt to nature; “Here lies Eliza∣beth,
who lived and died a maiden Queen<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 375. Sir Simon d'Ewes.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>AFTER the prorogation of the Parliament<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">It is thought remarkable by Camden, that tho' this session was the first of the reign, no person was attainted; but on the contrary, some re∣stored in blood by the Parliament. A good sympton of the lenity, at least of the prudence, of the Queen's government.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> the
laws enacted with regard to religion, were put in ex∣execution,
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
and met with no opposition from any quar∣ter.
The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar
tongue, and the oath of supremacy was tenderd to the
clergy. The number of bishops had been reduced to
fourteen by a very sickly season, which preceded; and
all of these, except the bishop of Landaffe, having re∣fused
compliance, were degraded from their sees: But
of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where
there are near 10,000 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rishes, only eighty parish
rectors, fifty prebendaries, fifteen heads of colleges,
twelve, archdeacons, and as many deans, sacrificed their
livings to their religious principles<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 376. Heylin, p. 115. Strype, vol. I. p. 73. with some small variations.</NOTE>. Those in high
ecclesiastical stations, who were exposed to the eyes of
the world, seem chiefly to have placed a point of honour
in their preseverance; but on the whole, the protes∣tants,
in the former change introduced by Mary, ap∣pear
to have been much more rigid and conscientious.
Tho' the catholic religion, adapting itself to the senses,
and requiring observances, which enter into the com∣mon
train of life, does at present lay much faster hold
of the mind than the reformed, which, being chiefly
spiritual, resembles more a system of metaphysicks;
yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowledge,
during the first ages after the reformation, much great∣er
on the side of the protestants. The catholics con∣tinued,
ignorantly and supinely, in their antient belief,
or rather their antient practices: But the reformers,
obliged to dispute on every occasion, and enflamed to
a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution, had
strongly attached themselves to their tenets; and were
ready to sacrifice their fortunes, and even their lives, in
defence of their speculative and abstract principles.
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
The forms and ceremonies, still preserved in the Eng∣lish
liturgy, as they bore some resemblance to the an∣tient
service, tended farther to reconcile the catholics
to the established religion; and as the Queen permitted
no other mode of worship, and at the same time struck
out every thing that could be offensive to them in
the new liturgy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. III.</NOTE>, even those addicted to the Romish
communion made no scruple of attending the esta∣blished
church. Had Elizabeth gratified her own in∣clinations,
the exterior appearance, which is the chief
circumstance with the people, would have been still
more similar between the new and the antient form of
worship. As she loved state and magnificence in every
thing, she was somewhat addicted to the pomp of the
catholic religion; and it was merely in compliance
with the prejudices of her party, that she gave up ei∣ther
the images or the addresses to the saints, or prayers
for the dead<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 376. 397. Camden, p. 371.</NOTE>. Some foreign princes interposed to
procure the Romanists the privilege of separate assem∣blies
in particular cities, but the Queen would not com∣ply
with their request; and represented the manifest dan∣ger
of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of
different religions<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 378. Strype, vol. I. p. 150. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the Queen and Parliament were employed in
settling the public religion, the negotiations for a
peace were still conducted first at Cercamp, then at
Chateau-Cambresis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE>, between the ministers of France,
Spain, and England; and Elizabeth, tho' equally pru∣dent,
was not so successful in this transaction. Philip
employed his utmost efforts to procure the restitution
of Calais, both as bound in honour to indemnify Eng∣land,
which, merely on his account, had been drawn
into the war, and as engaged in interest to remove
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
France from his frontiers in the Low Countries. So
long as he entertained hopes of espousing the Queen,
he delayed concluding a peace with Henry; and even
after the change of religion in England deprived him
of all such views, his ministers hinted a proposal, which
may be regarded as reasonable and honourable. After
all his own terms with France were settled, he seemed
willing to continue the war, till she should obtain satis∣faction;
provided she would stipulate to adhere to the
Spanish alliance, and continue hostilities against Hen∣ry,
during the course of six years.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Forbes's Full View, vol. I. p. 59.</NOTE>: But Elizabeth,
after consulting with her ministers, very wisely re∣jected
this proposal. She was sensible of the low state
of her finances; the great debts contracted by her fa∣ther,
brother and sister; the disorders introduced into
every part of the administration; the divisions by which
her people were agitated; and she was convinced that
nothing but tranquillity during some years could
bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition,
or enable her to act w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h dignity and vigour, in her
transactions with foreign nations. Well acquainted
with the value which H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry put upon Calais, and the
impossibility of recovering it by treaty, during the pre∣sent
emergency, the was willing rather to suffer that
loss, than submit to such a dependance on Spain, as she
must expect to fall into, if she continued pertinaciously
in her present demand. She ordered, therefore, her am∣bassadors,
the Lord Effingham, the bishop of Ely, and
Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negociation, and to set∣tle
a peace with Henry, on any reasonable terms. Hen∣ry
offered to stipula<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a marriage between the eldest
daughter of the dauph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and the eldest son of Eliza∣beth;
and to engage for the restitution of Calais as the
dowry of that princess<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 54.</NOTE>; but as the Queen was sen∣sible
that this treaty would appear to the world a
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
palpable evasion, she insisted upon more equitable, at
least, more plausible conditions. It was at last agreed,
that Henry should restore Calais at the expiration of
eight years; that in case of failure, he should pay five
hundred thousand crowns, and the Queen's title to
Calais still remain; that he should find the Security of
seven or eight foreign merchants, not natives of France,
for the payment of this sum; that he should deliver
five hostages till that security was provided; that if
Elizabeth broke the peace with France or Scotland
during that interval, she should forfeit all title to Ca∣lais;
but if Henry made war on Elizabeth, he should
be obliged immediately to restore that fortress<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 505.</NOTE>. All
men of penetration easily saw, that these stipulations
were but a colourable pretence for abandoning Calais;
but they excused the Queen on account of the necessity
of her affairs, and they even extolled her prudence, in
submitting, without further struggle, to that necessity.
A peace with Scotland was a necessary consequence of
that with France.</P>
<P>PHILIP and Henry concluded hostilities with a mu∣tual
restitution of all places taken during the course of
the war; and Philip espoused the princess Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of France, formerly betrothed to his son
Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret,
Henry's sister, and obtained a restitution of all his do∣minions
of Savoy and Piedmont, except a few towns,
retained by France. And thus general tranquillity seem∣ed
to be restored to Europe.</P>
<P>BUT tho' a peace was signed and concluded between
France and England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgust be∣tween the Queen, and Mary Queen of Scots.</NOTE> there soon appeared a ground of
quarrel, of the most serious nature, and which was after∣wards
attended with the most important consequences.
The two marriages of Henry the eighth, that with Cathe∣rine
of Arragon, and that with Anne Boleyn, were to∣tally
incompatible with each other, and it seemed im∣impossible
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
that both of them could be regarded as va∣lid
and legal: But still the birth of Elizabeth lay under
some disadvantages, to which that of her sister, Mary,
was not exposed. Henry's first marriage had obtained
the sanction of all the powers, both civil and ecclesi∣astical,
which were then acknowledged in England;
and it was natural, for protestants as well as Roma∣nists,
to allow, on account of the sincere intention of
the parties, that their issue ought to be regarded as le∣gitimate.
But his divorce, and second marriage,
had been concluded in direct opposition to the see
of Rome; and tho' they had been ratified by the au∣thority
both of the English Parliament and convocation,
those who were strongly attached to the catholic
church, and who reasoned with great strictness,
were lead to regard them as entirely invalid, and to
deny altogether the Queen's right of succession. The
next heir of blood was the Queen of Scots, now mar∣ried
to the dauphin; and the great power of that prin∣cess,
joined to her plausible title, rendered her a very
formidable rival to Elizabeth. The King of France
had secretly been solliciting at Rome a bull of excom∣munication
against the Queen; and she had here been
beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from in∣terest
more than either friendship or principle, had ne∣gociated
in her favour, and had successfully opposed
the pretensions of Henry. But the court of France
was not discouraged with this repulse: The duke of
Guise, and his brothers, thinking, that it would much
augment their credit, if their niece should bring an ac∣cession
of England, as she had already done of Scot∣land,
to the crown of France, engaged the King not to
neglect the claim; and, by their persuasion, he ordered
his son and daughter-in-law to assume openly the arms
as well as title of England, and to quarter these arms
on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
the English ambassador complained of this injury, he
could obtain nothing but an evasive answer; that as
the Queen of Scots was descended from the blood royal
of England, she was entitled, by the example of many
princes, to assume the arms of that kingdom. But be∣sides
that this practice had never prevailed without per∣mission
being first obtained, and without making a vi∣sible
difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly
saw, that this pretension had not been advanced during
the reign of her sister Mary; and that, therefore, the
King of France intended, on the first opportunity, to
dispute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. Alar∣med
with the danger, she thenceforth conceived a strong
jealousy against the Queen of Scots; and was determi∣ned,
as far as possible, to incapacitate Henry from the
execution of his project. The sudden death of that
monarch, who was killed in a tournament at Paris,
while he was celebrating the espousals of his sister with
the duke of Savoy, altered not her views. Being in∣formed,
that his successor, Francis the second, still con∣tinued
to assume, without reserve, the title of King of
England, she began to consider him and his Queen as
her most mortal enemies; and the present situation of
affairs in Scotland afforded her a favourable opportu∣nity,
both of revenging the injury, and of providing
for her own safety.</P>
<P>THE murder of the cardinal-primate at St. Andrews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE>
had deprived the Scots catholics of a head whose seve∣rity,
courage, and capacity had rendered him extreme∣ly
formidable to the innovators in religion; and the ex∣ecution
of the Laws against heresy began thenceforth to
be much more remiss and gentle. The Queen-regent
governed the Kingdom by prudent and moderate coun∣cils;
and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil
interests of the state to the bigotry or interests of priests,
she deemed it more expedient to temporize, and to
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not
power entirely to repress. When informed of the
death of Edward, and the accession of Mary to the
crown of England, she entertained hopes, that the
Scottish reformers, deprived of the countenance which
they received from that powerful kingdom, would lose
their ardour with their prospect of success, and would
gradually return to the faith of their ancestors. But
the progress and revolutions of religion are little go∣verned
by the usual maxims of civil policy; and the
event much disappointed the regent's expectations. Ma∣ny
of the English preachers, terri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied with the severity
of Mary's government, took shelter in Scotland, where
they found more protection, and a milder administra∣tion;
and while they propagated their theological tenets,
they filled that whole kingdom with a just horror
against the cruelties of the bigotted catholics, and show∣ed
their disciples the fate which they must expect, if
ever their adversaries should attain an uncontrouled au∣thority
over them.</P>
<P>A HIERARCHY, moderate in its acquisitions of pow∣er
and riches, may safely grant a toleration to sectaries;
and the more it debates the fervor of innovators by le∣nity
and liberty, the more securely will it possess those
advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon
it. But where superstition has raised a church to such
an exorbitant height as that of Rome, persecution is
less the result of bigotry in the priests, than of a necessa∣ry
policy; and the rigour of law is the only method of
repelling the attacks of men, who, besides religious
zeal, have so many other motives, derived both from
public and private interest, to engage them on the side
of innovation. But tho' such overgrown hierarchies
may long support themselves by these violent expedi∣ents,
the time comes, when severities tend only to en∣rage
the new sectaries, and make them break thro' all
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
bounds of reason and moderation. This crisis was now
visibly approaching in Scotland; and whoever considers
merely the transactions resulting from it, will be incli∣ned
to throw the blame equally on both parties; who∣ever
enlarges his view, and reflects on the situations,
will observe the necessary progress of human affairs, and
the operation of those principles which are inherent in
human nature.</P>
<P>SOME heads of the reformers in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> such as the
earl of Argyle, his son lord Lorne, the earls of Morton,
and Glencarne, Erskine of Dun, and others, finding the
danger to which they were exposed, and desirous to
propagate their principles, entered privately into a bond
or association; and called themselves the <HI>Congregation</HI>
of the Lord, in contradistinction to the established
church, which they denominated the congregation of
Satan. The tenor of the bond was as follows: “We,
perceiving how Satan, in his members, the anti∣christs
of our time, do cruelly rage, seeking to over∣throw
and to destroy the gospel of Christ and his
congregation, ought, according to our bounden
duty, to strive, in our master's cause, even unto the
death, being certain of the victory in him. We do
therefore promise, before the majesty of God and his
congregation, that we, by his grace, shall with all
diligence continually apply our whole power, sub∣stance,
and our very lives, to maintain, set forward,
and establish the most blessed word of God and his
congregation; and shall labour, by all possible means,
to have faithful ministers, truly and purely to mi∣nister
Christ's gospel and sacraments to his people:
We shall maintain them, nourish them, and defend
them, the whole congregation of Christ, and every
member thereof, by our whole power, and at the
hazard of our lives, against Satan, and all wicked
power, who may intend tyranny and trouble against
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
the said congregation: Unto which holy word and
congregation we do join ourselves; and we forsake
and renounce the congregation of Satan, with all
the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof;
and moreover shall declare ourselves manifestly ene∣mies
theroto, by this faithful promise before God,
testified to this congregation by our subscriptions.
At Edinburgh, the third of December, 1557<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>HAD the subscribers of this zealous league been con∣tented
only to demand a toleration of the new opinions;
however incompatible their pretensions might have been
with the policy of the church of Rome, they would
have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws, enacted
to support an establishment prejudicial to civil society:
But it is plain, that they carried their views much far∣ther;
and their practise immediately discovered the spi∣rit
by which they were actuated. Supported by the
authority which, they thought, belonged to them as the
congregation of the Lord, they ordained that prayers
in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The reformers used at that time King Edward's liturgy in Scotland. Forbes, p. 155.</NOTE> should be used in all the parish
churches of the kingdom; and that preaching, and the
interpretation of the scriptures should be practised in pri∣vate
houses, till God should move the prince to grant pub∣lic
preaching by faithful and true ministers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.</NOTE>. Such bonds
of association are always the forerunners of rebellion;
and this violent invasion of the established religion was
the actual commencement of it.</P>
<P>BEFORE this league was publickly known or avowed,
the clergy, alarmed with the progress of the reforma∣tion,
attempted to recover their lost authority, by a vi∣olent
exercise of power, which tended still farther to
augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Ha∣milton,
the primate, seized Walter Mill, a priest of an
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
irreproachable life, who had embraced the new doc∣trines;
and having tried him at St. Andrews, condem∣ned
him to the flames for heresy. Such general aversi∣on
was discovered to this barbarity, that it was some
time before the bishops could prevail on any one to act
the part of a civil judge, and pronounce the sentence
upon him; and even after the time of his execution
was fixed, all the shops of St. Andrews being shut, no
one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake, and the
primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement.
The man bore the torture with that courage which,
tho' usual on these occasions, always appears astonish∣ing
and supernatural to the multitude: The people, to
express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the
priests, raised a monument of stones on the place of his
execution; and as fast as the stones were removed by or∣der
of the clergy, they were again supplied from the
voluntary zeal of the populace<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 122.</NOTE>. It is in vain for men
to oppose the severest punishments to the united motives
of religion and public applause; and this was the last
barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the pow∣er
to exercise in Scotland.</P>
<P>SOME time after, the people discovered their senti∣ments
in such a manner as was sufficient to prognosti∣cate
to the priests, the fate which was awaiting them.
It was usual on the festival of St. Giles, the tutelar
saint of Edinburgh, to carry in procession the image of
that saint; but the protestants, in order to prevent the
ceremony, found means, on the eve of the festival, to
purloin the statue from the church, and they pleased
themselves with imagining the astonishment and
disappointment of his votaries. The clergy, however,
framed hastily a new image, which, in derision, was cal∣led
by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it
thro' the streets, attended with all the ecclesiastics in the
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
town and neighbourhood. The multitude abstained
from violence so long as the Queen-regent continued
a spectator, but the moment she retired, they invaded
the idol, threw it in the dirt, and broke it in pieces.
The flight and terror of the priests and fryars, who, it
was remarked, deserted, in his greatest distress, the object
of their worship, was the source of universal mockery
and laughter,</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by all these appearances, the congre∣gation
proceeded with alacrity in openly solliciting sub∣scriptions
of their league; and the death of Mary of
England, with the accession of Elizabeth, which hap∣pened
about this time, contributed much to increase
their hopes of final success in their undertaking. They
ventured to present a petition to the regent, craving a
reformation of the church, and of the <HI>wicked, scandalous,</HI>
and <HI>detestable</HI> lives of the prelates and ecclesiasticks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 121.</NOTE>.
They framed a Petition, which they intended to present
to Parliament, and in which, after premising, that they
could not communicate with the damnable idolatry,
and intolerable abuses of the papistical church, they de∣sired,
that the laws against heretics should be executed
by the civil magistrate alone, and that the scripture
should be the sole rule for judging of heresy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 123.</NOTE>. They
even petitioned the convocation, and insisted that prary∣ers
should be said in the vulgar tongue, and that bishops
should be chosen with the consent of the gentry of the
diocese, and priests with the consent of the parishio∣ners<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 78, 81, 82.</NOTE>. The regent prudently temporized between these
parties; and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial
crown for her son-in-law, the dauphin, she was, on
that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to ex∣tremities
with either of them.</P>
<P>BUT after this concession was obtained, she received
orders from France, probably dictated by the haughty
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
spirit of her brothers, to proceed with violence against
the reformers, and to restore the royal authority, by
some signal act of power<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Melvil's Memoirs, p. 24. Jebb, vol. II. p. 446.</NOTE>. She made the most eminent
of the protestant teachers be cited to appear before the
council at Stirling; but when their followers were
marching thither in great multitudes, in order to pro∣tect
and countenance them, she entertained apprehensi∣ons
of an insurrection, and dissipated the people by a
promise<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 127. We shall suggest afterwards some reasons to suspect, that, perhaps, no express promise was given. Calumnies, easily arise during times of faction, especially those of the religious kind, when men think eve∣ry art lawful for promoting their purpose. The congregation in their mani∣festo, where they enumerate all the articles of the regent's mal-administra∣tion, do not reproach her with this breach of promise. It was probably no∣thing but a rumour spread abroad to catch the populace. If the papists have sometimes maintained, that no faith was to be kept with heretics, their adversaries seem also to have thought, that no truth ought to be told of idolaters.</NOTE>, that nothing should be done to the preju∣dice
of the ministers. This promise was violated; and
a sentence passed, by which all the ministers were pro∣nounced
rebels, on account of their not appearing. A
measure, so rash and ill advised, enraged the people, and
made them resolve to resist her authority by force of
arms, and to proceed to extremity against the clergy of
the established religion.</P>
<P>IN this critical time John Knox arrived from Gene∣va,
where he had passed some years in banishment, and
where he had imbibed, from his commerce with Calvin,
the highest fanaticism of his sect, augmented by the na∣tural
ferocity of his own character. He had been invi∣ted
back to Scotland by the leaders of the reformation;
and mounting the pulpit at Perth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th May.</NOTE> during the present
ferment of mens minds, he declaimed with his usual ve∣hemence
against the idolatry and other abominations of
the church of Rome, and incited his audience to exert
their utmost zeal for its subversion. A priest was so im∣prudent,
after this sermon, as to open his repository of
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
images and reliques, and prepare himself to say mass.
The audience, who were wrought up to a disposition
for any furious enterprise, were as much enraged as if
the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them: They
attacked the priest with fury, broke the images in pieces,
tore the pictures, overthrew the altars, scattred about
the sacred vases; and left no implement of idolatrous
worship, as they called it, entire or unbroken. They
thence proceeded with additional numbers, and aug∣mented
rage, to the monasteries of the Grey and Black
friars, which they pillaged in an instant: The Carthu∣sians
underwent the same fate; and the populace, not
content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented
their fury on the buildings, which had been the recep∣ticles
of such abomination; and in a very little time no∣thing
but the walls of these stately edifices were left
standing. The inhabitants of Couper in Fife soon af∣ter
imitated the example<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 121. Knox, p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent, provoked at these violences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars in Scotland.</NOTE> as∣sembled
an army, and prepared to chastise the rebels.
She had about two thousand French under her com∣mand,
with a few Scots troops; and being assisted with
such of the nobility as were well affected to her, she
pitched her camp within ten miles of Perth. Even the
earl of Argyle, and the lord James Stuart, prior of St.
Andrew's, the Queen's natural brother, tho' deeply en∣gaged
with the reformers, attended the regent in this
enterprise, either because they blamed the fury of the po∣pulace,
or hoped by their influence and authority to medi∣ate
some agreement between the parties. The congrega∣tion,
on the other hand, made preparations for defence;
and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the west,
and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gen∣try,
they appeared formidable from their numbers, as well
as from the zeal by which they were animated. They

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
sent an address to the regent, where they plainly insi∣nuated,
that if they were pursued to extremity, by the
cruel beasts, the churchmen, they would have recourse
to foreign powers for assistance; and they subscribed
themselves her faithful subjects in all things not repug∣nant
to God; assuming, at the same time, the name of
the faithful congregation of Christ Jesus<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">s Knox, p. 129.</NOTE>. They ap∣plied
to the nobility attending her, and maintained, that
their past violences were justified by the word of God,
which commands the godly to destroy idolatry, and all
the monuments of it; that tho' all civil authority was
sacred, yet was there a great difference between the au∣thority
and the persons who exercised it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 131.</NOTE>; and that
it ought to be considered whether or not those abomina∣tions,
called by the pestilent papists, religion, and which
they defend by fire and sword, be the true religion of
Christ Jesus. They remonstrated with such of the
Queen's army as had formerly embraced their party, and
told them, “That as they were already reputed trai∣tors
by God, they should likewise be excommunica∣ted
from their society, and from the participation of
the sacraments of the church, which God by his
mighty power had erected among them; whose mi∣nisters
have the same authority which Christ granted
to his apostles in these words, <HI>Whose sins ye shall for∣give
shall be forgiven, and whose sins ye shall retain shall
be retained</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 133.</NOTE>.” We may here see that these new
saints were no less lofty in their pretensions than the an∣cient
hierarchy; and it was therefore no wonder they
were enraged against the latter as their rivals in domi∣nion.
They joined to all these declarations an address to
the established church; and they affixed this title to it.
“To the generation of antichrist, the pestilent prelates
and their <HI>shavelings</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">A contemptuous term for a priest.</NOTE> in Scotland, the congregation of
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
Christ Jesus within the same sayeth.” The tenor of
the manifesto was agreeable to the title. They told the
ecclesiastics, “As ye by tyranny intend not only to de∣stroy
our bodies, but also by the same to hold our
souls in bondage of the devil, subject to idolatry; so
shall we, with all the force and power which God
shall grant unto us, execute just vengeance and pu∣nishment
upon you: Yea, we shall begin that same
war which God commanded Israel to execute
against the Canaanites; that is; contract of peace
shall never be made, till you desist from your open
idolatry, and cruel persecution of God's children.
And in this, in the name of the eternal God, and of
his son, Christ Jesus, whose verity we profess, and
Gospel we have preached, and holy sacraments right∣ly
administred, we signify unto you, to be our in∣tent,
so far as God will assist us to withstand your
idolatry. Take this for warning, and be not decei∣ved<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 85, 86, 87. Knox, p. 134.</NOTE>.” With these outrageous symptoms commen∣ced
that cant, hipocrisy, and fanaticism which long in∣fested
that kingdom; and which, tho' now mollified by
the lenity of the civil power, is still ready to break out
on all occasions.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent, finding such obstinate zeal in
the malecontents, was contented to embrace the coun∣cils
of Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's, and to
form an accommodation with them. She was received
into Perth, which submitted to her on promising an
indemnity of past offences, and engaging not to leave
any French garrison in the place. This capitulation,
it is pretended, was not exactly observed. Some of the
inhabitants were molested on account of the late vio∣lences;
and some companies of Scots soldiers, supposed
to be in French pay, were quartered in the town;
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
which step, tho' taken on a very plausible pretence,
was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the
treaty<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 139.</NOTE>. It is asserted, that the regent, to justify these
measures declared, that princes ought not to have their
promises too strictly urged upon them; nor was any faith
to be kept with heretics: And that for her part, could
she find as good a colour of reason, she would willingly
bereave all these men of their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Spotswood, p. 123.</NOTE>. But
it is no wise likely, that such expressions dropt from this
prudent and virtuous princess. On the contrary, it ap∣pears,
that these violences were very disagreeable to
her; that she was in this particular over-ruled by the
authority of the French counsellors placed about her; and
that she often thought, if the management of these affairs
had been entrusted wholly to herself, she could easily,
without force, have accommodated all differences<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 146. Melvil, p. 29. Knox, p. 225, 228. Lesly, lib. 2. That there was really no violation of the capitulation of Perth, appears from the manifesto of the congregation in Knox, p. 184. where it is not so much as pretended. The companies of Scots soldiers were, probably, in Scots pay, since the congregation complains, that the country was oppressed with taxes to maintain armies. Knox, p. 164, 165. And even if they had been in French pay▪ it were no breach of the capitulation, since they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> national troops, not French. Knox does not say, p. 139, that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or punished for their past offences; but only that they were oppressed with the quartering of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers: And the congregation in their mani∣festo, say only that many of them had fled for fear. This plain detection of the calumny with regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth, may make us suspect a like calumny with regard to the promise pretended not to give sentence against the ministers. The affair lay altogether between the re∣gent and the laird of Dun; and that gentleman, tho' a man of sense and cha∣racter, might be willing to take some general professions for promises. If the Queen, overawed by the power of the congregation, gave such a promise in order to have liberty to proceed to a sentence; how could she expect to have power to execute a sentence so treacherously obtained? And to what purpose could it serve?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE congregation enflamed with their own zeal,
and enraged with these disappointments, remained not
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
long in tranquillity. Even before they left Perth, and
while as yet they had no colour to complain of any vi∣olation
of treaty, they had signed a new covenant, in
which, besides their engagements to mutual defence,
they vowed in the name of God to employ their whole
power in destroying every thing that dishonoured his
holy name; and this covenant was subscribed, among
others, by Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 89. Knox, p. 138.</NOTE>.
These two leaders now desired no better Pretence for
deserting the regent and openly joining their associates,
than the complaints, however doubtful, or rather false,
of her breach of promise. The congregation also, en∣couraged
by this accession of force, gave themselves up
entirely to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at
Crail, Anstruther, and other places in Fife, like depre∣dations,
on the churches, and monasteries with those
formerly committed at Perth and Couper. The regent,
who marched against them with her army, finding
their power so much increased, was glad to conclude a
truce for a few days, and to pass over with her forces to
the Lothians. The reformers besieged and took Perth;
proceeded thence to Stirling, where they exercised their
usual fury; and finding nothing able to resist them,
they bent their march to Edinburgh, the inhabitants of
which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the
congregation against the churches and monasteries,
gladly opened their gates to them. The regent, with
the few forces which remained with her, took shel∣ter
in Dunbar, where she shut herself up, in expec∣tation
of a reinforcement from France.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, she employed her partizans in repre∣senting
to the people the dangerous consequences of this
open rebellion; and she endeavoured to convince them,
that the lord James, under pretence of religion, had
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
formed the scheme of wresting the scepter from the
hands of the sovereign. By these considerations many
were engaged to desert the army of the congregation;
but much more by the want of pay or any means of
subsistance; and the regent, observing the insurgents to
be much weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh,
with a design to suppress them. On the interposition
of the duke of Chatelraut, who still adhered to her, she
agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a
toleration of their religion, and they engaged to commit
no farther depredations on the churches. Soon after
they evacuated the city of Edinburgh; and before they
left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but
they took care to publish only the articles favourable to
themselves, and they were guilty of an imposture, in
adding one to the number, viz. that idolatry shall not
again be erected in any place where it was at that time
suppressed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 153, 154, 155. This author pretends that this article was agreed to verbally, but that the Queen's scribes omitted it in the treaty which was signed. This story is very unlikely, or rather very absurd; and in the mean time it is allowed, that the article is not in the treaty: Nor do the con∣gregation in their subsequent manifesto insist upon it. Knox, p. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN agreement concluded, while men's minds were in
this disposition, could nor be durable; and both sides en∣deavoured
to strenghten themselves as much as possible,
against the ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable.
The regent, having got a reinforcement of 1000 men
from France, began to fortify Leith; and the congrega∣tion
seduced the duke of Chatelraut to their party, who
had long appeared inclined to them, and who was at
last determine by the arirval of his son, the earl of Ar∣ran,
from Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, where he had escaped many dangers,
from the jealousy, as well as bigotry, of Henry and the
duke of Guise. More French troops soon after disem∣barked
under the command of La Brosse, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol∣followed
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
by the bishop of Amiens, and three doctors of
the Sorbonne. These last were supplied with store of
syllogisms, authorities, citations, and scholastic argu∣ments,
which they intended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> oppose to the Scots
preachers, and which, they justly presumed, would ac∣quire
force, and operate conviction on mens minds, by
the influence of the French arms and artillery<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 134. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE constable Montmorency had always opposed the
marriage of the Queen of Scots with the dauphin, and
had foretold, that, by forming such close connexions
with Scotland, the antient league would be dissolved;
and the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign
yoke, would soon become, instead of allies, attached by
interest and inclination, the most inveterate enemies to
the French dominion. But tho' the event seemed now
to have justified the prudence of that aged minister, it is
not impropable, considering the violence of the councils,
by which France was governed, that the insurrection
was esteemed a favourable event; as affording a pre∣tence
for sending over armies, for entirely subduing the
country, for attainting the rebels<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 139. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 13.</NOTE>, and for preparing
means thence to invade England, and support Mary's
title to the crown of that kingdom. The leaders of
the congregation, well acquainted with these views,
were not insensible of their danger, and saw that their
only safety consisted in the vigour and success of their
measures. They were encouraged by the intelligence
received of the sudden death of Henry the second; and
having passed an act from their own authority, de∣priving
the Queen dowager of the regency, and order∣ing
all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom,
they collected forces to put their edict in execution
against them. They became masters again of Edin∣burgh;
but found themselves unable to keep long pos∣possession
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
of that city. Their tumultuary armies, assem∣bled
in haste, and supported by no pay, soon separated
themselves upon the least disaster, or even any delay of
success; and were incapable of resisting such veteran
troops as the French, who were also seconded by some
of the Scots nobility, among whom the earl of Both∣wel
distinguished himself. Hearing that the marquis of
Elbeuf, brother to the regent, was levying a new ar∣my
against them in Germany, they thought themselves
excusable for applying, in this extremity, to the
assistance of England; and as the sympathy of religion,
as well as regard to national liberty, had now counter∣ballanced
the antient animosity against that kingdom,
this measure was the result of inclination no less than
of interest<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Scots lords in their declaration say, “How far we have sought sup∣port of England, or of any other prince, and what just cause we had and have so to do, we shall shortly make manifest unto the world, to the praise of God's holy name, and to the confusion of all those that slander us for so doing: For this we fear not to confess, that, as in this enterprise against the devil, against idolatry and the maintainers of the same, we chiefly and on∣ly seek God's glory to be notified unto men, fin to be punished, and virtue to be maintained; so where power faileth of ourselves, we will seek it, wheresoever God shall offer the same,” Knox, p. 176.</NOTE>. Maitland of Ledington, therefore, and Ro∣bert
Melvil, were secretly dispatched by the Congrega∣tion
to sollicit succours from Elizabeth.</P>
<P>THE wise council of Elizabeth deliberated not long
in assenting to this proposal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interposi∣tion of the Queen in S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots affairs.</NOTE> which concurred so well
with their views and interests. Cecil in particular re∣presented
to the Queen, that the union of the crowns
of Scotland and France, both of them the hereditary
enemies of England, was ever regarded as a very per∣nicious
event; and her father, as well as protector So∣merset,
had employed every expedient, both of war and
negotiation, to prevent it: That the claim, which Ma∣ry
pretended to the crown, rendered the present situa∣tion
of England still more dangerous, and demanded,
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
on the part of the Queen,, the greatest vigilance and pre∣caution:
That the capacity, ambition, and exorbitant
views of the family of Guise, who now entirely govern∣ed
the French councils, were sufficiently known, and
they themselves made no secret of their design to advance
their niece to the throne of England: That deeming
themselves secure of success, they had already, very im∣prudently
and prematurely, taken off the mask: and
Throcmorton, the English ambassador at Paris, sent
over, by every courier, incontestible proofs of their
hostile intentions<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 134, 136, 149, 150, 159, 165, 181, 194, 229, 231, 235—241, 253.</NOTE>: That they only waited till Scot∣land
should be entirely subdued; and having thus depri∣ved
the English of the advantage, resulting from their
situation and naval power, they prepared means for sub∣verting
the Queen's authority: That the zealous catholics
in England, discontented with the present government,
and satisfied with the legality of Mary's title, would bring
them considerable reinforcement, and would disturb
every measure of defence against that formidable power:
That the only expedient for preventing these designs was
to seize the present opportunity, and take advantage of
a like zeal in the protestants of Scotland; nor could
any doubt be entertained with regard to the justice of
a measure, founded on such evident necessity, and di∣rected
only to the ends of self preservation: That tho'
a French war, attended with great expence, seemed the
necessary consequence of supporting the Scots malecon∣tents,
that power, if removed to the continent, could
never be very formidable; and a small disbursement at
present would in the end be found the greatest frugali∣ty:
And that the domestic dissentions of France, which
every day augmented, together with the support of Phi∣lip,
who, notwithstanding all his bigotry and hypocri∣cy,
would never permit the entire conquest of England,
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
were sufficient to secure the Queen against the dange∣rous
ambition and resentment of the house of Guise<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 387. Jebb, vol. I. p. 448. Keith, append. 24.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1560.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH'S propensity to caution and oeconomy
were, tho' with some difficulty<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 454. 460.</NOTE>, overcome by these
powerful motives; and she prepared herself to support
by arms and money the declining affairs of the Congre∣gation
in Scotland. She equiped a fleet, which con∣sisted
of thirteen ships of war; and giving the command
of it to Winter, she sent it to the Firth of Forth: She
named the young duke of Norfolk her lieutenant in the
northern counties, and assembled at Berwic an army
of eight thousand men under the command of lord Gray,
warden of the east and middle marches. Tho' the court
of France, sensible of the danger, offered her to make
immediate restitution of Calais, provided she would not
interpose in the affairs of Scotland; she resolutely told
them, that she never would put an inconsiderable fisher∣town
in competition with the safety of her dominions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 146.</NOTE>;
and she still continued her preparations. She conclu∣ded
a treaty of mutual defence with the congregation,
which was to last during the marriage of the Queen of
Scots with Francis and a year after, and she promised
never to desist till the French had entirely evacuated
Scotland<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 217. Haynes's State Papers, vol. I. p. 153. Rymer. tom. xv. p. 569.</NOTE>. And having thus taken all proper mea∣sures
for success, and received from the Scots six hosta∣ges
for the performance of articles, she ordered her fleet
and army to begin their operations.</P>
<P>THE appearance of Elizabeth's fleet in the Firth ve∣ry
much disconcerted the French army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1560. 15th Janu∣ary.</NOTE> who were at
that time ravaging the county of Fife; and obliged
them to make a circuit by Stirling, in order to reach
Leith, where they shut themselves up, and prepared for
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
defence. The English army, reinforced by 5000
Scots<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. 256, 259.</NOTE>, sat down before Leith; and after two skir∣mishes,
in the former of which, the English had the
advantage, in the latter the French, they began to bat∣ter
the town; and tho' repul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with considerable loss
in a rash and ill conducted assault, they reduced the gar∣rison
to great difficulties. Their distress was augmen∣ted
by two events; the dispersion by a storm of d'El∣beuf's
fleet, which carried a considerable army on
board<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 223.</NOTE>, and the death of the Queen regent, who expi∣red
about this time in the castle of Edinburgh; a wo∣man
endowed with all the capacity which shone forth
in her family, but possessed of much more virtue and
moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other
branches of it. The French, who found it impossible to
subsist for want of provisions, and who saw that the
English were continually reinforced by fresh numbers,
were obliged to capitulate. And the bishop of Valence
and count Randan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th July.</NOTE> plenipotentiaries from France, sign∣ed
a treaty at Edinburgh with Cecil and Dr. Wotton,
whom Elizabeth had sent to Edinburgh for that pur∣pose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement
of Scotland.</NOTE> It was there stipulated, that the French should,
all of them, instantly evacuate Scotland; that the
King and Queen of France and Scotland should thence∣forth
abstain from bearing the arms of England, or assu∣ming
the title of that kingdom; that farther satisfaction
for the injury already done in that particular should be
granted Elizabeth; and that commissioners should meet
to settle this point, or if they could not agree, that the
King of Spain should be arbiter between the crowns.
Besides these stipulations, which regarded England,
some concessions were granted to the Scots, which the
plenipotentiaries, in the name of the King and Queen
of France and Scotland, promised in the treaty with
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
Elizabeth to observe; that an amnesty should be pub∣lished
for all past offences; that none but natives should
be put into any office in Scotland; that the states should
name twenty-four persons, of whom the Queen of Scots
should chuse seven, and the states five, and in the hands
of these twelve should the whole administration be placed
during that Queen's absence; and that Mary should nei∣ther
make peace nor war without consent of the states<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, vol. XV. p. 593. Keith, p. 137. Spotswood, p. 147. Knox, p. 229.</NOTE>.
In order to hasten the execution of this important trea∣ty
Elizabeth sent ships, by which the French forces
were transported into their own country.</P>
<P>THUS all Europe saw, in the first transaction of this
reign, the genius and capacity of the Queen and her
ministers. She discerned at a distance the danger, which
threatened her; and took instantly vigorous measures
to prevent it. Making all the possible advantages of
her situation she proceeded with celerity to a decision;
and was not diverted by any offers, negotiations, or re∣monstrances
of the French court. She stopped not till
she had brought the matter to a final issue; and had
converted that very power, to which her enemies trust∣ed
for her destruction, into her firmest support and se∣curity.
By exacting no improper conditions from the
Scots malecontents even during their greatest distress,
she established an entire confidence with them; and hav∣ing
cemented the union by all the tyes of gratitude, inte∣rest
and religion, she now possessed an influence over
them above what remained even with their native sove∣reign.
The regard which she acquired by this dex∣trous
and spirited conduct, gave her every where, abroad
as well as at home, more authority than had attended
her sister, tho' supported by all the power of the Spa∣nish
monarchy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 354, 372. Jebb, vol. II. p. 452▪</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46"/>
THE subsequent measures of the Scots reformers tend∣ed
still more to cement their union with England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1558.</NOTE>
Being entirely masters of the kingdom they made no far∣ther
ceremony or scruple, in fully effecting their pur∣pose.
In the treaty of Edinburgh it had been agreed,
that a Parliament or convention should soon be assem∣bled;
and the leaders of the Congregation, not wait∣ing
till the Queen of Scots should ratify that treaty,
thought themselves fully intitled, without the sove∣reign's
authority, immediately to summon a Parliament.
The reformers presented a petition to this assembly; in
which they are not contented with desiring the esta∣blishment
of their doctrine; they also apply for the pu∣nishment
of the catholics, whom they call vassals to the
Roman harlot; and they assert, that, amongst all the
rabble of the clergy, such is their expression, there is not
one lawful minister; but that they are, all of them,
thieves and murderers; yea rebels and traitors to civil
authority; and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any
reformed common-wealth<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 237, 238.</NOTE>. The Parliament seem to
have been actuated by the same spirit of rage and perse∣cution.
After ratifying a confession of faith, agreeable
to the new doctrines, they passed a statute against the
mass, and not only abolished it in all the churches, but
enacted, that whoever any where, either officiated in it
or was present at it, should be chastised, for the first of∣fence,
with confiscation of goods, and corporal punish∣ment,
at the discretion of the magistrate; for the se∣cond,
with banishment; and for the third, with loss of
life<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 254.</NOTE>. A law was also voted for abolishing the papal
jurisdiction in Scotland: The presbyterian form of dis∣cipline
was settled, leaving only at first some shadow of
authority to certain ecclesiafsics, whom they called su∣perintendants.
The prelates of the antient faith ap∣peared
in order to complain of great injustice committed

on them by the invasion of their property, but the Par∣liament
took no notice of them; till at last, these ecclesi∣astics,
tired with fruitless attendance, departed the town.
They were then cited to appear; and as no body presen∣ted
themselves, it was voted by the Parliament, that the
ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied, and found no reason
of complaint.</P>
<P>SIR James Sandilands, prior of St. John, was sent
over to France to obtain the ratification of these acts;
but was very ill received by the Queen, who absolute∣ly
denied the validity of a Parliament, summoned with∣out
the royal consent; and she refused her sanction to
these statutes. But the protestants gave themselves lit∣tle
concern about their Queen's refusal. They imme∣diately
put the statutes in execution: They abolished
the mass; they settled their ministers; they committed
every where furious devastations on the monasteries,
and even on the churches, which they thought to be
profaned by idolatry; and deeming the property of the
clergy lawful prey, they took possession, without cere∣mony,
of the far greater part of the ecclesiastical reve∣nues.
Their new preachers, who had authority suffi∣cient
to incite them to war and insurrection, could not
restrain their rapacity; and fanaticism concurring with
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arice, an incurable blow was given to the papal au∣thority
in that country. The protestant nobility and
gentry, united by the consciousness of such unpardona∣ble
guilt, alarmed for their new possessions, well ac∣quainted
with the imperious character of the house of
Guise, saw no safety for themselves but in the protec∣tion
of England; and they dispatched Morton, Glen∣carne,
and Ledington to express their sincere gratitude
to the Queen for her past favours, and to represent to
her the necessity of continuing them.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH had equal reason to maintain an union
with the Scots protestants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af∣fairs.</NOTE> and soon found, that the
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
house of Guise, notwithstanding their past disappoint∣ments,
had not laid aside the design of contesting her ti∣tle,
and subverting her authority. Francis and Mary,
whose councils were wholly directed by them, refused
to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh; and showed no dispo∣sition
to give her any satisfaction for that mortal inju∣ry
and affront which they had put upon her, by so
openly assuming the title and arms of England. She
was sensible of the danger attending such pretensions;
and it was with pleasure she heard of the violent factions,
which prevailed in the French government, and of the
opposition, which had arisen against the measure sof the
duke of Guise. That ambitious prince, supported by
his four brothers, the cardinal of Lorraine, the duke of
Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,
men no less ambitious than himself, had engrossed all
the authority of the crown: and as he was possessed of
every quality, which could command the esteem or se∣duce
the affections of men, there appeared no end of his
acquisitions and pretensions. The constable Montmo∣rency,
who had long ballanced his credit, was depri∣ved
of all power: The princes of the blood, the King
of Navarre and his brother the prince of Condé, were
entirely excluded from offices and favour: The Queen∣mother
herself, Catherine de Medicis, found her influ∣ence
every day declining: And as Francis, a young
prince, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly go∣verned
by his spouse, who knew no law but the plea∣sure
of her uncles, men despaired of ever obtaining free∣dom
from the dominion of that aspiring family. It
was the contests of religion, which first inspired the
French with courage openly to oppose their exorbitant
authority.</P>
<P>THE theological disputes, first started in the north of
Germany, and next in Switzerland, countries at that
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
time wholly illiterate, had long ago penetrated into
France; and as they were assisted by the general discon∣tents
against the court and church of Rome, and by the
zealous spirit of the age, the proselytes to the new reli∣ligion
were secretly encreasing in every province. Hen∣ry
the second, in imitation of his father Francis, had op∣posed
the progress of the reformers; and tho' a prince
addicted to pleasure and society, he was transported by
a vehemence, as well as bigotry, which had little place
in his predecessor's conduct. Rigorous punishments had
been inflicted on the most eminent of the protestant par∣ty;
and a point of honour seemed to have arisen, whe∣ther
the one sect could exercise or the other suffer most
barbarity. The death of Henry put some stop to the
persecutions; and the people, who had admired the con∣stancy
of the new preachers, now heard with favour
and prepossession their arguments and doctrines. But
the cardinal of Lorrain, as well as his brother, who
were possessed of the legal authority, thought it their
interest to support the established religion; and when
they revived the exercise of the penal statutes, they ne∣cessarily
engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in
the protection of the new religion. The King of Na∣varre,
a man of mild dispositions, but of a weak charac∣ter,
and the prince of Condé, who possessed many heroic
qualities, having declared themselves in favour of the
protestants, that sect acquired new force from their
countenance; and the admiral de Coligni, with his bro∣ther
Andelot, no longer scrupled to declare themselves
openly of their communion. The integrity of the ad∣miral,
who was believed sincere in his profession, and
his high renown both for valour and conduct, for the
arts of peace as well as of war, gave credit to the re∣formers;
and after a frustrated attempt of the malecon∣tents
to seize the King's person at Amboise, of which
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
Elizabeth had probably some intelligence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 214. Throcmorton▪ about this time, unwilling to en∣trust to letters the great secrets committed to him, obtained leave, under some pretext, to come over to London.</NOTE>, every place
was full of distraction, and matters hastened to an ex∣tremity
between the parties. But the house of Guise,
tho' these factions had obliged them to remit their ef∣forts
in Scotland, and had been one chief cause of Eli∣zabeth's
success, were determined not to relinquish
their authority in France, or yield to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olence of
their antagonists. They found an opportunity to seize
the King of Navarre and the prince of Condé; they
threw the former into prison; they obtained a sentence
of death against the latter; and they were proceeding to
put the sentence in execution, when the king's sudden
death saved the noble prisoner, and interrupted the pros∣perity
of the duke of Guise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 December. 1561.</NOTE> The Queen-mother was
appointed regent to her son Charles the ninth, now in
his minority: The King of Navarre was named lieu∣tenant-general
of the kingdom: The sentence against
Condé was annulled: The constable was recalled to
court: And the family of Guise, tho' they still enjoyed
great offices, and great power, now found a counter∣poise
to their authority.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was not dissatisfied to learn, that her
avowed enemies had met with so severe a check, and she
determined to make advantage of it against the Queen
of Scots, whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival.
She saw herself freed from the perils attending an uni∣on
of Scotland with France; and was pleased to find,
that so powerful a prince as the French monarch was
no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdom. But
she considered, on the other hand, that the English ca∣tholics,
who were very numerous, and who were gene∣rally
prejudiced in favour of Mary's title, would now
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1561.</NOTE>
when they saw, that her succession no longer endanger∣ed
the liberties of the kingdom, and was rather attended
with the advantages of producing an entire union with
Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her ambassa∣dor,
Throcmorton, a very vigilant and able minister, to
renew his applications to the Queen of Scots, and to
require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh. But
tho' Mary had desisted, after her husband's death, from
bearing the arms and title of Queen of England, she still
declined gratifying Elizabeth in this momentous arti∣cle;
and hearkening too much to the ambitious sug∣gestions
of her uncles, she refused to make any formal
renunciation of her pretensions.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Queen-mother of France, who
imputed to Mary all the mortifications which she had
met with during Francis's life-time, took care to retali∣ate
on her by like injuries; and the Queen of Scots,
who foun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her abode in France disagreeable, began
to think of returning into her native country. Lord
James, who had been sent in deputation from the states
to invite her over, seconded this intention; and she ap∣plied
to Elizabeth, by D'Oisel, for liberty to pass thro'
England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 175.</NOTE>. But she received for answer, that till she
had given satisfaction, by ratifying the treaty of Edin∣burgh,
she could expect no favour from a person whom
she had so much injured. This denial excited her re∣sentment;
and she made no scruple of expressing her sen∣timents
to Throcmorton, when he reiterated his ap∣plications
to gratify his mistress in a demand, which he
represented as so reasonable. Having cleared the room
of all her attendants, she said to him, “How weak I
“may prove, or how far a woman's frailty may trans∣port
me, I cannot tell: However, I have no mind to
have so many witnesses of my infirmity as you mis∣tress
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
had at her audience of my ambassador D'Oi∣sel.
There is nothing disturbs me so much, as the
having asked, with so much importunity, a favour
which it was of no consequence for me to obtain. I
can, with God's leave, return to my own country
without her leave; as I came to France, in spite of
all the opposition of her brother, King Edward:
Neither do I want friends, both able and willing to
conduct me home, as they have brought me hither;
tho' I was desirous rather to make an experiment of
her friendship than of the assistance of any other per∣son.
I have often heard you say, that a good cor∣respondence
between her and myself would conduce
much to the security and happiness of both our king∣doms:
But were she well convinced of this truth,
she had hardly denied me so small a request. But,
perhaps, she bears a better inclination to my rebel∣lious
subjects than to me, their sovereing, her equal
in royal dignity, her near relation, and the undoubt∣ted
heir of her kingdoms. Besides her friendship, I
ask nothing at her hands: I neither trouble her, nor
concern myself in the affairs of her State: Not that
I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great
many malecontents, who are no friends to the pre∣sent
establishment. She is pleased to upbraid me as a
person little experienced in the world: I freely own
it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am
old enough to acquit myself honestly and courteously
to my friends and relations, and to encourage no re∣ports
of her, which would misbecome a Queen and
her kinswoman. I would also say, by her leave,
that I am a Queen as well as she, and not altogether
friendless: And, perhaps, I have as great a soul too;
so that methinks we should be upon a level in
our treatment of each other. As soon as I have
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
consulted the states of my kingdom, I shall be ready
to give a reasonable answer; and I am the more in∣tent
on my journey, in order to make the quicker
dispatch in this affair. But she, it seems, intends to
stop my journey; so that either she will not let me
give her satisfaction, or is resolved not to be satified;
perhaps, on purpose to keep up the disagreement be∣twixt
us. She had often reproached me with my be∣ing
young; and I must be very young, indeed, and
as ill advised, to treat of matters of such great concern
and importance, without the advice of my Parlia∣ment.
I have not been wanting in any friendly
offices to her; but she disbelieves or overlooks them.
I could heartily wish, that I was as near allied to
her in affection as in blood: For that, indeed, would
be a most valuable alliance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Caballa, p. 374. Spotswood, p. 177.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>SUCH a spirited reply, notwithstanding the obliging
terms interspersed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate
friendship between these rival princesses, or cure those
mutual jealousies which had already taken place. Eli∣zabeth
equipped a fleet, on pretence of pursuing py∣rates,
but probably with an intention of intercepting the
Queen of Scots in her return homewards. Mary em∣barked
at Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th August.</NOTE> and passing the English fleet in a fog,
arrived safely at Leith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of Mary in Scotland.</NOTE> attended by her three uncles,
the duke of Aumale, the grand prior, and the marquess
of Elbeuf, together with the marquess of Damville, and
other French courtiers. This change of abode and si∣tuation
was very little agreeable to that princess. Be∣sides
the natural prepossessions in favour of a country
in which she had been educated from her earliest infan∣cy,
and where she had borne so high a rank, she could
not forbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> regreting her departure from among that
people, so celebrated for their humane and sociable dis∣position,
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
and their respectsul attachment to their so∣vereign,
and reflecting on the disparity of the scene
which lay before her. It is said, tat after she was em∣barked
at Calais, she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of
France, and never turned them from that beloved ob∣ject,
till darkness fell, and intercepted it from her view.
She then ordered a couch to be spread for her under the
open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning
the land was still in sight, he should awake her, and afford
her one parting view of that country in which all her
affections were centered. The weather proved very
calm, so that the ship made little way in the night-time:
And Mary had once more an opportunity of seeing the
French coast. She sat up on her couch, and still look∣ing
towards the land, often repeated these words:
“Farewell, France, farewell; I shall never see thee
more<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179. Jebb, vol. II. p. 483.</NOTE>.” The first aspect, however, of things in Scot∣land,
was more favourable, if not to her pleasure and
happiness, at least to her repose and security, than she
had reason to apprehend. No sooner did the French
gallies appear off Leith, than people of all ranks, who
had long expected their arrival, flocked towards the
shore, with an earnest impatience to behold and receive
their young sovereign. Some were led by duty, some
by interest, some by curiosity; and all combined to ex∣press
their attachment to her, and to insinuate them∣selves
into her confidence, on the commencement of
her administration. She had now reached the nine∣teenth
year of her age; and the bloom of her youth, and
amiable beauty of her person, were farther recommend∣ed
by the affability of her address, the politeness of her
manners, and the elegance of her genius. Well ac∣complished
in all the superficial, but engaging graces
of a court, she afforded, when better known, still more
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
promising indications of her character; and men prog∣nosticated
both humanity from her soft and obliging de∣portment,
and penetration from her taste in all the refi∣ned
arts of music, eloquence, and poetry<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Buchan, lib. xvii. c. 9. Spotswood, p. 178, 179. Keith, p. 180. Thuan. lib. xxix. c. 2.</NOTE>. And as the
Scots had long been deprived of the presence of their so∣vereign,
whom they once despaired ever more to behold
among them, her arrival seemed to give universal satis∣faction;
and nothing appeared about the court, but
symptoms of affection, joy, and festivity.</P>
<P>THE first measures which Mary embraced, confirmed
all the prepossessions which had been entertained in her
favour. She followed the advice which she had receiv∣ed
in France from D'Oisel and the bishop of Ami∣ens,
as well as her uncles; and gave her confidence en∣tirely
to the leaders of the reformed party, who had
greatest influence on the people, and who, she found,
were alone able to support her government. Her bro∣ther,
lord James, whom she soon after created earl of
Murray, obtained the chief authority; and after him,
Lidington, secretary of state, a man of great sagacity,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a principal share in her confidence. By the vigour
of these mens measures she endeavoured to restore or∣der
and police in the country, divided by public fac∣tions
and private feuds; and that fierce and intractable
people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, seemed,
for a time, to submit peaceably to her gentle and pru∣dent
administration.</P>
<P>BUT there was one circumstance which blasted all
these promising appearances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigotry of the Scots reformers.</NOTE> and bereaved Mary of
that general favour which her agreeable manners and
prudent deportment gave her just reason to expect. She
was still a papist; and tho' she published, soon after her
arrival, a proclamation, requiring every one to submit
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
to submit to the established religion, the preachers, and
their adherents, could neither be reconciled to a per∣son
polluted with so great an abomination, nor lay aside
their jealousies of her future conduct. It was with
great difficulty she could obtain permission for mass in
her own chappel; and had not the people apprehend∣ed,
that if she had here met with a refusal, she would
instantly have returned to France, the zealots never
would have granted her even that small indulgence.
The cry was, “Shall that idol be suffered again to be
erected within the realm?” It was asserted in the pul∣pit,
that one mass was more terrible than ten thousand
armed men landed to invade the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 287.</NOTE>: Lord Lin∣des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
and the gentlemen of Fife, exclaimed,” That
the idolater should die the death;” such was their ex∣pression.
One that carried tapers for the ceremony of
that worship, was attacked and insulted in the court of
the palace. And if the lord James, and some popular
leaders, had not interposed, the most dangerous uproar
was justly apprehended, from the ungoverned fury of
the multitude<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 284, 285, 287. Spotswood, p. 179.</NOTE>. The usual prayers in the churches
were to this purpose: That God would turn her heart,
which was obstinate against him and his truth; or if
his holy will be otherwise, that he would strengthen the
hearts and <HI>hands</HI> of the elect, stoutly to oppose the rage
of all tyrants<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179.</NOTE>. Nay, it was openly called in que∣stion,
whether that princess, being an idolatress, was
entitled to any authority, even in civil matters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The helpless Queen was every moment exposed to
contumely, which she bore with benignity and pati∣ence.
Soon after her arrival she dined in the castle of
Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy,
six years of age should be let down from the roof, and
should present her with a bible, a psalter, and the keys
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
of the castle. Lest she should be at a loss to under∣stand
this insult on her as a papist, all the decorations
expressed the burning of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram,
and other punishments inflicted by God against idola∣try<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 189. Buchan. lib. xvii. c. 20.</NOTE>. The town council of Edinburgh had the assu∣rance,
from their own authority, to issue a Proclamation
banishing from their district, “all the wicked rabble of
“antichrist the pope, such as priests, monks, friars, to∣gether
with adulterers and fornicatots<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 192. Haynes, vol. I. p. 372.</NOTE>.” And be∣cause
the privy-council suspended the magistrates for
their insolence, the passionate historians<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 292.</NOTE> of that age
have inferred, that the Queen was engaged, by a sym∣pathy
of manners, to take adulterers and fornicators
under her protection. It appears probable, that the
magistrates were afterwards reinstated in their office,
and that their proclamation was confirmed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT all the insolence of the people was nothing in
comparison of that which was exercised by the clergy
and the preachers; and they took a pride in vilifying,
even to her face, this amiable princess. The assembly
of the church framed an address, in which, after tel∣ling
her, that her mass was a bastard service of God, the
fountain of all impiety, and the source of every evil
which abounded in the realm; they discovered their ex∣pectations,
that she would, ere this time, have prefer∣ed
truth to her own pre-conceived opinion, and have
renounced her religion, which, they assured her, was
nothing but abomination and vanity. They said, that the
present abuses of government were so enormous, that if a
speedy remedy was not provided, God would not fail in
his anger to strike the head and the tail, the disobedient
prince and sinful people. They required, that severe
punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and forni∣cators;
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
and they concluded with demanding for them∣selves,
some addition both of power and property<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 311, 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE ringleader in all these insults on majesty was
John Knox, who possessed an uncontrouled authority
in the church, and even in the civil affairs of the nati∣on,
and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of
his sovereign. His usual appellation for the Qeeen was
Jezabel; and tho' she endeavoured, by the most gra∣cious
condescension, to win his favour, all her insinua∣tions
could gain nothing on his obdurate heart. She
promised him access to her whenever he demanded it;
and she even desired him, if he found her blameable in
any thing, to reprehend her freely in private, rather
than vilify her in the pulpit before all the people;
but he plainly told her, that he had a publick mi∣nistry
entrusted to him, that if she would come to
church, she should there hear the gospel of truth, and
that it was not his business to apply to every in∣dividual,
nor had he leisure for that occupation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 310.</NOTE>.
The political principles of the man, which he com∣municated
to his brethren, were as full of sedition as
his theological were of rage and bigotry. Tho' he
once condescended so far as to tell the Queen, that
he would submit to her, in the same manner that Paul
did to Nero<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 288.</NOTE>; he remained not long in this dutiful
strain. He said to her, that “Samuel feared not to slay
Agag, the fat and delicate King of Amalek, whom
King Saul had saved: Neither spared Elias Jezabel's
false prophets, and Baal's priests, tho' King Ahab was
present. Phineas,” added he, “was no magistrate;
and yet feared he not to strike Cosbie and Zimri in
the very act of filthy fornication. And so, madam,
your grace may see, that others than chief magistrates
may lawfully inflict punishment on such crimes as
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
are condemned by the law of God<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 326.</NOTE>.” Knox had for∣merly,
during the reign of Mary of England, wrote a
book against female succession to the crown: The ti∣tle
of it is, <HI>The first blast of the trumpet against the mon∣strous
regimen of women.</HI> He was too proud either to
recant the tenets of this book, or even to apologize for
them; and his conduct shewed, that he thought no
more civility than loyalty was due to any of the female
sex.</P>
<P>THE whole life of Mary, from the demeanour of
these men, was filled with bitterness and sorrow. This
rustic apostle scruples not, in his history, to inform us,
that he once treated her with such severity, that she
lost all command of her temper, and dissolved into tears
before him: Yet so far from being moved with youth,
and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to that conditi∣on,
he persevered in his insolent reproofs; and when
he relates this incident, he even discovers a visible pride
and satisfaction in his own conduct<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 332, 333.</NOTE>. The pulpits
had become nothing but scenes of railing against the vi∣ces
of the court; among which were always noted as
the principal, feasting, finery, dancing, balls, and
whoredom, their necessary attendant<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 322.</NOTE>. Some orna∣ments,
which the ladies at that time wore upon their
petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the
preachers, and they affirmed, that such vanity would pro∣voke
God's vengeance, not only against these foolish
women, but against the whole realm<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 330.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY, whose age, condition, and education invited her
to liberty and chearfulness, was curbed in every amuse∣ment,
by the absurd severity of these reformers; and she
found each moment reason to regret her leaving that coun∣try
from whose manners she had in her early youth recei∣ved
the first impressions<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 294.</NOTE>. Her two uncles, the duke
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
of Aumale, and the grand prior, with the other French
nobility, soon took their leave of her: The marquess of
Elbeuf remained some time longer; but after his depar∣ture,
she was left alone to the society of her own sub∣jects;
men at that time unacquainted with the plea∣sures
of conversation, ignorant of arts and civility, and
corrupted beyond their usual rusticity by a dismal fana∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ism,
which rendered them incapable of all humanity
or improvement. Tho' she had made no attempt to
restore the antient religion, her popery was a sufficient
crime: Tho' her behaviour was hitherto irreproacha∣ble,
and her manners sweet and engaging, her gaiety
and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity.
And to the harsh and preposterous usage which this prin∣cess
met with, may, in part, be ascribed those errors of
her subsequent conduct, which seemed to be so little
of a piece with the general tenor of her character.</P>
<P>THERE happened to the marquess of Elbeuf, before
his departure, an adventure which, tho' frivolous, might
enable him to give Mary's friends in France, a very
melancholy idea of her situation. This nobleman,
with the earl of Bothwel, and some other young cour∣tiers,
had been engaged, after a debauch to pay a visit
to a woman called Alison Craig, who was known to be
liberal of her favours; and because they were denied en∣trance,
they broke the windows, thrust open the door,
and committed some disorders, in searching for the
damsel. It happened that the assembly of the church
was sitting at that time, and they immediately took
the matter under their cognizance. In conjunction
with several of the nobility, they presented an address
to the Queen, which was introduced with this awful
prelude. “To the Queen's majesty, and to her secret
and great council, her grace's faithful and obedient
subjects, the professors of Christ Jesus's holy evangil,
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
with the spirit of righteous judgment.” The tenor
of the petition was, that the fear of God, the duty
which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatnings
denounced by God against every city or country where
horrible crimes are openly committed, compelled them
to demand the severe punishment of such as had done
what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God against
the whole realm: That the inquity of which they com∣plained,
was so heinous, and so horrible, that they
should esteem themselves accomplices in it, if they had
been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance,
to pass it over in silence, or bury it in oblivion: That
as they owed her grace obedience in the administration
of justice, so were they entitled to require of her, in
return, the sharp and condign punishment of this enor∣mity,
which, they repeated it, might draw down the
vengeance of God on the whole kingdom: And that
they insisted on it to be her duty to lay aside all private
affections towards the actors in this heinous crime and
enormous villainy, and without delay bring them to a
trial, and inflict the severest penalties upon them. The
Queen gave a gracious reception to this peremptory ad∣address;
but because she probably thought, that break∣ing
the windows of a brothel merited not such severe
reprehension, she only replied, that her uncle was a
stranger, and that he was attended with a young com∣pany:
But she would put such order to him and to all
others, that her subjects should henceforth have no rea∣son
to complain. Her passing over this incident so
slightly, was the source of great discontent, and was re∣garded
as a proof of the most prostigate manners<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 302, 303, 304. Keith, p. 509.</NOTE>. It
is not to be omitted, that Alison Craig, the cause of all
the uproar, was known to entertain a commerce with
the earl of Arran, who, on account of his great zeal

for the reformation, was, without scruple, indulged in
that enormity<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Knox. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the
Queen's chappel during her absence, and committed
some outrages; for which two of them were indicted,
and it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox
wrote circular letters to the most considerable zealots
of the party, and charged them to appear in town, and
protect their brethren. The holy sacraments, he there
said, are abused by prophane papists; the mass has been
said; and in worshiping that idol, the priests have omit∣ted
no ceremony, not even the conjuring of their ac∣cursed
water, that had ever been practised in the time
of the greatest blindness. These violent measures for
opposing justice differed little from rebellion; and Knox
was summoned before the council to answer for his
offence. The courage of this man was equal to his
insolence. He scrupled not to tell the Queen, that
the pestilent papists, who had enflamed her against these
holy men, were the sons of the devil; and must there∣fore
obey the directions of their father, who had been a
liar and a manslayer from the beginning. The mat∣ter
ended with the full acquital of Knox<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 336, 342.</NOTE>. Randolf,
the English ambassador in Scotland at this time, had
reason to write to Cecil, speaking of the Scots nation:
“I think marvelously of the wisdom of God, that gave
this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome people no
more power nor substance: For they would other∣wise
run wild<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 202.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WE have related these circumstances at greater
length, than the necessity of our subject may seem to re∣quire:
But even trivial incidents, which show the man∣ners
of the age, are often more instructive, as well as
entertaining, than the great transactions of wars and
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
negotiations, which are nearly similar in all periods and
and in all countries of the world.</P>
<P>THE reformed clergy in Scotland had, at that time,
a very natural reason for their ill humour, viz. the po∣verty
or rather beggary to which they were reduced:
The nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands
on all the property of the regular clergy, without ma∣king
any provision for the friars and nuns, whom they
turned out of all their possessions. The secular cler∣gy
of the catholic communion, tho' they lost all eccle∣siastical
jurisdiction, still held some of the temporalities
of their benefices; and either became laymen themselves,
and converted them into perpetual property, or made
conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility, who
thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church.
The new teachers had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the
voluntary oblations of the faithful; and in a poor coun∣try,
divided in religious sentiments, this establishment
was regarded as very scanty and very precarious. Re∣peated
applications were made for a legal settlement
to the preachers; and tho' almost every thing in the
kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was
with difficulty that their request was at last complied
with. The fanatical spirit which they indulged, and
their industry in decrying the principles and practices
of the romish communion, which placed such a merit
in enriching the clergy, proved now a very sensible ob∣stacle
to their acquisitions. The boundaries of the roy∣al
power were, during that age, more uncertain in
Scotland than even in England; and the privy coun∣cil
alone thought themselves intitled, without a Parlia∣ment,
to regulate this important matter. They passed
a vote<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 296. Keith, p. 210.</NOTE>, by which they divided all the ecclesiastical be∣nefices
into twenty one parts: They assigned fourteen
to the antient possessors: Of the remaining seven, they
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
granted three to the crown; and if that was sound to
answer the public expences, they bestowed the over∣plus
on the reformed ministers. The Queen was em∣powered
to levy all the seven; and it was ordained,
that she should afterwards pay to the clergy what should
be judged to suffice for their maintenance. The ne∣cessities
of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and
the small affection which Mary bore to the proto∣stant
ecclesiastics, rendered their revenues very con∣temptible
as well as uncertain; and the preachers, find∣ing
that they could not rival the gentry, nor even the
middling rank of men in opulence and plenty, were
necessitated to betake themselves to other expedients for
supporting their authority. They affected a furious
zeal for religion, morose manners, a vulgar and famili∣ar,
and yet mysterious, cant; and tho' the liberality of
subsequent princes put them afterwards on a better
footing with regard to revenue and thereby corrected
in some degree these vicious habits; it must be confessed
that, while many other advantages attend presbyterian
government, these inconveniencies are not easily sepa∣rated
from the genius of that ecclesiastical polity.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots, destitute of all force, possessing
a narrow revenue, surrounded with a factious turbu∣lent
nobility, a bigoted people, and insolent ecclesias∣tics,
soon found, that her only expedient fot maintain∣ing
tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence
with<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 456.</NOTE> Elizabeth, who by former engagements and ser∣vices,
had acquired such authority over all these ranks
of men. Soon after her arrival in Scotland, secretary
Lidington was sent to London, in order to pay her
compliments to the Queen, and express her desire of
friendship and a good correspondence; and he received
a commission from her, as well as from the Scots
nobility, to demand, as a means of cementing this
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
friendship, that Mary should, by act of Parliament or
by Proclamation (for the difference between these se∣curities
was not then deemed very considerable) be de∣clared
successor to the crown. No request could be
more unreasonable, nor made at a more improper
juncture. The Queen replied, that Mary had once
discovered her intention not to wait for the succession,
but had openly, without ceremony or reserve, assumed
the title of Queen of England, and had pretended supe∣rior
right to her throne and kingdom: That tho' her
ambassadors, and those of her husband, the French King,
had signed a treaty, in which they renounced that claim,
and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity, she
was so intoxicated with this imaginary right, that she
had rejected the most earnest sollicitations, and even, as
some endeavoured to persuade her, incurred some dan∣ger
in crossing the seas rather than ratify that equita∣ble
treaty: That her partizans every where had still
the assurance to insist on her title, and had presumed to
talk of her own birth as spurious and illegitimate: That
while affairs were on this footing; while a claim thus
openly made, so far from being openly renounced, was
only suspended till a more convenient opportunity; it
would in her be the most egregious imprudence to for∣tify
the hands of a pretender to her crown, by decla∣ring
her the successor: That no expedient could be
worse imagined for cementing friendship than such a
declaration, and Kings were often found to bear no
good will to their successors, even tho' their own chil∣dren;
much more when the connexion was so much less
intimate, and when such cause of disgust and jealousy
had been already given, and indeed was still continued,
on the part of Mary: That tho' she was willing, from
the amity which she bore her kinswoman, to ascribe
her former pretensions to the advice of others, by whose
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
direction she was then governed; her refusal to relin∣quish
them could proceed only from her own prepossessi∣ons,
and were a proof that she still retained some dan∣gerous
project against her: That it was the nature of
all men to be disgusted with the present, to entertain
flattering views of futurity, to think their services ill
rewarded, to expect a better recompence from the suc∣cessor;
and she should esteem herself scarce half a sove∣reign
over the English, if they saw her declare her heir,
and arm her rival with authority against her own re∣pose
and safety: That she knew the inconstant nature
of the people; she was acquainted with the present di∣visions
in religion; she was not ignorant, that the same
party, which expected greatest favour during the reign
of Mary, did also imagine, that the title of that princess
was superior to her own: That for her part, whatever
claims were advanced, she was determined to live and
die Queen of England; and after her death, it was the
business of others to examine who had the best preten∣sions,
either by the laws or by right of blood, to the
succession: That she hoped the Queen of Scots's claim
would then be found preferable; and considering the
injury, which she herself had received, it was suffici∣ent
indulgence, if she promised, in the mean time, to
do nothing which might, in any respect, weaken or in∣validate
that claim: And that Mary, if her title was re∣ally
superior, a point, which, for her own part, she had
never inquired into, possessed all advantages above her
rivals; who, destitute both of present power, and of all
support by friends, would only expose themselves to
inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubt∣ful
pretensions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Buchanan. lib. xvii. c. 14—17. Camden. p. 385. Spotswood, p. 180. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views of the Queen were so prudent and ju∣dicious,
that there was no likelihood of her ever de∣parting
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
from them: But that she might put the matter
to a fuller proof, she offered to explain the words of
the treaty of Edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion on
their excluding Mary's right of succession<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 181.</NOTE>; and in this
form, she again required her to ratify that treaty. Mat∣ters
at last came to this issue, that Mary agreed to the
proposal, and offered to renounce all present pretensi∣ons
to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would
agree to declare her the successor<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 377.</NOTE>. But such was the
jealous character of this latter princess, that she never
would consent to strengthen the interest and authority of
any claimant, by fixing the succession; much less would
she make this concession in favour of a rival Queen,
who possessed such plausible pretensions for the present,
and who, tho' she might verbally resign them, could
ealsiy resume her title on the first opportunity. Ma∣ry's
proposal, however, bore so specious an appearance
of equity and justice, that Elizabeth, sensible that rea∣son
would be deemed to lie entirely on that side, made
no more mention of the matter; and tho' no farther
concessions were made by either Princess, they put on
all the appearances of a cordial reconcilement and
friendship with each other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wise go∣vernment of Elizabeth.</NOTE> The Queen observed, that,
even without her interposition, Mary was sufficiently
depressed by the mutinous disposition of her own sub∣jects;
and instead of giving Scotland, for the present,
any inquietude or disturbance, she employed herself,
much more usefully and laudibly, in regulating the af∣fairs
of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness
of her people. She made some progress in paying those
great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>debtd which lay upon the crown; she regulated
the coin, which had been extremely debased by her
predecessors; she furnished her arsenals with great
quantities of arms from Germany and other places; en∣gaged
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
her nobility and gentry to imitate her example
in this particular; introduced into the kingdom the
art of making gun-powder and brass cannon; fortified
her frontiers on the side of Scotland; made frequent re∣views
of the militia; encouraged agriculture by allow∣ing
a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and na∣vigation;
and so much encreased the shipping of her
kingdom, both by building vessels of Force herself, and
suggesting like undertakings to the merchants, that she
was justly stiled the restorer of naval glory, and the
Queen of the northern seas<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388. Strype. vol. I. p. 230, 336, 337.</NOTE>. The natural srugality
of her temper, so far from disqualifying her for these
great enterprizes, only enabled her to execute them
with greater certainty and success; and all the world
saw in her conduct the happy effects of a vigorous perse∣verance
in judicious and well conducted projects.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine, that so great a princess, who
enjoyed such felicity and renown, would receive propo∣sals
of marriage from every one, who had any likelihood
of succeeding; and tho' she had made some public de∣clarations
in favour of a single life, few believed, that
she would persevere for ever in that resolution. The
archduke Charles, second son to the emperor<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoynes. vol. I. p. 233.</NOTE>, as well
as Casimir, son to the elector palatine, made applicati∣ons
to her; and as this latter prince made profession
of the reformed religion, he thought himself, on this
account, better intitled to succeed in his addresses. Eric,
King of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Holstein, were
encouraged by the same views to become suitors; and
the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of Scotland, was,
by the states of that kingdom, recommended to her
as a suitable marriage. Even some of her own subjects,
tho' they did not openly declare their pretensions, en∣tertained
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
hopes of success.. The earl of Arundel, a per∣son
declining in years, but descended from a very anti∣ent
and noble family, as well as possessed of great ri∣ches,
flattered himself with this prospect; as did also Sir
William Pickering, a man much esteemed for his per∣sonal
merit. But the person most likely to succeed,
was a younger son of the late duke of Northumberland,
the lord Robert Dudley, who, by means of his exterior
qualities, joined to address and flattery, had become, in
a manner, her declared favourite, and had great influ∣ence
in all her councils. The less worthy he appeared
of this distinction, the more was his great favour ascri∣bed
to some violent affection, which could thus seduce
the judgment of this penetrating princess; and men long
expected, that he would obtain the preference above so
many princes and monarchs. But the Queen gave all
these suitors a gentle refusal, which still encouraged
their pursuit; and she thought, that she should the
better attach them to her interests, if they were still
allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pre∣tensions.
It is also probable, that this policy was not
entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry; and
that, tho' she was determined in her own mind never
to share her power with any man, she was not displea∣sed
with the courtship, sollicitation, and professions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
love, which the desire of acquiring so valuable a prize,
procured her from all quarters.</P>
<P>WHAT is most singular in the conduct and character
of Elizabeth, is, that, tho' she determined never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
have any heir of her own body, she was not only ex∣tremely
averse to fix any successor to the crown; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seems also to have resolved, as far as lay in her power
that no one, who had pretensions to the succession
should ever have any heirs of successors. After the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
clusion given by the will of Henry VIII. to the posteri
of Margaret, Queen of Scotland, the right to the cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
devolved on the house of Suffolk; and the lady Ca∣therine
Gray, younger sister to the lady Jane, was now
the heir of that family. This lady had been married
to the lord Herbert, fon to the earl of Pembroke; but
having been divorced from that nobleman, she had
made a private marriage with the earl of Hertford, son
to the protector; and her husband, soon after consum∣mation,
travelled into France. In a little time she ap∣peared
to be pregnant, which so enraged Elizabeth,
that she threw her into the Tower, and summoned him
to appear, in order to answer for his misdemeanor. He
made no scruple to acknowlege the marriage, which,
tho' concluded without the Queen's consent, was intire∣ly
suitable to both parties; and for this offence he was
also committed to the Tower. Elizabeth's severity
stopped not here: She issued a commission to enquire
into the matter; and as Hertford could not, within the
time limited, prove the nuptials by witnesses, their
commerce was declared unlawful, and their posterity
illegitimate. They were still continued in custody;
but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have
farther intercourse; and another child appeared to be
the fruit of their commerce. This was a fresh source
of vexation to the Queen who made a fine of fifteen
thousand pounds be set on Hertford by the Star-Cham∣ber,
and ordered his con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nement to be thenceforth still
more rigid and severe. He lay in this condition for nine
years, till the death of his wife, by freeing Elizabeth
from all fears, procured him his liberty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>. This extreme
severity must be accounted for, either by the unrelent∣ing
jealousy of the Queen, who was afraid that any
pretender to the succession would acquire credit by
having issue; or by her malignity, which, with all her
great qualities, made one ingredient in her character,

<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
and which led her to envy in others those natural plea∣sures
of love and posterity, of which her own ambiti∣on
and desire of dominion made her renounce all pros∣pect
for herself.</P>
<P>THERE happened, about this time, some other events
in the royal family, where the Queen's conduct was
more laudable. Arthur Pole, and his brother, ne∣phews
to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke
of Clarence, brother to Edward the fourth, together
with Anthony Fortescue, who had married a sister of
these gentlemen, and some other persons, were brought
to their trial for conspiring to withdraw into France,
with a view of receiving succours from the duke of
Guise, of returning thence into Wales, and of pro∣claiming
Mary Queen of England, and Arthur Pole
duke of Clarence. They confessed the indictment,
but asserted, that they never intended to execute these
projects during the Queen's life-time: They had only
deemed such procautions requisite in case of her death,
which, some pretenders to judicial astrology had assured
them, they might with certainty look for before the
year expired. They were condemned by the jury; but
received their pardon from the Queen's clemency<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 333. Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AFTER the commencement of the religious wars
in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1562. State of Europe.</NOTE> which rendered that flourishing king∣dom,
during the course of near forty years, a scene of
horror and devastation, the great rival powers in Europe
were Spain and England; and it was not long before
an animosity, first political, then personal, broke out
between the sovereigns of these countries.</P>
<P>PHILIP the second of Spain, tho' he reached not any
enlarged views of policy, was endowed with great indu∣stry
and sagacity, a remarkable caution in his enter∣prizes,
an unusual foresight in all his measures; and as
he was ever cool and seemingly unmoved by passion,
and possessed neither talents nor inclination for war,
both his subjects and his neighbours had reason to ex∣pect
great justice, happiness and tranquillity, from his
administration. But prejudices had on him a more
pernicious effect than ever passions had on any other
monarch; and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny, by
which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims
which governed his councils, excited the most violent
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
agitation among his own people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XL.</NOTE> engaged him in acts
of the most enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe
into combustion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1562.</NOTE></P>
<P>AFTER Philip had concluded peace at Cambray, and
had remained some time in the Netherlands, in order
to settle the affairs of that country, he embarked for
Spain; and as the gravity of that nation, with their
respectful obedience to their prince, had appeared much
more agreeable to his humour, than the homely fa∣miliar
manners, and the pertinacious liberty of the Fle∣mings,
it was expected, that he would for the future
reside altogether at Madrid, and would govern all his
extensive dominions by Spanish ministers and Spanish
councils. Having met with a violent tempest on his
voyage, he no sooner arrived in harbour, than he fell
on his knees, and after giving thanks for this delive∣rance,
he vowed, that his life, which was thus pro∣videntially
saved, should be thenceforth entirely devoted
to the extirpation of heresy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xxiii. cap. 14.</NOTE>. His subsequent conduct
corresponded to these professions. Finding that the new
doctrines had penetrated into Spain, he let loose the rage
of persecution against all who professed them, or were
suspected of adhering to them; and by his violence he
gave new edge, even to the unrelenting cruelty of
priests and inquisitors. He committed to custody Con∣stantine
Ponce, who had been confessor to his father,
the emperor Charles; who had attended him during
his retreat; and in whose arms that great monarch had
terminated his life: And after this ecclesiastic died in
prison, he still ordered him to be tried and condemned
for heresy, and his statue to be committed to the flames.
He even deliberated, whether he should not exercise
like severity against the memory of his father, who
was suspected, during his latter years, to have indulged
a propensity towards the Lutheran principles: In his
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
furious zeal for orthodoxy, he spared neither age, sex,
nor condition: He was present, with an inflexible
countenance, at the most barbarous executions: He
issued rigorous orders for the prosecution of heretics, in
Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: And
having founded his determined tyranny on maxims of
civil policy, as well as on principles of religion, all his
subjects saw, that there was no method, except the
most entire compliance, or most obstinate resistance,
to escape or elude the severity of his vengeance.</P>
<P>DURING that extreme animosity which prevailed be∣tween
the adherents of the opposite religions, the civil
magistrate, who found it difficult, if not impossible,
for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries,
was naturally led by specious rules of prudence, in
embracing one party, to dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are war against the other,
and to exterminate, by fire and sword, those bigots,
who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to
an opposition of his power, and to a hatred of his per∣son.
If any prince possessed such enlarged views as to
foresee, that a mutual toleration would in time abate
the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met with diffi∣culties
in reducing this principle to practice; and might
deem the malady too violent to await a remedy, which,
tho' certain, must necessarily be slow in its operations.
But Philip, tho' a profound hypocrite, and extremely
governed by self-interest, seems also to have been him∣self
actuated by an imperious bigotry; and as he em∣ployed
great reflection in all his conduct, he could
easily palliate the gratification of his natural temper
under the colour of wisdom, and find in this system
no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic po∣litics.
By placing himself at the head of the catho∣lic
party, he converted the zealots of the ancient faith
into partizans of the Spanish greatness; and by employ∣ing
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>
the powerful allurement of religion, he seduced
every where the subjects from that allegiance which
they owed their native sovereign.</P>
<P>THE course of events, guiding and concurring with
choice, had placed Elizabeth in a situation diametri∣cally
opposite; and had raised her to be the glory, the
bulwark, and the support of the numerous, tho' still
persecuted protestants, throughout all Europe. More
moderate in her temper than Philip, she found, with
pleasure, that the principles of her sect required not such
extreme severity in her domestic government, as was
exercised by that monarch; and having no object but
self-preservation, she united her interests in all foreign
negociations with those who were every where strug∣gling
under oppression, and guarding themselves against
ruin and extermination. The more virtuous sovereign
was thus happily thrown into the more favourable
cause; and fortune, in this instance, concurred with
policy and nature.</P>
<P>DURING the life-time of Henry the second and his
successor, the force of these principles was somewhat
restrained, tho' not altogether overcome, by the mo∣tives
of a superior interest; and the dread of uniting
England with the French mona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chy, engaged Philip
to maintain a good correspondence with Elizabeth.
Yet even during this period he rejected the garter which
she sent him; he refused to ratify the ancient league
between the house of Burgundy and England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Digges' Compleat ambassador, p. 369. Haynes, p. 585. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rype, vol. IV. No 246.</NOTE>; he
furnished ships to transport the French forces into Scot∣land;
he endeavoured to intercept the earl of Arran,
who was hastening to join the malecontents in that
country; and the Queen's wisest ministers still regarded
his friendship as hollow and precarious<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 280, 281, 283, 284.</NOTE>. But no
sooner did the death of Francis the second put an end
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>
to Philip's apprehensions with regard to Mary's
succession, than his animosity against Elizabeth began
more openly to appear, and the interests of Spain and
England were found opposite in every negociation and
transaction.</P>
<P>THE two great monarchies of the continent, France
and Spain, being possessed of nearly equal force, were
naturally antagonists; and England, from its power
and situation, was intitled to support its own dignity,
as well as tranquillity, by holding the ballance between
them. Whatever incident, therefore, tended too
much to depress any one of these rival powers, as it left
the other without controul, might be deemed contrary
to the interests of England: Yet so much were these
great maxims of policy over-ruled, during that age, by
the disputes of theology, that Philip found an advan∣tage
in supporting the established government and
religion of France; and Elizabeth in protecting faction
and innovation.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE>, when re-instated in
authority by the death of her son, Francis, had formed
a plan of administration more subtle than judicious; and
ballancing the Catholics with the hugonots, the duke
of Guise with the prince of Coridé, she endeavoured to
render herself necessary to both, and to establish her
own dominion on their constrained obedience<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. But
the equal counterpoise of power, which, among foreign
nations, is the source of tranquillity, proves always the
ground of quarrel between domestic factions; and if
the animosity of religion concur with the frequent
occasions which present themselves of mutual injury,
it is impossible, during any time, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o preserve a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>firm
concord in so delicate a situation. The constable,
Montmorency, moved by zeal for the ancient faith,
joined himself to the duke of Guise: The King of
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
Navarre, from his inconstant temper, and his jealousy
of the superior genius of his brother, embraced the same
party: And Catherine, finding herself depressed by this
combination, had recourse to Condé and the hugonots,
who gladly embraced the opportunity of fortifying
themselves by her countenance and protection<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">I bid. lib. iii.</NOTE>. An
edict had been published, granting a toleration to the
protestants; but the interested violence of the duke of
Guise, covered with the pretence of religious zeal,
broke thro' this agreement; and the two parties, after
the fallacious tranquillity of a moment, renewed their
mutual insults and injuries. Condé, Coligni, An∣delot,
assembled their friends, and flew to arms: Guise
and Montmorency got possession of the King's person,
and constrained the Queen-regent to embrace their
party: Fourteen armies were levied and put in motion
in different places of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii.</NOTE>: Each province, each
city, each family, was agitated with intestine rage
and animosity. The father was divided against the
son; the brother against the brother; and women
themselves, sacrificing their humanity as well as their
timidity to the religious fury, distinguished themselves
by acts of ferocity and valour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">I bid.</NOTE>. Wherever the hu∣gonots
prevailed, the images were broke, the altars
pillaged, the churches demolished, the monasteries con∣sumed
with fire: Where success attended the catholics,
they burned the bibles, re-baptized the insants, con∣strained
married persons to pass anew thro' the ceremo∣ny:
And plunder, desolation, and bloodshed attended
equally the triumph of both parties. The Parliament
of Paris itself, the seat of law and justice, instead of
employing its authority to compose these fatal quarrels,
published an edict, by which it put the sword into
the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered
the catholics every where to massacre the hugo∣nots<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p. 391.</NOTE>:
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
And it was during this period, when men be∣gan
to be somewhat enlightened, and in this nation,
renowned for polished manners, that the theological
rage, which had long been boiling in mens veins,
seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and
ferocity.</P>
<P>PHILIP, who was jealous of the progress which the
hugonots made in France, and who dreaded that the con∣tagion
would spread into the Low Country Provinces,
had formed a secret alliance with the princes of Guise,
and had entered into a mutual concert for the protec∣tion
of the ancient faith, and the suppression of heresy.
He now sent six thousand men, with some supply of
money, to reinforce the catholic party; and the prince
of Condé, finding himself unequal to so great a com∣bination,
countenanced by the regal authority, was
obliged to dispatch the Vidame of Chartres and Bri∣guemaut
to London, in order to crave the assistance
and protection of Elizabeth. Most of the province of
Normandy was possessed by the hugorots;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre de Grace put in possession of the English.</NOTE> and Condé
offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the
English; on condition, that, together with three thou∣sand
men for the garrison of that place, the Queen
should likewise send over three thousand to defend Di∣eppe
and Rouen, and should furnish the prince with
a supply of a hundred thousand crowns<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, besides the general and essential inter∣est
of supporting the protestants, and opposing the ra∣pid
progress of her enemy, the duke of Guise, had other
motives which engaged her to accept this proposal.
When she concluded the peace at Cateau Cambresis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th September.</NOTE>
she had good reason to foresee, that France never
would voluntarily fulfil the article with regard to the
restitution of Calais; and many subsequent incidents
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
had tended to confirm this suspicion. Considerable
sums of money had been laid out on the fortifications;
long leases had been granted of the lands; and ma∣ny
inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle
there, by assurances that Calais should never be restored
to the English<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 54, 257.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore, very wisely
concluded, that could she get possession of Havre, a
place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and
was of much gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter importance than Calais, she should
easily constrain the French to execute the treaty, and
should have the glory of restoring to the crown that
anc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent possession, which was so much the favourite of
the nation.</P>
<P>NO measure could be more generally odious in
France, than the conclusion of this treaty with Eliza∣beth.
Men were naturally led to compare the con∣duct
of Guise, who had finally chased the English from
France, and had debarred these dangerous and destruc∣tive
enemies from all access into it, with the treasona∣ble
politics of Condé, who had again granted them an
entry into the heart of the kingdom. The prince had
the more reason to repent of this measure, as he reaped
not from it all the advantage which he expected. Three
thousand English immediately took possession of Hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Edward
Poinings; but the latter place was found so little capa∣ble
of being defended, that it was immediately abando∣ned<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The siege of Rouen was already formed by
the catholics, under the command of the King of Na∣varre
and the constable Montmorency; and it was with
difficulty that Poinings could throw a small reinforce∣ment
into the place. Tho' these English troops be∣haved
with great gallantry<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 161.</NOTE>, and the King of Navarre
was mortally wounded during the siege; the catholics
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
still continued the attack of the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">156.</NOTE> and carrying it
at last by assault, put the whole garrison to the sword.
The earl of Warwic, eldest son to the late duke of Nor∣thumberland,
arrived soon after at Havre, with ano∣ther
body of three thousand English, and took on him
the command of the place.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that the French catholics, flushed
with their success at Rouen, would immediately have
formed the siege of Havre, which was not as yet in
any condition of defence; but the intestine disorders of
the kingdom soon diverted their attention to another
enterprize. Andelot, seconded by the negociations of
Elizabeth, had levied a considerable body of protestants
in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the seat
of the hugonot's power, he enabled the prince of Con∣dé
and the admiral to take the field, and oppose the pro∣gress
of their enemies. After threatning Paris dur∣ing
some time, they took their march towards Nor∣mandy,
with a view of engaging the English to act in
conjunction with them, and of fortifying themselves
with the farther assistance which they expected from
the zeal and vigour of Elizabeth<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 230. Davila, lib. iii.</NOTE>. The catholics, com∣manded
by the constable, and under him by the duke
of Guise, followed on their rear; and overtaking them
at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. The field was
fought with great obstinacy on both sides: and the ac∣tion
was distinguished by this signal event, that Condé
and Montmorency, the commanders of the opposite
armies, remained both of them prisoners in the hands
of their enemies. The appearances of victory remain∣ed
with Guise; but the admiral, whose fate it ever was
to be defeated, and still to rise more terrible after his mis∣fortunes,
collected the remains of the army, and inspir∣ing
his own unconquerable courage and constancy in∣to
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
every breast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563.</NOTE> kept them in a body, and subdued some
of the most considerable places in Normandy. Eliza∣beth,
the better to support his cause, sent him a new
supply of an hundred thousand crowns; and offered,
if he could find merchants to lend him the money, to
give her bond for another hundred thousand<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 322, 347.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE expences incurred by assisting the French hu∣gonots
had emptied the Queen's exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563. 12 January. A Parliament.</NOTE> notwith∣standing
her extreme frugality; and in order to obtain
supply, she found herself under a necessity of summon∣ing
a Parliament: An expedient to which she never
voluntarily had recourse. A little before the meet∣ing
of this assembly, she had fallen into a dangerous
illness, the small pox; and as her life, during some
time, was despaired of, the people became the more
sensible of the perilous condition in which they stood,
on account of the uncertainty which, in case of her
decease, attended the succession of the crown. The
partizans of the Queen of Scots, and those of the house
of Suffolk, already divided the nation into factions;
and every one foresaw, that, tho' it might be possible
at present to determine the controversy by law, yet,
if the throne was vacant, nothing but the sword would
be able to fix a successor. The commons, therefore,
on the very opening of the session, voted an address to
the Queen; in which, after enumerating the dan∣gers
attending a broken and doubtful succession, and
mentioning the evils which their fathers had experien∣ced
from the contending titles of York and Lancas∣ter,
they entreated the Queen to put an end to their ap∣prehensions,
by choosing some husband, whom, they
promised, whoever he was, gratefully to receive, and
faithfully to serve, honour, and obey: Or if she had
entertained any reluctance to the married state, they
desired, that the lawful successor might be named, or
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
at least appointed by act of parliament. They re∣marked,
that during all the reigns which had passed
since the conquest, the nation had never before been
so unhappy, as not to know the person who, in case
of the sovereign's death, was legally entitled to the suc∣cession.
And they observed, that the certain and fix∣ed
order which took place in the inheritance of the
French monarchy, was one chief source of the usual
tranquillity, as well as of the happiness of that king∣dom<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon Dewes's Journ. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS subject, tho' extremely interesting to the na∣tion,
was very little agreeable to the Queen; and she
was sensible, that great difficulties would attend eve∣ry
decision. A declaration in favour of the Queen of
Scots, would form a settlement perfectly legal; be∣cause
that princess was commonly allowed to possess
the right of blood, and the exclusion given by Henry's
will, deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parlia∣ment,
would lose all authority whenever the Queen
and Parliament had made a new settlement, and re∣stored
the Scottish line to their place in the succession.
But she dreaded the giving encouragement to the ca∣tholics
her secret enemies, by this declaration. She
was sensible, that every heir was, in some degree, a ri∣val;
much more one who possessed a claim for the pre∣sent
possession of the crown, and who had already ad∣vanced,
in a very open manner, these dangerous pre∣tensions.
The great power of Mary, both from the
favour of the catholic princes, and her connections
with the house of Guise, not to mention the force and
situation of Scotland, was well known to her; and she
saw no security that that princess, if fortified by a sure
prospect of succession, would not again revive claims
which she could never yet be prevailed on formally
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
to relinquish. On the other hand, the title of the
house of Suffolk was supported only by the more zea∣lous
protestants; and it was very doubtful, whether
even a parliamentary declaration in its favour would
bestow on it such validity as to give satisfaction to the
people. The republican part of the constitution had
not as yet acquired such an ascendant as to controul,
in any degree, the ideas of hereditary right; and as the
legality of Henry's will was still disputed, tho' founded
on the utmost authority which a Parliament could bestow;
who could be assured, that a more recent act would be
acknowleged to have any greater force or validity? In
the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place,
the right of blood had still prevailed over religious preju∣dices;
and the nation had ever shewed itself disposed
rather to change its faith than the order of succession.
Even many Protestants declared themselves in favour
of Mary's claim of inheritance<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 322.</NOTE>; and nothing would
endanger more general disgust, than to see the Queen
openly, and without reserve, take party against it.
That princess also, finding herself injured in so sensible
a point, would thenceforth act as a declared enemy;
and uniting together her foreign and domestic friends,
the partizans of her present title and of her eventual
succession, would soon bring matters to extremity
against the public establishment. The Queen, weigh∣ing
all these inconveniences, which were great and ur∣gent,
was determined to keep both parties in awe,
by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct; and she
chose rather that the people should run the hazard of
contingent events, than that herself should visibly en∣danger
her throne, by employing expedients, which,
at best, did not give entire security to the nation. She
made, therefore, an evasive answer to the applications
of the commons; and when the house, at the end of the
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
sessions, desired, by the mouth of their speaker, far∣ther
satisfaction on that head, she could not be prevail∣ed
on to make her reply more explicite. She only told
them, contrary to her declarations in the beginning of
her reign, that she had fixed no absolute resolution
against marriage; and she added, that the difficulties
with which the question of the succession was attended,
were so great, that she would be contented, for their
sake, to remain some time longer in this vale of misery;
and never should depart this life with satisfaction, till
she had laid some solid foundation for their future
security<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon D' Ewes's Journal, p. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable law passed this session was that
which bore the title of <HI>Assurance of the Queen's royal pow∣er
over all states and subjects within her dominions</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">5 Eliz. c. r.</NOTE>. By
this act, the asserting twice by writing, word, or deed,
the pope's authority, was subjected to the penalties of
treason. All persons in holy orders were bound to
take the oath of supremacy; as also, all who were ad∣vanced
to any degrees, either in the universities or in
common law; all schoolmasters, officers in court, or
members of Parliament: And the penalty of their se∣cond
refusal was treason. The first offence in both
cases, was punished by banishment and forfeiture.
This rigorous statute, which involved a real, tho' not
general, persecution, and of the worst kind too, as it
made a scrutiny into mens secret sentiments, was not
extended to any of the degree of a baron; because it
was not supposed, that the Queen could entertain any
doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons possessed
of such high dignity. The lord Montacute made vi∣gorous
opposition to this bill; and asserted, in favour
of the catholies, that they disputed not, they preached
not, they disobeyed not the Queen, they caused no
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
trouble no tumults among the people<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 260.</NOTE>. It is, how∣ever,
probable, that some suspicions of their secret con∣spiracies
had made the Queen and Parliament increase
their rigour against them; tho' it is also more than
probable, that they were mistaken in the nature of the
remedy.</P>
<P>THERE was likewise another point in which the
Parliament, this session, shewed more the goodness of
their intention than the soundness of their judgment.
They passed a law against fond and fantastical prophe∣cies,
which had been observed to seduce the people in∣to
rebellion and disorder<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">5 Eliz. c. 15.</NOTE>: But at the same time they
enacted a statute which was most likely to increase
these and such like superstitions: It was levelled against
conjurations, enchantments, and witchcrafts<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 16.</NOTE>. Witch∣craft
and heresy are two crimes which commonly in∣crease
by punishment, and never are so effectually sup∣pressed
as by being totally neglected. After the Par∣liament
had granted the Queen a supply of one subsi∣dy
and two fifteenths, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was finished by a prorogation.
The convocation likewise voted the Queen a subsidy
of six shillings in the pound, payable in three
years.</P>
<P>WHILE the English parties exerted these calm ef∣forts
against each other, in parliamentary votes and de∣bates,
the French factions, enflamed to the highest de∣gree
of animosity, continued that cruel war which
their intemperate zeal, actuated by the ambition of
their leaders, had kindled in the kingdom. The ad∣miral
was successful in reducing the towns of Norman∣dy
which held for the King; but he frequently com∣plained,
that the numerous garrison of Havre remained
totally unactive, and was not employed in any milita∣ry
operations against the common enemy. The Queen,
in taking possession of that place, had published a ma∣nifesto<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II.</NOTE>,
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
in which she pretended, that her concern for
the French King's interest had engaged her in that
measure, and that her sole intention was to oppose
her enemies of the house of Guise, who held their
prince in captivity, and employed his power to the de∣struction
of his best and most faithful subjects. It
was chiefly her desire to preserve appearances, joined
to the great frugality of her temper, which made her,
at this critical juncture, keep her soldiers in garrison,
and restrain them from committing farther hostilities
upon the enemy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 276, 277.</NOTE>. The duke of Guise, meanwhile,
was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the hugo∣nots;
and had commenced the siege of Orleans, which
was commanded by Andelot, and where the consta∣ble
was detained prisoner. He had the prospect of
speedy success in this undertaking; when he was assassi∣nated
by Poltrot, a young gentleman, whose zeal,
instigated (as it is pretended, tho' without any certain
foundation) by the admiral and Beza, a famous preach∣er,
led him to attempt that criminal enterprise. The
death of this gallant prince was a very sensible loss to
the catholic party; and tho' the cardinal of Lorraine,
his brother, still supported the interests of the family,
the danger of their progress appeared much less immi∣nent,
both to Queen Elizabeth and to the French
protestants. The union, therefore, between these al∣lies,
which had been cementedby their common fears, be∣gan
thenceforth to be less intimate; and the leaders of the
hugonots were persuaded to hearken to terms of accom∣modation.
Condé and Montmorency held conferences
for settling the peace; and as they were both of them im∣patient
to relieve themselves from captivity, they soon
came to an agreement with regard to the conditions.
The character of the Queen-regent, whose ends were
always violent, but who endeavoured, by subtilty and
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
policy, rather than force, to attain them, led her to
embrace any plausible terms; and in spite of the admi∣ral's
protestations, whose sagacity could easily disco∣ver
the treachery of the court, the articles of agreement
were finally settled between the parties. A toleration,
under some restrictions, was anew granted to the pro∣testants;
a general amnesty was published; Condé
was reinstated in his offices and governments; and
after money was advanced for the payment of arrears
due to the German troops, they were dismissed the
kingdom.</P>
<P>BY the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince
of Condé, it had been stipulated<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 79.</NOTE>, that neither party
should conclude peace without the consent of the
other; but this article was at present but little regarded
by the leaders of the French protestants. They on∣ly
comprehended her so far in the treaty, as to obtain
a promise, that, on her relinquishing Havre, her char∣ges
and the money which she had advanced them,
should be repaid her by the King of France, and that
Calais, on the expiration of the term, should be resto∣red
to her. But she disdained to accept of these terms;
and thinking the possession of Havre a much better
pledge for the obtaining her purpose, she sent War∣wic
orders to prepare himself against an attack from
the now united power of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic, who commanded a garrison
of six thousand men, beside seven hundred pioniers, had
no sooner got possession of Havre, than he employed
every means for putting it in a posture of defence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 153.</NOTE>; and
after expelling the French from the town, he encoura∣ged
his soldiers to make the most desperate defence
against the enemy. The constable commanded the
French army; the Queen-regent herself, and the
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
King, were present in the camp; even the prince of
Condé joined the King's forces, and gave counte∣nance
to this enterprise; the admiral and Andelot alone,
who still desired to preserve Elizabeth's friendship,
kept at a distance, and prudently refused to join their
antient enemies in an attack upon their allies.</P>
<P>BY the force, and dispositions, and situation of both
sides, it was expected, that the siege would be attend∣ed
with some very memorable event; yet did France
make a much easier acquisition of this important place,
than was at first apprehended. The plague crept in
among the English soldiers; and being encreased by
their fatigue and bad diet (for they were but ill sup∣plied
with provisions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 377, 45.</NOTE>) it committed sue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> revages,
that sometimes a hundred men a day di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of it, and
there remained not at last fifteen hundred in a condi∣tion
to do duty<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 450, 458.</NOTE>. The French, meeting with such
feeble resistance, carried on their attacks successfully;
and having made two breaches, each of them sixty feet
wide, they prepared for a general assault, which must
have terminated in the slaughter of the whole garri∣son<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. II. p. 49</NOTE>. Warwic, who had frequently warned the English
council of the danger, and who had loudly demanded
a supply of men and provisions, found himself obliged
to capitulate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre lost. 28th July.</NOTE> and to content himself with the liberty
of withdrawing his garrison. The articles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were no
sooner signed, than lord Clinton, the admiral, who
had been detained by contrary winds, appeared off
the harbour with a reinforcement of three thousand
men; and found the place surrendered to the enemy.
To encrease the misfortune, the infected army brought
the plague with them into England, where it swept
off great multitudes, particularly in the city of Lon∣don.
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
Above twenty thousand persons there died of
it in one year<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This year the council of Trent was dissolved, which had sat from 1545. The publication of its decrees excited anew the general ferment in Europe; while the catholics endeavoured to enforce the acceptance of them, and the protestants rejected them. The religious controversies were too far advanced to expect any conviction would result from the decrees of this council. It is the only general council which has been held in an age truly learned and inquisitive; and as the history of it has been wrote with great penetration and judgment, it has tended very much to expose clerical usurpations and intriguës, and may serve us as a specimen of more an∣tient councils. No one expects to see another general council, till the decay of learning and the progress of ignorance shall again fit mankind for these great impostures.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1564.</NOTE></P>
<P>ELIZABETH, whose usual vigour and foresight had
not appeared in these transactions, was now glad to
compound matters; and as the Queen-regent desir'd
to obtain leizure, in order to prepare measures for the
extermination of the hugonots, she readily hearkened
to any reasonable terms of accommodation with
England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 3.</NOTE>. It was agreed, that the hostages, which
the French had given for the restitution of Calais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 April.</NOTE>
should be restored for 220,000 crowns; and that both
sides should retain all their claims and pretensions.</P>
<P>THE peace still continued with Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots af∣fairs.</NOTE> and even
a cordial friendship seemed to have been cemented be∣tween
Elizabeth and Mary. These princesses made
profession of the most entire affection; wrote amica∣ble
letters every week to each other; and had adopted,
in all appearance, the sentiments as well as style, of
sisters. Elizabeth punished one Hales, who had com∣posed
a book against Mary's title<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 252.</NOTE>; and as the lord
keeper, Bacon, was thought to have encouraged Hales
in this undertaking, he fell under her displeasure, and
it was with some difficulty that he was able to give
her satisfaction, and recover her good opinion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 253.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
two Queens had agreed in the foregoing summer to
an interview at York<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 388.</NOTE>; in order to remove all diffi∣culties
with regard to Mary's ratification of the treaty
of Edinburg, and to consider of the proper method
for settling the succession of England: But as Eliza∣beth
carefully avoided touching on this delicate subject,
she employed a pretence of the wars in France,
which, she said, would detain her in London; and she
delayed till next year the intended interview. It is
also probable, that, being well acquainted with the
beauty and address and accomplishments of Mary, she
did not chose to stand the comparison with regard to
those exterior qualities, in which she was eclipsed by
her rival; and was unwilling, that a princess, who had
already made great progress in the esteem and affecti∣ons
of the English, should have a farther opportunity
of encreasing the number of her partizans.</P>
<P>MARY's close connexions with the house of Guise,
and her devoted attachment to her uncles, by whom
she had been educated and protected, was the ground
of just and unsurmountable jealousy to Elizabeth, who
regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies,
and was well acquainted with their dangerous charact∣er
and ambitious projects. They had made offer of
their niece to Don Carlos, Philip's son; to the King
of Sweeden, the King of Navarre, the archduke
Charles, the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of Bourbon,
who had only taken deacons orders, from which he
might easily be absolved; and they were ready to marry
her to any one, who could strengthen their interests,
or give inquietude and disturbance to Elizabeth<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 287. Strype, vol. I. p. 400.</NOTE>.
Elizabeth on her part was equally vigilant to prevent
the execution of their schemes, and was partcularly
anxious, lest Mary should form any powerful foreign
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
alliance, which might tempt her to revive her preten∣sions
to the crown, and to invade the kingdom on the
side where it was weakest and lay most exposed<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 247, 284.</NOTE>. As
she believed, that the marriage with the archduke
Charles was the one most likely to have place, she
used every expedient to prevent it; and besides remon∣strating
against it to Mary herself, she endeavoured to
draw off the archduke from that pursuit, by giving him
some reason to hope for success in his pretensions to
herself, and by inviting him to a renewal of the former
treaty of marriage<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 41.</NOTE>. She always told the Queen of
Scots, that nothing would satisfy her but her espousing
some English nobleman, who would remove all
grounds of jealousy, and cement the union between
the two kingdoms; and she offered on this condition
to have her title examined, and to declare her the suc∣cessor
to the crown<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 243, 249, 259, 265.</NOTE>. After keeping the matter in these
general terms during a twelvemonth, she at last named
the lord Robert Dudley, now created earl of Leicester,
as the person on whom she desired that Mary's choice
should fall.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leicester, the great and powerful
favourite of Elizabeth, possessed all those exterior qua∣lities,
which are naturally alluring to the fair sex; a
handsome person, a polite address, an insinuating
behaviour; and by means of these acomplishments, he
had been able to blind even the penetration of Eli∣zabeth,
and conceal from her the great defects, or
rather odious vices, which attended his character.
He was proud, insolent, interested, ambitious; without
honour, without generosity, without humanity; and
attoned not for these bad qualities, by any such abilities
or courage, as could fit him for that high trust and
confidence with which she always honoured him.
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
Her constant and declaed attachment to him had very
naturally emboldened him to aspire to her bed; and in
order to make way for these nuptials, he was univer∣sally
believed to have murdered, in a barbarous manner,
his wife, the heiress of one Robesart. The proposal
of espousing Mary was by no means agreeable to him;
and he always ascribed it to the contrivance of Cecil,
his enemy; who intented by that artifice to make him
lose the friendship of Mary from the temerity of his
pretensions, and that of Elizabeth from jealousy of
his attachments to another woman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 396.</NOTE>. The Queen
herself had not any serous intention of effecting this
marriage; but, as she was desirous, that the Queen
of Scots should never take any husband, she named
a man, who she believed, was not likely to be ac∣cepted
of; and she hoped, by that means, to gain
time, and elude the project of any other alliance.
The earl of Leicester was too great a favourite to be
parted with; and when Mary, allured by the prospect
of being declared successor to the crown, seemed at
last to hearken to Elizabeth's proposal, this princess
receded from her former offers, and withdrew the bait,
which she had formerly thrown out to her rival<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 269, 270. Appendix, p. 158. Strype, vol. I. p. 414.</NOTE>.
This duplicity of conduct, joined to some appearance
of an imperious superiority, assumed by her, had drawn
a peevish letter from Mary; and the seemingly ami∣cable
correspondence of the two Queens was, during
some time, interrupted. In order to make up this
breach, the Queen of Scots dispatched Sir James
Melvil to London; who has given us a very particu∣lar
accont of his negociation.</P>
<P>MELVIL was an agreeable courtier, a man of ad∣dress
and conversation; and it was recommended to
him by his mistress, that, besides grave reasonings
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
concerning politics and state-affairs, he should in∣troduce
more entertaining topics of conversation,
suitable to the sprightly character of Elizabeth; and
should endeavour by that means to insinuate himslef
into her confidence. He succeeded so well, that he
threw that artful princess entirely off her guard<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hayzes, p. 447.</NOTE>, and
brought her to discover the bottom of her heart,
full of all those levities and follies and ideas of rival∣ship,
which possess the youngest and most frivolous
of her sex. He talked to her of his travels, and forgot
not to mention the different dresses of the ladies in
different countries, and the particular advantages of
each, in setting off the beauties of the shape and per∣son.
The Queen said that she had dresses of all
countries, and she took care thenceforth to meet the
ambassador every day apparelled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in a different habit:
Sometimes she was dressed in the English garb, some∣times
in the French, sometimes in the Italian; and
she asked him, which of them became her most. He
answered, the Italian; a reply, that he knew would
be agreeable to her, because that mode showed her
flowing locks, which, he remarked, tho' they were
more red than yellow, she fancied to be the finest in
the world. She desired to know of him what was
reputed the best colour of hair: She asked whether his
Queen's hair or hers was best: She even enquired
which of them he esteemed the fairest person: A very
delicate question, and which he prudently eluded, by
saying that her majesty was the fairest person in Eng∣land,
and his mistress in Scotland. She next demand∣ed
which of them was tallest: He replied, his queen:
Then, said Elizabeth, she is too tall: For I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> myself
am of a just stature. Having learned from him, that
his mistress sometimes recreated herself by playing on
the harpsicord, an instrument on which she herself
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
excelled, she gave orders to lord Hunsdon, that he
should lead him as it were casually, into an apartment,
where he might hear her perform; and when Melvil,
as if ravished with the harmony, broke into the
Queen's apartment, she pretended to be displeased
at his intrusion; but still took care to ask him whether
he thought Mary or her the best performer on that
instrument<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Melvil. p, 49, 50.</NOTE>. From the whole of her behaviour,
Melvil thought he might, on his return, assure his
mistress that she had no reason ever to expect any
cordial friendship from Elizabeth, and that all her pro∣fessions
of amity were full of falshood and dissimula∣tion.</P>
<P>AFTER
two years had been spent in evasions and
artfices<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 264.</NOTE>, Mary's subjects and counsellors, and pro∣bably
herself, began to think it full time that some
alliance were concluded; and the lord Darnley, son
to the earl of Lenox, was the person, in whom most
mens opinons and wishes centered. He was Mary's
cousin-german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece
to Harry the eighth, and daughter to the earl of An∣gus,
by Margaret, Queen of Scotland. He had been
born and educated in England, where the earl of
Lenox had constantly resided, ever since he had been
banished by the prevailing power of the house of Ha∣milton;
and as Darnley was now in his twentieth
year, and was a ver comely person, tall and delicately
shaped, it was hoped, that he might soon render him∣self
agreeable to the Queen of Scots. He was also by
his father a branch of the same family with herself;
and would, in espousing her, preserve the royal dig∣nity
in the house of Stuart: He was, after her, next
heir to the crown of England; and those who pre∣tended
to exclude her on account of her being a fo∣reigner,
had endeavoured to recommend his title, and
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
give it the preference. It seemed no inconsiderable
advantage, that she could, by marrying him, unite
both their claims; and as he was by birth an English∣man,
and could not by his power or alliances give any
ground of suspicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that
the proposal of this marriage would not be unaccept∣able
to that jealous princess.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was well informed of these intentions
of the court of Edinburgh<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 261.</NOTE>; and was secretly not dis∣pleased
with the projected marriage between Darnley
and the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 280, 282. Jebb, vol. II. p. 46.</NOTE>. She would rather have
wished, that Mary had continued for ever in a single
life; but finding little probability of rendering this
scheme effectual, she was satisfied with a choice,
which freed her at once from the dread of a foreign
alliance, and from the necessity of parting with Lei∣cester,
her favourite. In order to pave the way to
Darnley's marriage, she secretly desired Mary to in∣vite
Lenox into Scotland, to reverse his attainder,
and to restore him to his honours and fortune<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 255, 259, 272.</NOTE>. And
when her request was complied with, she took care,
in order to preserve the friendship of the Hamiltons
and her other partizans in Scotland, to blame openly
this conduct of Mary<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 42.</NOTE>. Hearing that the negotiation
for Darnley's marriage proceeded apace, she gave that
nobleman permission, on his first application, to follow
his father into Scotland: But no sooner did she learn,
that the Queen of Scots was taken with his figure and
person, and that all measures were fixed for espousing
him, than she exclaimed against the marriage; sent
Throcmorton to order Darnley immediately upon his
allegiance, to return into England; threw the coun∣tess
of Lenox and her second son into the Tower,
where they suffered a very rigorous confinement;
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
seized all Lenox's English estate; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1565.</NOTE> tho' in was im∣possible
for her to assign one single reason of her dis∣pleasure<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 274, 275.</NOTE>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>she menaced, and protested, and com∣plained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE> as if she had suffered the most grievous injury
in the world.</P>
<P>THE politics of Elizabeth, tho' judicious, were
usually full of duplicity and artifice; but never more
so than in her transactions with the Queen of Scots,
where there entered so many little passions and narrow
jealousies, that she durst not avow to the world the
reasons of her conduct, scarcely to her ministers, and
scarcely even to herself. But besides a womanish
rivalship and envy against the marriage of this prin∣cess,
she had some motives of interest for feigning a
displeasure on the present occasion. It served her as
a pretence for refusing to acknowledge Mary's title to
the succession of England; a point to which she was
determined never to consent. And it was useful to
her for a purpose, still more unfriendly and dangerous,
for encouraging the discontents and rebellion of the
Scottish nobility and ecclesiastics<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 290.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more unhappy for a people than
to be governed by a sovereign, who is attached to a
religion different from that which is established; and
it is scarce possible, that a mutual confidence can
ever, in such a situation, have place between the
prince and his subjects. Mary's conduct had been
hitherto, in every respect, unexceptionable, and even
laudable; yet had she not made such progress in ac∣quiring
popularity, as might have been expected from
her gracious deportment and agreeable accomplish∣ments.
Suspicions every moment prevailed on ac∣count
of her attachment to the catholic faith, and
especially to her uncles, the open and avowed pro∣moters
of the scheme for exterminating the professors
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
of the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She
still refused to ratify the acts of Parliament, which had
established the reformation; she made attempts for re∣storing
to the catholic bishops some part of their civil
jurisdiction<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 198.</NOTE>; and she wrote a letter to the council
of Trent, in which, besides professing her attachment
to the catholic faith, she took notice of her title to
succeed to the crown of England, and expressed her
hopes of being able, in some period, to bring back
all her dominions to the bosom of the church<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii.</NOTE> The
zealots among the protestants were not wanting, in
their turn, to practise insults upon her, which tended
still more to alienate her from their faith. A law
was enacted, making it capital, even on the first
offence, to say mass any where, except in the Queen's
chappel<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 268.</NOTE>; and it was with great difficulty that even
this small indulgence was granted her: The general
assembly importuned her anew to change her religion,
to renounce the blasphemous idolatry of the mass, with
the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist, and to em∣brace
the true religion of Chrift Jesus<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 545. Knox, p. 374.</NOTE> As she an∣swered
with temper, that she was not yet convinced
of the falshood of her religion or the impiety of the
mass; and that her apostacy would lose her the friend∣ship
of her allies on the continent; they replied, by
assuring her, that their religion was undoubtedly the
same which had been revealed by Jesus Christ, which
had been preached by the apostles, and which had
been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages;
that neither the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papists
was built on so solid a foundation as theirs; that they
alone, of all the various species of religionists spread
over the face of the earth, were so happy as to be
possessed of the truth; that those who hear, or rather
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
who gaze on the mass, allow sacrilege, pronounce blas∣phemy,
and commit most abominable idolatry; and that
the friendship of the King of kings was preferable to
all the confederacies and alliances in the world<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Keith, 550, 551.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE marriage of the Queen of Scots had kindled
afresh the zeal of the reformers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of Scots marries the earl of Darn∣ley.</NOTE> because the family of
Lenox was believed to adhere to the catholic faith;
and tho' Darnley, who now bore the name of King
Henry, went often to the established church, he could
not, by this exterior compliance, gain the confidence
and regard of the ecclesiastics. They rather laid hold
of this opportunity to insult him to his face; and Knox
scrupled not to tell him from the pulpit, that God, for
punishment of the offences and ingratitude of the peo∣ple,
was wont to commit the rule over them to boys
and women<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 546. Knox, p. 381.</NOTE> The populace of Edinburgh, instiga∣ted
by such doctrine, began to meet and to associate
themselves against the government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 377.</NOTE> But what threat∣ned
with more immediate danger Mary's authority,
were the discontents which prevailed among some of
the principal nobility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the
restoration, and still more with the aggrandizement,
of the family of Lenox, his hereditary enemies; and
entertained fears left his eventual succession to the
crown of Scotland should be excluded by his rival, who
had formerly advanced some pretensions to it. The
earl of Murray found his credit at court much di∣minished
by the interest of Lenox, and his son; and
began to apprehend the revocation of some con∣siderable
grants which he had obtained from Mary's
liberality. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and Glen∣cairne,
the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of
<PB N="92" REF="103"/>
Grange, Pittarow, were instigated by like motives;
and as these were the persons who had most zealously
promoted the reformation, they were disgusted to find
that the Queen's favour was entirely engrossed by a
new cabal, the earls of Bothwel, Athole, Sutherland,
and Huntley; men who were esteemed either luke∣warm
in religious controversy, or inclined to the ca∣tholic
party. The same ground of discontent, which,
in other courts, is the scource of intrigue, faction,
and opposition, commonly produced in Scotland, either
projects of assassination, or of rebellion; and besides
mutual accusations of the former kind, which it is
difficult to clear up<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It appears, however, from Randolf's Letters, Keith, p. 290, that some offers had been made to that minister, of seizing Lenox and Darn∣ley, and delivering them into Queen Elizabeth's hands. Melvil confirms the same story, and says, that the design was ackno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ledged by the conspi∣rators. P. 56. This serves to justify the account given by the Queen's par∣ty of the Raid of Baith, as it is called. See farther Goodall, vol. II. p. 358. The other conspiracy, of which Murray complained, is much more uncertain, and is founded on very doubtful evidence.</NOTE>, the discontented lords, as soon
as they saw the Queen's marriage entirely resolved
on, entered into a confederacy for taking arms against
their sovereign. They met at Stirling; pretended an
anxious concern for the security of religion; framed
engagements for mutual defence; and made applica∣tions
to Elizabeth for assistance and protection<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 293, 294, 300, 301.</NOTE> That
princess, after publishing the expressions of her dis∣pleasure
against the marriage, had secretly ordered
her ambassadors Randolf and Throcmorton, to give
in her name some promises of support to the malecon∣tents;
and had even sent them a supply of ten thousand
pounds, to enable them to begin their insurrection<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 380. K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith, Ap∣pen. p. 164. Anderson, vol. III. p. 194.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY was no sooner informed of the meeting at
Stirling, and the movements of the lords, than she
<PB N="93" REF="104"/>
summoned them to appear at court, in order to answer
for their conduct; and having levied some forces to ex∣ecute
the laws, she obliged the malecontents to leave
the low country, and take shelter in Argyleshire.
That she might more effectually cut off all their re∣sources,
she proceeded with the king to Glasgow, and
forced them from their retreat. They appeared at
Paisly in the neighbourhood with about a thousand
horse; and passing the Queen's army, proceeded to
Hamilton, and thence to Edinburgh, which they en∣tered
without resistance. They expected great rein∣forcements
in this place, from the efforts of Knox and
the seditious preachers; and they beat their drums, de∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
all men to enlist, and receive wages for the de∣fence
of God's glory<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Knox. p. 381.</NOTE> But the nation was in no
disposition for rebellion: Mary was esteemed and belo∣ved:
Her marriage was not generally disagreeable to
the people: And the interested views of the malecon∣tent
lords were so well known, that their pretence
of zeal for religion had little influence even on the ig∣norant
populace<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 380, 385.</NOTE> The King and Queen advanced
to Edinburgh at the head of their army: The rebels
were obliged to retire into the south; and being pursu∣ed
by a force which now amounted to eighteen thou∣sand
men<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 388.</NOTE>, they found themselves under a necessity of
abandoning their country, and of taking shelter in England.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when she found the event so much
to disappoint her expectations, thought proper to dis∣own
all connections with the Scottish malecontents,
and to declare every where, that she had never given
them any encouragement, or any promise of counte∣nance
or assistance. She even carried farther her dissmu∣lation
and hypoorisy. Murray had come to London,
with the abbot of Kilwinning, agent for Chatelrault;
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>
and she seduced them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1565</NOTE> by secret assurances of protection,
to declare, before the ambassadors of France and Spain,
that she had no-wise contributed to their insurrection.
No sooner had she extorted this confession from them,
than she chased them from her presence, called them
unworthy traytors, declared that their detestable re∣bellion
was of bad example to all princes, and assured
them, that as she had hitherto given them no encou∣ragement,
so they should never thenceforth receive
from her any assistance or protection<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 57. Knox, p. 388. Keith, p. 319. Crawford, p. 62, 63.</NOTE> Throcmor∣ton
alone, whose honour was equal to his abilities,
could not be prevailed on to conceal the part which
he had acted in the enterprise of the Scots rebels; and
being well apprised of the usual character and conduct
of Elizabeth, he had had the precaution to obtain an
order of council to authorize the engagements which
he had been obliged to take with them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 60.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE banished lords, finding themselves so ill used
by Elizabeth, had recourse to the clemency of their
sovereign; and after some sollicitation, and some pro∣fessions
of sincere repentance, the duke of Chatelrault
obtained his pardon, on condition that he should retire
into France. Mary was more implacable against the
ungrateful earl of Murray, and the other confederates,
on whom she threw the chief blame of the enterprize;
but as she was continually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plied with applications
from their friends, and as some of her most judicious
partizans in England thought, that nothing would more
promote her interests in that kingdom, than the gentle
treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against
the catholic religion; she agreed to give way to her
natural temper, which inclined not to severity, and
she seemed determined to restore them to her favour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Keith, p. 322.</NOTE>.
In this interval, Rambouillet arrived as ambassador
<PB N="95" REF="106"/>
from France, and brought her advice from her uncle,
the cardinal of Lorraine, to whose opinion she always
paid an extreme deference, by no means to pardon
these protestant leaders, who had been engaged in a
rebellion against her<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 325. Melvil, p. 63.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE two religions, in France, as well as in other
parts of Europe, were rather irritated than satiated
with their mutual violences; and the peace granted
to the hugonots, as had been foreseen by the admiral,
was intended only to lull them asleep, and prepare
the way for their final and absolute destruction. The
Queen-regent made a pretence of travelling thro' the
kingdom, in order to visit the provinces, and correct
all the abuses arising from the late war; and after ha∣ving
held some conferences on the frontiers with the
duke of Lorraine, and the duke of Savoy, she came to
Bayonne, where she was met by her daughter, the
Queen of Spain, and the duke of Alva. Nothing
appeared in the congress of these two splendid courts,
but gaiety, festivity, love, and joy; but amidst these
smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes
the most bloody, and the most destructive to the re∣pose
of mankind, which had ever been thought of in
any age or nation. No less than a total and univer∣sal
extermination of the protestants by fire and sword,
was concerted by Philip and Catherine of Medicis;
and Alva, agreeable to his fierce and sanguinary dispo∣sition,
advised the Queen-regent to commence the exe∣cution
of this project, by the immediate massacre of all
the leaders of the hugonots<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. iii.</NOTE> But that princess, tho'
equally hardened against every humane sentiment,
would not forego this opportunity of displaying her
wit and resined politics; and she proposed, rather by
treachery and dissimulation, which she called address,
to lead the Protestants into the snare, and never to
<PB N="96" REF="107"/>
draw the sword till they were totally disabled from re∣sistance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confederacy against the protestants.</NOTE>
The cardinal of Lorraine, whose character
bore a greater affinity to that of Alva, was a chief
author of this barbarous association against the refor∣mers;
and having connected his hopes of success with
the aggrandizement of his niece, the Queen of Scots,
he took care that her measures should agree with those
violent councils, which were embraced by the other
catholic princes. In consequence of this scheme, he
turned her from the road of clemency, which she in∣tended
to have followed, and made her resolve on
the total ruin of the banished lords<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 63. Keith's Append. p. 176.</NOTE> A Parliament
was summoned to meet at Edinburgh for their forsei∣ture
and attainder;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1566</NOTE> and as the crime of which they
had been guilty, was palpable and avowed, no doubt
could be entertained but sentence would be pronoun∣ced
against them. It was by a sudden and violent
accident, which, in the issue, brought on the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in of
Mary, that they were saved from the rigour of the
law.</P>
<P>THE marriage of the Queen of Scots with lord
Darnley was so natural, and so inviting in all its circum∣stances,
that it had been precipitantly agreed to by
that princess and her council; and while she was allu∣red
by his youth, and beauty, and exterior accomplish∣ments,
she had at first overlooked the qualities of his
mind, which no wife corresponded with the excel∣lence
of his outward figure. Violent, yet variable in
his enterprizes; insolent, yet credulous and easily go∣verned
by flatterers; he was devoid of all gratitude, be∣cause
he thought no favours equal to his merit; and be∣ing
addicted to low pleasures, he was equally incapable
of all true sentiments of love and tenderness<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 287. 329. Appen. p. 163.</NOTE> The
Queen of Scots, in the first effusions of her fondeness,
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>
had taken a pleasure in exalting him beyond measure:
She had granted him the title of King; she had join∣ed
his name with her own in all public acts; she in∣tended
to have procured him from the states a matri∣monial
crown: But having leisure afterwards to remark
his weakness and vices, she began to see the danger of
her profuse liberality, and was resolved thenceforth to
proceed with more reserve in the trust which she should
confer upon him. His resentment against this pru∣dent
conduct, served but the more to encrease her dis∣gust;
and the young prince, enraged at her imagined
neglects, pointed his vengeance against every one
whom he esteemed the cause of this change in her
measures and behaviour.</P>
<P>THERE was in the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Rizzio.</NOTE> one David Rizzio who
had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of
confidence and favour with the Queen of Scots. He
was a Piedmontese, of mean birth, son to a teacher of
music, himself a musician; and finding it difficult to
subsist by his art in his own country, he had followed
into Scotland an ambassador whom the duke of Sa∣voy
sent thither to pay his compliments to Mary,
some time after her first arrival. He possssed a good
ear, and a tolerable voice; and as that princess found
him useful to compleat her band of music, she re∣tained
him in her service after the departure of his
master. Her secretary for French dispatches having,
some time after, fallen under her displeasure, she pro∣moted
Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent
opportunities of approaching her person, and insinuat∣ing
himself into her favour. He was shrewd and
sensible, as well as aspin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, much beyond his rank and
education; and made so good use of the access which
fortune had procured him, that he was soon regarded
as the chief confident and even minister of the Queen.
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
He was counsulted on all occasions; no favours could
be obtained but by his intercession; all suitors were
obliged to gain him by presents and flattery; and the
man, insolent from his new exaltation, as well as ra∣pacious
in his acquisitions, soon drew on himself the
hatred of the nobility, and of the whole kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 282. 302. Crawford's Memoirs, p. 5. Spotswood, p. 193.</NOTE>
He had at first employed his credit to promote Darn∣ley's
marriage; and a firm friendship seemed to be
established between them: But on the subsequent
change of the Queen's sentiments, it was easy for
Henry's friends to persuade him, that Rizzio was the
real author of her indifference, and even to rouze in
his mind jealousies of a more dangerous nature. The
favourite was of a disagreeable figure, but was not
past his youth<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan confesses he was ugly; but it may be inferred, from the narration of that author, that he was young. He says, that on the re∣turn of the duke of Savoy to Turin, Rizzio was <HI>in adolescentiae vigore;</HI> in the vigour of youth. Now that event happened only a few years before. Lib. xvii. cap. 44.</NOTE>; and tho' the opinion of his criminal
correspondence with Mary might seem of itself un∣reasonable,
if not absurd, a suspicious husband could
find no other means of accounting for that lavish and
imprudent kindness, with which she honoured him.
The rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, who could
admit of no freedoms, contriburted to spread this opini∣on
among the people; and as Rizzio was universal∣ly
believed to be a pensionary of the pope, and to be
deeply engaged in all schemes against the protestants,
any story to his and Mary's disadvantage, received an
easy credit among the zealots of that communion.</P>
<P>RIZZIO, who had connected his interest with the
Roman catholics, was the declared enemy of the ba∣nished
lords; and by promoting the violent prosecu∣tion
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>
against them, had exposed himself to the animo∣sity
of their numerous friends and reatainers. A scheme
was also thought to be formed for revoking some
exorbitant grants made during the Queen's minori∣ty;
and even the nobility, who had seized the eccle∣siastical
benefices, began to think themselves less
secure in the possession of them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 326. Melvil, p. 64.</NOTE> The earl of Mor∣ton,
chancellor, was affeted by all these considerati∣ons,
and still more by a rumour spread abroad, that
Mary intended to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his
place, and to bestow that dignity on a mean and up∣start
foreigner, who was ignorant of the laws and
language of the country<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Buchanan▪ lib. xvii. c. 60. Crawford, p. 6. Spotfwood, p. 194. Knox, p. 393. Jebb, vol. J. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> So indiscreet had this
princess been in her kindness to Rizzio, that even that
strange report met with credit, and proved a great means
of accelerating the ruin of the favourite. Morton,
insinuating himself into Henry's confidence, employ∣ed
all his art to enflame the discontent and jealousy of
that prince; and he persuaded him, that the only
means of freeing himself from the indignities under
which be laboured, was to bring the base stranger to
that fate which he had so well merited, and which
was so passionately desired by the whole nation.
George Douglas, natural brother to the countess of
Lenox, concurred in the same advice; and the lords
Ruthven and Lindesey, being consulted, offered their
concurrence in the enterprize; nor was even the earl
of Lenox, the King's father, averse to the design<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 7.</NOTE>
But as these conspirators were well acquainted with
Henry's levity, they engaged him to sign a paper, in
which he avowed the undertaking, and promised to
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
protect them against every consequence which might
ensue upon the assassination of Rizzio<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 266. Crawford, p. 7.</NOTE>. All these
measures being fully concerted, a messenger was dis∣patched
to the banished lords, who were hovering
near the borders; and they were invited by the King
to return to their native country.</P>
<P>THIS design, so atrocious in itself, was rendered still
more so by the circumstances which attended its exe∣cution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March.</NOTE> Mary, who was in the sixth month of her
pregnancy, was supping in private, and had at table
the countess of Argyle, her natural sister, with Riz∣zio,
and others of her servants. The King entered
the room by a private passage, and stood at the back
of Mary's chair: The lord Ruthven, George Doug∣las,
and other conspirators, being all armed, rushed
in after him; and the Queen of Scots, terrified with
the appearance, demanded of them the reason of this
rude intrusion. They told her, that they intended
no violence against her person; but meant only to
bring that villain, pointing at Rizzio, to his deserved
punishment. Rizzio, aware of the danger, ran be∣hind
his mistress, and seizing her by the waist, called
aloud to her for protection; while she interposed in
his behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties.
The impatient assassins, regardless of her efforts, rush∣ed
upon their prey, and by overturning every thing
which stood in their way, increased the horror and
confusion of the scene. Douglas, seizing Henry's
dagger, stuck it in the body of Rizzio, who, scream∣ing
with fear and agony, was torne from Mary by the
other conspirators, and pushed into the antichamber,
where he was dispatched with fifty-six wounds.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 64. Keith, p. 330, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>31. Crawford, p. 9.</NOTE> The
unhappy princess, informed of his fate, immediately
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
dried her tears, and said, she would weep no more;
she would now think of revenge. The insult, indeed,
upon her person; the stain attempted to be fixed on
her honour; the danger to which her life was exposed,
on account of her pregnancy; were injuries so atro∣cious,
and so complicated, that they scarce left room
for pardon, even from the greatest lenity and mercy.</P>
<P>THE assassins, apprehensive of Mary's tesentment, de∣tained
her a prisoner in the palace; and the King dis∣missed
all those who seemed willing to attempt her
rescue, by telling them, that nothing was done with∣out
his orders, and that he would be careful of the
Queen's safety. Murray, and the banished lords,
appeared two days after; and Mary, whose anger was
now engrossed by injuries more recent and violent,
was willingly reconciled to them; and she even recei∣ved
he brother with tenderness and affection. They
obtained an acquital from the Parliament, and were
re-instated in their honours and fortunes. The accom∣plices
also in Rizzio's murder applied to her for a par∣don;
but she artfully delayed compliance, and persuad∣ed
them, that so long as she was detained in custody,
and was surrounded by guards, any deed which she
should sign, would have no force nor validity. Mean∣while
she had gained the confidence of her husband,
by her persuasion and caresses; and no sooner were the
guards withdrawn, than she engaged him to escape
with her in the night time, and take shelter in Dun∣bar.
Many of her subjects here offered her their assis∣tance;
and Mary, having collected an army, which
the conspirators had no power to resist, advanced to
Edinburgh, and obliged them to fly into England,
where they lived in great poverty and distress. They
made applications, however, to the earl of Bothwel,
a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, desi∣sirous
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
to strengthen his party by the accession of their
interest, was able to pacify her resentment, and he soon
after procured them liberty to return into their own
country<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 75, 76. Keith, p. 334. Knox, p. 398.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE vengeance of the Queen of Scots was impla∣cable
against her husband alone, whose person was
before disagreeable to her, and who, by his violation of
every tie of gratitude and duty, had now drawn on
him her highest resentment. She engaged him to dis∣own
all connections with the assassins, to deny any
concurrence in their crime, even to publish a procla∣mation
containing a falsehood so notorious to the
whole world<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 280. Keith Appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 167.</NOTE>; and having thus made him expose
himself to universal contempt, and rendered it imprac∣ticable
for him ever to acquire the confidence of any
party, she threw him off with disdain and indignation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66, 67.</NOTE>
As if she had been making an escape from him, she
suddenly withdrew to Alloa, a seat of the earl of
Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and when Henry followed her thither, she re∣turned
suddenly to Edinburgh; and gave him every
where the strongest proofs of displeasure, and even of
antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers in their ne∣glect
of him; and she was pleased, that his mean equi∣page,
and small train of attendants, should draw on
him the contempt of the very populace. He was
permitted, however, to have apartments in the castle
of Edinburgh, which Mary had chosen for the place
of her delivery. She there brought forth a son; and as
this was very important news to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June.</NOTE> as well as
to Scotland, she immediately dispatched Sir James Mel∣vil
to carry intelligence of the happy event to Eliza∣beth.
Melvil tells us, that that princess, the evening
of his arrival in London, had given a ball to her court
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
at Greenwich, and was displaying all that spirit and
alacrity which usually attended her on these occasions:
But when the prince of Scotland's birth was notified
to her, all her joy was damped: She sunk into melan∣choly;
she reclined her head upon her arm; and com∣plained
to some of her attendants, that the Queen of
Scots was mother of a fair son, while she was but a bar∣ren
stock. Next day, however, on the reception of
the Scots ambassador, she resumed her former dissimula∣tion,
put on a joyful countenance, gave Melvil thanks
for the haste he had made in conveying to her the
agreeable intelligence, and expressed the utmost cor∣diality
and friendship to her sister<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 69, 70.</NOTE> Some time after
she dispatched the earl of Bedford, with her kinsman
George Cary, son to the lord Hunsdon, in order to
officiate at the baptism of the young prince; and she
sent by them some magnificent presents to the Queen
of Scots.</P>
<P>THE birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary's
partizans in England<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 397.</NOTE>; and even men of all parties
began to cry aloud for some settlement of the suc∣cession.
These humours broke out with great vehe∣mence
in a new session of Parlia∣ment, which was held
after six prorogations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th September. A Parliament.</NOTE> The house of peers, which
had hitherto forborne to touch on the delicate point of
the succession, here took the lead; and the house of
commons soon after imitated the zeal of the lords.
Molineux opened the matter in the lower house, and
proposed that the question of the succession and that
of supply should go hand in hand; as if it were intend∣ed
to constrain the Queen to a compliance with the
request of her Parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>29.</NOTE> The courtiers endeavour∣ed
to elude the debate: Sir Ralph Sadler told the
house, that he had heard the Queen positively affirm,
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
that, for the good of her people, she was determined
to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys
gave their testimony to the same purpose; as did also
Sir Ambrose Cave, chancellor of the dutchy, and Sir
Edward Rogers, comptroler of the houshold<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, p. 124.</NOTE> Eli∣zabeth's
ambitious and masculine character was so well
known, that few members gave any credit to this in∣telligence;
and it was considered merely as an artifice,
by which she endeavoured to retract that positive affir∣mation,
which she had made in the beginning of her
reign, that she meant to live and die a virgin. The
ministers therefore gained nothing farther by this piece
of policy, but only to engage the house, for the sake
of decency, to join the question of the Queen's mar∣riage
with that of a settlement of the crown; and the
commons were proceeding with great earnestness in the
debate, and had even appointed a committee to confer
with the lords, when express orders were brought them
from Elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter.
Cecil told them, that she pledged to the house the word
of a Queen for her sincerity in her intentions to marry;
that the appointment of a successor would be attended
with great danger to her person; that she herself had
had experience, during the reign of her sister, how
much court was paid to the next heir, and what dan∣gerous
sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make
of their present duty to their future prospects; and that
she was therefore determined to delay, till a more
proper opportunity, the decision of that important que∣stion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 127, 128.</NOTE> The house were not satisfied with these rea∣sons,
and still less with the command, prohibiting them
all debate on that snbject. Paul Wentworth, a spiri∣ted
member, went so far as to question whether such a
prohibition were not an infringement of the liberties
and privileges of the house<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 128.</NOTE> Some even ventured to
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
violate that profound respect which they had hitherto
preserved to the Queen; and affirmed that she was
bound in duty, not only to provide for the happiness of
her subjects during her own life, but also to pay regard
to their future security, by fixing a successor; that by
a contrary conduct, she showed herself the stepmother,
not the natural parent, of her people, and would seem
defirous, that England should no longer subsist than
she should enjoy the glory and satisfaction of govern∣ing
it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants,
or faint hearted women, ever stood in fear of their suc∣cessors;
and that the affections of the people were a
firm and impregnable rampart to every sovereign, who,
laying aside all artifice or by-ends, had courage and
magnanimity to put his sole trust in that honourable
and sure defence<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 400.</NOTE> The Queen, hearing of these de∣bates,
sent for the speaker, and after reiterating her
former prohibition, she bid him inform the house,
that, if any member remained still unsatisfied, he
might appear before the privy council, and there give
his reasons<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 128.</NOTE> As the members showed a disposition,
notwithstanding these peremptory orders, still to pro∣ceed
upon the question, Elizabeth thought proper, by
a message, to revoke them, and to allow the house li∣berty,
of debate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 130.</NOTE> They were so mollified by this
gracious condescension, that they thenceforth conduct∣ed
the matter with more calmness and temper; and
they even voted her a supply, to be levied at three pay∣ments,
of a subsidy and a fifteenth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567.</NOTE> without annexing
any condition to it. The Queen soon after dissolved
the Parliament, and told them with some sharpness in
the conclusion, that their proceedings had contained
much dissimulation and artifice; that under the plausi∣ble
pretences of marriage and succession, many of them
covered very malevolent intentions towards her; but
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567.</NOTE> however, she reaped this advantage from their
attempts that she could now distinguish her friends from
her enemies, “But do you think,” added she, “that
I am unmindful of your future security, or will be
negligent in settling the succession? That is the
chief object of my concern; as I know myself to
be liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortality. Or do you apprehend, that I
meant to in roach on your liberties? No: It was
never my m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning; I only intended to stop you be∣fore
you approached the precipice. All things have
their time; and tho' you may be blessed with a sove∣reign
more wise or more learned than I, yet I assure
you, that no one will ever rule over you, who
shall be more careful of your safety. And therefore,
henceforward, whether I live to see the like assem∣bly
or no, or whoever holds the reins of govern∣ment,
let me warn you to beware of provoking
your sovereign's patience, so far as you have done
mine. But I shall now conclude, notwithstanding
the disgusts I have received (for I mean not to part
with you in anger) that the greatest part of you may
assure themselves that they go home in their prince's
good graces<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wes. p. 116, 117.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>ELIZABETH carried farther her dignity on this occa∣sion.
She had received the subsidy without any con∣dition;
but as it was believed, that the commons had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ven her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eld to their requests, she thought proper, on her re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sal,
to remit voluntarily the third payment; and she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, that money in her subjects purses was as good as
in her own exchequer<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen was able to elude, for the pre∣sent,
the applications of Parliament, the friends of the
Queen of Scots multiplied every day in England; and
<PB N="107" REF="118"/>
besides the catholics, many of whom kept treasonable
correspondence with her, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e ready to rise at her
command<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Haynes. p. 446, 448.</NOTE>, the court itself of Elizabeth was full of
her avowed partizans. The duke of Norfolk, the
earls of Leicester, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumber∣land,
Sir Nicholas Throcmorton, and most of the con∣siderable
men in England, except Cecil, seemed con∣vinced
of the necessity of declaring her the successor.
None but the more zealous protestants adhered either
to the countess of Hertford, or to her aunt, Eleanor,
Countess of Cumberland; and as the marriage of the
former seemed liable to some objections, and had been
declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that side,
with the prospect of new disputes concerning the
succession. Mary's behaviour also, so moderate to∣wards
the protestants, and so gracious towards all men,
had procured her universal respect<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 53, 61, 74.</NOTE>; and the public
was willing to ascribe any imprudences, into which
she had fallen, to her youth and inexperience. But all
these flattering prospects were blasted by the subse∣quent
incidents, where her engregious indiscretions,
shall I say, or atrocious crimes, threw her from the
height of her prosperity, and involved her in infamy
and ruin.</P>
<P>THE earl of Bothwel was of a considerable family
and power in Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Darnley.</NOTE> and tho' not distinguished<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by
any talents either of a civil or military nature, he had
made a figure in that party, which opposed the great∣ness
of the earl of Murray, and the more rigid refor∣mers.
He was a man of profligate manners; had in∣volved
his opulent fortune in great debts, and even re∣duced
himself to beggary, by his profuse expences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 240.</NOTE>;
and seemed to have no resource but in desperate coun∣cils
and enterprizes. He had been accused more
than once of an attempt to assassinate Murray; and
notwithstanding that the frequency of these accusati∣ons
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>
on all sides diminish somewhat the credit due to
any particular imputation, they prove sufficiently the
prevalence of that detestable practice in Scotland, and
may in that view serve to render such rumours the
more likely and credible. This man had of late acqui∣red
the favour and entire confidence of Mary; and all
her measures were directed by his advice and authori∣ty.
Reports were spread of more particular intima∣cies
and familiarities between them; and these reports
gained ground from the continuance or rather encrease
of her hatred towards her husband<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66. 77.</NOTE> That young
prince was reduced to such a state of desperation, by
the neglects which he underwent from his Queen and
the courtiers, that he had once resolved to fly secretly
into France or Spain, and had even provided a vessel
for that purpose<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith. p. 345—348.</NOTE> Some of the most considerable no∣bility,
on the other hand, observing her fixed aversion
to him, had proposed some expedients for a divorce;
and tho' Mary is said to have spoken honourably on
that occasion, and to have embraced the proposal no
farther than it should be found consistent with her own
honour and her son's legitimacy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 404. Goodal's Queen Mary, vol. II. p. 317.</NOTE>, men were inclined
to believe, that the difficulty of finding proper means
for effectuating that purpose, was the real cause of
laying aside all farther thoughts of it. So far were
the suspicions against her carried, that, when Henry,
discouraged with the continual proofs of her hatred,
left the court and retired to Glasgow, an illness of an
extraordinary nature, with which he was seized imme∣diately
on his arrival in that place, was universally
ascribed by her enemies to a dose of poison, which, it
was pretended, she had administred to him.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="120"/>
WHILE affairs were on this footing, all those who
wished well to her character or the repose of their coun∣try,
were extremely pleased, and somewhat surprized,
to hear, that a friendship was again conciliated be∣tween
them, that she had taken a journey to Glasgow
on purpose to visit him during his sickness, that she
behaved towards him with great tenderness, that she
had brought him along with her, and that she appeared
thenceforth determined to live with him on a footing
more suitable to the connexions between them. Hen∣ry,
naturally uxorious, and not mistrusting this sud∣den
reconcilement, put himself implicitly into her
hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived in
the palace of Holy-rood-house; but as the situation
of that place was low, and the concourse of persons
about the court was necessarily attended with noise,
which might disturb him in his present infirm state of
health, these reasons were assigned for fitting up an
apartment for him in a solitary house, at some distance,
called the Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks
of kindness and attachment; she conversed cordially
with him; and she lay some nights in a room below
his; but on the ninth of February, she told him, that
she would pass that night in the palace, because the mar∣riage
of one of her servants was there to be celebrated
in her presence. About two o'clock in the morning
the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great
noise; and were still more astonished, when it was dis∣covered,
that the noise came from the King's house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Febru∣ary.</NOTE>
which was blown up by gun-powder; that his dead bo∣dy
was found at some distance in a neighbouring field;
and that no marks either of fire, contusion or violence
appeared upon it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">It was imagined, that Henry had been strangled before the house was blown up: But this supposition is contradicted by the confession of the cri∣minals; and there is no necessity to admit it in order to account for the con∣dition of his body. There are many instances that men's lives have been! saved who have been blown up in ships. Had Henry fallen on water he had not probably been killed</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="121"/>
No doubt could be entertained but Henry was mur∣dered; and the general conjecture soon pointed to∣wards
the earl of Bothwel as the author of that crime<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 78. Cabbala, p. 136.</NOTE>.
But as his favour with Mary was open and visible,
and his power great, no one ventured to declare open∣ly
his sentiments, and all men remained in silence and
mute astonishment. Voices, however, were heard in
the streets, during the darkness of the night, proclaim∣ing
Bothwel, and even Mary herself, to be the murder∣ers
of the King; placards were secretly affixed on the
walls to the same purpose; offers were made, that,
upon giving proper securities, his guilt should be open∣ly
proved: But after one proclamation from the court,
offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would
discover the author of that villainy, greater vigilance
was employed in searching out the spreaders of the li∣bels
and reports against Bothwel, and the Queen, than
in tracing the causes of the King's murder, or detect∣ing
the regicides<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Anderson's Collections vol. II. p. 38. vol <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 167, 168. Spotswood, p. 200. Keith, p. 374.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE earl of Lenox, who lived at a distance from
the court, in poverty and contempt, was rouzed by
the report of the son's murder, and wrote to the Queen,
imploring speedy justice against the assassins; among
whom he named the earl of Bothwel, Sir James Bal∣four,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Balfour his other, David Chal∣mers,
and four others of the Queen's houshold; all
of them persons who had been mentioned in the pla∣cards
affixed on the walls at Edinburgh<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 372. Anderson, vol. II. p. 3.</NOTE>. Mary took
his demand of speedy justice in a very literal sense;
and allowing only fifteen days for the examination of
this important affair, she sent a citation to Lenox, re∣quiring
him to appear in court, and prove his charge
<PB N="111" REF="122"/>
against Bothwel<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 373.</NOTE>. This nobleman, meanwhile,
and all the other persons, accused by Lenox, enjoyed
their full liberty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 374. 375.</NOTE>; Bothwel himself was continually
surrounded with armed men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 405.</NOTE>; took his place in coun∣cil<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. I. p. 38, 40, 50, 52.</NOTE>; lived during some time in the house with Mary<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. II. p. 274.</NOTE>;
and seemed to possess all his wonted confidence and
familiarity with her. Even the castle of Edinburgh,
a place of great consequence, in this critical time, was
entrusted to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had
himself been publickly charged as an accomplice in
the King's murder<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 201.</NOTE>. Lenox, who had come as far
as Stirling, with a view of appearing at the trial, was
informed of all these circumstances; and reflecting
on the small train, which attended him, he began to
entertain very just apprehensions from the power, inso∣lence,
and temerity of his ememy. He wrote to Mary,
desiring that the day of trial might be prorogued; and
conjured her, by all the regard which she bore to her
own honour, to employ more leisure and deliberation
in determining a question of such extreme moment<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith p. 375. Anderson, vol. I. p. 52.</NOTE>.
No regard was paid to his application: The jury was
enclosed, of which the earl of Caithness was chancellor;
and tho' Lenox, foreseeing this precipitation, had or∣dered
Cuningham, one of his retinue, to appear in court,
and protest in his name, against the acquital of the
criminal, the jury proceeded to a verdict<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 376. Anderson, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. p. 106 Spotswo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d, p. 201.</NOTE>. The ver∣dict
was such as it behoved them to give, where nei∣ther

the crime on the ninth of February, not the tenth,
the real day on which Henry was assassinated.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 375. Anderson, vol. II. p. 93. Spotswood, p. 20<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The
interpretation generally put upon this error, too gross,
it was thought, to have proceeded from mistake, was,
that the secret council by whom Mary was governed,
not trusting entirely to precipitation, violence, and
authoity, had provided this plea, by which they en∣sured,
at all adventures, a plausible pretence for acquit∣ing
Bothwel.</P>
<P>Two days after this extraordinary transaction, a Parli∣ament
was held; and tho' the sentence in favour of Both∣wel
was attended with such circumstances as strongly
confirmed, rather than diminished, the general opinion
of his guilt, he was the person chosen to carry the roy∣al
scepter on the first meeting of that national assem∣bly<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 78. Crawford, p. 14.</NOTE>. In this Parliament, a rigorous act was made
against those who set up defamatory placards; but no
notice was taken of the King's murder<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 380. The Queen, in order to gain the people, agreed to an act of Parliament, which established the protestant religion; a concession which she could never be∣fore be brought to make.</NOTE> The fa∣vour,
which Mary openly bore to Bothwel, kept eve∣ry
one in awe; and the effects of this terror appeared
more plainly in another transaction, which ensued im∣mediately
upon the dissolution of the Parliament. A
bond or association was framed; in which the subscri∣bers,
after relating the acquital of Bothwel by a legal
trial, and a farther offer, which he had made, to prove
his innocence by single combat, oblige themselves, in
case any person should afterwards impute to him the
King's murder, to support him with their whole pow∣er
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
against such calumniators. After this promise,
which implied no great assurance in Bothwel of his
own innocence, the subscribers mentioned the necessity
of their Queen's marriage, in order to support the go∣vernment;
and they recommended Bothwel to her as
a husband.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 381.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">24th April.</NOTE> This paper was subscribed by all the
considerable nobility there present. In a country, divi∣ded
by violent factions, such a concurrence in favour
of one nobleman, no wife distinguished above the rest,
except by his flagitious conduct, could never have been
obtained, had not every one been certain, at least firm∣ly
persuaded, that Mary was fully determined on this
measure.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mary herself confessed, in her instructions to the ambassadors, which she sent to France, that Bothwel persuaded all the noblemen, that their application in favour of his marriage was agreeable to her. Keith, p. 389. Anderson, vol. I. p. 94. Murray afterwards produced to Queen Eliza∣beth's commissioners a paper signed by Mary, by which she permitted them to make this application to her. This permission was sufficient decla∣ration of her intentions, and was esteemed equivalent to a command. An∣derson, vol. IV. p. 59. They even asserted, that the house, in which they met, was surr ounded with armed men. Goodal, vol. II. p. 141.</NOTE>. Nor would such a motive have sufficed
to influenced men, commonly so stubborn and intrac∣table,
had they not been taken by surprize, been ig∣norant
of each others sentiments, and overawed by
the present power of the court, and by the apprehensi∣ons
of farther violence, from persons so little govern∣ed
by any rules of honour and humanity. Even with
all these circumstances, the subscription to this paper
may justly be regarded as a repoach to the nation.</P>
<P>THE subsequent measures of Bothwel were equal∣ly
precipitate and audacious. Mary having gone to
Stirling to pay a visit to her son, he assembled a bo∣dy
of eight hundred horse, on pretence of pursuing
some robbers on the borders, and having way laid her
on her return, he seized her person near Edinburgh,
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
and carried her to Dunbar, with an avowed design of
forcing her to yield to his purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> Sir James Mel∣vil,
who was in her retinue, was carried along with
her; and says not, that he saw any signs of reluc∣tance
or constraint: He was even informed, as he tells
us by Bothwel's officers, that the whole transaction
was managed in concert with her<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 80.</NOTE>. A woman, in∣deed,
of that spirit and resolution, which is acknow∣ledged
to belong to Mary, does not usually, on these
occasions, give such marks of opposition to <HI>real</HI> vio∣lence,
as can appear anywise doubtful or ambiguous.
Some of the nobility, however, in order to put mat∣ters
to farther trial, sent her a private message; in
which they told her, that, if in reality she lay under
force, they would use all their efforts to relieve her.
Her answer was, that she had indeed been carried to
Dunbar by violence, but since her arrival had been so
well treated there, that she willingly remained with
Bothwel<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 202.</NOTE> No one gave themselves thenceforth any
solicitude to relieve her from a captivity, which they
believed to have proceeded entirely from her own ap∣probation
and connivance.</P>
<P>THIS unusual conduct was first ascribed to Mary's
sense of the infamy, attending her purposed marriage;
and her desire of finding some colour to gloss over
the irregularity of her conduct. But a pardon given
to Bothwel a few days afterwards, made the public
carry somewhat farther their conjectures. In this deed,
Bothwel received a pardon for the violence committed
on the Queen's person; and for <HI>all other crimes:</HI> A
clause, by which the murder of the King was indi∣rectly
pardoned. The rape was then conjectured to
have been only a contrivance of these politicians, in
order to afford a pretence for indirectly pardoning a
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
crime, of which they durst not openly make any
mention<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE events passed with such rapidity, that men
had no leisure to admire sufficiently one incident, when
they were surprized with a new one, equally rare
and uncommon. There still, however, remained one
difficulty, which, it was not easy to foresee, how the
Queen and Bothwel, determined as they were to exe∣cute
their shameful purpose, could find expedients to
overcome. The man, who had procured the subscrip∣tion
of the nobility, recommending him as a husband
to the Queen, and who had acted this seeming violence
on her person, in order to force her consent, had been
married six months before to another woman; to a
woman of merit, of a very noble family, sister to the
earl of Huntley. But persons blinded with passion,
and infatuated with crimes, soon shake off all appear∣ance
of decency. A suit was commenced for a divorce
between Bothwel and his wife; and this suit was open∣ed
at the same instant in two different, or rather oppo∣site
courts; in the court of the archbishop of St.
Andrews, which was popish, and governed itself by
the canon law; and in the new consistorial or commiss∣ariot
court, which was protestant, and was regulated
by the principles of the reformed teachers. The plea
advanced in each court, was so calculated as to suit
the principles which there prevailed: In the archbi∣shop's
court, the pretence of consanguinity was em∣ployed,
because Bothwel was related to his wife in the
fourth degree; in the commissariot court, the accusa∣tion
of adultery was made use of against him. The
parties too who applied for the divorce, were different
in the different courts: Bothwel was the person who
sued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the
suit in both courts was opened, pleaded, examined,
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
and decided with the utmost precipitation, and a sen∣tence
of divorce was pronounced in four days<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE divorce being thus obtained, it was thought
proper that Mary should be conducted to Edinburgh,
and should there appear before the courts of judica∣ture,
and should acknowledge herself to be restored to
entire freedom. This was understood to be contrived
with a view of obviating all doubts with regard to
the validity of her marriage. Orders were then gi∣ven
to publish the banns in the church, between the
Queen and the duke of Orkney; for that was the ti∣tle
which he now bore; and Craig, a minister of Edin∣burgh,
was applied to for that purpose. This clergy∣man,
not content with having, for some time, refused
compliance, publicly in his sermons condemned the
marriage; and exhorted all those who had access to
the Queen, to give her their advice against so scan∣dalous
an alliance. Being called before the coun∣cil,
to answer for this liberty, he showed a courage
which might cover all the nobles with shame, on ac∣count
of their tameness and servility. He said, that,
by the rules of the church, the earl of Bothwel, be∣ing
convicted of adultery, could not be permitted to
marry; that the divorce between him and his former
wife, was plainly procured by collusion, as appeared
by the precipitation of that sentence, and the sudden
conclusion of his marriage with the Queen; and that
all the suspicions which prevailed, with regard to the
King's murder, and the Queen's concurrence in the
former rape, would thence receive undoubted confir∣mation.
He therefore exhorted Bothwel, who was
present, no longer to persevere in his present crimi∣nal
enterprizes; and turning his discourse to the other
counsellors, he charged them to employ all their influ∣ence
with the Queen, in order to divert her from a
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
measure which would cover her with infamy and dis∣honour. Not satisfied even with this admonition, he
took the first opportunity of informing the public,
from the pulpit, of this whole transaction, and express∣ed
to them his fears, that, notwithstanding all remon∣strances,
their sovereign was still obstinately bent on
her satal purpose “For himself,” he said, “he had
already discharged his conscience, and yet again
would take heaven and earth to witness, that he
abhorred and detested that marriage, as scandalous
and hateful in the sight of mankind; But since
the Great, as he perceived, either by their flattery
or silence, gave countenance to the measure, he be∣sought
the Faithful to pray fervently to the Al∣mighty,
that a resolution, which was taken contrary to
all law, reason, and good conscience, might, by the
divine blessing, be turned to the comfort and benefit
of the church and kingdom.” These speeches of∣fended
the court extremely; and Craig was anew sum∣moned
before the council, to answer for his temerity
in thus passing the bounds of his commission. But
he told them, that the bounds of his commission
were the word of God, good laws, and natural reason;
and were the Queen's marriage tried by any of these
three standards, it would appear infamous and disho∣nourable,
and would be so esteemed by the whole
world. The council were so overawed by this heroic
behaviour in a private clergyman, that they dismissed
him without farther censure or punishment.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I Spotswood, p. 203. Anderson, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this transaction might have recalled Both∣wel
and the Queen of Scots, from their infatuation,
and might have instructed them in the dispositions of
the people, as well as in their own inability to oppose
them; they were still resolute to rush forward to
their own manifest destruction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 May.</NOTE> The marriage was
<PB N="118" REF="131"/>
solemnized by the bishop of Orkney, a protestant,
who was afterwards deposed by the church for this
scandalous compliance. Few of the nobility appear∣ed
at the ceremony; they had most of them, either
from shame or fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">51 May.</NOTE> retired to their own houses. The
French ambassador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen of Scots mar∣ries Bothwel.</NOTE> Le Croc, an aged gentleman of
honour and character, could not be prevailed on, tho'
a dependent of the house of Guise, to countenance the
marriage by his presence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 203. Melvil, p. 82.</NOTE>. Elizabeth remonstrated,
by very friendly letters and messages, against the mar∣riage<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 392. Digges, p. 14.</NOTE>: The court of France made like opposition;
but Mary, tho' on all other occasions she was extreme∣ly
obsequious to the advice of her relations in that
country, was here determined to pay no regard to their
opinion.</P>
<P>THE news of these transactions, being carried to
foreign countries, filled all Europe with amazement,
and threw infamy not only on the principal actors in
them, but also on the whole nation, who seemed, by
their submission and silence, and even by their declared
approbation, to give their sanction to these scandalous
practices<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p 82. Keith, p. 402. Anderson, vol. I. 128, 134.</NOTE>. The Scots, who resided abroad, met with
such reproaches, that they drust no where appear in
public; and they earnestly exhorted their countrymen
at home, to free them from the public odium, by
bringing to condign punishment the authors of such
atrocious crimes. This intelligence, with a little
more leisure for reflection, roused men at last from
their lethargy; and the rumours, which, from the very
beginning<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 11. Keith, Pref. p. 9.</NOTE>, had been spread against Mary, as if she
had concurred in the King's murder, seemed now, by
the subsequent transactions, to have received a strong
confirmation and authority. It was every where said,
that, even tho' no particular and direct proofs had as
<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
yet been produced of the Queen's guilt, the whole
tenor of her late conduct was sufficient, not only to
beget suspicion, but to prudce entire conviction against
her: That her sudden resolution of being reconciled
to her husband, whom before she had long and justly
hated; her bringing him to court, from which she had
banished him by neglects and rigours; her fitting up
separate apartments for him; were all of them circum∣stances,
which, tho' trivial in themselves, yet, being
compared with the following events, bore a very un∣favourable
aspect for her: That the least which, after
the King's murder, might have been expected in her
situation, was a more than usual caution in her mea∣sures,
and an extreme anxiety to punish the real
assassins, in order to free herself from all reproach and
suspicion: That no woman, who had any regard to
her character, would allow a man, publickly accused
of her husband's murder, so much as to approach her
presence, far less give him a share in her councils, and
cndow him with favour and authority: That an acquital
merely in the absence of accusers was very ill fitted to sa∣tisfy
the public; especially if that absence proceeded from
a designed precipitation of the sentence, and from the ter∣ror
which her known friendship for the criminal had in∣fused
into every one: That the very mention of her
marriage to such a person, in such circumstances, was
horrible; and the contrivances of extorting a consent
of the nobility, and of concerting a rape, were gross
artifices, more proper to discover her guilt than prove
her innocence: That where a woman thus shews a
consciousness of merited reproach, and, instead of cor∣recting,
provides only thin glosses to cover her excep∣tionable
conduct, she betrays a neglect of fame, which
must either be the effect or the cause of the most shame∣ful
enormities: That to espouse a man, who had a
few days before been so scandalously divorced from his
wife; who, to say the least, was believed to have, a
few months before, assassinated her husband, was so
<PB N="120" REF="133"/>
contrary to the plainest rules of behaviour, that no pre∣tence
of indiscretion or imprudence could account for
such a conduct: That a woman, who, so soon after
her husband's death, tho' not attended with any ex∣traordinary
circumstances, contracts a marriage which
might, in itself, be the most blameless, cannot, escape
severe censure; but one who overlooks, for her plea∣sure,
so many other weighty considerations, was
equally capable, in gratifying her appetites, to neglect
every regard to honour, and to humanity: That Mary
was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the pub∣lic,
with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences
which would every where be drawn from her conduct;
and therefore, if she still continued to pursue measures
which gave such just offence, she ratified, by her acti∣ons,
as much as by the most formal confession, all the
surmizes and imputations of her enemies: That the
only circumstance which opposed all these presump∣tions,
was, the benignity and goodness of her preced∣ing
behaviour, which seemed to remove her from all
suspicion of such atrocious inhumanity; but that the
characters of men were extremely variable, and the
persons who were guilty of the worst actions, were
not always naturally of the worst and most criminal
dispositions; That a woman, who, in a critical and
dangerous moment, had sacrificed her honour to a man
of abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led
blindfold by him to the commission of the most enor∣mous
crimes, and was in reality no longer at her own
disposal: And that tho' one supposition was still left
to alleviate her blame, viz. that Bothwel, presum∣ing
on her affection towards him, had of himself com∣mitted
the crime, and had never communicated it to
her, yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man
whom she had long known, could not easily be ac∣counted
for, without supposing some degree of preced∣ing
guilt; and as it appeared that she was not after∣wards
<PB N="121" REF="134"/>
restrained, either by shame or prudence, from
incurring the highest reproach and danger, it was not
likely, that a sense of duty or humanity would have a
more powerful influence over her.</P>
<P>THESE were the sentiments which prevailed through∣out
Scotland; and as the protestant teachers, who had
great authority, had long borne a great animosity to∣wards
Mary, the opinion of her guilt was, by that
means, the more widely diffused, and made the deeper
impression on every one. Some attempts made by
Bothwel, and, as it pretended, with her consent,
to get the young prince into his power, excited the
most serious attention; and the principal nobility, even
many of those who had formerly been constrained to
sign the application in favour of Bothwel's marriage,
met at Stirling, and formed an association for protect∣ing
the prince, and punishing the Kings murderers<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 394</NOTE>.
The earl of Athole himself, a known catholic was
the first author of this confederacy: The earls of Ar∣gyle,
Morton, Mar, Glencarne, the lords Boyd,
Lindesey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of Grange, Tul∣libardine,
and secretary Lidington, entered zealously
into it. The earl of Murray, foreseeing such turbu∣lent
times, and being desirous to keep free of these
dangerous factions, had, some time before, desired
and obtained Mary's permission to retire into France.</P>
<P>LORD Hume was first in arms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrecti∣ons in Scot∣land.</NOTE> and leading a body
of eight hundred horse, suddenly invironed the Queen
of Scots and Bothwel, in the castle of Borthwic. They
found means to make their escape to Dunbar; while
the confederate lords were assembling their troops at
Edinburgh, and taking measures to effectuate their
purpose. Had Bothwel been so prudent as to keep
within the fortess of Dunbar, his enemies must have
been dissipated for want of pay and subsistance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th June.</NOTE> but
hearing that the lords were fallen into distress, he was
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
so rash as to take the field, and advance towards them.
The armies met at Carberry Hill, about six miles from
Edinburgh; and Mary became soon sensible, that her
own troops disapproved of her cause, and were averse
to spend their blood in the quarrel<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 402. Spotswood, p. 207.</NOTE> After some bra∣va
does of Bothwel, where he discovered very little
courage, she saw no resource but that of holding a
conference with Kirkaldy of Grange, and of putting
herself, upon some general promises, into the hands of
the confederates. She was conducted to Edinburgh,
amidst the insults of the populace, who reproached her
with her crimes, and even held before her eyes, which
ever way she turned, a banner, on which was painted
the murder of her husband, and the distress of her in∣fant
son<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 83, 84.</NOTE> Mary, overwhelmed with her calamities,
had recourse to tears and lamentations. Mean while
Bothwel, during her conference with Grange, fled un∣attended
to Dunbar; and fitting out a few small ships,
set sail for the Orkneys, where he subsisted during some
time by pyracy. He was pursued thither by Grange,
and his ship was taken, with several of his servants,
who afterwards discovered all the circumstances of the
King's murder, and were punished for the crime<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 165, 166, &amp;c.</NOTE>
Bothwel himself escaped in a boat, and found means to
get a passage to Denmark, where he was thrown into
prison, lost his senses, and died miserably about ten
years afterwards: An end worthy of his flagitious con∣duct
and behaviour.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprison∣ment of Mary.</NOTE>, now in the hands of an en∣raged
faction, met with such treatment as a sovereign
may naturally expect from subjects who have their future
fears to provide against, as well as their present animosi∣ty
to gratify. It is pretended, that she behaved with a
spirit very little suitable to her condition, avowed her
inviolable attachment to Bothwel<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 419.</NOTE>, and even wrote
him a letter, which the lords intercepted, where she
declared, that she would endure any extremity,
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
nay, resign her dignity and power, rather than relin∣quish
his affections<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 84. The reality of this letter appears somewhat disput∣able; chiefly because Murray and his associates never mentioned it in their accusation of her before Queen Elizabeth's commissioners.</NOTE> The malecontents finding the
danger to which they were exposed, in case Mary should
finally prevail, thought themselves obliged to proceed
with rigour against her; and they sent her next day
under a guard to the castle of Lochlevin, situated in a
lake of that name. The mistress of the house was mo∣ther
to the earl of Murray; and as she pretended to
have been lawfully married to the late King of
Scots, she naturally bore an animosity to Mary,
and treated her with the utmost harshness and
severity.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was exactly informed of all those
events, seemed touched with compassion rowards the
unfortunate Queen; and all her fears and jealousies
being now laid asleep, by the consideration of that ruin
and infamy in which Mary's conduct had involved
her, she began to reflect on the instability of human
affairs, the precarious state of royal grandeur, the dan∣ger
of encouraging rebellious subjects; and she resolved
to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities
of her unhappy sister. She sent Sir Nicholas Throc∣morton
ambassador to Scotland, in order to remonstrate
both with Mary and the associated lords; and she gave
him instructions which, tho' mixt with some lofty pre∣tensions,
were full of that good sense which was so
natural to her, and of that generosity which the pre∣sent
interesting situation had called forth. She em∣powered
him to declare in her name to Mary, that the
late conduct of that princess, so enormous, and in
every respect so unjustifiable, had given her the highest
offence; and tho' she felt the movements of pity to∣wards
her, she had once determined never to interpose
in her affairs, either by advice or assistance, but to
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
abandon her entirely, as a person whose condition was
totally desperate, and honour irretrieveable: That
she was well assured, that other foreign princes,
Mary's near relations, had embraced the same resolu∣tion;
but, for her part, the late events had touched
her heart with more tender sympathy, and had made
her adopt measures more favourable to the liberty and
interests of the unhappy Queen: That she was de∣termined
not to see her oppressed by her rebellious sub∣jects,
but would employ all her good offices, and even
her power, to redeem her from captivity, and place her
in such a condition as would at once be compatible
with her dignity, and the safety of her subjects: That
she entreated her to lay aside all thoughts of revenge,
except against the murderers of her husband; and as
she herself was his near relation, she was better entitled
than the subjects of Mary to interpose her authority on
that head, and she therefore besought that princess, if
she had any regard to her own honour and safety, not
to oppose so just and reasonable a demand: That after
those two points were provided for, her own liberty,
and the punishment of her husband's assassins, the safety
of her infant son was next to be considered; and there
seemed no expedient more proper for that purpose, than
the sending him to be educated in England: And that,
besides the security which would attend his removal
from all factions and convulsions, there were many
other beneficial consequences, which it was easy to
foresee as the result of his education in that coun∣try<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 411, 412, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remonstrances which Throcmorton was in∣structed
to make to the associated lords, were entirely
conformable to these sentiments which Elizabeth enter∣tained
in Mary's favour. She empowered him to tell
them, that whatever blame she might throw on Mary's
conduct, any opposition to their sovereign was totally
<PB N="125" REF="138"/>
unjustifiable, and incompatible with all order and
good government: That it belonged not to them to
reform, much less to punish, the mal-administration
of their prince; and the only arms which subjects could
in any case lawfully employ against the supreme autho∣rity,
were entr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aties, counsels, and representations:
That if these expedients failed, they were next to ap∣peal
by their prayers to Heaven; and to wait with pa∣tience
till the Almighty, in whose hands are the hearts
of princes, should be pleased to turn them to justice
and to mercy. That she inculcated not this doctrine
because she herself was interested in its observance;
but because it was universally received in all well go∣verned
states, and was essential to the preservation of
civil society: That she required them to restore their
Queen to liberty; and promised, in that case, to con∣cur
with them in all proper expedients for regulating
the government, for punishing the King's murderers,
and for guarding the life and liberty of the infant
prince: And that if the services which she had lately
conferred on the Scotish nation, in protecting them
from foreign usurpation, were duly considered by them,
they would repose confidence in her good offices, and
would esteem themselves blame-worthy, in never hav∣ing
as yet made any application to her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 414, 415, 429.</NOTE></P>
<P>ELIZABETH, besides these remonstrances, sent, by
Throcmorton some articles of accommodation, which
he was to propose to both parties, as expedients for
the settlement of public affairs; and tho' these articles
included some considerable restraints on the sove∣reign
power, they were in the main calculated for
Mary's advantage, and were sufficiently indulgent to
her<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 416.</NOTE> The associated lords, who were determined to
proceed with greater severity, were apprehensive of
Elizabeth's partiality; and being sensible, that Ma∣ry
would take courage from the protection of that
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
powerful princess<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 427.</NOTE>, they thought proper, after seve∣ral
affected delays, to refuse the English ambassador
all access to her person. There were four differ∣ent
schemes proposed in Scotland, for the treatment
of the captive Queen: One, that she should be re∣stored
to her authority under very strict limitations;
The second, that she should be obliged to resign her
crown to the prince, be banished the kingdom, and
be confined either to France or England; with assur∣ances
from the sovereign in whose dominions she
should reside, that she should make no attempts to
the disturbance of the established government: The
third, that she should be publickly treid for her crimes,
of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted
proofs, and be condemned to perpetual imprisonment:
The fourth was still more severe, and required
that, after her condemnation, capital punishment
should be inflicted upon her<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 420.</NOTE> Throcmorton sup∣ported
the mildest proposal; but tho' he promised his
mistress's guarantee for the performance of articles,
threatned them with immediate vengeance in case of
refusal<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 428.</NOTE>, and warned them not to draw on them
selves, by their violence, the public reproach, which
now lay upon the Queen; he found, that except∣ing
secretary Lidington, he had not the good for
tune to convince any of the leaders. All councils
seemed to tend towards the more severe expedients;
and the preachers, in particular, drawing their ex∣amples
from the rigorous maxims of the Old Testa∣ment,
which can only be warranted by particular re∣velations,
inflamed the minds of the people against
their unhappy sovereign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422, 426.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE were several pretenders to the regency of
the young prince, after the intended deposition of
Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that authority as
<PB N="127" REF="140"/>
grandfather to the prince: The duke of Chatelraut,
who was absent in France, had pretensions as next
heir to the crown: But the greatest number of the asso∣ciated
lords inclined to the earl of Murray, in whose
capacity they had the greatest trust, and who possess∣ed
the entire confidence of the preachers and more
zealous reformers. All measures being therefore con∣certed,
three instruments were sent to Mary, by the
hands of Lord Lindesey and Sir Robert Melvil; by
one of which she was to resign the crown in favour
of her son, by another to appoint Murray regent, by
the third to name a Council, which should administer
the government till his arrival in Scotland. The
Queen of Scots, seeing no prospect of relief, lying
justly under apprehensions of her life, and believing,
that no deed, which she executed during her capti∣vity,
could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plenti∣ful
effusion of tears, to sign these three instruments;
and she took not the trouble of inspecting any one
of them<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 85. Spotswood, p. 211. Anderson, vol. III. p. 19.</NOTE> In consequence of this forced resignation,
the young prince was proclaimed King, under the
name of James the sixth. He was soon after crown∣ed
at Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th July.</NOTE> and the earl of Morton took in his
name the coronation-oath; in which a promise to ex∣tirpate
heresy was not forgot. Some republican pre∣tensions
in favour of the people's power were coun∣tenanced
in this ceremony<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 439, 440.</NOTE>; and a coin was soon
struck, on which the famous saying of Trajan was in∣scribed,
<HI>Pro me; si merear, in me:</HI> For me; if I de∣serve
it, against me<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 440. Appen. p. 150.</NOTE> Throcmorton had orders from
his mistress not to assist at the coronation of the King
of Scots<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 430.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE council of regency had not long occasion to
exercise their authority, The earl of Murray arrived
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
from France, and took possession of his high office.
He paid a visit to the captive Queen; and spoke to
her in a manner which better suited her past con∣duct
than her present condition. This harsh treat∣ment
quite extinquished in her breast any remains
of affection towards him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 87. Keith, p. 445.</NOTE> Murray proceeded af∣terwards
to break, in a more public manner, all terms
of decency with her. He summoned a Parliament;
and that assembly, after voting that she was undoubt∣edly
an accomplice in her husband's murder, condemn∣ed
her to imprisonment, ratified her dimission of the
crown, and acknowleged her son for King, and Mur∣ray
for regent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 206. seq.</NOTE> The regent, who was a man of vi∣gour
and abilities, employed himself successfully in
reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir James Bal∣four
to surrender the castle of Edinburgh: He con∣strained
the garrison of Dunbar to open their gates:
And he demolished that fortress.</P>
<P>BUT tho' every thing thus bore a favourable as∣pect
to the new government, and all men seemed to
submit to Murray's authority; a violent revolution,
however necessary, can never be effected without great
discontents; and it was not likely that in a country,
where the government, in its most settled state, pos∣sessed
a very disjointed authority, a new establish∣ment
should meet with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o interruption or disturbance.
Few considerable men of the nation seemed wil∣ling
to support Mary, so long as Bothwel was present;
but the removal of that obnoxious nobleman had al∣tered
the sentiments of many. The duke of Cha∣telraut,
being disappointed of the regency, bore no
good will to Murray and his counfellors; and the
same sentiments were embraced by all his numerous
retainers: Several of the nobility, finding that others
had taken the lead among the associators, formed a
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
faction apart, and opposed the prevailing power:
And besides some remains of duty and affection to∣wards
Mary; the malecontent lords, finding every thing
carried to extremity against her, were naturally led to
embrace her cause, and shelter themselves under her
authority. All those, who retained any propensity
to the catholic religion, were inclined to join this par∣ty;
and even the people in general, tho' they had
formerly either detested Mary's crimes, or blamed her
imprudence, were now moved by her misfortunes
to compassionate her present situation, and lamented;
that a person, possessed of so many amiable accom∣plishments,
joined to such high dignity, should be
treated with such extreme rigour and severity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xviii. c. 53.</NOTE> Ani∣mated
by all these motives, many of the principal no∣bility,
now adherents to the Queen of Scots, met
at Hamilton, and concerted measures for supporting
the cause of that princess.</P>
<P>WHILE these humours were in fermentation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE>
Mary was employed in contrivances for effecting her
esape; and she engaged, by her charms and caresses,
a young gentleman, George Douglas, brother to the
laid of Lochlevin, to assist her in that enterprize.
She even went so far as to give him hopes of espous∣ing
her, after her marriage with Bothwel should be
dissolved on the plea of force; and she proposed this
expedient to the regent, who rejected it. Douglas,
however, persevered in his endeavours to free her
from captivity; and having all opportunities of access
to the house, he was at last successful in the under∣taking.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d May.</NOTE>
He conveyed her in disguise into a small
boat, and himself rowed her ashore. She hastened to
Hamilton; and the news of her arrival in that place
being immediately spread abroad, many of the nobility
flocked to her with their forces. A bond of associa∣tion
for her defence was signed by the earls of Ar∣gyle,
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
Huntley, Eglington, Crawford, Cassiles, Rothes,
Montrose, Southerland, Errol, nine bishops, and
nine barons, besides many of the most considerable
gentry<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 475.</NOTE> And in a few days an army, to the num∣ber
of six thousand men, was assembled under her
standard.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was no sooner informed of Mary's
escape, than she discovered her resolution of perse∣vering
in the same generous and friendly measures,
which she had hitherto pursued. If she had not
employed force against the regent, during the impri∣sonment
of that princess, she had been chiefly with∣held
by the fear of pushing him to greater extremities
against her<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 463. Cabbala, p. 141.</NOTE>; but she had proposed to the court of
France an expedient, which, tho' less violent, would
have been no less effectual for her service: She de∣sired
that France and England should by concert cut
off all commerce with the Scots, till they should do
justice to their injured sovereign<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 462.</NOTE> She now dis∣patched
Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good
offices, and the assistance of her force to Mary; but
as she was apprehensive of the entrance of French
troops into the kingdom, she desired that the contro∣versy
between the Queen of Scots and her subjects
might by that princess be referred entirely to her ar∣bitration,
and that no foreign succours should be in∣troduced
into Scotland<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 473. in the notes. Anderson. vol. IV. p. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT Elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her
offorts in favours of Mary. The regent made haste
to assemble forces; and notwithstanding that his army
was inferior in number to that of the Queen of Scots,
he took the field against her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> A battle was fought at
Langside near Glasgow, which was entirely decisive
in favour of the associated lords; and tho' the regent,
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
after his victory, stopt the bloodshed, yet was the
action followed by a total dispersion of the Queen's
party. That unhappy princess fled southwards from
the field of battle with great precipitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary flies into Eng∣land.</NOTE> and came,
with a few attendants, to the borders of England. She
here deliberated concerning her next measures, which
would probably prove so important to her future hap∣piness
or misery. She found it impossible to remain
in her own kingdom: She had an aversion, in her
present wretched condition, to return into France,
where she had formerly appeared with so much splen∣dour;
and was not, besides, provided of a vessel, which
could safely convey her thither: The late generous
behaviour of Elizabeth made her hope for defence,
and even assistance, from that quarter<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jebb's Collection, vol. I. p. 420.</NOTE>; and as the
present fears of her domestic enemies were the most
urgent, she overlooked all other considerations, and
embraced the resolution of taking shelter in Eng∣land.
She embarked on board a fishing-boat in Gal∣loway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE>
and landed the same day at Wirkington in
Cumberland, about thirty miles distant from Carlisle;
whence she immediately dispatched a messenger to
London; notifying her arrival, desiring liberty to vi∣sit
Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in conse∣quence
of former professions of friendship, made her
by that princess.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found herself in a situation, when
it was become necessary to take some decisive resolu∣tion
with regard to her treatment of the Queen of
Scots; and as she had hitherto, contrary to the opini∣on
of Cecil, attended more to the motives of genero∣sity
than of policy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 140.</NOTE>, she was engaged by that prudent
minister to weigh anew all the considerations, which
occurred in this critical conjuncture. He represented,
that the party, which had dethroned Mary, and had at
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
present assumed the government of Scotland, were
always the partizans of the English alliance, and
were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of
interest, to persevere in their connexions with Eliza∣beth:
That tho' Murray and his friends might com∣plain
of some unkind usage during their banishment
in England; they would easily forget these grounds of
quarrel, when they considered, that Elizabeth was the
only ally, on whom they could safely rely, and that
their own Queen, by her attachment to the catholic
faith, and by her other connexions, excluded them en∣tirely
from the friendship of France, and even from that
of Spain: That Mary, on the other hand, even before
her violent breach with her protestant subjects, was in
secret entirely governed by the counsels of the house
of Guise; much more, would she implicity comply
with their views, when by her own misconduct the
power of that family and of the zealous catholics was
become her sole resource and security: That her pre∣tensions
to the English crown would render her a
very dangerous instrument in their hands▪ and, were
she once able to suppress the protestants in her own
kingdom, she would unite the Scots and English ca∣tholics,
with those of all foreign states, in one con∣federacy
against the religion and government of Eng∣land:
That it behoved Elizabeth therefore to proceed
with caution in the design of restoring her rival to the
throne; and to take care, both that that enterprize,
if undertaken, should be effected by English forces
alone, and that full securities should beforehand be
provided for the reformers and the reformation in
Scotland: That above all, it was requisite to guard
carefully the person of that princess; lest, finding this
unexpected reserve in the English friendship, she
should suddenly take the resolution of flying into
France, and should attempt by foreign force to recover
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
possession of her authority:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563.</NOTE> That her desperate fortunes
and broken reputation fitted her for any attempt;
and her resentment, when she should find herself thus
defected by the Queen, would concur with her ambi∣tion
and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting,
as well as powerful, enemy to the English govern∣ment:
That if she was once abroad, in the hands of
enterprizing catholics, the attack of England would
appear to her as easy as that of Scotland; and the only
method, she must imagine, of recovering her native
kingdom, would be to acquire that crown, to which
she would esteem herself equally intitled: That a
neutrality in such interesting situations, tho' it might
be pretended, could never, without the most extreme
danger, be upheld by the Queen; and the detention
of Mary was equally requisite, whether the power of
England were to be employed in her favour, or
against her: That nothing indeed was more becoming
a great prince than generosity; yet the suggestions of
this noble principle could never, without the utmost im∣prudence,
be consulted in such delicate circumstances
as those in which the Queen was at present placed;
where her own safety and the interests of her people
were intimately concerned in every resolution which
she embraced: That tho' the example of successful
rebellion, especially in a neighbouring country, could
be no wise agreeable to any sovereign, yet Mary's im∣prudence
had been so great, perhaps her crimes so
enormous, that the insurrection of subjects, after such
provocation, could no longer be regarded as a prece∣dent
against other princes: That it was first necessa∣ry
for Elizabeth to ascertain, in a regular and satisfac∣tory
manner, the extent of Mary's guilt, and thence
to determine the degree of protection which she ought
to afford her, against her discontented subjects: That
as no glory could surpass that of defending oppressed
innocence, it was equally infamous to patronize vice
<PB N="134" REF="147"/>
and murder on the throne; and the contagion of such
dishonour, would extend itself to all who countenanced
or supported it: And that if the crimes of the Scottish
princess should, on enquiry, appear as great and cer∣tain
as was affirmed and believed, every measure
against her, which policy should dictate, would thence
be justified; or if she should be found innocent, every
enterprize, which friendship should inspire, would be
acknowledged laudable and glorious.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to these views, Elizabeth resolved to
proceed in a seemingly friendly, but really cautious
manner, with the Queen of Scots; and she immedi∣ately
sent orders to Lady Scrope, sister to the duke of
Norfolk, a lady who lived in the neighbourhood, to
attend on that princess. Soon after she dispatched
to her the lord Scrope himself, warden of the marches,
and Sir Francis Knolles, vice chamberlain. They
found Mary already lodged in the castle of Carlisle;
and after expressing the Queen's sympathy with her
in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her request
of being allowed to visit their sovereign, and of be∣ing
admitted to her presence, could not at present
be complied with: Till she had cleared herself of her
husband's murder, of which she was so strongly ac∣cused.
Elizabeth could not without dishonour show
her any countenance, or appear indifferent to the assassi∣nation
of so near a kinsman<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p. 54, 65, 82, 83, 86.</NOTE> So unexpected a check
threw Mary into tears; and the necessity of her situa∣tion
extorted from her a declaration, that she would
willingly justify herself to her sister from all imputa∣tions,
and would submit her cause to the arbitration
of so good a friend<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10, 55, 87.</NOTE>. Two days after, she sent lord
Herreis to London with a letter to the same pur∣pose.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="148"/>
THIS concession which Mary could scarce avoid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568</NOTE>
without an acknowledgement of guilt, was the point
expected and desired by Elizabeth: She immediately
dispatched Midlemore to the regent of Scotland;
requiring him both to desist from the farther prosecu∣tion
of his Queen's party, and to send some persons
to London to justify his conduct with regard to her.
Murray might justly be startled at receiving a message,
which must have appeared somewhat imperious; but
as his domestic enemies were numerous and power∣ful,
and England was the sole ally, which he could
expect among foreign nations, he was resolved ra∣ther
to digest the affront than provoke Elizabeth by
a refusal. He also considered, that tho' that Queen
had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, her interest
evidently engaged her to support the King's cause in
Scotland; and it was not to be doubted but that
penetrating princess would in the end discover this
advantage, and would at least afford him a patient
and equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he
would himself take a journy into England, atten∣ded
with other commissioners, and would willingly
submit the determination of his cause to Eliza∣beth<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p. 13—16.</NOTE></P>
<P>LORD Herreis now perceived, that his mistress
had advanced too far in her concessions: He endeavour∣ed
to maintain, that Mary could not, without dimi∣nution
of her royal dignity, submit to a contest with
her rebellious subjects before a foreign prince; and he
required either present aid from England, or liberty
for his Queen to pass over into France. Being pressed,
however, with the former agreement before the Eng∣lish
council, he again renewed his consent; but in
a few days he began anew to recoil, and it was with
some difficulty that he was brought to acquiesce in
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
the first determination<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Anderson, p. 16—20.</NOTE> These fluctuations, which
were incessantly renewed, showed his visible reluc∣tance
to the measures pursued by the court of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>THE
Queen of Scots discovered on less aversion to
the trial proposed; and it required all the artifice and
prudence of Elizabeth to make her persevere in the
agreement to which she had at first consented. This
latter princess still said to her, that she desired not,
without Mary's consent and approbation, to enter into
this question, and pretended only as a friend to hear
her justification: That she was confident there would
be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of
her enemies; and even if her apology should fall short
of full conviction, Elizabeth was determined to sup∣port
her cause, and procure her some reasonable terms
of accommodation: And that it was never meant, that
she should be cited to a trial on the accusation of her
rebellious subjects, but on the contrary, that they
should be summoned to appear and justify themselves
for their conduct towards her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11. 12, 13, 109, 110.</NOTE> Allured by these
plausible professions, the Queen of Scots agreed to
justify herself by her own commissioners before com∣missioners
which should be appointed by Elizabeth.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions, the lord Scrope and Sir
Francis Knolles; who resided with Mary at Carlisle,
had leizure to study her character, and to make re∣port
of it to Elizabeth. Unbroken by her misfortunes,
resolute in her purpose, active in her enterprizes, she
aspired to nothing but victory, and was determined to
endure any extremity, to undergo any difficulty, and
to try every fortune, rather than abandon her cause,
or yield the superiority to her enemies. Eloquent, in∣sinuating,
affable; she had already convinced all those
who approached her, of the innocence of her past con∣duct,
and as she declared her fixed purpose to require
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
aid of her friends all over Europe, and even to have
recourse to infidels and barbarians, rather than fail of
vengeance against her persecutors, it was easy to foresee
the danger to which her charms, her spirit, her address,
if allowed to operate with their full force, would expose
them<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. p. 54, 71, 72, 74, 78, 92.</NOTE> The court of England, therefore, who under
pretence guarding her, had already, in effect, detained
her close prisoner, were determined to watch her with
still greater vigilance. As Carlisle, by its situation on
the borders, afforded her great opportunities for con∣triving
her escape, they removed her to Bolton, a seat
of lord Scrope's in Yorkshire: And the issue of the
controversy between her and the Scots nation was re∣garded
as a subject more momentous to Elizabeth's
security and interests, than it had ever hitherto been
apprehended.</P>
<P>THE persons, appointed by the English court for
the examination of this great cause, were the duke of
Norsolk, the earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler;
and York was named as the place of conference. Les∣ley,
bishop of Ross, the lords Herreis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th October.</NOTE> Levingstone
and Boyde, with five persons more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferences at York and Hampton∣court.</NOTE> appeared as com∣missioners
from the Queen of Scots. The earl of
Murray, regent, the earl of Morton, the bishop of
Orkney, lord Lindesey, and the abbot of Dunfermling
were appointed commissioners from the King and king∣dom
of Scotland. Secretary Ledington, George Bu∣chanan,
the famous poet and historian, with some others,
were named as their assistants.</P>
<P>IT was a great circumstance of Elizabeth's glory,
that she was thus chosen umpire between the factions
of a neighbouring kingdom, which had, during many
centuries, entertained the most violent jealousy and
animosity against England; and her felicity was equally
rare, in having the fortune and fame of so dangerous
a rival, who had long given her the greatest inquietude,
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
now entirely at her disposal. Some circumstances of
her late conduct had discovered a byass towards the
side of Mary: Her prevailing interests led her to fa∣vour
the enemies of that princess: The professions of
impartiality, which she had made, were open and fre∣quent;
and she had so far succeeded, that each side ac∣cused
her commissioners of partiality towards their ad∣versaries<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 40.</NOTE> She herself appears, by the instructions
given them, to have fixed no plan for the decision; but
she new, that the advantages, which she should reap,
must be great, whatever issue the cause should take.
If Mary's crimes could be ascertained by undoubted
proof, she could for ever blast the reputation of that
princess, and might justifiably detain her for ever a
close prisoner in England: If the evidence fell short of
conviction, it was proposed to restore her to her throne,
but with such strict limitations, as would leave Eli∣zabeth
perpetual arbiter of all differences between the
parties in Scotland, and render her in effect absolute
mistress of that Kingdom.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 14, 15, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 110.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY's commissioners, before they gave in their
complaints against her enemies in Scotland, entered a
protest, that their appearance in the cause should no
wise affect the independance of her crown, or be con∣strued
as a mark of subordination to England: The
English commissioners received this protest, but with
a reserve to the claim of England. The complaint of
that princess was next read, and contained a detail of
all the injuries, which she had suffered, since her mat∣riage
with Bothwel: That her subjects had taken arms
against her, on pretence of freeing her from captivity;
that when she put herself into their hands, they had
committed her to close custody in Lochlevin; had
crowned her son, an infant, in her place; had again
taken arms against her after her delivery from prison;
<PB N="139" REF="152"/>
had rejected all her proposals for accommodation; had
given battle to her troops; and had obliged her, for the
safety of her person, to take shelter in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol, IV. part 2. p. 52. Goodall, vol. II. p. 128. Haynes, p. 478</NOTE>.
The earl of Murray, in answer to this complaint,
gave a summary and imperfect account of the late trans∣actions:
That the earl of Bothwel, the known mur∣derer
of the late King, had, a little time after the com∣mission
of that crime, seized the person of the Queen
and led her to Dunbar; that he acquired such influence
over her as to gain her consent to marry him, and he
had accordingly procured a divorce from his former
wife, and had pretended to celebrate his marriage
with the Queen; that the scandal of this transaction,
the dishonour which it brought on the whole nation,
the danger to which the infant prince was exposed
from the attempts of that audacious man, had obliged
the nobility to take arms, and oppose his criminal
designs and enterprizes; that after the Queen, in order
to save him, had thrown herself into their hands, she
still discovered such a violent attachment to him, that
they found it necessary, for their own and the public
fasety, to confine her person, during a season, till Both∣wel
and the other munderers of her husband could be
tried and punished for their crimes; and that during
this confinement, she had voluntarily, without com∣pulsion
or violence, merely from disgust at the in∣quietude
and vexations attending power, resigned her
crown to her only son, and had appointed the earl of
Murray regent during the minority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 64 &amp; seq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 144.</NOTE> The Queen's
answer to this apology was obvious: That she did not
know and never could suspect, that Bothwel, who had
been acquitted by a jury, and recommended to her by
all the nobility for her husband, was the murderer
of the King; that she ever was, and still continues de∣sirous,
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
that, if he be guilty, he may be brought to
condign punishment; that her resignation of the crown
was extorted from her by the well-grounded fears
of her life, and even by the direct menaces of vi∣olence;
and that Thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morton, the English ambas∣sador,
as well as others of her friends, had advised her
to sign that paper as the only means of saving herself
from the last extremity, and had assured her, that a
consent, given under these circumstances, could never
have any force or validity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p 60. &amp; seq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 162.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So far the Queen of Scots seemed plainly to have the
advantage in the contest; and the English commission∣ers
might have been surprized, that Murray had made
so weak a defence, and had suppressed all the material
imputations against that princess, on which his party
had ever so strenuously insisted, had not some private
conferences previously informed them of the secret.
Mary's commissioners had boasted, that Elizabeth,
from regard to her kinswoman, and from her desire
of maintaining the rights of sovereigns, was deter∣mined,
however criminal the couduct of, that princess
might appear, to restore her to the throne.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part. 2. p. 45. Goodall, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>; and
Murray, reflecting on some past measures of the En∣glish
court, began to apprehend that there were but too
just grounds for their expectations. He believed, that
Mary, if he would agree to conceal the most violent
part of the accusation against her, would submit to any
reasonable terms of accommodation; but if he once
proceeded so far as to charge her with the whole of her
guilt, no composition could afterwards take place;
and should she ever be restored, either by the power of
Elizabeth, or the assistance of her other friends, he and
his party must be exposed to her most severe and im∣placable
vengeance.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">An∣derson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 47, 48. Goodall, vol. II. p. 159.</NOTE> He resolved therefore not to
venture rashly on a measure, which it would be im∣possible
<PB N="141" REF="154"/>
for him ever to recal; and he paid privately a
visit to Norfolk and the other English commissioners,
confessed his scruples, laid before them the evidences
of the Queen's guilt, and desired to have some security
for Elizabeth's protection, in case these evidences
should, upon examination, appear entirely satisfactory.
Norfolk was not secretly displeased with these scruples
of the regent.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 92. Melvil, p. 94. 95. Haynes, p. 574.</NOTE>. He had ever been a partizan of the
Queen of Scots: Secretary Ledington, who began

address and capacity, had engaged him to embrace
farther views in her favour, and even to think of
espousing her: And tho' that duke confessed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol IV. part 2. p. 77.</NOTE>,
that the proofs against Mary seemed to him un∣questionable,
he encouraged Murray in his pre∣sent
resolution not to produce them publickly in the
conferences before the English commissioners.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 57, 77. State Trials, vol. I. p. 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>NORFOLK, however, was obliged to transmit to court
the queries proposed by the regent. These queries con∣sisted
of four particulars: Whether the English com∣missioners
had authority from their sovereign to pro∣nounce
any sentence against Mary, in case her guilt
should be fully proved before them? Whether they
would promise to exercise that authority, and pro∣ceed
to an actual sentence? Whether the Queen of
Scots, if she was found guilty, should be delivered into
the hands of the regent, or, at least, so secured in
England, that she never should be able to disturb the
tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth
would also, in that case, promise to acknowledge the
young King, and protect the regent in his autho∣rity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 55. Goodall, vol. II. p. 130.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when these queries, with the other
transactions, were laid before her, began to think that
<PB N="142" REF="155"/>
they pointed towards a conclusion more decisive and
more advantageous than she had hitherto expected.
She determined, therefore, to bring the matter into
full light: and under pretext that the distance from her
person retarded the proceedings of her commissioners,
she ordered them to come to London, and there con∣tinue
the conferences. On their appearance, she imme∣diately
joined in commission with them, some of the
most considerable of her council; Sir Nicholas Bacon
lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leicester, lord
Clinton, admiral, and Sir William Cecil, secretary<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 99.</NOTE>.
The Queen of Scots, who knew nothing of these secret
motives, and who expected, that fear or decency would
still restrain Murray from proceeding to any violent
accusation against her, expressed an entire satisfaction
in this adjournment, and declared, that the affair,
being under the immediated inspection of Elizabeth,
was now in the hands where she most desired it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95. Goodall, vol. II. p. 177, 179.</NOTE>. The
conferences were accordingly continued at Hampton-Court;
and Mary's commissioners, as before, made no
scruple to be present at them.</P>
<P>THE Queen, meanwhile, gave a satisfactory answer
to all Murray's demands; and having declared, that
tho' she wished and hoped, from the present enquiry,
to be entirely convinced of Mary's innocence, yet if
the event should prove contrary, and if that princess
should appear guilty of her husband's murder, she
should, for her part, deem her ever after unworthy of
a throne.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The regent, encouraged by this declara∣tion,
opened more fully his charge against the Queen
of Scots; and after expressing his reluctance to pro∣ceed
to that extremity, and protesting, that nothing
but the necessity of self-defence, which must not be
abandoned for any delicacy, could have engaged him in
such a measure, he proceeded to accuse her in plain
<PB N="143" REF="156"/>
terms of participation and consent in the assassination
of the King<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 115, &amp; seq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 206.</NOTE>. The earl of Lenox too appeared before
the English commissioners; and imploring vengeance
for the murder of his son, accused Mary as an ac∣compli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce
with Bothwel in that enormity.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 122. Goodal, vol. II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this charge was so unexpectedly given in,
and copies of it transmitted to the bishop of Ross, lord
Herreis, and the rest of Mary's commissioners, they
absolutely refused to return any answer; and they
grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons:
They had orders, they said, from their mistress, if any
thing was advanced that might touch her honour, not
to make any defence, as she was a sovereign princess,
and could not be subject to any tribunal; and they
required, that she should previously be admitted to Eli∣zabeth's
presence, to whom, and to whom alone, she
was determined to justify her innocence.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 125, &amp; seq. Goodal, vol. II. 184, 211, 217.</NOTE>. They for∣got,
that the conferences were at first begun, and were
still continued, with no other view than to clear her from
the accusations of her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever
pretended to enter into them only as her friend, by her
own consent and approbation, not as assuming any supe∣rior
jurisdiction over her; that that princess had from
the beginning refused to admit her to her presence, till
she should clear herself of the crimes imputed to her;
that she had therefore discovered no new signs of partia∣lity
by her perseverance in that resolution; and that tho'
she had granted an audience to the earl of Murray and
his collegues, she had previously conferred the same
honour on Mary's commissioners.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Lesley's Negociations in Anderson, vol. III. p. 25. Haynes, p. 487.</NOTE>; and her conduct was
so far entirely equal to both parties.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mary's complaints of the Queen's partiality in admitting Murray to a conference was a mere pretext in order to break off the conference. She indeed employs that reason in her commission for that purpose (see Good∣all, vol. II. p. 184) but in her private letter, they are directed to make use of that commission to prevent her honour from being attacked. Good-all, vol. II. p. 183. It was the accusation therefore she was only afraid of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="157"/>
As the Queen of Scots refused to give in any answer
to Murray's charge, the necessary consequence seemed
to be, that there could be no farther proceedings
in the trial. But tho' this silence might be inter∣preted
as a presumption against her, it did not fully
answer the purpose of those English ministers, who
were the enemies of that princess. They still desired
to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt; and
in order to draw them with decency from the regent,
a judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth. Mur∣ray
was called before the English commissioners; and
reproved by them, in the Queen's name, for the
atrocious imputations which he had the temerity to
throw upon his sovereign: But tho' the earl of Mur∣ray,
they added, and the other commissioners, had so
far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince, the
Queen never would overlook what she owed to her
friend, her neighbour, and her kinswoman; and
she therefore desired to know what they could say
in their own justification.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 147. Goodall, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE> Murray, thus urged,
made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his
charge against the Queen of Scots; and among the
rest, some love-letters and sonnets of her's to Bothwel,
wrote all in her own hand, and two other papers,
one wrote in her own hand, another signed by her,
and wrote by the earl of Huntley; each of which con∣tained
a promise of marriage with Bothwel, made
before the trial and acquital of that nobleman.</P>
<P>ALL these important papers had been kept by Both∣wel
in a silver box or casket, which had been given
him by Mary, and which had belonged to her first hus∣band
Francis; and tho' the princess had enjoined him to
<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
burn the letters as soon as he had read them, he had
thought proper to preserve them carefully, as
pledges of her fidelity, and had committed them to
the custody of Sir James Balfour, deputy-governor
of the castle of Edinburgh. When that fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess was
besieged by the associated lords, Bothwel sent a ser∣vant
to receive the casket from the hands of the depu∣ty-governor.
Balfour delivered it to the messenger;
but as he had at that time received some disgust
from Bothwel, and was secretly negociating an agree∣ment
with the ruling party, he took care, by convey∣ing
private intelligence to the earl of Morton, to
make the papers be intercepted by him. They con∣tained
incontestible proofs of Mary's criminal cor∣respondence
with Bothwel, of her consent to the
King's murder, and of her concurrence in that rape
which Bothwel pretended to commit upon her.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 115. Goodall vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE>
Murray fortified this evidence by some testimonies of
correspondent facts,<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. part 2. p. 165, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 243.</NOTE>; and he added, sometime af∣ter,
the dying confession of one Hubert, or French
Paris, as he was called, a servant of Bothwel's, who
had been executed for the King's murder, and who
directly charged the Queen with her being accessary
to that criminal enterprize.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. p. 192. Goodall, vol. II. p. 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY's commissioners had used every expedient
to ward this blow, which they saw coming upon
them, and against which, it appears, they were not
provided of any proper defence. As soon as Murray
opened his charge, they endeavoured to turn the con∣ferences
from an enquiry into a negociation; and tho'
informed by the English commissioners, that nothing
could be more dishonourable for their mistress, than
to enter into a treaty with such undutiful subjects,
before she had justified herself from those enormous
<PB N="146" REF="159"/>
imputations which had been thrown upon her, they
still insisted, that Elizabeth should settle terms of ac∣commodation
between Mary and her enemies in Scot∣land.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. II. part 2. p. 135, 139, Goodall, vol. II. p. 224.</NOTE>. They maintained, that till their mistress
had given in her answer to Murray's charge, his
proofs could neither be called for nor produced.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 139, 145. Goodall, vol. II. p. 228.</NOTE>;
and finding, that the English commissioners were still
determined to proceed in the method which had been
projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and
never would make any reply. These papers have
all of them been since published. The objections
made to their authenticity, are in general of small
force: But were they ever so specious, they cannot
now be hearkened to; since Mary, at the time when
the truth could have been fully cleared, did, in effect,
ratify the evidence against her, by recoiling from the
enquiry at the very critical moment, and refusing to
give any answer to the accusation of her enemies.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>We shall not enter into a long discussion of the authenticity of these letters: We shall only remark in general, that the chief objections against them are, that they are supposed to have passed through the earl of Mor∣ton's hands, the least scrupulous of all Mary's enemies; and that they are, to the last degree, indecent, and even somewhat inelegant, such as it is not likely she would write. But to these presumptions we may oppose the fol∣lowing considerations. (1.) Though it be not difficult to counterfeit a sub∣scription, it is very difficult, and almost impossible, to counterfeit several pages, so as to resemble exactly the hand writing of any person. These let∣ters were examined and compared with Mary's h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd writing, by the English privvy council, and by a great many of the nobility, among whom were seve∣ral patizans of that princess. They might have been examined by the bishop of Ross, Herreis, and Mary's commissioners. The regent must have expect∣ed, that they would be very critically examined by them: and had they not been able to stand that test, he was only preparing a scene of confusion to himself. Bishop Lesly expressly declines the comparing the hands, which he calls no legal proof▪ Goodall, vol. II. p. 389. (2) The letters are very long, much longer than they needed to have been, in order to serve the pur∣poses of Mary's enemies; a circumstance, which increased the difficulty, and exposed any forgery the more to the risk of a detection. (3.) They are not so gross and palpable, as forgeries commonly are; for they left still a pretext for Mary's friends to assert, that their meaning was strained to make them appear criminal; see Goodall, vol. II. p. 361. (4.) There is a long contract of marriage, said to be wrote by the earl of Huntley, and signed by the Queen, before Bothwell's acquital. Would Morton, without any ne∣cessity, have thus doubled the difficulties of the forgery; and the danger of detection? (5.) The letters are indiscreet; but such was apparently Ma∣ry's conduct at that time: They are inelegant; but they have a careless, natural air, like letters hastily wrote between familiar friends. (6.) They contain such a variety of particular circumstances, as no body could have thought of inventing, especially as they must necessarily have afforded her many means of detection. (7.) We have not the originals of the letters, which were in French: We have only a Scots and Latin translation from the original, and a French translation professedly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable, that the Scots translation is full of Gallicisms, and is clearly a translation from a French original: Such as <HI>make fault, faire des fautes; make it seem that I believe. faire semblant de le croire; make brek, faire breche; this is my first journay, cêstma premiere journ éc; have you not desire to laugh, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> avez vous pas envie de rire; the place will hald unto the death, la place tiendra jusqu'a la mort; he may not come forth of the house this long time, il ne peut pas sortir du logis de long tems; to make me adver∣tisement, faire m'avertir; put order to it, mettre ordre a cela; discharg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your heart; decharger votre coeur; make gud watch, faites bon garde,</HI> &amp;c. (8.) There is a conversation, which she mentions, between herself and the King one evening: but Murray produced before the English commissio∣ners, the testimony of one Crawfor, a gentleman of the carl of Lenox, who swore, that the King, on her departure from him, gave him an ac∣count of the same conversation. (9.) There seems very little reason why Murray and his associates should run the risk of such a dangerous forge∣ry, which must have rendered them infamous, if detected; since their cause, from Mary's known conduct, even without these letters, was suf∣ficiently good and justifiable. (10.) Murray exposed these letters to the examination of persons qualified to judge of them; the Scots council, the Scots Parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her council, who were possess∣ed of a great number of Mary's genuine letters. (11.) He gave Mary herself an opportunity of refuting and exposing him, if she had chosen to lay hold of it. (12.) The letters tally so well with all the other parts of her conduct during that transaction, that these proofs throw the strong∣est light on each other. (13.) The duke of Norfolk, who had examined these papers, and who favoured so much Queen Mary, that he intended to marry her, and in the end lost his life in her cause, yet believed them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This appears not only from his letters above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth and her ministers, but by his secret acknowledgment to Banister, his most trusty confident. See State Trials, vol. I. p. 81. In the conferences between the duke, se∣cretary Lidington, and the bishop of Ross, all of them zealous partizans of that princess, the same thing seems always to be taken for granted, Ibid. p. 74, 75. See farther MS. in the Advocate's library. A. 3. 28. p. 314. from Cott, lib. Calig. c. 9. (14.) I need not repeat the pre∣fumption drawn from Mary's resusal to answer. The only excuse for her silence, is, that she suspected Elizabeth to be a partial judge: It was not, indeed, the interest of that princess to acquit and justify her rival and com∣petitor; and we accordingly find that Lidington, from the secret informa∣tion of the duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the bishop of Ross, that the Queen of England never meant to come to a decision; but only to get into her hands the proofs of Mary's guilt, in order to blast her character: See State Trials, vol 1. p. 77. But this was a better reason for declin∣ing the trial altogether than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, the very moment the chief accusation was unexpectedly opened against her. Tho' she could not expect Elizabeth's final decision in her favour, it was of importance to give a satisfactory answer, if she had any, to the accusa∣tion of the Scots commissioners. That answer could have been disperst for the conviction of the public, of foreign nations, and of posterity. And surely after the accusation and proofs were in Queen Elizabeth's hands, it could do no hurt to give in the answers. Mary's information, that the Queen never intended to come to a decision, could be no obstacle to her justification. (15.) The very disappearance of these letters, is a presump∣tion of their authenticity. That event can be accounted for no way but from the care of King James's friends, who were desirous to destroy every proof of his mother's crimes. The disappearance of Morton's narrative, and of Crawford's evidence, from the Cotton library, Calig. c. 1. must have proceeded from a like cause. See MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 29. p. 88.</P>
<P>I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters, drawn from the vote of the Scots privy council, which affirms the letters to be wrote and subscribed by Queen Mary's own hand; whereas the copies given in to the Parliament a few days after, were only wrote, not subscribed. See Goodall, vol. 11. p. 64, 67. But it is not considered, that this circum∣stance is of no manner of force: There were certainly letters, true or false, laid before the council; and whether the letters were true or false, this mistake procceds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk. The mistake is easily accounted for: The letters were only wrote by her; the second contract with Bothwel was only subscribed. A proper accurate distinction was not made; and they are all said to be wrote and subscribed. A late writer, Mr. Goodall, has endeavoured to prove, that these letters clash with chronology, and that the Queen was not in the places mentioned in the letters, on the days there assigned: To confirm this, he produces charters and other deeds signed by the Queen, where the date and place do not agree with the letters. But it is well known, that the date of charters, and such like grants, is no proof of the real day on which they were signed by the sovereign. Papers of that kind commonly pass through different offices: The date is affixed by the first office; and may precede very long the day of the signature.</P>
<P>The account given by Morton of the manner in which the papers came into his hands, is very natural. When he gave it to the English commission∣ers, he had reason to think it would be canvassed with all the severity of able adversaries, interested in the highest degree to refute it. It is proba∣ble, that he could have confirmed it by many circumstances and testimo∣nies; since they declined the contest.</P>
<P>The sonnets are inelegant; insomuch, that both Brantome and Ron∣fard, who knew Queen Mary's stile, were assured, when they saw them, that they could not be her composition. Jebb, vol. II. p. 478. But noperson is equal in his productions, especially one whose style is so little formed as Mary's must be supposed to be. Not to mention, that such dangerous and criminal enterprizes leave little tranquillity of mind for ele∣gant, poetical compositions.</P>
<P>In a word, Queen Mary might easily have conducted the whole conspi∣racy against her husband, without opening her mind to any one person except Bothwel, and without writing a scrap of paper about it; but it was very difficult to have conducted it, so as that her conduct should not be∣tray her to men of discernment. In the present case, her conduct was so gross as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to betray her to every body; and fortune threw into her ene∣mies hands, papers by which they could convict her. The same infatua∣tion and imprudence, which happily is the usual attendant of great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imes, will account for both. It is proper to observe, that there is not one circumstance of the foregoing narrative, contained in the history, that is taken from Knox, Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> anan, or even Thuanus, or, indeed, from any suspected authority.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="160"/>
BUT Elizabeth, though she had seen enough for
her own satisfaction, was determined, that the most
<PB N="148" REF="161"/>
eminent persons of her court should also be acquaint∣ed
with these transactions, and should be convinced
<PB N="149" REF="162"/>
of the equity of her proceedings. She ordered her
privy-council to be assembled; and that she might ren∣der
the matter more solemn and authentic, she added
to them the earls of Northumberland, Westmoreland,
Shrewsbury, Worester, Huntingdon, and Warwic.
All the proceedings of the English commissioners were
read to them: The evidences produced by Murray
were perused: A great number of letters, wrote by
Mary to Elizabeth, were laid before them, and the
hand-writing compared with that of the letters deliver∣ed
in by the regent: The refusal of the Queen of
Scots commissioners to make any reply, was related:
<PB N="150" REF="163"/>
And on the whole Elizabeth told them, that as she had,
at first, thought it improper, that Mary, after such
horrid crimes were imputed to her, should be admit∣ted
to her presence, before she had, in some measure,
justified herself from the charge; so now, when her
guilt was confirmed by so many plausible evidences,
and all answer refused, she must, for her part, perse∣vere
more steadily in that resolution<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 170, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 254.</NOTE> Elizabeth next
called in the Queen of Scots commissioners, and after
observing, that she deemed it much more decent for
their mistress to continue the conferences, than to
require the liberty of justifying herself in person;
she told them, that Mary might either send her re∣ply
by a person whom she trusted, or deliver it
herself to some English noblemen, whom Elizabeth
should appoint to wait upon her: But as to her re∣solution
of making no reply at all, she must regard it
as the strongest confession of guilt; nor could they
ever be esteemed her friends, who advised her to that method of proceeding<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 179, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 268.</NOTE> These topics she enforced
still more strongly in a letter which she wrote to
Mary herself<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 183. Goodall, vol. II. p. 269.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots had no other subterfuge from
these pressing remonstrances than still to demand a
personal conference with Elizabeth: A concession
which, she was sensible, could never be granted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 157.</NOTE>; both
because Elizabeth knew, that that expedient could de∣cide
nothing, and because it brought matters to ex∣tremity,
which that princess desired to avoid. In or∣der
to keep herself better in countenance, Mary thought
of another device. Even after all the conferences
were broke off, she ordered her commissioners to ac∣cuse
the earl of Murray and his associates as the mur∣derers
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
of the King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE> But this accusation coming so
late, being extorted merely by a complaint of Mur∣ray's,
and being unsupported by any proof, could on∣ly
be regarded as an angry retaliation upon her ene∣my<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Unless we take this angry accusation, advanced by Queen Mary, to be an argument of Murray's guilt, there remains not the least presump∣tion which should le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us to suspect him to have been any wise an ac∣complice in the King's murder. That Queen neyer pretended to give any proof of the charge; and her commissioners affirmed at the time, that they themselves knew of none, tho' they were ready to maintain its truth by their mistress's orders, and would produce such proof as she should send them. It is remarkable, that▪ at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to produce any proof; because the conferences before the En∣glish commissioners were previously broke off.</P>
<P>It is true, the bishop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet, wrote by him un∣der a borrowed name, (where it is easy to say any thing) affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Murray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table▪ That nobleman, as Lesly relates the matter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commission of that crime, said to him among other talk, <HI>This night 'ere morning the lord Darnley shall lose his life.</HI> See Anderson, vol. 1. p. 75. But this is only hearsay of Lesly's, con∣cerning a hearsay of Herreis's; and contains a very improbable fact. Would Murray, without any use or necessity, communicate to a servant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of conversation? We may also observe, that lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. Had he ever heard this story, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.</P>
<P>The earls of Huntley and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but the reason which they assign is most ridiculous. He had given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore he was the King's murderer. See Anderson, vol. IV. part 2. p. 192. It is a sure argu∣ment, that these earls knew no better proof against Murray, otherwise they would have produced it, and not have insisted on so absurd a pre∣sumption. Was not this also the time for Huntley to deny his writing Mary's contract with Bothwel, if that paper had been a forgery?</P>
<P>Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King, in∣deed, bore him some ill-will; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the King himself was become so de∣spicable, both from his own ill-conduct and the Queen's aversion to him, that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To judge by the event, in any case, is always absurd; but more especially in the present.</P>
<P>The King's murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency: But much more Queen Mary's ill-conduct and imprudence, which he could not possibly foresee, and which never would have happened, had she been en∣tirely innocent.</P></NOTE> She also desired to have copies of the papers giv∣en
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
in by the regent; but as she still persisted in her
resolution to make no reply, this demand was finally
refused her<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 253, 283, 289, 310, 311. Haynes, vol. I. p. 492.</NOTE></P>
<P>As Mary had thus put an end to the conference,
the regent expressed great impatience to return into
Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had
taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the
whole government into confusion. Elizabeth, there∣fore,
dismissed him; and granted him a loan of five
thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 677.</NOTE>.
During the conference at York, the duke of Chatel∣rault
arrived at London, in passing from France;
and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Ma∣ry's
party, and had very plusible pretensions to the
regency of the King of Scots; she thought proper to de∣tain
him till after Murray's departure. But not∣withstanding
these marks of favour, and some other
assistance, which she secretly gave the regent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's libra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. A 3, 29. p. 128. 129, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>30, from Cott. Lib. Cal. c. 1.</NOTE>, she
still declined acknowledging the young King, or treat∣ing
with Murray as regent of Scotland.</P>
<P>ORDERS were given for removing the Queen of
Scots from Bolton, a place surrounded with catholics,
to Tutbury in the county of Stafford; where she was
put under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury. Eli∣zabeth
entertained hopes, that that princess, discou∣raged
by her misfortunes, and confounded by the
late transactions, would be glad to secure a safe
retreat from all the tempests, with which she
had been agitated; and she promised to bury every
thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agrees, ei∣ther
to resign voluntarily her crown, or to associate
<PB N="153" REF="166"/>
her son with her in the government; and the ad∣ministration
to remain, during his minority, in the
hands of the earl of Murray<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE> But that high-spi∣rited
princess refused all treaty upon such terms, and
declared that her last words should be those of a Queen
of Scotland. Besides many other reasons, she said,
which fixed her in that resolution, she knew, that, if,
in the present emergence, she made such concessions,
her submission would be universally deemed an acknow∣legement
of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of
her enemies<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 301.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY still insisted upon the alternative of two de∣mands;
either that Elizabeth should assist her in re∣covering
her authority, or should give her liberty to
retire into France, and make trial of the friendship of
other princes: And as she asserted, that she had
come voluntarily into England, invited by many for∣mer
professions of amity, she thought that one of
these requests could not, without the most extreme
injustice, be refused her. But Elizabeth, sensible of
the danger, which attended either of these proposals,
was secretly resolved to detain her still a captive; and
as her retreat into England had been very little volun∣tary,
her claim upon the Queen's generosity appeared
much less urgent than she was willing to pretend. Ne∣cessity,
it was thought, would to the prudent justify
her detention: Her past misconduct would apologize
for it to the equitable: And tho' it was foreseen, that
compassion for her situation, joined to her intrigues and
insinuating behaviour, would, while she remained in
England, excite the zeal of her friends, especially of
the catholics; these inconveniences were esteemed
much less than those which attended any other expe∣dient.
Elizabeth trusted also to her own address, for
eluding all those difficulties: She proposed to avoid
breaking absolutely with the Queen of Scots, to keep
<PB N="154" REF="167"/>
her always in hopes of accommodation, to negotiate
perpetually with her, and still to throw the blame of
not coming to any conclusion, either on unforeseen
accidents, or on the obstinacy and perverseness of
others.</P>
<P>WE come now to mention some English affairs,
which we left behind us, that we might not interrupt
our narration of the events in Scotland, which form
so material a part of the present reign. The term,
fixed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis for the resti∣tution
of Calais expired in 1567; and Elizabeth, af∣ter
making her demand at the gates of that city, sent
Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that minister, in
conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her ordinary am∣bassador,
enforced her pretensions. Conferences were
held on that head, without coming to any conclusion.
The chancellor De L'Hopital told the English am∣bassadors,
that tho' France by an article of the treaty
was obliged to restore Calais on the expiration of
eight years, there was another article of the same trea∣ty,
which now deprived Elizabeth of all right, that
could accrue to her by that engagement: That it was
agreed, if the English should, during that interval,
commit hostilities upon France, they should instantly
forfeit all claim to Calais; and the taking possession
of Havre and Dieppe, with whatever pretences that
measure might be covered, was a plain violation of
the peace between the nations: That tho' these places
were not taken by force, but put into Elizabeth's
hands by the governors; these governors were rebels;
and a correspondence with such offenders was the most
flagrant injury, which could be committed to any so∣vereign:
That in the treaty, which ensued upon the
expulsion of the English from Normandy, the French
ministers had absolutely refused to make any mention
of Calais, and had thereby declared their intention to
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
take advantage of the title which had accrued ro the
crown of France: And that tho' a general clause had
been inserted, implying a reservation of all claims;
this concession could not avail the English, who at
that time possessed no just claim to Calais, and had
previously forfeited all pretensions to that fortress<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 587.</NOTE>
The Queen was no wise surprized at hearing these
allegations; and as she knew, that the French court
intended not from the first to make restitution, much
less, after they could defend their refusal by such plau∣sible
reasons, she thought it better for the present to
submit to the loss, than to pursue a doubtful title by
a war both dangerous and expensive, as well as un∣seasonable<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 406.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH entered anew into negotiations for
marrying the archduke Charles; and she seemed at
present to have no great motive of policy, which might
induce her to make this fallacious offer: But as she
was very rigorous in the terms insisted on, and refused
him all power and title, and even the exercise of his
religion in England, the treaty came to nothing; and
that prince, despairing of success in his addresses,
married the daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 407, 408.</NOTE>.

yoke of the papal authority, no one proceeded
with so much reason and moderation as the church of
England; and advantage, which had been derived partly
from the interposition of the civil magistrate in this in∣novation,
partly from the gradual and slow steps by
which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom.
Rage and animosity against the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atholic religion was
as little indulged as could be supposed in such a revolu∣tion:
The fabric of the secular hierachy was maintain∣ed
entire: The antient liturgy was preserved, so far
as was thought consistent with the new principles:
Many ceremonies, become venerable from age and pre∣ceding
use, were retained: The splendor of the catholic
worship, tho' removed, had at least given place to
order and decency: The distinctive habits of the clergy,
according to their different ranks, were continued:
No innovation was admitted merely from spite and op∣position
to the former usage: And the new religion,
by mitigating the genius of the antient superstition,
and rendering it more compatible with the peace and
interests of society, had preserved itself in that happy
medium, which wise men have always sought, and
<PB N="157" REF="172"/>
which the people have so seldom been able to main∣tain.</P>
<P>BUT tho' such in general was the spirit of the re∣formation
in that country, many of the English re∣formers,
being men of a more warm complexion and
more obstinate temper, endeavoured to push matters to
extremity against the church of Rome, and indulged
themselves in the most violent contrariety and antipa∣thy
to all former practices. Among these, Hooper,
who afterwards suffered for his religion with such ex∣traordinary
conftancy, was chiefly distinguished. This
man was appointed, during the reign of Edward, to the
see of Glocester, and made no scruple of accepting the
episcopal office; but he refused to be consecrated in the
episcopal habits, the cymarre and rochette, which had
formerly, he said, been abused to superstition, and
which were thereby rendered unbecoming a true chris∣tian.
Cranmer and Ridley were surprized at this ob∣jection,
which opposed the received practice, and even
the established laws; and tho' young Edward, desirous
to promote a man so celebrated for his eloquence, his
zeal, and his morals, enjoined them to dispense with
this ceremony, they still continued resolute to retain
it. Hooper then embraced the resolution, rather to re∣fuse
the bishopric than cloath himself in those hated
garments; but it was determined, that, for the sake
of the example, he should not escape of easily. He was
first consined to Cranmer's house, and then thrown
into prison, till he should consent to be a bishop on the
terms proposed: He was plyed with conferences, and
reprimands, and arguments: Bucer and Peter Martyr
and the most celebrated foreign reformers were consult∣ed
on this important question: And a compromise,
with great difficulty, was at last made, that Hooper
should not be obliged to wear commonly the obnoxious
robes, but should agree to be consecrated in them, and
to use them during cathedral service<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 152. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, p. 90.</NOTE>: A condescension
<PB N="158" REF="173"/>
not a little extraordinary in a man of so inflexible, a spirit
as this reformer.</P>
<P>THE same objection, which had risen with regard to
the episcopal habits, had been moved against the ray∣ment
of the inferior clergy; and the surplice in particu∣lar,
with the tippet and corner cap, was a great object
of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 416.</NOTE> In vain
was it urged, that particular habits, as well as postures
and ceremonies, being constantly used by the clergy,
and employed in religious service, acquire a veneration
in the eyes of the people, appear sacred to their appre∣hensions,
exite their devotion, and contract a kind of
mysterious virtue, which attaches the affections of men
to the national and established worship: That in order
to produce this effect an uniformity in these particulars
is requisite, and even a perseverance, as far as possible
in the former practice: And that the nation would be
happy, if, by retaining these inoffensive observances,
they could engage the people to renounce willingly what
was hurtful or pernicious in the antient superstition
These arguments, which had influence with wise men,
were the very reasons, which engaged the violent pro∣testants
to reject the habits. They pushed matters to
a total opposition with the church of Rome: Every
compliance, they said, was a symbolizing with An∣tichrist<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 416.</NOTE>: And this spirit was carried so far by some re∣formers,
that in a national remonstrance; which was
afterwards made by the church of Scotland against these
habits, it was asked, “What has Christ Jesus to do
with Belial? What has darkness to do with light?
If surplices, corner caps, and tippets have been
badges of idolaters in the very act of their idolatry;
why should the preacher of Christian liberty, and
the open rebuker of all superstition partake with the
dregs of the Romish beast? Yea, who is there that
ought not rather to be afraid of taking in his hand or
on his forehead the print and mark of that odious
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
beast<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 565. Knox. p. 402.</NOTE>?” But this application was rejected by the
English church.</P>
<P>THERE was only one instance, where the spirit of
contradiction to the Romanists took place universally in
England: The altar was removed from the wall, was
placed in the middle of the church, and was thence∣forth
denominated the communion-table. The reason,
why this reformation met with such general compliance,
was, that the nobility and gentry got thereby a pre∣tence
for making spoil of the plate, vestures, and
rich ornaments, which belonged to the altars<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, preface, p. 3. Hist. p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE disputes, which had been started during the
reign of Edward, were carried abroad by the protestants,
who fled from the persecutions of Mary; and as their
zeal had received an encrease from the furious cruelty
of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry
their opposition to the utmost extremity against the
practices of the church of Rome. Their communi∣cation
with Calvin and the other reformers, who fol∣lowed
the discipline and worship of Geneva, confirmed
them farther in this obstinate reluctance; and tho' some
of the refugees, particularly those established at Frank∣fort,
still adhered to King Edward's liturgy, the pre∣vailing
spirit carried these confessors to seek a still farther
reformation. On the accession of Elizabeth, they
returned to their native country; and being regarded
with general veneration on account of their zeal and
past sufferings, they ventured to insist on the establish∣ment
of their projected model; nor did they want coun∣tenance
from many considerable persons in the Queen's
council. But the Princess herself, so far from being
willing to despoil religion of the few ornaments and
ceremonies, which remained in it, was of herself rather
inclined to bring the public worship still nearer to the
Romish ritual<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">When Nowel, one of her chaplains, had spoke less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmon, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before her of the sign of the cross, she called a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to him from her closet window, commanding him to retire from that ungodly digression and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> return unto his text.

<PB N="159" REF="176"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="160" REF="177"/>
had already gone too far in shaking off those forms and
observances, which, without distracting men of more
refined apprehensions, tend in a very innocent manner
to allure, and amuse, and engage the vulgar. She
took care to have a law for uniformity strictly enacted:
She was empowered by the parliament to add any new
ceremonies, which she thought proper: And tho' she
was sparing in the exercise of this prerogative, she
continued rigid in exacting an observance of the estab∣lished
laws, and in punishing all nonconformity. The
zealots, therefore, who harboured a secret antipathy to
the episcopal order and to the whole liturgy, were oblig∣ed,
in a great measure, to conceal these sentiments,
which would have been regarded as highly audacious
and criminal; and they confined their avowed objecti∣ons
to the surplice, the confirmation of children, the
sign of the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, kneel∣ing
at the sacramet, and bowing at the name of Jesus.
So fruitless is it for sovereigns to watch with a rigid care
over orthodoxy, and to employ the sword in religious
controversy, that the work, perpetually renewed, is
perpetually to beigin; and a garb, a gesture, nay, a
metaphysical or grammatical distinction, when rendered
important by the disputes of theologians and the zeal of
the magistrate, is sufficient to destroy the unity of the
church, and even the peace of society. These contro∣versies
had already excited such ferment among the
people, that in some places they refused to frequent the
churches where the habits and ceremonies were used,
would not salute the conforming clergy, and proceeded
so far as to revile them in the streets, so spit in their
<PB N="161" REF="178"/>
faces, and to use them with all manner of contumely<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, p. 460.</NOTE>.
And while the sovereign authority checked these ex∣cesses,
the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me was confined, not extinguished; and
burning fiercer from confinement, it burst out in the
succeeding reigns to the destruction of the church and
monarchy.</P>
<P>ALL enthusiasts, indulging themselves in rapturous
flights, extasies, visions, inspirations, have a natural
aversion to episcopal authority, to ceremonies, rites,
and forms, which they denominate supersti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, or beg∣garly
elements, and which seem to restrain the liberal
effusions of their zeal and devotion: But there was
another set of opinions adopted by these innovators,
which rendered them in a peculiar manner the object
of Elizabeth's aversion. The same bold and daring
spirit, which accompanied them in their addresses to the
divinity, appeared in their political speculations; and
the principles of civil liberty, which, during some
reigns, had been very little avowed in the nation, and
which were totally incompatible with the present ex∣orbitant
prerogative, had been strongly adopted by this
new sect. Scarce any sovereign before Elizabeth, and
none after her, carried higher, both in speculation and
practice, the authority of the crown; and the puritans
(<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o these sectaries were called, on account of their pre∣tending
to a greater purity of worship and discipline)
could not recommend themselves worse to her favour,
than by preaching up the doctrine of resisting or re∣straining
princes. From all these motives, the Queen
neglected no opportunity of depressing those zealous
inn vators; and while they were coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nanced by
some of her most favour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ministers, Cecil, Leicester,
Knolles, Bedford, Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>singham, she never was, to
the end of her life, reconciled to their principles and
practices.</P>
<P>WE have thought proper to insert in this place an
<PB N="162" REF="179"/>
account of the rise and the genius of the puritans;
because Camden marks the present years, as the period
when they began to make themselves considerable in
England. We now return to our narration.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Norsolk was the only peer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1569. Duke of Norfolk's conspiracy.</NOTE> who
enjoyed the highest title of nobility; and as there were
at present no princes of the blood, the splendor of his
family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of
his influence, had rendered him without comparison
the first subject in England. The qualities of his mind
corresponded to his high station: Beneficent, affable,
generous, he had acquired the affections of the people;
prudent, moderate, obsequious, he possessed without
givning jealousy the good graces of his sovereign. His
grandfather and father had long been regarded as the
leaders of the catholics; and this hereditary attach∣ment,
joined to the alliances of blood, had procured
him the friendship of the most considerable men of that
party: But as he had been educated among the refor∣mers,
was sincerely devoted to their principles, and
maintained that strict decorum and regularity of life,
by which the protestants were at that time distinguish∣ed;
he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being po∣pular
even with the most opposite factions. The height
of his prosperity alone was the source of his misfortunes,
and engaged him into attempts, from which his virtue
and prudence would naturally have for ever kept him
at a distance.</P>
<P>NORFOLK was at this time a windower; and being
of a suitable age to espouse the Queen of Scots, that
marriage had appeared so natural, that it had occurred
to several of his friends and those of that princess: But
the first person, who, after secretary Lidington, opened
the scheme to the duke is said to be the earl of Murray,
before his departure for Scotland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 36, 37.</NOTE> That nobleman
set before Norfolk both the advantage of composing the
differences in Scotland by an alliance which would be
<PB N="163" REF="180"/>
so generally accceptable, and the prospect of reaping the
succession of England; and in order to bind Norfolk's
interest the faster with Mary's, he proposed that the
duke's daughter should espouse the young king of Scot∣land.
The obtaining previously Elizabeth's consent,
was regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a circum∣stance
essential to the success of their project; and
all circumstances being adjusted between them, Murray
took care, by the means of Sir Rober Melvil, to have
the design communicated to the Queen of Scots.
That princess replied, that the vexations, which she
had met with in her two last marriages, had made her
more inclined to lead a single life, but she was deter∣mined
to sacifice her own inclinations to the public
welfare: And therefore, so soon as she should be le∣gally
divorced from Bothwell, she would be determin∣ed
by the opinoin of her nobility and people in the
choice of another husband<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 40, 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is probable, that Murray was not sincere in this
proposal. He had two motives to engage him to dis∣simulation.
He knew the danger, which he must
run in his return thro' the North of England, from the
power of the Earls of Northumberland and Westmore∣land,
Mary's partizans in that country; and he dread∣ed
an insurrection in Scotland from the duke of Chat∣elrault,
and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom
she had appointed her lieutenants during her absence.
By these feigned appearances of friendship, he both en∣gaged
Norfolk to write in his favour to the northern
nobleman<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 76, 78.</NOTE> and he persuaded the Queen of Scots to
give her lieutenants permission, and even advice, to make
a cessation of hostilities with the regent's party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, tho' he had agreed, that Eli∣zabeth's
consent should be previously obtained, before
the completion of his marriage, had good reason to ap∣prehend,
that he never should prevail with her volun∣tarily
<PB N="164" REF="181"/>
to make that concession. He knew her perpetual
and unrelenting jealousy against her heir and rival; he
was acquainted with her former reluctance to all pro∣posals
of marriage with the Queen of Scots; he foresaw,
that that princess's espousing a person of his power, and
character, and interest, would give the greatest um∣brage;
and as it would then become necessary to re∣instate
Mary in possession of her throne on some tole∣rable
terms, and even to endeavour the re-establishing
her character, he dreaded, that Elizabeth, whose po∣litics
had now taken a different turn, would never agree
to such indulgent and generous conditions. He there∣fore
attempted previously to gain the consent and ap∣probation
of several of the most considerable nobility;
and he was successful with the earls of Pembroke,
Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrewsbury, Southampton,
Northumberland, Westmoreland, Sussex<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 55. Camden, p. 419. Spotswood, p. 230.</NOTE>. The lord
Lumley, and Sir Nicholas Throcmorton embraced
cordially the proposal: Even the earl of Leicester, Eli∣zabeth's
declared favourite, who had formerly enter∣tained
some views of espousing Mary, willingly re∣signed
all his pretensions, and seemed to enter zea∣lously
into Norfolk's interests<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 535.</NOTE>. There were other
motives, besides affection to the duke, which produced
this general combination of the nobility.</P>
<P>SIR William Cecil, secretary of state, was the most
vigilant, active, and prudent minister ever known in
England; and as he was governed by no views but
the interests of his sovereign, which he inflexibly pur∣sued,
his authority over her became every day more pre∣dominant.
Ever cool himself, and uninfluenced by
prejudice or affection, he checked those sallies of passion,
and sometimes of caprice, to which she was subject;
and if he failed of perswading her in the first movement,
his perseverance, and remonstrances, and arguments
were sure at last to recommend themselves to her sound
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
discernment. The more credit he gained with his
mistress, the more was he exposed to the envy of her
other counsellors; and as he had been supposed to adopt
the interests of the house of Suffolk, whose claim seem∣ed
to carry with it no danger to the present establish∣ment,
his enemies, in opposition to him, were natu∣rally
led to attach themselves to the Queen of Scots.
Elizabeth saw, without uneasiness, this emulation
among her courtiers, which served to augment her
authority: and tho she supported Cecil, wherever
matters came to extremity, and dissipated every con∣spiracy
against him, particularly one laid about this
time to have him thrown into the Tower on some pre∣tence
or other<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 417.</NOTE>, she never gave him such unlimited
confidence as might enable him entirely to crush his
adversaries.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, sensible of the difficulty, which he must
meet with in controling Cecil's councils, especially
where they concurred with the inclinations, as well as
interests of the Queen, durst not open to her his inten∣tions
of marrying the Queen of Scots; but proceeded
still in the same course of encreasing his interest in the
kingdom, and engaging more of the nobility to take
part in his measures. A letter was wrote to Mary
by Leicester, and signed by several men of the first
rank, recommending Norfolk for her husband, and
stipulating conditions for the advantage of both king∣doms;
particularly, that she should give sufficient surety
to Elizabeth, and the heirs of her body, for the free
enjoyment of the crown of England; that a perpetual
league, offensive and defensive, be made between their
realms and subjects; that the protestant religion be
established by law in Scotland; and that she should
grant an amnesty to her rebels in that kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 50. Camden, p. 420. Haynes, p. 535, 539.</NOTE>. When
Mary returned a favourable answer to this application,
Norfolk employed himself with new ardor in the exe∣cution
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>
of his project; and besides securing the interests
of many of the considerable gentry and nobility who
resided at court, he wrote letters to such as lived at their
country seats, and possessed the greatest authority in the
several counties<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 62.</NOTE> The Kings of France and Spain,
who interested themselves extremely in Mary's cause,
were secretly consulted, and expressed their approbation
of these measures<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 63.</NOTE> And tho' Elizabeth's consent was
always supposed as a previous condition to the finishing
this alliance, it was apparently Norfolk's intention, when
he proceeded such lengths without consulting her, to
render his party so strong, that it should no longer be in
her power to refuse it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was impossible, that so extensive a conspiracy
could entirely escape the Queen's vigilance and that
of Cecil. She dropt several surmises to the duke,
by which he might learn, that she was acquainted
with his designs; and she frequently warned him to
beware on what pillow he reposed his head<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420 Spotswood, p. 231.</NOTE>. But he
never had the prudence or the courage to open to her
his full intentions. Certain intelligence of this dange∣rous
combination was given her first by Leicester,
then by Murray<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 7. It appears by Haynes, p. 521, 525, that Queen Eliza∣beth had heard rumours of Norfolk's dealing with Murray; and charged the latter to inform her of the whole truth, which he accordingly did. See al∣so the earl of Murray's letter produced on Norfolk's trial.</NOTE>, who, if ever he was sincere in pro∣moting
Norfolk's marriage, which is much to be sus∣pected,
had at least proposed, for his own safety and
that of his party, that Elizabeth should, in reality as
well as in appearance, be entire arbiter of the con∣ditions,
and should not have her consent extorted
by any confederacy of her own subjects. This infor∣mation
gave great alarm to the court of England; and
the more so, as those intrigues were attended with
<PB N="167" REF="184"/>
other circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1569</NOTE> of which, it is probable, Eliza∣beth
was not wholly ignorant.</P>
<P>AMONG the nobility and gentry, that seemed to en∣ter
into Norfolk's views, there were many, who were
zealously attached to the catholic religion, who had
no other design than that of restoring Mary to her li∣berty,
and who would gladly, by a combination with
foreign powers, or even at the expence of a civil war,
have placed her on the throne of England. The earls
of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who possessed
great power in the north, were leaders of this party:
and the former nobleman made offer to the Queen of
Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to lord Dacres,
that he would free her from confinement, and convey
her to Scotland or any other place, to which she should
think proper to retire<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 76.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas and Sir Ed∣ward
Stanley, sons to the earl of Derby, Sir Thomas
Gerrard, Rolstone, and other gentlemen, whose in∣terest
lay in the neighbourhood of the place where
Mary resided, concurred in the same views, and re∣quired,
that, in order to facilitate the execution of
the scheme, a diversion should, in the mean time, be
made from the side of Flanders<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 98.</NOTE>. Norfolk discourag∣ed,
and even in appearance suppressed, these conspi∣racies;
both because his duty to Elizabeth would not
allow him to think of effecting his purpose by rebel∣lion,
and because he foresaw, that, if the Queen of
Scots came into the possession of these men, they would
rather choose for her husband the King of Spain, or
some foreign prince, who had power, as well as incli∣nation,
to re-establish the catholic religion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN men of honour and good principles, like
the duke of Norfolk, engage in dangerous enterpri∣zes,
they are commonly so unfortunate as to be crimi∣nal
by halves; and while they ballance between the
execution of their designs and their remorses, their
fear of punishment and their hope of pardon, they ren∣der
<PB N="168" REF="185"/>
themselves an easy prey to their enemies. The
duke, in order to repress the surmizes, spread against
him, spoke contemptuously to Elizabeth of the Scots
alliance; affirmed that his estate in England was more
valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wasted by
civil wars and factions; and declared, that, when he
amused himself in his own-tennis court at Norwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
amidst his friends and vassals, he esteemed himself at
least a petty prince, and was fully contented with his
condition<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420.</NOTE>. Finding, that he did not convince her
by these asseverations, and that he was looked on with
a jealous eye by the courtiers, he retired to his coun∣try-seat
without taking leave<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 528.</NOTE>. He soon after repent∣ed
of this measure, and set out on his return to court,
with a view of using every expedient to regain the
Queen's good graces; but he was met at St. Albans
by Fitz-Garret, lieutenant of the band of pensioners,
by whom he was conveyed to Burnham, three miles
from Windsor, where the court then resided<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 339.</NOTE>. He
was soon after committed to the Tower, under the
custody of Sir Henry Nevil<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 421. Haynes, p. 540.</NOTE>. Lesley, bishop of Ross,
the Queen of Scots ambassador, was examined and
confronted with Norfolk before the council<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 80.</NOTE>. The
earl of Pembroke was confined to his own house:
Arundel, Lumley, and Throcmorton were taken in∣to
custody. The Queen of Scots herself was remov∣ed
to Coventry; all access to her was, during some
time, more strictly prohibited; and the viscount He∣reford
was joined to the earls of Shrewsbury and
Huntingdon, in the office of guarding her.</P>
<P>ARUMOUR had been very generally diffused in the
north of an intended rebellion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tions in the north.</NOTE> and the earl of Sussex,
president of York, alarmed with the danger sent for
Northumberland and Westmoreland, in order to ex∣amine
them; but not finding any proof against them,
<PB N="169" REF="186"/>
he allowed them to depart. The report meanwhile
gained ground daily; and many appearances of its
reality being discovered, orders were dispatched by
Elizabeth to these two noblemen, to appear at court,
and answer for their conduct<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 552.</NOTE> They had already
proceeded so far in their criminal designs, that they
dared not to trust themselves in her hands: They had
prepared measures for a rebellion; had communicated
their design to Mary and her ministers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 595. Strype, vol. II. append. p. 30. MS. in the Advocate's Library from Cott. Lib. Cal. c. 9.</NOTE>; had entered
into a correspondence with the duke of Alva, gover∣nor
of the Low Countries; had obtained his promise
of a reinforcement of troops, and of a supply of arms
and ammunition; and had prevailed on him to send
over to London Chiapini Vitelli, one of his most fa∣mous
captains, on pretence of adjusting some differ∣ences
with the Queen, but in reality with a view of
putting him at the head of the northern rebels. The
summons sent to the two earls, precipitated the ri∣sing
before they were fully prepared; and Northum∣berland
remained in suspence between opposite dan∣gers,
when he was informed, that some of his ene∣mies
were on the way with a commission to arrest
him. He took horse instantly, and hastened to his
associate Westmoreland, whom he found surround∣ed
with his friends and vassals, and deliberating with
regard to the measures, which he should follow in the
present emergence. They determined to begin the in∣surrection
without delay; and the great credit of these
two noblemen, with that zeal for the catholic religion,
which still prevailed in the neighbourhood, soon drew
together multitudes of the common people. They
published a manifesto, in which they maintained, that
they intended to attempt nothing against the Queen,
to whom they vowed unshaken allegiance; and
that their sole aim was to re-establish the religion
of their ancestors, to remove evil counsellors, and to
<PB N="170" REF="187"/>
restore the duke of Norfolk and other faithful peers
to their liberty and to the Queen's favour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 169. Strype, vol. I. p. 547.</NOTE>. Their
number amounted to four thousand foot and sixteen
hundred horse, and they expected the concurrence of
all the catholics in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 663.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen was not negligent in her defence, and
she had beforehand, from her prudent and wise con∣duct,
acquired the general good will of her people,
the best security of a sovereign; insomuch that even
the catholics in most counties expressed an affection
for her service<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 170. Digges, p. 4.</NOTE>; and the duke of Norfolk himself,
tho' he had lost her favour, and lay in confinement,
was not wanting, as far as his situation permitted, to
promote the levies among his friends and retainers.
Sussex, attended with the earls of Rutland, the lords
Hunsdon, Evers, and Willoughby of Parham, marched
against the rebels at the head of seven thousand men,
and found them already advanced to the bishoprick
of Durham, of which they had taken possession.
They retired before him to Hexham; and hearing that
the earl of Warwic and lord Clinton were advancing
against them with a greater body, they found no other
expedient but to disperse themselves without striking
a blow. The common people retired to their houses:
The leaders fled into Scotland. Northumberland
was found skulking in that country, and was confined
by Murray to the castle of Lochlevin. Westmoreland
received shelter from the chieftanes of the Kers and
Scots, partizans of Mary; and persuaded them to make
an inroad into England, with a view of exciting a
quarrel between the two kingdoms. After they had
committed great ravages, they retreated to their own
country; and Westmoreland made his escape into Flan∣ders,
where he was protected. This sudden and pre∣cipitate
rebellion was followed soon after by another
still more imprudent, raised by Leonard Dacres. Lord
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>
Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sdon, at the head of the garrison of Berwic, was
able, without other assistance, to quell these rebels.
Great severity was exercised against those, who had
taken part in these rash enterprizes. Sixty-six petty
constables were hanged<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>; and no less than eight
hundred persons are said, on the whole, to have suffer∣ed
by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 82.</NOTE>. But the Queen
was so well pleased with Norfolk's behaviour, that she
released him from the Tower, allowed him to live un∣der
some shew of confinement in his own house, and
only exacted a promise from him not to proceed any
farther in his pretensions to marriage with the Queen
of Scots<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 98. Camden, p. 429. Haynes, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found that the detention of Mary
was attended with all the ill consequences, which she
had foreseen when she first embraced that measure.
This latter princess recovering, by means of her mis∣fortunes
and her own natural good sense, from that de∣lirium,
in which she seems to have been thrown during
her attachment to Bothwel, had behaved with such
modesty and judgment, and even dignity, that every<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one, who approached her, was charmed with her demea∣nor;
and her friends were enabled, on some plausible
grounds, to deny the reality of all those crimes, which
had been imputed to her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 232. Haynes, p. 511.</NOTE>. The compassion for her
situation, and the necessity of effecting her relief, prov∣ed
an incitement among all her partizans to be active
in promoting her cause; and as her delivery from cap∣tivity,
it was thought, could no wise be effected but by
attempts, dangerous to the established government, Eli∣zabeth
had reason to expect little tranquillity so long
as the Scottish Queen remained a prisoner in her hands.
But as this inconvenience had been preferred to the
danger of allowing that princess to enjoy her liberty,
and to seek relief in all the catholic courts of Europe, it
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>
behoved the Queen to support the measure which she had
adopted, and to guard by every prudent expedient
against the mischiefs to which it was exposed. She still
flattered Mary with hopes of her protection, maintain∣ed
an ambiguous conduct between that Queen and her
enemies in Scotland, negotiated perpetually concerning
the terms of her restoration, made constant professions
of friendship to her; and by these arti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ices endeavoured
both to prevent her from making any desperate efforts
for her delivery, and to satisfy the French and Spanish
ambassadors, who never intermitted their sollicitations,
sometimes accompanied with menaces, in her favour.
This deceit was received with the same deceit by the
Queen of Scots: Professions of confidence were returned
by professions equally insincere: And while an appear∣ance
of friendship was maintained on both sides▪ the
animosity and jealousy, which had long prevailed be∣tween
them, was every day becoming more inveterate
and incurable. These two princesses, in address, capa∣city,
activity, and spirit, were nearly a match for each
other; but unhappily, Mary, besides her present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
condition, was always inferior in personal conduct and
discretion, as well as in power, to her illustrious ri∣val.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH
and Mary wrote at the same time letters
to the regent. The Queen of Scots desired, that her
marriage with Bothwel might be examined, and a di∣vorce
be legally pronounced between them. The Queen
of England gave Murray the choice of three conditions;
that Mary should be restored to her dignity on certain
terms; that she should be associated with her son, and
the administration remain in the regent's hands, till the
young prince should come to years of discretion; or
that she should be allowed to live at liberty as a private
person in Scotland, and have an honourable settlement
made in her favour<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">MSS. in the advacate's library. A. 329. p. 137. from Cott. Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Murray summoned a conventi∣on,
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>
in order to deliberate on these proposals of the two
Queens. No answer was made by them to Mary's letter,
on pretence that she had there maintained the style of
a sovereign, addressing herself to her subjects; but in
reality, because they saw that her request was calculated
to prepare the way for a marriage with Norfolk, or some
powerful prince, who could support her cause, and re∣store
her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth,
that the two former conditions were so derogatory to
the royal authority of their prince, that they could not
so much as deliberate concerning them: The third alone
could be the subject of treaty. It was evident, that
Elizabeth, in proposing conditions so unequal in their
importance, invited the Scots to a refusal of those which
were most advontageous to Mary; and as it was diffi∣cult,
if not impossible, to adjust all the terms of the
third, so as to render it secure and eligible to all parties,
it was concluded that she was not sincere in any of
them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sporswood, p. 230, 231. Lesly, p, 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is pretended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1570</NOTE> that Murray had entered into a pri∣vate
negociation with the Queen, to get Mary deli∣vered
into his hands<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 425. Lesly, p. 83.</NOTE>; and as Elizabeth sound the de∣tention of her in England so dangerous, it is probable,
that she would have been pleased, on any honourable
or safe terms, to rid herself of a prisoner who gave her
so much inquietude<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">By Murden's state papers, published after the printing of this passage, it appears, that an agreement had been made between Elizabeth and the regent for the delivery of Mary. The Queen afterwards sent down Killi∣grew to the earl of Marre when regent, offering to deliver up Mary to him. Killigrew was instructed to take good security from the regent, that that Queen should be tryed for her crimes, and that the sentence should be execut∣ed upon her. It appears that Marre refused the offer; because we hear no more of it.</NOTE> But all these projects vanished
by the sudden death of the regent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 January.</NOTE> who was assassinated,
in revenge of a private injury, by a gentleman of the
name of Hamilton. Murray was a person of conside∣rable
<PB N="174" REF="191"/>
vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassination of the earl of Murray.</NOTE> ability, and constancy; but tho' he was
not unsuccessful, during his regency, in composing the
dissensions in Scotland, his talents shone out more emi∣nently
in the beginning than in the end of his life.
His manners were rough and austere; and he possessed
not that perfect integrity, which frequently accom∣panies,
and can alone atone for, that unamiable cha∣racter.</P>
<P>By
the death of the regent, Scotland relapsed into
its former anarchy. Mary's party assembled together
and made themselves masters of Edinburgh. The cas∣tle,
commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, seemed to fa∣vour
her cause; and as many of the principal nobility
had embraced that side, it became probable, tho' the
people were in general averse to her, that her authority
might again acquire the ascendant. To check its pro∣gress,
Elizabeth dispatched Sussex, with an army, to the
North, under colour of chastizing the ravages commit∣ted
by the borderers. He entered Scotland, and laid
waste the lands of the Kers and Scots, seized the castle
of Hume, and committed hostilities on all Mary's par∣tizans,
who, he said, had offended his mistress, by har∣bouring
the English rebels. Sir William Drury was
afterwards sent with a body of troops, and he threw
down the houses of the Hamiltons, who were engaged
in the same faction. The English armies were after∣wards
recalled by agreement with the Queen of Scots,
who promised, that no French troops should be intro∣duced
into Scotland, and that the English rebels should
be delivered up to the Queen by her partizans<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen, covering herself with the pre∣tence
of revenging her own quarrel, so far contributed
to support the party of the young King, she was cauti∣ous
not to declare openly against the Queen of Scots,
and she even sent a request, which was equal to a com∣mand,
to the enemies of that princess, not to elect,
<PB N="175" REF="192"/>
during some time, a regent in the place of Murray<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 240.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">157.</NOTE>.
Lenox, the King's grandfather, was, therefore, chosen
temporary governor, under the title of Lieutenant.
Hearing afterwards that Mary's partizans, instead of
delivering up Westmoreland, and the other-fugitives, as
they had promised, had allowed them to escape into
Flanders; she permitted the King's party to give Lenox
the title of regent<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>, and she sent Randolf, as her resi∣dent,
to maintain a correspondence with him. But
notwithstanding this step, taken in favour of Mary's
enemies, she never laid aside her ambiguous conduct, or
quitted the pretensions of amity to that princess. Be∣ing
importuned by the bishop of Ross, and her other
agents, as well as by foreign ambassadors, she twice pro∣cured
a suspension of arms between the Scots factions,
and by that means stopped the hands of the regent, who
was likely to obtain advantages over the opposite par∣ty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 243.</NOTE>. By these seeming contrarieties she kept alive the
factions in Scotland, increased their mutual animosity,
and rendered the whole country a scene of devastation
and of misery<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 136.</NOTE>. She had no intention to conquer the
kingdom, and consequently no interest or design to in∣stigate
the parties against each other; but this conse∣quence
was an accidental effect of her cautious politics,
by which she was engaged, as far as possible, to keep on
good terms with the Queen of Scots, and never to vi∣olate
the appearances of friendship with her, at least
those of neutrality<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir James Melvil, p. 108, 109, ascribes to Elizabeth a positive design of animating the Scots factions against each other; but his evidence is too inconsiderable to counterballance many other authorities, and is, indeed, contrary to her subsequent conduct, as well as her interests, and the necessity of her situation. It was plainly her interest, that the King's party should prevail, and nothing could have engaged her to stop their progress, or even forbear from openly assisting them, but her intention of still amusing the Queen of Scots, by the hopes of being peaceably restored to her throne. See farther, Strype, vol. II. Appen. p. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="193"/>
THE better to amuse Mary with the prospect of an
accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildway were
sent to her with proposals from Elizabeth. The terms
were somewhat rigorous, such as a captive Queen
might expect from a jealous rival; and they thereby
bore the greater appearance of sincerity on the part of
the English court. It was required, that the Queen
of Scots, besides renouncing all title to the crown of
England during the life-time of Elizabeth, should make
a perpetual league, offensive and defensive, between
the kingdoms; that she should marry no Englishman
without Elizabeth's consent, nor any other person
without the consent of the states of Scotland; that re
dress should be made for the late ravages committed in
England; that justice should be executed on the mur∣derers
of the late King; that the young prince should
be sent into England, to be educated there; that six hos∣tages,
all of them noblemen, should be delivered to the
Queen of England, with the castle of Hume, and some
other fortress, for the security of performance<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 245. Lesly, p. 101s.</NOTE> Such
were the conditions upon which Elizabeth promised to
contribute her endeavours towards the restoration of
the deposed Queen. The necessity of Mary's affairs
obliged her to consent to them; and the Kings of
France and Spain, as well as the pope, when consulted
by her, approved of her conduct; chiefly on account of
the civil wars by which all Europe was at that time agi∣tated,
and which incapacitated the catholic princes
from giving her any assistance<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lesly, p. 109. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH's commissioners proposed also to Mary
a plan of accommodation with her subjects in Scotland;
and after some reasoning on that head, it was agreed, that
the Queen should require Lenox, the regent, to send up
commissioners, to treat of conditions under her mediation.
The partizans of Mary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted, that all terms were fully
settled with the court of England, and that the Scots
<PB N="177" REF="194"/>
rebels would soon be constrained to submit to the resto∣ration
of their sovereign: But Elizabeth took care that
these rumours should meet with no credit, and that the
King's party should not be discouraged, nor sink too
low in their demands. Cecil wrote to inform the regent,
that all the Queen of England's proposals, so far from
being fixed and irrevocable, were to be discussed anew
in the conference; and desired him to send commissio∣ners,
who should be constant to the King's cause, and
cautious not to make concessions which might be pre∣judicial
to their party<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 245.</NOTE> Sussex also, in his letters,
dropped hints to the same purpose; and Elizabeth her∣self
said to the abbot of Dunfermling, whom Lenox
had sent to the court of England, that she would not
insist on Mary's restoration, provided the Scots could
make the justice of their cause appear to her satisfaction;
and that even, if their reasons should fall short of full
conviction, she would take effectual care to provide for
their future security<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots Parliament appointed the Earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1571. 1st of March<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
the Abbot of Dunfermling, and Sir James Macgill to
manage the treaty. These commissioners first present∣ed
memorials, containing reasons for the deposition of
their Queen; and they seconded their arguments, with
examples drawn from the Scots history, with the autho∣rity
of laws, and with the sentiments of many famous
divines. The lofty ideas, which Elizabeth had enter∣tained
of the absolute, indefeizable right of sovereigns,
made her be shocked with these republican topics; and
she told the Scots commissioners, that she was no-wise
satisfied with their reasons for justifying the conduct of
their countrymen; and that they might therefore pro∣ceed
to open the conditions, which they required for
their security<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 248, 249.</NOTE>. They replied, that their commission
did not empower them to treat of any terms, which
<PB N="178" REF="195"/>
might infringe the title and sovereignty of their young
king; but they would gladly hear whatever proposals
should be made them by her majesty. The conditi∣ons,
recommended by the Queen, were not disadvan∣tageous
to Mary; but as the commissioners still insisted
that they were not authorized to treat, in any manner,
concerning the restoration of that Princess<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Haynes, 623.</NOTE>, the con∣ferences
were necessarily at an end; and Elizabeth dis∣missed
the Scots commissioners with injunctions, that
they should return, after having procured more ample
powers from their Parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 249, 250, &amp;c. Lesly, p. 133, 136 Camden, p. 431, 432.</NOTE>. The bishop of Ross
complained openly to the English council, that they had
abused his mistress by fair promises and professions; and
Mary herself was no longer at a loss to judge of Eliza∣beth's
insincerity. By reason of these disappointments,
matters came still nearer to extremity between the two
Princesses; and the Queen of Scots, finding all her hopes
eluded, was more strongly incited to make, at all ha∣zards,
every possible attempt for her liberty and securi∣ty.</P>
<P>AN
incident also happened about this time, which tended
to widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth, and
to encrease the vigilance and jealousy of the latter Prin∣cess.
Pope Pius the fifth, who had succeeded Paul, after
having endeavoured in vain to conciliate by gentle means
the friendship of Elizabeth, whom his predecessor's vio∣lence
had irritated, issued at last a bull of excommuni∣cation
against her, deprived her of all title to the crown,
and absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 427.</NOTE>.
It seems probable, that this attack on the Queen's au∣thority
was made in concert with Mary, who intended
by that means to forward the northern rebellion; a mea∣sure
which was at that time projected<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 441, from Cajetanus' life of Pius the sith.</NOTE>. John Felton
affixed this bull to the gates of the bishop of London's
<PB N="179" REF="196"/>
palace; and scorning either to fly or deny the fact, he
was seized, and condemned, and received the crown of
martyrdom, for which he appears to have entertained so
violent an ambition<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 428.</NOTE></P>
<P>A new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> after five years interval, was as∣sembled
at Westminster; and as the Queen, by the rage
of the pope against her, was become still more the head
of the ruling party, it might be expected, both from this
incident and from her own prudent and vigorous con∣duct,
that her authority over the two houses would be
absolutely uncontroulable. It was so in fact; yet it is
remarkable, that it prevailed not without some small
opposition; and that too arising chiefly from the height
of zeal for protestantism; a disposition of the English,
which, in general, contributed extremely to encrease
the Queen's popularity. We shall be somewhat parti∣cular
in relating the transactions of this session, because
they show, as well the extent of the royal power during
that age, as the disposition of Elizabeth and the genius
of her government. It will be curious also to observe
the faint dawnings of the spirit of liberty in the English,
the jealousy with which that spirit was repressed by the
sovereign, the imperious conduct which was maintained
in opposition to it, and the ease with which it was sub∣dued
by this arbitrary Princess.</P>
<P>THE Lord keeper, Bacon, after the speaker of the
commons was elected, told the Parliament, in the
Queen's name, that she enjoined them not to meddle
with any matters of state<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>: Such was his expression;
by which he probably meant, the questions of the
Queen's marriage and the succession, about which they
had before given her some trouble: For as to the other
great points of government, alliances, peace and war,
or foreign negotiations; no Parliament in that age ever
ventured to take them under consideration, or que∣stion,
in these particulars, the conduct of their sove∣reign.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="197"/>
IN the former Parliament, the puritans had intro∣duced
seven bills for a farther reformation in religion;
but they had not been able to prevail in any one of
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 18</NOTE>. This house of commons had sat a very few
days, when Stricland, a member, revived one of the
bills, that for the amendment of the liturgy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 156, 157.</NOTE>. The
chief objection, which he mentioned, was the sign of
the cross in baptism. Another member added, the
kneeling at the sacrament; and remarked, that if a
posture of humiliation was requisite in that act of
devotion, it were better that the communicants
should throw themselves prostrate on the ground, in
order to keep at the widest distance from former fu∣perstition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was a point, of which Elizabeth was,
if possible, still more jealous than of matters of state.
She pretended, that, in quality of supreme head or go∣vernor
of the church, she was fully empowered, by her
prerogative alone, to decide all questions which might
arise with regard to doctrine, discipline, or worship;
and she never would allow her Parliaments so much as
to take these points into consideration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE> The courtiers
forgot not to insist on this topic: The treasurer of the
houshold, tho' he allowed, that any heresy might be
condemned by Parliament, (a concession which seems
to have been very rash and unguarded; since the act,
investing the crown with the supremacy, or rather re∣cognizing
that prerogative, gave the sovereign full power
to reform all heresies) yet he affirmed, that it belonged
to the Queen alone, as head of the church, to regulate
every question of ceremony in worship<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE> The comp∣troller
seconded this argument; insisted on the extent
of the Queen's prerogative; and said, that the house
might, from former examples, have taken warning not
to meddle with such matters. One Pistor opposed these
remonstrance of the courtiers. He was scandalized,
<PB N="181" REF="198"/>
he said, that affairs of such infinite consequence (viz.
kneeling and making the sign of the cross) should be
passed over so lightly. These questions, he added, con∣cern
the salvation of our souls, and interest every one
of us more deeply than the monarchy of the whole
world. This cause he shewed to be God's; the rest
were all but terrene, yea trifles in comparison, call
you them ever so great: Subsidies, crowns, kingdoms,
he knew not what weight they had, when laid in the
ballance with subjects of such unspeakable importance<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 166.</NOTE>
Tho' the zeal of this member seems to have been highly
approved of, the house, overawed by the prerogative,
voted upon the question, that a petition should be pre∣sented
to her majesty, for her licence to proceed farther
in this bill; and in the mean time to stop all debate or
reasoning concerning it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE></P>
<P>MATTERS would probably have rested here, had not
the Queen been so highly offended with Stricland's pre∣sumption,
in moving the bill for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>formation of the
liturgy, that she sent for him to the council, and pro∣hibited
him thenceforth to appear in the house of com∣mons<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. That act of power was too violent even for
this submissive Parliament to endure. Carleton took
notice of the matter, complained that the liberties of
the house were violated; observed that Stricland was
not a private man, but represented a multitude; and
moved, that he might be sent for, and, if he was guilty
of any offence, might answer for it at the bar of the
house, which he insinuated to be the only competent
tribunal<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty
with still greater boldness. He said, that the precedent
was dangerous: And tho' in this happy time of lenity,
among so many good and honourable personages as
were at present invested with authority, nothing of
extremity or injury was to be apprehended; yet the
times might alter; what now is permitted, hereafter
might be construed as duty, and might be enforced even
<PB N="182" REF="199"/>
on the ground of the present permission. He added,
that all matters not treasonable, or which implied <HI>too
much</HI> derogation of the imperial crown, might, without
offence, be introduced into Parliament, where every
question that concerned the community must be con∣sidered,
and where even the right of the crown itself
must finally be determined. He remarked, that men
sat not in that house in their private capacities, but as
elected by their country; and tho' it was proper, that
the prince should retain his prerogative, yet was that
prerogative limited by law: As the sovereign could not
of himself make laws, neither could he break them,
merely from his own authority<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175, 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE principles were popular, and noble, and ge∣nerous;
but the open assertion of them was, at that
time, somewhat new in England: And the courtiers
were more warranted by present practice, when they
advanced a contrary doctrine. The treasurer warned
the house to be cautious in their proceedings; neither
to venture farther than their assured warrant might ex∣tend,
nor hazard their good opinion with her majesty in
any doubtful cause. The member, he said, whom
they required, was not detained on account of any
liberty of speech, but for the exhibiting a bill in the
house against the prerogative of the Queen; a temerity
which was not to be tolerated. And he concluded with
observing, that even speeches made in that house, have
been questioned and examined by the sovereign<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>.
Cleere, another member, remarked, that the sovereign's
prerogative is not so much as disputable, and that the
safety of the Queen is the safety of the subjects. He
added, that, in questions of divinity, every man was
for his instruction to repair to his ordinary; and he
seems to insinuate, that the bishops themselves, for their
instruction, must repair to the Queen<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Mr. Fleet∣wood
observed, that, in his memory, he knew a man,
<PB N="183" REF="200"/>
who, in the fifth of the present Queen, had been called
to account for a speech in the house. But lest this
example should be too recent, he would inform them,
from the parliament rolls, that in the reign of Henry
the fifth, a bishop was committed to prison by the
King's command, on account of his freedom of speech;
and the Parliament presumed not to go farther than to
be humble suitors for him: In the subsequent reign the
speaker himself was committed, with another member;
and the house found no other remedy than a like sub∣missive
application. He advised the house to have re∣course
to the same expedient; and not to presume,
either to send for their member, or demand him as of
right<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 176.</NOTE>. During this speech, those members of the
council who sat in the house, whispered together;
upon which the speaker moved, that the house should
make stay of all farther proceedings: A motion, which
was immediately complied with. The Queen finding
that the experiment which she had made, was likely to
exite a great commotion, saved her honour by this
silence of the house; and that the question might
no more be resumed, she sent next day to Stricland
her permission to give his attendance in Parlia∣ment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this rebuke from the throne, the
zeal of the commons still engaged them to continue the
discussion of those other bills which regarded religion;
but they were interrupted by a still more arbitrary pro∣ceeding
of the Queen, in which the lords condescended
to be her instrument. That house sent a message to
the commons, desiring that a committee might attend
them. Some members were accordingly appointed for
that purpose; and the upper house informed them,
that the Queen's majesty being informed of the ar∣ticles
of reformation which they had canvassed, approv∣ed
of them, intended to publish them, and to make the
<PB N="184" REF="201"/>
bishops execute them, by virtue of her regal authority,
as supreme head of the church of England: But that
she would not permit them to be treated of in Parlia∣ment<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 180, 185.</NOTE>.
The house, tho' they did not entirely stop
proceedings on account of this injunction, seem to
have been no-wise offended at such haughty treat∣ment;
and in the issue all their bills came to no∣thing.</P>
<P>A
MOTION, made by Robert Bell, a puritan, against
an exclusive patent granted to a company of merchants
at Bristol<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 159.</NOTE>, gave also occasion to some remarkable
incidents. The Queen, some days after the motion
was made, sent her orders, by the mouth of the speak∣er,
commanding the house to spend little time in
motions, and to avoid long speeches. All the members
understood that she had been offended, because a matter
had been moved which seemed to touch her preroga∣tive<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 159.</NOTE>.
Fleetwood accordingly spoke of this delicate
subject. He observed, that the Queen had a prerogative
of granting patents; that to question the validity of any
patent, was to invade the royal prerogative; that all
foreign trade was entirely subjected to the pleasure of
the sovereign; that even the statute which gave liberty
of commerce, admitted of all prohibitions from the
crown; and that the prince, when he granted an ex∣clusive
patent, only employed the power vested in him,
and prohibited all others from dealing in any particular
branch of commerce. He quoted the Clerk of the
Parliament's book, to prove, that no man might speak
in Parliament of the statute of wills, unless the King
first gave licence; because the royal prerogative in
the wards was thereby touched. He shewed likewise
the statutes of Edward the first, Edward the third, and
Henry the fourth, with a saving of the prerogative.
And in Edward the sixth's time, the protector was
<PB N="185" REF="202"/>
applied to, for his allowance to mention matters of pre∣rogative<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant sea-adventurer,
carried these topics still farther. He endeavoured to
prove the motion made by Bell to be a vain device,
and perilous to be treated of; since it tended to the
derogation of the prerogative imperial, which whoever
should attempt so much as in fancy, could not, he said,
be otherwise accounted than an open enemy. For what
difference is there between saying, that the Queen is
not to use the privilege of the crown, and saying that
she is not Queen? And tho' experience has shewn so
much clemency in her majesty, as might, perhaps,
make the subjects forget their duty; it is not good to
sport or venture too much with princes. He remem∣bered
them of the fable of the hare, who, upon the
proclamation, that all horned beasts should depart the
court, immediately fled, lest his ears should be constru∣ed
to be horns; and by this apologue he seems to in∣sinuate,
that even those who heard or permitted such
dangerous speeches, would not themselves be entirely
free from danger. He desired them to beware, lest,
if they meddled farther with these matters, the Queen
might look to her own power, and finding herself able to
suppress their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbi∣trary
authority, might imitate the example of Lewis
the eleventh of France, who, as he termed it, delivered
the crown from wardship.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' this speech gave some disgust, no body, at
the time, replied any thing, but that Sir Humphrey
mistook the meaning of the house, and of the member
who made the motion: They never had other purpose,
than to represent their grievances in due and seemly
form unto her majesty. But, in a subsequent debate,
Peter Wentworth, a man of a superior free spirit, called
that speech an insult on the house; noted Sir Hum∣phrey's
<PB N="186" REF="203"/>
disposition to flatter and fawn on the prince;
compared him to the cameleon, which can change it self
into all colours, except white; and recommended to
the house, a due care of liberty of speech, and of the
privileges of Parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175.</NOTE>. It appears, on the whole,
that the motion against the exclusive patent had no
effect. Bell, the member who first introduced it, was
sent for by the council, and was severely reprimanded
for his temerity. He returned to the house with such an
amazed countenance, that all the members, well in∣formed
of the reason, were struck with terror; and
during some time, no one durst rise to speak of any
matter of importance, for fear of giving offence to the
Queen and the council. Even after the fears of the
commons were somewhat abated, the members spoke
with extreme precaution; and by employing most of
their discourse in preambles and apologies, they shewed
their conscious terror of the rod which was hanging
over them. Wherever any delicate point was touched
tho' ever so gently; nay seemed to be approached, tho'
at ever so great a distance, the whisper ran about the
house, “The Queen will be offended; the council
will be extremely displeased:” And by these sur∣mizes
men were warned of the danger to which they
exposed themselves. It is remarkable, that the patent
which the Queen defended with such imperious vio∣lence,
was contrived for the profit of four courtiers,
and was attended with the utter ruin of seven or eight
thousand of her industrious subjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS every thing which passed the two houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> was
extremely respectful and submissive; yet did the Queen
think it incumbent on her, at the conclusion of the sessi∣on,
to check, and that with great severity, those feeble
efforts for liberty, which had appeared in the motions
and speeches of some members. The lord keeper told
the commons, in her majesty's name, that, tho' the ma∣jority
of the lower house had shewed themselves, in
<PB N="187" REF="204"/>
their proceedings, discreet and dutiful, yet a few of
them had discovered a contrary character, and had just∣ly
merited the reproach of audacious, arrogant, and pre∣sumptuous:
Contrary to their duty, both as subjects
and parliament-men, nay contrary to the express in∣junctions
given them from the throne at the beginning
of the session; injunctions, which it might well have be∣come
them to have better attended to; they had presum∣ed
to call in question her majesty's grants and preroga∣tives.
But her majesty warns them, that since they
will thus wilfully forget themselves, they are otherwise
to be admonished: Some other species of correction must
be found for them; since neither the commands of her
majesty, nor the example of their wiser brethren, can
reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and presumptuous
folly, by which they are thus led to meddle with what
no way belongs to them, and what lies not within the
compass of their understanding<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all these transactions appears clearly the opinion
which Elizabeth had entertained of the duty and autho∣rity
of Parliaments. They were not to canvass any
matters of state: Still less were they to meddle with
the church. Questions of either kind were far above
their reach, and were appropriated to the prince alone,
or to those councils and ministers with whom he was
pleased to entrust them. What then was the office of
Parliaments? They might give directions for the due
tanning of leather, or milling of cloth; for the preser∣vation
of pheasants and partridges; for the reparation of
bridges and highways; for the punishment of vagabonds
or common beggars. Regulations concerning the po∣lice
of the country came properly under their inspec∣tion;
and the laws of this kind which they prescribed,
had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority, than
those derived solely from the proclamations of the sove∣reign.
Precedents or reports could six a rule for deci∣sions
<PB N="188" REF="205"/>
in private property, or the punishment of crimes;
but no alteration or innovation in the municipal law
could proceed from any other source than the Parlia∣ment;
nor would the courts of justice be induced to
change their established practice by an order of council.
But the most acceptable part of parliamentary transac∣tions
was the granting of subsidies; the attainting and
punishing the obnoxious nobility, or any minister of
state after his fall; the countenancing such great efforts
of power, as might be deemed somewhat exceptionable,
when they proceeded entirely from the sovereign. The
redress of grievances was sometimes promised to the
people; but seldom could have place, while it was an
established rule, that the prerogatives of the crown must
not be abridged, or so much as questioned and exa∣mined
in Parliament. Even tho' monopolies and exclu∣sive
companies had already reached an enormous height,
and were every day encreasing, to the destruction of all
liberty, and extinction of all industry; it was criminal
in a member to propose, in the most dutiful and regular
manner, a parliamentary application against any of
them.</P>
<P>THESE maxims of government were not kept secret
by Elizabeth, or smoothed over by any fair appearances
or plausible pretences. They were openly avowed in
her speeches and messages to Parliament; and were ac∣companied
with all the haughtiness, nay sometimes bit∣terness
of expression, which the meanest servant could
look for from his offended master. Yet notwithstand∣ing
this conduct, Elizabeth continued to be the most po∣pular
sovereign that ever swayed the scepter of England;
because the maxims of her reign were conformable to
the principles of the times, and to the opinion which
was generally entertained with regard to the constitution.
The continued encroachments of popular assemblies on
Elizabeth's successors have so changed our ideas of these
matters, that the passages above mentioned appear to
<PB N="189" REF="206"/>
us extremely curious, and even at first surprizing; but
they were so little remarked, during the time, that
neither Camden, tho' a contemporary writer, nor any
other historian, has taken any notice of them. So ab∣solute
was the authority of the crown, that the preci∣ous
spark of liberty had been kindled, and was pre∣served,
by the puritans alone; and it was to this sect,
whose principles appear so frivolous and habits so ridi∣culous,
that the English owe the whole freedom of their
constitution. Actuated by that zeal which belongs to
innovators, and by the courage which enthusiasm in∣spires,
they hazarded the utmost indignation of their
sovereign; and employing all their industry to be elec∣ted
into Parliament; a matter not difficult, while a seat
was rather regarded as a burthen than an advantage<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It appeared this session, that a bribe of four pounds had been given to a mayor for a seat in Parliament. D'Ewes, p. 181. It is probable, that the member had no other view but the privilege of being free from arrests.</NOTE>;
they first acquired a majority in that assembly, and then
obtained an ascendant over the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>THE following were the principal laws enacted this
session of Parliament. It was declared Ereason, during
the life-time of the Queen, to affirm, that she was not
the lawful sovereign, or that any other possessed a bet∣ter
title, or that she was a heretic, schismatic, or insidel,
or that the laws and statutes cannot limit and determine
the right of the crown and the successor thereof: To
maintain in writing or printing, that any person, ex∣cept
the <HI>natural issue</HI> of her body, is or ought to be the
Queen's heir or successor, subjected the person and all
his abettors, for the first offence, to imprisonment dur∣ing
a year, and to the forfeiture of half their goods: The
second offence subjected them to the penalty of a premu∣nire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>.
This law was plainly leveled against the Queen
of Scots and her partizans; and implyed an avowal,
that Elizabeth never intended to declare her successor. It
may be noted, that the usual phrase of <HI>lawful issue,</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="207"/>
which the Parliament thought indecent towards the
Queen, as if she could be supposed to have any other,
was changed into that of <HI>natural issue.</HI> But this altera∣tion
was the source of great ridicule during the time;
and some persons suspected a deeper design, as if Lei∣cester
intended, in case of the Queen's death, to produce
some bastard of his own, and affirm that he was her
offspring<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was also enacted, that whosoever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bulls shall
publish absolutions or other rescripts of the pope, or
shall by means of them reconcile any man to the church
of Rome, such offenders, as well as those who were so
reconciled, should be guilty of treason. The penalty
of a premunire was imposed on every one who imported
any <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> crucifix, or such other implement of su∣perstition,
consecrated by the pope<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE>. The former laws
against taking interest, which was denominated usury,
were enforced by a new statute<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 8.</NOTE>. A supply of one sub∣sidy
and two fifteenths was granted by Parliament.
The Queen; as she was determined to yield to them
none of her power, was very cautious of asking them
for any supplies. She endeavoured, either by a rigid
frugality to make her ordinary revehues suffice for the
necessities of the crown, or she employed her preroga∣tive
and acquired money by the granting of patents,
monopolies, or by some such ruinous expedient.</P>
<P>THO' Elizabeth possessed such uncontrouled autho∣rity
over her parliaments, and such extensive influence
over her people; tho' during a course of thirteen years,
she had been able to maintain the public tranquillity,
which was only interrupted by the hasty and ill-con∣certed
insurrection of the north; she was still kept in
great anxiety, and felt her throne perpetually totter un∣der
her. The violent commotions, excited in France
and the Low Countries, as well as in Scotland, seemed
in one view to secure her against any disturbance; but
<PB N="191" REF="208"/>
they served, on more reflection, to instruct her in the
danger of her situation, when she remarked, that Eng∣land,
no less than these neighbouring countries, contain∣ed
the seeds of intestine discord, the differences of re∣ligious
opinion, and the furious intolerance and ani∣mosity
of the opposite sectaries.</P>
<P>THE league,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> at Bayonne in 1566 for the ex∣termination
of the protestants, had not been concluded
so secretly but intelligence of it had reached Condé, Co∣ligni,
and the other leaders of the hugonots; and find∣ing,
that the measures of the court agreed with their
suspicions, they determined to prevent the cruel perfidy
of their enemies, and to strike a blow before the catho∣lics
were aware of the danger. The hugonots, tho'
dispersed over the whole kingdom, formed a kind of
separate empire; and being closely united, as well by
their religious zeal, as by the dangers, to which they
were perpetually exposed, they obeyed with entire sub∣mission
the orders of their leaders, and were ready on
every alarm to fly to arms. The King and Queen
mother were living in great security at Monceaux in
Brie; when they found themselves surrounded by pro∣testant
troops, which had secretly marched thither from
all quarters; and had not a body of Swiss come hastily
to their relief, and conducted them with great intrepi∣dity
to Paris, they must have fallen, without resistance,
into the hands of the malecontents. A battle was af∣terwards
fought in the plains of St. Dennis, where,
tho' the old constable Montmorency, the general of the
catholics, was killed combating bravely at the head of
his troops, the hugonots were finally defeated. Condé
collecting his broken troops, and receiving a strong re∣inforcement
from the German protestants, appeared
again in the field; and laying siege to Chartres, a place
of great importance, obliged the court to agree to a
new accommodation. Such was the mutual animosity
of these religionists, that, even had the leaders on both
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides been ever so sincere in their intentions for peace,
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="192" REF="211"/>
and reposed ever so great confidence in each other, it
would have been difficult to have retained the people in
tranquillity; much more, where such extreme jealousy
prevailed, and where the court employed every pacifica∣tion
as a snare for their enemies. A plan was laid for
feizing the person of the prince and admiral; who nar∣rowly
escaped to Rochelle, and summoned their parti∣zans
to their assistance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The civil wars were renew∣ed
with greater fury than ever, and the parties became
still more exasperated against each other. The young
duke of Anjou, brother to the King, commanded the
forces of the catholics; and fought in 1569 a great bat∣tle
at Jarnac with the hugonots, where the prince of
Condé was killed, and his army defeated. This discom∣fiture,
with the loss of so great a leader, reduced not the
hugonots to despair. The admiral still supported the
cause; and having placed at the head of the protestants,
the prince of Navarre, then sixteen years of age, and
the young prince of Condé, he encouraged the party
rather to perish bravely in the field, than ignominiously
by the hands of the executioner. He collected such
numbers, so determined to endure every extremity,
that he was enabled to make head against the duke of
Anjou; and being strengthened by a new reinforce∣ment
of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and
to divide his forces. Coligni then laid siege to Poi∣tiers;
and as the eyes of all France were turned on this
enterprize, the duke of Guise, emulous of the renown,
which his father had acquired by the defence of Mentz,
threw himself into the place, and so animated the garri∣son
by his valour and conduct, that the admiral was
obliged to raise the fiege. Such was the commence∣ment
of that unrivaled same and grandeur, afterwards
attained by this duke of Guise. The attachment, which
all the catholics had borne to his father, was immedi∣ately
transferred to the son; and men pleased themselves
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
in comparing all the great and heroic qualities, which
seemed, in a manner, hereditary in that family. Equal
in affability, in munificence, in address, in eloquence,
and in every quality, which engages the affections of
men; equal also in valour, in conduct, in enterprize,
in capacity; there seemed only this difference between
them, that the son, educated in more turbulent times,
and finding a greater dissolution of all law and order,
exceeded the father in ambition and temerity, and was
engaged in enterprizes still more destructive to the au∣thority
of his sovereign and to the repose of his native
country.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who kept her attention fixed on the
civil commotions of France, was no wise pleased with
this new rise of her enemies, the Guises; and being
anxious for the fate of the protestants, whose interests
were connected with her own<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 471.</NOTE>, she was engaged, not∣withstanding
her aversion against all rebellion, and all
opposition to the will of the sovereign, to give them se∣cretly
some assistance. Besides employing her authori∣ty
with the German princes, she sent money to the
Queen of Navarre, and received some jewels as pledges
for the loan. And she permitted Henry Champernon
to levy, and transport over into France, a regiment of
an hundred gentlemen voluntiers; among whom Wal∣ter
Raleigh, then a young man, began to distinguish
himself in that great school of military valour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>. The
admiral, constrained by the impatience of his troops,
and by the difficulty of subsisting them, fought with the
duke of Aujou, the battle of Moncontour in Poictou,
where he was wounded and defeated. The court of
France, notwithstanding their frequent experience of
the obstinacy of the hugonots, and the vigour of Co∣ligni,
vainly flattered themselves that the force of the
rebels was at last finally annihilated; and they neglec∣ted
farther preparations against a foe, who, they thought,
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
could never more become dangerous. They were sur∣prized
to hear, that that leader had appeared in another
quarter of the kingdom; had encouraged the young
princes, whom he governed, to equal constancy; had
assembled an army; had taken the field; and was even
strong enough to threaten Paris. The public finances,
diminished by the continued disorders of the kingdom,
and wasted by so many fruitless military enterprizes,
could no longer bear the charge of a new armament;
and the King, notwithstanding his extreme animosity
against the hugonots, was obliged, in 1570, to conclude
an accommodation with them, to grant them a pardon
for all past offences, and to renew the edicts for liberty
of conscience.</P>
<P>THO' a pacification was feemingly concluded, the
mind of Charles was no wise reconciled to his rebellious
subjects; and this accommodation, like all the forego∣ing,
was nothing but a snare, by which the perfidious
court had projected to destroy at once, without danger,
all its formidable enemies. As the two young princes,
the admiral, and all the leaders of the hugonots, instru∣cted
by past experience, discovered an extreme distrust
of the King's intentions, and kept themselves in secu∣rity,
at a distance, all possible artifices were employed
to remove their apprehensions, and convince them of the
sincerity of the new counsels, which seemed to be
embraced. The terms of the peace were strictly ob∣served
to them; the toleration was regularly maintain∣ed;
all attempts, made by the zealous catholics to in∣fringe
it, were punished with severity; offices, and
favours, and honours were bestowed on the principal
nobility among the protestants; and the King and
council every where declared, that, tired of civil disor∣ders,
and convinced of the impossibility of forcing men's
consciences, they were thenceforth determined to allow
every one the free exercise of his religion.</P>
<P>AMONG the other artifices, employed to lull the pro∣testants
into a fatal security, Charles affected to enter
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
into close connexions with Elizabeth; and as it seemed
not the interest of France to forward the union of the
two kingdoms of Great Britain, that princess the more
easily flattered herself, that the French monarch would
prefer her friendship to that of the Queen of Scots.
The better to deceive her, proposals of marriage were
made her with the duke of Anjou; a prince whose
youth, beauty, and reputation for valour might natu∣rally
be supposed to recommend him to a woman, who
had appeared not altogether indifferent to these en∣dowments.
The Queen immediately founded on this
offer the project of deceiving the court of France; and
being intent on the artifice of that scheme, she laid
herself the more open to be deceived. Negotiations
were entered into with regard to the marriage; terms
of the contract were proposed; difficulties started and
removed; and the two courts, equally insincere, tho'
not equally criminal, seemed to approach every day
nearer to each other in their demands and concessions.
The great obstacle seemed to lie in adjusting the differ∣ences
of religion; because Elizabeth, who recommend∣ed
toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant
it in her own dominions, not even to her husband;
and the duke of Anjou seemed unwilling to submit,
for the sake of interest, to the dishonour of an aposta∣cy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 433. Davila, lib. 5. Digges's Compleat Ambassador, p. 84, 110, 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed
so much in any contrivances as in those which were
conjoined with her coquetry; and as her character in
this particular was generally known, the court of
France thought that they might, without danger of
forming any final conclusion, venture the farther in their
concessions and offers to her. The Queen also had
other motives for dissimulation. Besides the advantage
of discouraging Mary's partizans by the prospect of an
alliance between France and England, her situation
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
with Philip demanded her utmost vigilance and at∣tention;
and the present revolutions in the Low
Countries made her glad of fortifying herself even
with the appearance of a new confederacy.</P>
<P>THE theological controversies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Low-Countries.</NOTE> which had long agi∣tated
Europe, had, from the beginning, penetrated
into the Low Countries; and as these provinces main∣tained
a very extensive commerce, they had early re∣ceived
from every kingdom, with which they corres∣ponded,
a tincture of religious, innovation. An opi∣nion
at that time prevailed, which had been zealously
propagated by the priests, and implicity received by
sovereigns, that heresy was closely connected with re∣bellion,
and that every great or violent alteration in
the church involved a like revolution in the state and
civil government. The forward zeal of the reformers
would seldom allow them to wait the consent of the
magistrate to their innovations; they became less du∣tiful
when they were opposed and persecuted; and tho'
their pretended spirit of reasoning and enquiry was in
reality, among the greatest part of them, nothing but
a new species of implicit faith, the prince took the
alarm; as if no institutions could be secure from the
temerity of their researches. The emperor Charles,
who proposed to augment his authority under the pre∣tence
of defending the catholic faith, easily adopted
these political principles; and notwithstanding the
limited prerogative, which he possessed in the Nether∣lands,
he published the most arbitrary, severe, and
tyrannical edicts against the protestants, and he took
care that the execution of them should be no less violent
and sanguinary. He was neither cruel nor bigotted
in his natural disposition; yet an historian, celebrated
for moderation and caution, has computed, that, in
the several persecutions, promoted by that monarch,
no less than an hundred thousand persons perished by the
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
hands of the executioner<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Grotii Annal. lib. 1. Father Paul, another great authority, computes, in a passage above cited, that 50,000 persons were put to death in the Low-Countries alone.</NOTE>. But these severe remedies,
so far from answering the purpose intended, had rather
served to augment the numbers as well as zeal of the
reformers; and the magistrates of the several towns,
seeing no end of those barbarous executions, felt
their humanity rebel against their principles, and de∣clined
any farther persecution of the new doctrines.</P>
<P>WHEN Philip succeeded to his father's dominions,
the Flemings were justly alarmed with new apprehen∣sions;
lest their prince, observing the lenity of the
magistrates, should take the execution of the edicts
from such remiss hands, and should establish the in∣quisition
in the Low Countries, accompanied with all
the iniquities and barbarities which attended it in Spain.
The severe and unrelenting character of the man, his
professed attachment to Spanish manners, the inflexible
bigotry of his principles; all these circumstances en∣creased
their terror: And when he left the Netherlands,
with a known intention never to return, the dis∣gust
of the inhabitants was extremely augmented, and
their dread of those tyrannical orders, which their so∣vereign,
surrounded with Spanish ministers, would issue
from his cabinet of Madrid. He left the dutchess of
Parma governess of the Low Countries and the natural
good sense and good temper of that princess, had she
been entrusted with the sole power, would have pre∣served
the submission of those opulent provinces,
which were lost from that refinement of treacherous
and barbarous politics, on which Philip so highly
valued himself. The Flemings found, that the name
alone of regent remained with the dutchess; that
cardinal Granville possessed entirely the King's con∣fidence;
that attempts were every day made on
their liberties; that a resolution was taken never
more to assemble the states; that new bishoprics were
arbitrarily erected, in order to enforce the executi∣on
<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
of the persecuting edicts; and that on the whole,
they must make account of being reduced to the con∣dition
of a province under the Spanish monarchy.
The discontents of the nobility gave countenance to
the complaints of the gentry, which encouraged the
mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men showed
a strong disposition to revolt. Associations were form∣ed,
tumultuary petitions presented, names of distincti∣on
assumed, badges of party displayed; and the current
of the people, impelled by religious zeal and irritated
by feeble resistance, rose to such a height, that in
sevetal towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made
an open invasion on the established worship, pillaged
the churches and monasteries, broke the images,
and committed the most unwarrantable disorders.</P>
<P>THE wiser part of the nobility, particularly the prince
of Orange, and the counts Egmont and Horn, were
alarmed with these excesses, to which their own dis∣contents
had at first given countenauce; and second∣ing
the wisdom of the governess, they suppressed those
dangerous insurrections, punished the ringleaders,
and reduced all the provinces to a state of order and
submission. But Philip was not contented with the
re-establishment of his antient authority: He con∣sidered,
that provinces, so remote from the seat of
government, could not be ruled by a limited prerogative;
and that a prince, who must entreat rather than com∣mand,
would necessarily, when he resided not among
the people, feel every day a diminution of his power
and influence. He determined, therefore, to lay hold
of the late popular mutinies as a pretence for abolishing
entirely the privileges of the Low Country provinces;
and for ruling them thenceforth with a military and
arbitrary authority. In the execution of this violent
design, he employed a man, who was a proper in∣strument
in the hands of such a tyrant Ferdinand of
Toledo, duke of Alva, had been educated entirely
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
amidst arms; and having attained a consummate know∣lege
in the military art, his habits led him to transfer
into all government the severe discipline of a camp,
and to conceive no measures between prince and sub∣ject
but those of rigid command and implicit obedience.
This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to
the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spa∣niards;
and his avowed animosity to the Flemings, with
his known character, struck that whole people with
terror and consternation. It belongs not to our sub∣ject
to relate at length those violences, with Alva's na∣tural
barbarity, steeled by reflection, and aggravat∣ed
by insolence exercised on those flourishing pro∣vinces.
It suffices to say, that all their privileges, the
gift of so many princes, and the inheritance of so
many ages, were openly and expressly abolished by
edict; arbitrary and sanguinary tribunals erected; the
counts Egmont and Horn, notwithstanding their great
merits and past services, brought to the scaffold; mul∣titudes
of all ranks thrown into prison; and thence deli∣vered
over to the executioner: And notwithstanding the
peaceable submission of allmen, nothing was heard of but
confiscation, imprisonment, exile, torture, and death.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was equally displeased to see the progress
of that scheme, laid for the extermination of the pro∣testants,
and to observe the erection of so great a mili∣tary
power, in a state situated so near her. She gave
protection to all the Flemish exiles who took shelter in
her dominions; and as many of these were the most
industrious inhabitants of the Netherlands, and had ren∣dered
that country so celebrated for its arts, she reaped
the advantage of introducing into England some useful
manufactures, which were formerly unknown in that
kingdom. Foreseeing that the violent government of
Alva could not long subsist without exciting some com∣motion,
she ventured to commit an insult upon him,
which she would have been cautious not to hazard
against a more established authority. Some Gonoese mer∣chants
<PB N="220" REF="219"/>
had engaged by contract with Philip, to transport
into Flanders the sum of four hundred thousand crowns;
and the vessels in which this money was embarked, had
been attacked in the Channel by some privateers equip∣ed
by the French Hugonots, and had taken shelter in
Plymouth and Southampton. The commanders of the
ships pretended, that the money belonged to the King
of Spain; but the Queen finding, upon enquiry, that it
was the property of Genoese merchants, took possession
of it as a loan; and by that means deprived the duke
of Alva of this resource in the time of his greatest ne∣cessity.
Alva, in revenge, seized all the English mer∣chants
in the Low Countries, threw them into pri∣son,
and confiscated their effects. The Queen retalia∣ted
by a like violence on the Flemish and Spanish mer∣chants;
and gave all the English liberty to make repri∣zals
on the subjects of Philip. These differences were
afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual repara∣tions
were made to the merchants: But nothing could
repair the loss which so well-timed a blow inflicted on
the Spanish government in the Low Countries. Alva,
in want of money, and dreading the immediate muti∣ny
of his troops, to whom large arrears were due, impo∣sed
by his arbitrary will the most ruinous taxes on the
people. He not only required the hundredth penny,
and the twentieth of all immoveable goods: He also de∣manded
the tenth of all moveable goods on every sale;
an absured tyranny, which would not only have destroy∣ed
all arts and commerce, but even have restrained the
common intercourse of life. The people refused com∣pliance:
The duke had recourse to his usual expedient
of hanging: And thus matters came still nearer the last
extremity betweent the Flemings and the Spaniards<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part I. lib. V. Camden, p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the enemies of Elizabeth, in order to revenge
themselves for her insults, had naturally recourse to one
policy, the supporting the cause and pretensions of the
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
Queen of Scots;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1751.</NOTE> and Alva, whose measures were ever
violent, soon opened a secret intercourse with that prin∣cess.
There was one Rodolphi, a Florentine mer∣chant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New
con∣spiracy of the duke of Norfolk.</NOTE> who had resided about fifteen years in London,
and who, at the same time that he conducted his com∣merce
in England, had managed all the intrigues of the
court of Rome with the catholic nobility and gentry<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Lesley. p. 123. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87.</NOTE>.
He had been thrown into prison at the time when the
duke of Norfolk's intrigues with Mary were discovered;
but either no proof was found against him, or the part
which he had acted was not very criminal; and he soon
after recovered his liberty. This man, zealous for pro∣moting
the catholic faith, had formed a scheme, in con∣cert
with the Spanish ambassador, for subverting the go∣vernment,
by a foreign invasion, and a domestic insur∣rection;
and when he communicated his project, by
letter, to Mary, he found, that as she was now fully
convinced of Elizabeth's artifices, and despaired of ever
recovering her authority, or even her liberty, by paci∣fic
measures, she very willingly gave her concurrence.
The great number of discontented catholics were the
chief source of their hopes on the side of England; and
they also observed, that the kingdom was, at that time,
full of indigent gentry chiefly younger brothers, who
having at present, by the late decay of the church, and
the yet languishing state of commerce, no prospect of
a livelihood suitable to their birth, were ready to throw
themselves into any desperate enterprize<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 123.</NOTE>. But in or∣der
to inspire spirit and courage into all these malecon∣tents,
it was requisite, that some great nobleman should
put himself at their head; and no one appeared to Ro∣dolphi,
and to the bishop of Ross, who entered into all
these intrigues, so proper, both on account of his pow∣er
and his popularity, as the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, when released from confinement in
the Tower, had given his promise, that he would drop
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
all intercourse with the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 571.</NOTE>; but find∣ing
that he had lost, and, as he feared, beyond all reco∣very,
the confidence and favour of Elizabeth, and be∣ing
still, in some degree, restrained from his liberty, he
was tempted, by impatience and despair, to violate his
word, and to open anew his correspondence with the
captive princess<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 102.</NOTE>. A promise of marriage was renew∣ed
between them; the duke engaged to enter into all
her interests; and as his remorses gradually decayed in
the course of these transactions, he was pushed to give
his assent to enterprizes still more criminal. Rodol∣phi's
plan was, that the duke of Alva should, on some
other pretence, assemble a great quantity of shipping in
the Low countries; should transport a body of six
thousand foot, and four thousand horse, into England;
should land them at Harwich, where the duke of Nor∣folk
was to join them with all his friends; should thence
march directly to London, and oblige the Queen to
submit to whatever conditions the conspirators should
please to impose upon her<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 155. State Trials, vol. I. p. 86, 87.</NOTE>. Norfolk gave his consent
to this plan; and three letters in consequence of it,
were wrote in his name by Rodolphi, one to Alva, ano∣ther
to the pope, and a third to the King of Spain; but
the duke, apprehensive of the danger, refused to sign
them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 159, 161. Camden, p. 432.</NOTE>. He only sent to the Spanish ambassador a
servant and confident, named Barker, as well to noti∣fy
his concurrence in the plan, as to vouch for the
authenticity of these letters; and Rodolphi, having ob∣tained
a letter of credence from the ambassador, pro∣ceeded
on his journey to Brussels and to Rome. The
duke of Alva and the pope embraced the scheme with
alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intenti∣ons<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 93.</NOTE>;
and every thing seemed to concur in forwarding
the undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="222"/>
NORFOLK, notwithstanding these criminal enterpri∣zes,
had never entirely forgot his duty to his sovereign,
his country, and his religion; and tho' he had laid the
plan both for an invasion and an insurrection, he still
flattered himself, that the innocence of his intentions
would justify the violence of his measures, and that, as
he aimed at nothing but the liberty of the Queen of
Scots, and the obtaining Elizabeth's consent to his mar∣riage,
he could not justly reproach himself as a rebel
and a traitor<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Lesley, p. 158.</NOTE>. It is certain, however, that, consider∣ing
the Queen's vigour and spirit, the scheme, if suc∣cessful,
must finally have ended in her dethronement;
and her authority was here exposed to the utmost dan∣ger.
The conspiracy had hitherto entirely escaped the
vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of secretary Cecil, who
now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was from ano∣ther
attempt of Norfolk, that they first obtained a hint,
which, being diligently traced, led at last to a full dis∣covery.
Mary had intended to send a sum of money to
lord Herreis, and her partizans in Scotland; and Nor∣folk
undertook to have it conveyed to Bannister, a ser∣vant
of his, at that time in the north, who was to find
some expedient to have it delivered to lord Herreis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87. C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mden, p. 434. Digges, p. 134, 137, 140. Strype, vol. II. p. 82.</NOTE>. He
entrusted the money to a servant, who was not in the
secret, and told him that the bag contained a sum of
silver, which he was to deliver to Bannister with a let∣ter:
But the servant, conjecturing from the weight and
size of the bag, that it was full of gold, carried the let∣ter
to Burleigh; who immediately ordered Bannister,
Barker, and Hicford, the duke's secretary, to be put
under arrest, and to undergoe a severe examination. The
torture made them confess the whole truth; and as
Hicford, tho' ordered to burn all papers, had carefully
kept them concealed under the mats of the duke's cham∣ber,
and under the tiles of the house, full evidence now
<PB N="204" REF="223"/>
appeared against his master<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">lesley, p. 173.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE> Norfolk himself, who
was entirely ignorant of the discoveries made by his
servants, was brought before the council, and tho' ex∣horted
to atone for his guilt by a full confession, he per∣sisted
in denying every accusation with which he was
charged. The Queen always declared, that if he had
given her this proof of his sincere repentance, she would
have pardoned all his former offences<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>; but finding
him obstinate, she committed him to the Tower, and
ordered him to be brought to his trial. The bishop of
Ross had, on some suspicion, been committed to cus∣tody
before the discovery of Norfolk's guilt; and eve∣ry
expedient was employed to make him reveal his share
in the▪ conspiracy. He at first insisted on his privilege
as an ambassador; but he was told, that as his mistress
was no longer a sovereign, he would not be regarded
as an ambassador, and that even if that character was al∣lowed,
it did not warrant him in conspiring against the
sovereign in whose court he resided<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 189. Spotwood.</NOTE>. As he still refu∣sed
to answer interrogatories, he was informed of the
confession made by Norfolk's servants; after which he
entertained no longer any scruple to make a full disco∣very,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1572.</NOTE>
and his evidence put the guilt of that nobleman
beyond all question. A jury of twenty-five peers una∣nimously
passed sentence upon him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 January. Trial of Norfolk.</NOTE> The trial was
quite regular, even according to the strict rules obser∣ved
at present in these matters; except that the wit∣nesses
gave not their evidence in court, and were not

which was not at that time observed in trials for high
treason.</P>
<P>THE Queen still hesitated concerning Norfolk's ex∣ecution;
whether that she was really moved by friend∣ship
and compassion, towards a peer of that rank and
merit, or, that affecting the praise of clemency, she on∣ly
put on the appearance of these sentiments. Twice
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
she signed a warrant for his execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1569.</NOTE> and twice revo∣ked
the fatal sentence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Carte, p. 527. from Fenelon's dispatches. Digges, p. 166. Strype, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 83.</NOTE>; and tho' her ministers and
counsellors pushed her to rigour, she still appeared ir∣resolute
and undetermined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu∣tion.</NOTE> After four months hesita∣tion,
a Parliament was assembled; and the commons

and certainty of his guilt, would, she thought,
justify, in the eyes of all the world, her severity against
that nobleman. Norfolk died with great calmness and
constancy; and tho' he cleared himself of any disloyal
intentions against the Queen's authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 June.</NOTE> he acknow∣leged
the justice of the sentence by which he suffer∣ed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 440. Strype, vol. II. App. p. 23.</NOTE>.
That we may relate together affairs of a like na∣ture,
we shall mention, that the earl of Northumberland,
being delivered up to the Queen by the regent of Scot∣land,
was also a few months after brought to the scaf∣fold
for his rebellion.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots was either the occasion or the
cause of all these disturbances; but as she was a so∣vereign
princess, and might reasonably, from the harsh
treatment which she had met with, think herself entit∣led
to use any expedient for her relief, Elizabeth durst
not, as yet, form any resolution of proceeding to extre∣mity
against her. She only sent lord Delawar, Sir
Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Dr. Wilson,
to expostulate with her, and to require satisfaction for
all those parts of her conduct, which, from the begin∣ning
of her life, had given exception to Elizabeth: Her
assuning the arms of England, refusing to ratify the
treaty of Edinburgh, her intending to marry No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>folk
without the Queen's consent, her concurring in the
northern rebellion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 16, 107. Strype. vol. II. p. 51, 52.</NOTE>, practising with Rodolphi to engage
the King of Spain in an invasion of England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 194, 208, 209. Strype, vol. II. p. 40, 51.</NOTE>, procu∣ring
<PB N="206" REF="225"/>
the pope's bull of excommunication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1572.</NOTE> and allowing
her friends abroad to give her the title of Queen of
England. Mary justified herself from the several arti∣cles
of this charge, either by denying the facts imputed
to her, or by throwing the blame on others<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 442.</NOTE>. But the
Queen was little satisfied with her apology; and the
Parliament was so enraged against her, that the com∣mons
made a direct application for her immediate trial
and execution. They employed some topics derived
from practice and reason, and the laws of nations; but
the chief stress was laid on passages and examples from
the Old Testament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 207, 208, &amp;c.</NOTE>, which, if considered as a general
rule of conduct, (an intention which it is unreasonable
to suppose) would imply consequences dangerous to all
the principles of humanity and morality. Matters were
here carried farther than Elizabeth intended; and be∣ing
satisfied with shewing Mary the disposition of the
nation, she sent to the house her express commands not
to deal any farther at present in the affair of the Scot∣tish
Queen<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 21<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 241.</NOTE>. Nothing could be a stronger proof that
the puritanical interest prevailed in the house, than the
intemperate use of authorities derived from scripture, es∣pecially
from the Old Testament; and the Queen was
so little a lover of that sect, that she was not likely to
make any concession merely in deference to their sollici∣tation.
She shewed this session her disapprobation of their
schemes in another remarkable instance. There had
passed in the lower house two bills, for regulating eccle∣siastical
ceremonies; but she sent them a like imperious
message with the foregoing, and by the terror of her
prerogative stopt all farther proceedings<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 213, 238.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Elizabeth would not proceed to such ex∣tremities
against Mary, as were recommended to her
by the Parliament, she was alarmed with the great in∣terest
and the restless spirit of that princess, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
her closd connections with Spain; and she thought it
necessary both to increase the rigour and strictness of her
confinement, and to follow maxims different from what
she had hitherto pursued in her management of Scot∣land<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 152.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1527.</NOTE>
That kingdom remained still in a state of anar∣chy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots
affairs.</NOTE> The castle of Edingburgh, commandeded by
Kirkaldy of Grange, had de clared for the Queen; and
the lords of that party, encouraged by his countenance,
had taken possession of the capital, and carried on a
vigorous war against the regent. By a sudden and un∣expected
inroad, they seized that nobleman at Stirling;
but finding that his friends, sallying from the castle,
were likely to relieve him, they instantly put him to
death. The earl of Marre was chosen regent in his
place; and found the same difficulties to encounter in
the government of that divided country. He was
therefore glad to accept of the mediation of the French
and English ambassadors, and to conclude on equal
terms a truce with the Queen's party<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 263.</NOTE>. He was a man
of a free and generous spirit, and scorned to submit to
any dependance on England; and for this reason Eliza∣beth,
who had formed close connections with France,
yielded with less reluctance to the sollicitations of that
court, still maintained the appearance of neutrality bet∣ween
the parties, and allowed matters to remain on
a ballance in Scotland<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. p. 156, 165, 169.</NOTE>. But affairs soon after took a
new turn: Marre died of melancholy, with which the
distracted state of the country affected him: Morton
was chosen regent; and as this nobleman had secretly
taken all his measures with Elizabeth, who no longer
relied on the frienship of the French court, she resolved
to exert herself more effectually for the support of that
party, whom she had always favoured. She sent Sir
Henry Killigrew ambassador into Scotland, who found
Mary's partizans so discouraged by the discovery and
<PB N="208" REF="227"/>
punishment of Norfolk's conspiracy, that they were
glad to submit to the King's authority, and accept of
an indemnity for all past offences<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 268.</NOTE>. The duke of
Chatelrault, and the earl of Huntley, with the most
considerable of Mary's friends, laid down their arms on
these conditions. The garrison alone of the castle of
Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy's fortunes
were desperate; and he flattered himself with the hopes
of receiving assistance from the Kings of France and
Spain, who encouraged his obstinacy, in the view of
being able, from that quarter, to give disturbance
to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the dan∣ger;
she no more apprehended the making an en∣tire
breach with the Queen of Scots, who, she found,
could not any longer be amused by her artisices; she
had an implicite reliance on Morton; and she saw,
that, by the submission of all the considerable nobility,
the paci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication of Scotland would be an easy, as well
as a most important undertaking. She, therefore, or∣dered
Sir William Drury, governor of Berwic, to
march with some troops and artillery to Edinburgh,
and to besiege the castle<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 449.</NOTE>. The gar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ison submitted at
discretion; Kirkaldy was delivered to his countrymen,
by whom he was tried and executed: Secretary Liding∣ton,
who had taken part with him, died soon after a
voluntary death, as is supposed; and Scotland, submit∣ting
entirely to the regent, gave not, during a long time,
any farther inquietude to Elizabeth.</P>
<P>THE events which happened in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch affairs.</NOTE> were not
so agreeable to the Queen's interests and inclinations.
The fallacious pacifications, which had been so often
made with the Hugonots, gave them good reason to
suspect the present intentions of the court; and after
all the other leaders of that party were deceived into
a dangerous credulity, the sagacious admiral still re∣mained
doubtful and uncertain. But his suspicions were
<PB N="209" REF="228"/>
at last overcome, partly by the profound dissimulation
of Charles, partly by his own earnest desire to end the
miseries of France, and return again to the performance
of his duty towards his prince and country. He con∣sidered
besides, that as the former violent conduct of
the court had ever met with such fatal success, it was
not unlikely, that a prince, who had newly come to
years of discretion, and appeared not to be rivetted
in any dangerous animosities or prejudices, would
be induced to govern himself by more moderate
maxims. And as Charles was young, was of a pas∣sionate
hasty temper, and addicted to pleasure<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 8, 39.</NOTE>, such
deep perfidy seemed either remote from his character, or
difficult, and almost impossible to be so uniformly sup∣ported
by him. Moved by these considerations, the
admiral, the Queen of Navarre, and all the Hugonots
began to repose themselves in full security, and gave
credit to the treacherous caresses and professions of the
French court. Elizabeth herself, notwithstanding her
great experience and penetration, entertained not the
least mistrust of Charles's sincerity; and being pleased
to find her enemies of the house of Guise removed from
all authority, and to observe an animosity every day
growing between the French and Spanish monarchs,
she concluded a defensive league with the former<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 443.</NOTE>,
and regarded this alliance as an invincible barrier to
her throne. Walsingham, her ambassador sent her
over, by every courier, the most satisfactory accounts
of the honour, and plain-dealing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> and fidelity of that
perfidious prince.</P>
<P>THE better to blind the eyes of the jealous Hugo∣nots
and draw their leaders into the snare prepared
for them, Charles offered his sister, Margaret, in mar∣riage
to the prince of Navarre; and the admiral, with
all the considerable nobility of that party, had come to
Paris, in order to assist at the celebration of these nup∣tials,
<PB N="210" REF="229"/>
which, it was hoped, would finally, if not com∣pose
the differences, at least appease the bloody ani∣mosity
of the two religions. The Queen of Navarre
was poisoned by orders from the court; the admiral
was dangerously wounded by an assassin: Yet Charles,
by redoubling his dissimulation, was still able to re∣tain
the Hugonots in their security: Till on the evening
of St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 August.</NOTE> Bartholomew, a few days after the marriage,
the signal was given for a general massacre of those re∣ligionists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacre
of Paris.</NOTE> and the King himself in person led the way
to these assassinations. The hatred long entertained
by the Parisians against the protestants, made them
second, without any preparation, the fury of the court;
and all conditions, ages and sexes, suspected of any
propensity to that religion, were involved in an undis∣tinguished
ruin. The admiral, his son in-law Teligni,
Soubize, Rochefoucaut, Pardaillon, Piles, Lavardin;
men, who, during the late wars, had distinguished
themselves by the most heroic actior were miserably
butchered without resistance; the streets of Paris flowed
with blood; and the people more enraged than satiated
with their cuelty, as if repining that death had saved
the victims from farther insult, exercised on their dead
bodies all the rage of the most licentious brutality.
About five hundred gentlemen and men of rank perished
in this massacre; and near ten thousand of inferior con∣dition<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. V.</NOTE>.
Orders were suddenly dispatched to all the
provinces for a like general execution of the protes∣tants;
and in Roüen, Lyons, and many other cities, the
people emulated the fury of the capital. Even the murder
of the King of Navarre, and the prince of Condé had been
proposed by the duke of Guise; but Charles, softened by
the amiable manners of the King of Nevarre, and hop∣ing
that these young princes might easily be converted to
the catholic faith, determined to spare their lives, tho' he
obliged them to purchase their safety by a seeming
change of their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="230"/>
CHARLES, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy,
pretended, that a conspiracy of the Hugonots to seize
his person had been suddenly discovered; and that he
had been necessitated, for his own defence, to pro∣ceed
to this severity against them. He sent orders to
Fenelon, his ambassador in England, to ask an audi∣ence,
and to give Elizabeth this account of the late
transaction. That minister, who was a man of pro∣bity,
abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court,
and even scrupled not to declare, that he was now
ashamed to bear the name of a Frenchman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247.</NOTE>; yet was
he obliged to obey his orders, and make use of the apo∣logy,
which had been prescribed to him. He met
with that reception from all the courtiers, which, he
knew, the conduct of his master had so well merited.
Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the
solemnity of his audience. A melancholy sorrow sat
on every face: Silence, as in the dead of night, reign∣ed
thro' all the chambers of the royal apartment: The
courtiers and ladies, clad in deep mourning, were rang∣ed
on each side, and allowed him to pass, without
affording him one salute or favourable look; till he was
admitted to the Queen herself<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Carte vol. III. p. 522. from Fenelon's Dispatches.</NOTE>. That princess receiv∣ed
him with a more easy, if not a more gracious coun∣tenance;
and heard his apology, without discovering
any visible symptoms of indignation. She then told
him, that, tho', on the first rumour of this dreadful in∣telligence,
she had been astonished, that so many brave
men and loyal subjects, who rested secure on the faith
of their sovereign, should have been suddenly butchered
in so barbarous a manner; she had hitherto suspended
her judgment, till farther and more certain information
should be brought her: That the account, which he
had given, even if founded on no mistake or bad infor∣mation;
tho' it might alleviate, would by no means
remove the blame of the King's counsellors, or justify

<PB N="211" REF="232"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="112" REF="233"/>
the strange irregularity of their proceedings: That the
same force, which without resistance had massacred so
many defenceless men, could easily have secured their
persons, and have reserved them for a trial, and for
punishment by a formal sentence, which would have
distinguished the innocent from the guilty; That the
admiral in particular, being dangerously wounded,
and environed by the guards of the King, on whose
protection he seemed entirely to rely, had no means
of escape, and might surely, before his death, have
been convicted of the crimes imputed to him: That it
was more worthy of a sovereign to reserve in his own
hands the sword of justice, than to commit it to bloody
murderers, who, being the declared and mortal ene∣mies
of the persons accused, employed it without mercy
and without distinction: That if these sentiments were
just, even supposing the conspiracy of the protestants
to be real; how much more so, if that crime was no∣thing
but a calumny of their enemies, invented for
their ruin and destruction? That if upon enquiry the
innocence of these unhappy victims should afterwards
appear, it was the King's duty to turn his vengeance
on their enemies and calumniators, who had thus cru∣elly
abused his confidence, had murdered so many of
his brave subjects, and had done what in them lay to
cover him with infamy and dishonour: And that for her
part, she should form her judgment of his intentions by
his subsequent conduct; and in the mean time should
act as desired by the ambassador, and rather pity than
blame his master for the extremities, to which he had
been carried<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was fully sensible of the dangerous
situation in which she now stood. In the massacre of
Paris, she saw the result of that general conspiracy,
which had been formed for the extermination of the
protestants; and she knew, that she herself, as the head
<PB N="213" REF="234"/>
and protector of that religion, was exposed to the ut∣most
fury and resentment of the catholics. The violen∣ces
and cruelties of the Spaniards in the Low Countries
were another branch of the same conspiracy; and as
Charles and Philip, two princes nearly allied in persidy
and barbarity, as well as in bigotry, had now laid aside
their pretended quarrel, and had avowed the most entire
friendship<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 26<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 282.</NOTE>, she had reason, so soon as they had ap∣peased
their domestic commotions, to dread the effects
of their united councils. The duke of Guise also and
his family, whom Charles, in order to deceive the
admiral, had hitherto kept at a distance, had now ac∣quired
an open <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and entire ascendant in the
court of France; and she was sensible, that these
princes, from personal as well as political reasons,
were her declared and implacable enemies. The
Queen of Scots, their near relation and close confede∣rate,
was the pretender to her throne; and tho' detain∣ed
in custody, was actuated by a restless spirit, and be∣sides
her foreign allies, possessed very numerous and
zealous partizans in the heart of the kingdom. For
these reasons, Elizabeth thought it more prudent not
to break all terms with the French monarch; but still
to listen to the professions of friendship, which he made
her. She allowed even the negotiations to be renewed
for her marriage with the duke of Alançon, Charles's
third brother<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. passim. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>: Those with the duke of Anjou had
already been broke off. She sent the earl of Worcester
to assist in her name at the baptism of a young prin∣cess,
born to Charles; but before she agreed to give
this last mark of condescension, she thought it becom∣ing
her dignity, to renew her expressions of blame and
even of detestation against the cruelties exercised on
his protestant subjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 297, 298. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>. Meanwhile, she prepared
herself for that attack, which seemed to threaten her
<PB N="214" REF="235"/>
from the combined power and violence of the Roma∣nists:
She fortified Portsmouth, put her fleet in order,
exercised her militia, cultivated popularity with her
subjects, acted with vigour for the farther reduction of
Scotland under obedience to the young King, and
renewed her alliance with the German princes, who
were no less alarmed than herself at these treacherous
and sanguinary measures, so universally embraced by
the catholics.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Elizabeth cautiously avoided the coming to
extremities with Charles, the greatest security, which
she possessed against his violence, was derived from the
difficulties, which the obstinate resistance of the hugo∣nots
still created to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af∣fairs.</NOTE> Such of that sect as lived
near the frontiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1573.</NOTE> immediately, on the first news of
the massacres, fled into England, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Germany or Swit∣zerland,
where they excited the compassion and indig∣nation
of the protestants, and prepared themselves,
with encreased forces and redoubled zeal, to return in∣to
France, and revenge the treacherous slaughter of
their brethren. Those who lived in the middle of the
kingdom, took shelter in the nearest garrisons occupied
by the hugonots; and finding, that they could repose no
faith in capitulations, and expect no clemency, were
determined to defend themselves to the last extremity.
The sect, which Charles had thought at one blow to
exterminate, had now an army of eighteen thousand
men on foot, and possessed in different parts of the
kingdom above an hundred cities, castles, or fortresses<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 343.</NOTE>;
nor could that prince deem himself secure from the in∣vasion
threatened him by all the other protestants of
Europe. The nobility and gentry of England were
rouzed to such a pitch of resentment, that they offer∣ed
to levy an army of twenty-two thousand soot and
four thousand horse, to transport them into France,
and to maintain them six months at their own charge:
<PB N="215" REF="236"/>
But Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1573.</NOTE> who was cautious in her measures,
and who feared to inflame the quarrel between the
two religions by these dangerous crusades, refused her
consent, and moderated the zeal of her subjects<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 335, 341.</NOTE>. The
German princes, less political, or more secure from
the resentment of France, forwarded the levies made
by the protestants; and the prince of Condé, having
escaped from court, put himself at the head of these
troops, and prepared to enter the kingdom. The duke
of Alençon, the King of Navarre, the family of Mont∣morenci,
and many considerable men even among the
catholics, displeased, either on a private or public
account, with the measures of the court, favoured the
progress of the hugonots; and every thing relapsed
into confusion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1574.</NOTE> The King, instead of repenting his
violent councils, which had brought matters to such
extremity, called aloud for new severities<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 5.</NOTE>; nor could
even the mortal distemper, under which he laboured,
moderate the rage and animosity, by which he was
actuated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th May.</NOTE> He died without male issue, at the age of
twenty-five years; a prince, whose character, contain∣ing
that unusual mixture of dissimulation and ferocity,
of quick resentment, and unrelenting vengenace, ex∣ecuted
the greatest mischiefs, and threatened still worse,
both to his native country and to all Europe. Henry,
duke of Anjou, who had, some time before, been elec∣ted
King of Poland, no sooner heard of his brother's
death, than he hastened to take possession of the crown
of France; and found the kingdom, not only invol∣ved
in the greatest present disorders, but exposed to
infirmities, for which it was extremely difficult to pro∣vide
any suitable remedy. The people were divided
into two theological factions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1575.</NOTE> furious from their zeal,
and mutually enraged from the injuries which they
had committed or received; and as all faith had been
violated and moderation banished, it seemed impracti∣cable
<PB N="216" REF="237"/>
to frame any terms of composition between them.
Each party had devoted itself to leaders, whose com∣mands
had more authority than the will of the sove∣reign;
and even the catholics, to whom the King was
attached, were conducted entirely by the councils of
Guise and his family. The religious connexions had,
on both sides, superseded the civil; or rather (for men
will always be guided by present interest) two em∣pires
being secretly formed in the kingdom, every in∣dividual
was engaged by new views of interest to fol∣low
those leaders, to whom, during the course of past
convulsions, he had been indebted for his honours and
preforment. Henry, observing the low condition of
the crown, had laid a scheme for restoring his own au∣thority,
by acting as umpire between the parties, by
moderating their differences, and by reducing both
to a dependance upon himself. He possessed all the
talents of dissimulation requisite for the execution of
this delicate plan; but being deficient in vigour, appli∣cation,
and sound understanding, instead of acquiring
a superiority over both factions, he lost the confidence
of both, and taught the partizans of each to adhere
more closely to their particular leaders, whom they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound more hearty, cordial, and sincere, in the cause,
which they pursued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1576.</NOTE> The hugonots were fortified by
the accession of a German army under the prince of
Condé and prince Casimir; but much more, by the
credit and personal virtues of the King of Navarre,
who, having fled from court, had placed himself at the
head of that formidable party. Henry, in prosecu∣tion
of his plan, entered into a composition with them;
and being desirous of preserving a balance between the
sects, he granted them peace on the most advantageous
conditions. This was the fifth general peace made
with the hugonots; but tho' it was no more sincere on
the part of the court than any of the former, it gave
the highest disgust to the catholics; and afforded the
<PB N="217" REF="238"/>
duke of Guise the desired pretence of declaiming
against the measures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1576.</NOTE> and maxims, and conduct of the
King. That artful and bold leader took thence an
occasion of reducing his party into a more formed and
regular body; and he laid the first foundations of the
famous LEAGUE, which, without paying any regard
to the royal authority, aimed at the entire suppression
of the hugonots. Such was the unhappy condition of
France, from the past severities and violences of its
princes, that toleration could no longer be admitted;
and a concession for liberty of conscience, which would
have probably appeased the reformers, excited the most
violent resentment and animosity in the catholics.
Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1577</NOTE> in order to divert the force of the league from
himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd even to elude its efforts against the hugo∣nots,
declared himself the head of that seditious con∣federacy,
and took the field as leader of the Romanists.
But his dilatory and feeble measures discovered his
reluctance to the undertaking; and after some unsuc∣cessful
attempts, he concluded a new peace, which,
tho' less favorable than the former to the protestants,
gave no contentment to the catholics. Mutual diffi∣dence
still prevailed between the parties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1578.</NOTE> the King's
moderation was suspicious to both; each faction con∣tinued
to fortify itself against that breach, which, they
foresaw, must speedily ensue; theologicla controversy
daily whetted the animosity of the sects; and every
private injury became the ground of a public quarrel.
The King, hoping, by his artifice and subtlety, to
allure the nation into a love of pleasure and repose,
was himself caught in the snare; and sinking into
dissoluteness and indolence, wholly lost the esteem,
and, in a great measure, the affections of the nation.
instead of advancing such men of character and ability,
as were neuters between these dangerous factions,
he gave all his confidence to young agreeable favour∣ites,
who, unable to prop his salling authority, leaned
<PB N="218" REF="239"/>
entirely upon it, and encreased the general odium against
his administration. The public burthens, encreased
by his profuse liberality, and feeling more heavy on a
disordered kingdom, became another ground of com∣plaint;
and the uncontrouled animosity of parties,
joined to the multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more
calamitous than any open state of foreign or even do∣mestic
hostility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1579.</NOTE> The artifices of the King were too
refined to succeed, and too frequent to be concealed;
and the plain, direct, and avowed conduct of the duke
of Guise on the one side, and that of the King of Na∣varre
on the other, drew by degrees the generality of
the nation to devote themselves without reserve to the
one or the other of those great leaders.</P>
<P>THE civil commotions of France were of too great
importance to be overlooked by the other princes of
Europe; and Elizabeth's foresight and vigilance, tho'
somewhat restrained by her frugality, led her to take
secretly some part in them. Besides employing on all
occasions her good offices in favour of the hugonots,
she had expended no inconsiderable sums of money in
levying that army of Germans, which the prince of
Condé and prince Casimir conducted into France<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>;
and notwithstanding all her negotiations with the court,
and her professions of amity, she always considered
her own interests as connected with the prosperity of
the French protestants and the depression of the house
of Guise. Philip, on the other hand, had declared
himself protector of the league; had entered into the
closest correspondence with Guise; and had employed
all his authority in supporting the credit of that fac∣tious
leader. The sympathy of religion, which of it∣self
begot a connexion of interests, was one conside∣rable
inducement; but that monarch had also in view,
the subduing his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands;
who, as they received great encouragement from the
<PB N="219" REF="240"/>
French protestants, would, he hoped, finally despair of
success, after the entire suppression of their friends and
confederates.</P>
<P>THE same political views, which engaged Elizabeth
to support the hugonots, would have led her to assist
the distressed protestants in the Low Countries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of the Low Countries.</NOTE> but
the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his
other dominions, and the great force, which he main∣tained
in these mutinous provinces, kept her in awe,
and obliged her, notwithstanding all temptations and
all provocations, to preserve some terms of amity with
that monarch. The Spanish ambassador remonstrated
to her, that many of the Flemish exiles, who infested
the seas, and preyed on his master's subjects, were re∣ceived
into the harbours of England, and were there
permitted to dispose of their prizes; and by these re∣monstrances
the Queen found herself under a necessi∣ty
of denying them all entrance into her dominions.
But this measure proved in the issue extremely preju∣dicial
to the interests of Philip. These desperate exiles,
finding no longer any possibility of subsistance, were
forced to attempt the most perilous enterprizes; and
they made an assault on the Brille, a seaport town in
Holland, where they met with success, and, after a
short resistance, became masters of the place<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 443.</NOTE>. The
duke of Alva was alarmed with the danger; and stop∣ping
those bloody executions, which he was making
on the defenceless Flemings, he hastened with his ar∣my
to extinguish the flame, which, falling on mate∣rials
so well prepared for combustion, seemed to me∣nace
a general conflagration. His fears soon appear∣ed
to be well grounded. The people in the neigh∣bourhood
of the Brille, enraged by that complication
of cruelty, oppression, insolence, usurpation, and per∣secution,
under which they laboured, flew to arms;
and in a few days almost the whole province of Hol∣land
<PB N="220" REF="241"/>
and that of Zealand had revolted from the Spa∣niards, and had openly declared against the tyranny o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Alva. This event happened in the year 1572.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, descended from a so∣vereign
family of great lustre and antiquity in Germa∣ny,
inheriting the possessions of a sovereign family in
France, had fixed his residence in the Low Countries;
and on account of his noble birth and immense riches,
as well as of his personal virtues, was universally regard∣ed
as the greatest subject, who lived in those provin∣ces.
He had opposed by all regular and dutiful means
the progress of the Spanish usurpations; and when Al∣va
conducted his army into the Netherlands, and assu∣med
the government, this prince, well acquainted with
the violent character of the man, and the tyrannical
spirit of the court of Madrid, wisely fled from the dan∣ger
which threatened him, and retired to his paternal
estate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to
appear before Alva's tribunal, was condemned in ab∣sence,
was declared a rebel, and his ample possessions
in the Low Countries were confiscated. In revenge,
he levied an army of protestants in the empire, and made
some attempts to restore the Flemings to liberty; but
was still repulsed with loss by the vigilance and military
conduct of Alva, and by the great bravery as well as
discipline, of those veteran Spaniards who served un∣der
that general. The revolt of Holland and Zea∣land,
provinces which the prince of Orange formerly
commanded, and where he was infinitely beloved, cal∣led
him anew from his retreat; and he added conduct,
no less than spirit, to that obstinate resistance, which
was here made to the Spanish dominion. By uniting
the revolted towns into a league, he laid the founda∣tion
of that illustrious commonwealth, the offspring
of industry and liberty, whose arms and policy have
made long so signal a figure in every transaction of Eu∣rope.
He inflamed the inhabitants by every motive,
<PB N="221" REF="242"/>
which religion, resentment, or love of freedom could
inspire. Tho the present greatness of the Spanish mo∣narchy
might deprive them of all courage, he still flat∣tered
them with the concurrence of the other provinces,
and with assistance from the neighbouring states; and
he exhorted them, in defence of their religion, their
liberties, their lives, to endure the utmost extremities
of war. From this spirit proceeded the desperate de∣fence
of Harlem; a defence, which nothing but the
most consuming famine could overcome, and which
the Spaniards revenged by the execution of more than
two thousand of the inhabitants<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, lib. 7.</NOTE>. This extreme se∣verity,
instead of striking terror into the Hollanders,
animated them by despair; and the vigorous resistance
made at Alemaer, where Alva was finally repulsed,
showed them that their insolent enemies were not
wholly invincible. The duke, finding at last the per∣nicious
effects of his violent councils, sollicited to be
recalled from the government: Medina-celi, who was
appointed his successor, refused to accept the charge:
Requesens, commendator of Castile, was sent from
Italy to replace Alva; and this tyrant departed from
the Netherlands in 1574; leaving his name in execra∣tion
to the inhabitants, and boasting in his turn, that,
during the course of five years government, he
had delivered above eighteen thousand of these re∣bellious
heretics into the hands of the executio∣ner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Grotius, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>REQUESENS, tho' a man of milder dispositions, could
not appease the violent hatred, which the revolted
Hollanders had entertained against the Spanish govern∣ment;
and the war continued as obstinate as ever. In
the siege of Leyden, undertaken by the Spaniards, the
Dutch opened the dykes and sluices, in order to drive
them from that enterprize; and the very peasants were
active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather
<PB N="222" REF="243"/>
than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But
notwithstanding this repulse, the governor still pursued
the war; and the contest seemed too unequal between
so mighty a monarchy, and two small provinces, how∣ever
fortified by nature, and however defended by
the desperate resolution of the inhabitants. The prince
of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was resolved to sue
for foreign assistance, and to make applications to one
or other of his great neighbours, Henry or Elizabeth.
The court of France was not exempt from that spi∣rit
of tyrannny and persecution which prevailed
among the Spaniards; and that kingdom, torne by do∣mestic
dissensions, seemed not to enjoy, at present, ei∣ther
leisure or ability to pay regard to foreign interests.
But England, long connected both by commerce and
alliance with the Netherlands, and now more concern∣ed
in the fate of the revolted provinces by a sympathy
in religion, seemed naturally interested in their defence;
and as Elizabeth had justly entertained great jealousy
against Philip, and governed her powerful and opulent
kingdom in perfect tranquillity, great hopes were en∣tertained,
that her policy, her ambition, or her gene∣rosity,
would engage her to support them under their
present calamities. They sent, therefore, a solemn
embassy to London, consisting of St. Aldegonde, Dou∣za,
Nivelle, Buys, and Melsen; and after employing
the most humble supplicationis to the Queen, they pro∣ferred
her the possession and sovereignty of their pro∣vinces,
if she would employ her power in thier de∣fence.</P>
<P>THERE
were many strong motives which might im∣pel
Elizabeth to accept of liberal an offer. She was ap∣prized
of the injuries which Philip had done her, by
his intrigues with the malecontents in England and
Ireland<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Digg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 73.</NOTE>: She was displeased to see a violent and
military government erected in her neighbourhood:
<PB N="223" REF="244"/>
She foresaw the danger which she should incur from a
total prevalence of the catholics in the Low Countries:
And the maritime situation of those provinces, as well
as their command over the great rivers, was a very
inviting circumstance to a nation like the English, who
were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval
power. But this princess, tho' magnanimous, had
never entertained the ambition of making conquests, or
gaining new acquisitions; and the whole purpose of
her vigilant and active politics, was to maintain, by
the most frugal and cautious expedients, the tranquil∣lity
of her own dominions. An open war with the
Spanish monarchy was the apparent consequence of
her accepting the dominion of these provinces; and
after taking the inhabitants under her protection,
she could never afterwards in honour abandon them,
but, however desperate their defence might become,
she must embrace it, even farther than her convenience
or interest would permit. For these reasons, she re∣fused,
in plain terms, the sovereignty profered her;
but told the ambassadors, that, in return for the good-will
which the prince of Orange and the States had
shown her, she would endeavour to mediate an
agreement for them, on the most reasonable conditions
which could be obtained<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 453, 454.</NOTE>. She sent accordingly Sir
Henry Cobham to Philip; and represented to him, the
danger which he would incur of losing all the Low-Countries,
if France could obtain the least interval
from her intestine disorders, and find leisure to offer
her protection to the mutinous and discontented inha∣bitants.
Philip seemed to take this remonstrance in
good part; but no accord ensued, and the war con∣tinued
with the same rage and violence as before.</P>
<P>IT was an accident that delivered the Hollanders
from their present desperate situation. Requesens, the
governor, dying suddenly, the Spanish troops, dis∣contented
<PB N="224" REF="245"/>
for want of pay, and licentious for want
of a proper authority to commend them, broke out
into a furious mutiny; and threw every thing into
confusion. They sacked and pillaged the cities of
Maestricht and Antwerp, and committed great slaugh∣ter
on the inhabitants: They threatned all the other
cities with a like fate: And all the provinces, ex∣cepting
Luxembourg, united for mutual defence
against their violence, and called in the prince of
Orange and the Hollander, as their protectors. A
treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent,
was formed by common agreement; where the re∣moval
of foreign troops, and the restoration of their
ancient liberties, were the objects which the provin∣ces
stipulated to pursue. Don John of Ausfria, natu∣ral
brother to Philip, being appointed governor, found,
on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the States had so
fortified themselves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Spanish troops were
so divided by their situation, that there was no possibi∣lity
of resistance; and he agreed to the terms re∣quired
of him. The Spaniards were recalled; and
these provinces seemed at last to breathe a little from
their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT it was not easy for an entire peace to be settled,
while the thirst of revenge and dominion governed the
King of Spain, and while the Flemings were so
strongly agitated with resentment of past, and fear of
future injuries. The ambition of Don John, who
coveted this great theatre for his military talents, en∣gaged
him rather to enflame than appease the quarrel;
and as he found the States determined to impose very
strict limitations on his authority, he broke all arti∣cles,
seized Namur, and procured the recall of the
Spanish army from Italy. This prince, endowed with
a lofty genius, and animated by the prosperous successes
of his youth, had opened his mind to vast under∣takings;
and looking much beyond the conquest of
<PB N="225" REF="246"/>
the revolted provinces, had projected to marry the
Queen of Scots, and to acquire in her right the domi∣nion
of the British kingdoms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466. Grotius, lib. iii.</NOTE>. Elizabeth was aware
of his intentions; and seeing now, from the union of
all the provinces, a fair prospect of making a long and
vigorous defence against Spain, she no longer scrupled
to embrace the protection of their liberties, which
seemed to be so intimately connected with her own
safety. After sending them a sum of money, about
twenty thousand pounds, for the immediate pay of
their troops, she concluded a treaty with them; in
which she stipulated to assist them with five thousand
foot and a thousand horse, at the charge of the
Flemings; and to lend them a hundred thousand
pounds, on receiving the bonds of some of the most
considerable towns of the Netherlands, for her re∣payment
within the year. It was farther agreed, that
the commander of the English army, should be admit∣ted
into the council of the States; and nothing be
determined concerning war or peace, without previously
informing the Queen or him of it; that they should
enter into no league without her consent; that if
any discord arose among themselves, it should be re∣ferred
to her arbitration; and that, if any prince, on any
pretext, should attempt hostilities against her, they should
send to her assistance an army equal to that which she had
employed in their defence. This alliance was signed
on the 7th of January, 1578<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466.</NOTE>. One considerable in∣ducement
to the Queen for entering into treaty with
the States, was to prevent their throwing themselves
into the arms of France; and she was desirous to make
the King of Spain believe, that it was her sole motive.
She represented to him, by her ambassador, Thomas
Wilkes, that she had hitherto acted religiously the
part of a good neighbour and ally; had refused the
sovereignty of Holland and Zealand, when profered

her; had counselled the prince of Orange to submit
to the King; and had even accompanied her advice
with menaces, in case of his refusal. She persevered,
she said, in the same friendly intentions; and, as a
proof of it, would venture to interpose with her advice
for the composure of the present differences: Let Don
John, whom she could not but regard as her mortal
enemy, be recalled; let some other prince more popu∣lar
be substituted in his place; let the Spanish armies
be withdrawn; let the Flemings be restored to their
ancient liberties and privileges: And if, after these
concessions, they were still obstinate not to return to
their duty, she promised to join her arms to those of
the King of Spain, and force them to a compliance.
Philip dissembled his resentment against the Queen;
and still continued to supply Don John with money
and troops. That prince, tho' once repulsed at Rime∣nant,
by the valour of the English under Norris, and
tho' opposed, as well by the army of the States as by
prince Casimir, who had conducted to the Low Coun∣tries
a great body of Germans, paid by the Queen,
gained a great advantage over the Flemings at Gem∣blours;
but was cut off in the midst of his prosperity
by poison, given him secretly, as was suspected, by
orders from Philip, who dreaded his ambition. The
prince of Parma succeeded to the command, who
uniting valour and clemency, negociation and military
exploits, made great progress against the revolted
Flemings, and advanced the progress of the Spaniards
by his arts as well as by his arms.</P>
<P>DURING these years, while Europe was almost every
where in great commotion, England enjoyed a pro∣found
tranquillity; owing chiefly to the prudence and
vigour of the Queen's administration, and to the wise
precautions which she employed in all her measures.
By supporting the zealous protestants in Scotland, she
had twice given them the superiority over their anta∣gonists,
<PB N="227" REF="250"/>
had connected their interests closely with her
own, and had procured herself entire security from
that quarter, whence the most dangerous invasions
could be made upon her. She saw in France her
enemies, the Guises, tho' extremely powerful, yet
counterballanced by the Hugonots, her zealous parti∣zans;
and even hated by the King, who was jealous
of their restless and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry
of Philip gave her just ground of anxiety; but the
same bigotry had happily excited the most obstinate op∣position
among his own subjects, and had created him
enemies, which his arms and policy were not likely
soon to overcome. The Queen of Scots, her antago∣nist
and rival, and the pretender to her was a
prisoner in her hands; and by her impatience and high
spirit had been engaged in practices which afforded the
Queen a pretence for rendring her consinement more
rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with
her partizans in England. Religion was the capital
point, on which depended all the political transactions
of that age; and the Queen's conduct in this particu∣lar,
making allowance for the prevailing prejudices of
the age, could scarcely be accused of severity or im∣prudence.
She established no inquisition into men's
bosoms; she imposed no oaths of supremacy, except
on those who received trust or emolument from the pub∣lic:
And tho' the exercise of all religion but the esta∣blished
was prohibited, the violation of this law, by
the saying mass, and receiving the sacrament, in private
houses, was, in many instances, connived at<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 459.</NOTE>; while,
at the same time, the catholics, in the beginning of
her reign, shewed little reluctance against going to
church, or frequenting the ordinary duties of public
worship. The pope, sensible that this practice would
by degrees reconcile all his partizans to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>formed
<PB N="228" REF="251"/>
religion, hastened the publication of the bull excom∣municating
the Queen, and freeing her subjects from
all oaths of allegiance; and great pains were taken
by the emissaries of Rome, to render the breach be∣tween
the two religions as wide as possible, and to make
the frequenting protenstant churches appear highly cri∣minal
to the catholics<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Walsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am's Letter in Burnet, vol. II. 418. Cabbala, p. 406.</NOTE>. These practices, with the
rebellions, which ensued, increased the vigilance and
severity of the goverment; but the Romanists, if their
condition was compared with that of the Nonconfor∣mists
in other countries, and with their own practices
where they domineered, could not justly complain
much of violence or persecution. The Queen appeared
rather more anxious to keep a strict hand over the
puritans; who, tho' their pretensions were not so im∣mediately
dangerous to her authority, seemed to be
actuated by a more unreasonable obstinacy, and to re∣tain
claims, of which, both in civil and ecclesiastical
matters, it was, as yet, difficult to discern the full scope
and intention. Some secret attempts of that sect to
establish a separate congregation and discipline, had
been carefully repressed in the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 342. Ibid. Life of Grindal, p. 315.</NOTE>
and when any of the established clergy discovered a ten∣dency
to their principles, by omitting the legal habits
or ceremonies, the Queen had shewn a determined re∣solution
to punish them by fines and deprivations<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 165, 166.</NOTE>;
tho' her orders to that purpose had, by the protection
which these sectaries received from some of the most
considerable courtiers, been frequently eluded. But
what chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her
subjects, was, her frugality, which, tho' carried some∣times
to an extreme, led her not to amass treasures,
but only to prevent impositions upon the people, who
<PB N="229" REF="252"/>
were at that time very little accustomed to bear the
burthens of government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1579.</NOTE> By means of her rigid oeco∣nomy,
she paid all the debts which she found on the
crown, with their full interest; tho' some of these
debts had been contracted even during the reign of her
father<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 245, Camden, p. 446.</NOTE>. She repaid some loans, which she had exacted
at the commencement of her reign; a practice in that
age somewhat unusual<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 246.</NOTE>: And she established her credit
on such a footing, that no sovereign in Europe could
more readily command any sum which the public exi∣gences
might at any time require<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p, 245.</NOTE>. During this peace∣able
and uniform government, England furnishes few
materials for history; and except the small part which
Elizabeth took in foreign transactions, there scarce
passed any occurrence which requries a particular
detail.</P>
<P>THE most memorable event in this period was a
session of Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> summoned on the 8th of Febru∣ary,
1576, where debates were started, which may ap∣pear
somewhat curious and singular. Peter Went∣worth,
a puritan, who had signalized himself in for∣mer
Parliaments, by his free and undaunted spirit,
opened this session with a premeditated harangue,
which drew on him the indignation of the house, and
gave great offence to the Queen and the courtiers. As
it seems to contain the first rude sketch of those prin∣ciples
of liberty which happily gained afterwards the
ascendant in England, it may not be improper to give,
in a few words, the substance of it. He premised,
that the very name of liberty is sweet; but the thing
itself is precious beyond the most inestimable treasure:
And that it behoved them to be careful, lest, con∣tenting
themselves with the sweetness of the name,
they forego the substance, and abandon what of all
earthly possessions was of the highest value to the king∣dom.
He then proceeded to observe, that freedom of
<PB N="230" REF="253"/>
speech in that house, a privilege so useful both to so∣vereign
and subject, had been formerly infringed in
many essential articles, and was, at present, exposed to
the most imminent danger: That it was usual, when
any subject of importance was handled, especially if
it regarded religion, to surmize, that these topics
were disagreeable to the Queen, and that the farther
proceeding in them would draw down her indigna∣tion
upon their temerity: That Solomon had justly
affirmed the King's displeasure to be a messenger of
death; and it was no wonder that men, even tho'
urged by motives of conscience and duty, should be
inclined to stop short, when they found themselves ex∣posed
to so severe a penalty: That by employing this
argument, the house was incapacitated from serving
their country, or even from serving the Queen herself;
whose ears, besieged by pernicious flatterers, were there∣by
rendered inaccessible to the most salutary truths:
That it was a mockery to call an assembly a Parlia∣ment,
and yet deny them that privilege, which was
so essential to their being, and without which they
must degenerate into an abject school of servitude and
dissimulation: That as the Parliament was the great
guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to
discharge their trust, and to maintain that authority
whernce even Kings themselves derive their being:
That a King was constituted such by law, and tho' he
was not dependant on man, yet was he subordinate to
God and the law, and was obliged to make their pre∣scriptions,
not his own will, the rule of his conduct:
That even his commission, as God's vicegerent, en∣forced,
instead of loosening, this obligation; since he
was thereby invested with authority to execute on earth
the will of God, which is nothing but law and justice:
That tho' these surmizes of displeasing the Queen by
their proceedings, had impeached, in a very essential
point, all freedom of speech, a privilege granted them
<PB N="231" REF="254"/>
by a special law; yet was there a more express and
more dangerous invasion made on their liberties, by
frequent messages from the throne: That it had be∣come
a practice, when the house were entering on
any question, either ecclesiastical or civil, to bring an
order from the Queen, inhibiting them absolutely to
treat of such matters, and barring them all farther dis∣cussion
of these momentuous articles: That the pre∣laters,
emboldened by her royal protection, had assum∣ed
a decisive power in all questions of religion, and
required that every one should implicitly submit his
faith to their arbitrary determinations: That the love
which he bore his sovereign, forbad him to be silent
under such abuses, or to sacrifice, on this important oc∣casion,
his duty to servile flattery and complaisance:
And that, as no earthly creature was exempt from
fault, so neither was the Queen herself; but in impos∣ing
this servitude on her faithful commons, had com∣mitted
a great, and even dangerous, fault against her∣self
and the whole realm<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is easy to observe, from this speech, that in these
dawnings of liberty, the parliamentary stile was still
crude and unformed; and that the proper decorum of
attacking ministers and counsellors, without interest∣ing
the honour of the crown, or mentioning the per∣son
of the sovereign, was not as yet entirely establish∣ed.
The commons expressed great displeasure at this
unusual licence: They sequestered Wentworth from
the house, and committed him prisoner to the serjeant
at arms. They even ordered him to be examined by
a committee, consisting of all those members who
were also members of the privy-council, and a report
to be made next day to the house. This committee
met in the Star-chamber, and wearing the aspect of
that arbitrary court, summoned Wentworth to appear
before them, and answer for his behaviour. But tho'
<PB N="232" REF="255"/>
the commons had discovered so little delicacy or pre∣caution,
in thus confounding their own authority with
that of the Star-chamber; Wentworth understood
better the principles of liberty, and refused to give
these counsellors any account of his conduct in Parlia∣ment,
till he was satisfied that they acted not as mem∣bers
of the privy-council, but as a committee of the
house<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 241.</NOTE>. He justified himself by pleading the rigour
and hardship of the Queen's messages; and notwith∣standing
that the committee shewed him, by instances
in other reigns, that the practice of sending such mes∣sages
was not unprecedented, he would not agree to
express any sorrow or repentance. The issue of the
affair was, that, after a month's confinement, the Queen
sent to the commons, informing them, that, from her
special grace and favour, she had restored him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to his liberty and to his palce in the house<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 244.</NOTE>. By this
seeming lenity, she indirectly retained the power
which she had assumed, of imprisoning the members,
and obliging them to answer before her for their con∣duct
in Parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay en∣deavoured
to make the house sensible of her Majesty's
goodness, in so gently remitting the indignation which
she might justly conceive at the temerity of their mem∣ber:
But he informed them, that they had not the li∣berty
of speaking what and of whom they pleased;
and that indiscreet freedoms used in that house, had,
both in the present and foregoing ages, met with a
proper punishment. He warned them, therefore, not
to abuse farther the Queen's clemency; lest she be con∣strained,
contrary to her inclination, to turn an un∣successful
lenity into a necessary severity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of the two houses was, in other re∣spects,
equally tame and submissive. Instead of a bill,
which was at first introduced<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>, for the reformation of
<PB N="233" REF="256"/>
the church, they were contented to present a petition
to her majesty for that purpose: And when she told
them, that she would give orders to her bishops, to
amend all abuses, and if they were negligent, she would
herself, by her supreme power and authority over the
church, give such redress as would entirely satisfy the
nation; the Parliament willingly acquiesced in this so∣vereign
and peremptory decision<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 257.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the commons shewed so little spirit in oppos∣ing
the authority of the crown, they maintained, this
session, their dignity against an incroachment of the
lords, and would not agree to a conference which,
they thought, was desired of them in an irregular man∣ner.
They acknowleged, however, with all humble∣ness,
(such was their expression) the superiority of the
lords: They only refused to give that housse any rea∣son
for their proceedings; and asserted, that where
they altered a bill sent them by the peers, it belonged
to them to desire a conference, not to the upper house
to require it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commons granted an aid of one subsidy and
two fifteenths. Mildmay, in order to satisfy the house
concerning the reasonableness of this grant, entered in∣to
a detail of the Queen's past expences in supporting
the government, and of the increasing charges of the
crown, from the daily increase in the price of all com∣modities.
He did not, however, forget to admonish
them, that they were to regard this detail as the pure
effect of the Queen's condescension, since she was not
bound to yield them any account how she employed
her treasure<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 246.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE greatest and most absolute security which Eli∣zabeth
enjoyed during her whole reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1580.</NOTE> never ex∣empted
her from vigilance and attention; but the scene
began now to be more overcast, and dangers gradually
multiplied on her from more than one quarter.</P>
<P>THE earl of Morton had hitherto retained Scotland
in strict alliance with the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> and had also restored
domestic traquillity: But it was not likely, that the
factitious and legal authority of a regent would long
maintain itself in a country unacquainted with law and
order; where even the natural dominion of hereditary
princes so often met with opposition and controul.
The nobility began anew to break into factions: The
people were disgusted with some instances which ap∣peared
of Morton's avarice: And the clergy, who com∣plained
of farther incroachments on their narrow reve∣nue,
joined and increased the discontent of the other or∣ders.
The regent was sensible of his dangerous situ∣ation;
and having dropt some prevish expressions, as
if he were willing or desirous to resign the government,
the noblemen of the opposite party, favourites of the
young King, laid hold of this concession, and required
that demission which he seemed so frankly to offer
them. James was at this time but eleven years of
age; yet Morton, having secured himself, as he imagi∣ned,
by a general pardon, resigned his authority into
<PB N="235" REF="258"/>
the hands of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLI.</NOTE> who pretended to conduct, in
his own name, the administration of the kingdom.
The regent retired from the government, and seemed
to employ himself entirely in the care of his domestic
affairs; but either tired with this traquillity, which
appeared insipid after the agitations of ambition, or
thinking it time to throw off dissimulation, he return∣ed
again to court, acquired an ascendant in the coun∣cil;
and tho' he resumed not the title of regent, govern∣ed
with the same authority as before. The opposite
party, after holding separate conventions, took to arms,
on pretence of delivering their prince from captivity,
and restoring him to the free exercise of his govern∣ment:
Queen Elizabeth interposed by her ambassador,
Sir Robert Bowes, and mediated an agreement between
the factions: Morton kept possession of the govern∣ment;
but his enemies were numerous and vigilant,
and his authority seemed to become every day more
precarious.</P>
<P>THE count d' Aubigney, of the house of Lenox,
cousin-german to the King's father, had been born
and educated in France; and being a young nobleman
of a good address, and a sweet disposition, he appeared
to the duke of Guise a very proper instrument for de∣taching
James from the English interest, and connect∣ing
him with his mother and her relations. He no
sooner appeared at Stirling, where James resided, than
he acquired the affections of the young monoarch; and
joining his interests with James Stuart of the house of
Ochiltree, a young man of profligate manners, who
had acquired the King's favour, he employed himself,
under the appearance of play and amusement, in instil∣ling
into the tender mind of the prince new senti∣ments
of politics and government. He represented to
him the injustice which had been done Mary in her de∣position,
and made him entertain thoughts, either of

with him in the administration<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 412, 428. Melvil, p. 130.</NOTE>. Elizabeth, alarmed
with the danger which might ensue from the prevalence
of this interest in Scotland, sent anew Sir Robert Bowes
to Stirling; and accusing Aubigney, now created earl
of Lenox, of an attachment to the French, warned
James against entertaining such susicious and danger∣ous
connections<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 309.</NOTE>. The King excused himself, by
Alexander Hume his ambassador; and Lenox, finding
that the Queen had openly declared against him, was
farther confirmed in his intention of overturning the
English interest, and particularly of ruining Morton,
who was regarded as the head of it. That nobleman
was arrested in council, accused as an accomplice in
the late King's murder, committed to prison, brought
to trial, and condemned to suffer as a traitor. He con∣fessed,
that Bothwel had communicated to him the de∣sign,
had pleaded Mary's assent, and had desired his
concurrence; but he denied, that he had ever given his
approbation to that crime; and in excuse for his con∣cealment,
alledged the danger of revealing it, either to
Henry, who had no resolution nor constancy, or to
Mary, who appeared to be an accomplice in the mur∣der<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 314. Crawford, p. 333. Moyse's Memoirs, p. 54.</NOTE>.
Sir Thomas Randolph was sent by the Queen
to intercede in favour of Morton; and that ambassa∣dor,
not content with discharging this duty of his func∣tion,
engaged, by his persuasion, the earls of Argyle,
Montrose, Angus, Marre, and Glencarne, to enter in∣to
a confederacy for protecting, even by force of arms,
the life of the prisoner. The more to overawe that
nobleman's enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be
assembled on the borders of England; but this expe∣dient
served only to hasten his sentence and executi∣on<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 312.</NOTE>.
Morton died with that constancy and resoluti∣on
which had attended him thro' all the various events
of his life; and left a reputation, which was less disput∣ed
<PB N="237" REF="260"/>
with regard to ability than probity and virtue. But
this conclusion of the scene happened not till the sub∣sequent
year.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at this time extremely anxious on
account of every revolution in Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish af∣fairs.</NOTE> because that
country alone, not being separated from England by
sea, and bordering on all the catholic and malecontent
counties, afforded her enemies a safe and easy method
of attacking her; and beacuse she was sensble, that
Mary, thinking herself abandoned by the French mo∣narch,
had been engaged by the Guises to have re∣course
to the powerful protection of Philip, who, tho'
he had not yet come to an open rupture with the Queen,
was every day, both by the injuries which he commit∣ted
and received, more exasperated against her. That
he might retaliate for the assistance which she gave to
his rebels in the Low Countries, he had sent under the
name of the pope<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 359, 370.</NOTE>, a body of seven hundred Spaniards
and Italians into Ireland; where the inhabitants, al∣ways
turbulent, and discontented with the English go∣vernment,
were now more alienated by religious pre∣judices,
and were ready to join every invader. The
Spanish general, San Josepho, built a fort in Kerry;
and being there besieged by the earl of Ormond, presi∣dent
of Munster, who was soon after joined by lord
Gray, the deputy, he made a very weak and cowardly
resistance. After some assaults, feebly sustained, he
surrendered at discretion; and Gray, who was attended
with a very small force, finding himself embarrassed
with so many prisoners, put all the Spaniards and Ita∣lians
to the sword without mercy, and hanged about
fifteen hundred Irish: A cruelty which gave great dis∣pleasure
to Elizabeth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 475. Cox's History of Ireland, p. 368.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the English ambassador made complaints of
this invasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Francis Drake.</NOTE> he was answered by like complaints of
the pyracies committed by Francis Drake, a bold sea∣man,

who had assaulted the Spaniards in the place
where they deemed themselves the most secure, in the
new world. This man, sprung from mean parents in
the county of Devon, having acquired considerable
riches by some depredations made on the Spaniards in
the isthmus of Panama, and having there got a sight of
the Pacific ocean, was so stimulated by ambition and
avarice, that he scrupled not to employ his whole for∣tune
in a new adventure thro' those seas, so much un∣known
at that time to all the European nations<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 8. Stow, p. 689. luy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Voyages, vol. III. p. 730, 748.</NOTE>. By
means of Sir Christopher Hatton, then vice chamber∣lain,
a great favourite of the Queen, he obtained her
consent and approbation; and set sail from Plymouth in
1577, with four ships and a pinnace, on board of which
were 164 able sailors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 478. Hak-P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chas's Pilgrim, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 46.</NOTE>. He passed into the South Sea
by the Straits of Magellan, and falling on the Spaniards,
who expected no enemy in these quarters, he took many
rich prizes, and prepared to return with the immense
booty, which he had acquired. Apprehensive of being
intercepted by the enemy, if he took the same way
homewards, by which he had reached the Pacific
Ocean, he attempted to find a passage by the north of
California; and failing in that enterprize, he set sail
for the East Indies, and returned safely this year by the
Cape of Good Hope. He was the first Englishman
who sailed round the Globe; and the first commander
in chief: For Magellan, whose ship executed the same
adventure, died in his passage. His name became very
celebrated on account of so bold and fortunate an at∣tempt;
but many, apprehending the resentment of the
Spaniards, endeavoured to persuade the Queen, that it
would be more prudent to disown the enterprize, to pu∣nish
Drake, and to restore the treasure. But Elizabeth,
who admired valour, and who was allured by the pro∣spect
<PB N="239" REF="264"/>
of sharing in the riches, determined to countenance
that gallant sailor: She conferred on him the honour of
knighthood, and accepted of a banquet from him at
Deptford, on board the ship which had atchieved so
memorable a voyage. When Philip's ambassador,
Mendoza, exclaimed against Drake's pyracies, she told
him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the
whole new world, and excluding thence all other Eu∣ropean
nations, who should sail thither, even with a
view of exercising the most lawful commerce, very na∣turally
tempted others to make a violent irruption into
these countries<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 480.</NOTE>. To pacify, however, the Spanish
monarch, she caused part of the booty to be restored to
Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be agent
for the merchants, whom Drake had spoiled. Having
learned afterwards, that Philip had seized the money,
and had employed part of it against hereself in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1581.</NOTE>
part of it in the pay of the prince of Parma's troops,
she determined to make no more restitutions.</P>
<P>THERE was another cause, which induced the
Queen to take this resolution: She was in such want
of money, that she was obliged to assemble a Parlia∣ment;
a measure, which as she hereself openly declared,
she never embraced, except when obliged by the ne∣cessity
of her affairs. The Parliament, besides grant∣ing
her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths, enact∣ed
some statutes for the security of the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th January.</NOTE>
chiefly against the attempts of the catholics. Whoever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
in any way, reconciled any one to the church of
Rome, or was himself reconciled, was declared to be
guilty of treason: To say was subjected to the penal∣ty
of a year's imprisonment, and a fine of two hundred
merks; the hearing it was punishable by a year's imprison∣ment
and a fine of an hundred merks: A fine of twenty
<PB N="240" REF="265"/>
pounds a month was imposed on every one who con∣tinued,
during that time, absent from church<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">23 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE>. To
utter slanderous or seditious words against the Queen
was punishable, for the first offence, with the pillory
and loss of ears; the second offence was declared felony:
The writing or printing such words was felony even o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the first offence<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 2.</NOTE>. The puritans prevailed to have
farther application made for reformation in religion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 302.</NOTE>.
Paul Wentworth, brother to the member of that name,
who had distinguished himself in the preceding session,
moved, that the commons, from their own authority,
should appoint a general fast and prayers; and the com∣mons,
rashly assented to his motion. For this presump∣tion,
they were severely reprimanded by a message from
the Queen, as encroaching on the royal prerogative
and supremacy; and they were obliged to submit, and
ask forgiveness<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 284. 285.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen and Parliament were engaged to pass
these severe laws against the catholics, by some late
discoveries, which had been made of the treasonable
practices of the Romish priests. When the worship of
the catholics was suppressed, and the reformation in∣troduced
into the universities, the King of Spain re∣flected,
that as some species of literature was requisite
for the support of these doctrines and controversies, the
Romish communion must totally decay in England,
if no means were found to give erudition to the eccle∣siastics;
and for this reason, he founded a seminary at
Doüay, where the catholics sent their children, chiefly
those intended for the priesthood, in order to receive
the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of
Lorraine imitated this example by erecting a like
seminary in his diocese of Rheims; and tho' Rome
was somewhat distant, the pope would not neglect
to adorn, with a foundation of the same nature,
<PB N="241" REF="266"/>
that capital of orthodoxy. These seminaries, found∣ed
with this hostile intention, sent over every year
a colony or priests, who maintained the catholic
superstition in the full height of its bigotry; and being
educated with a view to the crown of martyrdom,
were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from
maintaining and propagating their principles. They
infused into all their votaries an extreme hatred
against the Queen; whom they treated as an usurper,
a schismatic, a heretic, a persecutor of the orthodox,
and one solemnly and publickly anathematized by the
holy father. Sedition, rebellion, and even sometimes
assassination, were the expedients, by which they pro∣posed
to effectuate their purposes against her; and the
severe restraint, not to say persecution, under which
the catholics laboured, made them the more wil∣lingly
receive, from their ghostly fathers, such violent
doctrines.</P>
<P>THESE seminaries were all of them under the
direction of the jesuits, a new order of regular priests
erected in Europe; when the court of Rome perceived,
that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who sufficed
in times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend
the ramparts of the church, assailed on every side,
and that the inquisitive spirit of the age required a society
more active and more learned, to oppose its dangerous
progress. These men, as they stood foremost in
the contest against the protestants, drew on them the
extreme animosity of that whole sect; and by assum∣ing
a superiority over the other more numerous and
and more antient orders of their own communion,
were even exposed to the envy of their brethren:
So that it is no wonder, if the blame to which their
principles and conduct might be exposed, has, in
many instances, been much exaggerated. This re∣proach,
however, they must bear from posterity, that,
by the very nature of their institution, they were en∣gaged
<PB N="242" REF="267"/>
to pervert learning, the only effectual remedy
against superstition, into a nourishment of that infirmi∣ty;
and as their erudition was chiefly of the ecclesia∣stical
and scholastic kind (tho' a few members have
cultivated polite literature) they were only the more
enabled, by that acquisition, to refine away the
plainest dictates of morality, and to erect a regular
system of casuistry, by which prevarication, perjury,
and every crime, where it served their ghostly purposes,
might be justified and defended.</P>
<P>The jesuits, as devoted servants to the court of
Rome exalted the prerogative of the sovereign pontiff
above all earthly power; and by maintaining his au∣thority
of deposing Kings, set no bounds, either to his
spiritual or temporal jurisdiction. This doctrine became
so prevalent among the zealous catholics in England,
that the excommunication, fulminated against Eliza∣beth,
excited many scruples of a singular kind, to
which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy.
The bull of Pius, in absolving the subjects from their
oaths of allegiance, required them to resist the Queen's
usurpation; and many Romanists were apprehensive,
that, by this clause, they were obliged in conscience,
even tho' no favourable opportunity offered, to rebel
against her, and that no dangers nor difficulties could
free them from this indispensable duty. But Parsons
and Campian, two jesuits, were sent over with a
mitigation and explanation of the doctrine; and they
taught their votaries, that, tho' the bull was for ever
binding on Elizabeth and her partizans, it did not
oblige the catholics to obedience, except when the sove∣reign
pontiff should think proper, by a new summons,
to require it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 477.</NOTE>. Campian was afterwards detected in
treasonable practices; and being put to the rack, and
confessing his guilt, he was publickly executed. His
execution was ordered at the very time, when the duke
<PB N="243" REF="268"/>
of Anjou was in England, and prosecuted with the great∣est
appearance of success his marriage with the Queen;
and this severity was probably intended to appease her
protestant subjects, and to satisfy them, that, whatever
measures she might pursue, she never would depart from
the principles of the reformation.</P>
<P>WHILE hostilities were daily multiplying between
Spain and England, and while Elizabeth knew, that
Philip, from resentment, from bigotry, and from in∣terest,
was strongly, tho' secretly, induced to effect
her ruin, she saw the necessity of securing herself
against the efforts of so powerful and politic a monarch.
The obstinate resistance of the states in the Nether∣lands
gave her hopes, that his force and treasure would
be wasted in subduing these provinces; but the admi∣rable
conduct and rapid progress of the prince of Parma
struck her with apprehensions; and as the acquisition,
which Philip, about this time, made of Portugal,
brought him a great accession of riches and naval power,
the expediency of seeking the protection of some power∣ful
alliance became every day the more apparent. The
animosity, which still encreased between the French
monarch and the duke of Guise, and the confederacy,
which the latter prince had secretly formed with Philip,
opened the prospect of a close alliance between the
sovereigns of France and England; and the general
apprehensions, entertained by all Europe of the Spanish
power, seemed to require some general union for resist∣ing
its farther progress.</P>
<P>THE duke of Alençon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iCatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of marria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with the duke of Anjou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> now created duke of Anjou,
had never entirely dropped his pretensions to espouse
Elizabeth; and that princess, tho' her suitor was near
twenty-five years younger than herself, and had no
knowlege of her person but by pictures or descriptions,
was still pleased with the counterfeit image, which
his addresses afforded her of love and tenderness. The
duke, in order to forward his suit, besides employing
<PB N="244" REF="269"/>
his brother's ambassador, sent over Simier, an agent
of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable conversa∣tion,
who, soon remarking the Queen's humour, amus∣ed
her with gay discourse, and instead of serious poli∣tical
reasonings, which, he found, only awakened
her ambition, and hurt his master's interests, introduced
every moment all the topics of passion and of gal∣lantry.
The pleasure, which she found in this man's
society, soon produced a great familiarity between
them; and amidst the greatest hurry of business, her
wisest ministers had not such ready access to her person,
as had Simier, who, on pretence of negotiation, enter∣tained
her with accounts of the tender attachment
borne her by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Lei∣cester,
who had never before been alarmed with any
courtship made to her, and who always trusted that
her love of dominion would prevail over her inclina∣tion
to marriage, began to apprend, that she was
at last caught in her own snare, and that the artful
encouragement, which she had given to this young
suitor, had unawares engaged her affections. To ren∣der
Simier odious, he availed himself of the credulity
of the times, and spread reports, that that minister
had gained an ascendant over the Queen, not by any
natural principles of her constitution, but by incantati∣ons
and love potions. Simier, in revenge, endea∣voured
to discredit Leicester, and revealed to her a
secret which none of her courtiers dared to discover,
that this nobleman was secretly, without her consent,
married to the widow of the earl of Essex; an action,
which the Queen interpreted either to proceed from
want of respect to her, or as a violation of their
mutual attachment; and which so provoked her,
that she threatned to send him prisoner to the Tower<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>.
The quarrel went so far between Leicester and the
French agent, that the former was suspected of having
<PB N="245" REF="270"/>
employed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away the life
of his enemy; and the Queen thought it necessary,
by proclamation, to take Simier under her own pro∣tection.
It happened, that while the Queen was
rowed in her barge on the Thames, attended by Simier,
and some of her courtiers, a shot was fired which
wounded one of her bargemen; but Elizabeth finding,
upon enquiry, that the piece had been discharged by
accident, gave the person his liberty, without farther
punishment. So far was she from entertaining any sus∣picion
against her people, that she was many times
heard to say, “That she would lend credit to nothing
against them, which parents would not believe of
their own children<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE duke of Anjou, encouraged by the accounts,
which he received of the Queen's prepossessions in his
favour, paid her secretly a visit at Greenwich; and after
some conference with her, the purport of which is not
known, he departed. It appeared, that, tho' his fi∣gure
was not advantageous, he had lost no ground by
being personally known to her; and soon after, she
commanded Burleigh, now treasurer, Sussex, Leicester,
Bedford, Lincoln, Hatton, and secretary Walsingham,
to concert with the French ambassadors the terms of
the intended contract. Henry had sent over on this oc∣casion
a very splendid embassy to England, consisting
of Francis de Bourbon, prince of Dauphiny, and ma∣ny
considerable noblemen; and as the Queen had in a
manner the power of prescribing what terms she pleas∣ed,
the articles were soon settled with the English
commissioners. It was agreed, that the marriage should
be celebrated within six weeks after the ratification of
the articles; that the duke and his retinue should have
the exercise of their religion; that after the marriage
he should bear the title of King, but the administration
should remain solely in the Queen; that their children,
<PB N="246" REF="271"/>
male or female, should succeed to the crown of En∣gland;
that if there be two males, the eldest, in case
of Henry's death without issue, should be King of
France, the younger of England; that if there be but
one male, and he succeed to the crown of France, he
should be obliged to reside in England eight months
every two years; that the laws and customs of England
should be preserved inviolate; and that no foreigner
should be promoted by the duke to any office in En∣gland<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 484.</NOTE>.
These articles, providing for the security of
England, in case of its annexation to the crown of
France, opened but a dismal prospect to the English;
had not the age of the Queen, who was now in her
forty-ninth year, contributed very much to allay their
apprehensions of this nature. The Queen also, as a
proof of her still remaining uncertainty, added a clause,
that she was not bound to compleat the marriage, till
farther articles, which were not specified, shall be
agreed on between the parties, and till the King of
France be certified of their agreement. Soon after the
Queen sent over Walsingham, as ambassador to France,
in order to form closer connexions with Henry, and
enter into a league offensive and defensive against the
encreasing power and dangerous usurpations of Spain.
The French King, who had been extremely disturbed
with the unquiet spirit, the restless ambition, the en∣terprizing,
and yet timid and inconstant disposition of
Anjou, had already sought to free the kingdom from
his intrigues, by opening a scene for his activity in
Flanders; and having allowed him to embrace the pro∣tection
of the states, had secretly supplied him with men
and money for that undertaking. The prospect of set∣tling
him in England was for a like reason very agree∣able
to that monarch; and he was desirous to culti∣vate,
by every expedient, the favourable sentiments,
which Elizabeth seemed to entertain towards them.
<PB N="247" REF="272"/>
But this princess, tho' she had gone farther in her amo∣rous
dalliance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 387, 396, 408, 426.</NOTE> than could be justified or accounted
for by any principles of policy, was not yet determined
to bring matters to a final conclusion; and she con∣fined
Walsingham, in his instructions, to the negotiating
conditions of a mutual alliance between France and
England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 352.</NOTE>. Henry with reluctance submitted to hold
conferences on that subject; but no sooner had Wal∣singham
begun to settle the conditions of alliance, than
he was informed, that the Queen, foreseeing hostility
with Spain to be the result of this confederacy, had
declared, that she would prefer the marriage with the
war, before the war without the marriage<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 375, 391.</NOTE>. The
French court, pleased with this change of resolution,
broke off the conferences concerning the league, and
opened a negotiation for the marriage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 392.</NOTE>. But matters
had not long proceeded in this train, before the Queen
again declared for the league in preference to the mar∣riage,
and ordered Walsingham to renew the conferen∣ces
for that purpose. Before he had leizure to bring
this point to maturity, he was interrupted by a new
change of resolution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408,</NOTE>; and not only the court of France,
but Walsingham himself, Burleigh, and all the wisest
ministers of Elizabeth, were in amaze, doubtful where
this contest between inclination and reason, love and
ambition, would at last terminate.</P>
<P>IN the course of this affair, Elizabeth felt another
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of intentions, from a new contest between her
reason and her ruling passions. The duke of Anjou
expected some assistance of money, by which he might
be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders; and the
Queen herself, tho' her frugality made her long reluc∣tant,
was sensible that this supply was necessary; and
she was at last induced, after much hesitation, to com∣ply
<PB N="248" REF="273"/>
with his request<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 357, 387, 388, 409, 426, 439. Rymer, XV. p. 793.</NOTE>. She sent him a present of an
hundred thousand crowns; by which, joined to his own
demesnes and the assistance of his brother and the Queen
dowager, he levied an army, and took the field against
the prince of Parma. He was successful in raising the
siege of Cambray; and being chosen by the states go∣vernor
of the Netherlands, he put his army into win∣ter
quarters, and came over to England, in order to pro∣secute
his suit to the Queen. The reception, which
he met with, made him lay his account with entire
success, and gave him certain hopes, that Elizabeth
had surmounted all scruples, and was finally deter∣mined
to make choice of him for her husband. In the
midst of the pomp,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th No∣vember.</NOTE> which attended the anniversary of
her coronation, she was seen, after long and intimate
discourse with him, to take a ring from her own finger,
and to put it upon his; and all the spectators conclud∣ed,
that, in this ceremony, she had given him a pro∣mise
of marriage, and was even desirous of signifying
her intention to all the world. St. Aldegonde, ambas∣sador
from the states, dispatched immediately a letter
to his masters, informing them of this great event; and
the inhabitants of Antwerp, who, as well as the other
Flemings, regarded the Queen as a kind of tutelar di∣vinity,
testified their joy by bonefires and the discharge
of their great ordnance<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 486. Thuan. lib. 74.</NOTE>. A puritan of Lincoln's Inn
had wrote a passionate book, which he intituled, “The
Gulph in which England will be swallowed by the
French Marriage.” He was apprehended and prose∣cuted
by order of the Queen, and was condemned to
lose his right hand as a libeller. Such was the con∣stancy
and loyalty of the man, that, immediately after
the sentence was executed, he took off his hat with his
other hand, and waving it over his head, cried “God
save the Queen.”</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding this attachment, which Eliza∣beth
<PB N="249" REF="274"/>
so openly discovered to the duke of Anjou, the
combat of her sentiments was not entirely over; and
her ambition, as well as prudence, rousing itself by in∣tervals,
still filled her breast with doubt and hesitation.
Almost all the courtiers, whom she trusted and favour∣ed,
Leicester, Hatton, and Walsingham, discovered an
extreme aversion to the marriage; and the ladies of her
bed-chamber made no scruple of opposing her resolution
with the most zealous remonstrances<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 486.</NOTE>. Among other
enemies to the match, Sir Philip Sidney, son to Sir
Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland, and nephew to
Leicester; a young man the most accomplished of that
age; used the freedom to write her a letter, in which
he disswaded her from her present resolution, with an
unusual elegance of expression, as well as force of rea∣soning.
He told her, that the security of her govern∣ment
depended entirely on the affections of her protes∣tant
subjects; and she could not, by any measure, more
effectually disgust them than by espousing a prince,
who was son to the perfidious Catherine, brother to the
cruel and perfidious Charles, and who had himself em∣brued
his hands in the blood of the innocent and de∣fenceless
protestants: That the catholics were her mor∣tal
enemies, and believed either that she had originally
usurped the crown, or was now lawfully deposed by
the pope's bull of excommunication; and nothing had
ever so much elevated their hopes as the prospect of
her marriage with the duke of Anjou: That her chief
security at present against the efforts of so numerous,
rich, and united a faction was, that they possessed no
head who could conduct their dangerous enterprizes;
and she herself was rashly supplying that defect, by giv∣ing
an interest in the kingdom to a prince, whose edu∣cation
had zealously attached him to that communion:
That tho' he was a stranger to the royal blood of Eng∣land,
the dispositions of men were now such, that
<PB N="250" REF="275"/>
they preferred the religious to the civil connexions;
and were more influenced by the sympathy of theolo∣gical
opinions than by the principles of legal and here∣ditary
government: That the duke himself had disco∣vered
a very restless and turbulent spirit; and having
often violated his loyalty to his elder brother and his
sovereign, there remained no hopes that he would
passively submit to a woman, whom he might think
himself intitled, in quality of husband, to command:
That the French nation, so populous, so much abound∣ing
in soldiers, so full of nobility, who were devoted
to arms, and, for some time, accustomed to serve for
plunder, would supply him with partizans, dangerous
to a people, unwarlike and defenceless like the gene∣rality
of her subjects: That the plain and honourable
path, which she had followed, of cultivating the affec∣tions
of her people, had hitherto rendered her reign se∣cure
and happy; and however her enemies might seem
to multiply upon her, the same invincible rampart was
still able to protect and defend her: That so long as
the throne of France was filled by Henry or his poste∣rity,
it was in vain to hope that the ties of blood would
ensure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the
maxims of policy or the prejudices of religion; and if
ever the crown devolved to the duke of Anjou, the con∣junction
of France and England would prove a bur∣then,
rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom:
That the example of her sister Mary was sufficient to
instruct her in the danger of such connections; and to
prove, that the affections and confidence of the English
could never be maintained, where they had such rea∣son
to apprehend that their interests would every moment
be sacrificed to those of a foreign and hostile nation:
That notwithstanding these great inconveniences, dis∣covered
by past experience, the house of Bugundy, it
must be confessed, was more popular in the nation than
the family of France; and, what was of chief moment,
<PB N="251" REF="276"/>
Philip was of the same communion with Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1582.</NOTE> and
was connected with her by this great band of interest
and affection: And that however the Queen might re∣main
childless, even tho' old age should grow upon
her, the singular felicity and glory of her reign would
preserve her from contempt; the affections of her sub∣jects,
and those of all the protestants in Europe, would
defend her from attacks; and her own prudence, with∣out
other aid or assistance, would baffle all the efforts
of her most malignant enemies<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Letters of the Sydneys, vol. I. p. 287, and seq. Cabbala, p. 363.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE reflections kept the Queen in great anxiety
and irresolution; and she was observed to pass several
nights without any sleep or repose. At last her settled
habits of prudence and ambition prevailed over her tem∣porary
inclination; and having sent for the duke of
Anjou, she had a long conversation with him in pri∣vate,
where she was supposed to have made him apo∣logies
for the breaking her former engagements. He
expressed great disgust on his leaving her; threw away
the ring which she had given him; and uttered many
curses on the mutability of women, and of islanders<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4 6.</NOTE>.
Soon after he went over to his government of the Ne∣therlands;
lost the confidence of the States by a rash
and violent attempt on their liberties; was expelled
that country; retired into France; and there died.
The Queen, by her timely reflection, saved herself from
the numerous mischiefs which must have attended so
imprudent a marriage: And the present distracted state
of the French monarchy, prevented her from feeling
any effects of that resentment which she had reason to
dread from the affront so wantonly put upon that royal
family.</P>
<P>THE anxiety of the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> from the attempts of the
English catholics, never ceased during the whole course
of her reign; but the variety of revolutions which hap∣pened
<PB N="252" REF="277"/>
in all the neighbouring kingdoms, were the source
sometimes of her hopes, sometimes of her apprehensi∣ons.
This year the affairs of Scotland strongly en∣gaged
her attention. The influence which the earl of
Lenox, and James Stuart, who now assumed the title of
earl of Arran, had acquired over the young King, was
but a slender foundation of authority; while the gene∣rality
of the nobles, and all the preachers, were so
much discontented with their administration. The
assembly of the church appointed a solemn fast; of
which one of the avowed reasons was the danger in
which the King stood from the company of wicked
persons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 319.</NOTE>: And on that day the pulpits resounded with
declamations against Lenox, Arran, and all the King's
present counsellors. When the minds of the people
were sufficiently prepared by these lectures, a conspi∣racy
of the nobility was formed, probably with the
concurrence of Elizabeth, for seizing the person of
James at Ruthven, a seat of the earl of Gowry; and
the design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 August.</NOTE> being kept very secret, succeeded without
any opposition. The leaders in this enterprize were,
the earl of Gowry himself, the earl of Marre, the lords
Lindesey and Boyd, the masters of Glamis and Oli∣phant,
the abbots of Dunfermline, Paisley, and Cam∣buskenneth.
The King wept when he found himself
detained a prisoner; but the master of Glamis said, No
“matter for his tears: Better that boys should weep
than bearded men:” An expression which James
could never afterwards forgive<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 320.</NOTE>. But notwithstanding
his resentment, he found it necessary to submit to the
present necessity. He pretended an entire acquiescence
in the conduct of the associators; acknowleged the de∣tention
of his person to be acceptable service; and
agreed to summon both an assembly of the church and
a convention of estates, in order to ratify that enter∣prize.
The assembly, tho' they had established it as
<PB N="253" REF="278"/>
an inviolable rule, that the King, on no account and on
no occasion, should ever intermeddle in ecclesiastical
matters, made no scruple of taking civil affairs under
their cognizance, and of giving their verdict, that the
attempt of the conspirators was acceptable to all that
feared God, or tendered the preservation of the King's
person, and prosperous state of the realm. They even
enjoined all the clergy to recommend these sentiments
from the pulpit; and they threatned with ecclesiasti∣cal
censures every man who should oppose the autho∣rity
of the confederated lords<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 322.</NOTE>. The convention, be∣ing
composed chiefly of these lords themselves, added
their sanction to these proceedings. Arran was con∣fined
a prisoner to his own house: Lenox, tho' he had
power to resist, yet rather than exite a civil war, or
be the cause of bloodshed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Hist. Presbyter. p. 227. Spotswood.</NOTE>, chose to retire into France,
where he soon after died. He persevered to the last
in his conversion to the protestant religion; which the
Scots clergy would never be persuaded that he had sin∣cerely
embraced. The King sent for his family, re∣stored
his son to his paternal honours and estate, took
care to establish the fortunes of all his other children;
and to his last moments never forgot the early friend∣ship
which he had borne their father: A strong proof of
the good dispositions of that prince<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 328.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No sooner was this revolution known in England,
than the Queen sent Sir Henry Cary, and Sir Robert
Bowes to James, in order to congratulate him on his
deliverance from the pernicious counsels of Lenox and
Arran; to exhort him not to resent the seeming violence
of the lords' enterprize; and to procure from him per∣mission
for the return of the earl of Angus, who, ever
since Morton's fall, had lived in England. They
easily prevailed in the last application; and as James
suspected, that Elizabeth had not been entirely unac∣quainted
<PB N="254" REF="279"/>
with the project of his detention, he thought
proper, before the English ambassadors, to dissemble
his resentment against the confederated noblemen.
Soon after, La Mothe-Fenelon, and Menneville, ap∣peared
as ambassadors from France:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583.</NOTE> Their errand was
to enquire concerning the situation of the King, make
professions of their master's friendship, confirm the an∣cient
league with France, and procure an accommoda∣tion
between him and the Queen of Scots. This last
proposal gave great umbrage to the clergy; and the
assembly had already voted the settling of terms between
the mother and son to be a most wicked undertaking.
The pulpits resounded with declamations against the
French ambassadors; particularly Fenelon, whom they
called the Messenger of the bloody murderer, meaning
the duke of Guise: And as that minister, being knight
of the Holy Ghost, wore a white cross on his shoulder,
they commonly denominated it in contempt, the badge
of Antichrist. The King endeavoured, tho' in vain,
to repress these insolencies; but in order to make the
ambassadors some compensation, he desired the magi∣strates
of Edinburgh to give them a splendid dinner be∣fore
their departure, To prevent this entertainment,
the clergy appointed that very day for a public fast;
and finding that their orders were not regarded, they
employed their sermons in thundering curses on the
magistrates, who, by the King's direction, had put
this mark of respect on the ambassadors. They even
pursued them afterwards with the censures of the
church; and it was with difficulty they were prevent∣ed
from passing the sentence of excommunication
against them, on account of their submission to royal,
preferably to clerical, authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT encreased the alarm with regard to an ac∣commodation
between James and Mary, was, that the
English ambassadors seemed to concur with the French
<PB N="255" REF="280"/>
in this proposal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583.</NOTE> and the clergy were so ignorant as to
credit the sincerity of the professions made by the for∣mer.
The Queen of Scots had often made overtures
to Elizabeth, which had been entirely neglected; but
hearing of James's detention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of Queen Mary to Eliza∣beth.</NOTE> she wrote a letter
in a more pathetic and more spirited strain than
usual; craving the assistance of that princess, both
for her own and her son's liberty. She said,
that the account of her prince's captivity had ex∣cited
her most tender concern; and the experience
which she herself, during so many years, had of the
extreme infelicity attending that situation, had made
her the more apprehensive, lest a like fate should pur∣sue
her unhappy offspring: That the long train of in∣justice
which she had suffered; the calumnies to which
she had been exposed; were so grievous, that, finding
no place for right or truth among men, she was re∣duced
to make her last appeal to heaven, the only com∣petent
tribunal between princes of equal jurisdiction, de∣gree,
and dignity: That after her rebellious subjects
secretly instigated by Elizabeth's ministers, had ex∣pelled
her from the throne, had confined her to pri∣son,
had pursued her with arms, she had voluntarily
thrown herself under the protection of England, fatally
allured by those reiterated professions of amity which
had been made her, and by her confidence in the gene∣rosity
of a friend, an ally, and a kinswoman: That
not contented with debarring her from her presence,
with supporting the usurpers of her throne, with con∣tributing
to the destruction of her faithful subjects,
Elizabeth had reduced her to a worse captivity than
that from which she had escaped, and had made her
this cruel return for the unlimited trust which she had
reposed in her: That tho' her resentment of such severe
usage had never carried her farther than to use some
disappointed efforts for her deliverance, unhappy to
<PB N="254" REF="281"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="255" REF="282"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="256" REF="283"/>
herself, and fatal to others, she found the rigourous of
confinement daily multiplied upon her; and at length
carried to such a height as surpassed the bounds of all
human patience any longer to endure them: That she
was cut off from all communication, not only with the
rest of mankind, but also with her only son; and her
maternal fondness, which was now more enlivened
by their unhappy sympathy in situation, and was her
sole remaining attachment to the world, deprived even
of that melancholy solace, which letters or messages
could give: That the bitterness of her sorrows, still
more than her close confinement, had preyed upon her
health, and had added the insufferable weight of Bodily
infirmity to all those other calamities under which she
laboured: That while the daily experience of her ma∣ladies
opened to her the comfortable prospect of an ap∣proaching
deliverance into a region where pain and
sorrow are no more, her enemies envied her that last
consolation; and having secluded her from every joy
on earth, had done what in them lay to debar her
from all hopes in her future and eternal existence:
That the exercise of her religion was refused her; the
usage of those sacred rites in which she had been edu∣cated;
the commerce with those holy ministers, whom
heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement
of our transgressions, and to seal our penitence by a so∣lemn
re-admission into heavenly favour and forgive∣ness:
That it was in vain to complain of the rigours
of persecution exercised in other kingdoms; when a
Queen, and an innocent woman, was excluded from
an indulgence which neve yet, in the most barbarous
countries, had been denied to the meanest and most cri∣minal
malefactor: That could she ever be induced to
descend from that royal dignity in which Providence
had placed her, or depart from her appeal to Heaven,
there was only one other tribunal to which she would
appeal from all her enemies; to the justice and humani∣ty
<PB N="257" REF="284"/>
of Elizabeth's own breast, and to that lenity, which,
uninfluenced by malignant counsel, she would
naturally be induced to exercise towards her: And
that she finally intreated her, to resume her natural
disposition, and to reflect on the support, as well as
comfort, which she might receive from her son and
herself, if, joining the obligations of gratitude to the
ties of blood, she would deign to raise them from
their present melancholy situation, and reinstate
them in that liberty and authority to which they were
entitled<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was chiefly induced to obstruct Mary's
restoration, because she foresaw an unhappy alternative
attending that event. If this princess recovered any
considerable share of authority in Scotland, her resent∣ment,
ambition, zeal, and connections, both dome∣stic
and foreign, might render her a dangerous neigh∣bour
to England, and enable her, after suppressing
the English party among her subjects, to revive those
pretensions which she had formerly advanced to the
crown, and which her partizans in both kingdoms
still supported with great industry and assurance. If
she was reinstated in power, with such strict limitations
as could not be broken, she might be disgusted with her
situation; and flying abroad, form more desperate
attempts than any sovereign, who had a crown to
hazard, would willingly undertake. Mary herself,
sensible of these difficulties, and convinced by experi∣ence,
that Elizabeth would for ever debar her the
throne, was now become more humble in her wishes;
and as age and infirmities had repressed those senti∣ments
of ambition and indignation, by which she was
formerly so much agitated, she was willing to sacrifice
all her hopes of power and grandeur, in order to
obtain a little more liberty; a blessing to which she
very naturally aspired with the fondest impatience
<PB N="258" REF="285"/>
She proposed, therefore, that she should be associated
with her son in the title to the crown of Scotland,
but that the administration should remain solely in
him: And she was contented to live in England, in
a private station, and even in a kind of restraint; but
with some more liberty, both for exercise and company,
than she had enjoyed since the first discovery of her in∣trigues
with the duke of Norfolk. But Elizabeth,
who was afraid lest such a loose method of guarding
her, would facilitate her escape into France or Spain,
or, at least, would encourage and increase her parti∣zans,
and enable her to conduct those intrigues to
which she had already discovered so strong a propensity,
was secretly determined to deny her requests; and
tho' she feigned to assent to them, she well knew how
to disappoint the expectations of the unhappy princess.
While Lenox maintained his authority in Scotland,
she never gave any reply to all the applications made
to her by the Scottish Queen<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 540.</NOTE>: At present, when her
own creatures had acquired possession of the govern∣ment,
she was resolved to throw the odium of the
refusal upon them; and pretending, that nothing
was required to a perfect accommodation, but the con∣currence
of the council of state in Scotland, she or∣dered
her ambassador, Bowes, to open the negociation
for Mary's liberty, and her association with her son in
the title to the crown. Tho' she seemed to make
this concession to Mary, she refused her the liberty of
sending any ambassador of her own; and that princess
could easily conjecture, from this circumstance, what
would be the result of the pretended negociation. The
Scots council, instigated by the clergy, rejected all
treaty: and James, who was now a captive in their
hands, affirmed, that he had never assented to an
association with his mother, and that the matter had
<PB N="259" REF="286"/>
never gone farther than some loose proposals for that
purpose<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 28. p. 401. from the Cott. Lib. Calig. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Scotland remained not long on the
present footing. James, impatient of restraint, made
his escape from his keepers; and flying to St. Andrews,
sinmmoned his friends and partizans to attend him.
The earls of Argyle, Marshal, Montrose, and Rothes,
hastened to pay their duty to their sovereign; and the
opposite party found themselves unable to resist so pow∣erful
a combination. They were offered a pardon,
upon their submission, and an acknowlegement of
their fault, in seizing the King's person, and restrain∣ing
him from his liberty. Some of them accepted of
the terms: The greater number, particularly Angus,
Hamilton, Marre, Glamis, left the country; and
took shelter in Ireland or England, where they were
protected by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was re∣called
to court; and the malecontents, who could
not brook the authority of Lenox, a man of virtue and
moderation, found, that, by their resistance, they
had thrown all the power into the hands of a person
whose councils were as violent as his manners were
profligate<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 325, 326, &amp; seq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH wrote a letter to James; in which she
quoted a moral sentence from Isocrates, and indirectly
reproached him with inconstancy, and a breach of his
engagements. James, in his reply, justified his mea∣sures;
and turned two passages of Isocrates against
her, for one which she had directed against him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 140, 141. Strype, vol. III. p. 165.</NOTE>.
She next sent Walsingham in an embassy to him; and
her chief purpose in employing that aged minister
on an errand where so little business was to be trans∣acted,
was to learn, from a man of so much penetrati∣on
the discernment, the real character of James.
<PB N="260" REF="287"/>
This young prince possessed very good parts,, tho'
not accompanied with that vigour and industry which
his station required; and as he excelled in general dis∣course
and conversation, Walsingham entertained a
higher idea of his talents than he was afterwards found,
when real business was transacted, to have fully merit∣ed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>48. Jebb, vol. II. p. 536.</NOTE>.
The account which he gave his mistress, in∣duced
her to treat him thenceforth with some more
regard than she had hitherto been inclined to pay
him.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, persevering in his present views,
summoned a Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> where it was enacted, that
no clergyman should presume, in his sermons, to utter
false, untrue, or scandalous saying against the King,
the council, or the public measures, or to meddle,
in an improper manner, with the affairs of his majesty
and the states<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 333.</NOTE>. The clergy, finding that the pulpit
would be no longer a sanctuary for them, were ex∣tremely
offended: They said, that the King was be∣come
popish in his heart; and they gave their adver∣saries
the epithets of gross libertines, belly gods, and
infamous persons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 334.</NOTE>. The violent conduct of Arran soon
brought over the popularity to their side. The earl of
Gowry, tho' pardoned for the late attempt, was com∣mitted
to prison, was tried on some new accusations,
condemned, and executed. Many innocent persons
suffered from the tyranny of this favourite; and the
banished lords, being assisted by Elizabeth, now found
the time favourable for the recovery of their estates and
authority. After they had been foiled in one attempt
upon Stirling, they prevailed in another; and being ad∣mitted
to the King's presence, were pardoned, and re∣stored
to his favour.</P>
<P>ARRAN was degraded from authority; deprived of
that estate and title which he had usurped; and the
<PB N="261" REF="288"/>
whole country seemed to be composed to tranquillity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE>
Elizabeth, after opposing, during some time, the cre∣dit
of this favourite, had found it more expedient,
before his fall, to compose all differences with him,
by the means of Davisson, a minister whom she sent
to Scotland: But having more confidence in the lords,
whom she had helped to restore, she was pleased
with this alteration of affairs; and maintained a good
correspondence with the new court and ministry of
James.</P>
<P>THESE revolutions in Scotland would have been re∣garded
as of small importance to the repose and securi∣ty
of Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracies in England.</NOTE> had her own subjects been entirely
united, and had not the zeal of the catholics, excited
by constraint more properly than persecution, daily
threatened her with some dangerous insurrection. The
vigilance of the ministers, particularly of Burleigh and
Walsingham, was raised in proportion to the activity
of the malecontents; and many arts, which had been
blameable in a more peaceable government, were em∣ployed
to detect conspiracies, and even discover the
secret inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were
wrote in the name of the Queen of Scots, or of the
English exiles, and privately conveyed to the houses of
the catholics: Spies were hired to observe the actions
and discourse of suspected persons: Informers were
countenanced: And tho' the sagacity of these two
great ministers helped them to distinguish the true from
the false intelligence, many calumnies were, no doubt,
hearkened to, and all the subjects, particularly the ca∣tholics,
kept in the utmost anxiety and inquietude.
Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the
earl beheaded some years before, and Philip Howard,
earl of Arundel, son to the unfortunate duke of Nor∣folk,
fell under suspicion; and the latter was, by or∣der
of the council, confined to his own house. Fran∣cis
Throcmorton, a private gentleman, was commit∣ted
<PB N="262" REF="289"/>
to custody, on account of a letter which he had
wrote to the Queen of Scots, and which was intercept∣ed.
Lord Paget, and Charles Arundel, who had been
engaged with him in treasonable designs, immediately
withdrew beyond sea. Throcmorton confessed, that
a plan for an invasion and insurrection had been laid;
and tho', on his trial, he was desirous of retracting
this confession, and imputing it to the fear of torture,
he was found guilty and executed. Mendoza, the
Spanish ambassador, having promoted this conspiracy,
was ordered to depart the kingdom; and Wade was
sent into Spain, to excuse his dismission, and to desire
the King to send another ambassador in his place: But
Philip would not so much as admit the English ambas∣sador
to his presence. Creighton, a Scots Jesuit, co∣ming
over on board a vessel which was seized, tore
some papers, with an intention of throwing them into
the sea; but the wind blowing them back upon the
ship, they were put together, and discovered some dan∣gerous
secrets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camber, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY of these conspiracies were, with great appear∣ance
of reason, imputed to the contrivances of the
Queen of Scots<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 246.</NOTE>; and as her name was employed in all
of them, the council thought, that they could not use
too many precautions against the danger of her claims,
and the restless activity of her temper. She was remov∣ed
from under the care of the earl of Shrewsbury, who,
tho' vigilant and faithful in that trust, had also been
indulgent to his prisoner, particularly with regard to
air and exercise: And she was committed to the custo∣dy
of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; men of
honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and atten∣tion.
An association was also set on foot by the earl of
Leicester and other courtiers; and as Elizabeth was
extremely beloved by the whole nation, except the
more zealous catholics, Men of all ranks willingly
<PB N="263" REF="290"/>
flocked to the subscription of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> The purport of this
association was to defend the Queen, to revenge her
death or any injury committed against her, and to ex∣clude
from the throne all claimants, whatever title
they possessed, by whose suggestion, or for whose behoof;
any violence should be offered to her majesty<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 122, 123.</NOTE>. The
Queen of Scots was sensible, that this association was
levelled against her; and to remove all suspicion from
herself, she also desired leave to subscribe it.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Novem∣ber. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that she might the more discourage
malecontents, by shewing them the concurrence of
the nation in her favour, summoned a new Parliament;
and she met with that dutiful attachment, which she
expected. The association was confirmed by Parlia∣ment;
and a clause was added, by which the Queen
was empowered to name commissioners for the trial of
any pretender to the crown, who should attempt or
imagine any invasion, insurrection, or assassination
against the Queen: Upon condemnation, pronounced
by these commissioners, the person was excluded from
all claim to the succession, and was farther punishable,
as her majesty should direct. And for the greater se∣curity,
a council of regency, in case of the Queen's
violent death, was appointed to govern the kingdom,
to settle the succession, and to take vengeance of that
act of treason<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">27 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SEVERE law was also enacted against jesuits and
popish priests: That they should depart the kingdom
within forty days; that those who should remain be∣yond
that time, or should afterwards return, should
be guilty of high treason; that those who harboured or
relieved them should be guilty of felony; that those
who were educated in seminaries, if they returned not
in six months after notice given, and submitted not
themselves, to the Queen, before a bishop or two
justices, should be guilty of high treason: And that if
<PB N="264" REF="291"/>
any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> so submitting themselves, should, within ten
years, approach the Queen's court, or come within
ten miles of it, their submission should be void<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">27 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. By
this law, the exercise of the catholic religion, which
had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties,
and which was, in many instances, connived at,
was totally suppressed. In the subsequent part of the
Queen's reign, the law was sometimes executed, by the
capital punishment of priests; and tho' the partizans of
that princess asserted, that they were punished for their
treason, not their religion, the apology must only be
understood in this sense, that the law was enacted on
account of the treasonable views and attempts of the
sect, not that every individual, who suffered the penal∣ty
of the law, was convicted of treason<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Some even of those who defend the Queen's measures, allow that in ten years fifty priests were executed, and fifty-five banished. Camden, p. 649</NOTE>. The catho∣lics,
therefore, might now justly complain of a very
violent persecution; which, we may safely affirm, in
spite of the rigid and bigotted maxims of that age, not
to be the best method of converting them, or of re∣conciling
them to the established government and re∣ligion.</P>
<P>THE
Parliament, besides arming the Queen with
these powers, granted her a supply of one subsidy and
two fifteenths. The only circumstance, in which their
proceedings were disagreeable to her, was an applicati∣on,
which the commons made for a farther reformation
in ecclesiastical matters. Yet even in this attempt,
which affected her, as well as them, in a very delicate
point, they discovered how much they were overawed
by her authority. The majority of the house were
puritans, or inclined to that sect<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Besides the petition a ter-mentioned, another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the commons was their passing a bill for the reverend observance of Sunday, which they called the Sabbath, and the depriving the people of those amusements, which they were accustomed to take on that day. D'Ewes, p. 335. It was a strong symptom of a contrary spirit in the upper house, that they proposed to add Wednesday to the fast days, and to prohibit entirely the eating of flesh on that day. D'Ewes, p. 373.</NOTE>; but the severe re∣primands,
<PB N="265" REF="292"/>
which they had already, in former sessions,
met with from the throne, deterred them from intro∣ducing
any bill concerning religion; a proceeding
which would have been interpreted as an incroachment
on the royal prerogative: They were contented to
proceed by way of humble petition, and that not to her
majesty, which would certainly have given some offence,
but to the house of lords, or rather to the bishops,
who had a seat in that house, and from whom alone
they were contented to receive all advances towards
a reformation<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 357.</NOTE>. A strange departure from what we
now apprehend to be the dignity of the commons!</P>
<P>THE commons desired in their humble petition, that
no bishop should exercise his function of ordination but
with the consent and concurrence of six presbyters:
A demand, which as it would have introduced a change
of ecclesiastical government, was firmly rejected by the
prelates. They desired, that no clergyman should be
instituted into any benefice, without previous warning
being given to the parish, that they might examine
whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine:
But this attempt towards a popular model naturally
met with the same fate. In another article of the
petition, they prayed, that the bishops should not insist
upon every ceremony, or deprive incumbents for omit∣ting
part of the service: As if uniformity in public
worship had not been established by law; or as if the
prelates had been endowed with a dispensing power.
They complained of abuses, which prevailed, in de∣nouncing
the sentence of excommunication, and en∣treated
the reverend fathers to think of some law for
the remedy of these abuses: Implying, that those mat∣ters
<PB N="266" REF="293"/>
were too high for the commons of themselves to
meddle with them.</P>
<P>BUT the most material article, which the commons
touched upon in their petition, was the ecclesiastical
commission, and the oath <HI>ex officio,</HI> as it was called,
exacted by that court. This is a subject of such impor∣tance,
as to merit some explanation.</P>
<P>THE first primate after the Queen's accession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ecclesi∣astical court.</NOTE> was
Parker; a man rigid in exacting conformity to the esta∣blished
worship, and in punishing, by fines or depri∣vations,
all the puritans, who attempted to innovate any
thing in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the
church. He died in 1575; and was succeeded by
Grindal, who, as he himself was inclined to the new
sect, was with great difficulty brought to execute the
law against them, or to punish the nonconforming
clergy. He declined obeying the Queen's orders for
the suppression of <HI>prophecyings,</HI> which, she apprehended,
had become so many academies of fanaticism; and for
this offence, she had, by an order of the Star Camber,
sequestered him from his archiepiscopal function,
and confined him to his own house. Upon his death,
which happened in 1583, she determined not to fall
into the same error in her next choice; and she named
Whitgift, a zealous churchman, who had already
signalized his pen in controversy, and who, having
in vain attempted to convince the puritans by argument,
was now resolved to open their eyes by power, and
by the execution of penal statutes. He informed the
Queen, that all the spiritual authority lodged in the
prelates was insignificant without the sanction of the
crown; and as there was no ecclesiastical commission
at that time in force, he engaged her to issue a new
one; more arbitrary than any of the former, and con∣veying
more unlimited authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Neal's History of the Puritans, vol. I. p. 410.</NOTE>. She appointed
forty-four commissioners, twelve of whom were ec∣clesiastics;
<PB N="267" REF="294"/>
three commissioners could exercise the
whole power of the court; their jurisdiction extended
over the whole kingdom, and over all orders of men;
and every circumstance of their authority, and all
their methods of proceeding, were contrary to the
clearest principles of law and natural equity. They
were empowered to visit and reform all errors, heresies,
schisms, in a word, to regulate all opinions, as well
as to punish all breach of uniformity in the exercise of
public worship. They were directed to make en∣quiry,
not only by the legal methods of juries and
witnesses, but by all other means and ways, which they
could devise; that is, by the rack, by torture, by
inquisition, by imprisonment. Where they thought
proper to suspect any person, they might administer to
him an oath, called <HI>ex Officio,</HI> by which he was bound
to answer all questions, and might thereby be obliged
to accuse himself or his most intimate friend. The
fines, which they imposed, were merely discretionary,
and often occasioned the total ruin of the offenders, con∣trary
to the established laws of the kingdom. The
imprisonment, to which they condemned any delin∣quent,
was limited by no rule but their own pleasure.
They assumed a power of imposing on the clergy what
new articles of subscription, and consequently of faith,
they thought proper. Tho' all other spiritual courts
were subject, since the reformation, to inhibitions
from the supreme courts of law, the ecclesiastical com∣missioners
exempted themselves from that legal juris∣diction,
and were liable to no controul. And the more
to enlarge their authority, they were empowered to
punish all incests, adulteries, fornications; all outrages,
misbehaviours, and disorders in marriage: And the
punishments, which they might inflict, were according
to their wisdom, conscience, and discretion. In a
word this court was a real <HI>inquisition;</HI> attended with
all the iniquities, as well as cruelties, inseparable from
<PB N="268" REF="295"/>
that horrid tribunal. And as the juridiction of the
ecclesiastical court was destructive of all law, so its
erection was deemed by many a mere usurpation of
this imperious princess, and had no other foundation
than a clause of a statute, restoring the supremacy to
the crown, and empowering the sovereign to appoint
commissioners for exercising that prerogative. But
prerogative in general, and especially the supremacy,
were supposed in that age to involve powers, which
no law, precedent, or reason could limit and deter∣mine.</P>
<P>But
tho' the commons, in their humble petition
to the prelates, had touched so gently and submissively
on the ecclesiastical grievances, the Queen, in a speech
from the throne at the end of the session, could not
forbear taking notice of their presumption, and reprov∣ing
them for those murmurs, which, for fear of offend∣ing
her, they had pronounced so low as not directly
to reach her royal ears. After giving them some gene∣ral
thanks for their attachment to her, and making
professions of affection to her subjects, she told them,
that whoever found fault with the church threw a slander
upon her, since she was appointed <HI>by God</HI> supreme ruler
over it, and no heresies nor schisms could prevail in
the kingdom but by her permission and negligence:
That some abuses must necessarily have place in every
thing; but she warned the prelates to be watchful;
for if she found them careless of their charge, she was
fully determined to depose them: That she was com∣monly
supposed to have employed herself in many studies,
particularly, philosophical (by which, I suppose, she
meant theological) and she would confess, that few,
whose leisure had not allowed them to make profession
of science, had read or reflected more: That as she
could discern the presumption of many, in curiously
canvassing the scriptures, and starting innovations, she
<PB N="269" REF="296"/>
would no longer endure this licence; but meant to
guide her people, by God's rule, in the just mean be∣tween
the corruptions of Rome and the errors of mo∣dern
sectaries: And that as the Romanists were the in∣veterate
enemies of her person, so the other innovators
were dangerous to all kingly government; and under
colour of preaching the word of God, presumed to
exercise their private judgment, and to censure the
actions of the prince<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 328. This sect had indeed gone so far, that a book of dis-cipline was secretly subscribed by above five hundred clergymen; and the presbyterian government thereby established in the midst of the church, not∣withstanding the rigour of the prelates and of the high commission. So im∣possible is it by penal statutes, however severe, to suppress all religious in∣novation. See Neal's Hist. of the Puritans, Vol. I. p. 483. Strype's Life of Whitgift, p. 291.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM the whole of this transaction, we may observe,
that the commons, in making their general application
to the prelates, as well as in some particular articles
of their petition, showed themselves wholly ignorant,
no less than the Queen, of the principles of liberty and
a legal constitution. And it may not be unworthy of
remark, that Elizabeth, so far from yielding to the
displeasure of the Parliament against the ecclesiastical
commission, granted a new commission before the
end of her reign; in which she enlarged, rather
than restrained, the powers of the commissioners<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom XVI. p. 292, 386, 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this session of Parliament, there was dis∣covered
a conspiracy, which much encreased the general
animosity against the catholics, and still farther widened
the breach between the religious parties. William
Parry, a catholic gentleman, had received the Queen's
pardon for a crime, by which he was exposed to capital
punishment; and having got permission to travel, he
retired to Milan, and made open profession of his re∣ligion,
which he had concealed while he remained
<PB N="270" REF="297"/>
in England. He was here persuaded by Palmio, a
jesuit, that he could not perform a more meritorious
action, than to take away the life of his sovereign and
his benefactors; the nuncio, Campeggio, when con∣sulted,
approved extremely of this pious undertaking;
and Parry, tho' still agitated with doubts, came to
Paris, with an intention of passing over to England,
and executing his bloody purpose. He was here en∣couraged
in the design by Thomas Morgan, a gentle∣man
of great credit in the party; and tho' Watts and
some other catholic priests told him, that the enter∣prize
was criminal and impious, he preferred the au∣thority
of Raggazzoni, the pope's nuncio at Paris, and
determined to persist in his resolution. He here wrote
a letter to the pope, which was conveyed to cardinal
Como; he communicated his intention to the holy
father; and craved his absolution and paternal bene∣diction.
He received an answer from the cardinal, by
which he perceived that his purpose was extremely ap∣plauded;
and he came over to England with a full
design of carrying it into execution. So deeply are
the sentiments of morality engraved in mens breasts,
that it is very difficult even for the prejudices of false
religion totally to efface them; and this bigotted assassin
resolved, before he came to extremity, to try every
other expedient for alleviating the persecutions, under
which the catholics at that time laboured. He found
means of being introduced to the Queen; assured her
that many conspiracies were formed against her; and
exhorted her, as the only means of saving her life,
to give the Romanists some more indulgence in the
exercise of their religion: But lest he should be tempted
by the opportunity to assassinate her, he always came
to court unprovided of every offensive weapon. He
even procured himself to be elected member of Parlia∣ment;
and having made a vehement speech against the
severe laws enacted this last session, was committed to
<PB N="271" REF="298"/>
custody for his freedom, and sequestered from the house.
His failure in these attempts confirmed him the more
in his former resolution, and he communicated his
intentions to Nevil, who entered zealously into the
design, and was determined to have a share in the merits
of its execution. A book, newly published by Dr.
Allen, afterwards created a cardinal, served farther to
efface all their scruples, with regard to the murder of
an heretical prince; and having agreed to shoot the
Queen, while she should be taking the air on horseback,
they resolved, if they could not make their escape, to
sacrifice their lives in fulfilling a duty, so agreeable, as
they imagined, to the will of God, and to true reli∣gion.
But while they were watching an opportuni∣ty
for the execution of their purpose, the earl of West∣moreland
happened to die in exile; and as Nevil was
next heir to that family, he began to entertain hopes,
that, by doing some acceptable service to the Queen,
he might recover the estate and honours which had been
forfeited by the rebellion of the last earl. He betrayed
the whole conspiracy to the ministers; and Parry,
being thrown into prison, confessed the guilt, both to
them, and to the jury who tried him. The letter from
cardinal Como being produced in court, put Parry's
narrative beyond all question, and that criminal,
having received sentence of death<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 103 &amp; seq. Strype, vol. III. p. 255 &amp; seq.</NOTE>, suffered the punish∣ment,
which the law appointed for his treasonable con∣spiracy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">This year, the earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl beheaded some years before, had been engaged in conspiracy with lord Paget for the delivery of the Queen of Scots. He was thrown into the Tower; and being conscious that his guilt could be proved upon him, at least, that sentence would infallibly be pronounced against him, he freed himself from farther prosecution by a voluntary death. He shot himself into the breast with a pistol. About the same time, the earl of Arundel, son to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, having entered into some exceptionable measures, and re∣flecting on the unhappy fate, which had attended his family, endeavoured to depart secretly beyond sea, but was discovered and thrown into the Tower. In 1587 this nobleman was brought to his trial for high treason; chiefly because he had dropped some expressions of affection to the Spaniards and had affirmed that he would have masses said for the success of the armada. His peers found him guilty of treason: This severe sentence was not exe∣cuted; but Arundel never recovered his liberty. He died a prisoner in 1595. He carried his religious austerities so far, that they were believed the im∣mediate cause of his death.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="299"/>
THESE bloody designs now appeared every where,
as the result of that bigotted spirit by which the two
religions, especially the catholic, were at this time actu∣ated.
One Somerville, a gentleman of the county of
Warwic, somewhat, disordered in his understanding,
had heard so much of the merit attending the assassina∣tion
of heretics and persecutors, that he came to Lon∣don
with a view of murdering the Queen; but having
betrayed his design by some extravagances, he was
thrown into prison, and there perished by a voluntary
death<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 495.</NOTE>. About the same time, Baltazar Gerard, a
Burgundian, undertook, and executed the same design
against the prince of Orange;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of the Low Countries.</NOTE> and that great man perish∣ed
at Delft, by the hands of a desperate assassin, who,
with a resolution worthy of a better cause, sacrificed
his own life in order to destroy the famous restorer and
protector of religious liberty. The Flemings, who
regarded that prince as their father, were filled with
infinite regret, as well when they considered the misera∣ble
end of so brave a patriot, as their own forlorn con∣dition,
from the loss of so powerful and prudent a leader,
and from the rapid progress of the Spanish arms. The
prince of Parma had made every year great advances
upon them, had reduced several of the provinces to
obedience, and had laid close frege to Antwerp, the
richest and most populous city of the Netherlands, whose
subjection, it was foreseen, would give a mortal blow
to the already declining affairs of the revolted States.
The only hopes which remained to them, arose from
<PB N="273" REF="300"/>
the prospect of foreign succours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1585.</NOTE>
Being well acquaint∣ed
with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth,
they expected better success in France; and in the
view of engaging Henry to embrace their defence,
they tendered him the sovereignty of their provinces.
But the present condition of that monarchy obliged
the King to reject so advantageous an offer. The
duke of Anjou's death, which, he thought, would
have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and
turbulent prince, plunged him into the deepest distress;
and the King of Navarre, a professed Hugonot, being
next heir to the crown, the duke of Guise took thence
occasion to revive the catholic league, and to urge
Henry, by the most violent expedients, to seek the ex∣clusion
and suppression of that brave and virtuous
prince. Henry himself, tho' a zealous catholic, yet,
because he declined complying with their precipitate
measures, became an object of aversion to the league;
and as his zeal in practising all the superstitious obser∣vances
of the Romish church, was accompanied with
a very licentious conduct in private life, the catholic
faction, in contradiction to the most vulgar experience,
embraced thence the pretext of representing his devoti∣on
as mere hypocrisy, and deceit. Finding his authori∣ty
to decline, he was obliged to declare war against the
Hugonots, and to put arms into the hands of the
League, whom, both on account of their dangerous
pretensions at home, and their close alliance with
Philip, he secretly regarded as his more dangerous ene∣mies.
Constrained by the same policy, he perceived
the danger of associating himself with the revolted pro∣testants
in the Low Countries, and was obliged to re∣nounce
that inviting occasion of revenging himself
for all the hostile intrigues and enterprizes of Philip.</P>
<P>The States, reduced to this extremity, sent over a
solemn embassy to London, and made offer to the
<PB N="274" REF="301"/>
Queen, of acknowleging her for their sovereign, on con∣dition
of obtaining her protection and assistance. Eli∣zabeth's
wisest counsellors were very much divided in
opinion with regard to the conduct which she should
hold in this critical and important emergence. Some
advised her to reject the offer of the States, and repre∣sented
the imminent dangers, as well as injustice, attend∣ing
the acceptance of them. They said, that the sup∣pression
of rebellious subjects was the common cause
of all sovereigns, and the encouragement of a revolt in
the Flemings, might prove the example to a like perni∣cious
practice in the English: That tho' princes were
bound by the laws of the Supreme Being, not to op∣press
their subjects, the people never were entitled to
forget all duty to their sovereign, or transfer, from eve∣ry
fancy or disgust, or even from the justest ground of
complaint, their obedience to any other master: That
the Queen, in the succours hitherto afforded the Fle∣mings,
had considered them as labouring under oppres∣sion,
not as entitled to freedom; and had intended on∣ly
to admonish Philip not to persevere in his tyranny,
without any view of ravishing from him these provin∣ces,
which he enjoyed by hereditary right from his an∣cestors:
That her situation in Ireland, and even in En∣gland,
would afford that powerful monarch sufficient
opportunity of retaliating upon her; and she must hence∣forth
expect, that, instead of secretly fomenting faction,
he would openly employ his whole force in the protec∣tion
and defence of the catholics. That the pope would
undoubtedly unite his spiritual arms to the temporal
ones of Spain; and that the Queen would soon repent
her making so small and precarious an aquisition in fo∣reign
countries, by exposing her own dominions to such
imminent danger<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 507. Bentivoglio, part 2. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="302"/>
OTHER counsellors of Elizabeth maintained a con∣trary
opinion. They asserted, that the Queen had not
even from the beginning of her reign, but certainly
had not at present, the choice, whether she would em∣brace
friendship or hostility with Philip: That by the
whole tenor of that prince's conduct it appeared, that
his sole aims were, the extension of his empire, and the
utter extermination of the protestants, under the spe∣cious
pretence of maintaining the catholic faith: That
the provocations which she had already given him,
joined to his general scheme of policy, would for
ever render him her implacable enemy; and as soon as
he had subdued his revolted subjects, he would undoubt∣edly,
fall, with the whole force of his united empire,
on her defenceless state: That the only question was,
whether she would maintain a war, abroad and support∣ed
by allies, or wait till the subjection of all the con∣federates
of England, should give her enemies leisure
to begin their hostilities in the bowels of that kingdom:
That the revolted provinces, tho' in a declining con∣dition,
possessed still considerable force; and by the
assistance of England, by the advantages of their situa∣tion,
and by their inveterate antipathy to Philip, might
still be enabled to maintain the contest against the Spa∣nish
monarchy: That their maritime power, united to
the Queen's, would give her entire security on that
side from which alone she could be assaulted, and would
even enable her to make inroads on Philip's dominions,
both in Europe and the Indies: That a war which
was necessary, could never be unjust; and self-defence
was concerned, as well in warding certain dangers at a
distance, as in repelling any immediate invasion: And
that since hostility with Spain was the unavoidable
consequence of the present interests and situations
of the two monarchies, it was better to compensate
that danger and loss by the acquisition of such
important provinces to the English empire<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, ibid. Betivoglio, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="303"/>
AMIDST these opposite councils, the Queen, appre∣hensive
of the consequences attending each extreme,
was inclined to steer a middle course; and tho' such
conduct is seldom prudent, she was not, in this resolu∣tion,
guided by any prejudice or affection. She deter∣mined
not to see, without opposition, the total ruin of
the revolted provinces, whose interests she deemed so
closely connected with her own: But foreseeing, that
the acceptance of their sovereignty would engage her
to employ her whole force in their defence, would give
umbrage to her heighbours, and would expose her to the
reproach of ambition aud usurpation, imputations which
she had hitherto carefully avoided, she immediately re∣jected
this offer. She concluded a league with the
States on the following conditions: That she should
send over an army to their assistance, of five thousand
foot and a thousand horse, and pay them during the
war; that the general, and two others, whom she should
appoint, should be admitted into the council of the
States; that neither party should make peace without
the consent of the other; that her expences should be
refunded after the conclusion of the war; and that the
towns of Flushing and the Brille, with the castle of
Rammekins, should, in the mean time, be consigned
into her hands, by way of security.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew that this measure would imme∣diately
engage her in open hostilities with Philip; yet
was she not terrified with the view of the present great∣ness
of that ambitious monarch. The continent of
Spain was at that time rich and populous; and the late
addition of Portugal, besides securing internal tranquilli∣ty,
had annexed an opulent kingdom to Philip's do∣minions,
had made him master of many settlements
in the East-Indies, and of the whole commerce of those
regions, and had mightily increased his naval power,
in which he was before chiefly deficient. All the prin∣ces
of Italy, even the pope and the court of Rome,
<PB N="277" REF="304"/>
were reduced to a kind of subjection under him, and
seemed to possess their sovereignty on very precarious
and uncertain terms. The Austrian branch in Germa∣ny,
with their dependant principalities, was closely con∣nected
with him, and was ready to supply him with
troops for every enterprize. All the treasures of the
West-Indies were in his possession; and the present
scarcity of the precious metals in every country of Eu∣rope,
rendered the influence of his riches the more for∣cible
and extensive. The Netherlands, seemed on the
point of relapsing into servitude; and small hopes were
entertained of their withstanding those numerous and
veteran armies which, under the command of the most
experienced generals, he employed against them. Even
France, which was wont to counterballance the Austri∣an
greatness, had lost all her force from intestine com∣motions;
and as the catholics, the ruling party, were
closely connected with him, he rather expected thence
an augmentation, than a diminution, of his power.
Upon the whole, such prepossessions where every where
entertained concerning the force of the Spanish monar∣chy,
that the King of Sweden, when he heard that
Elizabeth had openly embraced the defence of the re∣volted
Flemings, scrupled not to say, that she had now
taken the diadem from her head, and had adventured
it upon the doubtful chance of war<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 508.</NOTE>. Yet was this
princess rather cautious than enterprizing in her natue∣ral
temper: She ever needed more to be impelled by
the vigour, than restrained by the prudence of her mi∣nisters:
But when she saw an evident necessity, she bra∣ved
danger with magnanimous courage; and trusting
to her own consummate wisdom, and to the affections,
however divided, of her people, she prepared herself
to resist, and even to assault, the whole force of the ca∣tholic
monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="305"/>
THE earl of Leicester was sent over to Holland, at
the head of the English auxiliary forces. He carried
with him a splendid retinue; being accompanied with
the young earl of Essex, his son in-law, the lords Aud∣ley
and North, Sir William Russeil, Sir Thomas Shir∣ley,
Sir Arthur Basset, Sir Walter Waller, Sir Gervase
Clifton, and a select troop of five hundred gentlemen.
He was received, on his arrival at Flushing, by his ne∣phew,
Sir Philip Sidney, the governor; and every
town thro' which he passed, expressed their joy by ac∣clamations,
and triumphal arches, as if his presence,
and the Queen's protection, had brought them the most
certain deliverance. The States, desirous of engaging
Elizabeth still farther in their defence, and knowing the
interest which Leicester possessed with her, conferred
on him the title of governor and captain-general of the
United provinces, appointed a guard to attend him, and
treated him, in some respects, as their sovereign. But
this step had a contrary effect to what they expected.
The Queen was displeased with the artifice of the States,
and the ambition of Leicester. She reprimanded both
of them very severely by letters; and it was with some
difficulty, that, after many humble submissions, they
were able to appease her.</P>
<P>AMERICA was regarded as the chief source of Phi∣lip's
power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostilities with Spain.</NOTE> as well as the most defenceless part of his
dominions; and Elizabeth finding that an open breach
with that monarch was unavoidable, resolved not to
leave him unmolested on that quarter. The great suc∣cess
of the Spaniards and Portugueze in both Indies had
excited a spirit of emulation in England; and as the
success of commerce, still more of planting colonies, is
slow and gradual, it was happy, that a war, in this cri∣tical
age, had opened a more flattering prospect to the
avarice and ambition of the English, and had tempted
them, by the view of sudden and exorbitant profit, to
<PB N="279" REF="306"/>
engage in naval enterprizes. A fleet of twenty sail
was equipped to attack the Spaniard in the West-In∣dies:
Two thousand three hundred volunteers, besides
seamen, engaged on board of it: Sir Francis Drake was
appointed admiral; Christopher Carlisle commander of
the land forces. They took St. Jago, near Cape Verde,
by surprize; and found in it plenty of provisions,
but no riches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1586. January.</NOTE> They sailed to Hispaniola; and easily
making themselves master of St. Domingo by assault,
obliged the inhabitants to ransom their houses by a
sum of money. Carthagena fell next into their hands,
after some more resistance, and was treated in the same
manner. They burned St. Anthony and St. Helens,
two towns on the coast of Florida. Sailing along the
coast of Virginia, they found the small remains of a
colony which had been planted there by Sir Walter
Releigh, and which had gone extremely to decay. This
was the first attempt of the English to form such set∣tlements;
and tho' they have since surpassed all Euro∣pean
nations, both in the situation of their colonies,
and in the noble principles of liberty and industry, on
which they are founded; they had here been so unsuc∣cessful,
that the miserable planters abandoned their set∣tlements,
and prevailed on Drake to carry them with
him to England. He returned with so much riches as
encouraged the volunteers, and with such accounts of
the Spanish weakness in those countries as served ex∣tremely
to inflame the spirits of the nation to future en∣terprizes.
The great mortality which the climate had
produced in his fleet, was, as is usual, but a feeble re∣straint
on the avidity and sanguine hopes of young ad∣ventures<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 509.</NOTE>.
It is thought that Drake's fleet first intro∣duced
the use of tobacco into England.</P>
<P>THE enterprizes of Leicester were much less suc∣cessful
than those of Drake. This man possessed nei∣ther
courage nor capacity, equal to the trusts reposed
<PB N="280" REF="307"/>
in him by the Queen; and as he was the only bad
choice she made for any considerable employment, men
naturally believed, that she had here been influenced
by an affection still more partial than that of friendship.
He gained at first some advantage in an action against
the Spaniards; and threw succours into Grave, by which
that place was enabled to make a vigorous defence:
But the cawardice of the governor, Van Hemert, ren∣dered
all these efforts useless. He capitulated after a
very feeble resistance; and being tried for his conduct,
suffered a capital punishment from the sentence of a
court martial. The prince of Parma next undertook
the siege of Venlo, which was surrendered to him, af∣ter
some resistance. The fate of Nuys was more dis∣mal;
being taken by assault, while the garrison was
treating of a capitulation. Rhimberg, which was gar∣risoned
by twelve hundred English, under the command
of colonel Morgan, was afterwards besieged by the Spa∣niards;
and Leicester, thinking himself too weak to
attempt raising the siege, endeavoured to draw off the
prince of Parma by forming some other enterprize. He
first attacked Doesberg, and succeeded: He then sat
down before Zutphen, which the Spanish general
thought so important a place, that he hastened to its
relief. He made the marquess of Guasto advance with
a convoy, which he intended to throw into the place.
They were favoured by a fog; but falling by chance
on a body of English cavalry, a furious action ensued,
in which the Spaniards were worsted, and the marquess
of Gonzaga an Italian nobleman of great reputation
and family, was slain. The pursuit was stopped by
the advance of the prince of Parma with the main bo∣dy
of the Spanish army; and the English cavalry, on
their return from the field, found their advantage more
than compensated by the loss of Sir Philip Sidney, who,
being mortally wounded in the action, was carried off
by the soldiers, and soon after died. This person is
<PB N="281" REF="308"/>
described by the writers of that age as the most perfect
model of an accomplished gentleman which was ever
formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or
fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite conversation, heroic
valour, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render
him the ornament and delight of the English court;
and as the credit which he possessed with the Queen
and the earl of Leicester, was wholly employed in
the encouragement of genius and literature, his praises
have been transmitted with advantage to posterity. No
person was so low as not to become an object of his hu∣manity.
After this last action, while he was lying on
the field, mangled with wounds, a bottle of water was
brought him to relieve his thirst; but observing a sol∣dier
near him in a like miserable condition, he said,
<HI>This man's necessity is still greater than mine:</HI> And resign∣ed
to him the bottle of water. The King of Scots,
struck with admiration of Sidney's virtue, celebrated
his memory by a copy of Latin verses, which he com∣posed
on occasion of the death of that young hero.</P>
<P>THE English, tho' a long peace had deprived them
of all experience, were strongly possessed of military ge∣nius;
and the advantages gained by the prince of Par∣ma
were not attributed to the superior bravery and dis∣cipline
of the Spaniards, but solely to the misconduct of
Leicester. The States were much discontented with
his management of the war; but still more with his ar∣bitrary
and imperious conduct; and at the end of the
campaign, they applied to him for a redress of all the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
grievances. But Leicester, without giving them any
satisfaction, departed soon after for England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 512. Bentivoglio, part 2. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, while she provoked so powerful an ene∣my
as the King of Spain, was not forgetful to secure
herself on the side of Scotland; and she endeavoured
both to cultivate the friendship and alliance of her kins∣man,
<PB N="282" REF="309"/>
James, and to remove all grounds of quarrel be∣tween
them. An attempt which she had made some
time before, was not well calculated to gain the con∣fidence
of that prince. She dispatched Wotton as her
ambassador to Scotland; but tho' she gave him private
instructions with regard to her affairs, she informed
James, that when she had any political business to
discuss with him, she would employ another minister;
that this man was not fitted for serious negociations;
and that her chief purpose in sending him, was to en∣tertain
the King with witty and facetious conversation,
and to partake without reserve of his pleasures and
amusements. Wotton was master of profound dissi∣mulation,
and knew how to cover, under the appearance
of a careless gaiety, the deepest designs, and most dan∣gerous
artifices. When but a youth of twenty, he had
been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, ambas∣sador
in France during the reign of Mary, to ensnare
the constable, Montmorency; and had not his purpose
been frustrated by pure accident, his cunning had
prevailed over all the caution and experience of that
aged minister. It is no wonder, that, after years had
so much improved him in all arts of deceit, he should
gain an ascendant over a young prince, of so open and
unguarded a temper as James, especially when the
Queen's recommendation prepared the way for his ar∣tifices.
He was admitted into all the pleasures of the
King; made himself master of his secrets; and had so
much the more authority with him in political trans∣actions,
as he did not seem to pay the least attention
or regard to these matters. The Scots ministers,
who observed the growing interest of this man,
endeavoured to acquire his friendship; and scrupled
not to sacrifice to his intrigues the most essen∣tial
interests of their master. Elizabeth's usual jea∣lousies
<PB N="283" REF="310"/>
with regard to her heirs began now to be level∣led
against James; and as that prince had attained the
years proper for marriage, she was apprehensive, lest,
by being strengthened with children and alliances, he
should acquire the greater interest and authority with
her English subjects. She directed Wotton to form a
secret concert with some Scots noblemen, and to pro∣cure
their promise, that James, during three years,
should not, on any account, be permitted to marry.
In consequence of this view, they endeavoured to
embroil him with the King of Denmark, who had sent
ambassadors to Scotland, on pretence of demanding the
restitution of the Orkneys, but really with a view of
opening a proposal of marriage between James and his
daughter. Wotton is said to have employed his in∣trigues
to purposes still more dangerous. He formed
a conspiracy with some malecontents, to seize the per∣son
of the King, and to deliver him into the hands of
Elizabeth, who would probably have denied all con∣currence
in the design, but who would have been care∣ful
to retain him in perpetual thraldom, if not capti∣vity.
The conspiracy was discovered, and Wotton fled
hastily from Scotland, without taking leave of the
King<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Melvil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JAMES'S situation obliged him to dissemble his re∣sentment
of this traiterous attempt, and his natural
temper inclined him soon to forgive and forget it. The
Queen found no difficulty to renew the negotiations
for a strict alliance between Scotland and England;
and the more effectually to gain the prince's affections,
she granted him a pension, equivalent to his claim on
the inheritance of his grandmother the countess of
Lenox, lately deceased<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 351.</NOTE>. A league was formed be∣tween
Elizabeth and James, for the mutual defence of
their dominions, and of their religion, now menaced
<PB N="284" REF="311"/>
by the open combination of all the catholic powers
of Europe. It was stipulated, that if Elizabeth was
invaded, James should aid her with a body of two
thousand horse and five thousand foot; that Elizabeth,
in a like case, should send to his assistance three thou∣sand
horse and six thousand foot; that the charge
of these armies should be defrayed by the prince who
demanded assistance; that if the invasion should be
made upon England, within sixty miles of the fron∣tiers
of Scotland, this latter kingdom should march
its whole force to the assistance of the former; and that
the present league should supersede all former alliances
of either state with any foreign kingdom, so far as re∣ligion
was concerned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 349. Camden, p. 513. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 803.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this league James secured himself against all at∣tempts
from abroad, opened a way for acquiring the
confidence and affection of the English, and might en∣tertain
some prospect of domestic tranquillity, which,
so long as he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he
could never expect long to enjoy. Besides the tur∣bulent
disposition, and inveterate feuds of the nobi∣lity,
ancient maladies of the Scots government, the
spirit of fanaticism had introduced a new disorder; so
much the more dangerous, as religion, when corrupted
by false opinion, is not restrained by any rules of mo∣rality,
and is even scarcely to be accounted for in its
operations, by any principles of ordinary conduct and
policy. The insolence of the Scots preachers, who
triumphed in their dominion over the populace, had,
at this time, reached an extreme height; and they
carried their arrogance so far, not only against the
King, but against the Parliament, and the whole civil
power, that they dared to excommunicate the archbi∣shop
of St. Andrews, because he had been active for
promoting a law which restrained their seditious ser∣mons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 345, 346.</NOTE>:
<PB N="285" REF="312"/>
Nor could that prelate save himself any way
from this terrible sentence, but by renouncing all pre∣tensions
to ecclesiastical authority. One Gibson said
in the pulpit, that captain James Stuart (meaning the
late earl of Arran) and his wife, Jezabel, had been
deemed the chief persecutors of the church; but it was
now seen, that the King himself was the great offender:
And for this crime the preacher denounced against him,
the curse which fell on Jeroboam, that he should die
childless, and be the last of his race<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE secretary, perceiving the King so much mo∣lested
with ecclesiastical affairs, and with the refractory
disposition of the clergy, advised him to leave them to
their own courses: For that in a short time they would
become so intolerable, that the people would rise
against them, and chace them out of the country.
“True,” replied the King: “If I purposed to undo
the church and religion, your counsel were good:
But my intention is to maintain both; therefore
cannot I suffer the clergy to follow such a conduct,
as will in the end bring religion into contempt<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 348.</NOTE>.”

<P>THE dangers which arose from the character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLII.</NOTE> prin∣ciples,
and pretensions of the Queen of Scots, had
engaged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1586.</NOTE> very early, Elizabeth to consult, in her
treatment of that unfortunate princess, the dictates of
jealousy and politics, rather than of friendship or gene∣rosity:
Resentment of this usage had pushed Mary into
enterprizes, which had very nearly threatned the re∣pose
and authority of Elizabeth: The rigour and re∣straint,
which were thence redoubled upon the captive
Queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p. 607.</NOTE>, still impelled her to attempt greater ex∣tremities;
and while her impatience of confinement,
her revenge<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mary's extreme animosity against Elizabeth may easily be conceived, and broke out, about this time, in an incident, which may appear curious. While the former Queen was kept in custody by the earl of Shrewsbury, she lived during a long time in great intimacy with the countess; but that lady ente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aining jealousy of an armour between her and the earl, their friendship was converted into enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which as once gratified her spite against the countess and that against Eli∣zabeth. She wrote to the Queen informing her of all the malicious scan∣dalous stories, which, she said, the countess of Shrewsbury had reported of her: That Elizabeth had given a promise of marriage to a certain per∣son, whom she afterwards often admitted to her bed: That she had been equally indulgent to Simier, the French agent, and to the duke of Anjou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: That Hatton was also one of her paramours, who was even disgusted with her excessive love and fondness: That tho' she was on other occasions avaritious to the last degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, she spared no expence in gratifying her amorous passions: That notwith∣standing her licentious amours, she was not made like other women; and all those who courted her marriage would in the end be disappointed: That she was so conceited of her beauty, as to swallow the most extrava∣gant flattery from her courtiers, who could not, on these occasions, for∣bear even sneering at her for her folly: That it was usual for them to tell her, that the lustre of her beauty dazled them like that of the sun, and they could not behold it with a fixed eye: She added, that the countess had said, that Mary's best policy would be to engage her son to make love to the Queen; nor was there any danger that such a proposal would be taken for mockery; so ridiculous was the opinion which she had enter∣tained of her own charms. She pretended, that the countess had repre∣sented her as no less odious in her temper than profligate in her manners, and absurd in her vanity: That she had so beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady's finger; and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended, that the accident had proceeded from the the fall of a candlestick: That she had cut another across the hand with a knife, who had been so unfortunate as to offend her. Mary added, that the countess had informed her, that Elizabeth had subordned Rolstone to pretend friendship to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby throw in∣famy on her rival. See Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a very little before the detection of Queen Mary's conspiracy; and contributed, no doubt, to render the proceedings against her more rigorous. How far all these imputations against Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear doubtful: But her extreme fondness for Leicester, Hatton, and Essex, not to mention Moun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joy and others, with the curious passages between her and admiral Seymour, contained in Haynes, render her chastity very suspicious. Her self-conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other undoubted authority, to have been extravagant. Even when she was a very old woman, she allowed her courtiers to flatter her with regard to her <HI>excellent beauties.</HI> Birch, vol. II. p. 442, 443. Her passionate temper may also be proved from many lively instances; and it was not unusual with her to beat her maids of honour. See the Sydney Papers, vol. II. p. 38. The blow she gave to Essex before the privy council is another instance. Had this Queen been born in a private station, she would not have been very amiable: But her absolute authority, at the same time that it gave an uncontroled swing to her violent passions, enabled her to compensate for her infirmities by many great and signal virtues.</NOTE>, and her high spirit concurred with re∣ligious
<PB N="287" REF="316"/>
zeal, and the suggestions of desperate bigots,
she was at last engaged in designs, which afforded
her enemies, who waited for the opportunity, a pretence
or reason for effectuating her final ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="317"/>
THE English seminary at Rheims had wrought them∣selves
up to a high pitch of rage and animosity against
the Queen. The recent persecutions, from which they
had escaped:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the catholics.</NOTE> The new rigours, which, they knew,
awaited them in the course of their missions: The li∣berty
which for the present they enjoyed of declaiming
against that princess: And the contagion of religious
fury, which every where surrounded them in France:
All these causes had obliterated with them every max∣im
of common sense, and every principle of morals or
humanity. Intoxicated with admiration of the omni∣potence
and infallibilit, of the pope, they revered his
bull by which he excommunicated and deposed the
Queen; and some of them had gone to that height of
extravagance, as to assert, that that performance had
been immediately dictated by the Holy Ghost. The
assassination of heretical sovereigns, and of that princess in
particular, was represented as the most meritorious of all
enterprizes; and they taught, that whoever perished in
such pious attempts enjoyed without dispute the glorious
and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By such doc∣trines,
they instigated John Savage, a man of desperate
courage, who had served some years in the Low Coun∣tries,
under the prince of Parma, to attempt the life of
Elizabeth; and this assassin, having made a vow to per∣severe
in his design, was sent over to England, and
recommended to the confidence of the more zealous
catholics.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="318"/>
ABOUT the same time, John Ballard, a priest of that
seminary, had returned to Paris from his mission in
England and Scotland; and as he had discovered a
spirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent
among the catholic devotees in these countries, he had
founded on that disposition the project of dethroning
Elizabeth, and of restoring by force of arms the exercise
of the antient religion in England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Murden's State Papers, p. 517.</NOTE>. The situation
of affairs abroad seemed favourable to this enterprize:
The pope, the Spaniard, the duke of Guise, the prince,
created by the pope duke, of Parma, concurring in in∣terests,
had formed a resolution to make some attempt
upon the Queen: And Mendoza, the Spanish ambas∣sador
at Paris, strongly encouraged Ballard to hope
for succours from these princes. Charles Paget alone,
a zealous catholic and a devoted partizan of the Queen
of Scots, being well acquainted with the prudence,
vigour, and general popularity of Elizabeth, always
maintained, that so long as that princess was allowed
to live, it was in vain to expect any success from an
enterprize upon England. Ballard, persuaded of this
truth, saw more clearly the necessity of executing the
design, formed at Rheims: He came over to England
in the disguise of a soldier, and assumed the name of
captain fortescue: And he bent his endeavours to
effectuate at once the project of an assassination, an in∣surrection
and an invasion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 515.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first person, to whom he addressed himself, was
Anthony Babington of Dethic in the county of Derby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Babington's conspiracy.</NOTE>
This young gentleman was of a good family, possessed
a plentiful fortune, had discovered an excellent capa∣city,
and was accomplished in literature beyond most
of his years or station. Being zealously devoted to the
catholic communion, he had secretly made a journey
to Paris some time before; and had fallen into intimacy
with Thomas Moragn, a bigotted fugitive from Eng∣gland,
<PB N="290" REF="319"/>
and with the bishop of Glasgow, Mary's am∣bassador
to the court of France. By continually
extolling the amiable accomplishments and hero∣ical
virtues of that princess, they inflamed the
unguarded mind of young Babington to make
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me attempt for her service; and they employed
every principle of ambition, gallantry, and religious
zeal to give him a contempt of those dangers, which
attended any enterprize against the vigilant govern∣ment
of Elizabeth. Finding him well disposed for
their purpose, they sent him back to England, and
secretly, unknown to himself, recommended him to
the Queen of Scots as a person worth engaging in her
service. She wrote him a letter, full of friendship and
confidence; and Babington, sanguine in his temper
and zealousin his principles, thought, that these advan∣ces
now bound him in honour to devote himself entire∣ly
to the service of that unfortunate princes. During
some time, he had found means of conveying to her
all her foreign correspondence; but after she was put
under the custody of Sir Amias Paulet, and reduced
to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced so
much difficulty and danger in rendering her this service,
that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature.</P>
<P>WHEN Ballard began to open his intentions to
Babington, he found his zeal suspended, not extin∣guished:
His former ardour revived on the mention of
any enterprize, which seemed to promise success in the
cause of Mary or of the catholic religion. He had
entertained sentiments conformable to those of Paget,
and represented the folly of all attempts, which, during
the life-time of Elizabeth, could be formed against
the established religion and government of England.
Ballard, encouraged by this hint, proceeded to dis∣cover
to him the design undertaken by Savage<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. State Trials, p. 114.</NOTE>;
and was pleased to observe, that, instead of being
shocked with that project, Babington only thought it not
<PB N="291" REF="320"/>
secure enough, when entrusted to one single hand, and
proposed to join four others with Savage in this despe∣rate
and bloody enterprize.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of these views, Babington employed
himself in encreasing then umber of his associates; and he
secretly drew into the conspiracy many catholic gen∣tlemen,
discontented with the present government.
Barnwel, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc,
a gentleman of Lancashire, and Abbington, whose
father had been cofferer to the houshould, readily un∣dertook
the assassination of the Queen. Charles Tilney
the heir of a very antient family, and Titchborne
of Southampton, when the design was proposed to
them, expressed some scruples, which were at last re∣moved
by the arguments of Babington and Ballard.
Savage alone refused for some time to share the
glory of the enterprize with any others<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>; he chal∣lenged
the whole to himself; and it was with some
difficulty he was induced to depart from this preposte∣rous
ambition.</P>
<P>THE delivery of the Queen of Scots, at the very
same instant, when Elizabeth should be assassinated,
was requisite for effecting the purpose of the conspirators;
and Babington undertook, with a party of an hundred
horse, to attack her guards, while she should be taking
the air on horseback. In this enterprize, he engaged
Edward Windsor, brother to the lord of that name,
Thomas Salisbury, Robert Gage, John Travers, John
Jones, and Henry Donne; most of them men of family
and interest. The conspirators much wanted, but
could not find, any nobleman of name, whom they
might place at the head of their enterprize; but they
trusted, that the great events, of the Queen's death
and Mary's delivery, would rouze all the zealous
catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking
advantage of the general confusion, would easily fix
<PB N="292" REF="321"/>
the Queen of Scots on the throne, and re-establish the
antient religion.</P>
<P>THESE desperate projects had not escaped the vigi∣lance
of Elizabeth's council, particularly of Walsing∣ham,
secretary of state. That artful minister had en∣gaged
Maud, a catholic priest, whom he retained in
pay, to attend Ballard in his journey to France, and
had thereby got a hint of the designs, entertained by
the fugitives. Polly, another of his spies, had found
means to insinuate himself among the conspirators
in England; and tho' not entirely trusted, had obtained
some insight into their dangerous secrets. But the bot∣tom
of the conspiracy was never fully known, till
Gifford, a seminary priest, came over, and made a
tender of his service to Walsingham. By his means,
the discovery became of the utmost importance, and
involved the fate of Mary, as well as of those zealous
partizans of that princess.</P>
<P>BABINGTON and his associates, having laid such
a scheme, as, they thought, promised infallible success,
were impatient to communicate the design to the
Queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation and
concurrence. For this service, they employed Gifford,
who immediately applied to Walsingham, that the in∣terest
of that minister might forward his secret correspon∣dence
with Mary. Walsingham proposed the matter
to Paulet, and desired him to connive at Gifford's cor∣rupting
one of his servants: But Paulet was averse to
the introducing such a pernicious precedent into his
family, and desired, that they would rather think of
some other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who
supplied the family with ale; and bribed him to con∣vey
letters to the captive Queen. The letters,
by Paulet's connivance, were thrust thro' a chink in
the wall; and answers were returned by the same con∣veyance.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="322"/>
BALLARD and Babington were at first diffident of
Gifford's fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave
him only blank papers made up like letters: But find∣ing
by the answers, that these had been faithfully deli∣vered,
they laid aside all farther scruple, and conveyed
by his hands the most criminal and dangerous parts
of their conspiracy. Babington informed Mary of the
design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an in∣surrection
at home, the scheme for her delivery, and
the conspiracy for assassinating the usurper, by six noble
gentlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private
friends, who, from the zeal, which they bore to the
catholic cause and her majesty's service, would un∣dertake
the <HI>tragical execution.</HI> Mary replied, that she
approved highly of the design, that the gentlemen might
expect all the rewards, which it should ever be in her
power to confer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary assents to the con∣spiracy.</NOTE> and that the death of Elizabeth was
a necessary circumstance, before any attempts were
made either for her own delivery or an insurrection<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 135. Camden, p. 515.</NOTE>.
These letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget,
the archbishop of Glasgow, and Sir Francis Ingel∣field,
were carrield by Gifford to secretary Walsing∣ham;
were decyphered by the art of Philips, his clerk;
and copies taken of them. Walsingliam employed a
new artifice, in order to obtain full insight into the
plot: He subjoined to a letter of Mary's a postscript
in the same cypher; in which he made her desire
Babington to inform her of the names of the six con∣spirators.
The indiscretion of Babington furnished
Walsingham with still another means of detection as
well as of defence. That gentleman had made a picture
be drawn, where he himself was represented standing
amidst the six assassins; and a motto was subjoined,
expressing, that their common perils were the band
of their confederacy. A copy of this picture was
brought to Elizabeth, that she might know the assassin
<PB N="294" REF="323"/>
and guard herself against their approach to her per∣son.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Babington, anxious to ensure and
hasten the foreign succours, resolved to dispatch Bal∣lard
into France; and he procured for him, under
a feigned name, a licence to travel. In order to re∣move
from himself all suspicion, he applied to Wal∣singham,
pretended great zeal for the Queen's service,
offered to go abroad, and promised to employ that
confidence, which he had gained among the catholics,
to the detection and disappointment of their con∣spiracies.
Walsingham commended his loyal purposes;
and promising his own council and assistance in the
execution of them, still fed him with hopes, and
maintained a close correspondence with him. A war∣rant,
meanwhile, was issued for seizing Ballard; and
this incident joined to the consciousness of guilt, begot
in all the conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern.
Some advised that they should immediately make their
escape: Others proposed, that Savage and Charnoc
should without delay execute their purpose against
Elizabeth; and Babington, in prosecution of this
scheme, furnished Savage with money, that he might
buy good cloaths, and have thereby the more easy ac∣cess
to the Queen's person. Next day, they began to
apprehend, that they had taken the alarm too hastily;
and Babington, having renewed his correspondence
with Walsingham, was persuaded by that subtle mini∣ster,
that the seizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely
from the usual diligence of informers in the detection
of popish and seminary priests. He even consented to
take secretly lodgings in Walsingham's house, that they
might have more frequent conferences together, before
his intended departure for France: But observing, that
he was watched and guarded, he made his espcape,
and gave the alarm to the other conspirators. They
all took to flight, covered themselves with several dis∣guises,
<PB N="295" REF="324"/>
and lay concealed in woods or barns; but
were soon discovered and thrown into prison. In their
examinations, they contradicted each other; and the
leaders were obliged to make a full confession of the
truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspi∣rators seized and execut∣ed.</NOTE> Fourteen were condemned and executed: Of
whom, seven acknowleged the crime on their trial; the
rest were convicted by evidence.</P>
<P>THE lesser conspirators being dispatched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> measures
were taken for the trial and conviction of the Queen
of Scots; on whose account, and by whose concur∣rence,
all these attempts had been made against the
life of the Queen, and the tranquillity of the kingdom.
Some of Elizabeth's counsellors were averse to this
procedure; and thought, that the close confinement
of a woman, who was become very sickly, and who
would probably put a speedy end to their anxiety by
her natural death, might give sufficient security to the
government, without attempting a measure of which
there scarcely remains any example in history. Lei∣cester
advised, that Mary should be secretly dispatched
by poison; and he sent a divine to convince Walsingham
of the lawfulness of that action: But Walsingham decla∣red
his abhorrence of it; and insisted still, in conjunction
with the majority of the counsellors, for the open trial
of the Queen of Scots. The situation of England,
and of the English ministers had, indeed, been hitherto
not a little dangerous. No successor of the crown was
declared; but the heir of blood, to whom the people
in general were likely to adhere, was, by education,
an enemy to the national religion; was, from mul∣tiplied
injuries, an enemy to the ministers and princi∣pal
nobility: And their personal safety, as well as the
security of the government, seemed to hang alone on
the Queen's life, who was now somewhat advanced in
years. No wonder, therefore, that Elizabeth's coun∣sellors
knowing themselves to be so obnoxious to the
Queen of Scots, endeavoured to push every measure to
<PB N="296" REF="325"/>
extremity against her; and were even more anxious
than the Queen herself, to prevent her from ever mount∣ing
the throne of England.</P>
<P>THO' all England was acquainted with the detec∣tion
of Babington's conspiracy, every avenue to the
Queen of Scots was so strictly guarded, that she re∣mained
in utter ignorance of the whole matter; and it
was a great surprize to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges,
by Elizabeth's orders, informed her, that all her ac∣complices
were discovered and arrested. He chose the
time for giving her this intelligence, when she was
mounted on horseback to go a hunting; and she was
not permitted to return to her former place of abode,
but was conducted from one gentleman's house to
another, till she was lodged in Fotheringay castle in
the country of Northampton, which it was determined
to make the last stage of her trial and sufferings. Her
two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a
Scot, were immediately arrested: All her papers were
seized, and sent up to the council: Above sixty differ∣ent
keys to cyphers were discovered: There were
also found many letters from persons beyond sea; and
several too from English noblemen, containing ex∣pressions
of respect and attachment. The Queen took
no notice of this last discovery; but the persons them∣selves,
knowing their correspondence to be detected,
thought that they had no other method of making
atonement for their imprudence, than declaring them∣selves
thenceforth the most inveterate enemies to the
Queen of Scots<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was resolved to try Mary not by the common
statutes of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolution to try the Queen of Scots.</NOTE> but by the act which had passed
the former year, with a view to this very event;
and the Queen, in terms of that act, appointed a
commission, consisting of forty noblemen and privy∣counsellors,
and empowered them to examine and pass
<PB N="297" REF="326"/>
sentence on Mary, whom she denominated the late
Queen of Scots, and heir to James the fifth of Scot∣land.
The commissioners came to Fotheringay castle,
and sent to her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet,
and Edward Barker, who delivered her a letter
from Elizabeth informing her of the commis∣sion,
and of the approaching trial. Mary receiv∣ed
the intelligence without any emotion or astonish∣ment.
She said, however, that it seemed strange to
her that the Queen should command her, as a subject,
to submit to a trial and examination before subjects:
That she was an absolute independant princess, and
would yield to nothing which might derogate either
from her royal majesty, from the state of sovereign
princes, or from the dignity and rank of her son:
That, however oppressed by misfortunes and calami∣ties,
her spirits were not yet so much broke, as her
enemies flattered themselves; nor would she, on any
account, be accessary to her own degradation and
dishonour: That she was ignorant of the laws and
statutes of England; was utterly destitute of council;
and could not conceive who were intitled to be called
her peers, or could legally sit as judges on her trial:
That tho' she had lived in England for many years,
she had lived in captivity; and not having received the
protection of the laws, she could not, merely by her
involuntary residence in the country, be supposed to
have subjected herself to their jurisdiction and authori∣ty:
That notwithstanding the superiority of her rank,
she was willing to give an account of her conduct
before an English Parliament; but could not view
these commissioners in any other light, than as men
appointed to justify, by some colour of legal proceeding,
her condemnation and execution: And that she warn∣ed
them to look to their conscience and their charac∣ter,
in trying an innocent person; and to reflect,
that these transactions would somewhere be subject to
<PB N="298" REF="327"/>
revision, and that the theatre of the whole world was
much wider than the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>IN return, the commissioners sent a new deputation,
informing her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣missioners prevail on her to sub∣mit to the trial.</NOTE> that her plea, either from her royal
dignity or from her imprisonment, could not be ad∣mitted;
and that they were empowered to proceed
against her, even tho' she should refuse to appear
before them. Burleigh, the treasurer, and Bromley,
the chancellor, employed much reasoning to make her
submit to the trial; but the person whose arguments
had the chief influence, was Sir Christopher Hatton,
vice-chamberlain. His speech was to this purpose.
“You are accused, Madam,” said he, “but not
condemned, of having conspired the destruction of
our Lady and Queen anointed. You say, you are
a Queen: But, in such a crime as this, and such
a situation as yours, the royal dignity itself, neither
by the civil nor canon law, nor by the law of nature
or or nations, is exempt from judgment. If you
be innocent, you wrong your reputation in avoid∣ing
a trial. We have been present at your pro∣testations
of innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks
otherwise; and is heartily sorry for the appearances
which lie against you. To examine, therefore,
your cause, she has appointed commissioners, honou∣rable
persons, prudent and upright men, who are
ready to hear you with equity, and even with favour,
and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the
imputations which have been thrown upon you.
Believe me, Madam, the Queen herself will rejoice,
who affirmed to me at my departure, that nothing
which ever befel her, had given her so much▪ uneasi∣ness,
as that you should be suspected of a concur∣rence
in these criminal enterprizes. Laying aside,
therefore, the fruitless claim of privilege from your
royal dignity, which can now avail you nothing,
trust to the better defence of your innocence, make
<PB N="299" REF="328"/>
it appear in open trial, and leave not upon your
memory that stain of infamy which must attend your
obstinate silence on this occasion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 523.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>BY this artful speech, Mary was persuaded to appear
before the court; and thereby gave an appearance of
legal procedure to the trial, and prevented those dif∣ficulties,
which the commissioners must have fallen
into, had she persevered in maintaining so specious a
plea as that of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sovereign and independant character.
Her conduct in this particular must be regarded as the
more imprudent, because formerly, when Elizabeth's
commissioners pretended not to exercise any jurisdicti∣on
over her, and only entered into her cause by her
own consent and approbation, she declined justifying
herself, when her honour, which ought to have
been dearer to her than life, seemed absolutely to re∣quire
it.</P>
<P>ON her first appearance before the commissioners,
Mary, either sensible of her imprudence, or still un∣willing
to degrade herself by submitting to a trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial.</NOTE> re∣newed
her protestation against the authority of
her judges: The chancellor answered her by plead∣ing
the supreme authority of the English laws over
every one who resided in England: And the com∣missioners
accommodated matters, by ordering both her
protestation and his answer to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE lawyers of the crown then opened the charge
against the Queen of Scots. They proved, by inter∣cepted
letters, that she had allowed cardinal Allen and
others to treat her as Queen of England; and that she
had kept a correspondence with lord Paget and Charles
Paget, in a view of engaging the Spaniards to invade
the kingdom. Mary seemed not anxious to clear
herself from either of these imputations. She only
said, that she could not hinder others from using what
<PB N="300" REF="329"/>
style they pleased in writing to her; and that it was
lawful for her to try every expedient for the recovery
of her liberty.</P>
<P>AN intercepted letter of her's to Mendoza was next
produced; in which she promised to transfer to Philip
her right to the kingdom of England, if her son should
refuse to be converted to the catholic faith; an event,
she said, of which there was no expectation, while
he remained in the hands of his Scots subjects<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 138.</NOTE>.
Even this part of the charge, she took no pains to
deny, or rather she seemed to acknowlege it. She
said, that she had no kingdoms to dispose of; yet was
it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her
own, and she was not accountable to any for her
actions. She added, that she had formerly rejected
that proposal from Spain, but now, since all her hopes
in England were gone, she was fully determined not
to refuse foreign assistance. There was also produced
evidence to prove, that Allen and Parsons were at that
very time negotiating by her orders in Rome the con∣ditions
of transferring her English crown to the
King of Spain, and of disinheriting her heretical
son<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 525. This evidence was that of Curle, her secretary, whom she allowed to be a very honest man; and who, as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by keeping so long such important secrets, from whose discovery he could have reaped the greatest profit. Mary, after all, thought that she had so little reason to complain of Curle's evidence, that she took care to have him paid a considerable sum by her testament, which she wrote the day before her death. Goodal, vol. I. p. 413. Neither did she forget Nau, tho' less satisfied with his conduct. Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices against
her son were, at this time, carried so far, that she
had even entered into a conspiracy against him, had
appointed lord Claude Hamilton regent of Scotland,
and had instigated her adherents to seize James's per∣son
<PB N="301" REF="330"/>
and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the
King of Spain; whence he was never to be delivered
but on the condition of his becoming catholic<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>The detail of this conspiracy is to be found in a letter of the Queen of Scots to Charles Paget, her great confident. This letter is dated the 20th of May 1586, and is contained in Dr. Forbes's manuscript collections▪ at present in the possession of lord Royston. It is a copy attested by Curle. Mary's secretary, and indorsed by lord Burleigh. What proves its authen∣ticity beyond question is that we find in Murden's Collection, p. 516, that Mary actually wrote that very day a letter to Charles Paget: And farther, she mentions, in the manuscript letter, a letter of Charles Paget's of the roth of April: Now we find by Murden, p. 506. that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date.</P>
<P>This violence of spirit is very consistent with Mary's character. Her maternal affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of her passions, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry, Her son, having made some fruitless attempts to associate her with him in the title, and having found this scheme impracticable, on account of the prejudices of his protestant subjects, at last desisted from that design, and entered into an alliance with England, without comprehending his mother. She was in such a rage at this undutiful behaviour, as she imagined it, that she wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that she no longer cared what became of him or her in the world; the greatest satisfaction she could have before her death was to see him and all his adherents become a signal example of tyranny, ingra∣titude and impiety, and undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedness. She would find in Christendom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in such hands as would retain the firmest hold of it. She cared not, after taking this revenge, what became of her body: The quickest death would then be the most agreeable to her. And she assured her, that, if he persevered, she would disown him for her son, would give him her malediction, would disinherit him, as well of his present possessions as of all he could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her subjects to treat him as they had done her, but to all strangers to subdue and conquer him. It was in vain to employ menaces against her: The fear of death or other misfortune would never induce her to make one step or pronounce one syllable beyond what she had determined: She would rather perish with honour, in maintaining the dignity, to which God had raised her, than degrade herself by the least pusillanimity, or act what was unworthy of her station and of her race. Murden, p. 566, 567,</P>
<P>James said to Courcelles, the French ambassador, that he had seen a letter under her own hand, where she threatned to disinherit him, and said that he might betake him to the lordship of Darnley: For that was all he had by his father. <HI>Courcelles' Letter, a MS. of Dr. Campbel's.</HI> There is in Jebb, vol. II. p. 573, a letter of her's where she throws out the same menace against him.</P>
<P>We find this scheme of seizing the King Scots, and delivering him into the hands of the pope or the King of Spain, proposed by Morgan to Mary. See Murden, p. 525.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="331"/>
THE only part of the charge, which Mary positively
denied, was her concurrence in the design of assassinat∣ing
Queen Elizbeth: This article indeed was the
most heavy, and the only one, which could fully justify
the Queen in proceeding to extremities against her.
In order to prove the accusation, there were produced
the following evidence: Copies taken in secretary
Walsingham's office of the intercepted letters between
her and Babington, in which her approbation of the
murder was clearly expressed; the evidence of her two
secretaries, Nau and Curle, who had sworn without
being put to any torture, that she both received these
letters from Babington, and that they had wrote the
answers by her order; the consfession of Babington,
that he had wrote the letters and received the an∣swers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>; and the confession of Ballard and Savage,
that Babington had showed them these letters of
Mary, wrote in the cypher, which had been settled
between them.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that this seeming complication of
evidence resolves itself finally into the testimony of the
two secretaries, who alone were acquainted with their
mistress's concurrence in Babington's conspiracy, and
who knew themselves exposed to all the rigours of
imprisonment, torture and death, if they refused to
give any evidence, which might be required of them.
In the case of an ordinary criminal, this proof, with
all its disadvantages, would be esteemed legal, and even
satisfactory, if not opposed by some other circum∣stances,
which shake the credit of the witnesses: But
on the present trial, where the absolute power of the
prosecutor concurred with such important interests and
such a strong inclination to have the princess con∣demned;
<PB N="303" REF="332"/>
the testimony of two witnesses, even tho'
men of character, ought to be supported by very strong
circumstances, in order to remove all suspicion of
tyranny and injustice. The proof against Mary, it
must be confessed, is not destituted of this advantage;
and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to account
for Babington's receiving an answer, wrote in her
name, and in the cypher concerted between them,
without allowing, that the matter had been commu∣nicated
to that princess. Such is the light in which
this matter appears, even after time has discovered
every thing, which could guide our judgment with
regard to it: No wonder, therefore, that the Queen
of Scots, unassisted by council, and confounded by so
extraordinary a trial, found herself incapable of mak∣ing
a satisfactory defence before the commissioners.
Her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial: What∣ever
force may be in that denial was much weakened,
by her positively affirming, that she never had had any
correspondence of any kind with Babington; a fact,
however, of which there remains not the least questi∣on<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The volume of State Papers collected by Mr. Murden, prove beyond controversy, that Mary was long in close correspondence with Babington, p. 513, 516, 532. 533. She entertained a like correspondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget, and laid a scheme with them for an insurrection, and for the invasion of England by Spain, p. 528, 531. The same papers show, that there had been a discontinuance of Babington's correspondence, agreeable to Camden's narration. See State Papers, p. 513, where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to renew the cor∣respondence with Babington. The former letters, which passed between that Queen and Babington, seem to have been destroyed by some accident. These circumstances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's denial of guilt, and that her correspondence with Babington contained particu∣lars, which could not be avowed.</NOTE>.
She asserted, that as Nau and Curle had taken
an oath of secrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence
against her ought not to be credited. She confessed,
however, that Nau had been in the service of her uncle,
the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been recommended
<PB N="304" REF="333"/>
to her by the King of France, as a man in whom
she might safely confide. She also acknowleged Curle
to be a very honest man, but simple, and easily im∣posed
on by Nau. If these two men had received any
letters, or had wrote any answers, without her know∣lege;
the imputation, she said, could never lie on her.
And she was the more inclined, she added, to enter∣tain
this suspicion against them, because Nau had, in
other instances, been guilty of a like temerity, and
had ventured to transact business in her name, without
communicating the matter to her<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>There are three suppositions, by which the letter to Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth. The first is, that which she seems herself to have embraced, that her secretaries had received Babington's letter, and had ven∣rured of themselves to answer it, without communicating the matter to her: But it is utterly improbable, that a princess of that sense and spirit would, in an affair of that importance, be so treated by her servants who lived in the house with her, and who had every moment an opportunity of commu∣nicating the fecret to her. If the conspiracy failed, they must expect to suf∣fer the severest punishment from the court of England; if it succeeded, the lightest punishment, which they could hope for from their own mistress, must be disgrace, on account of their temerity, Not to mention, that Ma∣ry's concurrence was in some degree requisite for effectuating the design of her escape: It was proposed to attack her guards, while she was employed in hunting: She must therefore concert the time and place with the conspira∣tors. The second supposition is, that these two secretaries were previously traitors; and being gained by Walsingham, had made such a reply in their mistress's cypher, as might involve her in the guilt of the conspiracy. But these two men had lived long with the Queen of Scots, had been entirely trusted by her, and had never fallen under suspicion either with her or her partizans. Camden tells us, that Curle afterwards claimed a reward from Walsingham on pretence of some promise; but Walsingham told him, that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no discoveries on his examination, which were not known with certainty from other quaters. The third supposition is, that neither the Queen nor the two secretaries, Nau and Curle, ever saw Babington's letter, or made any answer; but that Walsingham, having decyphered the former, forged a reply. But this supposition implies the falshood of the whole story, told by Camden, of Gifford's access to the Queen of Scots's family, and Paulet's refusal to concur in allowing his servants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's and Curle's evidence must, on this supposition, have been extorted by violence and terror, they would necessarily have been engaged, for their own justification, to have told the truth afterwards; especially upon the accession of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event, persisted still in his testimony.</P>
<P>We must also consider, that the two last suppositions imply such a mon∣strous criminal conduct in Walsingham, and consequently in Elizabeth (for the matter could be no secret to her) as exceeds all credibility. If we con∣sider the situation of things and the prejudices of the times, Mary's consent to Babington's conspiracy appears much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be an usurper and a heretic: She regarded her as a per∣sonal and a violent enemy: She knew that schemes of assassinating heretics were very familiar in that age, and generally approved of by the zealous catho∣lies: Her own liberty and sovereignty were connected with the success of this enterprize. And it cannot appear strange, that where men of so much merit as Babington could be engaged, by bigotry alone, in so criminal an enterprize, Mary, who was actuated by thesame motive, joined to so many others, should have given her consent to a scheme projected by her friends. We may be previously certain, that, if such a scheme was ever communicated to her, with any probability of success, she would assent to it: And it served the purpose of Walsingham and the English ministry to facilitate the communi∣cation of these schemes, as soon as they had got an expedient for intercepting her answer, and detecting the conspiracy. Now Walsingham's knowlege of the matter is a supposition necessary to account for the letter delivered to Babington.</P>
<P>As to the not punishing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it never is the practice to punish lesser criminals, who had given evidence against the principal.</P>
<P>But what ought to induce us to reject these three suppositions, is, that they must, all of them, be considered as bare possibilities; The partizans of Mary can give no reason for preferring one to the other: Not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any one of them: Neither at that time, nor at any time after, was any reason discovered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief of any of these three suppositions: and even her apologists at present seem not to have fixed on any choice among these supposed possibilities. The positive proof of two credible witnesses, supported by the other very strong circumstances, still remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an ex∣treme interest to have communication with the Queen of Scots, believed he had found a means of correspondence with her, and had received an answer from her: He, as well as the other conspirators, died in that belief: There has not occurred, since that time, the least argument to prove they were mistaken: Can there be any reason at present to doubt of the truth of their opinion? Camden, tho' a profest apologist for Mary, is con∣strained to tell the story in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt. Such was the impossibility of finding any other consistent account, even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!</P>
<P>In this light might the question have appeared even during Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controversy is the following passage of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July 1586. “As to Babington, he hath both kindly and honestly offered himself and all his means to be employed any way I would. Whereupon I hope to have sa∣tisfied him by two of my several letters, since I had his; and the rather, for that I opened him the way, whereby I received his with your afore∣said.” Murden, p. 533. Babington confessed, that he had offered her to assassinate the Queen; It appears by this, that she had accepted the offer: So that all the suppositions of Walsingham's forgery, or her secretary's temerity or treachery, fall to the ground.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="334"/>
THE sole circumstance of her defence, which to us
may appear to have some force, was her requiring that
Nau and Curle should be confronted with her, and

affirming that they never would to her face persist in
their evidence. But that demand, however equitable,
was not supported by law in trials of high treason, and
was often refused even in other trials where the crown
was prosecutor. The clause, contained in an act of
the 13th of the Queen, was a novelty; that the species
of treason there enumerated must be proved by two
witnesses, confronted with the criminal. But Mary
was not tried upon that act; and the ministers and
crown lawyers of this reign were always sure to refuse
every indulgence beyond what the strict letter of the
law and the settled practice of the courts of justice re∣quired
of them. Not to mention, that these secretaries
were not probably at Fotheringay during the time of the
trial, and could not, upon Mary's demand, be produced
by the commissioners<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Queen Elizabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be pro∣duced in the trial, and writes to that purpose, to Burleigh and Walsingham, in her letter of the 7th of October, in Forbes's MS. collections. She only says, that she thinks it needless, tho' she was willing to agree to it. The not confronting the witnesses was not the result of design, but the practice of the age.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE passed two incidents in this trial, which
may be worth observing. A letter between Mary and
Babington was read, in which mention was made of
the earl of Arundel and his brothers: On hearing
their names she broke into a sigh, “Alas,” said she,
<PB N="307" REF="340"/>
what has that noble house of the Howards suffered
for my sake!” She affirmed, with regard to the same
letter, that it was easy to forge the hand-writing and
cypher of another; she was afraid, that this was too
familiar a practice with Walsingham, who, she also
heard, had frequently practised both against her life and
her son's. Walsingham, who was one of the com∣missioners,
rose up. He protested, that in his private
capacity, he had never acted any thing against the
Queen of Scots: In his public capacity, he owned,
that his concern for his sovereign's safety had made
him very diligent in searching out, by every expedient,
all designs against her sacred person or her authority.
For attaining that end, he would not only make
use of the assistance of Ballard or any other conspirator:
He would also reward them for betraying their com∣panions.
But if he had tampered in any manner, un∣worthy
of his character and office, why did none of the
late criminals either at their trial or execution, accuse
him of such practices? Mary endeavoured to pacify
him by saying that she spoke from information; and
she begged him, that he would thenceforth give no
more credit to such as slandered her, than she would to
such as accused him. The great character indeed,
which Sir Francis Walsingham bears for probity and
honour, should remove from him all suspicion of such
base arts as forgery and subornation; arts, which even
the most corrupt ministers in the most corrupt times
would scruple to employ.</P>
<P>HAVING finished the trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> the commissioners ad∣journed
from Fotheringay, and met in the Star Cham∣ber
at London; where, after taking the oaths of Mary's
two secretaries, who, voluntarily, without hope or
reward, vouched the authenticity of those letters before
produced, they pronounced sentence of death upon
the Queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their seals and
subscriptions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence a∣gainst Mary.</NOTE> The same day, a declaration was pub∣lished
<PB N="308" REF="341"/>
by the commissioners and the judges, “that the
sentence did no wise derogate from the title and honour
of James, King of Scotland; but that he was in the
same place, degree, and right, as if the sentence
had never been pronounced<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 526.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE Queen had now brought her affairs with Mary
to that situation, which she had long ardently desired;
and had found a plausible reason for executing vengeance
on a competitor, whom, from the beginning of her
reign, she had ever equally dreaded and hated. But
she was restrained from gratifying instantly her re∣sentment,
by several important considerations. She
foresaw the invidious colours in which this example of
uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the
numerous partizans of Mary, and the reproach, to
which she herself might be exposed with all foreign
princes, perhaps with all posterity. The rights of
hospitality, of kindred, and of royal majesty, seemed
in one signal instance to be all violated; and this sacri∣fice
of generosity to interest, of clemency to revenge,
might appear equally unbecoming a soverereign and a
woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent
hypocrite, pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed
to the execution of the sentence, affected the most tender
sympathy with her prisoner, displayed all her scruples
and difficulties, rejected the sollicitation of her courtiers
and ministers, and affirmed, that, were she not moved
by the deepest concern for her people's safety, she would
not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries, which
she herself had received from the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>THAT the voice of her people might be more audibly
heard in the demand of justice upon Mary, she sum∣moned
a new Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th Octo∣ber.</NOTE> and she knew, both from
the usual dispositions of that assembly, and from the
influence of her ministers over them, that she should
not want the most earnest sollicitation to consent to
<PB N="309" REF="342"/>
that measure, which was so agreeable to her secret
inclinations. She did not open this assembly in person,
but appointed for that purpose three commissioners, the
chancellor Bromley, the treasurer Burleigh, and the
earl of Derby. The reason assigned for this measure,
was, that the Queen, foreseeing that the affair of the
Queen of Scots would be tried in Parliament, found
her tenderness and delicacy so much hurt by that
melancholy incident, that she had not the courage
to be present while it was under deliberation, but
withdrew her eyes from what she could not behold
without the utmost reluctance and uneasiness. She was
also willing, that, by this unusual caution, the people
should see the danger, to which her person was hourly
exposed; and should thence be more strongly incited
to take vengeance on the criminal, whose restless in∣trigues
and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her
to the most imminent perils<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 375.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament answered the Queen's expectations:
The sentence against Mary was unanimously ratified by
both houses; and an application was agreed on to obtain
Elizabeth's consent to its publication and execution<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 379.</NOTE>.
She gave them an answer ambiguous, embarrassed; full
of real artifice, and seeming irresolution. She men∣tioned
the extreme danger to which her life was con∣tinually
exposed; she declared her willingness to die,
did she not foresee the great calamities, which would
thence fall upon the nation; she made professions of
the greatest tenderness to her people; she displayed the
clemency of her temper, and expressed her violent re∣luctance
to proceed to extremities against her unhappy
kinswoman; she affirmed, that the late laws by which
that princess was tried, so far from being made to
ensnare her, was only intended to give her warning
beforehand, not to engage in such attempts, as might
expose her to the penalties, with which she was thus
<PB N="310" REF="343"/>
openly menaced; and she begged them to think once
again, whether it was possible to find any other ex∣pedient
besides the death of the Queen of Scots for
securing the public tranquillity<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 402, 403.</NOTE>. The Parliament,
in obedience to her commands, took the affair again
under consideration; but could find no other possible
expedient. They reiterated their sollicitations, and
entreaties, and arguments: They even remonstrated,
that mercy to the Queen of Scots was cruelty to them,
her subjects and children: And they affirmed, that it
were injustice to deny execution of the law to any
individual; much more, to the whole body of the
people, now unanimously and earnestly suing for this
pledge of her parental care and tenderness. This second
address set the pretended doubts and scruples of Eliza∣beth
anew in agitation: She complained of her own
unfortunate situation; expressed her uneasiness from
their importunity; renewed the professions of affection
to her people; and dismissed the committee of Par∣liament
in an uncertainty, what, after all this deli∣beration,
might be her final resolution<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>This Parliament granted the Queen a supply of a subsidy and two fifteenths. They adjourned, and met again after the execution of the Queen of Scots; when there passed some remarkable incidents, which it may be proper not to omit. We shall give them in the words of Sir Simon D'Ewes, p. 410, 411, which are almost wholly transcribed from Townsend's Journal. On Monday the 27th of February, Mr. Cope, first using some speeches touching the necessity of a learned ministry and the amendment of things amiss in the ecclesiastical estate, offered to the house a bill and a book written; the bill containing a petition, that it might be enacted, that all laws now in force touching ecclesiastical government should be void: And that it might be enacted that that book of common prayer now offered, and none other, might be received into the church to be used. The book contained the form of prayer and administration of the sacraments, with divers rites and ceremonies to be used in the church; and he desired that the book might be read. Whereupon Mr. Speaker in effect used this speech: For that her majesty before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with this matter, and that her majesty had promised to take order in those causes, he doubted not but to the good satisfaction of all her people, he desired that it would please them to spare the reading of it. Notwithstanding the house desired the reading of it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker desired the clerk to read. And the court being ready to read it, Mr. Dalton made a motion against the reading of it; saying, that it was not meet to be read, and it did appoint a new form of administration of the sacraments and ceremonies of the church, to the dis∣credit of the book of common prayer and of the whole state; and thought that this dealing would bring her majesty's indignation against the house, thus to enterprize this dealing with those things which her majesty especially had taken into her own charge and direction. Whereupon Mr. Lewkenor spake, shewing the necessity of preaching and of a learned ministry, and thought it very sit that the petition and book should be read. To this pur∣pose spake Mr. Hurleston and Mr. Bainbrigg; and so, the time being passed, the house broke up, and neither the petition nor book read. This done, her majesty sent to Mr. Speaker, as well for this petition and book, as for that other petition and book for the like effect, that was delivered the last session of Parliment, which Mr. Speaker sent to her majesty. On Tuesday the 28th of February, her Majesty sent for Mr. Speaker, by occa∣sion whereof the house did not sit. On Wednesday the first day of March, Mr. Wentworth delivered to Mr. Speaker certain articles, which contained questions touching the liberties of the house, and to some of which he was to answer, and desired they might be read. Mr. Speaker desired him to spare his motion, until her Majesty's pleasure was further known touching the petition and book lately delivered into the house; but Mr. Wentworth would not be so satisfied, but required his articles might be read. Mr. Wentworth introduced his queries by lamenting, that he as well as many others were deterred from speaking, by their want of knowlege and experience in the liberties of the house; and the queries were as follow: Whether this coun∣cil were not a place for any member of the same here assembled, freely and without controulment of any person or danger of laws, by bill or speech to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever touching the service of God, the safety of the prince and this noble realm? Whether that great honour may be done unto God, and benefit and service unto the prince and state, without free speech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there be any council which can make, add, or diminish from the laws of the realm but only this council of Parliament? Whether it be not against the orders of this council to make any secret or matter of weight, which is here in hand, known to the prince or any other, concerning the high service of God, prince or state, without the consent of the house? Whether the speaker or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his speech used in this house tending to any of the forenamed services? Whether the speaker may rise when he will, any matter being pro∣pounded, without consent of the house or not? Whether the speaker may over-rule the house in any matter or cause there in question, or whether he is to be ruled or over-rule<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in any matter or not? Whether the prince and state can continue, and stand, and be maintained, without this council of Parliament, not altering the government of the state? At the end of these questions, says Sir Simon D'Ewes, I found set down this short note or memorial ensuing: By which it may be perceived, both what serjeant Puckering, the speaker, did with the said questions after he had received them, and what became also of this business, viz. “These questions Mr. Puckering pocketed up and shewed Sir Thomas Heneage, who so handled the matter, that Mr. Wentworth went to the Tower, and the questions not at all moved. Mr. Buckler of Essex herein brake his faith in forsaking the matter, &amp;c. and no more was done.” After setting down, continues Sir Simon D'Ewes, the said business of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows only this short conclusion of the day itself, viz. “This day, Mr. Speaker being sent for to the Queen's majesty, the house departed.” On Thursday the second of March, Mr. Cope, Mr. Lewkenor, Mr. Hurlston, and Mr. Bainbrigg were sent for to my lord chancellor and by divers of the privy council, and from thence were sent to the Tower. On Saturday, the fourth day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this house, for that divers good and necessary members thereof were taken from them, that it would please them to be humble petitioners to her majesty for the restitution of them again to the house. To which speeches Mr. vice-chamberlain answered, that if the gentle∣men were committed for matter within the compass of the privilege of this house, then there might be a petition; but if not, then we should give occasion to her majesty's farther displeasure: And therefore advised to stay until they heard more, which could not be long: And farther, he said touching the book and the petition, her majesty had, for diverse good causes best known to herself, thought fit to suppress the same, without any far∣ther examination thereof; and yet thought it very unfit for her majesty to give any account of her doings.—But whatsoever Mr. vice-chamber∣lain pretended, it is most probable these members were committed for intermeddling with matters touching the church, which her majesty had often inhibited, and which had caused so much disputation and so many meetings between the two houses the last Parliament.”</P>
<P>This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D'Ewes and Townsend; and it appears that those members, who had been committed, were detain∣ed in custody till the Queen thought fit to release them. These questions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; because they contain the first faint dawn∣ings of the present English constitution; tho' suddenly eclipsed by the arbitra∣ry government of Elizabeth. Wentworth was indeed, by his puritanism, as well as his love of liberty (for these two characters, of such unequal merit, arose and advanced together) the true forerunner of the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Hollises, who, in the next age, with less courage, because with less danger, rendered their principles so triumphant. I shall only ask, whether it be not sufficiently clear from all these transactions, that in the two succeeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign; not the sovereign, who attempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon people?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="344"/>
BUT tho' the Queen affected reluctance to execute
the sentence against Mary, she complied with the Par∣liament's
request to publish it; and the proclamation
<PB N="312" REF="345"/>
seemed to be attended with the unanimous and hearty
rejoicings of the people. The lord Buckhurst, and
<PB N="313" REF="346"/>
Beale, clerk to the Council, were sent to the Queen
of Scots, and notified to her the sentence pronounced
against her, its ratification by Parliament, and the
earnest applications made for its execution by that
assembly, who thought, that their religion could never,
while she was alive attain a full settlement and securi∣ty.
Mary was no wise dismayed at this intelligence:
On the contrary, she joyfully laid hold of the last cir∣cumstance
mentioned to her; and insisted, that since
her death was demanded by the protestants for the
establishment of their faith, she was really a martyr
to her religion, and was intitled to all the merits,
attending that glorious character. She added, that
the English had often imbrued their hands in the blood
of their sovereigns: No wonder, they exercised cruelty
towards her, who derived her descent from these
monarchs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 528.</NOTE>. Paulet her keeper, received orders to take
down her canopy, and to serve her no longer with that
respect, due to sovereign princes. He told her, that
she was now to be considered as a dead person; and
incapable of any dignity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 293.</NOTE>. This insult she received
without any seeming emotion. She only replied, that
she received her royal character from the hands of the
Almighty, and no earthly power was ever able to
bereave her of it.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Eliza∣beth;
full of dignity, without departing from that spirit
of meekness and of charity, which appeared suitable
to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life. She
preferred no petition for averting the fatal sentence:
On the contrary, she expressed her gratitude to heaven
<PB N="314" REF="347"/>
for thus bringing to a speedy period her sad and lamenta∣ble
pilgrimage. She requested some favours of Eliza∣beth,
and intreated her, that she might be beholden for
them to her own goodness alone, without making ap∣plications
to those ministers, who had discovered such
an extreme antipathy to her person and her religion.
She desired, that, after her enemies should be satiated
with her innocent blood, her body, which, it was
determined, should never enjoy rest, while her soul
was united to it, might be consigned to her servants,
and be conveyed by them into France, there to repose
in a catholic land, with the sacred relicts of her
mother. In Scotland, she said, the sepulchres of her
ancestors were violated, and the churches either
demolished or profaned; and in England, where she
might be enterred among the antient kings, her own
and Elizabeth's progenitors, she could entertain no
hopes of being accompanied to the grave with those
rites and ceremonies, which her religion required.
She desired that no one might have the power of in∣flicting
a private death upon her, without Elizabeth's
knowlege; but that her execution should be public,
and attended by her antient servants, who might bear
testimony of her perseverance in the faith, and of her
submission to the will of heaven. She begged, that
these servants might afterwards be allowed to depart
whither they pleased, and might enjoy those legacies
which she should bequeath them. And she conjured
her to grant these favours, by their near kindred, by
the soul and memory of Henry the seventh, the common
ancestor of both, and by the royal dignity of which
they equally participated<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 529. Jebb, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE>. Elizabeth made no answer
to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refusal in
her present situation, and foreseeing inconveniencies
from granting some of her requests.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="348"/>
WHILE the Queen of Scots thus prepared herself to
meet her fate, great efforts were made by foreign
powers with Elizabeth to prevent the execution of
the sentence, pronounced against her. Besides em∣ploying
L'Aubespine, the French resident at London,
a man devoted to the house of Guise, Henry sent
over Bellievre, with a professed intention of interceding
for the life of Mary. The duke of Guise and the
league, at that time, threatened very nearly the King's
authority; and Elizabeth knew, that, tho' that monarch
might, from decency and policy, think himself obliged
to interpose publicly in behalf of the Queen of Scots,
he could not secretly be much displeased with the death
of a princess, on whose fortune and elevation his
mortal enemies had always founded so many daring
and ambitious projects<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 494.</NOTE>. It is even pretended, that
Bellievre had orders, after making public and vehe∣ment
remonstrances against the execution of Mary, to
exhort privately the Queen, in his master's name,
not to defer an act of justice, so necessary for their
common interests<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Du Maurier.</NOTE>. But whether the French King's
intercession was sincere or not, it had no weight
with the Queen; and she still persisted in her former
resolution.</P>
<P>THE interposition of the young King of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interposition of King James.</NOTE> tho'
it was not able to change Elizabeth's determination,
seemed, on every account, to merit more attention.
So soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation
of his mother, he sent Sir William Keith, gentleman
of his bed chamber, to London; and wrote a letter
to the Queen, in which he remonstrated, in very
severe terms, against the indignity of the procedure.
He said, that he was astonished to hear of the pre∣sumption
of English noblemen and counsellors, who
had dared to sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a
Queen of Scotland, descended from the royal blood
<PB N="316" REF="349"/>
of England; but was still more astonished to hear,
that thoughts were seriously entertained of putting
that sentence in execution: That he entreated Eliza∣beth
to reflect on the dishonour, which she would
draw on her name by embruing her hands in the
blood of her near kinswoman, a person of the same
royal dignity and of the same sex with herself: That
in this unparalleled attempt, she offered an affront to all
diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing so∣vereigns
to a level with other men, taught the people
to neglect all duty towards those whom Providence had
appointed to rule over them: That for his part, he
must esteem the injury and insult so enormous, as to
be incapable of all attonement; nor was it possible
for him thenceforth to remain on any terms of corre∣spondence
with a person, who, without any pretence
of legal authority, had deliberately inflicted an igno∣minious
death upon his parent: And that even if the
sentiments of nature and duty did not inspire him with
this purpose of vengeance, his own honour required it
of him; nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes
of the world, if he did not use every effort, and endure
every hazard, to revenge so great an indignity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 351.</NOTE>.
Soon after, James sent the master of Gray and Sir
Robert Melvil to enforce the remonstrances of Keith;
and to employ with the Queen every expedient of ar∣gument
and menaces. Elizabeth was at first offended
with the sharpness of these applications; and she re∣plied
in a like strain to the Scots ambassadors. When
she afterwards reflected, that this earnestness was no
more than what duty required of James, she was
pacified; but retained still her resolution of proceed∣ing
to extremities against Mary<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 353.</NOTE>. It is believed,
that the master of Gray, gained by the enemies of
that princess, gave secretly his advice not to spare
<PB N="317" REF="350"/>
her, and undertook, in all events, to pacify his master.
The Queen also, from many circumstances, was in∣duced
to pay small attention to the applications of
James, and to disregard all the efforts, which he could
employ in behalf of his mother. She was well ac∣quainted
with his character and interests, the factions
which prevailed among his people, and the inveterate
hatred, which the zealous protestants, particularly the
preachers, bore to the Queen of Scots. The present
incidents put these dispositions of the clergy in a full
light. James, observing the fixed purpose of Eliza∣beth,
ordered prayers to be offered up for his mother in
all the churches; and knowing the captious humour
of the ecclesiastics, he took care that the form of the
petition should be most cautious, as well as humane
and charitable: “That it might please God to illumi∣nate
Mary with the light of his truth, and save
her from the apparent danger with which she was
threatned.” But excepting the King's own chap∣lains,
and one clergyman more, all the preachers re∣fused
to pollute their churches by prayers for a papist,
and would not so much as prefer a petition for her
conversion. James, unwilling or unable to punish
this disobedience, and desirous of giving the preachers
an opportunity of amending their fault, appointed a
new day when prayers should be said for his mother;
and that he might at least secure himself from any
insult in his own presence, he desired the archbishop
of St. Andrews to preach before him. In order to dis∣appoint
this purpose, the clergy instigated one Couper,
a young man, who had not yet received holy orders,
to take possession of the pulpit early in the morning,
and to exclude the prelate. When the King came to
church, and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he
called to him from his seat, and told him, that the
place was destined for another; yet since he was there, if
<PB N="318" REF="351"/>
he would obey the charge given, and remember the
Queen in his prayers, he might proceed to divine
service. The preacher replied, that he would do as
the spirit of God should direct him. This answer,
sufficiently instructed James in his purpose; and he
commanded him to leave the pulpit. As Couper
seemed not disposed to obey, the captain of the guard
went to pull him from his place; upon which the
young man cried aloud, that this day would be a
witness against the King in the great day of the Lord;
and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edin∣burgh
for permitting him to be treated in that man∣ner<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 354.</NOTE>. The audience at first appeared desirous to take
part with him; but the sermon of the prelate brought
them over to a more dutiful and more humane dis∣position.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH,
when sollicited, either by James or
by foreign princes, to pardon the Queen of Scots,
seemed always determined to proceed to extremities
against her: But when her ministers urged her to
interpose no more delays in the execution, her scruples
and her hesitation returned; her humanity could not
allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary
measures; and she was touched with compassion for
the misfortunes, and with respect for the dignity, of
the unhappy prisoner. The courtiers, sensible that
they could do nothing more acceptable to her, than
to employ persuasion on this head, failed not to enforce
every motive for the punishment of Mary, and to com∣bat
all the objections urged against that act of justice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for the execution of Mary.</NOTE>
They said, that the treatment of that princess in Eng∣gland
had been, on her first reception, such as sound
reason and policy required; and if she had been govern∣ed
by principles of equity, she would not have re∣fused
willingly to acquiesce in it: That the obvious
<PB N="319" REF="352"/>
inconveniences, either of allowing her to retire into
France, or of restoring her by force to her throne,
in opposition to the protestants, and the English party
in Scotland, had obliged the Queen to detain her in
England, till time should offer some opportunity of
serving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to
the protestant religion: That her usage there had been
such as became her rank; her own servants, in con∣siderable
numbers, had been permitted to attend her;
exercise had been allowed her for her health, and all
access of company for amusement; and these indul∣gencies
would, in time, have been carried farther, if
by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy
of them: That after she had instigated the rebellion
of Northumberland, the conspiracy of Norfolk, the
bull of excommunication of pope Pius, an invasion
from Flanders; after she had seduced the Queen's
friends, and incited every enemy, foreign or domestic,
against her; it became necessary to treat her as a most
dangerous rival, and to render her confinement more
strict and rigorous: That the Queen, notwithstanding
these repeated provocations, had, in her favour, re∣jected
the importunity of her Parliaments, and the
advice of her sagest ministers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 276. Strype, vol. II. p. 48, 135, 136, 139.</NOTE>; and was still, in hopes
of her amendment, determined to delay coming to
the last extremity against her: That Mary, even in
this forlorn condition, retained so high and uncon∣querable
a spirit, that she acted as competitor to the
crown, and allowed her partizans every where, and
in their very letters, addressed to herself, to treat her
as Queen of England: That she had carried her animo∣sity
so far as to encourage the atrocious design of
assassinating the Queen; and this crime was unques∣tionably
proved upon her, by her own letters, by the
evidence of her secretaries, and by the dying confes∣sion
<PB N="320" REF="353"/>
of her accomplices: That she was but a titular
Queen, and at present possessed no where any right of
sovereignty; much less in England, where every one
was subject to the laws, and to Elizabeth, the only true
sovereign: That even allowing her to be still the
Queen's equal in rank and dignity, self-defence was
permitted by a law of nature, which could never be abro∣gated;
and every one, still more a Queen, had suffi∣cient
jurisdiction over an enemy, who by open violence,
and still more, who by secret treachery, threatned
the utmost danger against her life: That the general
combination of the catholics to exterminate the pro∣testants,
was no longer a secret; and as the sole re∣source
of the latter persecuted sect lay in Elizabeth, so
the chief hope which the former entertained of final
success, consisted in the person, and in the title of the
Queen of Scots: That this very circumstance brought
matters to extremity between these princesses, and
rendering the life of the one the death of the other,
pointed out to Elizabeth the path, which either regard
to self-preservation, or to the happiness of her people,
should direct her to follow: And that necessity, more
powerful than policy, thus demanded of the Queen,
that resolution which equity would authorize, and
which duty prescribed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 533.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Elizabeth thought that as many importuni∣ties
had been used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1587.</NOTE> and as much delay interposed, as
decency required, she at last determined to carry the
sentence into execution: But even in this last resolution
she could not proceed without displaying a new scene
of duplicity and artifice. In order to alarm the vulgar,
rumours were previously dispersed, that the Spanish
fleet was arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots
had made an irruption into England; that the duke
of Guise was landed in Sussex with a strong army;
that the Queen of Scots was escaped from prison,
<PB N="321" REF="354"/>
and had raised an army; that the northern counties had
begun an insurrection; that there was a new conspira∣cy
on foot to assassinate the Queen, and set the city of
London on fire; nay, that the Queen was actually
assassinated<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 533.</NOTE>. A criminal attempt of this nature was
even imputed to L'Aubespine, the French ambassador;
and that minister was obliged to leave the kingdom.
The Queen, affecting to be in great terror and per∣plexity,
was observed to sit much alone, pensive and
silent, and sometimes to mutter to herself half senten∣ces,
importing the difficulty and distress to which she
was reduced<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 534.</NOTE>. She at last called Davison, a man of
parts, but easy to be imposed on, and who had lately,
for that very reason, been made secretary; and she or∣dered
him, to draw out secretly a warrant for the exe∣cution
of the Queen of Scots; which, she afterwards
said, she intended to keep by her, in case any attempt
should be made for the delivery of that princess. She
signed the warrant; and then commanded Davison to
carry it to the chancellor, in order to have the seal af∣fixed
to it. Next day she sent Killigrew to Davison,
enjoining him to forbear some time executing her for∣mer
orders; and when Davison came and told her, that
the warrant had already passed the seals, she seemed to
be somewhat moved, and blamed him for his precipita∣tion.
Davison, being in some perplexity, acquainted
the council with this whole transaction; and they en∣deavoured
to persuade him to send off Beale, clerk of
the council, with the warrant: If the Queen should be
displeased, they promised to justify his conduct, and to
take on themselves the whole blame of this measure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">It appears by some letters published by Strype, vol. III. book ii. c. 1. that Elizabeth had not expressly communicated her intention to any of her ministers, not even to Burleigh: They were such experienced courtiers, that they knew they could not gratify her more than by serving her with∣out waiting till she desired them.</NOTE>.
<PB N="322" REF="355"/>
The secretary, not perceiving their intention, compli∣ed
with the advice, and the warrant was dispatched to
the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, and some others,
ordering them to see the sentence executed upon the
Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>THE two earls came to Fotheringay;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Februa∣ry.</NOTE> and being in∣troduced
to Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The execu∣tion.</NOTE> informed her of their commission,
and told her to prepare for death next morning at eight
o' clock. She seem'd not terrifyed, tho' somewhat sur∣prized,
with the intelligence. She said, with a chear∣ful,
and even a smiling countenance, that she did not
think the Queen, her sister, would have consented to
her death, or have executed the sentence against a per∣son
who was not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of
England. “But as such is her will,” said she,
death, which puts an end to all my miseries, shall
be to me most welcome; nor can I esteem that soul
worthy the felicities of heaven, which cannot sup∣port
the body under the horrors of the last passage
to these blissful mansions<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 534. Jebb, vol. II. p. 301, MS. in the Advocate's li∣brary, p. 2. from the Cott. Lib. Cal, c. 9.</NOTE>.” She then requested
the two noblemen, that they would permit some of her
servants, and particularly her confessor, to attend her:
But they told her, that compliance with this last de∣mand
was contrary to their conscience<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 302.</NOTE>, and that Dr.
Fletcher, dean of Peterborow, a man of great learning,
should be present, to instruct her in the principles of
true religion. Her refusal to have any conference with
this divine inflamed the earl of Kent's zeal; and he
bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of their
religion; as, on the contrary, her life would have
been the death of it. Mention being made of Babing∣ton,
she constantly denied his conspiracy to have been
at all known to her; and the revenge of her wrong, she
resigned into the hands of the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="356"/>
WHEN the earls had left her she ordered supper to
be hastened, that she might have the more leisure to fi∣nish
the few affairs which remained to her in this
world, and to prepare for her passage to another. It
was necessary for her, she said, to take some sustenance,
lest a failure of her bodily strength should depress her
spirits on the morrow, and lest her behaviour should
thereby betray a weakness unworthy of herself<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 489.</NOTE>. She
supped sparingly, as her manner usually was; and her
wonted chearfulness did not even desert her on this oc∣casion.
She comforted her servants under the afflic∣tion
which overwhelmed them, and which was too
powerful for them to conceal from her. Turning to
Burgoin, her physician, she asked him, whether he did
not remark the great and invincible force of truth.
“They pretend,” said she, “that I must die, be∣cause
I conspired against the Queen's life: But the
earl of Kent avowed, that there was no other cause
of my death, but the apprehensions, which, if I
should live, they entertain for their religion. My
constancy in the faith is my real crime: The rest is
only a colour, invented by interested and designing
men.” Towards the end of supper, she called in
all her servants, and drank to them: They pledged
her, in order, on their knees; and craved her pardon
for any past neglect of their duty: She deigned, in re∣turn,
to ask their pardon for her offences towards them;
and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last so∣lemn
farewel, and exchange of mutual forgiveness<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. II. p. 302, 626. Camden, p. 534.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HER care of her servants was the sole remaining af∣fair
which employed her concern in this world. She
perused her will, in which she had provided for them
by legacies: She ordered the inventory of her goods,
cloaths, and jewels to be brought her; and she wrote

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="324" REF="359"/>
wrote down the names of those to whom she bequeath∣ed
each particular: To some she distributed money
with her own hands; and she adapted the recompence
to their different degrees of rank and merit. She wrote
also letters of recommendation for her servants to the
French King, and to her cousin the duke of Guise,
whom she made the chief executor of her testament.
At her wonted time she went to bed, slept some hours;
and then rising, spent the rest of the night in prayer.
Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of
her religion, she had had the precaution to obtain a
consecrated hoste from the hands of Pope Pius, and she
had reserved the use of it for this last period of her life.
By this expedient she supplied, as much as she could,
the want of a priest and confessor, who was refused
her<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the morning she dressed herself in a rich
habit of silk and velvet, the only one which she had
reserved to herself. She told her maids, that she would
willingly have left them this dress rather than the plain
garb which she wore the day before: But it was ne∣cessary
for her to appear at the ensuing solemnity in a
decent habit.</P>
<P>THOMAS Andrews, sheriff of the county, entered
the room, and informed her, that the hour was come,
and that he must attend her to the place of execution.
She replied, that she was ready; and bidding adieu to
her servants, she leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet's
guards, because of an infirmity in her limbs; and she
followed the sheriff with a serene and composed aspect.
In passing thro' a hall adjoining to her chamber, she
was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, Sir
Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gen∣tlemen
of distinction. Here she also found Sir An∣drew
Melvil, her steward, who flung himself on his
<PB N="325" REF="360"/>
knees before her; and, wringing his hands, cried
aloud: “Ah! madam! unhappy me! What man was
ever before the messenger of such heavy tidings as I
must carry, when I shall return to my native country,
and shall report, that I saw my gracious Queen and
Mistress beheaded in England?” His tears prevented
further speech; and Mary too felt herself moved, more
from sympathy than affliction. “Cease, my good ser∣vant,”
said she, “cease to lament: Thou hast cause
rather to rejoice than to mourn: For now shalt thou
see the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long
expected period and completion.” “Know,” con∣tinued
she, “good servant, that all the world at best
is vanity, and subject still to more sorrow than a
whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray
thee, carry this message from me, that I die a true
woman to my religion, and unalterable in my af∣fections
to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive
them, that have long desired my end, and have thirst∣ed
for my blood as the hart panteth after the wa∣ter
brooks.” “O God,” added she, “thou that
art the author of truth and truth itself, thou know∣est
the inmost recesses of my heart: Thou knowest,
that I was ever desirous, to preserve an entire union
between Scotland and England, and to obviate the
source of all these fatal discords. But recommend
me, Melvil, to my son, and tell him, that, notwith∣standing
all my distresses, I have done nothing pre∣judicial
to the state and kingdom of Scotland.”
After these words, reclining herself, with weeping eyes,
and face bedewed with tears, she kissed him. “And
so,” said she, “good Melvil, farewell: Once again,
farewell, good Melvil; and grant the assistance of
thy prayers to thy Queen and mistress<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 4. Jebb, vol. II. p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. Strype, vol. III. p. 384.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="361"/>
SHE then turned to the noblemen who attended
her, and made a petition in behalf of her servants,
that they might be well treated, that they might be
allowed to enjoy the presents which she had made
them, and be sent safely into their own country.
Having received a favourable answer, she moved ano∣ther
request, that they might be permitted to attend her
at her death: In order, said she, that their eyes may be∣hold,
and their hearts bear witness, how patiently their
Queen and mistress can bear her execution, and how
constantly she perseveres in her attachments to her reli∣gion.
The earl of Kent opposed this desire, and told
her, that they would be apt, by their speeches and cries,
both to disturb herself and the spectators: He was also
apprehensive, lest they should practise some superstition,
unmeet for him to suffer; such as dipping their hand∣kerchiefs
in her blood: For that was the instance
which he made use of. “My lord,” said the
Queen of Scots, “I will give my word (altho' it be
but dead) that they shall not incur any blame in any
of the actions which you have named. But alas!
poor souls! it would be a great consolation to them
to bid their mistress farewel. And I hope,” added
she, “that your mistress, being a maiden Queen,
would vouchsafe, in regard of womanhood, that I
should have some of my own people about me at my
death. I know, that her majesty hath not given you
any such strict command, but that you might grant
me a request of far greater courtesy, even tho' I
were a woman of much inferior rank to that which
I bear.” Finding that the earl of Kent persisted
still in his refusal, her mind, which had fortified itself
against the terrors of death, was affected by this cir∣cumstance
of indignity, for which she was not prepared.
I am cousin to your Queen,” cried she, “and de∣scended
from the blood-royal of Henry the seventh, and
a married Queen of France, and an anointed Queen
of Scotland.” The commissioners perceiving how
<PB N="327" REF="362"/>
invidious their obstinacy would appear, conserred a lit∣tle
together, and agreed, that she might carry a few of
her servants along with her. She made choice of four
men, and two maid-servants, for that purpose.</P>
<P>SHE then passed into another hall, where was erected
the scaffold, covered with black; and she saw, with an
undismayed countenance, the two executioners, and
all the preparations of death. The room was crowded
with spectators, and no one was so steeled against all
sentiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he
reflected on her royal dignity, considered the surprizing
train of her misfortunes, beheld her mild but inflexible
constancy, recalled her amiable accomplishments, or
surveyed her beauties, which, tho' faded by years, and
yet more by her afflictions, still discovered themselves
in this fatal moment. Here the warrant for her exe∣cution
was read to her; and during this ceremony she
was silent, but shewed, in her behaviour, an indiffer∣ence
and unconcern, as if the business had no wise re∣garded
her. Before the executioners performed their
office, the dean of Peterborow stepped forth; and tho'
the Queen frequently told him, that he needed not
concern himself about her, that she was settled in the
antient catholic and Roman religion, and that she meant
to lay down her life in defence of that faith; he still
thought it his duty to persist in his lectures and exhor∣tations,
and to endeavour her conversion. The terms,
which he employed, were, under colour of pious in∣structions,
very cruel insults on her unfortunate situati∣on;
and, besides their own absurdity, may be regarded
as the most mortifying indignities, to which she was ever
yet exposed. He told her, that the Queen of England
had in this moment shewn a tender care of her; and
notwithstanding the punishment justly to be inflicted on
her, for her manifold trespasses, was determined to use
every expedient for saving her soul from that destruction
<PB N="328" REF="363"/>
with which it was so nearly threatned; That she was
now standing upon the brink of eternity, and had no
other means of escaping endless perdition, but by repent∣ing
her of her former wickedness, by justifying the sen∣tence
pronounced against her, by acknowleging the
Queen's favours, and by exerting a true and lively faith
in Christ Jesus: That the scriptures were the only rule
of doctrine, the merits of Christ the only means of sal∣vation;
and, if she trusted in the inventions or devi∣ces
of men, she must expect in a moment to fall into
utter darkness, into a place where shall be weeping,
howling, and gnashing of teeth: That the hand of
death was upon her, the ax was laid to the root of the
tree, the throne of the great judge of heaven was erect∣ed,
the book of her life was spre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d wide, and the par∣ticular
sentence and judgment was ready to be pro∣nounced
upon her: And that it was now, during this
important moment, in her choice, either to rise to the
resurrection of life, and hear that joyful salutation,
<HI>Come, ye blessed of my Father,</HI> or to share the resurrection
of condemnation, replete with sorrow and grief; and to
suffer that dreadful denunciation, <HI>Go, ye cursed, into ever∣lasting
fire</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 8, 9, 10, 11. Strype, vol. III. p. 385.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this discourse the Queen could not forbear
sometimes betraying her impatience, by interrupting
the preacher; and the dean, finding that he had pro∣fited
nothing by his lecture, at last bid her change her
opinion, repent her of her former wickedness, and
settle her faith upon this ground, that only in Christ
Jesus could she hope to be saved. She answered,
again and again, with great earnestness: “Trouble
“not yourself any more about the matter: For I was
born in this religion, I have lived in this religion,
and in this religion I am resolved to die.” Even the
two earls perceived, that it was fruitless to harrass her
any further with theological disputes; and they order∣ed
<PB N="329" REF="364"/>
the dean to desist from his unseasonable exhortati∣ons,
and to pray for her conversion. During the
dean's prayer, she employed herself in private devotion
from the office of the Virgin; and after he had finish∣ed,
she pronounced aloud some petitions in English,
for the afflicted church, for an end of her own trou∣bles,
for her son, and for Queen Elizabeth; and pray∣ed
God, that that princess might long prosper, and
be employed in his service. The earl of Kent observ∣ing,
that in her devotions she made frequent use of
the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her, for her
attachment to that popish trumpery, as he termed it;
and he exhorted her to have Christ in her heart, not in
her hand<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 15. Jebb, vol. II. p. 307, 491, 637.</NOTE>. She replied with presence of mind, that it
was difficult to hold such an object in her hand,
without feeling her heart touched with some com∣punction<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Jebb. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHE now began, with the aid of her two women,
to disrobe herself; and the executioner also lent his
hand, to assist them. She smiled, and said, that she
was not accustomed to undress herself before so large
a company, nor to be served by such valets. Her
servants, seeing her in this condition, ready to lay her
head upon the block, burst into tears and lamentati∣ons:
She turned about to them; put her finger upon
her lips, as a sign of imposing silence upon them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 307, 492.</NOTE>;
and having given them her blessing, desired them to
pray for her. One of her maids, whom she had ap∣pointed
for that purpose, covered her eyes with a
handkerchief; she laid herself down, without any sign
of fear or trepidation; and her head was severed from
her body at two strokes by the executioner. He in∣stantly
held it up to the spectators, streaming with
blood and agitated with the convulsions of death:

The dean of Peterborow alone exclaimed, “So
perish all Queen Elizabeth's enemies”: The earl
of Kent alone reply'd “Amen: The attention
of all the other spectators was fixed on the melan∣choly
Scene before them; and zeal and flattery alike
gave place to present pity and admiration of the ex∣piring
Princess.</P>
<P>THUS died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary's cha∣racter.</NOTE> in the forty fifth year of her age, and
the nineteenth of her captivity in England, Mary
Queen of Scots; a princess of great accomplishments
both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but
unfortunate in her life, and during one period, very
unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her person,
and graces of her air, combined to make her the most
amiable of women; and the charms of her address
and conversation aided the impression which her lovely
figure made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambi∣tious
and active in her temper, yet inclined to chear∣fulness
and society; of a lofty spirit, constant and even
vehement in her purpose; yet polite, and gentle, and
affable in her demeanor; she seemed to partake only
so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable,
without relinquishing those soft graces which compose
the proper ornaments of her sex. In order to form a just
idea of her character, we must set aside one part of her
conduct, while she abandoned herself to the guidance
of a profligate man; and must consider these faults,
whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes,
as the result of an inexplicable, tho' not uncommon,
inconstancy in the human mind, of the frailty of our
nature, of the violence of passion, and of the influence,
which situations, and sometimes momentary incidents,
have on persons, whose principles are not throughly
confirmed by experience and reflection. Enraged by
the ungrateful conduct of her husband, seduced by the
treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed con∣fidence,
<PB N="331" REF="368"/>
transported by the violence of her own tem∣per,
which never lay sufficiently under the guidance
of discretion; she was betrayed into actions, which
may, with some difficulty, be accounted for, but which
admit of no apology, nor even of alleviation. An
enumeration of her qualities might carry the appear∣ance
of a panegyric; an account of her conduct must,
in some parts, wear the aspect of a severe satire and
invective.</P>
<P>HER numerous misfortunes, the solitude of her
long and tedious captivity, and the persecutions to
which she had been exposed on account of her religi∣on,
had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during
her latter years; and such was the prevalent spirit and
principles of that age, that it is the less wonder, if her
zeal, her resentment, and her interest uniting, induced
her to give consent to a design, which conspirators,
actuated only by the first of these motives, had formed
against the life of Elizabeth.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen heard of Mary's execution, she
affected the utmost surprize and indignation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's affected sor∣row.</NOTE> Her
countenance changed, her speech faltered and failed
her, and for a long time, her sorrow was so deep that
she could not express it, but stood fixed, like a statue,
in silence and mute astonishment. After her grief was
able to find vent, it burst out in loud wailings and
lamentations; she put herself into deep mourning for
this deplorable event; and she was seen perpetually
bathed in tears, and surrounded only by her maids
and women. None of her ministers or councellors
dared to approach her; or if any assumed such temeri∣ty,
she chaced them from her, with the most violent
expressions of rage and resentment: They had all of
them been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in put∣ting
to death her dear sister and kinswoman, con∣trary
<PB N="332" REF="369"/>
to her fixed purpose and intention<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 536. Strype, vol. III. Appendix, p. 145. Jebb, vol. II. p. 608.</NOTE>, of which
they were sufficiently apprized and acquainted.</P>
<P>No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to
leave room for reflexion, than she wrote a letter of
apology to the King of Scots, and sent it by Sir
Robert Cary, son to lord Hunsdon. She there told him,
that she wished he knew, but not felt, the unutterable
grief of mind, she experienced, on account of that la∣mentable
accident, which, without her knowledge,
much less concurrence, had happened in England:
That as her pen trembled, when she attempted to
write it, she found herself obliged to commit the re∣lation
of it to the messenger, her kinsman; who would
likewise inform his majesty of every circumstance,
which attended this dismal and unlooked for misfor∣tune:
That she appealed to the Supreme Judge of
heaven and earth for her innocence; and was also so
happy, amidst her other afflictions, as to find, that
many persons in her court could bear witness to her
veracity in this protestation: That she abhorred hy∣pocrisy
and dissimulation, deemed nothing more wor∣thy
of a prince than a sincere and open conduct, and
could never surely be esteemed so base and poor-spirited,
as that, if she had really given orders for this fatal
execution, she could, on any consideration, be induc∣ed
to deny them: That tho' she was sensible of the
justice of the sentence, she determined from clemen∣cy
never to carry it into execution; and could not
but resent the temerity of those, who on this occasion
had disappointed her intention: And that as no one
loved him more dearly than herself, or bore a more
anxious concern for his welfare; she hoped, that he
would consider every one as his enemy, who endea∣voured,
on account of the present incident, to excite
any animosity between them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 536. Spotswood, p. 358.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="370"/>
IN order the better to appease James, she commit∣ted
Davison to prison, and ordered him to be tried in
the Star-Chamber, for his misdemeanour. The secre∣tary
was confounded; and being sensible of the danger,
which must attend his entering into a contest with
the Queen, he expressed penitence for his error, and
submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very
counsellors, whose persuasion had induced him to in∣cur
the guilt, and who had promised to countenance
and protect him. He was condemned to imprison∣ment
during the Queen's pleasure, and to pay a fine
of ten thousand pounds. He remained a long time
in custody; and the fine, tho' it reduced him to want
and beggary, was rigorously levied upon him. All
the favour, which he could obtain from the Queen,
was the sending him small supplies from time to time,
to keep him from perishing in necessity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538.</NOTE>. He privately
wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham, which
contains many curious particulars: The French and
Scots ambassadors, he said, had been remonstrating
with the Queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately
after their departure, she commanded him, of her own
accord, to deliver her the warrant for the execution of
that princess. She signed it readily and ordered it to
be sealed with the great seal of England. She appeared
in such good humour on the occasion, that she said to
him in a jocular manner, “Go tell all this to Wal∣singham,
who is now sick: Tho' I fear he will die
for sorrow, when he hears it.” She added, that,
tho' she had so long delayed the execution, lest she
should seem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, she
was all along sensible of the necessity of it. In the
same conversation, she blamed Drury and Paulet, that
they had not before eased her of this trouble; and she
expressed her desire that Walsingham would bring them
<PB N="334" REF="371"/>
to a compliance in that particular. She was so bent on
this purpose that, some time after, she asked Davison,
whether any letter had come from Paulet with regard
to the service expected of him. Davison showed her
Paulet's letter; in which that gentleman flatly refused
to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of
honour and justice. The Queen fell into a passion,
and accused Paulet, as well as Drury, of perjury,
that, having taken the oath of association, in which they
had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs, they had
yet refused to lend their hand on this occasion. “But
others,” she said, “will be found less scrupulous.”
Davison adds, that nothing but the consent and ex∣hortations
of the whole council could have engaged
him to send off the warrant. He was well aware of his
danger; and remembered, that the Queen, after having
ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had
endeavoured, in like manner, to throw the whole
blame and odium of that action upon lord Burleigh<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538. Strype, vol. III. p. 375, 376. MS. in the Ad∣vocate's library, A. 3. 28. p. 17. from the Cott. Lib. Calig. c. 9. Biogr. Brit. p. 1625, 1627.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH'S dissimulation was so gross, that it could
deceive no body who was not previously resolved to
be blinded; but as James's concern for this mother
was certainly more sincere and cordial, he discovered
the highest resentment, and refused to admit Cary into
his presence. He recalled his ambassadors from Eng∣land;
and seemed to breathe nothing but war and ven∣geance.
The States of Scotland, being assembled,
entered into the quarrel, and professed that they were
ready to spend their lives and fortunes in revenge of his
mother's death, and in defence of his title to the crown
of England. Many of his nobility instigated him
to take arms: Lord Sinclair, when the courtiers ap∣peared
in deep mourning, presented himself to the King
arrayed in compleat armour, and said, that that was
<PB N="335" REF="372"/>
the proper mourning for the Queen. The catholics
took the opportunity of exhorting James to ally him∣self
with the King of Spain, to lay immediate claim
to the crown of England, and to prevent the danger,
which, from his mother's example, he might conclude,
would certainly, if Elizabeth's power prevailed, over∣whelm
his person and his kingdom. The Queen was
sensible of the danger attending these counsels; and,
after allowing James some decent interval to vent his
grief and anger, she employed her emissaries to pacify
him, and to set before him every motive of hope or
fear, which might induce him to live in peace and
friendship with her.</P>
<P>WALSINGHAM wrote to lord Thirlstone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th March.</NOTE> the Scots
secretary of state, a very judicious letter to the same
purpose. He said, that he was much surprized to hear
of the violent resolutions taken in Scotland, and of the
passion discovered by a prince of so much judgment and
temper as James: That a war, founded merely on the
principle of revenge, and that too on account of an act
of Justice, which necessity had extorted, would for ever
be exposed to blame, and could not be excused by any
principles of equity or reason: That if these views
were deemed less momentous among princes, policy and
interest ought certainly to be attended to; and these mo∣tives
did still more evidently oppose all thoughts of a
rupture with England, and all revival of exploded
claims and pretensions to the English throne: That the
inequality between the two kingdoms deprived James
of any hopes of success, if he trusted merely to the force
of his own state, and had no recourse to foreign powers
for assistance: That the objections, attending the in∣troduction
of succours from a more powerful monarch,
appeared so evident from all the transactions of history,
that they could not escape a person of the King's ex∣tensive
knowledge; but there were, in the present case,
<PB N="336" REF="373"/>
several peculiar circumstances, which ought for ever to
prevent him from having recourse to so dangerous an
expedient: That the French monarch, the antient ally
of Scotland, might willingly use the assistance of that
kingdom against England; but would be displeased to
see the union of these two crowns on the head of
James; an union, which would ever after exclude him
from all hopes of practicing that policy, formerly so
useful to France and so pernicious to the Scottish nati∣on:
That Henry, besides, infested with faction and do∣mestic
war, was not in a condition of supporting dis∣tant
allies; much less, would he undergo any hazard or
expence, in order to aggrandize a near kinsman to the
house of Guise, the most determined enemies of his re∣pose
and authority: That the extensive power and ex∣orbitant
ambition of the Spanish monarch rendered him
a still more dangerous ally to James; and as he evi∣dently
aspired to an universal monarchy in the west,
and had in particular advanced some claims on En∣gland,
as if he were descended from the house of Lan∣caster,
he was at the same time the common enemy of
all princes, who d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed maintain their liberty and in∣dependence;
and the immediate rival and competitor
of the King of Scots: That the Queen, by her own
naval power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and her alliance with the Hollanders,
would probably intercept all succours which might be
sent James from abroad, and be enabled to decide the
controversy in this island with the superior forces of
her own kingdom, opposed to those of Scotland: That
if the King revived his mother's pretensions to the
crown of England, he must also embrace her religion, by
which alone they could be justified; and must thereby
undergo the infamy of abandoning those principles, in
which he had been strictly educated, and to which he
had hitherto religiously adhered: That as he would, by
such an apostasy, totally alienate all the protestants in
<PB N="337" REF="374"/>
Scotland and England, he could never gain the confi∣dence
of the catholics, who would still entertain a very
reasonable doubt of his honour and sincerity: That by
advancing a present claim to the crown, he forfeited
the certain prospect of his succession; and revived that
national animosity, which the late peace and alliance
between the kingdoms had happily extinguished: That
the whole gentry and nobility of England had openly
declared themselves for the execution of the Queen of
Scots; and if James showed such violent resentment
against that act of justice, they would be obliged, for
their own security, to prevent for ever so implacable
and revenge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l a prince from ruling over them: And
that, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ever some persons might represent his honour
as engaged to seek vengeance for the present affront and
injury, the true honour of a prince consisted in wisdom
and moderation and justice, not in following the dic∣tates
of blind passion, or in pursuing revenge at the ex∣pence
of every motive and every interest<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 377. Spotswood.</NOTE>. These con∣siderations,
joined to the peace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unambitious tem∣per
of the young prince, pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver his resentment;
and he fell gradually into a good correspondence with
the court of England. It is probable, that the Queen's
chief object in her dissimulation with regard to the ex∣ecution
of Mary, was, that she might thereby afford
James a decent pretence for renewing his amity with
her, on which their mutual interests so much depend∣ed.</P>
<P>WHILE
Elizabeth ensured tranquillity from the at∣tempts
of her nearest neighbour, she was not negligent
of more distant dangers. Hearing that Philip, while
he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries,
which he received from the English, was secretly pre∣paring
a great navy to attack her; she sent Sir Francis
Drake with a fleet to intercept his supplies, to pillage
his coast, and to destroy his shipping. Drake carried

out four capital ships of the Queen's, and twenty-six,
great and small, with which the London merchants, in
hopes of sharing in the plunder, had supplied him. Ha∣ving
learned from two Dutch ships, which he met in
his passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drake de∣stroys the fleet at Ca∣diz.</NOTE> that a Spanish fleet, richly laden, was lying
at Cadiz, ready to set sail for Lisbon, the rendezvous
of the intended Armada; he bent his course to the for∣mer
harbour, and boldly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as well as fortunately, made
an attack on the enemy. He obliged six gallies, which
made head against him, to take shelter under the forts;
he burned about an hundred vessels, laden with am∣munition
and naval stores; and he destroyed a great
ship of the marquess of Santa Croce. Thence, he set
sail for Cape St. Vincent, and took by assault the cas∣tle
situated on that promontory, with three other strong
holds. He next insulted Lisbon; and finding, that the
merchants, who had engaged entirely in expectation
of profit, were discontented with these military enter∣prizes,
he set sail for the Tercera Islands, with an in∣tention
of lying in wait for a rich Carrack, which was
expected in these quarters. He was so fortunate as to
meet with his prize; and in this short expedition,
where the public bore so small a share, the adventurers
were encouraged to attempt farther enterprizes, the
English seamen learned to despise the great unwieldy
ships of the enemy, the naval preparations of Spain were
destroyed, the intended expedition against England was
retarded a twelvemonth, and the Queen had thereby
leizure to take more secure measures against that formi∣dable
invasion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 540. Sir William Monson's Naval Tracts in Churchill's Voyages, vol. III. p. 156.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS year Thomas Cavendish, a gentleman of De∣vonshire,
who had dissipated a good estate by living at
court, being resolved to repair his fortune at the ex∣pence
of the Spaniards, fitted out three ships at Ply∣mouth,
one of an hundred and twenty tons, another of
<PB N="339" REF="378"/>
sixty, and a third of forty; and with these small vessels
he adventured into the South Seas, and committed
great depredations on the Spaniards. He took nine∣teen
vessels, some of which were richly laden: and re∣turning
by the Cape of Good Hope, he came to Eng∣land,
and entered the river in a kind of triumph. His
mariners and soldiers were cloathed in Silk, his sails
were of damask, his top-sail cloth of gold; and his
prizes were esteemed the richest that ever had been
brought into England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE land enterprizes of the English were not, dur∣ing
this campaign, so advantageous or honourable to
the nation. The important place of Deventer was in∣trusted
by Leicester to William Stanley, with a garri∣son
of twelve hundred English; and this gentleman,
being a catholic, was alarmed with the discovery of
Babington's conspiracy, and became apprehensive, lest
every one of his religion should thenceforth be treated
with distrust in England. He entered into a correspon∣dence
with the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for
a sum of money, and engaged the whole garrison to
desert with him to the Spanish service. Roland York,
who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his
example; and the Hollanders, formerly disgusted with
Leicester, and suspicious of the English, broke out into
loud complaints against the improvidence, if not the
treachery of his administration. Soon after, he him∣self
arrived in the Low Countries; but his conduct was
no-wise calculated to give them satisfaction, or to re∣move
the suspicions, which they had entertained
against him. The prince of Parma having besieged
Sluys, he attempted to relieve the place, first by sea,
then by land; but failed in both enterprizes; and as he
ascribed his bad success to the ill behaviour of the Hol∣landers,
they were equally free in reflections upon his
conduct. The breach between them became wider

every day: They slighted his authority, opposed his
measures, and neglected his counsels; while he endea∣voured,
by an imperious behaviour, and by violence,
to recover that influence, which he had lost by his im∣prudent
and ill concerted measures. He was even
suspected by the Dutch of a design to usurp upon their
liberties; and the jealousy entertained against him, be∣gan
to extend towards the Queen herself. That prin∣cess
had made some advances towards a peace with
Spain: A congress had been opened at Bourbourg, a
village near Graveline: And tho' the two courts, es∣pecially
that of Spain, had no other intention than to
amuse each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mu∣tually
relax the preparations for defence or assault, the
Dutch, who were determined, on no condition, to re∣turn
under the Spanish yoke, became apprehensive lest
their liberty should be sacrificed to the political inter∣ests
of England<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part II. lib. 4. Strype, vol, IV, N<SUP>o</SUP> 246.</NOTE>. But the Queen, who knew the im∣portance
of her alliance with the states in the present
conjuncture, was resolved to give them entire satisfac∣tion
by recalling Leicester, and commanding him to re∣sign
his government. Maurice, son to the prince of
Orange, a youth of twenty years of age, was elected
by the states governor in his place; and Peregrine lord
Willoughby, was appointed by the Queen commander
of the English forces. The measures of these two ge∣nerals
were much retarded by the malignity of Leices∣ter,
who had left a faction behind him, and who still at∣tempted,
by means of his emissaries, to disturb all the
operations of the states. So soon as Elizabeth got in∣telligence
of these disorders, she took care to redress
them, and she obliged all the partizans of England to
fall into unanimity with prince Maurice<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 66.</NOTE>. But tho'
her good sense so far prevailed over her partiality to Lei∣cester,
she never could be made fully sensible of his vi∣ces
<PB N="341" REF="382"/>
and incapacity: The submissions, which he made
her, restored him to her wonted
favour; and the lord
Buckhurst, who had accused him of misconduct in Hol∣land,
lost for some time her confidence, and was even
committed to custody.</P>
<P>SIR Christopher Hatton was another favourite, who,
at this time, received some marks of her partiality. Tho'
he had never followed the profession of the law, he was
made chancellor in the place of Bromley, deceased; but
notwithstanding all the expectations and wishes of the
lawyers, he behaved in a manner not unworthy that
high station: His good natural capacity supplied the
place of experience and study; and his decisions were
not found deficient either in point of equity or judg∣ment.
His enemies had contributed to this promotion,
in hopes that his absence from court, while he attend∣ed
the business of chancery, would gradually estrange
him from the Queen, and give them an opportunity of
undermining him in her favour.</P>
<P>THESE little intrigues and cabals of the court were
silenced by the account, which came from all quarters,
of the vast preparations made by the Spaniards for the
invasion of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1588.</NOTE> and for the entire conquest of
that kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip pro∣jects the in∣vasion of En∣gland.</NOTE> Philip, tho' he had not yet declared
war, on account of the hostilities, which Elizabeth eve∣ry
where committed upon him, had long harboured a
secret and violent desire of revenge against her. His
ambition also and the hopes of extending his empire
were much encouraged by the present prosperous situ∣ation
of his affairs; by the conquest of Portugal, the
acquisition of the Indian commerce and settlements, and
the yearly importation of vast treasures from America.
The point on which he rested his highest glory, the
perpetual object of his policy, was to support orthodoxy
and exterminate heresy; and as the power and credit
of Elizabeth were the chief bulwark of the protestants,
he hoped, if he could subdue that princess, to acquire
<PB N="342" REF="383"/>
the eternal renown, of being able to reunite the whole
Christian world in the catholic communion. Above
all, his indignation against his revolted subjects in the
Netherlands, instigated him to attack the English, who
had encouraged that insurrection, and who, by their
near neighbourhood, were so well enabled to support the
Hollanders, that he could never hope to reduce these
rebels, while the power of that kingdom remained en∣tire
and unbroken. To subdue England seemed a ne∣cessary
preparative to the reestablishment of his autho∣rity
in the Netherlands; and notwithstanding all ap∣pearances,
the former was in itself, as a more important,
so a more easy, undertaking than the latter. That
kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries,
and was more exposed to invasion from that quarter;
after an enemy had once obtained entrance, it was nei∣ther
fortified by art nor nature; a long peace had de∣prived
it of all military discipline and experience; and
the catholics, in which it still abounded, would be rea∣dy,
it was hoped, to join any invader, who should free
them from those grievous persecutions, at present exer∣cised
against them, and revenge the death of the Queen
of Scots, on whom they had fixed all their affections.
The fate of England must be decided in one battle at
sea, and another at land; and what comparison between
the English and Spaniards, either in point of naval
force, or in the numbers, reputation, and veteran bra∣very
of their armies? Besides the acquisition of so great
a kingdom, success against England ensured the imme∣diate
subjection of the Hollanders, who, attacked on
every hand, and deprived of all support, must yield their
stubborn necks to that yoke, which they had so long
resisted. Happily this conquest, as it was of the ut∣most
importance to the grandeur of Spain, would not
at present be opposed by the jealousy of the neighbour∣ing
powers, naturally so much interested to prevent the
success of that enterprize. A truce was lately conclud∣ed
<PB N="343" REF="384"/>
with the Turks; the empire was in the hands of a
friend and near ally; and France, the perpetual rival
of Spain, was so torn with intestine commotions, that
she had no leizure to pay attention to her foreign inter∣ests.
This favourable opportunity, therefore, which
might never again present itself, must be seized; and
one bold effort made for acquiring that ascendant in Eu∣rope,
to which the present greatness and prosperity of
the Spaniards seemed so fully to intitle them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden. Strype, vol. III. p. 512.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwith∣standing
his cautious temper, to undertake this hazard∣ous
enterprize; and tho' the duke of Parma, when
consulted, opposed the attempt, at least represented the
necessity of previously getting possession of some sea∣port
town in the Netherlands, which might afford a
retreat to the Spanish navy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part II. lib. 4.</NOTE>, it was determined by the
catholic monarch, to procced immediately to the exe∣cution
of his ambitious projects. During some time
he had been secretly making preparations; but so soon
as the resolution was fully taken, every part of his
vast empire resounded with noise of armaments, and
all his ministers, generals, and admirals, were employ∣ed
in forwarding the design.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The invinci∣ble Armada.</NOTE> The marquiss of Santa
Croce, a sea officer of great reputation and experience,
was destined to command the fleet; and by his counsel
were the naval equipments conducted. In all the ports
of Sicily, of Naples, of Spain and Portugal, artizans
were employed in building vessels of uncommon size
and force; naval stores were bought at a prodigious ex∣pence;
provisions amassed; armies levied and quartered
in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for
fitting out such a fleet and embarkation as had never
before had its equal in Europe. The military prepara∣tions
in Flanders were no less formidable. Troops
from all quarters were every moment assembling, to
reinforce the duke of Parma. Capizuchi and Spinelli,
<PB N="344" REF="385"/>
conducted forces from Italy: The marquess of Borgaut,
a prince of the house of Austria, levied troops in Ger∣many:
The Walloon and Burgundian regiments were
compleated or augmented: The Spanish infantry was
supplied with recruits; and an army of thirty four
thousand men were assembled in the Netherlands, and
kept in a readiness to be trasported into England. The
duke of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he
could procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Ger∣many,
and the coasts of the Baltic; and he built at
Dunkirk, and Newport, but especially at Antwerp,
a great number of boats and flat bottomed vessels, for
the transportation of his infantry and cavalry into
England. The most renowned nobility and princes of
Italy and Spain were ambitious of sharing in the honour
of this great enterprize. Don Amadaus of Savoy,
Don John of Medicis, Vespasian Gonzaga, duke of
Sabionetta, and the duke of Pastrana, hastened to join
the army under the duke of Parma. About two thou∣sand
volunteers, many of them men of family, had
inlisted in the service in Spain. No doubt was en∣tertained,
but such vast preparations, conducted by
officers of such consummate skill, must finally be suc∣cessful.
And the Spaniards, ostentatious of their
power, and elevated with vain hopes, had already deno∣minated
their navy the <HI>Invincible Armada.</HI></P>
<P>NEWS of these extraordinary preparations soon reach∣ed
England; and notwithstanding the secrecy of the
Spanish council, and their pretending to employ this
force in the Indies, it was easily concluded, that they
meant to make some effort against England. The
Queen had foreseen the invasion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations in England.</NOTE> and finding that
she must now contend for her crown with the whole
force of Spain, she made preparations for resistance;
nor was she terrified with that power, by which all
Europe apprehended she must of necessity be over∣whelmed.
Her force indeed seemed very unequal to
<PB N="345" REF="386"/>
resist so potent an enemy. All the sailors in England
amounted at that time only to fourteen thousand two
hundred and ninety-five men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 256.</NOTE>. The size of the English
shipping was, in general, so small, that, except a few
of the Queen's ships of war, there were not four vessels
belonging to the merchants which exceeded four hun∣dred
tuns<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 268.</NOTE>. The royal navy consisted only of twenty∣eight
vessels<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 157.</NOTE>, many of which were of very small size;
none of them exceeding the bulk of our largest frigates,
and most of them deserving rather the name of pinnaces
than of ships. The only advantage of the English fleet,
consisted in the dexterity and courage of the seamen,
who being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas, and
expose themselves to all dangers, as much exceeded
in this particular the Spanish mariners, as their vessels
were inferior in size and force to those of that nation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 321.</NOTE>.
All the commercial towns of England were required
to furnish ships for reinforcing this small navy; and
they discovered, on the present occasion, great alacrity
in defending their liberty and religion against those im∣minent
perils with which they were menaced. The
citizens of London, in order to shew their vigour in
the common cause, instead of fifteen vessels which they
were commanded to equip, voluntarily fitted out double
the number<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 267.</NOTE>. The gentry and nobility hired, and
armed, and manned, forty-three ships at their own
charge<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. 1. p. 451.</NOTE>; and all the loans of money which the Queen
demanded, were frankly granted by the persons appli∣ed
to. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of great
courage and capacity, was lord admiral, and took on
him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and
Frobisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe,
served under him. The main fleet was stationed at
Plymouth. A smaller squadron, consisting of forty
vessels, English and Flemish, was commanded by the
<PB N="346" REF="387"/>
lord Seymour, second son of protector Somerset; and lay
off Dunkirk, in order to intercept the duke of Parma.</P>
<P>THE land forces of England, compared to those of
Spain, possessed contrary qualities to its naval power:
They were more numerous than the enemy, but much
inferior in discipline, reputation, and experience. An
army of twenty thousand men was disposed in different
bodies along the south coast; and orders were given
them, if they could not hinder the Spaniards from land∣ing,
to retire backwards, to waste the country around,
and to wait for reinforcement from the neighbouring
counties, before they approached the enemy. A body
of twenty-two thousand foot, and a thousand horse,
under the command of the earl of Leicester, was
stationed at Tilbury, in order to defend the capital.
The main army, consisted of thirty-four thousand foot,
and two thousand horse, and was commanded by lord
Hunsdon. These forces were reserved for the guard
of the Queen's person; and were appointed to march
whithersoever the enemy should appear. The fate of
England, if all the Spanish armies should be able to
land, seemed to depend on the issue of a single battle;
and men of reflection entertained the most dismal ap∣prehensions,
when they considered the force of fifty
thousand veteran Spaniards, commanded by experien∣ced
officers, under the duke of Parma, the most con∣summate
general of the age; and compared this formid∣able
armament with the military power, which Eng∣land,
not enervated by peace, but long disused to war,
could muster up against it.</P>
<P>THE chief support of the kingdom seemed to con∣sist
in the vigour and prudence of the Queen's<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>con∣duct;
who, undismayed by the present dangers, issued
all her orders with tranquillity, animated her people
to a steddy resistance, and employed every resource,
which either her domestic situation or her foreign
alliances could afford her. She sent Sir Robert Sydney
<PB N="347" REF="388"/>
into Scotland; and exhorted the King to remain at∣tached
to her, and to consider the danger which at
present menaced his sovereignty no less than her own,
from the ambition of the Spanish tyrant<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">She made him some promises which she never fulfilled, to give him a dukedom in England, with suitable lands and revenue, to settle 50001. a year on him, and pay him a guard, for the safety of his person. From a MS. of lord Royston.</NOTE>: The ambas∣sador
found James sufficiently disposed to cultivate
an union with England, and he even kept himself pre∣pared
to march with the force of his whole kingdom
to the assistance of Elizabeth. Her authority with
the King of Denmark, and the tye of their common
religion, engaged this prince, upon her application,
to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had bought or
hired in the Danish harbours<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strype. vol. III. p. 524.</NOTE>: The Hanse Towns,
tho' not at that time on good terms with Elizabeth,
were induced by the same motives, to retard so long
the equipment of some vessels in their ports, that they
became useless to the purpose of invading England.
All the protestants throughout Europe, regarded this
enterprize as the critical event which was to decide
for ever the fate of their religion; and tho' unable, by
reason of their distance, to join their force to that
of Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her con∣duct
and fortune, and beheld with anxiety, mixed
with admiration, the interepid countenance with which
she encountered that dreadful tempest, which was every
moment approaching towards her.</P>
<P>THE Queen also was sensible, that, next to the gene∣ral
popularity which she enjoyed, and the confidence
which her subjects reposed in her prudent government,
the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general
zeal of the people for the protestant religion, and the
strong prejudices which they had imbibed against pope∣ry.
She took care, on this occasion, to revive in the
nation this attachment to their own sect, and this ab∣horrence
of the opposite. The English were remind∣ed
<PB N="348" REF="389"/>
of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain:
All the barbarities exercised by Mary against the pro∣testants,
were ascribed to the counsels of that bigotted
and imperious nations: The bloody massacres in the In∣dies,
the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries,
the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquisition,
were set before men's eyes: A list and description was
published, and pictures dispersed, of the several instru∣ments
of torture<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with which, it was pretended, the
Spanish Armada was loaded: And every artifice, as
well as reason, was employed, to animate the people to
a vigorous defence of their religion, their laws, and their
liberties.</P>
<P>BUT while the Queen, in this critical emergence,
rouzed the animosity of the nation against popery, she
treated the partizans of that sect with moderation, and
gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them.
Tho' she knew, that Sixtus Quintus, the present pope,
famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated
a new bull of excommunication against her, had depos∣ed
her from the throne, had absolved her subjects from
their oaths of allegiance, had published a crusade against
England, and had granted plenary indulgences to eve∣ry
one engaged in the present invasion; she would not
believe, that all her catholic subjects could be so blind∣ed,
as to sacrifice to bigotry their duty to their sove∣reign,
and the liberty and independency of their native
country. She rejected all violent counsels, by which
she was prompted to seek pretences for dispatching the
leaders of that party: She would not even confine any
considerable number of them: And the catholics, sen∣sible
of this good usage, generally expressed the highest
zeal for the public defence. Some gentlemen of that
sect, conscious that they could not justly expect any
trust or authority, entered themselves as volunteers in
the fleet or army<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 747.</NOTE>: Some equipped ships at their own
<PB N="349" REF="390"/>
charge, and gave the command of them to protestants:
Others were active in animating their tenants and vas∣sals,
and neighbours, to the defence of their country:
And every rank of men, burying for the present all par∣ty
distinctions, seemed to prepare themselves, with or∣der
as well as vigour, to resist the violence of these in∣vaders.</P>
<P>THE
more to excite the martial spirit of the nation,
the Queen appeared on horseback in the camp at Til∣bury;
and riding thro' the lines, discovered a chearful
and animated countenance, exhorted the soldiers to re∣member
their duty to their country and their religion,
and professed her intention, tho' a woman, to lead them
herself into the field against the enemy, and rather to
perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of her
people<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Queen's speech in the camp of Tilbury was in these words:</HI> My loving people, We have been persuaded by some, that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes, for fear of treachery; but assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear: I have always so behaved myself, that, under God, I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good-will of my subjects. And therefore I am come amongst you at this time, not as for my recreation or sport, but being resolved in the midst and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of the battle to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honour and my blood, even in the dust. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble-woman, but I have the heart of a King, and of a King of England too; and think foul scorn, that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms: To which, rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms; I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. I know already, by your forwardness, that you have deserved rewards and crowns; and we do assure you, on the word of a prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the mean time, my lieutenant general shall be in my stead; than whom never prince commanded more noble and worthy subject; not doubting, by your obedience to my general, by your concord in the camp, and your valour in the field, we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my God, of my kingdom, and of my people.</NOTE>. By this spirited behaviour she revived the
tenderness and admiration of the soldiery: An attach∣ment
to her person became a species of enthusiasm among
<PB N="350" REF="391"/>
them: And they asked one another, whether it were
possible that Englishmen could abandon this glorious
cause, could display less courage than appeared in the
female sex, or could ever, by any dangers, be induced
to relinquish the defence of their heroic princess.</P>
<P>THE Spanish Armada was ready in the beginning of
May; but the moment it was preparing to sail, the
marquess of Santa Croce, the admiral, was seized with
a violent fever, of which he soon after died. The vice∣admiral,
the duke of Paliano, by a strange concurrence
of accident, at the very same time, suffered the same
fate; and the King appointed for admiral the duke of
Medina Sidonia, a nobleman of the greatest family
in Spain, but unexperienced in action, and utterly
unacquainted with sea affairs. Alcarede was appoint∣ed
vice-admiral. This misfortune, besides the loss of
so great an officer as Santa Croce, retarded the sailing
of the Armada, and gave the English more time for
their preparations to oppose them. At last, the fleet,
full of hopes and alacrity, set sail from Lisbon; but
next day met with a violent tempest, which scattered the
ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> sunk some of the smallest, and forced the rest to
take shelter in the Groyne, where they waited till they
could be refitted. When news of this event was car∣ried
to England, the Queen concluded, that the design
of an invasion was disappointed for this summer; and
being always ready to lay hold of every pretence for
saving money, she made Walsingham write to the
admiral directing him to lay up some of the larger
ships, and to discharge the seamen: But lord Effing∣ham,
who was not so sanguine in his hopes, used the
freedom to disobey these orders; and he begged leave
to retain all the ships in service, tho' it should be at his
own expence<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 545.</NOTE>. He took advantage of a north wind,
and sailed towards the coast of Spain, with an inten∣tion
of attacking the enemy in their harbours; but the
<PB N="351" REF="392"/>
wind changing to the south, he became apprehensive,
lest they might have set sail, and by passing him at sea,
invade England, now exposed by the absence of the
fleet. He returned, therefore, with the utmost ex∣pedition
to Plymouth, and lay at anchor in that har∣bour.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE,
the Armada had repaired all her dama∣ges;
and with fresh hopes set out again to sea, in pro∣secution
of her enterprize. The fleet consisted of
a hundred and thirty vessels, of which near a hundred
were galleons, and were of greater size than any
which had ever before been used in Europe. It carried
on board nineteen thousand two hundred and ninety∣five
soldiers, eight thousand four hundred and fifty-six
mariners, two thousand and eighty-eight gally slaves,
and two thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces
of brass ordnance. It was victualled for six months;
and was attended with twenty lesser ships, called cara∣vals,
and ten salves with six oars apiece<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 221.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE plan formed by the King of Spain, was, that
the Armada should sail to the coast opposite to Dunkirk
and Newport; and having chased away all English or
Flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage, (for
it was never supposed they could make opposition)
should join themselves with the duke of Parma, should
thence make sail to the Thames, and having landed the
whole Spanish army, thus compleat at one blow the
entire conquest of England. In prosecution of this
plan, Philip gave orders to the duke of Medina, that,
in passing along the chanel, he should sail as near the
coast of France as he could with safety; that he should
by his policy avoid meeting with the English fleet;
and keeping in view the main enterprize, should neglect
all smaller successes, which might prove an obstacle,
or even interpose a delay, to the acquisition of a king∣dom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>57.</NOTE>. After the Armada was under sail, they took
<PB N="352" REF="393"/>
a fisherman, who informed them, that the English
admiral had been lately at sea, had heard of the tem∣pest
which scattered the Armada, had retired back into
Plymouth, and no longer expecting an invasion this
season, had laid up his ships, and discharged most of
the seamen. From this false intelligence the duke of
Medina conceived the great facility of attacking and
destroying the English ships in harbour; and he was
tempted, by the prospect of so decisive an enterprize,
to break his orders, and make sail directly for Ply∣mouth:
A resolution which proved the safety of Eng∣land.
The Lizard was the first land made by the
Armada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE> about sunset; and as the Spaniards took
it for the Ram-head near Plymouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arma∣da arrives in the Channel.</NOTE> they bore out
to sea, with an intention of returning nextday, and at∣tacking
the English navy. They were descried by Flem∣ing,
a Scotish pyrate, who was roving in these seas, and
who immediately set sail, to inform the English admiral
of their approach<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Monson. p. 158.</NOTE>: Another fortunate event, which
contributed extremely to the safety of the fleet. Effing∣ham
had just time to get out of port, when he saw
the Spanish Armada coming full sail towards him,
disposed in the form of a half-moon, and stretching
the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one
division to that of the other.</P>
<P>THE writers of that age raise their stile by a pom∣pous
description of this spectacle; the most magnifi∣cent
which had ever appeared upon the ocean, infus∣ing
equal terror and admiration into the minds of all
beholders. The lofty masts, the swelling sails, and
the towering prows of the Spanish galleons, seem
impossible to be justly painted, otherwise than by assum∣ing
the colours of poetry; and an eloquent historian
of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has asserted, that
the Armada, tho' the ships bore every sail, yet ad∣vanced
<PB N="353" REF="394"/>
with a slow motion; as if the ocean groaned
with supporting, and the winds were tired with impel∣ling,
so enormous a weight<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglia, part ii. lib. 4.</NOTE>. The truth, however,
is, the largest of the Spanish vessels would scarce pass
for third rates in the present navy of England; yet
were they so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ill framed, or so ill governed, that they
were quite unwieldy, and could not sail upon a wind,
nor tack on occasion, nor be managed in stormy
weather by the seamen. Neither the mechanics of
ship-building, nor the experience of mariners, had at∣tained
so great perfection as could serve fro the security
and government of such bulky vessels; and the Eng∣lish,
who had already had experience how unserviceable
they commonly were, were not dismayed with their
tremendous appearance.</P>
<P>EFFINGHAM gave orders, not to come to a close
fight with the Spaniards, where the size of the ships,
he suspected, and the numbers of the soldiers, would
be a disadvantage to the English; but to cannonade
them at a distance, and to wait the opportunity which
winds, currents, or various chances must afford them,
of intercepting some scattered vessels of the enemy.
Nor was it long before the event answered expectation.
A great ship of Biscay, on board of which was a consi∣derable
part of the Spanish money, was set on fire by
accident; and while all hands were employed in ex∣tinguishing
it, she fell behind the rest of the Armada:
The great galleon of Andaluzia was detained by the
springing of her mast: and both these vessels were
taken, after some resistance, by Sir Francis Drake.
As the Armada advanced up the channel, the English
hung upon the rear, and still infested them with skir∣mishes.
Each trial abated the confidence of the Spa∣niards,
and added courage to the English; and the
latter soon found, that even in close fight the size of
the Spanish ships was no advantage to them. Their
<PB N="354" REF="395"/>
bulk exposed them the more to the fire of the enemy;
while their cannon, placed too high, shot over the
heads of the English. The alarm having now reached
the coast of England, the nobility and gentry hastened
out with their vessels from every harbour, and rein∣forced
the admiral. The earls of Oxford, Northum∣berland,
and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir
Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavasor,
Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount; with many
others, distinguished themselves by this generous and
disinterested service of their country. The English
fleet, after the conjunction of these ships, amounted to
an hundred and forty sail.</P>
<P>THE Armada had now reached Calais, and cast
anchor before that place, in expectation, that the
duke of Parma, who had got intelligence of their ap∣proach,
would put to sea, and join his forces to them.
The English admiral practised here a very successful
stratagem upon the Spaniards. He took eight of his
smaller ships, and filling them with all combustible
materials, sent them, one after another, into the midst
of the enemy. The Spaniards fancied, that they were
fireships of the same contrivance with a famous vessel
which had lately done so much execution in the
Schelde near Antwerp; and they immediately cut their
cables, and took to flight with the greatest disorder
and precipitation. The English fell upon them next
morning, while in confusion; and besides doing great
damage to other ships, they took or destroyed about
twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY this time, it was become apparent, that the inten∣tion,
for which these great preparations were made by
the Spaniards, was entirely frustrated. The vessels,
provided by the duke of Parma, were made for trans∣porting
soldiers not for fighting; and that general,
when urged to leave the harbour, utterly refused to ex∣pose
his flourishing army to such apparent hazard, as
<PB N="355" REF="396"/>
it must incur; while the English, not only were able
to keep the sea, but seemed even to triumph over
their enemy. The Spanish admiral found, in many
rencounters, that while he lost so considerable a part
of his own navy, he had destroyed only one small vessel
of the English; and he foresaw, that, by continuing
so unequal a combat, he must draw inevitable destruc∣tion
on all the remainder. He prepared therefore to
return homewards; but as the winds were contrary
to his passage thro' the channel, he resolved to sail
northwards, and making the tour of the whole island,
reach the Spanish harbours by the ocean. The English
fleet followed him during some time; and had not
their ammunition fallen short, by the negligence of the
offices in supplying them, they had obliged the whole
Armada to surrender at discretion. The duke of
Medina had once taken that resolution; but was di∣verted
from it by the advice of his confessor. This
conclusion of the enterprize would have been more
glorious to the English; but the event proved equally
fatal to the Spaniards. A violent tempest overtook
the Armada after it passed the Orkneys: The ships had
already lost their anchors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> and were obliged to keep
to sea: The mariners, unaccustomed to such hard∣ships,
and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels,
yielded to the fury of the storm, and allowed their
shipe to drive either on the western isles of Scot∣land,
or on the coast of Ireland, where they were mise∣rably
wrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to
Spain; and the seamen, as well as soldiers, who re∣mained,
were so overcome with hardship and fatigue,
so dispirited by their discomfiture, that they filled all
Spain with accounts of the valour of the English, and
of the tempestuous violence of that ocean which sur∣rounds
them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the miserable and dishonourable con∣clusion
of an enterprize, which had been preparing
<PB N="356" REF="397"/>
for three years, which had exhausted the revenue and
force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe
with anxiety or expectation. Philip, who was a slave
to his ambition, but had an entire command over his
countenance, no sooner heard of the mortifying event,
which blasted all his schemes, than he fell on his knees,
and rendering thanks for that gracious dispensation of
providence, expressed his joy that the calamity was not
greater. The Spanish priests, who had so often blest
this holy crusade, and foretold its infallible success,
were somewhat at a loss to account for the victory
gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated
heretics and an execrable usurper: But they at last dis∣covered,
that all the calamities of the Spaniards had
proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live
among them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 525. On the fourth of September, soon after the dispersion of the Spanish Armada, died the earl of Leicester, the Queen's great, but unworthy, favourite. Her affection to him continued to the last. He had discovered no conduct in any of his military enter∣prizes; and was suspected of cowardice: Yet she entrusted him with the command of her armies during the danger of the Spanish invasion; a par∣tiality, which might have proved fatal to her, had the duke of Parma been able to land his troops in England. She had even ordered a commission to be drawn for him, constituting him her lieutenant in the kingdoms of England and Ireland; but Burleigh and Hatton represented to her the danger of entrusting such unlimited authority in the hands of any subject, and prevented the execution of that design. No wonder, that a conduct, so unlike the usual jealousy of Elizabeth, gave reason to suspect, that her partiality was founded on some other passion than friendship. But Elizabeth seemed to carry her affection to Leicester no farther than the grave: She ordered his goods to be disposed of at a public sale, to reimburse herself of some money which he owed her; and her usual attention to money was observed to prevail over her regard to the memory of the deceased. This earl was a great hypocrite, a pretender to the strictest religion, an encoura∣ger of the puritans, and a founder of hospitals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOON after the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish Ar∣mada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.
D. 1589. 4th Februa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> the Queen summoned a new Parliament; and
received from them a supply of two subsidies and four
fifteenths payable in four years. This is the first in∣stance
that subsidies were doubled in one supply; and
<PB N="357" REF="398"/>
so unusual a concession was probably obtained form the
joy of the present success, and from the general sense
of the Queen's necessities. Some members objected
to this heavy charge, on account of the great bur∣then
of loans, which had lately been imposed upon
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 542. Id. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppen. p. 239. There are some singular passages in this last speech, which may be worth taking notice of; especial∣ly as they came from a member who was no courtier: For he argues against the subsidy. “And first,” says he, “for the <HI>necessity</HI> thereof, I cannot deny, but if it were a charge imposed upon us by her majesty's com∣mandment, or a demand proceeding from her majesty by way of request, that I think there is not one among us all, either so disobedient a sub∣ject in regard of our duty, or so unthankful a man in respect of the inesti∣mable benefits which, by her or from her, we have received, which would not with frank consent, both of voice and heart, most willingly submit himself thereunto, without any unreverend enquiry into the causes thereof. For it is continually in the mouth of us all, that our lands, goods, and lives are at our prince's disposing. And it agreeth very well with that position of the civil law, which sayeth, <HI>Quod omnia regis sunt.</HI> But how? <HI>Ita tamen, ut omnium sint. Ad regem enim potestas omnium per∣tinet; ad singulos proprietas.</HI> So that altho' it be most true, that her majesty hath over ourselves and our goods, <HI>potestatem imperandi;</HI> yet it is true, that until that power command (which, no doubt, will not command without very just cause) every subject hath his own <HI>proprieta∣tem possidendi.</HI> Which power and commadment form her majesty, which we have not yet received, I take it (saving reformation) that we are freed from the cause of <HI>necessity.</HI> And the cause of necessity, is the dangerous estate of the common wealth, &amp;c.” The tenor of the speech pleads rather for a general benevolence than a subsidy: For the law of Richard the third against benevolence was never conceived to have any force. The member even proceeds to assert, with some precaution, that it was in the power of a Parliament to refuse the King's demand of a subsidy. And that there was an instance of that liberty in Henry the third's time near four hundred years before. <HI>Sub sine.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH foresaw, that this house of commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
like all the foregoing, would be governed by the puri∣tans;
and therefore, to obviate their enterprizes, she
renewed, at the beginning of the session, her usual in∣junction,
that the parliament should not, on any ac∣count,
presume to treat of matters ecclesiastical. Not∣withstanding
this strict inhibition, the zeal of one
Damport moved him to present a bill to the commons
<PB N="358" REF="399"/>
for remedying the grievances, and restraining the ty∣ranny,
of the ecclesiastical commission, which were cer∣tainly
enormous: But when Mr. secretary Woley re∣minded
the house of her majesty's commands, no one
durst second the motion; the bill was not so much as
read; and the speaker returned it back to Damport,
without taking the least notice of it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 438.</NOTE>. Some mem∣bers
of the house, notwithstanding the general submis∣sion,
were even committed to custody on account of
this attempt<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, p. 280. Neal, vol. I. p. 500.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still
more clearly in another parliamentary transaction.
The right of purveyance was an antient prerogative,
by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take
provisions for the houshold from all the neighbouring
counties, and could make use of carts and carriages;
and the price of these services was fixed and stated.
The payment of the money was often distant and un∣certain;
and the rates were always much inferior to
the market price; so that purveyance, besides the sla∣very
of it, was always regarded as a great burthen, and
being arbitrary and casual, was liable to great abuses.
We may fairly presume, that the hungry courtiers of
Elizabeth, supported by her unlimited power, would
be sure to render this prerogative very oppressive to the
people; and the commons had, last session, found it
necessary to pass a bill for regulating these exac∣tions:
But the bill was lost in the house of peers<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 434.</NOTE>.
The continuance of the abuses begot a new attempt
for redress; and the same bill was now revived, and
sent up again to the house of peers, together with a
bill for some new regulations in the court of Exche∣quer.
Soon after, the commons received a message
from the upper house, desiring them to appoint a com∣mittee
for a conference. At this conference, the peers
<PB N="359" REF="400"/>
informed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1589.</NOTE> that the Queen, by a message, deliver∣ed
by lord Burleigh, had expressed her displeasure,
that the commons should presume to touch on her pre∣rogative.
If their were any abuses, she said, either in
imposing purveyance, or in the practice of the court of
Exchequer, her majesty was both able and willing to
provide due reformation; but would not permit the
Parliament to intermeddle in these matters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 440.</NOTE>. The
commons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed a
new committee to attend the Queen, and endeavour
to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful intentions.
Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee:
She expressed her great <HI>inestimable loving care</HI> towards
her loving subjects; which, she said, was greater than of
her own self, or even than any of them could have of
themselves. She told them, that she had already given
orders for an enquiry into the abuses attending pur∣veyance,
but the dangers of the Spanish invasion had
retarded the progress of that design; that she had as
much skill, will, and power to rule her own household
as any subjects whatsoever to govern theirs, and needed
as little the assistance of her neighbours; that the Ex∣chequer
was her chamber, consequently more near to
her than even her houshold, and therefore the less pro∣per
for them to intermeddle with; and that she would
of herself, with the advice of her council and the judges,
redress every grievance in these matters, but would not
permit <HI>them,</HI> by laws moved without her privity, to
bereave her of the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour attending these regulations<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 444.</NOTE>.
The issue of this matter was the same that attended
all contests between Elizabeth and her Parliaments<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Si rixa est, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bi tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum. <HI>Juven.</HI></NOTE>.
She seems even to have been more imperious, in this
particular, than her predecessors; at least, her more
remote ones: For they often permitted the abuses of
<PB N="360" REF="401"/>
purveyance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>We may judge of the extent and importance of these abuses by a speech of Bacon's against purveyors, delivered in the first Session of the first Par∣liament of the subsequent reign. “First,” says he, “they take in hand what they ought not to take; secondly, they take in quantity a far greater proportion than cometh so your majesty's use; thirdly, they take in an unlawful manner, in a manner, I say, directly and expressly pro∣hibited by several laws. For the first, I am a little to alter their name: For instead of takers, they become taxers: Instead of taking provisions for your majesty's service, they tax your people <HI>ad redimendam vexatio∣nem;</HI> imposing upon them and extorting from them divers sums of mo∣ney, sometimes in gross, sometimes in the nature of stipends annually paid, <HI>ne noceant,</HI> to be freed and eased of their oppression. Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber trees, which are the beauty, countenance and shelter of men's houses; that men have long spared from their own purse and profit; that men esteem, for their use and delight, above ten times the value; that are a loss which men can∣not repair or recover. These do they take, to the defacing and spoiling of your subjects mansions and dwellings, except they may be com∣pounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiff or a servant remaining, and put the ax to the root of the tree, ere ever the master can stop it. Again, they use a strange and most unjust exaction in causing the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due from your majesty unto them: So as a poor man, when he has had his hay or his wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had for the provision of his own family and not to put to sale) taken from him, and that not at a just price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his money, he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for poundage of his due pay∣ment upon so hard conditions. Nay farther they are grown to that extremity (as is affirmed, tho' it be scarce credible, save that in such persons all things are credible) that they will take double poundage, once when the debenture is made, and again the second time, when the money is paid. For the second point, most gracious sovereign, touching the quantity which they take far above that which is answered to your majesty's use; it is affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may safely avouch unto your majesty, that there is no pound profit, which redoundeth unto your majesty in this course but induceth and begetteth three pound damage upon your subjects, beside the discontentment. And to the end they may make their spoi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more securely, what do they? Whereas divers statutes do strictly provide, that whatsoever they take shall be registered and attested, to the the end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country and that which is answered above, their deceits might appear, they, to the end to obscure their deceits, utterly omit the observation of this, which the law prescribeth. And therefore to descend, if it may please your majesty, to the third sort of abuse, which is of the unlaw∣ful manner of their taking, whereof this question is a branch; it is so manifold, as it rather asketh an enumeration of some of the particulars than a prosecution of all. For their price, by law they ought to take as they can agree with the subject; by abuse they take at an imposed and enforced price: By law they ought to make but one apprizement by neighbours in the country; by abuse, they make a second apprizement at the court gate, and when the subjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of plight by reason of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated price: By law, they ought to take between sun and sun; by abuse, they take by twilight and in the night-time, a time well chosen for malefactors: By law, they ought not to take in the high-ways (a place by her majesty's high prerogative protected, and by statute by special words excepted) by abuse, they take in the high-ways: By law, they ought to shew their commission, &amp;c. A number of other particulars there are, &amp;c.” Bacon's works, vol. IV. p. 305, 306.</P>
<P>Such were the abuses, which Elizabeth would neither permit her Parlia∣ments to meddle with, nor redress herself. I believe it will readily be allowed, that this slight prerogative alone, which has passed almost unob∣served amidst other branches of so much greater importance, was sufficient to extinguish all regular liberty. For what elector, or member of Parlia∣ment, or even juryman, durst oppose the will of the court, while he lay un∣der the lash of such an arbitrary prerogative? For a farther account of the grievous and incredible oppressions of purveyors, see the journals of the house of commons, vol. I. p. 190. There is a story of a carter, which may be worth mentioning on this occasion. “A carter had three times been at Windsor with his cart to carry away, upon summons of a remove, some part of the stuff of her majesty's wardrobe; and when he had repair∣ed thither once, twice, and the third time, and that they of the wardrobe had told him the third time that the remove held not, the carter, clap∣ping his hand on his thigh, said, <HI>Now I see, that the Queen is a woman as well as my wife.</HI> Which words being overheared by her majesty, who then stood at the window, she said, <HI>What a villain is this?</HI> and so sent him three angels to stop his mouth.

In so great awe did the commons stand of every cour∣tier,

<P>THE discomfiture of the Armada had begot in the
nation a kind of enthusiastic passion for enterprizes
against Spain; and nothing seemed now impossible to
be atchieved by the valour and fortune of the English.
Don Antonio, prior of Crato, was a natural son of the
royal family of Portugal, who, trusting to the aversion
of his countrymen against the Castilians, had advanced
a claim to the crown, and flying first to France, thence
to England, had been encouraged both by Henry and
Elizabeth in his pretensions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition against Por∣tugal.</NOTE> A design was formed by
the people, not the court, of England to conquer the
kingdom for Don Antonio: Sir Francis Drake and
Sir John Norris were the leaders of this romantic en∣terprize:
Near twenty thousand voluntiers<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth, vol. I. p. 61. Monson, p. 267, says, that there were only fourteen thousand soldiers and four thousand sea∣men in the whole on this expedition: But the account contained in Dr. Birch, is given by one of the most considerable of the adventurers.</NOTE> inlisted
themselves in the service: And ships were hired, as well
as arms provided, at the sole charge of the adventurers.
The Queen's frugality kept her from contributing
more than sixty thousand pounds to the expence; and
she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the
expedition<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 267.</NOTE> There was more spirit and bravery, than
foresight or prudence, in the conduct of this enterprize.
The small stock of the adventurers could not enable
them to buy either provisions or ammunition sufficient
<PB N="363" REF="406"/>
for such an undertaking: They even wanted vessels to
stow the numerous voluntiers, who crowded to them;
and they were obliged to seize by force someships of
the Hanse Towns, which they met with at sea: An ex∣pedient,
which set them some what more at ease in point
of room for their men, but remedied not the deficien∣cy
of their provisions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 159.</NOTE>. Had they sailed directly to
Portugal, it is believed, that the good will of the peo∣ple,
joined to the defenceless state of the kingdom,
might have ensured them of success: But hearing, that
great preparations were making at the Groine, for the
invasion of England, they were induced to go thither,
and destroy this new armament of Spain. They broke
into the harbour; burned some ships of war, particu∣larly
one commanded by Recalde, vice admiral of Spain;
they defeated an army of four or five thousand men,
which was assembled to oppose them; they assaulted
the Groine, and took the lower town, which they pil∣laged;
and they would have taken the higher, tho' well
fortified, had they not found their ammunition and pro∣visions
beginning to fall short. The young earl of
Essex, a nobleman of very promising hopes, who, fired
with the thirst of military honour, had secretly, un∣known
to the Queen, stole from England, here join∣ed
the adventurers; and it was then agreed by com∣mon
consent to make sail for Portugal, the main object
of their enterprize.</P>
<P>THE English landed at Paniche, a sea-port town,
twelve leagues from Lisbon; and Norris led the army
to that capital, while Drake undertook to sail up the
river, and attack the city with united forces. By this
time, the court of Spain had got leizure to prepare
against the invasion of the English. Forces were
thrown into Lisbon: The Portuguese were disarmed:
All suspected persons were taken into custody: And thus,
tho' the inhabitants bore great affection to Don An∣tonio,
<PB N="364" REF="407"/>
none of them dared to declare in favour of the
invaders. The English army, however, made them∣selves
masters of the suburbs, which abounded with
riches of all kinds; but as they desired to conciliate the
affections of the Portugueze, and were more intent on
honour than profit, they observed a strict discipline,
and abstained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found
their ammunition and provisions totally exhausted;
they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the
walls; the admiral had not been able to pass some for∣tresses,
which guarded the river; there was no appear∣ance
of any insurrection in their favour; sickness from
fatigue, hunger, and intemperance in wine and fruits
had seized the army: So that it was found requisite to
make all haste possible to reimbark. They were not
pursued by the enemy; and finding, at the mouth of
the river, sixty ships laden with naval stores, they sei∣zed
them as lawful prize; tho' they belonged to the
Hanse Towns, a neutral power. They sailed thence
to Vigo, which they took and burned; and having
ravaged the country round, they set sail and arrived
safely in England. Above the half of these gallant ad∣venturers
perished by sickness, famine, fatigue, and
the sword<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; and England reaped much more honour
than profit from this extraordinary expedition. It is
computed, that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked
on board this fleet, and that only three hundred and
fifty survived these multiplied disasters<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Birch, Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN these ships were on their voyage homewards,
they met with the earl of Cumberland, who was out∣ward
bound, with a fleet of seven sail, all equipped at
his own charge, except one ship of war, which the
Queen had lent him. That nobleman supplied Sir
Francis Drake with some provisions; a generosity,
which saved the lives of many of Drake's men, but
which the others suffered severely for afterwards.
<PB N="365" REF="408"/>
Cumberland sailed towards the Terceras, and took se∣veral
prizes from the enemy; but the richest, valued at
an hundred thousand pounds, perished in her return,
with all her cargo, near St. Michael's Mount in Corn∣wal.
Many of these adventurers were killed in a rash
attempt at the Terceras: A destructive mortality sei∣zed
the rest: And it was with difficulty that the few
hands, which remained, were able to steer the ships
home into harbour<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the signal advantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> gained over the Spani∣ards,
and the spirit, which they infused into the En∣glish,
gave Elizabeth great security during the rest of
her reign, she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye
on Scotland, whose situation rendered the revolutions
of that kingdom always of importance to her. It might
have been expected, that this high-spirited princess,
who knew so well how to brave danger, would not
have retained that suspicious jealousy towards Scotland,
with which, during the life-time of Mary, she had been
so much agitated. James had indeed succeeded to all
his mother's claims; but he had not succeeded to the
favour of the catholics, which could alone render these
claims dangerous<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 51.</NOTE>: And as the Queen was now well
advanced in years, and enjoyed the most uncontrouled
authority over her subjects, it was not likely, that the
King of Scots, who was of an indolent unambitious
temper, would ever give her any disturbance in the
possession of her throne. Yet all these circumstances
could not remove her timorous suspicions: And so far
from satisfying the nation by a settlement of the suc∣cession,
or a declaration of James's title, she was as
anxious to prevent every incident, which might raise
his credit or procure him the regard of the English, as
if he had been her immediate rival and competitor.
Most of his ministers and favourites were her pension∣ers;
and as she was desirous to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der him from marry∣ing
<PB N="366" REF="409"/>
and having children, she obliged them to throw
obstacles in the way of their alliance, even the most
reasonable, which could be offered him; and during
some years, she succeeded in this malignant policy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 166, 177.</NOTE>.
He had fixed on the eldest daughter of the King of
Denmark, who being a remote prince and not very
powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did she so
artfully cross this negotiation, that the Danish monarch,
impatient of delay, married his daughter to the Duke
of Brunswic. James then renewed his suit to the
younger princess; and still found obstacles from the in∣trigues
of Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of in∣terposing
delay, proposed to him the sister of the King
of Navarre, a princess much older than himself, and en∣tirely
destitute of fortune. The young King, besides
the desire of securing himself by the prospect of issue,
from those traiterous attempts, too frequent among his
subjects, had been so watched by the rigid austerity of
the ecclesiastics, that he had another inducement to
marriage, which is not so usual with monarchs. His
impatience therefore broke thro' all the politics of
Elizabeth: The articles of marriage were settled: The
ceremony was performed by proxy: And the princess
embarked for Scotland; but was drove by a storm into
a port of Norway. This tempest, and some others,
which happened near the same time, were universally
believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded
from a combination of the Scottish and Danish witch∣es;
and the dying confession of the criminals was sup∣posed
to place the accusation beyond all controversy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 180.</NOTE>.
James, however, tho' a great believer in sorcery, was
not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage, in
order to conduct his bride home: He arrived in Nor∣way;
carried the Queen thence to Copenhagen; and
having passed the winter in that city, he brought her
next spring to Scotland, where they were joyfully re∣ceived
<PB N="367" REF="410"/>
by the people. The clergy alone, who never
neglected an opportunity of vexing him, made opposi∣tion
to the Queen's coronation, on account of the
ceremony of anointing her, which, they alledged, was
either a Jewish or a popish rite; and therefore utterly
antichristian and unlawful. But James was as much
bent on the ceremony, as they were averse to it; and
after much controversy and many intrigues, his autho∣rity,
which had not often happened, at last prevailed
over their opposition<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 381.</NOTE>.

<P>AFTER a state of great anxiety and many difficul∣ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIII.</NOTE> Elizabeth had at length reached a situation,
where, tho' her affairs still required attention, and
found employment for her active temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1590.</NOTE> she was re∣moved
from all danger of any immediate revolution,
and might regard the efforts of her enemies with some
degree of confidence and security. Her successful and
prudent administration had gained her, together with
the admiration of foreigners, the affections of her
own subjects; and after the death of the Queen of Scots,
even the catholics, however discontented, pretended
not to dispute her title, or adhere to any other person
as her rival and competitor. James, curbed by his fac∣tious
nobility and ecclesiastics, possessed at home very
little authority; and was sollicitous to remain on good
terms with Elizabeth and the English nation, in hopes
that time, aided by his patient tranquillity, would
secure him that rich succession, to which his birth en∣titled
him. The Hollanders, tho' overmatched in their
contest with Spain, still made an obstinate resistance;
and such was their unconquerable antipathy to their
old masters, and such the prudent conduct of young
Maurice, their governor, that the subduing that small
territory, if at all possible, must be the work of years,
and the result of many and great successes. Philip,
who, in his powerful effort against England, had been
<PB N="369" REF="414"/>
transported by resentment and ambition beyond his
usual cautious maxims, was now disabled, and still
more discouraged, from adventuring again on such ha∣zardous
enterprizes. The situation also of affairs in
France, began chiefly to employ his attention; but
notwithstanding all his artifice, and force, and expence,
the events in that kingdom proved every day more con∣trary
to his pretensions, and more favourable to the
friends and confederates of England.</P>
<P>THE violence of the League having constrained
Henry to declare war against the Hugonots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af∣fairs.</NOTE> these re∣ligionists
seemed exposed to the utmost danger; and
Elizabeth, sensible of the intimate connexion between
her own interests and those of that party, had supported
the King of Navarre by her negociations in Germany,
and still more by large sums of money, which she re∣mitted
for levying forces in that country. That heroic
prince, not discouraged by the great superiority of his
enemies, took the field; and in the year 1587 gained,
at Coutras, a compleat victory over the army of the
French King; but as his allies, the Germans, were
at the same time discomfited by the army of the League,
under the duke of Guise, his situation, notwithstand∣ing
his victory, seemed still as desperate as ever. The
chief advantage which he reaped from this diversity of
success, was the divisions which, by that means, took
place among his enemies. The inhabitants of Paris,
intoxicated with admiration of Guise, and strongly
prejudiced against their King, whose intentions had
become suspicious to them, took to arms, and obliged
Henry to fly for his safety. That prince, dissembling
his resentment, entered into a negociation with the
League; and having conferred many high offices on
Guise and his partizans, summoned an assembly of the
states at Blois, on pretence of finding means and ex∣pedients
to support the intended war agai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the Hu∣gonots.
The various scenes of perfidy and cruelty
<PB N="370" REF="415"/>
which had been exhibited in France, had justly begot a
mutual diffidence among all parties; yet Guise, trust∣ing
more to the timidity than honour of the King,
rashly put himself into the hands of that monarch,
and expected, by the ascendant of his own genius, to
make him submit to all his exorbitant pretensions.
Henry, tho' of an easy disposition, not steddy to his
resolutions, nor even to his promises, wanted neither
courage nor capacity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of Guise.</NOTE> and finding all his subtilties
eluded by the vigour of Guise, and even his throne
exposed to the most imminent danger, he embraced
more violent counsels than were natural to him, and
ordered that duke and his brother, the cardinal of Guise,
to be assassinated in his palace.</P>
<P>THIS cruel execution, which the necessity of it could
alone excuse, had nearly proved fatal to the author,
and seemed at first to plunge him into greater dangers
than those▪ which he sought to avoid, by taking ven∣geance
on his enemy. The partizans of the League
were enflamed with the utmost rage against him: The
populace every where, particularly at Paris, renounced
all allegiance to him: The ecclesiastics and the preach∣ers
filled all places with execrations against his name:
And the most powerful cities, and most opulent pro∣vinces,
appeared to combine in a resolution of renounc∣ing
monarchy, or of changing their monarch. Henry,
finding slender resources among his catholic subjects,
was constrained to enter into a confederacy with the
Hugonots and the King of Navarre: He enlisted large
bodies of Swiss infantry and German cavalry: And
being still supported by his chief nobility, he assembled,
by all these means, an army of near forty thousand
men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to crush
the League, and subdue all his enemies. The des∣perate
resolution of one man diverted the course of these
great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican monk,
inflamed by that bloody spirit of bigotry which distin∣guishes
<PB N="371" REF="416"/>
this century and a great part of the following
beyond all other ages of the world, embraced the re∣solution
of sacrificing his own life, in order to save the
church from the persecutions of an heretical tyrant;
and being admitted, under some pretext, to the King's
presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Henry the third.</NOTE> he gave that prince a mortal wound with
a knife, and was immediately put to death, by the
courtiers, who hastily revenged the murder of their
sovereign. This remarkable incident happened on the
first of August, 1589.</P>
<P>THE King of Navarre, next heir to the crown, as∣sumed
the government, under the title of Henry the
fourth; but succeeded to much greater difficulties than
those which surrounded his predecessor. The preju∣dices
entertained against his religion, made a great part
of the nobility desert him; and it was only by his pro∣mise
of hearkening to conferences and instruction, that
he could engage any of the catholics to adhere to his
undoubted title. The League, governed by duke of
Mayenne, brother to Guise, gathered new force; and
the King of Spain entertained views, either of dismem∣bering
the monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his
own dominions. In these distressful circumstances,
Henry addressed himself to Elizabeth, and found her
well disposed to contribute to his assistance, and to op∣pose
the progress of the catholic League, and of the
King of Spain, her inveterate and dangerous enemies.
To prevent the desertion of his Swiss and German
troops, she made him a present of twenty-two thousand
pounds; a larger sum than, as he declared, he had ever
seen before: And she sent him a reinforcement of four
thousand men, under lord Willoughby, an officer of
reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strength∣ened
by these supplies, Henry marched directly to
Paris; and having taken the suburbs, sword in hand,
he abandoned them to be pill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged by his soldiers. He
employed this body of English troops in many other
<PB N="370" REF="417"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="371" REF="418"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="372" REF="419"/>
enterprizes; and found still great reason to praise their
courage and fidelity. The time of their service being
elapsed, he dismissed them with many high commen∣dations.
Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Baskerville,
and Sir John Boroughs, acquired reputation this cam∣paign,
and revived in France the ancient fame of Eng∣lish
valour.</P>
<P>THE army which Henry next campaign led into
the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Henry the fourth.</NOTE> was much inferior to that of the League;
but as it was composed of the chief nobility of France,
he feared not to encounter his enemies in a pitched
battle at Yvrée, and he gained a compleat victory over
them. This success enabled him to blockade Paris,
and he reduced that capital to the last extremity of
famine: When the duke of Parma, in consequence
of orders from Philip, marched to the relief of the
League, and obliged Henry to raise the blockade.
Having performed this important service, he retired
back to the Low Countries: and by his consummate
skill in the art of war, performed these long marches
in the face of the enemy, without affording the French
monarch that opportunity which he sought, of giving
him battle, or so much as putting his army once in
disorder. The only loss which he sustained, was in
the Low Countries; where prince Maurice took ad∣vantage
of his absence, and recovered some towns
which Parma had formerly conquered from the States<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This year the nation susfereda great loss, by the death of Sir Francis Wal∣singham, secretary of state; a man equally celebrated for his ability and his integrity. He had passed thro' many employments, had been very frugal in his expences yet died so poor, that his family was obliged to give him a private burial. He left only one daughter, first married to Sir Philip Sidney, then to the earl of Essex, favourite to Queen Elizabeth, and lastly to the earl of Clan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icarde of Ireland. The same year died Thomas Randolph, who had been employed by the Queen in several embassies to Scotland; as did also the earl of Warwic, elder brother to Leicester.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE situation of Henry's affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1591.</NOTE> tho' promising,
was not so well advanced or established as to make
the Queen discontinue her succours; and she was still
<PB N="373" REF="420"/>
more confirmed in the resolution of supporting him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1591.</NOTE>
by some advantages gained by the King of Spain.
The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Britany, a prince
of the house of Lorraine, had declared for the League;
and finding himself hard pressed by Henry's forces, he
had been obliged, in order to his security, to introduce
some Spanish troops into the sea-port towns of that
province. Elizabeth was alarmed with the danger;
and foresaw, that the Spaniards, besides infesting the
English commerce by privateers, might employ these
harbours as the seat of their naval preparations, and
might more easily, from that near neighbourhood, than
from Spain or Portugal, project an invasion of Eng∣land.
She concluded, therefore, a new treaty with
Henry, in which she engaged to send over three thou∣sand
men, to be employed in the reduction of Britanny,
and stipulated, that her charges should, in a twelve
month, or so soon as the enemy was expelled, be re∣funded
her<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 561.</NOTE>. These forces were commanded by Sir
John Norris; and under him by his brother Henry,
and by Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at
the head of a small body which garrisoned Dieppe:
And a squadron of ships, under the command of Sir
Henry Palmer, lay upon the coast of France, and inter∣cepted
all the vessels belonging to the Spaniards or the
Leaguers.</P>
<P>THE events of war can very little be regulated before∣hand
by any treaty or agreement; and Henry, who
found it necessary to lay aside the projected enterprize
against Britanny, persuaded the English commanders
to join his army, and to take a share in the war which
he carried on in Picardy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 116.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding the disgust
which Elizabeth received from this disappointment,
he laid before her a plan for expelling the Leaguers
from Normandy, and persuaded her to send over a
new body of four thousand men, to assist him in that
<PB N="374" REF="421"/>
enterprize. The earl of Essex was appointed general
of these forces; a young nobleman, who, by many
exterior accomplishments, and still more real merit,
was daily advancing in favour with Elizabeth, and
seemed to occupy that place in her affections which
Leicester, who was now deceased, had so long enjoyed.
Essex, impatient for military fame, was extremely
uneasy to lie some time at Dieppe unemployed; and
had not the orders which he received from his mistress
heen so positive, he would gladly have accepted of
Henry's invitation, and have marched to join the
French army now in Champagne. This plan of ope∣rations
was also proposed to Elizabeth by the French
ambassador; but she rejected it with great displeasure;
and she threatned immediately to recall her troops, if
Henry should persevere any longer in his present prac∣tice,
of breaking all concert with her, and attending to
nothing but his own interests<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negociations. p. 5. Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 123, 140.</NOTE>. Urged by these mo∣tives,
the French King, at last, led his army into Nor∣mandy,
and laid siege to Roüen, which he reduced to
great difficulties. But the League, who were unable
of themselves to take the field against him, had again
recourse to the duke of Parma, who received orders to
march to their assistance. He executed this enter∣prize
with his usual ability and success; and, for the
present, frustrated all the projects of Henry and Eliza∣beth.
This princess, who kept still in view the in∣terests
of her own kingdoms in all her foreign transac∣tions,
was impatient under these disappointments, blam∣ed
Henry for his negligence in the execution of treaties,
and complained, that the English forces were thrust for∣ward
in every hazardous enterprize<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 562.</NOTE>. It is probable,
however, that their own ardent courage, and their
desire of distinguishing themselves in so celebrated a
<PB N="375" REF="422"/>
theatre for war, were the cause why they so often en∣joyed
this perilous honour.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the indifferent success of for∣mer
enterprizes, the Queen was sensible how neces∣sary
it was to support Henry against the League and
the Spaniards; and she formed a new treaty with him,
in which they agreed, never to make peace with Philip,
but by common consent; <HI>she</HI> promised to send him
a new supply of four thousand men; and <HI>he</HI> stipulated
to repay her charges in a twelvemonth, to employ
these forces, joined to a body of French troops, in an
expedition against Britanny, and to consign into her
hands a sea-port town of that province, for a retreat
to the English<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 151, 168, 171, 173.</NOTE>. Henry knew the impossibility of exe∣cuting
some of these articles, and the imprudence of
fulfilling others; but finding them rigidly insisted on
by Elizabeth, he accepted of her succours, and trusted
that he might easily, on some pretence, be able to ex∣cuse
his failure in the execution of his part of the treaty.
This campaign was the least successful to Henry of all
those which he had yet carried on against the League.</P>
<P>DURING these military operations in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enter∣prizes against Spain.</NOTE> Eli∣zabeth
employed her naval power against Spain, and
endeavoured to intercept the West-Indian treasures,
the source of that greatness which rendered Philip so
formidable to all his neighbours. She sent a squadron
of seven ships, under the command of lord Thomas
Howard, for this service; but the King of Spain,
informed of her purpose, fitted out a navy of fifty-five
sail, and dispatched them to escort the Indian fleet.
They fell in with the English squadron; and by the
courageous obstinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the
vice-admiral, who refused to make his escape by flight,
they took one ship, the first English man of war which
<PB N="376" REF="423"/>
had yet fallen into the hands of the Spaniards<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This action of Sir Richard Greenville is so singular, as to merit a more particular relation. He was engaged alone with the whole Spanish fleet of fifty-three sail, which had ten thousand men on board; and from the time the fight begun, which was about three in the afternoon, to the break of day next morning, he repulsed the enemy fifteen times, tho' they continual∣ly shifted their vessels, and boarded with fresh men. In the beginning of the action he himself received a wound; but he continued doing his duty above deck till eleven at night, when receiving a fresh wound, he was car∣ried down to be dressed. During this operation he received a shot in the head, and the surgeon was killed by his side. The English began now to want powder; all their small arms were broke or become useless; of this number, which were but a hundred and three at first, forty were killed, and almost all the rest wounded; their masts were beat overboard, their tackle cut in pieces, and nothing but a hulk left, unable to move one way or other. In this situation Sir Richard proposed to the ship's company, to trust to the mercy of God, not to that of the Spaniards, and to destroy the ship with themselves, rather than yield to the enemy. The master gunner, and many of the seamen, agreed to this desperate resolution; but others opposed it, and obliged Greenville to surrender himself prisoner. He died a few days after and his last words were: “Here die I, Richard Green∣ville, with a i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yful and quiet mind; for that I have ended my life as a true soldier ought to do, fighting for his country, Queen, religion, and honour: My soul willingly departing from this body, leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in his duty bound to do.” The Spaniards lost in this sharp tho' unequal action, four ships, and about a thousand men. And Greenville's vessel herself perished soon after, with two hundred Spaniards in her. Hackluyt's Voyages, vol. II. part 2. p. 169. Camden, p. 565.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1592.</NOTE> The
rest of the squadron returned safely into England, frus∣trated
of their expectations, but pleasing themselves
with the idea that their attempt had not been altogether
fruitless in hurting the enemy. The Indian fleet
had been so long detained in the Havanna, from the fear
of the English, that they were obliged at last to set sail
in an improper season, and most of them perished by
shipwreck ere they reached the Spanish harbours<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 163.</NOTE>.
The earl of Cumberland made a like unsuccessful enter∣prize
against the Spanish trade. He carried out one
ship of the Queen's, and seven others, equipped at his
own expence; but the prizes which he made, did not
compensate him for the charges<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE spirit of these expensive and hazardous adven∣tures
was very prevalent in England. Sir Walter
<PB N="377" REF="424"/>
Raleigh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> who had enjoyed great favour with the Queen,
finding his interest to decline, resolved to recover her
good graces by some important undertaking; and as his
reputation was high in England, he persuaded great
numbers to engage with him as volunteers, in an at∣tempt
on the West-Indies. The fleet was detained,
so long in the Channel, by contrary winds, that the
season was lost; Raleigh was recalled by the Queen:
Sir Martin Forbisher succeeded to the command, and
made a privateering voyage against the Spaniards. He
took a rich Carrack near the island of Flores, and des∣troyed
another<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 165. Camden, p. 569.</NOTE>. About the same time, Thomas
White, a Londoner, took two Spanish ships, which,
besides fourteen hundred chests of quicksilver, contained
above two millions of bulls for indulgences; a com∣modity
useless to the English, but which had cost the
King of Spain three hundred thousand florins, and
would have been sold by him in the Indies for five
millions.</P>
<P>THIS war did great damage to Spain; but it was
attended with considerable expence to England, and
Elizabeth's ministers computed, that, since the com∣mencement
of it, she had expended in Flanders and
France, and on her naval expeditions, above one mil∣lion
two hundred thousand pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III.</NOTE>; a charge which,
notwithstanding her extreme frugality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 February.</NOTE> was too bur∣thensome
for her narrow revenues to bear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> She sum∣moned,
therefore, a Parliament, in order to obtain
supply: But she either thought her authority so esta∣blished,
that she needed to make them no concessions
in return, or she rated her power and prerogative above
money: For there was never any Parliament whom
she treated in so haughty a manner, whom she made
more sensible of their own weakness, or whose privile∣ges
she more undervalued. When the speaker, Sir
Edward Coke, made the three usual demands, of free∣dom
<PB N="378" REF="425"/>
from arrests, of access to her person, and of liber∣ty
of speech; she replied to him, by the mouth of
Puckering, lord-keeper, that liberty of speech was
granted the commons, but they must know what liber∣ty
they were entitled to; not a liberty for every one
to speak what he listeth, or what cometh in his brain
to utter; their privilege extended no farther than a
liberty of Aye or No: That she enjoined the speaker,
if he perceived any idle heads so negligent of their own
safety, as to attempt reforming the church, or inno∣vating
in the commonwealth, that he should refuse the
bills exhibited to that purpose, till they were examined
by such as were fitter to consider of these things, and
could better judge of them: That she would not
impeach the freedom of their persons; but they must
beware, left, under colour of this privilege, they imagi∣ned,
that any neglect of their duty could be covered or
protected: And that she would not refuse them access
to her person; provided it was upon urgent and weigh∣ty
causes, and at times convenient, and when she
might have leisure from other important causes of the
realm<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 460, 469. Townsend, p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the menacing and contemp∣tuous
air of this speech, the intrepid and indefatigable
Peter Wentworth, not discouraged by his former ill
success, ventured to transgress the imperial orders of
Elizabeth. He presented to the lord keeper a petition,
in which he desired the upper house to join with the
lower in a supplication to her majesty, for entailing
the succession of the crown; and declared, that he had
a bill ready prepared for that purpose. This method
of proceeding was sufficiently respectful and cautious;
but the subject was always extremely disagreeable to
the Queen, and what she had expressly prohibited any
one to meddle with: She sent Wentworth immediately
to the Tower; committed Sir Thomas Bromley, who
<PB N="379" REF="426"/>
had seconded him, to the Fleet prison, together with
Stevens, and Welsh, two members, to whom Sir
Thomas had communicated his intention<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 470. Townsend, p. 54.</NOTE>. About a
fortnight after, a motion was made in the house, to peti∣tion
the Queen, for the release of these members; but
it was answered by all the privy counsellors there pre∣sent,
that her majesty had committed them for causes
best known to herself, and that to press her on that
head would only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen
whom they meant to serve: She would release them
whenever she thought proper, and would be better
pleased to do it of her own proper motion, than from
their suggestion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 497.</NOTE>. The house willingly acquiesced in
this reasoning.</P>
<P>So arbitrary an act, at the commencement of the sessi∣on,
might well repress all farther attempts for freedom:
But the religious zeal for the puritans was not so easily
restrained; and it inspired a courage which no human
motive was able to surmount. Morrice, attorney of
the court of wards, made a motion for redressing the
abuses in the bishop's courts, but above all, in the high
commission; where subscriptions, he said, were exacted
to articles at the pleasure of the prelates; where oaths
were imposed, obliging persons to answer to all ques∣tions
without distinction, even tho' they should tend to
their own condemnation; and where every one who
refused entire satisfaction to the commissioners, was im∣prisoned,
without relief or remedy<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 474. Townsend, p. 60.</NOTE>. This motion
was seconded by some members; but the ministers and
privy counsellors opposed it; and foretold the conse∣quences
which ensued. The Queen sent for the speak∣er;
and after requiring him to deliver Morrice's bill
to her, she told him, that it was in her power to call
Parliaments, in her power to dissolve them, in her pow∣er
to give assent or dissent to any determination which
<PB N="380" REF="427"/>
they should form:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> That her purpose in summoning
this Parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted for
the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion, and
to provide for the defence of the nation, against the ex∣orbitant
power of Spain: That these two points
ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberation:
She had enjoined them already, by the mouth of the
lord keeper, to meddle neither with matters of state nor
of religion; and she wondered how any one could be so
assuming, as to attempt a subject so expressly contrary
to her prohibition: That she was highly offended with
this presumption; and took the present opportunity to
reiterate the commands given by the keeper, and to
require, that no bill, regarding either state affairs, or re∣formation
in causes ecclesiastical, be exhibited in the
house: And that in particular she charged the speaker
upon his allegiance, that if any such bills were offered,
absolutely to resuse them a reading, and not so much
as permit them to be debated by the members<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 474, 478. Townsend, p. 68.</NOTE>. This
command from the Queen was submitted to, without
farther question. Morrice was seized in the house by
a serjeant at arms, discharged from his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of chan∣cellor
of the dutchy, disabled from any prac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his
profession as a common lawyer, and kept for some
years prisoner in Tilbury castle<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Heylin's His∣tory of the Presbyterian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 320.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen having thus expressly pointed out,
both what the house should and should not do, the com∣mons
were as obsequious to the one as to the other
of her injunctions. They passed a very severe law
against recusants; such a law as was suited to the se∣vere
character of Elizabeth and to the persecuting spi∣rit
of that age. It was intitled, An act to retain her
majesty's subjects in their due obedience; and was meant,
as the preamble declares, to obviate such inconvenien∣cies
and perils as might grow from the wicked practices
<PB N="381" REF="428"/>
of seditious sectaries and disloyal persons: For these
two species of criminals were always, at that time,
confounded together, as equally dangerous to the peace
of society. It was enacted, that any person, above six∣teen
years of age, who obstinately refused, during the
space of a month, to attend the public worship, should
be committed to prison; that, if after being condemn∣ed
for this offence, he persist three months in his refu∣sal,
he must abjure the realm; and that if he either re∣suse
this condition, or return after banishment, he is to
suffer capitally as a felon, without benefit of clergy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>.
This law bore equally hard upon the puritans as upon
the catholics; and had it not been imposed by the
Queen's authority, was probably, in that respect, very
much contrary to the private sentiments and inclinati∣ons
of the majority in the house of commons. Very
little opposition, however, appears there to have been
openly made to it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">After enacting this statute, the clergy, in order to remove the odium from themselves, often took care that recusants should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e tried by the civil judges at the assizes, rather than by the ecclesiastical commissioners. Strype's Ann. Vol. IV. p. 264.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE expences of the war with Spain having re∣duced
the Queen to great necessity of a supply, the grant
of subsidies seems to have been the most important bu∣siness
of this Parliament; and it was a singular mark
of the high spirit of Elizabeth, that, while conscious
of a present dependance on the commons, she opened
the session with the most haughty treatment of them,
and covered her weakness under such a losty appear∣ance
of superiority. The commons readily voted two
subsidies and four fifteenths; but this sum not appear∣ing
sufficient to the court, a very unusual expedient was
fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement in
their concession. The peers informed the commons in
a conference, that they could not give their assent to the
supply voted, thinking it too small for the Queen's oc∣occasions:
<PB N="382" REF="429"/>
They therefore proposed a grant of three
subsidies and six fifteenths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> and desired a conference, in
order to persuade the commons to agree to this mea∣sure.
The commons, who had acquired the privilege
of beginning all bills of subsidy, took offence at this
procedure of the lords, and at first absolutely rejected
the conference: But being afraid, on reflection, that
they had, by this refusal, given offence to their supe∣riors,
they both agreed to the conference, and after∣wards
voted the additional subsidy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 483, 487, 488. Townsend, p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, notwithstanding this unusual concession
of the commons, ended the session with a speech, con∣taining
some reprimands to them, and full of the same
high pretensions, which she had assumed at the open∣ing
of the Parliament. She took notice, by the mouth
of the keeper, that some members spent more time than
was necessary, by indulging themselves in harangues
and reasonings: And she expressed her displeasure on
account of their not paying their due reverence to pri∣vy
counsellors, “who,” she told them, “were not
to be accounted as common knights and burgesses
of the house, who are counsellors but during the
Parliament: Whereas, the others are standing
counsellors, and for their wisdom and great service
are called to the council of the state<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 466. Townsend, p. 47.</NOTE>.” The Queen
also, in her own person, made the Parliament a spirited
harangue; in which she spoke of the justice and mo∣deration
of her government, expressed the small ambi∣tion
she had ever entertained of making conquests, dif∣played
the just grounds of her quarrel with the King
of Spain, and discovered how little she apprehended the
power of that monarch, even tho' he should make a
greater effort than that of his Invincible Armada.
“But I am informed,” added she, “that when he
attempted this last invasion, some upon the sea-coasts
<PB N="383" REF="430"/>
forsook their towns, fled up higher into the country,
and left all naked and exposed to his entrance: But
I swear unto you, by God, if I knew those persons,
or may know of any that shall do so hereafter, I will
make them feel what it is to be so fearful in so ur∣gent
a cause<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 466. Townsend, p. 48.</NOTE>.” By this menace, she probably
gave the people to understand that she would exercise
martial law upon such cowards: For there was no sta∣tute
by which a man could be punished for changing
his place of abode.</P>
<P>THE King of France, tho' he had hitherto made
war on the League with great bravery and reputation,
tho' he had this campaign gained considerable advanta∣ges
over them, and tho' he was assisted by a considera∣rable
body of English under Norris, who carried hos∣tilities
into the heart of Britanny; was become sensi∣ble,
that he never could, by force of arms alone, render
himself master of his kingdom. The nearer his mili∣tary
successes seemed to approach him to a full possession
of the throne, the more discontent and jealousy arose
among those Romanists who adhered to him; and a par∣ty
was formed in his own court to elect some catholic
monarch of the royal blood, if Henry refused any longer
to satisfy them by declaring his conversion. This ex∣cellent
prince was far from being a bigot to his fect;
and as he deemed these theological disputes to be en∣tirely
subordinate to the public good, he had tacitly de∣termined,
from the beginning, to come, some time or
other, to the resolution required of him. He had found,
on the death of his predecessor, that the hugonots, who
formed the bravest and most faithful part of his army,
were such determined zealots, that, if he had, at that
time, abjured their faith, they would instantly have
abandoned him to the pretensions and usurpations of
the catholics. The more bigoted catholics, he knew,
particularly those of the League, had entertained such
<PB N="384" REF="431"/>
an unsurmountable prejudice against his person, and
diffidence of his sincerity, that even his conversion
would not reconcile them to his title; and he must ei∣ther
expect to be entirely excluded from the throne, or
to be admitted to it on such terms as would leave him
little more than the mere shadow of royalty. In this
delicate situation he had resolved to temporize; to re∣tain
the hugonots by continuing the profession of their
religion; to gain the moderate catholics by giving them
hopes of his conversion; to attach both to his person
by conduct and success; and he hoped, either that the
animosity of war against the League would make them
drop gradually the question of religion, or that he
might, in time, after some victories over his enemies
and some conferences with divines, make finally, with
more decency and dignity, that abjuration, which must
have appeared, at first, both mean and suspicious to both
parties.</P>
<P>WHEN the people are attached to any theological te∣nets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry
IV. embraces the catholic religion.</NOTE> merely from a general persuasion or prepossession,
they are easily induced, by any motive or authority, to
change their faith in these mysterious subjects; as ap∣pears
from the example of the English, who, during
some reigns, generally embraced, without scruple, the
still varying religion of their sovereigns. But a nation,
like the French, where principles had so long been dis∣played
as the badges of faction, and where each party
had fortified its belief by an animosity against the other,
were not found so pliable or inconstant; and Henry
was at last convinced, that the catholics of his party
would entirely abandon him, if he gave them not im∣mediate
satisfaction in this particular. The hugonots
also, taught by experience, clearly saw, that his defer∣tion
of them was become entirely necessary for the pub∣lic
settlement; and so general was this persuasion among
them, that, the duke of Sully pretends, even the di∣vines
of that party purposely allowed themselves to be
<PB N="385" REF="432"/>
overcome in the disputes and conferences; that the
King might more readily be convinced of the weakness
of their cause, and might more cordially and sincerely,
at least more decently, embrace the religion which it
was so much his interest to believe. If this self-denial,
in so tender a point, should appear incredible and super∣natural
in theologians, it will, at least, be thought very
natural, that a prince, so little instructed in these points
as Henry, and so desirous to preserve his sincerity,
should insensibly bend his opinion to the necessity of
his affairs, and should believe that party to have the
best arguments, who could alone put him in possession
of a kingdom. All circumstances, therefore, being pre∣pared
for this great event, that monarch renounced the
protestant religion, and was solemnly received, by the
French prelates of his party, into the bosom of the
church.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was, herself, chiefly attached to
the protestants, by her interests and the circumstances
of her birth, and who seems to have entertained some
propensity, during her whole life, to the catholic su∣perstition,
at least, to the antient ceremonies, yet pre∣tended
to be extremely displeased with this abjuration
of Henry; and she wrote him a very angry letter, re∣proaching
him with this interested change of his reli∣gion.
Sensible, however, that the League and the
King of Spain were still their common enemies, she
hearkened to his apologies; continued her succours both
of men and money; and formed a new treaty, in which
they mutually stipulated never to make peace but by
common agreement.</P>
<P>THE intrigues of Spain were not limited to France
and England:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> The never failing pretence of religion,
joined to the influence of money, excited new disorders
in Scotland, and gave fresh alarms to Elizabeth.
George Ker, brother to the lord Newbottle, had been
taken, while he was making his passage secretly into
<PB N="386" REF="433"/>
Spain; and some papers were found about him, by
which a dangerous conspiracy of some catholic noble∣men
with Philip was discovered. The earls of Angus,
Errol, and Huntley, the heads of three potent families,
had entered into a consederacy with the Spanish mo∣narch;
and had stipulated to raise all their forces, to
join them to thirty thousand Spanish troops, which Phi∣lip
engaged to send into Scotland; and after re-estab∣lishing
the catholic religion in that kingdom, to march
with their united power, in order to effectuate the same
purpose in England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 391. Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 190.</NOTE>. Graham of Fintry, who had
also entered into this conspiracy, was taken and ar∣raigned,
and executed. Elizabeth sent lord Borough
ambassador into Scotland, and exhorted the King to
exercise the same severity on the three earls, to for∣feit
their estates, and by annexing them to the crown,
both increase his own demesnes, and set an example to
all his subjects of the dangers attending treason and re∣bellion.
This advice was certainly very rational, but
not easy to be executed by the small revenue and limit∣ed
authority of James. He desired, therefore, some
supply from her of men and money; but tho' she had
reason to deem the prosecution of the three popish earls
a common cause, he never could obtain the least assis∣tance
from her. The tenth part of the expence, which
she bestowed in supporting the French King and the
States, would have sussiced to execute this purpose,
more immediately essential to her security<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 393. Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 235.</NOTE>: But she
seems ever to have borne some degree of malignity to
James, whom she hated, both as her heir, and as the
son of Mary, her hated rival and competitor. So far
from giving him assistance to prosecute the catholic con∣spirators,
she rather contributed to his inquietude, by
countenancing the turbulent disposition of the earl
<PB N="387" REF="434"/>
of Bothwel<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 257, 258.</NOTE>, a nobleman descended from a natural son
of James the fifth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1594.</NOTE> Bothwel more than once attempt∣ed
to render himself master of the King's person; and
being expelled the kingdom for these traiterous designs,
he took shelter in England, was secretly protected by
the Queen, and lurked near the borders, where his pow∣er
lay, with a view of still enterprizing some new vio∣lence.
He succeeded at last in an attempt on the King;
and by the mediation of the English ambassador, im∣posed
very dishonourable terms upon that prince: But
James, with the authority of the convention of states,
annulled this agreement as imposed by violence; again
expelled Bothwel the country; and obliged him to take
shelter in England. Elizabeth, pretending ignorance
of the place of his retreat, never executed the treaties,
by which she was bound to deliver up all rebels and fu∣gitives
to the King of Scotland. During these disor∣ders,
encreased by the refractory disposition of the ec∣clesiastics,
the prosecution of the catholic earls remain∣ed
in suspence; but at last the Parliament passed an act
of attainder against them, and the King prepared him∣self
to execute it by force of arms. The noblemen,
tho' they obtained a victory over the earl of Argyle,
who acted by the King's commission, found themselves
hard pressed by James himself, and agreed, on certain
terms, to leave the kingdom. Bothwel, being detect∣ed
in a consederacy with them, forfeited the favour of
Elizabeth, and was obliged to take shelter, first in
France, then in Italy, where he died, some years after,
in great poverty.</P>
<P>THE established authority of the Queen secured her
from all such attempts as James was exposed to from
the mutinous disposition of his subjects; and her ene∣mies
found no other means of giving her any domestic
disturbance than by such traiterous and persidious
machinations, as ended in their own disgrace, and in
<PB N="388" REF="435"/>
the ruin of their criminal instruments. Roderigo
Lopez, a Jew, domestic physician to the Queen, being
imprisoned on suspicion, confessed, that he had recei∣ed
a bribe to poison her from Fuentes and Ibarra, who
had succeeded Parma, lately deceased, in the govern∣ment
of the Netherlands; but he maintained, that he
had no other intention than to cheat Philip of his money,
and never meant to fulfil his promise. He was,
however, executed for the conspiracy; and the Queen
complained to Philip of these dishonourable attempts of
his ministers, but could obtain no satisfaction<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 577. Birch's Negot. p. 15. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 381.</NOTE>. York
and Williams, two English traitors, were afterwards
executed for a like conspiracy with Ibarra<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 582.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of revenging herself, by retaliating in this
shameful manner, Elizabeth fought a more honourable
vengeance, by supporting the King of France, and
assisting him in finally breaking the force of the League,
which, after the conversion of that monarch, went
daily to decay, and was threatned with speedy ruin and
dissolution. Norris commanded the English forces in
Britanny, and assisted at the taking of Morlaix, Quim∣percorentin,
and Brest, towns guarded by Spanish for∣ces
in that province. In every action, the English,
tho' they had so long enjoyed domistic peace, discover∣ed
a strong military disposition; and the Queen, tho'
herself a heroine, found more frequent occasion to re∣prove
her generals for encouraging their temerity, than
for countenancing their fear or caution<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 578.</NOTE>. Sir Martin
Forbisher, her brave admiral, perished, with many
others, before Brest. Morlaix had been promised the
English for a place of retreat; but the duke d'Aumont,
the French general, eluded this promise by making it
to be inserted in the capitulation, that none but catholics
should be admitted into that city.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="436"/>
NEXT campaign, the French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1595.</NOTE>
long carried on hostilities with Philip, was at last
provoked, by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens,
and the attack of Cambray, to declare war against
that monarch. Elizabeth, being threatned with a new
invasion in England, and with an insurrection in Ire∣land,
recalled most of her forces, and sent Norris to
command in this latter kingdom. Finding also, that
the French League was almost entirely dissolved, and
that the most considerable leaders had made an accommo∣dation
with their prince, she thought that he could well
support himself by his own force and valour, and she
began to be more sparing in his cause, of the blood and
treasure of her subjects.</P>
<P>SOME disgusts, which she had received from the
states, joined to the remonstrances of her frugal minis∣ter,
Burleigh, made her also inclined to diminish her
charges on that side; and she even demanded, by her
ambassador, Sir Thomas Bodley, to be reimbursed all
the money, which she had expended in supporting
them. The states, besides alledging the conditions
of the former treaty, by which they were not bound to
repay her, till the conclusion of a peace, pleaded
their present poverty and distress, the great superiori∣ty
of the Spaniards, and the difficulty of supporting the
war; much more, of saving money to discharge their
incumbrances. After much negotiation, a new treaty
was at last fromed; by which the states engaged to
free the Queen immediately from the charge of the
English auxiliaries, computed at forty thousand pounds
a year, to pay her annually twenty thousand pounds
a years, to pay her annually twenty thousand pounds for
some years, to assist her with a certain number of ships.
and to conclude no peace nor treaty without her con∣sent.
They also bound themselves, on the conclusion
of the peace with Spain, to pay her annually the sum
of an hundred thousand pounds for four years; but on
this condition, that the payment should be in lieu of all
debts, and that they should be supplied, tho' at their
<PB N="390" REF="437"/>
own charges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1596.</NOTE> with a body of four thousand auxiliaries
from England<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 586.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen still retained in her hands the cautiona∣ry
towns, which were a great check on the rising
power of the states; and she committed the important
charge of Flushing to Sir Francis Vere, a brave officer,
who had been much distinguished by his valour in the
Low Countries. She gave this gentleman the prefer∣ence
to Essex, who expected so honourable a command;
and tho' that earl was daily rising both in reputation
with the people, and favour with herself, the Queen,
who was commonly reserved in the advancement of
her courtiers, thought proper, on this occasion, to give
him a refusal. Sir Thomas Baskerville was sent over
to France at the head of two thousand English, with
which Elizabeth, by a new treaty, concluded with
Henry, engaged to supply that prince. Some stipula∣tions
for mutual assistance were formed by the treaty;
and all the former engagements were renewed.</P>
<P>THIS body of English troops were maintained at the
expence of the French King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> yet did Henry esteem
this supply of considerable advantage, on account of
the great reputation acquired by the English, in so
many fortunate enterprizes, undertaken against the
common enemy. In the great battle of Turnhoult,
gained this campaign by prince Maurice, the English
auxiliaries under Sir Francis Vere and Sir Robert Sid∣ney
had extremely distinguished themselves; and the
fortunate success of that day was universally ascribed to
their discipline and valour.</P>
<P>THO'<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enterprizes.</NOTE> Elizabeth, at a great expence of blood and
treasure, made war against Philip in France and the
Low Countries, the most severe blows which she gave
the Spanish greatness, were owing to those naval enter∣prizes,
which either she or her subjects scarce ever in∣termitted
during one season. In 1594, Richard Haw∣kins,
<PB N="391" REF="438"/>
son to Sir John, the famous navigator, pro∣cured
the Queen's commission, and sailed with three
ships to the South Sea by the straits of Magellan: But
his voyage proved unfortunate, and he himself was
taken prisoner on the coast of Chili. James Lancaster
was supplyed the same year with three ships and a pin∣nace
by the merchants of London; and was more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtunate in his adventures. He took thirty-nine ships
of the enemy; and not contented with this success, he
made an attempt on Fernambouc in Brazil, where,
he knew, great treasures were at that time lodged. As
he approached the land, he saw it lined with great num∣bers
of the enemy; but no-wife daunted with this
appearance, he placed the stoutest of his men in boats,
and ordered them to row with such violence against the
shore as to split them in pieces. By this bold action,
he both deprived his men of all hopes of saving them∣selves
but by victory, and terrified the enemy, who
fled after a short resistance. He returned home safely
with the treasure, which he had so bravely acquired.
In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew forfeited
the Queen's friendship by an intrigue with one of the
maids of honour, and who had been confined in pri∣son
for this misdemeanor, no sooner recovered his liber∣ty
than he was pushed by his active and enterprizing
genius to attempt some great action. The success of
the first Spanish adventures against Mexico and Peru
had begot an extreme avidity in Europe; and a pre∣possession
universally took place, that in the inland parts
of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet
undiscovered, there were mines and treasures and riches
far exceeding any thing which Cortes or Pizarro had
met with. Raleigh, whose turn of mind was some∣what
romantic and extravagant, undertook at his own
charge the discovery of this wonderful country. Hav∣ing
taken the small town of St. Joseph in the isle of
Trin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ado, where he found no riches, he left his ship,
<PB N="392" REF="439"/>
and sailed up the river Oroonoko in pinnaces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> but with∣out
meeting with any thing to answer his expectations.
On his return, he published an account of this country,
full of the greatest and most palpable lies, that were ever
attempted to be imposed on the credulity of mankind<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 584.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John
Hawkins undertook a more important expedition
against the Spanish settlements in America; and they
carried with them six ships of the Queen's and twenty
more, which they had either fitted out at their own
charges, or which were furnished them by private ad∣venturers.
Sir Thomas Baskerville was appointed com∣mander
of the land forces, which they carried on board,
Their first design was to attempt Porto Rico, where,
they knew, a rich carrack was at that time stationed;
but as they had not preserved the requisite secrecy, a
pinnace, having strayed from the fleet, was taken by
the Spaniards, and betrayed the intentions of the English,
Preparations were made in that island to receive them; and
the English fleet, notwithstanding the brave assault, which
they made on the enemy, was repulsed with loss. Haw∣kins
soon after died; and Drake pursued his course to
to Nombre di Dios, on the isthmus of Darien; where,
having landed his men, he attempted to pass forward
to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or,
if he found such a scheme practicable, of keeping and
fortifying it. But he met not with the same facility,
which had attended his first enterprizes in these parts.
The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where
fortified the passes, and had stationed troops in the
woods; who so infested the English by continual
alarms and skirmishes, that they were obliged to re∣turn,
without being able to effectuate any thing.
Drake himself, from the intemperance of the climate,
from the fatigues of his journey, and from the vexation
of his disappointment, was seized with a distemper, of
<PB N="393" REF="440"/>
which he soon after died. Sir Thomas Baskerville
took the command of the fleet, which was in a very
weak condition; and after having fought a battle near
Cuba with a Spanish fleet, of which the event was not
decisive, he returned to England. The Spaniards suf∣fered
some loss from this enterprize; but the English
reaped no profit<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bad success of this enterprize in the Indies
made the English rather attempt the Spanish dominions
in Europe, where, they heard, Philip was making great
preparations for a new invasion of England. A power∣ful
fleet was equipped at Plymouth consisting of an
hundred and seventy vessels, seventeen of which were
capital ships of war; the rest tenders and small vessels:
Twenty ships were added by the Hollanders. In this
fleet there were computed to be six thousand three
hundred and sixty soldiers, a thousand volunteers, and
six thousand seven hundred and seventy-two seamen,
beside the Dutch. The land forces were commanded
by the earl of Essex. The navy by lord Effingham,
high admiral. Both these commanders had expended
great sums of their own in this armament: For such was
the spirit of Elizabeth's reign. The lord Thomas
Howard, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir
George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had com∣mands
in this expedition, and were named as a council
to the general and admiral<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 591.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fleet set sail on the first of June 1596; and
meeting with a fair wind, bent their course to Cadiz,
at which place, by sealed orders delivered to all the
captains, the general rendesvous was appointed. They
sent before them some armed tenders, which intercept∣ed
every ship, that could carry intelligence to the
enemy; and they themselves were so fortunate when
they came near Cadiz, as to take an Irish vessel, by
which they learned, that that port was full of mer∣chant
<PB N="394" REF="441"/>
ships of great value, and that the Spaniards
lived in perfect security, without any apprehensions of
an enemy. This intelligence much encouraged the
English fleet, and gave them the prospect of a fortunate
issue to the enterprize.</P>
<P>AFTER a fruitless attempt to land at St. Sebastians
on the western side of the island of Cadiz; it was,
upon deliberation, resolved by the council of war to at∣tack
the ships and gallies in the bay. This attempt was
deemed very rash; and the lord admiral himself, who
was cautious in his temper, had entertained great
scruples with regard to it: But Essex strenuously urged
the enterprize; and when he found the resolution at
last taken, he threw his hat into the sea, and gave symp∣toms
of the most extravagant joy. He felt, however,
a great mortification, when Effingham informed him,
that the Queen, who was anxious for his safety, and
who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour, had
secretly given orders, that he should not be permitted
to command the van in the attack<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 196.</NOTE>. That duty was
performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and the lord Tho∣mas
Howard; but Essex no sooner came within reach
of the enemy, than he forgot the promise which the
admiral had exacted of him to keep in the midst of the
fleet; He broke thro' and pressed forward into the
thickest of the fire. Emulation for glory, avidity of
plunder, animosity against the Spaniards proved incen∣tives
to every one; and the enemy were soon obliged
to slip anchor, and retreat farther into the bay, where
they ran many of their ships aground. Essex then land∣ed
his men at the fort of Puntal; and immediately
marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous
valour of the English soon carried sword in hand. The
generosity of Essex, which was not inferior to his
valour, made him stop the slaughter, and treat his
prisoners with the greatest humanity, and even affabili∣ty
<PB N="395" REF="442"/>
and kindness. The English made rich plunder in
the city;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> but missed of a much richer by the resoluti∣on,
which the duke of Medina, the Spanish admiral,
took, of setting fire to the ships, in order to prevent
their falling into the hands of the enemy. It was com∣puted,
that the loss, which the Spaniards sustained in
this enterprize, amounted to twenty millions of du∣cats<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 97.</NOTE>; besides the indignity, which that proud and
ambitious people received, from the taking one of their
chief cities, and destroying in their harbour a fleet of
such force and value.</P>
<P>ESSEX, all on fire for glory, regarded this great suc∣cess
only as a step to future atchievements: He insisted
on the keeping possession of Cadiz, and he undertook
with four hundred men and three months provisions,
to defend the place till succours should arrive from En∣gland.
But all the other seamen and soldiers were sa∣tisfied
with the honour which they had acquired; and
were impatient to return home, in order to secure their
plunder. Every other proposal of Essex to annoy the
enemy, met with a like reception; his scheme for in∣tercepting
the carracks at the Azores, for assaulting
the Groyne, for taking St. Andero, and St. Sebastian:
And the English, finding so great difficulty to drag this
impatient warrior from the enemy, at last left him on
the Spanish coast, attended with very few ships. He
complained much to the Queen, of their want of spirit
in this enterprize; nor was she pleased, that they had
returned without attempting to intercept the Indian
fleet<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 121.</NOTE>; but the great success in the enterprize on Ca∣diz,
had covered all their miscarriages: And that prin∣cess,
tho' she admired the lofty genius of Essex, could
not forbear expressing an esteem for the other officers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 593.</NOTE>.
The admiral was created earl of Nottingham; and his
promotion gave great disgust to Essex<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sydney Papers, vol. II. 77.</NOTE>. In the pre∣amble
<PB N="396" REF="443"/>
of the patent it was said, that the new dignity
was conferred on him, on account of his good services
in taking Cadiz, and destroying the Spanish ships; a
merit which Essex pretended to belong solely to him∣self:
And he offered to maintain this plea by single
combat against the earl of Nottingham, or his sons, or
any of his kindred.</P>
<P>THE atchievements in the subsequent year proved
not so fortunate; but, as the Indian fleet very narrow∣ly
escaped the English, Philip had still reason to see the
great hazard and disadvantage of that war in which he
was engaged, and the superiority which the English,
by thier naval power, and their situation, had acquired
over him. The Queen, having received intelligence,
that the Spaniards, tho' their fleets were so much shat∣tered
and destroyed, by the expedition at Cadiz, were
preparing a squadron at Ferrol and the Groyne, and
were marching troops thither, with a view of making
an invasion on Ireland, was resolved to prevent their en∣terprize,
and to destroy the shipping in these harbours.
She prepared a large fleet of a hundred and twenty
sail, of which seventeen were her own ships, forty∣three
were smaller vessels, and the rest tenders and vic∣tuallers:
She embarked on board this fleet five thou∣sand
new-levied soldiers, and added a thousand veteran
troops, whom Sir Francis Vere brought from the Ne∣therlands.
The earl of Essex, commander in chief,
both of the land and sea forces, was at the head of one
squadron: Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice∣admiral
of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of the third:
Lord Mountjoy commanded the land forces under Es∣sex:
Vere was appointed marshal: Sir George Carew
lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir Christopher Blount
first colonel. The earls of Rutland and Southampton,
the lords Grey, Cromwel, and Rich, with several other
persons of distinction, attended as volunteers. Essex
declared his resolution, either to destroy the new Ar∣mada,
<PB N="397" REF="444"/>
which threatned England, or to perish in the
attempt.</P>
<P>THIS powerful fleet set ail from Plymouth; but
were no sooner out of the harbour than they met with
a furious storm, which shattered and dispersed them;
and before they could be refitted, Essex found, that
their provisions were so far spent, that it would not be
safe to carry so numerous an army along with him. He
dismissed, therefore, all the soldiers, except the thou∣sand
veterans under vere; and laying aside all thoughts
of attacking Ferrol or the Groyne, he confined the
object of his expedition to the intercepting the Indian
fleet; which had at first been considered only as the
second enterprize which he was to attempt.</P>
<P>THE Indian fleet, in that age, by reason of the im∣perfection
of navigation, had a stated course, as well as
season, both in their going out and in their return; and
there were certain islands, at which, as at fixed stages,
they always touched, and where they took in water
and provisions. The Azores, being one of these pla∣ces
where, about this time, the fleet was expected, Es∣sex
bent his course thither; and he informed Raleigh,
that he, on his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one
of these islands. By some accident the squadrons were
separated; and Raleigh arriving first before Fayal,
thought it more prudent, after waiting some time for
the general, to begin the attack alone, lest the inhabi∣tants
should, by farther delay, have leizure to make
greater preparations for their defence. He succeeded
in the enterprize; but Essex, jealous of Raleigh, ex∣pressed
great displeasure at this conduct, and constru∣ed
it as an intention of robbing the general of the glo∣ry
which attended that action: He cashiered, therefore,
Sydney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concurred
in the attempt; and would have proceeded to inflict
the same punishment on Raleigh himself, had not lord
Thomas Howard interposed with his good offices, and
<PB N="398" REF="445"/>
persuaded Raleigh, tho' very high-spirited, to make sub∣missions
to the general. Essex, who was placable, as
well as hasty and passionate, was soon appeased, and
both received Raleigh into favour, and restored the
other officers to their commands<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 173.</NOTE>. This incident<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
however, tho' the quarrel was seemingly accommodated,
laid the first foundation of that violent animosity which
afterwards took place between these two gallant com∣manders.</P>
<P>ESSEX
made next a disposition proper for intercept∣ing
the Indian galleons; and Sir William Monson,
whose station was the most remote of the fleet, having
fallen in with them, made the signals which had been
agreed on. That able officer here ascribes Essex's fai∣lure
of success, when he was so near attaining so migh∣ty
an advantage, to his want of experience in seaman∣ship;
and the account which he gives of the errors
committed by that nobleman, appears very reasonable
as well as candid<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 174.</NOTE>. The Spanish fleet, finding that
their enemy was upon them, made all the sail possible
to the Terceras, and got into the safe and well forti∣fied
harbour of Angra, before the English fleet could
overtake them. Essex intercepted only three ships;
which, however, were so rich as to repay all the char∣ges
of the expedition.</P>
<P>THE causes of this miscarriage of Essex's enterprize,
were much canvassed in England, upon the return of
the fleet; and tho' the courtiers took party differently,
as they affected either Essex or Raleigh, the people, in
general, who bore an extreme affection to the gallan∣try,
spirit, and generosity of the former, were inclined
to justify every circumstance of his conduct. The
Queen, who loved the one as much as she esteemed the
other, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavour∣ed
to share her favours with an impartial hand between
the parties. Sir Robert Cecil, second son to lord Bur∣leigh,
<PB N="399" REF="446"/>
was a courtier of very promising hopes, much
connected with Raleigh; and she made him secretary
of state, instead of Sir Thomas Bodley, whom Essex
recommended for that office. But not to disgust Essex
by this preference, she promoted him to the dignity of
earl marshal of England, an office which had been va∣cant
ever since the death of the earl of Shrewsbury.
Essex might perceive from this conduct, that she never
intended to give him the entire aseendant over his rivals,
and might learn thence the necessity of moderation and
caution. But his temper was too high for submission;
his behaviour too open and candid to practice the arts
of a court; and his free sallies, while they rendered him
only more amiable in the eyes of good judges, gave his
enemies many advantages against him.</P>
<P>THE war with Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th October.</NOTE> tho' successful, having exhaust∣ed
the Queen's treasure, she was obliged to assemble
a Parliament; where Yelverton, a lawyer, was chosen
speaker of the house of commons<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It is usual for the speaker to disqualify himself for the office; but the reasons employed by this speaker are so singular, that they may be worth transcribing. “My estate,” said he, “is nothing correspondent for the maintenance of this dignity: For my father dying left me a younger brother; and nothing to me but my bare annuity. Then growing to man's estate and some small practice of the law, I took a wife, by whom I have had many children; the keeping of us all being a great impoverish∣ing to my estate, and the daily living of us all nothing but my daily in∣dustry. Neither from my person nor my nature doth this choice arise: For he that supplieth this place ought to be a man big and comely, state∣ly, and well-spoken, his voice great, his carriage majestical, his nature haughty, and his purse plentiful and heavy: But contrarily, the stature of my body is small, myself not so well spoken, my voice low, my car∣riage lawyer-like, and of the common fashion, my nature soft and bash∣ful, my purse, thin, light, and never yet plentiful.——If <HI>Demosthe∣nes,</HI> being so learned and eloquent as he was, one whom none surpassed, trembled to speak before <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocions</HI> at <HI>At<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens;</HI> how much more shall I, being unlearned and unskilful to supply the place of dignity, charge, and trouble, to speak before so many <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocions</HI> as here be? Yea, which is the greatest, before the unspeakable majesty and sacred personage of our dread and dear sovereign: The terror of whose countenance will appal and abase even the stoutest hearts; yea, whose very name will pull down the greatest courage. For how mightily do the estate and name of a prince deject the baughtiest stomach even of their greatest subjects?” D'Ewes, p. 459.</NOTE>. Elizabeth took
<PB N="400" REF="447"/>
care, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Egerton, lord keep∣er,
to inform this assembly of the necessity of a supply.
She said, that the wars formerly waged in Europe, had
commonly been conducted by the parties without far∣ther
view than to gain a few towns, or at most a pro∣vince,
from each other; but the object of the present
hostilities, on the part of Spain, was no other than ut∣terly
to bereave England of her religion, her liberty,
and her independance: That these blessings, however,
she had hitherto been enabled to preserve, in spite of
the devil, the pope, and the Spanish tyrant, and all the
mischievous designs of all her enemies: That in this
contest she had disbursed a sum treble to all the parlia∣mentary
supplies granted her; and besides expending
her ordinary revenues, had been obliged to fell many
of the crown lands: And that she could not doubt,
but her subjects, in a cause where their own honour
and interest were so deeply concerned, would willing∣ly
contribute to such moderate taxations as would be
found necessary for their common defence<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 525, 527. Townsend, p. 79.</NOTE>. The
commons granted her three subsidies and six fifteenths;
the same supply which had been given four years before,
but which had then appeared so unusual, that they had
voted it should never afterwards be regarded as a pre∣cedent.</P>
<P>THE
commons, this session, ventured to engage in
two controversies about forms with the house of peers;
a prelude to those encroachments which, as they assu∣med
more courage, they afterwards made upon the
prerogatives of the crown. They complained, that
the lords failed in civility to them, by receiving their
messages sitting with their hats on; and that the keep∣er
returned an answer in the same negligent posture:
<PB N="401" REF="448"/>
But the upper house proved, to their full satisfaction,
that they were not intitled by custom, and the usage of
Parliament, to any more respect<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 539, 540, 580, 585. Townsend, p. 93, 94, 95.</NOTE>. Some amendments
had been made by the lords, to a bill sent up by the
commons; and these amendments were wrote on parch∣ment,
and returned with the bill to the commons. The
lower house took umbrage at the novelty: They pre∣tended,
that these amendments ought to have been
wrote on paper, not on parchment; and they complain∣ed
of this innovation to the peers. The peers replied,
that they expected not such a frivolous objection from
the gravity of the house; and that it was not material,
whether the amendments were wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on parchment or
on paper, nor whether the paper was white, black, or
brown. The commons were offended with this reply,
which seemed to maintain a mockery of them; and
they complained of it, tho' without obtaining any sa∣tisfaction<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 576, 577.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN application was made, by way of petition, to the
Queen, from the lower house, against monopolies; an
abuse which had risen to an enormous height; and
they received a gracious, tho' a general answer; for
which they returned their thankful acknowledge∣ments<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 570, 573.</NOTE>. But not to give them too great encourage∣ment
in such applications, she told them, in the speech
which she delivered at their dissolution, “That with
regard to these patents, she hoped, that her dutiful
and loving subjects would not take away her prero∣gative,
which is the chief flower in her garden, and
the principal and head pearl in her crown and dia∣dem;
but that they would rather leave these matters
to her disposal<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 547.</NOTE>.” The commons also took notice,
this session, of some transactions in the court of high
<PB N="402" REF="449"/>
commission;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1598.</NOTE> but not till they had previously received
permission from her majesty to that purpose<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 557, 558.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH had reason to foresee, that parliamenta∣ry
supplies would now become more necessary to her
than ever; and that the chief burthen of the war with
Spain would thenceforth lie on England. Henry had
received an overture for a peace with Philip; but before
he would proceed to a negociation, he gave intelligence
of it to his allies the Queen and the States; that, if possi∣ble,
a general pacification might be made by common
consent and agreement. These two powers sent am∣bassadors
to France, in order to remonstrate against
peace with Spain; the Queen, Sir Robert Cecil, and
Henry Herbert; the States, Justin Nassau, and John
Barnevelt. Henry said to these ministers, that his most
early education had been amidst war and danger, and
he had passed the whole course of his life either in arms
or in military preparations: That after the proofs
which he had given of his alacrity in the field, no one
could doubt, but he would willingly, for his part, have
continued in a course of life, to which he was now
habituated, till the common enemy was reduced to
such a condition as no longer to give umbrage either
to him or to his allies: That no private interest of his
own, not even that of his people, nothing but the most
inevitable necessity, could ever induce him to think of
a separate peace with Philip, or make him embrace
measures which were not entirely formed with the ap∣probation
of all his consederates: That his kingdom,
torne with the convulsions and civil wars of near half
a century, required some interval of repose, ere it could
reach a condition in which it might sustain itself, much
more support its allies: That after the minds of his
subjects were composed to tranquillity and accustomed
to obedience, after his finances were brought into order,
<PB N="403" REF="450"/>
and after agriculture and the arts were restored<NOTE PLACE="marg">1598.</NOTE>, France,
instead of being a burthen, as at present, to her con∣federates,
would be able to lend them effectual succours,
and amply to repay them all the assistance which she
had received during her calamities: And that if the
ambition of Spain would not at present grant them such
terms as they should think reasonable, he hoped, that,
in a little time, he should attain such a situation as
would enable him to mediate more effectually, and with
more decisive authority, in their behalf.</P>
<P>THE ambassadors were sensible, that these reasons
were not feigned; and they therefore remonstrated with
the lefs vehemence against the measures which, they
saw, Henry was determined to pursue. The States
knew, that that monarch was interested never to per∣mit
their final r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in; and having received private assur∣ances,
that he would still, notwithstanding the peace,
give them assistance both of men and money, they were
well pleased to remain on terms of amity with him.
His greatest concern was to give satisfaction to Eliza∣beth
for this breach of treaty. He had a cordial esteem
for that princess, a sympathy of manners, and a gra∣titude
for the extraordinary favours which he had re∣ceived
from her, during his greatest difficulties: And
he used every expedient to apologize and atone for that
measure, which necessity extorted from him. But as
Spain refused to treat with the Dutch as a free state, and
Elizabeth would not negotiate without her ally, Henry
found himself obliged to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Vervins.</NOTE> at Vervins, a sepa∣rate
peace, by which he recovered possession of all the
places seized by Spain during the course of the civil
wars, and procured himself leizure to attend to the do∣mestic
settlement of his kingdom. His capacity for
the arts of peace were not inferior to his military ta∣lents;
and, in a little time, by his frugality, order, and
wise government, he raised France, from the desolation
and misery in which she was at present involved, to a
<PB N="404" REF="451"/>
more flourishing condition than she had ever before
enjoyed.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew, that it would be also in her
power, whenever she pleased, to conclude the war on
equitable terms, and that Philip, having no preten∣sions
upon her, would be glad to free himself from an
enemy who had foiled him in every contest, and who
had it still so much in her power to make him feel the
weight of her arms. Some of her wisest counsellors,
particularly the lord treasurer, advised her to embrace
pacific measures; and set before her the advantages of
tranquillity, security, and frugality, as more consider
able than any success which could attend the greatest
victories. But that high-spirited princess, though she
was at first averse to the war, seemed now to have
attained such an ascendant over the enemy, that she
was unwilling to stop the course of her prosperous
fortune. She considered, that her situation, and her
past victories, had given her entire security against any
dangerous invasion; and the war must henceforth be
conducted by sudden enterprizes, and naval expeditions,
in which she possessed an undoubted superiority: That
the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened to
her the view of the most desirable advantages; and the
yearly return of his treasure by sea, afforded a conti∣nual
prospect of important, though more temporary,
successes: That, after his peace with France, if she
also should consent to an accommodation, he would
be able to turn all his force against the revolted pro∣vinces
of the Netherlands, which, though they had
surprizingly increased their power by commerce and
good government, were still unable, if not supported
by their confederates, to maintain the war against so
mighty a monarchy: And that as her defence of that
commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel,
it was unsafe, as well as dishonourable, to abandon
<PB N="405" REF="452"/>
their cause, till she had placed them in a state of greater
security.</P>
<P>THESE reasons were frequently inculcated on her
by the earl of Essex, whose passion for glory, as well as
his military talents, made him earnestly desire the con∣tinuance
of that war from which he expected to reap
so much advantage and distinction. The rivalship
between this nobleman and lord Burleigh, made each
of them insist the more strenuously on his own coun∣cils;
and as Essex's person was agreeable to the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of Essex.</NOTE>
as well as his advice conformable to her inclinations,
the favourite seemed daily to acquire an ascendant
over the minister. Had he been endowed with caution
and self-command, equal to his shining qualities, he
would have so riveted himself in the Queen's con∣fidence,
that none of his enemies had ever been able to
impeach his credit: But his lofty spirit could ill submit
to that implicit deference which her temper required,
and which she had ever been accustomed to receive
from all her subjects. Being once engaged in a dispute
with her about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he
was so heated in the argument, that he entirely forgot
the rules both of duty and civility; and turned his back
upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her anger,
which was naturally prompt and violent, rose at this
provocation; and she instantly gave him a box on the
the ear; adding a passionate expression, suited to his
impertinence. Instead of recollecting himself, and
making the submissions due to her sex and station, he
clapped his hand to his sword, and swore he would not
hear such usage, were it from Henry the eighth him∣self;
and, in a great passion, he immediately with∣drew
from court. Egerton, the chancellor, who loved
Essex, exhorted him to repair his indiscretion by pro∣per
acknowlegements; and entreated him not to give
that triumph to his enemies, that affliction to his friends,
<PB N="406" REF="453"/>
which must ensue by his supporting a contest with his
sovereign, and deserting the service of his country:
But Essex was deeply stung with the dishonour which
he had received; and seemed to think, that an insult,
which might be pardoned a woman, was become a
mortal affront when it came from his sovereign. “If
the vilest of all indignities,” said he, “is done me,
does religion enforce me to sue for pardon? Doth
God require it? Is it impiety not to do it? Why?
Cannot princes err? Cannot subjects receive wrong?
Is an earthly power infinite? Pardon me, my lord,
I can never subscribe to these principles. Let Solo∣mon's
fool laugh when he is stricken; let those that
mean to make their profit of princes, shew no sense
of princes' injuries: Let them acknowleged an infinite
absoluteness on earth, that do not believe an abso∣lute
Infiniteness in heaven.” (alluding, probably, to
the character and conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh, who
lay under the reproach of impiety) “As for me,”
continued he, “I have received wrong, I feel it: My
cause is good, I know it; and whatsover happens,
all the powers on earth can never exert more
strength and constancy in oppressing, than I can
shew in suffering every thing that can or shall be
imposed upon me. Your lordship, in the begin∣ning
of your letter, makes me a player, and your∣self
a looker on: And me a player of my own
game, so you may see more than I: But give me
leave to tell you, that since you do but see, and I
do suffer, I must of necessity feel more than you<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 234. Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 386. Speed, p. 877. The whole letter is so curious and so spirited, that the reader may not be displeased to read it. “My very good lord; Tho' there is not that man this day living, whom I would sooner make judge of any question that might concern me than yourself, yet you must give me leave to tell you that in some cases I must appeal from all earthly judges: And if in any then surely in this, when the highest judge on earth had imposed on me the heaviest punishment without trial or hearing. Since then I must either answer your lordship's argument, or else forsake mine own just defence, I will force mine aching head to do me service for an hour. I must first deny my discontent, which was forced, to be an humourous discontent; and that it was unseasonable or is of so long continuing, your lordship should rather condole with me than expostulate: Natural seasons are expected here below; but violent and unreasonable storms come from above: There is no tempest equal to the passionate indig∣nation of a prince; nor yet at any time so unseasonable as when it lighten on those that might expect a harvest of their careful and pain∣ful labours. He that is once wounded, must needs feel smart, till his hurt is cured, or the part hurt become senseless: But cure I expect none, her majesty's heart being obdurate against me; and be without sense I cannot, being of flesh and blood. But, say you, I may aim at the end: I do more than aim; for I see an end of all my fortunes, I have set an end to all my desires. In this course do I any thing for my enemies? When I was at court, I found them absolute; and, therefore, I had rather they should triumph alone, than have me attendant upon their chariots. Or do I leave my friends? When I was a courtier, I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them; and now, that I am a hermit, they shall bear no envy for their love towards me. Or do I forsake myself, because I do enjoy myself? Or do I overthrow my fortunes, because I build not a fortune of paper walls, which every puff of wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine honour, because I leave following the pursuit, or wearing the false badge or mark of the shadow of honour? Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe, because I reserve myself to encounter with him? Or because I keep my heart from business, tho' I cannot keep my fortune from declining? No, no, my good lord, I give every one of these considerations its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more I find myself justified from offending in any of them. As for the two last objections, that I forsake my country, when it hath most need of me, and fail in that indissoluble duty which I owe to my sovereign; I answer, that if my country had at this time any need of my public service, her majesty, that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I am tied to my country by two bonds; one public, to discharge carefully and industriously that trust which is committed to me; the other pri∣vate, to sacrifice for it my life and carcase, which hath been nourished in it. Of the first I am free, being dismissed, discharged, and dis∣abled by her majesty: Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no occasion of my performance shall sooner offer itself but I shall meet it half way. The indissoluble duty which I owe unto her majesty, is only the duty of allegiance, which I never have, nor ever can fail in: The duty of attendance, is no indissoluble duty. I owe her majesty the duty of an earl and of lord marshal of England. I have been content to do her majesty the service of a clerk; but I can never serve her as a villain or a slave. But yet you say I must give way unto the time. So I do; for now that I see the storm come, I have put myself into the harbour. <HI>Seneca</HI> saieth, we must give way to Fortune: I know that Fortune is both blind and strong, and therefore I go as far as I can out of her way. You say, the remedy is not to strive: I neither strive nor seek for remedy. But, you say, I must yield and submit: I can neither yield myself to be guilty, nor allow the imputation laid upon me to be just: I owe so much to the Author of all truth, as I can never yield truth to be falsehood, nor falsehood to be truth. Have I given cause, you ask; and yet take a scandal when I have done? No: I gave no cause, not so much as <HI>Fimbria</HI>'s complaint against me; for I did <HI>totum telum corpore recipere:</HI> Receive the whole sword into my body. I patiently bear all, and sensibly feel all that I then received, when this scandal was given me. Nay more, when the vilest of all indignities are done unto me,” &amp;c.

<P><PB N="407" REF="454"/>
THIS spirited letter was shown by Essex to his
friends;; and they were so imprudent as to disperse
<PB N="408" REF="455"/>
copies of it:: Yet notwithstanding this additional pro∣vocation,
the Queen's partiality was so prevalent, that
she reinstated him in his former favour; and her kind∣ness
to him appeared rather to have acquired new
force from that short interruption of anger and resent∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">4
August.</NOTE> The death of lord Burleigh, his antagonist,
which happened about this time, seemed to ensure him
a constant possession of the Queen's confidence; and
nothing indeed but his own indiscretion could thence∣forth
have shaken his well-established credit. Lord
Burleigh died in an advanced age; and by a rare for∣tune,
was equally regretted by his sovereign and the
people. He had risen gradually, from small begin∣nings,
by the mere force of merit; and though his
authority was never entirely absolute, or uncontrouled
with the Queen, he was still, during a course of near
forty years, regarded as her principal minister. None
of her other inclinations or affections could ever over∣come
her confidence in so useful a counsellor; and as
he had had the generosity or good sense to pay assi∣duous
court to her, during her sister's reign, when it
<PB N="409" REF="456"/>
was dangerous to appear her friend, she thought her∣self
bound in gratitude, when she mounted the throne,
to persevere in her attachments to him. He seems not
to have possessed any shining talents of address, elo∣quence,
or imagination; and was chiefly distinguished
by solidity of understanding, probity of manners, and
indesatigable application in business: Virtues, which,
if they do not always enable a man to rise to high sta∣tions,
do certainly qualify him best for filling them.
Of al the Queen's ministers he was the only one who
left a considerable fortune to his posterity; a fortune
not acquired by rapine or oppression, but gained by the
regular profits of his offices, and preserved by fru∣gality.</P>
<P>THE
last act of this able minister was the conclud∣ing
a new treaty with the Dutch<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 August.</NOTE>; who, after being,
in some measure, deserted by the King of France,
were glad to preserve the Queen's alliance, by sub∣mitting
to any terms which she pleased to require of
them. The debt which they owed the Queen, was
now fixed at eight hundred thousand pounds; Of this
sum they agreed to pay, during the war, thirty thou∣sand
pounds a year; and these payments were to con∣tinue
till four hundred thousand pounds of the debt
should be extinguished. They engaged also, during
the time that England should continue the war with
Spain, to pay the garrison of the cautionary towns.
They stipulated, that, if Spain should invade England,
or the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Wight, or Jersey, or Scilly, they should
assist her with a body of five thousand foot, and five
hundred horses and that in case she undertook any
naval armament against Spain, they should join an
equal number of ships to hers<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 340.</NOTE> By this treaty the
Queen was eased of an annual charge of an hundred
and twenty thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="457"/>
Soon after the death of Burleigh, the Queen, who
regreted extremely the loss of so wise and faithful a
minister, was informed of the death of her capital
enemy, Philip the second; who, after languishing un∣der
many infirmities, expired in an advanced age at
Madrid. This haughty prince, desirous of an accom∣modation
with his revolted subjects in the Netherlands,
but disdaining to make in his own name the conces∣sions
requisite for that purpose, had transferred to his
daughter, married to the archduke Albert, the property
of the Low Country provinces; but as it was not ex∣pected,
that that princess could have any posterity, and
as the reversion, in case of the failure of her issue, was
still reserved to the crown of Spain, the States con∣sidered
this deed only as the change of a name, and
persisted with equal obstinacy in their resistance to the
Spanish arms. The other states also of Europe made
no distinction between the courts of Brussels and Ma∣drid;
and the secret opposition of France, as well as
the avowed force of England, continued to operate
against the progress of Albert, as it had done against
that of Philip.</P>

<P>THO' the dominion of the English over Ireland
had been established above four centuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIV.</NOTE> it may
safely be affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1599.</NOTE> that their authority had hitherto been
little more than nominal. The Irish princes and nobles,
divided among themselves, readily paid the exterior
marks of obe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sance to a power which they were not
able to resist; but, as no durable force was ever kept
on foot to retain them to their duty, they relapsed still
into their former state of independance. Too weak
to introduce order and obedience among the rude in∣habitants,
the English authority was yet sufficient to
check the growth of any enterprizing genius among
the natives: And tho' it could bestow no true form of
civil government, it was able to prevent the rise of any
such form, from the internal combination or policy of
the Irish<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Most of the English institutions likewise, by which
that island was governed, were to the last degree absurd,
and such as no state before had ever thought of, for
the preserving dominion over its conquered provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="459"/>
THE English nation, all on fire for the project of
subduing France, a project, whose success was the
most improbable, and would to them have proved the
most pernicious; neglected all other enterprizes, to
which their situation so strongly invited them, and
which, in time, would have brought them an accession
of riches, grandeur, and security. The small army
which they maintained in Ireland, they never supplied
regularly with pay; and as no money could be levied
from the island, which possessed none, they gave their
soldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the natives.
Rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred, which pre∣vailed
between the conquerors and the conquered:
Want of security among the Irish, introducing de∣spair,
nourished still farther the sloth, so natural to that
uncultivated people.</P>
<P>BUT the English carried farther their ill-judged ty∣ranny.
Instead of inviting the Irish, to adopt the more
civilized customs of their conquerors, they even refused,
though earnestly sollicited, to communicate to them
the privilege of their laws, and every where marked
them out as aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of
the protection of justice, the natives could find no se∣curity
but in force; and flying the neighbourhood of
cities, which they could not approach with safety,
they sheltered themselves in their marshes and forests
from the insolence of their inhuman masters. Being
treated like wild beasts, they became such; and join∣ing
the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed bar∣barity,
they grew every day more intractable and
dangerous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 102, 103, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the English princes deemed the conquest of the
dispersed Irish to be more the object of time and pa∣tience
than the source of military glory, they willingly
delegated that office to private adventurers, who in∣listing
<PB N="413" REF="460"/>
soldiers at their own charge, conquered provinces
of that island, which they converted to their own
profit. Separate jurisdictions and principalities were
eftablished by these lordly conquerors: The power of
peace and war was assumed: Military law was exer∣cised
over the Irish, whom they subdued, and, by de∣grees,
over the English, by whose assistance they con∣quered:
And, after their dominion had once taken
root, deeming the English institutions less favourable
to barbarous empire, they degenerated into mere Irish,
and abandoned the garb, language, manners and laws
of their native country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 133. 134. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By all this imprudent conduct of England, the na∣tives
of its dependant state, remained still in that ab∣ject
condition, into which the northern and western
parts of Europe were sunk, before they received civility
and slavery from the refined policy and irresistible bra∣very
of Rome. Even at the end of the sixteenth cen∣tury,
when every christian nation was cultivating with
ardour every civil art of life, that island, lying in a
temperate climate, enjoying a fertile soil, accessible in
its situation, possessed of innumerable harbours, was
still, notwithstanding these advantages, inhabited by a
people, whose customs and manners approached nearer
those of savages than of barbarians.</P>
<P>As the brutality and ignorance of the Irish was ex∣treme,
they were sunk below the reach of that cu∣riosity
and love of novelty, by which every other people
in Europe had been seized at the beginning of that
century, and which had engaged them in innovations
and religious disputes, with which they were still so vio∣lently
agitated. The antient superstition, the practises
and observances of their fathers, mingled and polluted
with many wild opinions, still maintained an unshaken
empire over them; and the example alone of the
<PB N="414" REF="461"/>
English was sufficient to render the resormation odious
to the prejudiced and discontented Irish. The old op∣position
of manners, laws, and interest, was now in∣flamed
by religious antipathy; and the subduing and
civilizing that country seemed to become every day
more difficult and more impracticable.</P>
<P>THE animosity against the English was carried so
far by the Irish, that, in an insurrection, raised by two
sons of the earl of Clanricard, they put to the sword
all the inhabitants of the town of Athenry, tho' Irish;
because they began to conform themselves to English
customs and institutions, and had embraced a more
cultivated and civilized form of life, than had been
practised by their barbarous ancestors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 457.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE usual revenue of Ireland amounted only to six
thousand pounds a year<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Sidneys, vol. I. p. 86.</NOTE>: The Queen, though with
much repining<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 342. Sydney, vol. I. p. 85, 200.</NOTE>, commonly added twenty thousand
more, which she remitted from England: And with
this small revenue, a body of one thousand men was
supported, which, in extraordinary emergencies was
angmented to two thousand<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 542. Sydney, vol I. p. 65, 109, 133, 184.</NOTE>. No wonder that a
force, so disproportioned to the occasion, instead of
subduing a mutinous kingdom, served rather to pro∣voke
the natives, and to excite those frequent insur∣rections
and rebellions, which still farther inflamed the
animosity between the two nations, and encreased the
barbarity and disorders, to which the Irish were natu∣rally
subject.</P>
<P>IN 1560, Shan O'Neale, or the great O'Neale, as
the Irish called him, because head of that potent clan,
raised a rebellion in Ulster; and after some skirmishes,
was received into favour, upon his submission, and his
promise of a more dutiful behaviour for the future<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 385, 391.</NOTE>.
<PB N="415" REF="462"/>
This impunity tempted him to undertake a new insur∣rection
in 1567; but being pushed by Sir Henry Sidney,
lord deputy, he retreated into Clandeboy, and rather
than submit to the English, he put himself into the
hands of some Scots islanders, who commonly infested
those parts by their incursions. The Scots, who re∣tained
a quarrel against him on account of former in∣juries,
violated the laws of hospitality, and murdered
him in a festival, to which they had invited him. He
was a man equally noted for his pride, his violences,
his debaucheries, and his hatred of the English nation.
He is said to have put some of his followers to death,
because they endeavoured to introduce the use of bread
after the English fashion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 409.</NOTE>. Tho' so violent an enemy
to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot; and was
accustomed, after his intemperance had thrown him
into a fever, to plunge his body into mire, that he
might allay the flame, which he had raised by former
excesses<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 409. Cox, p. 324.</NOTE>. Such was the life led by this haughty
barabarian, who scorned the title of earl of Tyrone,
which Elizabeth intended to have restored to him, and
who assumed the rank and appellation of King of
Ulster. He used also to say, that tho' the Queen was
his sovereign lady, he never made peace with her but
at her seeking<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 321.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR Henry Sidney was one of the wisest and most
active governors whom Ireland had enjoyed for feveral
reigns<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 350.</NOTE>; and he possessed his authority eleven years;
during which time, he struggled with many difficulties,
and made some progress in repressing those disorders,
which had become inveterate among that people. The
earl of Desmond, in 1569, gave him disturbance from
the hereditary animosity which prevailed between that
nobleman and the earl of Ormond, who was descended

from the only family, established in Ireland, that had
ever steddily maintained its loyalty to the English
crown<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 424.</NOTE>. The earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted
a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged to fly into
France, before his designs were ripe for execution.
Stukeley, another fugitive, found such credit with the
pope, Gregory the 13th, that he flattered his holiness
with the prospect of making his nephew, Buon Com∣pagno,
King of Ireland; and as if this project had al∣ready
taken effect, he accepted the title of marquiss of
Leinster from the new sovereign<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 430. Cox, p. 354.</NOTE>. He passed next
into Spain; and after having received much encourage∣ment
and great rewards from Philip, who intended to
make use of him as an instrument to disturb Queen
Elizabeth, he was found to possess too little interest for
executing those high promises, which he had made to
that monarch. He retired into Portugal; and follow∣ing
the fortunes of Don Sebastian, he perished with
that gallant prince in his bold but fatal expedition a∣gainst
the Moors.</P>
<P>LORD Gray succeeded Sydney in the government of
Ireland; and, in 1579, suppressed a new rebellion of
the earl of Desmond, though supported by a body of
Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks
followed a few years after; occasioned by the strict and
equitable administration of Sir Richard Bingham, go∣vernor
of Connaught, who endeavoured to repress the
tyranny of the chieftains over their vassals<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 720.</NOTE>. The
Queen, finding Ireland so burthensome to her, tried
several expedients for reducing it to a state of greater
order and submission. She encouraged the earl of Essex,
father to that nobleman, who was afterwards her fa∣vourite,
to attempt the subduing and planting Clande∣boy,
Ferny, and other territories, part of some late
<PB N="417" REF="468"/>
forfeitures: But that enterprize proved unfortunate;
and Essex died of a distemper, occasioned, as is supposed,
by the vexation, which he had conceived, from his
disappointments. An university was founded in Dublin
with a view of introducing arts and learning into that
kingdom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of
the inhabitants<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 566.</NOTE>. But the most unhappy expedient,
employed in the government of Ireland, was that made
use of in 1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time lord
deputy: He put arms into the hands of the Irish inha∣bitants
of Ulster, in order to enable them, without
the assistance of the government, to repress the incur∣sions
of the Scots islanders, by which these parts were
much infested<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Naneon's Fragmenta Regalia, p. 203.</NOTE>. At the same time, the invitations of
Philip, joined to their zeal for the catholic religion,
engaged many of the gentry to serve in the Low
Country wars; and thus Ireland, being provided both
of officers and soldiers, of discipline and arms, became
formidable to the English, and was thenceforth able
to maintain a more regular war against her antient
masters.</P>
<P>HUGH O'Neale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrone's rebellio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> nephew to Shan O'Neale, had been
raised by the Queen to the dignity of earl of Tyrone;
but having murdered his cousin, son to that rebel, and
being acknowleged head of his clan, he preferred the
pride of barbarous licence and dominion, to the plea∣fures
of opulence and tranquillity, and fomented all
those disorders, by which he hoped to weaken or over∣turn
the English government. He was noted for the
vices of perfidy and cruelty, so common among uncul∣tivated
nations; and was also eminent for courage,
a virtue, which their disorderly course of life requires,
and which, notwithstanding, being unsupported by
the principle of honour, is commonly more precarious
among them, than among a civilized people. Tyrone,
actuated by this spirit, fecretly formented the discontents
of the Maguires, Odonnels, O'Rourks, Macmahons,
<PB N="418" REF="469"/>
and other rebels; yet trusting to the influence of his
deceitful oaths and professions, he put himself into the
hands of Sir William Russel, who, in the year 1594,
was sent over lord deputy into Ireland. Contrary to
the advice and protestation of Sir Henry Bagnal, mar∣shal
of the army, he was dismissed; and returning to
his own country, he embraced the resolution of raising
an open rebellion, and of relying no longer on the
lenity or inexperience of the English government. He
entered into a correspondence with Spain: He procured
thence a supply of arms and ammunition: And having
united all the Irish chieftains in a dependance upon
himself, he began to be regarded as a formidable
enemy.</P>
<P>THE native Irish were so miserably poor, that their
country afforded few other commodities but cattle and
oatmeal, which were easily destroyed or driven away on
the approach of the enemy; and as Elizabeth was
averse to the expence requisite for supporting her armies,
the English found much difficulty in pushing their ad∣vantages,
and in pursuing the rebels into the bogs,
woods, and other fastnesses, to which they retreated.
These motives made Sir John Norris, who commanded
the English army, the more ready to hearken to any
proposals of truce or accommodation made him by
Tyrone; and after the war was spun out by these arti∣fices
for some years, that gallant Englishman, finding
that he had been deceived by treacherous promises, and
that he had performed nothing worthy of his antient
reputation, was seized with a languishing distemper,
and died of vexation and discontent. Sir Henry
Bagnal, who succeeded him in the command, was
still more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the
fort of Black-water, besieged by the rebels, he was
surrounded in disadvantageous ground; his soldiers,
discouraged by part of their powder's accidentally
taking fire, were put to flight; and, tho' the pursuit
was stopt by Montacute, who commanded the English
horse, fifteen hundred men, together with the general
<PB N="419" REF="470"/>
himself, were left dead upon the spot. This victory,
so unusual to the Irish, mightly raised their spirits,
supplied them with arms and ammunition, and exalted
the reputation of Tyrone, who assumed the character
of the deliverer of his country, and patron of Irish
liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 415.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English council were now sensible that the
rebellion of Ireland was come to a dangerous head,
and that the former temporizing arts, of granting
truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing
them to purchase pardons by resigning part of the
plunder, acquired during their insurrections, served
only to encourage the spirit of mutiny and disorder
among them. It was therefore resolved to push the
war by more vigorous measures; and the Queen cast
her eye on Charles Blount, lord Mountjoy, as a man,
who, tho' hitherto less accustomed to arms than to
books and literature, was endowed, she thought, with
talents equal to that undertaking. But the young earl
of Essex, ambitious of glory, and desirous of obtaining
this government for himself, opposed the choice of
Mountjoy; and represented the necessity of appointing,
for that important employment, some person more ex∣perienced
in war than this nobleman, more practised
in business, and of higher quality and reputation. By
this description, he was understood to mean himself<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>;
and no sooner was his desire known, to be possessed of
that government, than his enemies, even more zea∣lously
than his friends, conspired to render his wishes
effectual. Many of his friends thought, that he never
ought to consent, except for a very short time, to
accept of employments which must remove him from
court, and prevent him from cultivating that per∣sonal
inclination, which the Queen so visibly bore
him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p: 79.</NOTE>. His enemies hoped, that if, by his absence,
she had once leizure to forget the charms of his person
<PB N="420" REF="471"/>
and conversation, his impatient and lofty demeanor
would soon disgust a princess, who usually exacted
such profound submission and implicit obedience from
all her servants. But Essex was incapable of entering
into such cautious views; and even Elizabeth, who
was extremely desirous of subduing the Irish rebels,
and who was much prepossessed in favour of Essex's
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Essex sent over to Ireand.</NOTE> readily agreed to appoint him governor of Ire∣land,
under the title of lord lieutenant. The more to
encourage him in his undertaking, she granted him by
his patent more extensive authority than had ever before
been conserred on any lieutenant; the power of car∣rying
on or finishing the war as he pleased, of par∣doning
the rebels, and of filling all the most consider∣able
employments of the kingdom<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 366.</NOTE>. And to ensure
him of success, she levied a numerous army of sixteen
thousand foot and thirteen hundred horse, which she
afterwards augmented to twenty thousand foot and
two thousand horse: A force, which, it was appre∣hended,
would be able, in one campaign, to overwhelm
the rebels, and make an entire conquest of Ireland.
Nor did Essex's enemies, the earl of Nottingham, lord
admiral, Sir Robert Cecil, secretary, Sir Walter Ra∣leigh,
and lord Cobham, throw any obstacles in the
way of these preparations; but hoped, that the higher
the Queen's expectations were raised of success, the
more difficult it would be for the event to corres∣pond
to them. In a like view, they rather seconded,
than opposed, those exalted encomiums, which Essex's
numerous and sanguine friends dispersed, of his high
genius, of his elegant endowments, his heroic courage,
his unbounded generosity, and his noble birth; nor
were they displeased to observe that passionate fondness,
which the people every where expressed for this noble∣man.
These artful politicians had studied his character;
and finding, that his open and undaunted
<PB N="421" REF="472"/>
spirit, if taught temper and reserve from opposition,
must become invincible, they resolved rather to give
full breath to those sails, which were already too much
expanded, and to push him upon dangers, of which
he seemed to make such small account<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden. Osborne, p. 371.</NOTE>. And the
better to make advantage of his indiscretions, spies
were set upon all his actions and even expressions;
and his vehement spirit, which, while he was in the
midst of the court and environed by his rivals, was
unacquainted with disguise, could not fail, after he
thought himself surrounded by none but friends, to
give a pretence for malignant suspicions and construc∣tions.</P>
<P>ESSEX
left London in the month of March, at∣tended
by the acclamations of the populace, and what
did him more honour, accompanied by a numerous
train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to
his person, had attached themselves to all his fortunes,
and proposed to acquire fame and military experience
under so renowned a commander. The first act of
authority, which he exercised, after his arrival in Ire∣land,
was an indiscretion, but of the generous kind;
and in both these respects, suitable to his character.
He appointed his intimate friend, the earl of South∣ampton,
general of the horse; a nobleman, who had
displeased the Queen by secretly marrying without her
consent, and whom she had therefore enjoined Essex
not to employ in any command under him. She no
sooner heard of this instance of disobedience than she
reprimanded him, and ordered him to recal his com∣mission
to Southampton. But Essex, who had ima∣gined,
that some reasons, which he opposed to her first
injunctions, had convinced her, had the imprudence
to remonstrate against these second orders<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 421, 451.</NOTE>; and it
was not till she reiterated her commands, that he could
be prevailed on to displace his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="473"/>
ESSEX, on his landing at Dublin, had deliberated
with the Irish council, concerning the proper methods
of carrying on war against the rebels; and here he
was guilty of a capital error, which was the ruin of
his enterprize. He had always, while in England,
blamed the conduct of former commanders, who art∣fully
protracted the war, who harrassed their troops in
small enterprizes, and who, by agreeing to truces
and temporary pacifications with the rebels, had given
them leizure to recruit their broken forces<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 431. Bacon vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>. In con∣formity
to these views, he had ever insisted upon lead∣ing
his forces immediately into Ulster against Tyrone,
the capital enemy; and his instructions had been
drawn agreeably to these his declared intentions and
resolutions. But the Irish counsellors persuaded him,
that the season was too early for the enterpize, and
that as the morasses, in which the Irish usually sheltered
themselves, would not, as yet, be passabel to the English
forces, it would be better to employ the present time
in an expedition into Munster. Their secret reason for
this advice was, that many of them possessed estates
in that province, and were desirous to have the enemy
dislodged from their neighbourhood<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 448.</NOTE>: But the same
selfish spirit, which had induced them to give this
council, made them soon after disown it, when they
found the bad consequences with which it was at∣tended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX obliged all the rebels of Munster either to
submit or to fly into the neighbouring provinces: But
as the Irish, from the greatness of the Queen's pre∣parations,
had concluded, that she intended to reduce
them to total subjection, or even utterly to exterminate
them, they considered their present defence as a com∣mon
cause; and the English forces were no sooner
withdrawn, than the inhabitants of Munster relapsed
into rebellion, and renewed their confederacy with
<PB N="423" REF="474"/>
their other countrymen. The army, meanwhile, by
the fatigue of long and tedious marches, and by the
influence of the climate, was become extreme sickly;
and on their return to Dublin, about the middle of
July, were suprizingly diminished in number. Their
courage was even much abated: For tho' they had
prevailed in some lesser enterprizes, as against the lord
Cahir and others; yet had they sometimes met with
more stout resistance than they expected from the Irish,
whom they were wont to despise; and as they were
raw troops and unexperienced, a considerable body of
them had been put to flight at the Glins, by an inferior
number of the enemy. Essex was so enraged at this
misbehaviour, that he cashiered all the officers, and
decimated the private man<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>. But this instance of se∣verity,
tho' necessary, had intimidated the soldiers, and
had encreased their aversion to the present service.</P>
<P>THE Queen was extremely disgusted, when she
heard, that so considerable a part of the season was
consumed in these frivolous enterprizes; and was still
more surprized, that Essex persevered in the same
practice, which he had so much condemned in others.
and which he knew to be so much contrary to her
purpose and intention. That nobleman, in order to
give his troops leizure to recruit from their sickness
and fatigue, marched with a small body of fifteen
hundred men into the county of Ophelie against the
O'Connors and O'Mores, whom he forced to a sub∣mission:
But, on his return to Dublin, he found the
army so extremely diminished, that he wrote to the
English council an account of his condition, and
informed them, that, if he received not immediately a
reinforcement of two thousand men, it would be im∣possible
for him this season to attempt any thing
against Tyrone. That there might be no pretence
for farther inactivity, the Queen immediately sent over
<PB N="424" REF="475"/>
the number demanded<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 430. Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>; and Essex began at last to
assemble his forces for the expedition into Ulster. The
army was so extremely averse to this enterprize, and
terrisied with the reputation of Tyrone, that many
of them counterfeited sickness, many of them de∣serted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 112, 113.</NOTE>; and Essex found, that after leaving the ne∣cessary
garrisons, he could scarce lead four thou∣sand
men against the rebels. He marched, however,
with this small army; but was soon sensible, that,
in so advanced a season, it would be impossible for him
to effectuate any thing against an enemy, who, tho'
superior in number, were determined to avoid every
decisive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a mes∣sage
sent him by Tyrone, who desired a conference;
and a place, near the two camps, was accordingly ap∣pointed.
The generals met without any of their at∣tendants,
and a river ran between them, into which
Tyrone entered to the depth of his sadlde: But Essex
stood on the opposite bank. After half an hour's con∣ference,
where Tyrone behaved with great submission
and respect to the lord lieutenant, a cessation of arms
was concluded to the first of May, renewable from
six weeks to six weeks; but which might be broke off
by either party upon a fornight's warning<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 125.</NOTE>. Essex
also received from Tyrone proposals for a peace, in
which that rebel had inserted many unreasonable and
exorbitant conditions: And there appeared afterwards
some reason to suspect, that he had here commenced
a very unjustifiable correspondence with the enemy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 307. State Trials. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 514, 535. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So unexpected an issue of an enterprize, the greatest
and most expensive which Elizabeth had ever under∣taken,
provoked her extremely against Essex; and this
disgust was much augmented by other circumstances
of that nobleman's conduct. He wrote many letters
to the Queen and council, full of peevish and impa∣tient
<PB N="425" REF="476"/>
expressions; complaining of his enemies, la∣menting
that their calumnies should be believed against
him, and discovering symptoms of a mind, equally
haughty and discontented. She took care to inform
him of her dissatisfaction; but commanded him to
remain in Ireland till farther orders.</P>
<P>ESSEX heard at once of Elizabeth's anger, and of
the promotion of his enemies, Sir Robert Cecil, to
the office of master of the wards, an office which he
himself aspired to: And dreading, that, if he remained
any longer absent, the Queen would be totally ali∣enated
from him, he hastily embraced a resolution,
which, he knew, had once succeeded with the earl of Leicester, the former favourite of Elizabeth. Leicester
being informed, while in the Low Countries, that his
mistress was extremely displeased with his conduct,
disobeyed her orders by coming over into England;
and having pacified her by his presence, by his apo∣logies,
and by his flattery and insinuation, disappointed
all the expectations of his enemies<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 453.</NOTE>. Essex, therefore,
weighing more the similarity of circumstances than
the difference of characters between himself and
Leicester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to England.</NOTE> immediately set out for England; and mak∣ing
speedy journeys, he arrived at court before any
one was in the least apprized of his intentions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 118.</NOTE>.
Tho' besmeared with dirt and sweat, he hastened up
stairs to the presence chamber, thence to the privy-chamber;
nor stopped till he was in the Queen's
bed chamber, who was newly risen, and was sitting
with her hair about her face. He threw himself on
his knees, kissed her hand, and had some private con∣ference
with her; where he was so graciously received,
that, on his departure, he was heard to express great
satisfaction, and to thank God, that, tho' he had suffered
much trouble and many storms abroad, he found a sweet
calm at home<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="477"/>
BUT this placability of Elizabeth was merely the
result of her surprize, and of the momentary satisfac∣tion
which she felt on the sudden and unexpected ap∣pearance
of her favourite: After she had leizure for
recollection, all his faults recurred to her memory;
and she thought it necessary by some severe discipline,
to subdue his haughty and imperious spirit, who, pre∣suming
on her partiality and indulgence, had pretended
to domineer in her councils, to engross all her favour,
and to act, in the most important affairs, without re∣gard
to her orders and instructions. When Essex
waited on her in the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is disgraced.</NOTE> he found her extremely
altered in her carriage towards him: She ordered him
to be confined to his chamber; to be twice examined
by the council; and tho' his answers were calm and
submissive, she committed him to the custody of the
lord keeper, Egerton, and held him sequestered from
all company, even from that of his countess, nor was so
much as the intercourse of letters permitted between
them. Essex dropped many expressions of humiliation
and sorrow, none of resentment: He professed an entire
submission to the Queen's will: Declared his intention
of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth
a private life, remote from courts and business: But
tho' he affected to be so entirely cured of his aspiring
ambition, the vexation of this disappointment, and of
the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon his
haughty spirit; and he fell into a distemper, which
seemed to put his life in hazard.</P>
<P>THE Queen had always declared to all the world,
and even to the earl himself, that the purpose of her
severity was to correct, not to ruin him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444, 445. Sydney Papers, vol. II. p. 196.</NOTE>; and when
she heard of his condition, she was not a little alarmed
with the danger. She ordered eitht physicians of the
best reputation and experience to consult of his cafe;
<PB N="427" REF="478"/>
and being informed, that the issue was much to be ap∣prehended,
she sent Dr. James to him with some broth,
and desired that physician to deliver him a message,
which she probably deemed of still greater virtue;
that, if she thought such a step consistent with her
honour, she would herself pay him a visit. They by∣standers,
who carefully observed her countenance,
remarked, that in pronouncing these words, her eyes
were sussused with tears<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sydney Letters, vol. II. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN these symptoms of the Queen's returning
affection towards Essex were known, they gave a sen∣sible
alarm to the faction which had declared their
opposition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh, in particular,
the most violent as well as the most ambitious of his
enemies, was so affected with the appearance of that
sudden revolution, that he was seized with sickness in
his turn, and the Queen was obliged to apply the same
salve to his wound, and to send him a favourable mes∣sage,
expressing her desire of his recovery<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE medicine which the Queen administered to
these aspiring rivals, was successful with both; and
Essex, being now allowed the company of his countess,
and having entertained more promising hopes of his
future for tunes, was so much restored in his health,
as to be thought past all danger. A belief was infused
into Elizabeth, that his distemper had been entirely
counterseit, in order to move her compassion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 153.</NOTE>; and
she relapsed into her former rigour against him. He
wrote her a letter, and sent her a rich present on New-Year's
day; as was usual among the courtiers of that
time: She read the letter, but rejected the present<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 155, 156.</NOTE>.
After some interval, however, of severity, she allowed
him to retire to his own house: And tho' he remained
still under custody, and was sequestered from all com∣pany,
<PB N="428" REF="479"/>
he was so grateful for this mark of lenity, that
he sent her a letter of thanks on the occasion. “This
farther degree of goodness,” said he, “doth sound
in mine ears, as if your majesty spake these words,
<HI>Die not, Essex; for tho' I punish thine offencs, and
humble thee for thy good, yet will I one day be served
again by thee.</HI> My prostrate soul makes this answer.
<HI>I hope for that blessed day.</HI> And in expectation of it,
all my afflictions of body or mind are humbly, pati∣ently,
and chearfully borne by me<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444.</NOTE>.” The coun∣tess
of Essex, daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham,
possessed, as well as her husband, a very refined taste
in literature; and the chief consolation which Essex
enjoyed, during this period of anxiety and expectation,
consisted in her company, and in reading with her those
instructive and entertaining authors which, even during
the time of his greatest prosperity, he had never entirely
neglected.</P>
<P>THERE were several incidents which kept alive
the Queen's anger against Essex. Every account which
she received from Ireland, convinced her more and
more of his misconduct in that government, and of the
insignificant purposes to which he had employed so
much force and treasure, Tyrone, so far from being
quelled, had thought proper, in less than three months,
to break the truce, and joining with O Donel, and
other rebels, had over-run almost the whole kingdom.
He boasted, that he was certain of receiving a supply of
men, money, and arms from Spain: He pretended to
be champion of the catholic religion: And he loudly
exulted in the present of a phoenix plume, which
the pope, Clement the eighth, in order to encourage
him in the prosecution of so good a cause, had con∣secrated,
and had conferred upon him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 617.</NOTE>. The Queen,
that she might check his progress, returned to her for∣mer
intention, of appointing Mountjoy lord-deputy;
and tho' that nobleman, who was an intimate friend
<PB N="429" REF="480"/>
of Essex, and desired his return to the government of
Ireland, did at first very earnestly excuse himself, on
account of his bad state of health, she obliged him
to accept of that employment. Mountjoy found the
island almost in a desperate situation; but being a
man of capacity and vigour, he was so little discouraged,
that he immediately advanced against Tyrone in Ulster.
He peetrated into the heart of that country, the chief
seat of the rebels: He fortified Derry and Mount-Norris,
in order to bridle the Irish: He chaced them
from the field, and obliged them to take shelter in the
woods and morasses: He employed, with equal suc∣cess,
Sir Gorge Carew in Munster: And by these pro∣mising
successes, he gave new life to the Queen's autho∣rity
in that country.</P>
<P>As the comparison of Mountjoy's administration
with that of Essex, contributed to alienate Elizabeth
from her favourite, she received additional disgust from
the partiality of the people, who, prepossessed with an
extravagant idea of Essex's merit, complained of the
injustice which was done him, by his removal from
court, and by his confinement. Libels were secretly
dispersed against Cecil and Raleigh, and all his ene∣mies.
And his popularity, which was always great,
seemed rather to be increased than diminished by his
misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to justify to the
public her conduct with regard to him, had often
expressed her intentions of having him tried in the star-chamber,
for his offences: But her tenderness for him
prevailed at last over her severity; and she was con∣tented
to have him only examined by the privy-council.
The attorney-general, Coke, opened the
cause against him, and treated him with the cruelty
and insolence which that great lawyer usually exercised
against the unfortunate. He displayed, in the strongest
colours, all the faults committed by Essex in his ad∣ministration
of Ireland: His making Southampton ge∣neral
<PB N="430" REF="481"/>
of the horse, contrary to the Queen's injunctions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his deserting the enterprize against Tyrone, and march∣ing
to Leinster and Munster; his conferring knight∣hood
on too many persons; his secret conference
with Tyrone; and his sudden return from Ireland,
in contempt of her majesty's commands. He also
exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which
Tyrone had been allowed to propose; odious and abo∣minable
conditions, said he; a public toleration of an
idolatrous religion, pardon for himself and every traitor
in Ireland, and full restitution of lands and possessions
to all of them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 449.</NOTE>. The sollicitor-general, Fleming,
insisted upon the wretched situation in which the earl
had left that kingdom; and Francis Bacon, son to
Sir Nicholas Bacon, who had been lord keeper in the
beginning of the present reign, closed the charge with
displaying the undutiful expressions contained in some
letters wrote by the earl.</P>
<P>ESSEX, when his turn came to plead in his own
behalf, renounced, with great submission and humility,
all pretensions to an apology<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200.</NOTE>; and declared his reso∣lution
never, on this or any other occasion, to have
any contest with his sovereign. He said, that having
severed himself from the world, and abjured all senti∣ments
of ambition, he had no scruple to confess every
failing or error into which his youth, folly, or mani∣fold
infirmities might have betrayed him; that his
inward sorrow for his offences against her majesty
was so profound, that it exceeded all his outward crosses
and afflictions, nor did he retain any scruple of submit∣ting
to a public confession of whatever she had been
pleased to impute to him; that in his acknowledge∣ments
he retained only one reserve, which he never
would relinquish but with his life, the assertion of a
loyal and unpolluted heart, of an unfeigned affection,
<PB N="431" REF="482"/>
of an earnest desire ever to perform to her majesty the
best service which his poor abilities would permit; and
that if this sentiment was recognized by the council,
he willingly acquiesced in any condemnation or sen∣tence
which they could pronounce against him. This
submission was uttered with so much eloquence, and
in so pathetic a manner, that it drew tears from many
of the spectators<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200, 201.</NOTE>. All the privy-counsellors, in
giving their judgment, made no scruple of doing the
earl justice, with regard to the loyalty of his intentions.
Even Cecil, whom he believed his capital enemy,
treated him with regard and humanity. And the
sentence given by the lord keeper, (to which the council
assented) was in these words. “If this cause,” said
he, “had been heard in the Star-chamber, my sen∣tence
must have been for as great a fine as ever
was set upon any man's head in that court, together
with perpetual confinement in that prison which
belongeth to a man of his quality, the Tower.
But since we are now in another place, and in a
course of favour, my censure is, that the earl of
Essex is not to execute the office of a counsellor, nor
that of earl marshal of England, nor of master of
the ordnance; and to return to his own house, there
to contiue a prisoner, till it shall please her majesty to
release this and all the rest of his sentence<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 454. Camden, p. 626, 627.</NOTE>.” The
earl of Cumberland made a slight opposition to
this sentence; and said, that, if he thought it would
stand, he would have required a little longer time to
deliberate; that he thought it somewhat severe; and
that any commander in chief might easily incur a
like penalty. But, however, added he, in confidence
of her majesty's mercy, I agree with the rest. The
earl of Worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of
<PB N="432" REF="483"/>
Latin verses, implying, that, where the Gods are of∣fended,
even misfortunes ought to be imputed as
crimes, and that accident is no excuse for transgressions
against the Divinity.</P>
<P>BACON, so much distinguished afterwards by his
high offices, and still more by his profound genius for
the sciences, was nearly allied to the Cecil family,
being nephew to lord Burleigh, and cousin-german
to the secretary: But notwithstanding his extraordi∣nary
talents, he had met with so little protection from
his powerful relations, that he had not yet obtained
any preserment in the law, which was his profession;
But Essex, who could distinguish merit, and who pas∣sionately
loved it, had entered into an intimate friend∣ship
with Bacon; had zealously attempted, tho' with∣out
success, to procure him the office of Queen's fol∣licitor;
and in order to comfort his friend under the
disappointment, had conferred on him a present of
land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 78.</NOTE>. The
public could ill excuse Bacon's appearance before the
council, against so munificent a benefactor; tho' he
acted in obedience to the Queen's orders: But she was
so well pleased with his behaviour, that she imposed on
him a new task, of drawing a narrative of that day's
proceedings, in order to satisfy the nation of the
justice and lenity of her conduct. Bacon, who wanted
firmness of character, more than humanity, gave to
the whole transaction the most favourable turn for
Essex; and, in particular, painted out, in elaborate
expression, the dutiful submission which that nobleman
discovered in the defence which he made for his con∣duct.
When he read the paper to her, she smiled at
that passage, and observed to Bacon, that old love, she
saw, could not easily be forgotten. He replied, that
he hoped she meant that of herself<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 83.</NOTE>.</P>

ALL the world, indeed, expected that Essex would
soon be reinstated in his former credit<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 254.</NOTE>; perhaps,
as is usual in reconcilements founded on inclination;
would acquire an additional ascendant with the Queen,
and after all his disgraces, would again appear more a
favourite than ever. They were confirmed in this
hope, when they saw, that, tho' he was still prohibited
to appear at court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 462.</NOTE>, he was continued in his office
of master of horse, and was restored to his liberty, and
that all his friends had access to him. Essex himself
seemed determined to persevere in that conduct which
had hitherto been so successful, and which the Queen,
by all this discipline, had endeavoured to render habi∣tual
to him: He wrote to her, that he kissed her ma∣jesty's
hands, and the rod with which she had corrected
him; but that he could never recover his usual chear∣fulness,
till she deigned to admit him to that presence
which had ever been the chief source of his happiness
and enjoyment: And that he had now resolved to
make amends for his past errors, to retire into a country
solitude, and to say with Nebuchadnezzar, “Let
my dwelling be with the beasts of the field; let me
eat grass as an ox, and be wet with the dew of hea∣ven;
till it shall please the Queen to restore me to
my understanding.” The Queen was much pleased
with these sentiments, and replied, that she heartily
wished his actions might correspond to his expressions;
that he had tried her patience a long time, and it was
but just she should now make some experiment of his
submission; that her father would never have pardoned
so much obstinacy; but that, if the furnace of affliction
produced such good effects, she should ever after have
the better opinion of her chemistry<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="485"/>
THE earl of Essex possessed a monopoly of sweet
wines; and as his patent was near expiring, he pa∣tiently
expected that the Queen would renew it, and
considered this event as the critical circumstance of
his life, which would determine whether he could ever
hope to be reinstated in credit and authority<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Birch's memoirs, vol. II. p. 472.</NOTE>. But
Elizabeth, tho' gracious in her demeanor, was of a
temper somewhat haughty and severe; and being con∣tinually
surrounded with Essex's enemies, means were
found to persuade her, that his lofty spirit was not yet
sufficiently humbled, and that he must undergo this
farther trial, before he could again be safely received
into favour. She therefore refused his demand; and
even added, in a contemptuous stile, that an ungovern∣able
beast must be stinted in his provender<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His intrigues.</NOTE> pushed one step too far, proved the
final ruin of this young nobleman, and was the source
of infinite sorrow and vexation to the Queen herself.
Essex, who had with great difficulty so long subdued
his proud spirit, and whose patience was now exhausted,
imagining that the Queen was entirely inexorable,
burst at once all restraints of submission and of pru∣dence,
and was determined to seek relief, by proceeding
to the utmost extremitie against his enemies. Even
during his greatest favour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had ever been accustomed
to carry matters with a h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h hand against his sovereign;
and as this practice grat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed his own temper, and was
sometimes successful, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had imprudently imagined,
that it was the only proper method of managing her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 79.</NOTE>:
But being now reduced to despair, he gave entire reins
to his violent disposition, and threw off all appear∣ance
of duty and respect. Intoxicated with the ge∣neral
favour which he already possessed, he practised
anew every art of popularity; and endeavoured to
<PB N="435" REF="486"/>
increase the general good-will by a hospitable manner
of life, little suited to his situation and his circumstances.
His former employments had given him great connec∣tions
with gentlemen of the military profession; and
he now entertained, by additional caresses and civilities,
a friendship with all desperate adventurers, whose at∣tachment,
he hoped, might, in his present views, prove
serviceable to him. He secretly courted the confidence
of the catholics; but his chief trust lay in the puritans,
whom he openly caressed, and whose manners he
seemed to have entirely adopted. He engaged the
most celebrated prea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of that sect to resort to
Essex-house; he had da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> prayers and sermons in
his family; and he invited all the zealots in London
to attend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>those pious exercises. Such was the dispo∣sition
now beginning to prevail among the English,
that, instead of feasting and public spectacles, the me∣thods
anciently practised in commonwealths to gain
the populace, nothing so effectually ingratiated an am∣bitious
leader with the public, as these fanatical enter∣tainments.
And as the puritanical preachers frequently
inculcated in their sermons the doctrine of resistance
to the civil magistrate, they prepared the minds of
their hearers for those purposes which Essex was secretly
contriving<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 463. Camden, p. 630.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the greatest imprudence of this nobleman pro∣ceeded
from the openness of his temper, by which he was
ill qualified to succeed in such difficult and dangerous
projects. He indulged himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>great liberties of
speech, and was even heard to say of the Queen, that
she was now grown an old woman, and was become
as crooked in her mind as in her body<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 629. O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orne, p. 397. Sir Walter Raleigh's Prerogative of Parliament, p. 43.</NOTE>. Some court
ladies, whose favours Essex had formerly neglected,
carried her these stories, and incensed her to a high
<PB N="436" REF="487"/>
degree against him. Elizabeth was ever remarkably
jealous on this head; and tho' she was now approach∣ing
to her seventieth year, she allowed her courtiers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 442, 443.</NOTE>
and even foreign ambassadors<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 171.</NOTE>, to compliment her
upon her beauty; nor had all her good sense been able
to cure her of this preposterous infirmity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Most of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers seigned love and desire towards her, and addressed themselves to her in the stile of passion and gallantry. Sir Walter Raleigh, having fallen into disgrace, wrote the following letter to his friend Sir Robert Cecil, with a view, no doubt, of having it shewn to the Queen. “My heart was never broke till this day, that I hear the Queen goes away so far off, whom I have followed so many years, with so great love and desire, in so many journeys, and am now left behind her in a dark prison all alone. While she was yet near at hand, that I might hear of her once in two or three days, my sorrows were the less; but even now my heart is cast into the depth of all misery. I, that was wont to behold her riding like <HI>Alexander,</HI> hunting like <HI>Diana,</HI> walking like <HI>Venus,</HI> the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks, like a nymph, sometimes sitting in the shade like a Goddess, sometimes singing like an angel, sometimes playing like <HI>Orpheus;</HI> behold the sor∣row of this world! once amiss hath bereaved me of all. O glory that only shineth in misfortune, what is become of thy assurance? All wounds have scars but that of fantasie: All affections their relenting but that of womankind. Who is the judge of friendship but adversity, or when is grace witnessed but in offences? There were no divinity but by reason of compassion: For revenges are brutish and mortal. All those times past, the loves, the sighs, the sorrows, the desires, cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune? Cannot one drop of gall be hid in so great heaps of sweetness? I may then conclude, <HI>Spes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fortuna, valete.</HI> She is gone in whom I trusted; and of me hath not one thought of mercy, nor any respect of that which was. Do with me now there∣fore what you list. I am more weary of life than they are desirous I should perish; which, if it had been for her, as it is by her, I had been too happily born.” <HI>Murdin,</HI> 657. It is to be remarked, that this Nymph, Venu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gddess, Angel, was now about sixty. Yet five or six years after, she allowed the same language to be used to her. Sir Henry Unton, her ambassador in France, relates to her a conversation which he had with Henry the fourth. The Monarch, after having introduced Unton to his mistress, the fair Gabrielle, asked him how he liked her. “I an∣swered sparingly in her praise,” said the minister, “and told him, that if, without offence, I might speak it, I had the picture of a far more excellent mistress, and yet did her picture come far short of her per∣fection of beauty. As you love me, said he, shew it me, if you have it about you. I made some difficulties; yet upon his importunity offered it to his view very secretly, holding it still in my hand: He beheld it with passion and admiration, saying, that I had reason, <HI>Je me rends,</HI> protesting, that he had never seen the like: so, with great re∣verence, he kissed it twice or thrice, I detaining it still in my hand. In the end, with some kind of contention, he took it from me, vowing, that I might take my leave of it: For he would not forego it for any treasure: And that to possess the favour of the lively picture, he would forsake all the world, and hold himself most happy; with many other most passionate speeches.” <HI>Murdin,</HI> p. 718.

<P><PB N="437" REF="488"/>
THERE was another expedient employed by Essex,
which, if possible, was more provoking to the Queen
than those sarcasms on her age and deformity; and
that was, his secret applications to the King of Scots,
her heir and successor. That prince had this year
very narrowly escaped a dangerous, tho' ill formed,
conspiracy of the earl of Gowry; and even his deli∣very
was attended with this disagreeable circumstance,
that the obstinate ecclesiastics persisted, in spite of the
most incontestable evidence, to maintain to his face, that
there had been no such conspiracy. James, harrassed
with his turbulent and factious subjects, cast a wishful
eye to the succession of England; and in proportion
as the Queen advanced in years, his desire increased
of mounting that throne, on which, besides acquiring
a great addition of power and splendor, he hoped to go∣vern
a people, so much more tractable and submissive.
He negociated with all the courts of Europe, in order
to ensure himself friends and partizans: He even neg∣lected
not the court of Rome and that of Spain;
and tho' he engaged himself in no positive promise, he
flattered the catholics with hopes, that, in case of his
succession, they might expect some more liberty
<PB N="438" REF="489"/>
than what was at present indulged them. Elizabeth
was the only sovereign in Europe to whom he never
dared to mention his right of succession: He knew,
that tho' her great age might now invite her to think
of fixing an heir to the crown, she never could bear
the prospect of her own death without horror, and was
determined still to retain him, and all other competitors,
in an entire dependance upon her.</P>
<P>ESSEX was descended by females from the royal
family; and some of his sanguine partizans had been
so imprudent as to mention his name among those of
other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care,
by means of Henry Lee, whom he secretly sent into
Scotland, to assure James, that, so far from entertaining
such ambitious views, he was determined to use every
expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in
favour of that monarch's right of succession. James
willingly hearkened to this proposal; but did not ap∣prove
of the violent methods which Essex intended to
employ. Essex had communicated his scheme to
Mountjoy, lord deputy of Ireland; and as no man
ever commanded more the cordial affection and at∣tachment
of his friends, he had even engaged a person
of that virtue and prudence to entertain thoughts of
bringing over part of his army into England, and of
forcing the Queen to declare the King of Scots her
successor<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 471.</NOTE>. And such was Essex's impatient ardour,
that, tho' James declined this dangerous expedient,
he still endeavoured to persuade Moun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joy not to desist
from the project: But the deputy who thought that
such violence, tho' it might be prudent, and even
justifiable, when supported by a sovereign prince next
heir to the crown, would be rash and criminal, if at∣tempted
<PB N="439" REF="490"/>
by subjects, entirely refused his concurrence.
The correspondence, however, between Essex and the
court of Scotland was still conducted with great se∣crecy
and cordiality; and that nobleman, besides con∣ciliating
the favour of James, represented all his own
adversaries as enemies to that prince's succession, and
as men entirely devoted to the interests of Spain, and
partizans of the chimerical title of the Infanta.</P>
<P>THE Infanta and archduke, Albert, had made some
advances to the Queen for peace; and Boulogne, as
a neutral town, was chosen for the place of confer∣ence.
Sir Henry Nevil, the English resident in France,
Herbert, Edmondes, and Beale, were sent thither as
ambassadors from England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE> and negociated with Zu∣niga,
Carillo, Rachardot, and Verheiken, ministers
of Spain and the archduke: But the conserences were
soon broke off, on account of a dispute of ceremony.
Among the European states England had ever been
allowed the precedency above Castile, Arragon, Por∣tugal,
and the other kingdoms of which the Spanish
monarchy was composed; and Elizabeth insisted, that
this ancient right was not lost on account of the junc∣tion
of these states, and that Spain, in its present situa∣tion,
tho' it surpassed England in extent, as well as in
power, could not compare with it in point of antiquity,
the only durable and regular foundation of precedency
among kingdoms, as well as noble families. That she
might shew, however, a disposition to peace, she was
contented to yield to an equality; but the Spanish
ministers, as their country had always disputed prece∣dency
even with France, to which England yielded,
would proceed no farther in the conference, till their
superiority of rank was acknowledged.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Winwood's Memorials, vol. I. p. 186—226.</NOTE>. During the
<PB N="440" REF="491"/>
preparations for this abortive negociation, the earl of
Nottingham, the admiral lord Buckhurst, the trea∣surer,
and secretary Cecil, had discovered their incli∣nation
to peace; and as the English nation, flushed
with success, and sanguine in their hopes of plunder
and conquest, were in general averse to that measure,
it was easy for a person so popular as Essex, to infuse
into the multitude an opinion, that these ministers
had sacrificed the interests of their country to Spain,
and would even make no scruple of receiving a sovereign
from that hostile nation.</P>
<P>BUT Essex, not contented with these arts for de∣crying
his adversaries, proceeded to concert more vio∣lent
methods of ruining them; chiefly instigated by
Cuffe, his secretary, a man of a bold and arrogant
spirit, who had acquired a great ascendant over his
patron. A select council of malecontents was formed,
who commonly met at Drury-house, and were com∣posed
of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the house be∣longed,
the earl of Southampton, Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, Sir Christopher Blount, Sir John Davis, and
John Littleton; and Essex, who boasted, that he had
and hundred and twenty barons, knights, and gentle∣men
of note, at his devotion, and who trusted still
more to his authority with the populace, communi∣cated
to his associates those secret designs and resolu∣tions,
with which his confidence in so powerful a
party had inspired him. Among other criminal pro∣jects,
the result of blind rage and despir, he deliberat∣ed
with them concerning the method of taking arms;
and asked their opinion whether he had best begin
with seizing the palace or the Tower, or set out with
making himself master at once of both places. The
first enterprize being preferred, a method was con∣certed
for executing it. It was agreed, that Sir Christo∣pher
<PB N="441" REF="492"/>
Blount,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His insurrection.</NOTE> with a choice detachment, should possess
himself of the palace gates, that Davis should seize
the hall, Davers, the guard-chamber, and presence-chamber;
and that Essex should rush in from the
Meuse, attended by a body of his partizans; should
entreat the Queen, with all demonstrations of humility,
to remove his enemies; should oblige her to assemble
a Parliament, and should with common consent settle a
new plan of government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 630. Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 464. State Trials. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 542, 543.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE these desperate projects were in agitation,
many reasons of suspicion were carried to the Queen;
and she sent Robert Sacville, the treasurer's son, to
Essex-house on pretence of a visit, but, in reality,
with a view of discovering whether there was in that
place any concourse of people, or any extraordinary
preparations, which might threaten an insurrection.
Soon after, Essex received a summons to attend the
council, which met at the treasurer's house; and while
he was musing on this circumstance, and comparing
it with the late unexpected visit from Sacville, a private
note was conveyed to him, by which he was warned
to provide for his own safety. He concluded, that all
his conspiracy was discovered, or at least suspected, and
that the easiest punishment which he could expect, was
a new and more severe confinement: He therefore ex∣cused
himself to the council on pretence of an indispo∣sition;
and he immediately dispatched messages to his
more intimate confederates, requesting their advice and
assistance in the present critical situation of his affairs.
They deliberated, whether they should abandon all
their projects, and fly the kingdom; or instantly seize
the palace with the force which they could assemble;
or rely upon the affections of the citizens, who were
<PB N="442" REF="493"/>
generally known to bear a great affection to the earl.
Essex declared against the first expedient, and professed
himself determined to undergo any fate rather than
submit to live the life of a fugitive. To seize the
palace seemed impracticable without more preparation;
especially as the Queen seemed now aware of their
projects, and, as they heard, had used the precaution
of doubling her ordinary guards. There remained,
therefore, no other expedient but that of betaking
themselves to the city; and while the prudence and
expediency of this resolution was under debate, a per∣son
arrived, who, as if he had received a commission
for that purpose, gave them assurance of the affection of
the Londoners, and affirmed, that they might securely
rest any project on that foundation. The popularity
of Essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain un∣dertakings;
and he fondly imagined, that with no
other assistance than the good will of the multitude,
he might be enabled to overturn Elizabeth's goven∣ment,
confirmed by time, revered for wisdom, sup∣ported
by vigour, and concurring with the general
sentiments of the nation. The wild project of raising
the city was immediately resolved on; the execution
of it was delayed till next day; and emissaries were
dispatched to all Essex's friends, informing them that
Cobham and Raleigh had laid schemes against his life,
and entreating their presence and assistance.</P>
<P>NEXT day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> there appeared at Essex-house the earls
of Southampton and Rutland, the lords Sandys and
Monteagle, with about three hundred gentlemen of
good quality and fortune; and Essex informed them
of the danger, to which, he pretended, the machina∣tions
of his enemies exposed him. To some, he said,
that he would throw himself at the Queen's feet, and
crave her justice and protection: To others, he boasted
<PB N="443" REF="494"/>
of his interest in the city, and affirmed, that, what∣ever
might happen, this resource could never fail him.
The queen was informed of these designs, by means of
intelligence, conveyed, as is supposed, to Raleigh by
Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and having ordered the ma∣gistrates
of London to keep the citizens in readiness,
she sent Egerton, lord keeper, to Essex-house, with the
earl of Worcester, Sir William Knollys, controller,
and Popham, lord chief justice, in order to learn the
cause of these unusual commotions. They were with
difficulty admitted thro'a wicket; but all their servants
were excluded, except the purse-bearer. After some
altercation, in which they charged Essex's retainers,
upon their allegiance, to lay down their arms, and
were menaced in their turn by the angry multitude,
who surrounded them, the earl, who found, that mat∣ters
were past recal, resolved to leave them prisoners
in his house, and to proceed to the execution of his
former project. He issued out with about two hundred
attendants, armed only with swords; and in his passage
to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord
Cromwel. He cried aloud, <HI>For the Queen! for the
Queen! a plot is laid for my life;</HI> and then proceeded
to the house of Smith, the sheriff, on whose aid he
had great reliance. The citizens flocked about him
in amazement; but tho' he told them, that England
was sold to the infanta, and exhorted them to arm
instantly, otherwise they could not do him any service,
no one showed a disposition to join him. The sheriff,
on the earl's approach to his house, stole out at the
back door, and made the best of his way to the lord
mayor. Essex, meanwhile, observing the coldness of
the citizens, and hearing, that he was proclaimed a
traitor by the earl of Cumberland and lord Burleigh,
<PB N="444" REF="495"/>
began to despair of success, and thought of retreating
to his own house. He found the streets in his passage
barricadoed, and guarded by the citizens under the
command of Sir John Levison. In his attempt to
force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman, to whom
he bore great friendship, was killed with two or three
of the Londoners; and the earl himself, attended by
a few of his partizans (for the greatest part began se∣cretly
to withdraw themselves) retired towards the
river, and taking boat, arrived at Essex-house. He
there found, that Gorges, whom he had sent before
to capitulate with the lord keeper and the other coun∣sellors,
had given them all their liberty, and had gone
to court with them. He was now reduced to despair;
and appeared determined, in prosecution of lord San∣dys's
advice, to defend himself to the last extremity,
and rather to perish, like a brave man, with his sword
in his hand, than basely by the hands of the executi∣oner:
But after some parley, and after demanding in
vain, first hostages, then conditions, from the besiegers,
he surrendered at discretion; requesting only civil
treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 632.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, who, during all this commotion, had
behaved with as great tranquillity and security, as if
there had only passed a fray in the streets, in which
she was no way concerned<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 469.</NOTE>, soon gave orders for the
trial of the most considerable of the criminals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th February. His trial.</NOTE> The
earls of Essex and Southampton were arraigned before
a jury of twenty-five peers, where Buckhurst acted
as lord steward. The guilt of the prisoners was too
apparent to admit of any doubt; and, besides the in∣surrection
known to every body, the treasonable con∣ferences
<PB N="445" REF="496"/>
at Drury-house were proved by undoubted evi∣dence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1600.</NOTE> Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court:
The confessions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords
Cromwel, Sandys, and Monteagle, of Davers, Blount,
and Davies, were only read to the peers, according
to the practice of that age. Essex's best friends were
scandalized at his assurance in insisting so positively
on his innocence, and the goodness of his intentions;
and still more at his vindictive disposition, in accusing,
without any appearance of reason, secretary Cecil as
partizan of the infanta's title. The secretary who
had expected this charge, stepped into the court, and
challenged Essex to produce his authority, which, on
examination, was found extremely weak and frivolous<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 530.</NOTE>
When sentence was pronounced, Essex spoke like a
man who laid his account to die: But he added, that
he should be sorry, if he was represented to the Queen
as a person that despised her clemency; tho' he should
not, he believed, make any cringing submissions to
obtain it. Southampton's behaviour was more mild
and submissive: He entreated the good offices of the
peers in so modeft and becoming a manner, as excited
compassion in every one.</P>
<P>THE most remarkable circumstance in Essex's trial
was Bacon's appearance against him. He was none
of the crown lawyers; so was not obliged by his
office to assist at this trial: Yet did he not scruple, in
order to obtain the Queen's favour, to be active in
bereaving of life his friend and patron, whose generosity
he had often experienced. He compared Essex's con∣duct,
in pretending to fear the attempts of his adver∣saries,
to that of Pisistratus, the Athenian, who cut
and wounded his own body; and making the people

believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1601.</NOTE> that his enemies had committed that violence,
obtained a guard for his person, by whose assistance he
afterwards subdued the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>AFTER Essex had passed some days in the solitude
and reflexion of a prison, his proud heart was at last
subdued, not by the fear of death, but by the senti∣ments
of religion; a principle, which he had before
attempted to make the instrument of his ambition, but
which now took a more firm hold of his mind, and
prevailed over every other motive and consideration.
His spiritual directors persuaded him, that he never
could obtain the pardon of heaven, unless he made a
full confession of his disloyalty; and he gave in to
the council an account of all his most criminal designs,
as well as of his correspondence with the King of Scots.
He spared not even his most intimate friends, such as
lord Mountjoy, whom he had engaged in these con∣spiracies;
and he sought to pacify his present remorse,
by making such attonements as in any other period
of his life, he would have deemed more blameable than
those attempts themselves, which were the objects of
his penitence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol, I. p. 300.</NOTE>. Sir Harry Nevil, in particular, a man
of merit, he accused of a correspondence with the con∣spirators;
tho' it appears, that that gentleman had
never assented to the proposals made him, and was no
farther criminal than in not revealing the earl's treason;
an office to which every man of honour naturally bears
the strongest reluctance<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 302.</NOTE>. Nevil was thrown into
prison, and underwent a severe persecution: But as
the Queen found Mountjoy a very able and successful
commander, she continued him in his government, and
sacrificed her resentment to the public service.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="500"/>
ELIZABETH affected extremely the praise of cle∣mency;
and in every great example, which she had
made during her reign, she had always appeared full
of reluctance and hesitation: But the present situa∣tion
of Essex called forth all her tender affections,
and kept her in the most real agitation and irresolution.
She felt a perpetual combat between resentment and
inclination, pride and compassion, the care of her own
safety and concern for her favourite; and her situation,
during this interval, was perhaps more an object of
pity, than that to which Essex himself was reduced.
She signed the warrant for his execution; she counter-manded
it; she again resolved on his death; she felt
a new return of tenderness. Essex's enemies told her,
that he himself desired to die, and had assured her,
that she could never be in safety while he lived: It
is likely, that this proof of penitence and of concern
for her, would operate a contrary effect to what they
intended, and would revive all that fond affection,
which she had so long indulged to the unhappy pri∣soner.
But what chiefly hardened her heart against him
was his supposed obstinacy, in never making, as she
hourly expected, any application to her for mercy
and forgiveness; and she finally gave her consent to
his execution. He discovered at his death symptoms
rather of penitence and piety than of fear; and wil∣lingly
acknowledged the justice of the sentence, by
which he suffered. The execution was private in the
Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Febru∣ary.</NOTE> agreeable to his own request. He was ap∣prehensive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execution.</NOTE>
he said, left the favour and compassion of
the people would too much raise his heart in those
moments when humiliation under the afflicting hand
of heaven was the only proper sentiment, which he
<PB N="448" REF="501"/>
could indulge<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dr. Barlow's sermon on Essex's execution. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 534.</NOTE>. And the Queen, no doubt, thought,
that prudence required the removal of so melancholy
a spectacle from the public eye. Sir Walter Raleigh,
who came to the Tower on purpose, and who beheld
Essex's execution from a window, encreased much
by this action the general hatred, under which he
already laboured: It was thought, that he had no
other purpose than to feast his eyes with the death of
his enemy; and no apology, which he could make
for so exceptionable a conduct, could be accepted by
the public. The cruelty and animosity, with which
he urged on Essex's fate, even when Cecil relented<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Murdin, p. 811.</NOTE>,
were still regarded as the principles of this unmanly
and ungenerous behaviour.</P>
<P>THE earl of Essex was but thirty-four years of age,
when his rashness, imprudence, and violence brought
him to this untimely end. We must here, as in
many other instances, lament the inconstancy of
human nature, that a person endowed with so many
noble virtues, generosity, sincerity, friendship, valour,
eloquence, and industry, should in the latter period
of his life have given such reins to his ungovernable
passions, as involved, not only himself, but many of
his friends, in utter ruin. The Queen's tenderness
and passion for him, as it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause of those pre∣mature
honours, which he attained, seems, on the
whole, the chief circumstance which brought on his
destruction. Confident of her partiality towards him,
as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a
haughtiness, which neither her love nor her dignity
could bear; and as her amorous inclinations in so ad∣vanced
an age, would naturally make her appear ri∣diculous,
<PB N="449" REF="502"/>
if not hateful in his eyes, he was engaged,
by an imprudent openness, of which he made pro∣fession,
to discover too easily those sentiments to her.
The many reconciliations and returns of affection,
of which he had still made advantage, induced him to
venture on new provocations, till he pushed her be∣yond
all bounds of patience; and he forgot, that, tho'
the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her,
those of the sovereign had still in the end appeared
predominant.</P>
<P>SOME of Essex's associates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount,
Meric, and Davis were tried and condemned, and
all of them, except Davis, were executed. The
Queen pardoned the rest; being persuaded that they
were drawn in merely from their friendship to that
nobleman, and their care of his safety; and were
ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions.
Southampton's life was spared with great difficulty;
but he was detained in prison during all the remainder
of this reign.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, who was apprehensive lest
his correspondence with Essex might have been disco∣vered,
and have given offence to Elizabeth, sent the
earl of Marre and the lord Kinloss as ambassadors to
England, in order to congratulate the Queen on her
escape from the late insurrection and conspiracy. They
were also ordered to enquire whether any measures
had been taken by her to exclude him from the suc∣cession,
as well as to discover the inclinations of the
chief nobility and counsellors, in case of the Queen's
demise<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 510.</NOTE>. They found the dispositions of men as fa∣vourable
as they could wish; and they even entered
into a correspondence with secretary Cecil, whose in∣fluence,
after the fall of Essex, was now uncontrouled<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Osborne, p. 615.</NOTE>,
<PB N="450" REF="503"/>
and who was resolved, by this policy, to acquire, in
time, the confidence of the successor. He knew how
jealous Elizabeth ever was of her authority, and he
therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment
to James: But he afterwards asserted, that nothing
could be more advantageous to her, than this corres∣pondence;
because the King of Scots, secure of
mounting the throne by his undoubted title, aided by
those connexions with the English ministry, was the
less likely to give any disturbance to the present so∣vereign.
He also persuaded that prince to remain in
quiet, and patiently to expect, that time should open
to him the inheritance of the throne, without pushing
his friends on desperate enterprizes which would totally
incapacitate them from serving him. James's equity,
as well as his natural facility of disposition, easily in∣clined
him to embrace this resolution<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 471, 472.</NOTE>; and thus the
minds of the English were silently, but universally
disposed to admit, without opposition the succession
of the Scottish line: The death of Essex, by putting
an end to faction, had been rather favourable than pre∣judicial
to that great event.</P>
<P>THE King of France, who was little prepossessed
in favour of James, and who was averse to the union
of England and Scotland<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 352.</NOTE>, made his ambassador drop
some hints to Cecil of Henry's willingness to concu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in any measure for disappointing the hopes of the
Scottish monarch; but as Cecil showed an entire dis∣approbation
of such schemes; the court of France
took no farther steps in that matter; and thus the only
foreign power, which could give much disturbance to
James's succession,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> was induced to acquiesce in it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spotswoo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 47<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>▪
Henry made a journey this summer to Calais; and the
Queen, hearing of his intentions, went to Dover
<PB N="451" REF="504"/>
in hopes of having a personal interview with a mon∣arch,
whom, of all others, she most loved and most
respected. The French King, who felt the same senti∣ments
towards her, would gladly have accepted of the
proposal; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared
necessary to lay aside, by common consent, the pro∣ject
of an inte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>view. Elizabeth, however, wrote suc∣cessively
two letters to Henry, one by Edmondes,
another by Sir Robert Sydney, in which she expressed
a desire of conferring about a business of importance,
with some minister in whom that prince reposed entire
confidence. The marquess of Rhoni, the King's fa∣vouite
and prime minister, came to Dover in disguise;
and the memoirs of that able statesman contain a
full account of his conversation with Elizabeth. That
magnanimous princess had formed a scheme of esta∣blishing,
in conjunction with Henry, a new system
of policy in Europe, and of fixing a durable ballance
of power, by the erection of new states on the ruins
of the house of Austria. She had even the wisdom to
foresee the perils, which might ensue from the ag∣grandizement
of her ally; and she proposed to unite
all the seventeen provinces of the Low Countries into
one republic, in order to form a perpetual barrier
against the dangerous encrease of the French, as well
as of the Spanish, monarchy. Henry had himself
long meditated such a project against the Austrian fa∣mily;
and Rhoni could not forbear expressing his
astonishment, when he found that Elizabeth and his
master, tho' they had never communicated their
thoughts on this subject, had not only entered into
the same general views, but had also formed the same
project for their execution. The affairs, however,
of France were not yet brought to a situation, which
might enable Henry to begin that great enterprize;
and Rhoni satisfied the Queen, that it would be ne∣cessary

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

to postpone for some years their united attack
on the house of Austria. He departed, filled with
just admiration of the solid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Elizabeth's judgment,
and the greatness of her mind; and he owns that she
was entirely worthy of that high reputation, which
she possessed in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Queen's magnanimity in forming such exten∣sive
projects was the more remarkable, as, besides her
having fallen so far into the decline of life, the affairs
of Ireland, tho' conducted with ability and success,
were still in disorder, and made a great diversion of
her forces. The expence incurred by this war lay
heavy upon her narrow revenues; and her ministers,
taking advantage of her great disposition to frugality,
proposed to her an expedient of saving, which, tho'
she at first disapproved of it, she was at last induced
to embrace. It was represented to her, that the great
sums of money remitted to Ireland for the pay of the
English forces, came, by the necessary course of cir∣culation,
into the hands of the rebels, and enabled
them to buy abroad all necessary supplies of arms and
ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty of that
kingdom and its want of every useful commodity, they
could not otherwise find means to purchase. It was
therefore proposed to her, that she should pay her
forces in money of a base alloy; and it was asserted,
that, besides the great saving to the revenue, this species
of coin could never be exported with advantage, and
would not pass in any foreign market. Some of the
wiser counsellors maintained, that, if the pay of the
soldiers was raised in proportion, the Irish rebels would
necessarily reap the same benefit from the base money,
which would always be taken at a rate suitable to its
value; if the pay was not raised, there was danger
of a mutiny among the troops, who, whatever names
might be aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xed to the pieces of metal, would soon
find from experience that they were defrauded in their
<PB N="453" REF="508"/>
income<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 643.</NOTE>. But Elizabeth, tho' she justly valued her∣self,
on fixing the standard of the English coin, much
debased by her predecessors, and had innovated very
little in that delicate article, was seduced by the spe∣cious
arguments employed by the lord treasurer on
this occasion; and she coined a great quantity of base
money, which she made use of in the pay of her forces
in Ireland<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MOUNTJOY, the deputy, was a man of great ability;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountjoy's success in Ireland.</NOTE>
and foreseeing the danger of mutiny among the troops,
he led them instantly into the field, and resolved, by
means of strict discipline, and by keeping them em∣ployed
against the enemy, to obviate those inconve∣niencies,
which were justly apprehended. He made
military roads, and built a fortress at Moghery; he
drove the Mac-Genises out of Lecale; he harrassed
Tyrone in Ulster with inroads and lesser expeditions;
and by destroying, every where, and during all seasons,
the provisions of the Irish, he reduced them to perish
with famine in the woods and morasses, to which
they were obliged to retreat. At the same time, Sir
Henry Docwray, who commanded another body of
troops, took the castle of Derry, and put garrisons
into Newton and Ainogh; and having seized the mo∣nastery
of Donnegal near Balishannon, he threw troops
into it, and defended it against the assaults of O'Don∣nel
and the Irish. Nor was Sir George Carew idle in
the province of Munster. He seized the titular earl of
Desmond, and sent him over, with Florence Macarty,
another chieftain, prisoner to England. He arrested
many suspected persons, and took hostages from others.
And having got a reinforcement of two thousand men
from England, he threw himself into Corke, which
he supplied with arms and provisions; and he put

every thing in a condition for resisting the Spanish
invasion, which was daily expected. The deputy,
informed of the danger, to which the southern pro∣vinces
were exposed, left the prosecution of the war
against Tyrone, who was reduced to great extre∣mity;
and he marched with his army into Mun∣ster.</P>
<P>At
last, the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Septem∣ber.</NOTE> under Don John d'Aquila,
arrived at Kingsale; and Sir Richard Piercy, who com∣manded
in the town with a small garrison of an hun∣dred
and fifty men, found himself obliged to abandon
it on their appearance. These invaders amounted to
four thousand men, and the Irish expressed a great
desire to join them, in order to free themselves from the
English government, with which they were extreme∣ly
discontented. One chief ground of their com∣plaint
was the introduction of their trials by jury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 644.</NOTE>;
an institution, abhorred by this barbarous nation,
tho' nothing contributes more to the support of that
equity and liberty, for which the English laws are so
justly celebrated. The Irish also bore a great favour
to the Spaniards, having entertained the opinion that
they themselves were descended from that nation; and
their attachment to the catholic religion proved a
new cause of affection to the invaders. D'Aquila
assumed the title of general <HI>in the holy war for the preser∣vation
of the faith</HI> in Ireland, and he endeavoured to
persuade the people, that Queen Elizabeth was, by
several bulls of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe, deprived of her crown;
that her subjects were absolved from their oaths of alle∣giance;
and that the Spaniards were come to deliver
the Irish from the power of the devil<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 645.</NOTE>. Mountjoy
found it necessary to act with vigour, in order to pre∣vent
a total insurrection of the Irish; and having ga∣thered
<PB N="455" REF="512"/>
together his forces, he formed the siege of
Kinsale by land; while Sir Richard Levison, with a
small squadron, blockaded it by sea. He had no sooner
begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of an∣other
body of two thousand Spaniards under the com∣mand
of Alphonso Ocampo, who had taken possession of
Baltimore and Berehaven; and he found himself obliged
to detach Sir George Carew to oppose their progress.
Tyrone, meanwhile, with Randal, Mac-Surley, Tirel
baron of Kelley, and other chieftains of the Irish, had
joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were march∣ing
to the relief of Kinsale. The deputy, informed of
their design by intercepted letters, made preparations
to receive them; and being joined by Levison with
six hundred marines, he posted his troops on an ad∣vantageous
ground, which lay on their passage, leav∣ing
some cavalry to prevent a sally from D'Aquila and
the Spanish garrison. When Tyrone, with a body of
Irish and Spaniards, approached, he was surprized to
find the English so well posted, and ranged in such good
order; and he immediately sounded a retreat: But the
deputy gave orders to pursue him; and having thrown
these advanced troops into disorder, he followed them
to the main body, whom he also attacked, and put to
flight, with the slaughter of twelve hundred men<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 359.</NOTE>.
Ocampo was taken prisoner; Tyrone fled, into Ul∣ster;
Odonel made his escape into Spain; and D'Aquila,
finding himself reduced to the greatest difficulties,
was obliged to capitulate upon such terms as the de∣puty
prescribed to him: He surrendered Kinsale and
Baltimore, and agreed to evacuate the kingdom. This
great blow, joined to other successes, gained by Wilmot,
governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin Harvey,
threw the rebels into dismay, and gave a prospect of
the final reduction of that Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="513"/>
THE Irish war, tho' successful, was extremely bur∣thensome
on the Queen's reyenue; and besides the sup∣plies
granted by Parliament, which were indeed very
small, but which they ever regarded as mighty con∣cessions,
she had been obliged, notwithstanding her
great frugality, to employ other expedients, such as
felling the royal demesnes and crown jewels<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 629.</NOTE>, and
exacting loans from the people<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, in order to support
this cause, so essential to the honour and interests of
England. The necessity of her affairs obliged her
again to summon a Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 October. A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and it here appeared,
that, tho' old age was advancing fast upon her, tho'
she had lost much of her popularity by the unfortunate
execution of Essex, insomuch that, when she appeared
in public, she was not attended with the usual accla∣mations<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 602. Osborne, p. 60<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, yet the powers of her prerogative, support∣ed
by her vigour, still remained as high and uncon∣troulable
as ever.</P>
<P>THE active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many per∣sons
to distinguish themselves in civil and military em∣polyments;
and the Queen, who was not able, from
her revenue, to give them any rewards proportioned to
their services, had made use of an expedient, which had
been employed by her predecessors, but which had
never been carried to such an extreme as under her ad∣ministration.
She granted her servants and courtiers
patents for monopolies; and these patents they sold
to others, who were thereby enabled to raise commo∣dities
so what price they pleased, and who put invinci∣ble
restraints upon all commerce, industry, and emu∣lation.
It is astonishing to consider the number and
importance of those commodities, which were thus as∣signed
over to patentees. Currants, salt, iron, powder,
<PB N="457" REF="514"/>
cards, calf-skins, fells, pouldavies, ox-shin-bones,
train oil, lists of cloth, pot-ashes, anniseeds, vinegar,
sea-coals, steel, aquavita, brushes, pots, bottles, salt-petre,
lead, accidences, oil, calamint-stone, oil of
blubber, glasses, paper, starch, tin, sulphur, new dra∣pery,
dried pilchards, transportation of iron ordnance,
of beer, of horn, of leather, importation of Spanish
wools, of irish yarn: These are but a part of the com∣modities,
which had been consigned over to monopo∣lists<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 648, 650, 652.</NOTE>. When this list was read over in the house, a
member cried out, <HI>Is not bread in the number? Bread,</HI>
said every one with astonishment: <HI>Yes, I assure you,</HI>
replied he, <HI>if affairs go on at this rate, we shall have bread
reduced to a monopoly before next Parliament</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 648.</NOTE>. These
monopolists were so exorbitant in their demands, that
in some places they raised the price of salt, from six∣teen
pence a bushel, to fourteen or fifteen shillings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 647.</NOTE>.
Such high profits naturally begot intruders upon their
commerce; and in order to secure themselves against
encroachments, the patentees were armed with high
and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they
were enabled to oppress the people at pleasure, and
to exact money from such as they thought proper to
accuse of interfering with their patent<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 644, 646, 652.</NOTE>. The paten∣tees
of salt-petre, having the power of entering into
every house, and of committing what havock they
pleased in stables, cellars, or where-ever they suspected
salt-petre might be gathered; commonly extorted
money from those who desired to free themselves from
this damage or trouble<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 653.</NOTE>. And while all domestic in∣tercourse
was thus restrained, lest any scope should
remain for industry, almost every species of foreign
commerce was confined to exclusive companies, who
<PB N="458" REF="515"/>
bought and sold at any price, that they themselves
thought proper to offer or exact.</P>
<P>THESE grievances, the most intolerable for the
present, and the most pernicious in their consequences,
that ever were known in any age or under any go∣vernment,
had been mentioned in the last Parliament,
and a petition had even been presented to the Queen,
complaining of the patents; but she still persisted in
defending her monopolists against her people. A bill
was now introduced into the lower house, abolishing
all these monopolies; and as the former application
had been unsuccessful, a law was insisted on as the
only certain expedient for correcting these abuses:
The courtiers, on the other hand, maintained, that
this matter regarded the prerogative, and that the com∣mons
could never hope for success, if they did not
make application, in the most humble and respectful
manner, to the Queen's goodness and beneficence.
The topics, which were advanced in the house, and
which came equally from the courtiers and the country
gentlemen, and were admitted by both, will appear
the most extraordinary to such as are prepossessed with
an idea of the privileges enjoyed by the people during
this age, and of the liberty possessed under the ad∣ministration
of Elizabeth. It was asserted, that the
Queen inherited both an enlarging and a restraining
power; by her prerogative she might set at liberty
what was restrained by statute or otherwise, and by
her prerogative she might restrain what was otherwise
at liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 644. 675.</NOTE>: That the royal prerogative was not to
be canvassed nor disputed nor examined<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 644, 649.</NOTE>; and did not
even admit of any limitation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 646, 654.</NOTE>. That absolute princes,
such as the sovereigns of England, were a species of
divinity<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 649.</NOTE>. That it was in vain to attempt tying the
<PB N="459" REF="516"/>
Queen's hands by laws or statutes; since, by means
of her dispensing power, she could loosen herself at her
pleasure<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: That even if a clause should be annexed
to a statute, excluding her dispensing power; she could
first dispense with that clause, and then with the sta∣tute<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 640, 646.</NOTE>.
After all this discourse, more worthy of a
Turkish divan than of an English house of commons,
according to our present idea of this assembly, the
Queen, who perceived how odious monopolies had
become, and what heats were likely to rise, sent for
the speaker, and desired him to inform the house, that
she would immediately cancel the most grievous and
oppressive of these patents<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be amiss to subjoin some passages of these speeches; which may serve very much to give us a just idea of the government of that age and of the political principles, which prevailed during the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Laurence Hyde proposed a bill, entituled, an act for the explanation of the common law in certain cases of letters patent. Mr. Spicer said, This bill may touch the prerogative-royal, which, as I learned the last Parlia∣ment, is so transcendant, that the—of the subject may not aspire there∣unto. Far be it therefore from me, that the state and prerogative-royal of the prince should be tied by me, or by the act of any other subject. Mr. Francis Bacon said, As to the prerogative royal of the Prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it is such as I hope will never be discussed. The Queen, as she is our sovereign, hath both an enlarging and restr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining power. For by her prerogative she may set at liberty things restrained by statute law or otherwise, and secondly by her prerogative she may restrain things which be at liberty. For the first, she may grant a <HI>non obstante</HI> contrary to the penal laws.—With regard to monopolies and such like cases, the case hath ever been to humble ourselves unto her Majesty, and by petition desire to have our grievances remedied, especially when the remedy toucheth her so nigh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. point of prerogative—I say, and I say it again, that we ought not to deal, to judge, or meddle with her majesty's prerogative. I wish therefore every man to be careful of this business. Dr. Bennet said, He that goeth about to debate her majesty's prerogative had need to walk warily. Mr. Laurence Hyde said, For the bill itself, I made it, and I think I understand it: And far be it from this heart of mine to think, this tongue to speak, or this hand to write any thing either in prejudice or derogation of her majesty's prerogative-royal and the state.—Mr. Speaker, quoth serjeant Harris, for ought I see, the house moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition. It must then begin with more humiliation. And truly, Sir, the bill is good of itself, but the penning of it is somewhat out of course. Mr. Montague said, The matter is good and honest, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well enough in this matter. The grievances are great, and I would note only unto you thus much, that the last Parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which had no successful effect. Mr. Francis More said, I know the Queen's prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are not comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great grievances that the town and country, for which I serve, suffereth by some of these monopolies. It bringeth the ge∣neral profit in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a private hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the subjects. We have a law for the true and faithful currying of leather: There is a patent sets all at liberty, notwithstanding that statute. And to what purpose is it to do any thing by act of Parliament, when the Queen will undo the same by her prerogative? Out of the spirit of humiliation, Mr. Speaker, I do speak it, there is no act of her's that hath been or is more derogatory to her own majesty, more odious to the subject, more dangerous to the commonwealth than the granting of these monopolies. Mr. Martin said, I do speak for a town that grieves and pines, for a country that groaneth and languisheth under the burthen of monstrous and unconscionable substitutes to the monopolitans of starch, tin, fish, cloth, oil, vinegar, salt, and I know not what; nay, what not? The principalest commodities both of my town and country are engrost into the hands of these blood suckers of the commonwealth. If a body, Mr. Speaker, being let blood, be left still languishing without any remedy, how can the good estate of that body still remain? Such is the state of my town and country; the traffic is taken away, the inward and private commo∣dities are taken away, and dare not: be used without the licence of these monopolitans. If these blood-suckers be still let alone to suck up the best and principalest commodities, which the earth there hath given us, what will become of us, from whom the fruits of our own soil and the com∣modities of our own labour, which with the sweat of our brows, even up to the knees in mite and dirt, we have laboured for, shall be taken by warrant of supreme authority, which the poor subject dare not gainsay? Mr. George Moore said, We know the power of her majesty cannot be restrained by any act; why therefore should we thus talk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Admit we should make this statute with a: <HI>non obstate;</HI> yet the Queen may grant a patent with a <HI>non obstante,</HI> to cross this <HI>non obstante.</HI> I think therefore it agreeth more with the gravity and wisdom of this house to proceed with all humbleness by petition than hill. Mr. Downland said, As I would be no let or over vehement in any thing, so I am not fottish or senseless of the common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of pe∣tition, we can have no more gracious answer, than we had the last Parlia∣ment to our petition. But since that Parliament, we have no reformation. Sir Robert Wroth said, I speak, and I speak it boldly, these patentees are worse than ever they were. Mr. Hayward Townsend proposed, that they should make suit to her majesty, not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the subject, but also that it would please her majesty to give the Par∣liament leave to make an act, that they might be of no more force, validity, or effect, than they are at the common law, without the strength of her prerogative. Which tho' we might now do, and the act being so reason∣able, we might assure ourselves her majesty would not delay the passing thereof, yet we, her loving subjects, &amp;c. would not offer without her privity and consent (the cause so nearly touching her prerogative) or go about to do any such act.</P>
<P>On a subsequent day, the bill against monopolies was again introduced, and Mr. Spicer said, it is to no purpose to offer to tie her majesty's hands by act of parliament, when she may loosen herself at her pleasure. Mr. Davies said, God hath given that power to absolute princes, which he at∣tributes to himself. <HI>Dixi quod Dii est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> (N. B. This axiom he applies to the Kings of England.) Mr. secretary Cecil said, I am servant to the Queen, and before I would speak and give consent to a case that should debase her prerogative, or abridge it, I would wish that my tongue were cut out of my head. I am sure there were law-makers before there were laws: (Meaning, I suppose, that the sovereign was above the laws.) One gentleman went about to possess us, with the execution of the law in an ancient record of 5 or 7 of Edward the third. Likely enough to be true in that time, when the King was afraid of the subject. If you stand upon law, and dispute of the prerogative, hark ye what Bracton says, <HI>Praerogativam nostram <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> disputare.</HI> And for my own part, I like not these courses should be taken. And you, Mr. Speaker, should perform the charge her majesty gave unto you, in the beginning of this Parliament, not to receive bills of this nature: For her majesty's ears be open to all grievances, and her hands stretched out to every man's petitions.—When the prince dispenses with a penal law, that is left to the alteration of sovereignty, that is good and irrevocable. Mr. Montague said, I am loth to speak what I know, lest▪ perhaps, I should displease. The prerogative royal is that which is now in question, and which the laws of the land have ever allowed and main∣tained. Let us therefore apply by petition to her majesty.</P>
<P>After the speaker told the house that the Queen had annulled many of the patents, Mr. Francis Moore said, I must confess, Mr. Speaker, I moved the house both the last Parliament and this, touching this point; but I never meant (and I hope the house thinketh so) to set limits and bounds to the prerogative royal. He proceeds to move, that thanks should be given to her majesty; and also, that whereas divers speeches have been moved extra∣vagantly in the house, which doubtless have been told her majesty, and per∣haps ill conceived of by her, Mr. Speaker would apologize, and humbly crave pardon for the same. N. B. These extracts were taken by Townsend, a member of the house, who was no courtier; and the extravagance of the speeches seems rather to be on the other side: It will certainly appear odd to us, that this liberty should be thought extravagant. However, the Queen, notwithstanding her cajoling the house, was so ill satisfied with these proceedings, that she spoke of them peevishly in her concluding speech, and told them, that she perceived, that private respects with them were privately masqued under public presence. D'Ewes, p. 619.</P>
<P>There were some other topics, in favour of prerogative, still more extra∣vagant, advanced in the house this parliament. When the question of the subsidy was before them, Mr. serjeant Heyle said, Mr. Speaker, I marvel much, that the house should stand upon granting of a subsidy or the time of payment, when all we have is her majesty's and she may lawfully at her pleasure take it from us: Yea, she hath as much right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown. At which all the house hemmed, and laughed, and talked. Well, quoth serjeant Heyle, all your hemming shall not put me out of countenance. So Mr. Speaker stood up and said, It is a great disorder, that this should be used.—So the said serjeant pro∣ceeded, and when he had spoken a little while, the house hemmed again; and so he sat down. In his latter speech, he said, he could prove his former position by precedents in the time of Henry the third, King John, King Stephen, &amp;c. which was the occasion of their hemming. D'Ewes, p. 633. It is observable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer, a man of character. Winwood, vol. I. p. 290. And tho' the house in general shewed their disapprobation, no one cared to take him down, or oppose these extravagant positions. It was also asserted this session, that in the same manner as the Roman consul was possessed of the power of rejecting or admitting motions in the senate, the Speaker might either admit or reject bills in the house. D'Ewes, p. 677. The house declared themselves against this opinion; but the very proposal of it is a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England.</P>
<P>In the year 1591, the judges made a solemn decree, that England was an absolute empire, of which the King was the head. In consequence of this opinion, they determined, that even if the act of the first of Elizabeth had never been made, the King was supreme head of the church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, such a court as the ecclesiastical com∣mission: For that he was the head of all his subjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary: The inference is, that his power was equally absolute over the laity. See Coke's Reports, p. 5. Caudrey's case.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="517"/>
THE house was struck with astonishment, and ad∣miration,
and gratitude at this extraordinary instance
<PB N="461" REF="518"/>
of the Queen's goodness and condescension. A mem∣ber
said, with tears in his eyes, that if a sentence of
<PB N="462" REF="519"/>
everlasting happiness had been pronounced in his fa∣vour,
he could have felt more joy than that with which
he was at present overwhelmed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 654.</NOTE>. Another observed,
<PB N="463" REF="520"/>
that this message from the sacred person of the Queen,
was a kind of gospel or glad-tidings, and ought to be
received as such, and be written in the tablets of their
hearts<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 656.</NOTE>. And it was farther remarked, that in the
same manner as the Deity would not give his glory to
another, so the Queen herself was the only agent in
their present prosperity and happiness<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 657.</NOTE>. The house
voted, that the speaker, with a certain number of mem∣bers,
should ask permission to wait on her majesty, and
return her thanks for her gracious concessions to her
people.</P>
<P>WHEN the speaker, with the other members, was in∣troduced
to the Queen, they all flung themselves on
their knees; and remained in that posture a consider∣able
time, till she thought proper to express her desire,
that they should rise. The speaker displayed the gra∣titude
of the commons, on account that her sacred ears
were ever open to hear them, and her blessed hands
ever stretched out to relieve them. They acknowleged,
he said, in all duty and thankfulness acknowleged,
that, before they called, her <HI>preventing grace,</HI> and
<HI>all-deserving goodness</HI> watched over them for their good;
more ready to give than they could desire, much less
deserve. He remarked, that the attribute which was
most proper to God, to perform all he promiseth, ap∣pertained
also to her; and that she was all truth, all
constancy, and all goodness. And he concluded with
these expressions, “Neither do we present our thanks
in words or any outward sign, which can be no
sufficient retribution for so great goodness; but in
all duty and thankfulness, prostrate at your feet, we
present our most loyal and thankful hearts, even the
last drop of blood in our hearts, and the last spirit
of breath in our nostrils, to be poured out, to be
<PB N="464" REF="521"/>
breathed up, for your safety<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 658, 659.</NOTE>.” The Queen heard
very patiently this speech, where she was flattered in
phrases appropriated to the Supreme Being; and she
returned an answer, full of such expressions of ten∣derness
towards her people, as ought to have appeared
fulsome after the late instances of rigour which she had
employed, and from which nothing but necessity had
made her depart. Thus was this critical affair happily
terminated; and Elizabeth, by prudently receding,
in time, from her rights, maintained her dignity, and
preserved the affections of her people.</P>
<P>THE commons granted her a supply very unprece∣dented,
of four subsidies and eight fifteenths; and they
were so dutiful as to vote this supply before they re∣ceived
any satisfaction in the business of monopolies,
which they justly considered as of the utmost conse∣quence
to the interest and happiness of the nation.
Had they attempted to extort that concession by keep∣ing
the supply in suspence; so haughty was the Queen's
disposition, that this appearance of constraint and jea∣lousy
had been sufficient to have produced a denial of
all their requests, and to have forced her into some acts
of authority still more violent and arbitrary.</P>
<P>THE remaining events of this reign are neither very
numerous nor important.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1602.</NOTE> The Queen, finding that
the Spaniards had involved her in so much trouble, by
fomenting and assisting the Irish rebellion, resolved
to give them employment at home; and she fitted out
a squadron, of nine ships under Sir Richard Levison,
admiral, and Sir William Monson, vice-admiral, whom
she sent on an expedition to the coast of Spain. The
admiral, with part of the squadron, met the galleons
loaded with treasure; but was not strong enough to
attack them: The vice-admiral also fell in with some
<PB N="465" REF="522"/>
very rich ships; but they escaped for a like reason:
And these two brave officers, that their expedition
might not be entirely fruitless, resolved to attack the
harbour of Cerimbra in Portugal, where, they received
intelligence, a very rich Carrack had taken shelter.
The harbour was guarded by a castle: There were
eleven gallies stationed in it: And the militia of the
country, to the number, as was believed, of twenty
thousand men, appeared in arms on the shore: Yet,
notwithstanding these obstacles, and others derived
from the winds and tides, the English squadron broke
into the harbour, dismounted the guns of the castle,
sunk or burnt, or put to flight, the gallies, and obliged
the carrack to surrender<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 181.</NOTE>. They brought her home to
England, and she was valued at a million of ducats<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 647.</NOTE>▪
A sensible loss to the Spaniards; and a supply still more
considerable to Elizabeth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">This year the Spaniards begun the siege of Ostead, which was bravely defended for five months by Sir Francis Vere. The States then relieved him, by sending a new governor; and on the whole the siege lasted three years, and is computed to have cost the lives of an hundred thousand men.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Ireland, after the defeat of Tyrone,
and the expulsion of the Spaniards, hastened to a set∣tlement.
Lord Mountjoy divided his army into small
parties, and harrassed the rebels on every side: He
built Charlemount, and many other small sorts, which
were impregnable to the Irish, and guarded all the
important passes of the country: The activity of Sir
Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chichester, permitted
no repose or security to the rebels: And many of the
chieftains, after skulking, during some time, like wild
beasts, in woods and morasses, submitted to mercy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1603.</NOTE>
and received such conditions as the deputy was pleased
to impose upon them. Tyrone himself made applica∣tion
<PB N="466" REF="523"/>
by Arthur Mac-Baron, his brother, to be received
upon terms; but Mountjoy would not admit him,
except he made an absolute surrender of his life and
fortune to the Queen's mercy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrone's submission.</NOTE> He appeared before
the deputy at Millesont, in a habit and posture suitable
to his present fortune; and after acknowleging his
offence in the most humble terms, he was committed
to custody by Mountjoy, who intended to bring him
over captive into England, to be disposed of at the
Queen's pleasure.</P>
<P>BUT Elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any
satisfaction from this fortunate event:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's sickness.</NOTE> She had fallen
into a profound melancholy; which all the advantages
of her high fortune, all the glories of her prosperous
reign, were unable, in any degree, to alleviate or
assuage. Some ascribed this depression of mind to her
repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone, whom she
had always resolved to bring to condign punishment
for his treasons, but who had made such interest with
the ministers, as to extort a remission from her.
Others, with more likelihood, accounted for her de∣jection,
by a discovery which she had made, of the
correspondence maintained in her court with her suc∣cessor
the King of Scots, and by the neglect to which,
on account of her old age and infirmities, she imagined
herself to be exposed. But there is another cause
assigned for her melancholy, which has long been
rejected by historians as romantic, but which late dis∣coveries
seem to have confirmed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See the proofs of this remarkable fact collected in Birch's Negocia∣tions, p. 206. And Memoirs, vol. II. p. 481, 505, 506, &amp;c.</NOTE>: Some incidents
happened which revived her tenderness for Essex, and
filled her with the deepest sorrow for the consent which
she had unwarily given to his execution.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="524"/>
THE earl of Essex, after his return from the for∣tunate
expedition against Cadiz, observing the increase
of the Queen's fond attachment towards him, took
occasion to regret, that the necessity of her service re∣quired
him often to be absent from her person, and
exposed him to all those ill offices which his enemies,
more assiduous in their attendance, could employ against
him. She was moved with this tender jealousy; and
making him the present of a ring, desired him to keep
that pledge of her affection, and assured him, that into
whatever disgrace he should fall, whatever prejudices
she might be induced to entertain against him, yet, if
he sent her that ring, she would immediately upon the
sight of it, recollect her former tenderness, would afford
him again a hearing, and would lend a favourable ear
to his apology. Essex, notwithstanding all his misfor∣tunes,
reserved this precious gift to the last extremity;
but after his trial and condemnation, he resolved to try
the experiment, and he committed the ring to the
countess of Nottingham, whom he desired to deliver
it to the Queen. The countess was prevailed on by
her husband, who was Essex's capital enemy, not to
execute the commission; and Elizabeth, who still ex∣pected
that her favourite would make this last appeal
to her tenderness, and who ascribed the neglect of it
to his invincible obstinacy, was, after much delay, and
many internal combats, pushed by resentment and
policy to sign the warrant for his execution. The
countess of Nottingham, falling into sickness, and
finding herself approach towards her end, was seized
with remorse for her conduct; and having obtained a
visit from the Queen, she craved her pardon, and re∣vealed
to her the fatal secret. The Queen, astonished
with this incident, burst into a furious passion: She
shook the dying countess in her bed; and crying to her,
<PB N="468" REF="525"/>
<HI>That God might pardon her, but she never could,</HI> she broke
from her, and thenceforth resigned herself over to the
deepest and most incurable melancholy. She rejected
all consolation: She even refused food and sustenance:
And throwing herself on the floor, she kept herself
silent and immoveable, feeding her thoughts on her
afflictions, and declaring life and existence an insuffer∣able
burthen to her. Few words she uttered; and
they were all expressive of some inward grief which
she cared not to reveal: But sighs and groans were the
chief vent which she gave to her despondency, and
which, tho' the discovered her sorrows, were never
able to ease or assuage them. Ten days and nights
she lay upon the carpet, leaning on cushions which her
maids brought her; and her physicians could not per∣suade
her to allow herself to be put to bed, much less
to make trial of any remedies which they prescribed to
her<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. No. 276.</NOTE>. Her anxious mind at last had so long preyed
on her frail body, that her end was visibly approach∣ing;
and the council, being assembled, sent the lord
keeper, the lord admiral, and the secretary, to know
her mind with regard to her successor. She answered
with a faint voice, that as she had held a regal scepter,
she desired no other than a royal successor. Cecil re∣questing
her to explain herself more particularly, she
subjoined, that she would have a King to succeed her;
and who should that be but her nearest kinsman, the
King of Scots. Being then advised by the archbishop
of Canterbury, to fix her thoughts upon God, she
replied, that she did so, nor did her mind in the least
wander from him. Her voice soon after left her, her
senses failed, she fell into a lethargic slumber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death</NOTE>, which
continued some hours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE> and she expired gently, without
<PB N="469" REF="526"/>
farther struggle or convulsion, in the seventieth year
of her age, and forty-fifth of her reign.</P>
<P>SUCH a dark cloud overcast the evening of that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And charac∣ter.</NOTE>
which had shone out with a mighty lustre in the eyes
of all Europe. There are few great personages in
history who have been more exposed to the calumny
of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen
Elizabeth, and yet there scarce is any, whose reputation
has been more certainly determined, by the unanimous
consent of posterity. The unusual length of her ad∣ministration,
and the strong features of her character,
were able to overcome all prejudices; and obliging
her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and
her admirers somewhat of their penegyrics, have at last,
in spite of political factions, and what is more, of
religious animosities, produced an uniform judgment
with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her constancy,
her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, address,
are allowed to merit the highest praises, and appear not
to have been surpassed by any person who ever filled a
throne: A conduct less rigorous, less imperious, more
sincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been
requisite to form a perfect character. By the force of
her mind, she controuled all her more active and stronger
qualities, and prevented them from running into excess:
Her heroism was exempt from all temerity, her fru∣gality
from avarice, her friendship from partiality,
her active temper from turbulency and a vain ambition:
She guarded not herself with equal care or equal success
from lesser infirmities; the rivalship of beauty, the
desire of admiration, the jealousy of love, and the sallies
of anger.</P>
<P>Her singular talents for government were founded
equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed
with a great command over herself, she soon obtained
<PB N="470" REF="527"/>
an uncontrouled ascendant over her people; and while
she merited all their esteem by her real virtues, she
also engaged their affection by her pretended ones.
Few sovereigns of England succeeded to the throne
in more difficult circumstances; and none ever con∣ducted
the government with such uniform success and
felicity. Tho' unacquainted with the practice of to∣leration,
the true secret for managing religious factions,
she preserved her people, by her superior prudence,
from those confusions in which theological controversy
had involved all the neighbouring nations: And tho'
her enemies were the most powerful princes of Europe,
the most active, the most enterprizing, the least scru∣pulous,
she was able by her vigour to make deep im∣pressions
on their state: Her own greatness mean while
remained untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>THE wise ministers, and brave warriors, who flou∣rished
during her reign, share the praise of her success;
but instead of lessening the applause due to her, they
make great addition to it. They owed, all of them,
their advancement to her choice; they were supported
by her constancy; and with all their ability, they were
never able to acquire any undue ascendant over her.
In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, she re∣mained
equally mistress: The force of the tender
passions was great over her, but the force of her mind
was still superior; and the combat which her victory
visibly cost her, serves only to display the firmness of
her resolution, and the loftiness of her ambitious sen∣timents.</P>
<P>THE
fame of this princess, tho' it has surmounted the
prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies still
exposed to another prejudice, which is more durable
because more natural, and which, according to the
different views in which we survey her, is capable
<PB N="471" REF="528"/>
either of exalting beyond measure, or diminishing the
lustre of her character. This prejudice is founded on
the consideration of her sex. When we contemplate
her as a woman, we are apt to be struck with the
highest admiration of her great qualities and extensive
capacity; but we are also apt to require some more
softness of disposition, some greater lenity of temper,
some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is
distinguished. But the true method of estimating her
merit, is to lay aside all these considerations, and con∣sider
her merely as a rational being, placed in autho∣rity,
and entrusted with the government of mankind.
We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her
as a wife or a mistress; but her qualities as a sovereign,
tho' with some considerable exceptions, are the object
of undisputed applause and approbation.</P>
<P>THE party amongst us who have distinguished them∣selves
by their adherence to liberty and a popular Go∣vernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government, manners, commerce, arts and learning.</NOTE>
have long indulged their prejudices against
the succeeding race of princes, by bestowing unbounded
panegyrics on the virtue and wisdom of Elizabeth.
They have been so extremely ignorant of transactions
of this reign, as to extol her for a quality which, of
all others, she was the least possest of; a tender regard
for the constitution, and a concern for the liberties and
privileges of her people. But as it is scarce possible for
the prepossessions of party to throw a veil much longer
over facts so palpable and undeniable, there is danger
lest the public should run into the opposite extreme,
and should entertain an aversion to the memory of a
princess who exercised the royal authority in a manner
so contrary to all the ideas which we at present enter∣tain
<PB N="472" REF="529"/>
of a legal constitution. But Elizabeth only sup∣ported
the prerogatives which were transmitted to her
by her immediate predecessors: She believed that her
subjects were entitled to no more liberty than their
ancestors enjoyed: She found that they entirely acqui∣esced
in her arbitrary administration: And it was not
natural for her to find fault with a form of government,
by which she herself was invested with such unlimited
authority. In the particular exertions of power, the
question ought never to be forgot, <HI>What is best?</HI> But
in the general distribution of power among the several
members of a constitution, there can seldom be ad∣mitted
any other question, than <HI>What is usual?</HI> Few
examples occur of princes, who have willingly resigned
their power: None of those who have, without strug∣gle,
allowed it to be extorted from them. If any other
rule than established practice be followed, factions and
dissensions must multiply without end: And tho' many
constitutions, and none more than the British, have
been improved even by violent innovations, the praise
which we bestow on those patriots, to whom we are
indebted for our privileges, ought to be given with some
reserve, and surely without the least rancour against
those who adhered to the ancient constitution.</P>
<P>IN order to understand the ancient constitution of
England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">By the ancient constitution, is here meant that which prevailed before the settlement of our present plan of liberty. There was a more antient constitution, where, tho' the people had perhaps less liberty than under the Tudors, yet the King had also less authority: The power of the barons was a great check upon him, and exercised great tyra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny over them. But there was still a more antient constitution, viz. that before the signing of the charter, where neither the people nor the barons had any regular autho∣rity; and the power of the government was almost wholly in the King. The English constitution, like all others, has been in a state of continual fluctuation.</NOTE>, there is not a period which deserves more
to be studied than the reign of Elizabeth. The pre∣rogatives
<PB N="473" REF="530"/>
of this princess were scarce ever disputed,
and she therefore employed them without scruple:
Her imperious temper, a circumstance in which she
went far beyond her successors, rendered her exertions
of power violent and frequent, and discovered the
full extent of her authority: The great popularity
which she enjoyed, proves, that she did not infringe
any established liberties of the people: There remain
monuments numerous enough to ascertain the most
noted acts of her administration: And tho' these mo∣numents
must be sought for remote from the ordinary
historians, they become only the more authentic on
that account, and serve as a stronger proof, that the
particular exertions of her power were conceived to
be nothing but the ordinary course of administration,
since they were not thought remarkable enough to be
recorded even by contemporary writers. If there was
any difference in this particular, the people, in former
reigns, seem rather to have been more submissive than
during the age of Elizabeth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In a memorial of the state of the realm, drawn by secretary Cecil, in 1569, there is this passage. “Then followeth the decay of obedience in civil policy, which being compared with the fearfulness and reverence of all inferior estates to their superiors in times past, will astonish any wise and considerate person, to behold the desperation of reformation.” Haynes, p. 586. Again, p. 588.</NOTE>. It may not here be
improper to recount some of the ancient prerogatives
of the crown, and lay open the sources of that great
power which the English monarchs formerly en∣joyed.</P>
<P>ONE
of the most ancient and most established in∣struments
of power was the court of Star-chamber,
which possessed an unlimited discretionary authority of
fining, imprisoning, and inflicting corporal punishment,
and whose jurisdiction extended to all sorts of offences,
contempts, and disorders, that lay not within reach
<PB N="474" REF="531"/>
of the common law. The members of this court con∣sisted
of the privy council and the judges; men, who
all of them enjoyed their offices during pleasure: And
when the prince himself was present, he was the sole
judge, and all the others could only interpose with their
advice. There needed but this one court in any govern∣ment,
to put an end to all regular, legal, and exact
plans of liberty. For who durst set himself in oppo∣sition
to the crown and ministry, or aspire to the
character of being a patron of freedom, while exposed
to so arbitrary a jurisdiction? I much question, whe∣ther
any of the absolute monarchies in Europe con∣tain,
at present, so illegal and despotic a tribunal.</P>
<P>THE court of High Commission was another juris∣diction
still more terrible, both because the crime of
heresy, of which it took cognizance, was more unde∣finable
than any civil offence, and because its methods
of inquisition and of administering oaths, were more
contrary to all the most simple ideas of justice and
equity. The fines and imprisonments imposed by this
courts were frequent: The deprivations and suspen∣sions
of the clergy for non-conformity, were also very
numerous, and comprehended at one time the third
of all the ecclesiastics of England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Neal, vol. I. p. 479</NOTE>. The Queen, in
a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, said express∣ly,
that she was resolved, “That no man should be
suffered to decline either on the lest or on the right
hand, from the drawn line limited by authority, and
by her laws and injunctions<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 183.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>BUT Martial Law went far beyond even these two
courts in a prompt and arbitrary and violent method of
decision. Whenever there was any insurrection or
public disorder, the crown employed martial law; and
<PB N="475" REF="532"/>
it was, during that time, exercised not only over the
soldiers, but over the whole people: Any one might
be punished as a rebel, or an aider and abettor of re∣bellion,
whom the provost-marshal or lieutenant of
counties, or their deputies, pleased to suspect. Lord
Bacon says, that the trial at common law granted to the
earl of Essex, and his fellow conspirators, was a fa∣vour:
For that the case would have born and required
the severity of martial law<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vol. IV. p. 510.</NOTE>. We have seen instances
of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of
orthodoxy. There remains a letter of Queen Eliza∣beth's
to the earl of Sussex, after the suppression of the
northern rebellion, in which she reproves him sharply,
because she had not heard of his having done any exe∣cution
by martial law<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Royston's from the Paper Office.</NOTE>; tho' it is probable, that near
eight hundred persons suffered, one way or other, on
account of that slight insurrection. But the Kings of
England did not always limit the exercise of this law
to the times of war and rebellion. In 1552, when
there was no rebellion or insurrection, King Edward
granted a commission of martial law; and empowered
the commissioners to execute it, <HI>as should be thought by
their discretions most necessary</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Memoirs, vol. II. p. 373, 458, 9.</NOTE>. Queen Elizabeth too
was not sparing in the use of this law. In 1573, one
Peter Burchet a puritan, being persuaded that it was
lawful or meritorious to kill such as opposed the truth
of the gospel, ran into the streets, and wounded Haw∣kins,
the famous sea-captain, whom he took for Hatton,
the Queen's favourite. The Queen was so incensed
that she ordered him to be punished instantly by martial
law; but upon the remonstrance of some prudent coun∣sellors,
who told her, that that law ought to be confined
<PB N="476" REF="533"/>
to turbulent times, she recalled her order, and delivered
over Burchet to the common law<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 446. Strype, vol. II. p. 288.</NOTE>. But she continued
not always so reserved in exerting this authority. There
remains a proclamation of hers, in which she orders
martial law to be used against all such as import bulls,
or even forbidden books and pamphlets from abroad<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 570.</NOTE>;
and prohibits the lieutenants or their deputies to be
questioned for their arbitrary punishment of such of∣fenders,
<HI>any law or statute to the contrary in any wise not∣withstanding.</HI>
We have another act of hers still more
extraordinary. The streets of London were very much
infested with idle vagabonds and riotous persons: The
lord mayor had endeavoured to repress this disorder:
The Star-chamber had exerted its authority, and in∣flicted
punishment on these riotors: But the Queen,
finding those remedies ineffectual, revived martial law,
and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commission of provost-marshal:
“Granting him authority, and commanding
him, upon signification given by the justices of peace
in London or the neighbouring counties, of such of∣fenders,
worthy to be speedily executed by martial
law, to attach and take the same persons, and in the
presence of the said justices, according to justice of
martial law, to execute them upon the gallows or
gibbet openly, or near to such place where the said
rebellious and incorrigible offenders shall be found
to have committed the said great offences<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 279.</NOTE>.” I sup∣pose
it will be difficult to produce an instance of such
an act of authority in any place nearer than Mus∣covy.</P>
<P>THE
Star chamber, and High Commission, and
Court Martial, tho' arbitrary jurisdictions, yet had still
some pretence of a trial, at least a sentence; but there
<PB N="477" REF="534"/>
was a grievous punishment very familiarly inflicted in
that age, without any other authority than the warrant
of a secretary of state, or of the privy-council<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1588, the lord mayor committed several citizens to prison, because they refused to pay the loan demanded of them. Murden, p. 632.</NOTE>; and
that was, imprisonment, in any jail, and during any
time that these ministers should think proper. In sus∣picious
times, all the jails were full of prisoners of state;
and these unhappy victims of public jealousy were some∣times
thrown into dungeons, and loaded with irons,
and treated in the most cruel manner, without their
being able to obtain any remedy from law.</P>
<P>THIS practice was an indirect way of employing tor∣ture:
But the rack itself was frequently used, upon any
suspicion, without other authority than a warrant from
the secretary or the privy council. Even the council
in the marches of Wales were empowered, by their
very commission, to make use of torture, whenever they
thought proper<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 196.</NOTE>. There cannot be a stronger proof
how lightly the rack was employed, than the following
story, told by lord Bacon. We shall give it in his
own words. “The Queen was mightily incensed
against Haywarde, on account of a book he dedicated
to lord Essex, being a story of the first year of
King Henry the fourth, thinking it a seditious pre∣lude
to put into the people's heads boldness and fac∣tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">To our apprehension, Haywarde's Book seems rather to have a contrary tendency. For he has there preserved the famous Speech of the Bishop of Carlisle, which contains, in the most ex∣press terms, the Doctrine of passive obedience. But Queen Elizabeth was very difficult to please on this head.</NOTE>: She said, she had an opinion that there was
treason in it, and asked me, if I could not find any
places in it, that might be drawn within the case
of treason: Whereto I answered, For reason, sure
I found none; but for felony, very many: And
when her majesty hastily asked me, Wherein? I told
<PB N="478" REF="535"/>
her, the author had committed very apparent theft:
For he had taken most of the sentence of Cornelius
Tacitus, and translated them into English, and
put them into his text. And another time, when
the Queen could not be persuaded, that it was
his writing whose name was to it, but that it had
some more mischievous author, and said with great
indignation, that she would have him racked to pro∣duce
his author; I replied, Nay, madam, he is a
doctor, never rack his person, but rack his stile:
Let him have pen, ink, and paper, and help of books,
and be enjoined to continue the story where it break∣eth
off, and I will undertake, by collating the styles,
to judge whether he were the author of no<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>.”
Thus, had it not been for Bacon's humanity, or ra∣ther
his wit, this author, a man of letters, had been
put to the rack, for a most innocent performance. His
real offence was, his dedicating a book to that muni∣sicent
patron of the learned, the earl of Essex, at a
time when this nobleman lay under disgrace with her
majesty.</P>
<P>THE Queen's menace of trying and punishing Hay∣warde
for treason, could easily have been executed,
let his book have been ever so innocent. While so
many terrors hung over the people, no jury durst have
acquitte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man whom the court was resolved to have
condemned. The practice also of not confronting the
witnesses with the prisoner, gave the crown lawyers
all imaginable advantages against him. And, indeed,
there scarce occurs an instance, during all these reigns,
that the sovereign, or the ministers, were ever disap∣pointed
in the issue of a prosecution. Timid juries,
and judges who held their offices during pleasure, never
failed to second all the views of the court.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="536"/>
THE power of pressing, and obliging any person to
accept of any office, was another prerogative totally
incompatible with freedom. Osborne gives the follow∣ing
account of Elizabeth's method of employing this
prerogative. “In case she found any likely to inter∣rupt
her occasions,” says he, “she did seasonably
prevent him by a chargeable employment abroad,
or putting him upon some service at home, which
she knew least grateful to the people: Contrary to
a false maxim, since practised with far worse success,
by such princes as thought it better husbandry to
buy off enemies man reward friends<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Page 392.</NOTE>.” The prac∣tice
with which Osborne reproaches the two immediate
successors of Elizabeth, proceeded partly from the ex∣treme
difficulty of their situation, partly from the
greater lenity of their disposition. The power of pres∣sing,
as may naturally be imagined, was often abused;
and money was exacted by the officers for freeing per∣sons
from the service<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE government of England during that age,
however different in other particulars, bore, in this re∣spect,
some resemblance to that of Turkey at present:
The sovereign possessed every power, except that of
imposing taxes: And in both countries this limitation,
unsupported by other privileges, appears rather pre∣judicial
to the people. In Turkey, it obliges the Sul∣tan
to permit the extortion of the bashas and governors
of provinces, from whom he afterwards squeezes pre∣sents
or takes forfeitures: In England, it engaged the
Queen to erect monopolies, and grant patents for ex∣clusive
trade: An invention so pernicious, that, had
she gone on, during a tract of years, at her own rate,
England, the seat of riches, and arts, and commerce,

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="480" REF="539"/>
would have contained at present as little industry as
Morocco, or the coast of Barbary.</P>
<P>WE may further observe, that this valuable privi∣lege,
valuable only because it proved afterwards the
means by which the Parliament extorted all their other
privileges, was very much encroached on, in an in∣direct
manner, during the reign of Elizabeth, as well
as of her predecessors. She often exacted loans from
her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of imposition
and which individuals felt severely: For tho' the money
had been regularly restored, which was seldom the
case<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol IV. p. 362.</NOTE>, it lay in the prince's hands without interest,
which was a sensible loss to the individuals from whom
the money was borrowed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the second of Richard II, it was enacted that in loans, which the King shall require of his subjects, upon letters of Privy Seal, such as have <HI>reasonable</HI> excuse of not lending, may there be received without further summons, travel or greef. See Cotton's Abridg. p. 170. By the law, the King's Prerogative of exacting loans was ratify'd; and what ought to be deem'd a <HI>reasonable</HI> excuse was still left in his own breast, to judge of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE remains a proposal made by the lord Bur∣leigh,
for levying a general loan on the people, equi∣valent
to a subsidy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 518, 519.</NOTE>; a scheme which would have laid
the burthen more equally, but which was, in different
words, nothing but a taxation, imposed without con∣sent
of Parliament. It is remarkable, that the scheme,
thus proposed, without any visible necessity, by that
wise minister, is the very same which Henry the eighth
attempted, and which Charles the first, enraged by
ill usage from his Parliament, and reduced to the great∣est
difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the great
discontent of the nation.</P>
<P>THE demand of benevolence was another invention
of that age for taxing the people. This practice was
so little conceived to be irregular, that the commons,
in 1585, offered the Queen a benevolence; which she
very generously refused, as having no occasion, at that
<PB N="481" REF="540"/>
time, for money<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 494.</NOTE>. Queen Mary also, by an order <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
council, increased the customs in some branches; and
her sister imitated the example<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>. There was a species
of ship money imposed at the time of the Spanish in∣vasion.
The several ports were required to equip a
certain number of ships at their own charge; and such
was the alacrity of the people for the public defence,
that some of the ports, particularly London, sent double
the number demanded of them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 267.</NOTE>. When any levies
were made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries,
the Queen obliged the counties to raise the soldiers,
to arm and cloth them, and carry them to the sea∣ports
at their own charge. New Year's gifts were,
at that time expected from the nobility, and from the
more considerable gentry<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. I. p. 137</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PURVEYANCE was another method of taxation, un∣equal,
arbitrary and oppressive. The whole kingdom
felt sensibly the burthen of this imposition; and it was
regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on
Oxford and Cambridge, to prohibit the purveyors from
taking any commodities within five miles of these uni∣niversities.
The Queen victualled her navy by means
of this prerogative, during the first years of her go∣vernment<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WARDSHIP was the most regular and legal of all these
impositions by prerogative. Yet was it a great badge
of slavery, and oppressive to the great families. When
an estate sell to a female, the sovereign obliged her to
marry any one he pleased: Whether the heir was male
or female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the
rents during the minority. The giving a rich wardship
was an usual method of rewarding a courtier or fa∣vourite.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="541"/>
THE inventions were endless, which arbitrary power
might employ for extorting of money, while the peo∣ple
imagined that their property was secured by the
crown's being debarred from imposing taxes. Strype
has preserved a speech of lord Burleigh to the Queen
and council, wherein are contained some particulars
not a little extraordinary<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 234, &amp; seq.</NOTE>. Burleigh proposes that
she should erect a court for the correction of all abuses,
and should confer on the commissioners a general in∣quisitorial
power over the whole kingdom. He sets
before her eyes the example of her wise grandfather,
Henry the seventh, who, by such methods, augmented
extremely his revenue; and he recommends, that this
new court should proceed, “as well by the direction
and ordinary course of the laws, as by virtue of her
majesty's supreme regiment and <HI>absolute power, from
whence law proceeded.</HI>” In a word, he expects from
this institution, greater accession to the royal treasure,
than Henry the eighth derived from abolition of the
abbeys, and all the forfeitures of the ecclesiastical re∣venues.
This project of lord Burleigh needs not, I
think, any comment. A form of government must be
very arbitrary, where a wise and good minister could
make such a proposal to the sovereign.</P>
<P>EMBARGOES on merchandize was another engine of
royal power, by which the English princes were able
to extort money from the people. We have seen
instances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her
coronation, issued an order to the custom-house, pro∣hibiting
the sale of all crimson silks which should be
imported, till the court was first provided<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 27.</NOTE>. She ex∣pected,
no doubt, a good penny-worth from the mer∣chants,
while they lay under this restraint.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="542"/>
THE Parliament pretended to the right of enacting
laws, as well as of granting subsidies; but this pri∣vilege
was, during that age, still more insignificant
than the other. Queen Elizabeth expressly prohibited
them from meddling with state matters or ecclesiastical
causes; and she openly sent the members to prison,
who dared to transgress her imperial edict in these par∣ticulars.
There passed few Parliaments, during her
reign, where there occur not instances of this arbitrary
conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the legislative power of the Parliament was a
mere fallacy, while the sovereign was universally ac∣knowleged
to possess a dispensing power, by which all
the laws could be invalidated, and rendered of no
effect. The use of this power was also an indirect
method practised for erecting monopolies. Where the
statutes laid any branch of manufacture under restric∣tions,
the sovereign, by exempting one person from
the laws, gave him in effect the monopoly of that
commodity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, torn. XV. p. 756. D'Ewes, p. 645</NOTE>. There was no grievance, at that time,
more universally complained of, than the frequent dis∣pensing
with the penal laws<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 325.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT in reality, the crown possessed the full legisla∣tive
power, by means of proclamations, which might
affect any subject of the greatest importance, and which
the Star-chamber took care to see more rigorously exe∣cuted
than the laws themselves. The motives of these
proclamations were sometimes vey frivolous and even
ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had taken offence at the
smell of woad; and she issued an edict prohibiting any
one to cultivate that useful plant<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Townsend's Journals, p. 250. Stow's Annals.</NOTE>. She was also
pleased to take offence at the long swords and high ruffs
then in fashion: She sent about her officers, to break
<PB N="484" REF="543"/>
every man's sword, and clip every man's ruff, which
was beyond a certain length<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Townsend's Journals, p. 250. Stow's Annals. Strype, vol. II. p. 603.</NOTE>. This practice re∣sembles
somewhat the method employed by the great
Czar Peter, to make his subjects change their garb.</P>
<P>THE Queen's prohibition of the prophesyings was
founded on a better reason; but shews still the unli∣mited
extent of her prerogative. Two or three people
could not meet together, in order to read the scriptures,
and confer about religion, tho' in ever so orthodox a
manner, without her permission.</P>
<P>THERE were many other branches of prerogative
incompatible with an exact or regular enjoyment of
liberty. None of the nobility could marry without
permission from the sovereign. The Queen detained
the earl of Southampton long in prison, because he
privately married the earl of Essex's cousin<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 422.</NOTE>. No
man could travel without the consent of the prince.
Sir William Evers underwent a severe persecution, be∣cause
he had presumed to pay a private visit to the King
of Scots<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament in the thirteenth of the Queen
praised her for not imitating the practice, usual among
her predecessors, of stopping the course of justice by
particular warrants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>. There could not possibly be a
greater abuse, nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power;
and the Queen, in refraining from it, was very lauda∣ble.
But she was by no means constant in this reserve.
There remain in the public records some warrants of
her's for exempting persons from all law-suits and pro∣secutions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 652, 708, 777.</NOTE>; and these warrants, she says, she grants
from her royal prerogative, which she will not allow
to be disputed.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="544"/>
IT was very usual in Queen Elizabeth's reign,
and probably in all the preceding reigns, for noblemen
or privy counsellors to commit to prison any one,
who had happened to displease them by suing for his
just debts; and the person, tho' he gained his cause
in the courts of justice, was commonly obliged to re∣linquish
his property in order to obtain his liberty.
Some likewise, who had been delivered from prison
by the judges, have again been committed to custody
in secret places without any possibility of obtaining
relief; and even the officers and serjeants of the
courts of law have been punished for executing the
writs in favour of these persons. Nay, it was usual
to send for people by pursuivants, a kind of harpies,
who then attended the orders of the council and high
commission; and they were brought up to London,
and constrained by imprisonment, not only to with∣draw
their lawful suits, but also to pay the pursuivants
great sums of money. The judges, in the 34th of
the Queen, complain to her majesty of the frequency
of this practice. It is probable, that that tyranny was
carried no further down than the reign of Elizabeth;
since the Parliament, who obtained the petition of
right, found no later instances of it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, Vol. I. p. 511. Franklyn's Annals, p, 250, 251.</NOTE>. And even
these very judges of Elizabeth, who thus protect the
people against the tyranny of the great, expressly
allow, that a person committed by special command
from the Queen, is not baileable.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine, that, in such a government,
no justice could, by course of law, be obtained of the
sovereign, unless he was willing to allow it. In the
naval expedition, undertaken by Raleigh and Forbisher
against the Spaniards, in 1592, a very rich carrack
was taken worth two hundred thousand pounds. The
<PB N="486" REF="545"/>
Queen's share in the adventure was only a tenth part;
but as the prize was so great, and exceeded so much
the expectations of all the adventurers, she was deter∣mined
not to rest contented with her share. Raleigh,
humbly and earnestly begged her to accept of an hun∣dred
thousand pounds, in lieu of all demands, or ra∣ther
exactions; and says, that the present, which the
proprietors were willing to make her of eighty thou∣sand
pounds, was the greatest that ever a prince re∣ceived
from a subject<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 128, 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it is no wonder the Queen, in her administra∣tion,
should pay so little regard to liberty; while the
parliament itself, in enacting laws, were so entirely
negligent of it. The persecuting statutes, which they
passed against papists and puritans, are extremely con∣trary
to the genius of freedom; and by exposing such
multitudes to the tyranny of priests and bigots, accu∣stomed
the people to the most disgraceful subjection.
Their conferring an unlimited supremacy on the Queen,
or what is worse, acknowleging her inherent right to
it, was another proof of their voluntary servitude.</P>
<P>THE law of the 23d of her reign, making seditious
words against the Queen capital, is also a very tyran∣nical
statute; and an use, no less tyrannical, was some∣times
made of it. The case of Udal, a puritanical
clergymany seems singular, even in those arbitrary
times. This man had published a book called a de∣monstration
of discipline, in which he inveighed against
the government of bishops; and tho' he had carefully
endeavoured to conceal his name, he was thrown into
prison upon suspicion, and brought to his trial for this
offence. It was pretended, that the bishops were part
of the Queen's political body; and to speak against
<PB N="487" REF="546"/>
them, was really to attack her, and was therefore
felony by the statute. This was not the only iniquity,
to which Udal was exposed. The judges would not
allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact,
whether Udal had wrote the book, or not, without
examining his intention, or the import of the words.
In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not
produce a single witness to the court: They only read
the testimony of two persons absent, one of whom said
that Udal had told him he was the author; another,
that a friend of Udal's had said so. They would not
allow Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence;
which, they said, was never to be permitted against the
Queen. And they tendered him an oath, by which
he was required to swear, that he was not author of
the book; and his refusal to give that testimony was
employed as the strongest proof of his guilt. It is
almost needless to add, that, notwithstanding these
multiplied iniquities, a verdict of death was given by the
jury against Udal: For as the Queen was extremely
bent upon his prosecution, it was impossible he could
escape<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 144. Strype, vol. IV. p. 21. Id. Life of Whitgift, p. 343.</NOTE>. He died in prison before the execution of the
sentence.</P>
<P>THE case of Penry was, if possible, still harder.
This man was a zealous puritan, or rather, a Brownist;
and he had wrote against the hierarchy several tracts,
such as Martin Mar-prelate, <HI>Theses Martinianae,</HI> and
other compositions full of low scurrility and petulant
satyre. After concealing himself for some years, he
was seized; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the statute against seditious words
required that the criminal should be tried within a
year after committing the offence, he could not be in∣dicted
for his printed books. He was therefore tried
<PB N="488" REF="547"/>
for some papers found in his pocket, as if he had thereby
scattered sedition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, book IV. chap. II. Neal, vol. I. p. 564.</NOTE>. It was also imputed to him, by
the lord keeper, Puckering, that in some of these papers,
“he had only acknowleged her majesty's royal power
to <HI>establish</HI> laws, ecclesiastical and civil; but had
avoided the <HI>usual</HI> terms of <HI>making, enacting, decreeing,
and ordaining</HI> laws: Which imply,” says the lord
keeper, “a most absolute authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 177.</NOTE>.” Penry for
these offences was condemned and executed.</P>
<P>THUS we have seen, that <HI>the most absolute</HI> authority
of the sovereign, to make use of the lord keeper's phrase,
was established on above twenty branches of preroga∣tive,
which are now abolished, and which were, every
one of them, totally incompatible with the liberty of
the subject. But what ensured more effectually the
slavery of the people, than even these branches of pre∣rogative,
was, the established principles of the times,
which attributed to the prince such an unlimited and
indefeizable power, as was supposed to be the origin
of all law, and could be bounded and circumscribed by
none. The homilies, published for the use of the
clergy, and which they were enjoined to read every
Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every where a
blind, and unlimited passive-obedience to the prince,
which, on no account, and under no pretence, is it
ever lawful for them, in the smallest article, to depart
from or infringe. Much noise has been made, because
some court chaplains, during the succeeding reigns,
were permitted to preach such doctrines; but there is
a great difference between these sermons, and discourses
published by authority, avowed by the prince and
council, and promulgated to the whole nation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gifford, a clergyman, was suspended in 1584, for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil magistrate. Neal, vol. I. p. 435.</NOTE>. So
<PB N="489" REF="548"/>
thoroughly were these principles imbibed by the people
during the reigns of Elizabeth and her immediate pre∣decessors,
that opposition to them was regarded as the
most flagrant sedition, and was not even rewarded by
that public praise and approbation, which can alone sup∣port
men under such dangers and difficulties, as attend
the resistance of tyrannical authority. It was only
during the next generation that the noble principles of
liberty took root, and spreading themselves, under the
shelter of puritanical absurdities, became fashionable
among the people.</P>
<P>IT is worth remarking, that the advantage, usually
ascribed to absolute monarchy, a greater regularity of
police and a more strict execution of the laws, did
not attend the former English government, tho' in
many respects it fell under that denomination: A de∣monstration
of this truth is contained in a judicious
paper, which is preserved by Strype<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 290.</NOTE>; and which was
wrote by an eminent justice of peace of Somersetshire,
in the year 1596, near the end of the Queen's reign,
when the authority of that princess may be supposed to
be fully corroborated, by time, and her maxims of go∣vernment
improved by long practice. This paper con∣tains
an account of the disorders which then prevailed
in the county of Somerset. The author says, that
forty persons had been there executed in a year for
robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five burnt
in the hand, thirty-seven whipt, one hundred and
eighty-three discharged: That those who were dis∣charged
were most wicked and desperate persons, who
never could come to any good, because they would not
work, and none would take them into service: That
notwithstanding this great number of indictments, the
<PB N="490" REF="549"/>
fifth part of the felonies committed in the county
were not brought to a trial, the greater number escaped
censure, either from the superior cunning of the felons,
the remissness of the magistrates, or the foolish lenity
of the people: That the rapines committed by the in∣finite
number of wicked, wandering, idle people were
intolerable to the poor countrymen, and obliged them
to a perpetual watch of their sheep-folds, their pastures,
their woods and their corn-fields: That the other
counties of England were in no better condition than
Somersetshire; and many of them were even in a worse:
That there were at least three or four hundred able∣bodied
vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft
and rapine; and who sometimes met in troops to the
number of sixty, and committed spoil on the inhabi∣tants:
That if all the felons of this kind were assem∣bled,
they would be able, if reduced to good subjection, to
give the greatest enemy her majesty has a strong battle:
And that the magistrates themselves were intimidated
from executing justice upon them; and there were ex∣amples
of justices of peace, who, after giving sentence
against rogues, had interposed to stop the execution of
their own sentence on account of the danger, which
hung over them from the confederates of these
felons.</P>
<P>IN the year 1575, the Queen complained in Parlia∣ment
of the bad execution of the laws; and threatened,
if the magistrates were not, for the future, more vigil∣ant,
that she would entrust authority to indigent and
needy persons, who would find an interest in the
more exact distribution of justice<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 234.</NOTE>. It appears, that
she was as good as her word. For in 1601, there
were great complaints made in Parliament of the ra∣pine
of justices of peace; and a member said, that this
<PB N="491" REF="550"/>
magistrate was an animal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVI.</NOTE> who, for half a dozen
of chickens, would dispense with a dozen of penal
statutes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 661—664.</NOTE>. It is not easy to account for this relaxation
of government, and neglect of police, during a reign
of so much vigour as that of Elizabeth. The small
revenue of the crown is the most likely cause that can
be assigned. The Queen had it not in her power to
interest a great number in assisting her to execute the
laws.</P>
<P>ON the whole, the English have no reason, from
the example of their ancestors, to be in love with the
picture of absolute monarchy; or to prefer the un∣limited
authority of the prince, and his unbounded
prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that sweet equality,
and that happy security, by which they are at present
distinguished above all nations of the universe. The
utmost that can be said in favour of the government of
that age (and perhaps it may be said with truth) is,
that the power of the prince, tho' really unlimited,
was exercised after the European manner, and entered
not into every part of the administration; that the in∣stances
of a high exerted prerogative were not so fre∣quent
as to render property sensibly insecure, or reduce
the people to a total servitude; that the freedom from
faction, the quickness of execution, and the promp∣titude
of those measures, which could be taken for
offence, or defence, made some compensation for the
want of a legal and determined liberty; that as the
prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a
tacit check on him, which maintained the government
in that medium, to which the people had been ac∣customed;
and that this situation of England was in
reality more remote from, tho' seemingly it approached
nearer to, a despotic and eastern monarchy, than the

<PB N="492" REF="553"/>
present government, of that kingdom, where the
people, tho' guarded by multiplied laws, are totally
naked, defenceless, and disarmed.</P>
<P>WE shall close this chapter with a brief account of
the revenues, the military force, the commerce, the
arts, and the learning of England during this
period.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth's oeconomy was very remarkable;
and in some instances seemed to border on avarice.
The smallest expence, if it could possibly be saved, ap∣peared
considerable in her eyes; and even the charge
of an express, during the most delicate transactions,
was not below her notice<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negot. p. 21.</NOTE>. She was also attentive to
every profit; and embraced opportunities of gain,
which may appear somewhat extraordinary. She kept
the see of Ely vacant nineteen years, in order to pocket
the revenue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 351.</NOTE>; and it was usual with her, when she
promoted a bishop, to take the opportunity of pillag∣ing
the see of some of its manors<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE>. But that there
was in reality little or no avarice in the Queen's temper
appears from this circumstance, that she never amassed
any treasure; and even re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used subsidies from the
Parliament, when she had no present occasion for them.
Yet we must not conclude from this circumstance, that
her oeconomy proceeded from a tender concern for her
people: She loaded them with monopolies and exclu∣sive
patents, which are infinitely more oppressive than
the most heavy taxes, levied in a legal and regular
manner. The real source of her frugal conduct was
derived from her desire of independency, and her care
to preserve her dignity, which would have been en∣dangered,
had she reduced herself to the necessity of
having frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies.
In consequence of this motive, the Queen, tho' en∣gaged
<PB N="493" REF="554"/>
in successful and necessary wars, thought it more
prudent to make a continual dilapidation of the royal
demesnes<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 141. D'Ewes, p. 151, 457, 525, 629. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 363.</NOTE>, than demand the most moderate supplies
from the commons. As she lived unmarried and had
no posterity, she was contented to serve her present
turn, tho' at the expence of her successors, who, by
reason of this policy, joined to other accidents, found
themselves, on a sudden, reduced to the most extreme
indigence.</P>
<P>THE splendor of a court was, during this age, a
great part of the public charge; and as Elizabeth was
a single woman, and expensive in no kind of magnifi∣cence,
except cloaths, this circumstance enabled her
to perform great things by her narrow revenue. She
is said to have paid four millions of debt, left on the
crown by her father, brother, and sister; and incredible
sum for that age<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 473. I think it impossible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that given by Strype, Eccles. Mem. vol. II. p. 344. that in the year 1553, the crown owed but 300,000 pounds. I own, that this last sum appears a great deal more likely. The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth would not in ten years have paid four millions.</NOTE>. The states at the time of her
death owned her about eight hundred thousand pounds:
And the King of France four hundred and fifty thou∣sand<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 29, 54.</NOTE>. Tho' that prince was extremely frugal, and
after the peace of Vervins, was continually amassing
treasure, the Queen never could, by the most pressing
remonstrances, prevail on him to make payment of
those sums, which she had so generously advanced him,
during his greatest distresses. One payment of twenty
thousand crowns, and another of fifty thousand, were
all she could obtain, by the strongest representations
she could make of the difficulties to which the rebellion
in Ireland had reduced her<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 117, 395.</NOTE>. The Queen expended
on the wars with Spain between 1589 and 1593, the
<PB N="494" REF="555"/>
sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds,
beside the double subsidy, amounting to two hundred
and eighty thousand pounds, granted her by Parlia∣ment<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 483.</NOTE>. In the year 1599 she spent six hundred
thousand pounds in six months in the service of Ire∣land
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 167.</NOTE>. Sir Robert Cecil affirmed, that in ten years
time, Ireland cost her three millions four hundred
thousand pounds<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Appendix to the earl of Essex's apology.</NOTE>. She gave the earl of Essex a pre∣sent
of thirty thousand pounds upon his departure for
the government of that kingdom<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II.</NOTE>. Lord Burleigh
computed that the value of the gifts conferred on that
favourite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds:
a proof of her strong affection towards him! It was
a common saying during this reign; <HI>The Queen pays
bountifully, tho' she rewards sparingly</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Nanton's Regalia, chap. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to compute exactly the Queen's ordi∣nary
revenue, but it certainly fell much short of five
hundred thousand pounds a year<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Franklyn in his annals p. 9, says that the profit of the kingdom, besides Wards and the dutchy of Lancaster (<HI>which amounted to about</HI> 120,000 <HI>pounds</HI>) was 188,197 pounds, the crown lands seem to be comprehended in this computation</NOTE>. In 1590, she raised
the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year to
fifty thousand, and obliged Sir Thomas Smith, who
had farmed them, to refund some of his former profits<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 558. This account of Camden is difficult or impossible to be reconciled to the state of the cu∣stoms in the beginning of the subsequnt reign, as they appear in the journals of the commons. See Hist. of James, chap. 1.</NOTE>.
This improvement of the revenue was owing to the
suggestions of one Caermarden; and was extremely
opposed by Burleigh, Leicester, and Walsingham. But
the Queen's perseverance overcame all their opposition.
The great undertakings, which she ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uted with so
narrow a revenue, and with such small supplies from
her people, prove the mighty effects of wisdom and
<PB N="495" REF="556"/>
oeconomy. She received from the Parliament, during
the course of her whole reign, only twenty subsidies
and thirty-nine fifteenths. It is not easy to compute
exactly the amount of these supplies; because the value
of a subsidy was continually falling; and in the end of
of her reign it amounted only to eighty thousand
pounds<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 630.</NOTE>, tho' in the beginning it had been an hundred
and twenty thousand. If we suppose that the supplies
granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years
amounted to three millions, we shall not probably be
much wide of the truth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Lord Salisbury computed them at two millions eight hundred thousand pounds. Journ. 17. February 1609. King James was certainly mistaken when he computed the Queen's supplies at 135,000 pounds a year. Franklyn, p. 49.</NOTE>. This sum makes only
sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pounds a
year; and it is surprizing, that while the Queen's de∣mands
were so moderate, and her expences so well re∣gulated,
she should ever have found any difficulty of
getting a supply from the Parliament, or be reduced
to make sale of the crown-lands. But such was the
extreme, I had almost said, absurd parsimony of the Par∣liaments
during that period. They valued nothing in
comparison of their money: The members had no
connexion with the court; and the very idea, which
they conceived of the trust committed to them, was,
to reduce the demands of the crown, and to grant as
few supplies as possible. The crown, on the other
hand, conceived the Parliament in no other light than
a means of supply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit
to her people of seldom assembling Parliaments<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 124.</NOTE>. No
redress of grievances was expected from these assemblies:
They were supposed to meet for no other purpose than
to impose taxes.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="557"/>
BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's reign, the English prin∣ces
had usually recourse to the city of Antwerp for vo∣luntary
loans; and their credit was so low, that, be∣sides
the exorbitant interest of ten or twelve per cent,
they were obliged to make the city of London join in
the security. Sir Thomas Gresham, that great and
enterprizing merchant, one of the chief ornaments of
this reign, engaged the company of merchant-adven∣turers
to grant a loan to the Queen; and as the money
was regularly paid, her credit by degrees established
itself in the city, and she shook off this dependance
on foreigners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey of London, book I. p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1559, the Queen employed Gresham to borrow
for her two hundred thousand pounds at Antwerp, in
order to enable her to reform the coinage, which was at
that time extremely debased<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Royston's from the paper office, p. 295.</NOTE>. She was so unpolitic
as to make herself an innovation in the coin; by di∣viding
a pound of silver into sixty-two shillings, in∣stead
of sixty, the former standard. This is the
last time, that the coin has been tampered with in
England.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth, sensible how much the defence
of her kingdom depended on its naval power, was de∣sirous
to encourage commerce and navigation: But as
her monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic indu∣stry,
which is much more valuable than foreign trade,
and is the foundation of it, the general train of her
conduct was very ill calculated to serve the purpose at
which she aimed, much less to promote the riches of
her people. The exclusive companies also were an
immediate check on foreign trade. Yet, notwithstand∣ing
these discouragements, the spirit of the age was
strongly bent on naval enterprizes; and besides, the
military expeditions against the Spaniards, many at∣tempts
<PB N="497" REF="558"/>
were made for new discoveries, and many new
branches of foreign commerce were opened by the
English. Sir Martin Forbisher undertook three fruit∣less
voyages to discover the north-west passage: Davis,
not disheartened by this ill success, made a new attempt,
when he discovered the straits, which pass by his name.
In 1600, the Queen granted the first patent to the
East Indian company: The stock of that company was
seventy-two thousand pounds; and they fitted out four
ships, under the command of James Lancaster, for this
new branch of trade. The adventure was successful;
and the ships, returning with a rich cargo, encouraged
the company to continue that commerce.</P>
<P>THE communication with Muscovy had been opened
in Queen Mary's time by the discovry of the passage
to Archangel: But the commerce to that country did
not begin to be carried to a great extent till about
the year 1569. The Queen obtained from the Czar
an exclusive patent to the English for the whole trade
to Muscovy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 408.</NOTE>; and she entered into a personal, as well
as national, alliance with him. This Czar was named
John Basilides, a most furious tyrant, who suspecting
continually the revolt of his subjects, stipulated to have
a safe retreat and protection in England. In order the
better to ensure himself of this resource, he proposed
to marry an English woman, and the Queen intended
to have sent him the lady Anne Hastings, daughter
to the earl of Huntingdon: But when the lady was
informed of the barbarous manners of the country,
she wisely declined purchasing an empire at the expence
of her ease and safety<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English, encouraged by the privileges, which
they had obtained from Basilides, ventured farther
into these countries, than any Europeans had formerly
<PB N="498" REF="559"/>
done. They transported their goods along the river
Dwina in boats made of one entire tree, which they
towed and rowed up the stream as far as Walogda.
From thence, they carried them seven days journey by
land to Yeraslau, and then down the Volga to Astra∣can.
At Astracan, they built ships, crossed the Caspian
Sea, and distributed their commodities into Persia.
But this bold attempt met with such discouragements
that it was never renewed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of John Basilides, his son Theo∣dore
revoked the patent, which the English enjoyed
for a monopoly of the Russian trade; and when the
Queen remonstrated against this innovation, he told,
her ministers, that princes must carry an indifferent
hand, as well between their subjects as between fo∣reigners;
and not convert trade, which by the laws
of nations ought to be common to all, into a mono∣poly
for the private gain of a few<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>. So much juster
notions of commerce were entertained by this barba∣rian,
than were practised by the renowned Queen
Elizabeth! Theodore, however, continued some pri∣vileges
to the English, on account of their being the
first discoverers of the communication between Europe
and his country.</P>
<P>THE trade to Turkey was begun about 1583;
and that commerce was immediately confined to a
company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, the
grand signior had always conceived England to be a
dependant province of France<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 36.</NOTE>; but having heard
of the Queen's power and reputation he gave a good
reception to the English, and even granted them larger
privileges than he had given to the French.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="560"/>
THE merchants of the Hanse-towns complained
loudly in the beginning of Elizabeth's reign of the treat∣ment,
which they had received in the days of King
Edward and Queen Mary. She very prudently replied,
that as she would not innovate any thing, she would
protect them still in the immunities and privileges, which
she found them possessed of. This answer not con∣tenting
them, their commerce was soon after suspended
for a time, to the great advantage of the English mer∣chants,
who tried what they could themselves effectu∣ate
for the promotion of their own industry. They
took the whole trade into in their own hands: and
their returns proving successful, they divided themselves
into staplers and merchant-adventurers; the former
residing constantly at one place, the other trying their
fortunes in other towns and states abroad with cloth
and other manufactures. This success so enraged the
Hanse-towns, that they tried all the methods, which
a discontented people could devise, to draw upon the
English merchants the ill opinion of other nations
and states. They prevailed so far as to obtain an im∣perial
edict, by which the English merchants were pro∣hibited
all commerce in the empire: The Queen, by
way of retaliation, retained sixty of their ships, which
had been seized in the river of Lisbon with contraband
goods of the Spaniards. These ships the Queen in∣tended
to have restored, as desiring to have compromised
all differences with those trading cities; but when
she was informed, that a general assembly was held
at Lubec, in order to concert measures for distressing
the English trade, she caused the ships and cargoes
to be confiscated; only two of them were released to
carry home the news, and to inform these states, that
she had the greatest contempt imaginable for all their
proceedings<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="500" REF="561"/>
HENRY the eighth, in order to fit out a navy, was
obliged to hire ships from Hamburg, Lubec, Dantzick,
Genoa, and Venice: But Elizabeth, very early in
her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by
building some ships of her own, and by encouraging
the merchants to build large trading vessels, which,
on occasion, were converted into ships of war<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>. In
1582, the seamen in England were computed at four∣teen
thousand two hundred and ninety-five men<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 256.</NOTE>;
the number of vessels twelve hundred and thirty-two;
of which there were only two hundred and seventeen
above eighty tons. Monson computes, that tho' the
navigation decayed in the first years of James the first,
by the practice of the merchants, who carried on their
trade in foreign bottoms<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>, yet before 1640, this num∣ber
of seamen was trebled in England<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 210, 256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy which the Queen left at her decease ap∣pears
considerable, when we reflect only on the num∣ber
of vessels, which were forty-two: But when we
consider that none of these ships carried above forty
guns; that four only came up to that number; that
there were but two ships of a thousand ton; and
twenty-three below five hundred, some of fifty, and
some even of twenty tons; that the whole number of
the guns belonging to the fleet were seven hundred and
seventy-four<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Monson, p. 196. The English navy at present carries about 14000 guns.</NOTE>; we must entertain a very contemptible
idea of the English navy compared to the force which
it has now attained. In the year 1588, there were
not above five vessels, equipped by the noblemen and
sea-ports, which exceeded two hundred tons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1599, an alarm was given of an invasion from
the Spaniards; and the Queen equipped a fleet and
<PB N="501" REF="562"/>
levied an army in a fortnight to oppose them. Nothing
gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of England
than this sudden armament. In 1575, all the militia
in the kingdom were computed at an hundred and
eighty-two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 432.</NOTE>.
A distribution was made, in 1595, of an hundred
and forty thousand men, besides those which Wales
could supply<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 221.</NOTE>. These armies were formidable by their
numbers; but their discipline and experience were not
proportional. Small bodies from Dunkirk and New∣port
frequently ran over, and plundered the east coast:
So unfit was the militia, as it was then constituted, for
the defence of the kingdom. The lord lieutenants
were first appointed to the counties in this reign.</P>
<P>MR. MURDEN<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">p. 608.</NOTE> has published a paper, which con∣tains
the military force of the nation at the time of
the Spanish Armada, and which is somewhat different
from the account given by our ordinary historians. It
makes all the able-bodied men of the kingdom amount
to an hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and
thirteen; those armed, to eighty thousand eight hun∣dred
and seventy-five; of whom forty four thousand
seven hundred and twenty-seven were trained. It must
be supposed that these able-bodied men consisted of
such only as were registered, otherwise the small num∣ber
is not to be accounted for. Yet Sir Edward<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Journ. 25. April, 1621.</NOTE> said in
the House of Commons, that he was employed about
the same time, together with Popham, Lord Chief
Justice, to take a survey of all the people of England,
and that they found them to be 900,000 of all sorts.
This number, by the ordinary rules of computation,
supposes, that there were above 200,000 men able to
bear arms. Yet even this number is surprizingly small.
<PB N="502" REF="563"/>
Can we suppose thus the kingdom is seven times more
populous at present? And that Murden's was the real
number of men, excluding catholics and infirm per∣sons?</P>
<P>WHATEVER opinion we may form of the compara∣tive
populousness of England in these two periods, it
must be allowed, that there is a prodigious encrease of
power, in that, more perhaps than in any other Euro∣pean
state, since the beginning of the last century.
It would be no paradox to affirm, that Ireland alone
could at present exert a greater force than all the three
kingdoms were capable of at the death of Queen
Elizabeth. And we might go farther, and assert, that
one good county of England is capable of making, at
least of supporting, a greater effort than the whole
kingdom was in the reign of Harry V; when the main∣tainance
of a garrison in a small town, like Calais,
formed more than a third of the ordinary national ex∣pence.
Such are the effects of liberty, industry, and
good government!</P>
<P>THE state of the English manufactures was at this
time very low, and foreign wares of almost all kinds
had the preference<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 505.</NOTE>. About 1590, there were in
London four persons only rated in the subsidy-books so
high as four hundred pounds<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 497.</NOTE>. This computation is
not indeed to be deemed an exact estimate of their
wealth. In 1567, there were found on enquiry to be
four thousand eight hundred and fifty-one strangers of
all nations in London: Of whom three thousand eight
hundred and thirty-eight were Flemings, and only fifty∣eight
Scots<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 461, 462.</NOTE>. The persecutions in France and the
Low Countries drove after wards a greater number of
foreigners into England; and the commerce, as well
<PB N="503" REF="564"/>
as manufactures, of the kingdom was very much im∣proved
by them<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 668.</NOTE>. It was then that Sir Thomas
Gresham built, at his own charge, the magnificent
fabric of the Exchange for the reception of the mer∣chants:
The Queen visited it, and gave it the appella∣tion
of the Royal Exchange.</P>
<P>THERE were two attempts made in this reign to
settle colonies in America; one by Sir Humphry Gil∣bert
in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter Raleigh
in Virginia: But neither of these projects proved suc∣cessful.
All these noble settlements were made in the
following reigns. The current money of the king∣dom,
in the end of this reign, is computed at four mil∣lions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 475.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE nobility in this age supported still, in some de∣gree,
the ancient magnificence in their hospitality, and
in the numbers of their retainers; and the Queen found
it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their ex∣pences
in this last particular<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 54.</NOTE>. The expence of hos∣pitality,
she somewhat encouraged, by the frequent
visits she paid her nobility, and the magnificent feasts
which she received from them. The earl of Leicester
gave her an entertainment in Kenilworth castle, which
was extraordinary for expence and magnificence.
Among other particulars, we are told, that three hun∣dred
and sixty-five hogsheeds of beer were drank at it<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Biogr, Brit. vol. III. p. 1791.</NOTE>.
The earl had fortified this castle at great expence; and
it contained arms for ten thousand men<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 394.</NOTE>. The earl
of Derby had a family consisting of two hundred and
forty servants<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 674.</NOTE>. Stowe remarks it as a singular proof
of beneficence in this nobleman, that he was con∣tented
with his rent from his tenants, and exacted not
<PB N="504" REF="565"/>
any extraordinary services from them: A proof that
the absolute power of the sovereign (what was almost
unavoidable) had very generally countenanced the no∣bility
in tyrannizing over the people. Burleigh, tho'
he was frugal, and had no paternal estate, kept a fa∣mily
consisting of an hundred servants<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol III. p. 129. Appen.</NOTE>. He had a
standing table for gentlemen, and two other tables for
persons of meaner condition, which were always served
alike, whether he was in town or in the country.
About his person he had people of great distinction,
insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen
retainers who had each a thousand pounds a year; and
as many among his ordinary servants, who were worth
from a thousand pounds to three, five, ten, and twenty
thousand pounds<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Biogr, Brit. p. 1267.</NOTE>. It is to be remarked, that, tho'
the revenue of the crown was at that time very small,
the ministers and courtiers found means, by employing
the exorbitant prerogative, to acquire much greater
fortunes than it is possible for them at present to
gain, from their larger salaries, and more limited au∣thority.</P>
<P>BUT
tho' there were preserved great remains of the
ancient customs, the nobility were, by degrees,
acquiring a taste of elegant luxury; and many edifices,
in particular, were built by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, neat, large, and
sumptuous, to the great ornament of the kingdom, says
Camden<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Page 452.</NOTE>; but to the no less decay of the glorious
hospitality of the nation. It is, however, more rea∣sonable
to think, that this new turn of expence pro∣moted
arts and industry; while the ancient hospitality
was the source of vice, disorder, sedition, and idle∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="566"/>
AMONG the other species of luxury, that of apparel
began much to increase during this age; and the Queen
thought proper to restrain it by proclamation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>. Her
example was very little conformable to her edicts. As
no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty,
nor more desirous of making impression on the hearts
of beholders, no one ever went to a greater extrava∣gance
in apparel, or studied more the variety and rich∣ness
of her dresses. She appeared almost every day in
a different habit; and tried all the several modes, by
which she hoped to render herself agreeable. She was
also so fond of her cloaths, that she never could part with
any of them; and at her death she had in her wardrobe
all the different habits, to the number of three thousand,
which she had ever worn in her life-time<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. III. p. 702. from Beaumont's Dispatches.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE retrenchment of the ancient hospitality, and
the diminution of retainers, were favourable to the
prerogative of the sovereign; and by disabling the great
noblemen from resistance, promoted the execution of
the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of
justice. There were many particular causes in the
situation and character of Henry the seventh, which
augmented the authority of the crown: Most of these
causes concurred in succeeding princes; together with
the factions of religion, and the acquisition of the su∣premacy,
a most important article of prerogative: But
the manners of the age were a general cause, which
operated during this whole period, and which continu∣ally
tended to diminish the riches, and still more the
influence, of the Aristocracy, anciently so formidable
to the crown. The habits of luxury dissipated the
immense fortunes of the ancient barons; and as the
new methods of expence gave subsistance to mechanics
<PB N="506" REF="567"/>
and merchants, who lived in an independant manner on
the fruits of their own industry, a nobleman, instead of
that unlimited ascendant which he was wont to assume
over those who were maintained at his board, or sub∣sisted
by salaries conferred on them, retained only that
moderate influence which customers have over trades∣men,
and which can never be dangerous to civil go∣vernment.
The landed proprietors also having a greater
demand for money than for men, endeavoured to turn
their lands to the best account with regard to profit,
and either inclosing their fields, or joining many small
farms into a few large ones, dismissed those useless
hands which formerly were always at their call, in
every attempt to subvert the government, or oppose a
neighbouring baron. By all these means the cities in∣creased;
the middle rank of men began to be rich and
powerful; the prince, who in effect was the same
with the law, was implicitly obeyed; and tho' the
farther progress of the same causes begot a new plan
of liberty, founded on the privileges of the commons,
yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the
rise of this order, the sovereign took advantage of the
present situation, and assumed an authority almost
absolute.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be commonly imagined, from the
authority of lord Bacon, and from that of Harring∣ton,
and later authors, the laws of Henry the seventh
contributed very little towards the great revolutions
which happened about this period in the English con∣stitution.
The practice of breaking entails, by a fine
and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding
reigns; and this prince only gave indirectly a legal
sanction to the practice, by reforming some abuses
which attended it. But the settled authority, which he
acquired to the crown, enabled the sovereign to en∣croach
on the separate jurisdictions of the barons, and
<PB N="507" REF="568"/>
produced a more general and regular execution of the
laws. The counties palatine underwent the same fate
as the feudal jurisdictions; and by a statute of Henry
the eighth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 24.</NOTE>, the jurisdiction of these counties was an∣nexed
to the crown, and all writs were ordained to
run in the King's name. But the change of manners
was the chief cause of the secret revolution of the
government, and subverted the power of the ba∣rons.</P>
<P>LEARNING,
on its first revival, was held in great
estimation by the English princes and nobles; and as
it was not yet prostituted by being too common, even
the Great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a
character for literature. The four successive sovereigns,
Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one
account or other, be admitted into the class of authors.
Queen Catherine Parr translated a book: Lady Jane
Gray, considering her age, and her sex, and her sta∣tion,
may be regarded as a prodigy of literature. Sir
Thomas Smith was raised from being professor in Cam∣bridge,
first to be ambassador to France, and then
secretary of state. The dispatches of those times, and
among others those of Burleigh himself, are very fre∣quently
interlarded with quotations from the Greek
and Latin classics. Even the ladies of the court va∣lued
themselves on knowlege: Lady Burleigh, lady
Bacon, and their two sisters, were mistresses of the
ancient, as well as modern languages; and valued them∣selves
more on their erudition than on their rank and
quality.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth wrote and translated several
books; and she was familiarly acquainted with the
Greek as well as Latin tongue. It is pretended, that
<PB N="508" REF="569"/>
she made an extemporary reply in Greek to the uni∣versity
of Cambridge, who had addressed her in that
language. It is certain, that she answered in Latin,
without premeditation, and in a very spirited manner,
to the Polish ambassador, who had been wanting in
respect to her. When she had finished, she turned
about to her courtiers, and said, “God's death, my
lord,” (for she was much addicted to swearing) “I
have been forced this day to scour up my old Latin,
that hath long lain rusting<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Speed.</NOTE>.” Elizabeth, even after
she was Queen, did not entirely drop the ambition
of appearing as an author; and next to her desire of
admiration for beauty, this seems to have been the
chief object of her vanity. She translated Boethius of
the Consolation of Philosophy; in order, as she pre∣tended,
to allay her grief for Henry the fourth's change
of religion. As far as we can judge from Elizabeth's
compositions, we may pronounce, that notwithstanding
her application, and her excellent parts, her taste in
literature was very indifferent: She was even inferior
to her successor in this particular, who was himself
far from being a just model of eloquence.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for literature, at least for the learned of
this age, the Queen's vanity lay more in shining by
her own learning, than in encouraging men of genius
by her liberality. Spencer himself, the finest English
writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the
death of Sir Philip Sydney, his patron, was allowed to
die almost for want. This poet contains great beauties,
a sweet and harmonious versification, easy elocution, a
fine imagination; Yet does the perusal of his work
become so tedious, that one never finishes it from the
mere pleasure which it affords: It soon becomes a
kind of task-reading; and it requires some effort
<PB N="509" REF="570"/>
and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long
performance. This effect, of which every one is con∣scious,
is usually ascribed to the change of manners:
But manners have more changed since Homer's age;
and yet that poet remains still the favourite of every
reader of taste and judgment. Homer copied true na∣tural
manners, which, however rough or uncultivated,
will always form an agreeable and interesting picture:
But the pencil of the English poet was employed in
drawing the affections, and conceits, and fopperies
of chivalry, which appear ridiculous as soon as they
lose the recommendation of the mode. The tedious∣ness
of continued allegory, and that too seldom strik∣ing
or ingenious, has also contributed to render the
<HI>Fairy Queen</HI> peculiarly tiresome; not to mention the
too great frequency of its descriptions, and the langour
of its stanza. Upon the whole, Spencer maintains his
place in the shelves among our English classics: But
he is seldom seen on the table; and there is scarce any
one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confess, that,
notwithstanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an
entertainment with which the palate is soon satiated.
Several writers of late have amused themselves in copy∣ing
the stile of Spencer; and no imitation has been
so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance of the
original: His manner is so peculiar, that it is almost
impossible not to transfer some of it into the copy.

<P>THE crown of England was never transmitted
from father to son with greater tranquillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLV.</NOTE> than
it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart.
During the whole reign of Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1603.</NOTE> the eyes of men
had been employed in search of her successor; and when
old age made the prospect of her death more imme∣diate,
there appeared none but the King of Scotland,
who could advance any just claim or pretension to the
throne. He was the great-grandson of Margaret, el∣dest
daughter of Henry VII. and, on the failure of all
the male-line, his hereditary right remained unquesti∣onable.
If the religion of Mary Queen of Scots, and
the other prejudices contracted against her, had formed
any considerable obstacle to her succession; these ob∣jections,
being entirely personal, had no place with
regard to her son. Men also considered, that, tho'
the title, derived from blood, had been frequently vio∣lated
since the Norman conquest, such licences had
proceeded more from force or intrigue, than from any
deliberate maxims of government. The lineal heir
had still in the end prevailed; and both his exclusion
and restoration had been commonly attended with such
convulsions, as were sufficient to warn all prudent
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not lightly to give way to such irregularities. If
the will of Henry VIII. authorised by act of parlia∣ment,
had tacitly excluded the Scottish line; the ty∣ranny
and caprices of that monarch had rendered his
memory so odious, that a settlement of this nature, un∣supported
<PB N="511" REF="574"/>
by any just reason, had no authority with
the people. Queen Elizabeth too, with her dying
breath, had recognized the undoubted title of her kins∣man
James; and the whole nation seemed to dispose
themselves with joy and pleasure for his reception. Tho'
born and educated amidst a foreign and hostile people,
men hoped, from his character of moderation and wis∣dom,
that he would embrace the maxims of an English
monarch; and the prudent foresaw greater advanta∣ges,
resulting from an union with Scotland, than dis∣advantages
from submitting to a prince of that nation.
The alacrity, with which the English looked towards
the successor, had apppeared so evident to Elizabeth,
that, concurring with other causes, it affected her with
the deepest melancholy; and that wise Princess, whose
penetration and experience had given her the greatest
insight into human affairs, had not yet sufficiently
weighed the ingratitude of courtiers, and levity of the
people.</P>
<P>As victory abroad, and tranquillity at home, had
ever attended this Queen, she left the nation in such
flourishing circumstances, that her successor possessed
every advantage, except that of comparison with her
illustrious name, when he mounted the throne of Eng∣land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">First
trans∣actions of this reign.</NOTE> The King's journey from Edinburgh to Lon∣don
immediately afforded to the inquisitive some cir∣cumstances
of comparison, which even the natural par∣tiality
in favour of their new sovereign, could not in∣terpret
to his advantage. As he passed along, all ranks
of men flocked about him, from every quarter; allured
by interest or curiosity. Great were the rejoicings,
and loud and hearty the acclamations which resounded
from all sides; and every one could remember how
the affability and popularity of their Queen displayed
themselves, amidst such concourse and exultation of
<PB N="512" REF="575"/>
her subjects. But James, tho' sociable and familiar
with his friends and courtiers, hated the bustle of a
mixt multitude; and tho' far from disliking flattery,
yet was he still fonder of tranquillity and ease. He
therefore issued a proclamation, forbidding this great
resort of people, on pretence of the scarcity of provi∣sions,
and other inconveniencies, which would ne∣cessarily
attend it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Kennet. p. 662.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE was not, however, insensible to the great over∣flow
of affection, which appeared in his new subjects;
and being himself of an affectionate temper, he seems
to have been in haste to make them some return of kind∣ness
and good offices. To this motive, probably, we
are to ascribe that profusion of titles, which was ob∣served
in the beginning of his reign; when in six weeks
time, after his entrance into the kingdom, he is com∣puted
to have bestowed knighthood on no less than
237 persons. If Queen Elizabeth's frugality of hon∣ours,
as well as of money, had been formerly repined
at, it began now to be valued and esteemed: And every
one was sensible, that the King, by his lavish and pre∣mature
conferring of favours, had failed of obliging
the persons, on whom he bestowed them. Titles of
all kinds became so common, that they were no longer
marks of distinction; and being distributed, without
choice or deliberation, to persons, unknown to the
Prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility
and good-nature, than of any determined friendship
or esteem.</P>
<P>A pasquinade was affixed to St Paul's, in which an
art was promised to be taught, very necessary to assist
frail memories, in retaining the names of the new
Nobility<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wilson, in Kennet, p. 665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="576"/>
WE may presume, that the English would have
thrown less blame on the King's facility in bestowing
favours, had these been confined entirely to their own
nation, and had not been shared out, in too unequal
proportions, to his old subjects. James, who, thro'
his whole reign, was more guided by temper and in∣clination
than by the rules of political prudence, had
brought with him great numbers of his Scots courtiers;
whose impatience and importunity were apt, in many
particulars, to impose on the easy nature of their master,
and extort favours, of which, it is natural to imagine,
his English subjects would very loudly complain. The
Duke of Lenox, the Earl of Mar, the Lord Hume,
Lord Kinloss, Sir George Hume, Secretary Elphin∣stone<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wilson in Kennet, p. 662.</NOTE>, were immediately added to the English privy
council. Sir George Hume, whom he created Earl of
Dunbar, was his declared favourite as long as that
Nobleman lived; and was the wisest and most virtuous,
tho' the least powerful, of all those whom the King
ever honoured with that distinction. Hay, some time
after, was created Viscount Doncaster, and then Earl
of Carlisle, and got an immense fortune from the
crown; all which he spent in a splendid and courtly
manner. Ramsay obtained the title of Earl of Holder∣ness;
and many others, being raised, on a sudden, to
the highest elevation, encreased, by their insolence,
that envy, which naturally attended them, as enemies
and strangers.</P>
<P>IT must, however, be owned, in justice to James,
that he left almost all the chief offices in the hands of
Elizabeth's ministers, and trusted the conduct of poli∣tical
concerns, both foreign and domestic, to his Eng∣lish
subjects. Among these, Secretary Cecil, created
successively Lord Essindon, Viscount Cranborne, and
<PB N="512" REF="577"/>

<PB N="513" REF="578"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="514" REF="579"/>
Earl of Salisbury, was always regarded as his prime
minister and chief counsellor. Tho' the capacity and
penetration of this minister were sufficiently known,
his favour with the King created great surprize on the
accession of that monarch. Cecil was son of the fa∣mous
Burleigh, whose merits towards his sovereign
and his country were great, but whose name was na∣turally
odious to James; as the declared enemy of his
mother, and the chief cause of her tragical death, by
some esteemed the great stain in the bright annals of
Elizabeth. He himself, as well as his father, had stood
at the head of the court-faction, which opposed the
greatness of the Earl of Essex, and which, assisted by
the imprudence or rather frenzy of that favourite, at
last brought him to the scaffold. The people, by whom
the Earl was infinitely beloved, refented the conduct of
his enemies; but James still more, who had main∣tained
a secret correspondence with Essex, and regarded
him as a zealous partizan for the succession in the house
of Stuart. Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey, Lord
Cobham, Cecil's associates, felt immediately the effects
of these prejudices of their master, and were dismissed
from their employments<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 663.</NOTE>: But Cecil, who possessed
all the art and cunning of a courtier, as well as many
of the talents of a great statesman, had found the means
of making his peace with James; and, unknown both
to Elizabeth and all the other ministers, had entered
into a secret commerce with the successor, during the
latter years of the Queen's administration.</P>
<P>THE capacity of James and his ministers in negoti∣ation
was immediately put to trial, on the appear∣ance
of ambassadors from almost all the princes and
states of Europe, in order to congratulate the King
on his accession to the throne, and to form with him
<PB N="515" REF="580"/>
new treaties and alliances. Beside ministers from
Venice, Denmark, the Palatinate; Henry Frederic of
Nassau, assisted by Barnevelt the Pensionary of Holland,
represented the states of the United Provinces. Arem∣berg
was sent by Archduke Albert; and Taxis was ex∣pected
in a little time from Spain. But he who ex∣cited
most the attention of the public, both on account
of his own merit and that of his master, was the Mar∣quess
of Rosni,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE> afterwards Duke of Sully, prime mi∣nister
and favourite of Henry IV. of France.</P>
<P>WHEN the dominions of the house of Austria devolv∣ed
on Philip II. all Europe was struck with terror;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu∣rope.</NOTE> lest
the power of a family, which had been raised by fortune,
should now be carried to an immeasurable height, by
the wisdom and conduct of this monarch. But never
were apprehensions found in the event to be more
groundless. Slow without prudence, ambitious with∣out
enterprize, false without deceiving any body,
and refined without any true judgement; such
was the character of Philip and such the cha∣racter,
which during his life-time and after his death,
he impressed on the Spanish councils. Revolted or
depopulated provinces, discontented or indolent inha∣bitants,
were the spectacles, which those dominions,
lying in every climate of the globe, presented to Philip
III. a weak prince, and to the Duke of Lerma, a mi∣nister,
weak and odious. But tho' military discipline,
which still remained, was what alone gave some appear∣ance
of life and vigour to that languishing body; yet
such was the terror, produced by former power and am∣bition,
that the reduction of the house of Austria was
the object of men's vows, throughout all the states of
christendom. It was not perceived, that the French
empire, now united in domestic peace, and governed
by the most heroic and most amiable prince, that adorns
modern story, was become, of itself, a sufficient coun∣terpoise
<PB N="516" REF="581"/>
to the Spanish greatness. Perhaps, that prince
himself did not perceive it, when he proposed, by his
minister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rosni's ne∣gotiations.</NOTE> a league with James, in conjunction with Ve∣nice,
the United Provinces, and the northern crowns;
in order to attack the Austrian dominions on every side,
and depress the exorbitant power of that ambitious
family<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs.</NOTE>. But the genius of the English monarch was
not equal to such vast enterprizes. The love of peace
was his ruling passion; and it was his peculiar felicity,
that the conjunctures of the times rendered the same
object which was agreeable to him, in the highest de∣gree
advantageous to his people.</P>
<P>THE French ambassador, therefore, was obliged to
depart from these extensive aims, and to concert with
James the means of providing for the safety of the Unit∣ed
Provinces: Nor was this object altogether without
its difficulties. The King, before his accession to the
throne of England, had entertained very strong scruples
with regard to the revolt of the Low Countries; and
being always open and sincere<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Monsieur de la Boderie, the French leaguer, ambassador at that time in England, ascribes the virtue of openness and sincerity to the King. <HI>Le naturel du Roi est assez ouvert.</HI> vol. i. p. 120.</NOTE>, except when delibe∣rately
resolved to dissemble, he had, on many occasions,
gone so far as to give to the Dutch the denomination
of rebels, but having conversed more fully with English
ministers and courtiers, he found their attachment to that
republic so strong, and their opinion of common interest so
established, that he was obliged to sacrifice to politics his
sense of justice; a quality, which, even when errone∣ous,
is respectable as well as rare in a monarch. He
therefore agreed with Rosni to support secretly the
states-general, in concert with the King of France;
lest their weakness and despair should oblige them to
submit to their old master. The articles of the treaty
were few and simple. It was stipulated, that the two<NOTE PLACE="foot">s Winwood, vol. 2. p. 55.</NOTE>
<PB N="517" REF="582"/>
Kings should allow the Dutch to levy forces both in
France and Britain; and should underhand remit to
that republic the sum of 1,400,000 livres a year for the
pay of these forces: That the whole sum should be
advanced by the King of France; but that the third
of it should be deducted from a debt due by him to
Queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniard attacked either
of the Princes, they agreed to assist each other; Henry
with a force of ten thousand, James with that of six
thousand men. This treaty, one of the wisest and most
equitable concluded by James, during the whole course
of his reign, was more the work of the Prince himself,
than any of his ministers<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST the great tranquillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raleigh's conspiracy.</NOTE> both foreign and do∣mestic,
with which the nation was blest, nothing could
be more surprising than the discovery of a conspiracy
to subvert the government, and to fix on the throne of
England Arabella Stuart, a near relation of the King,
and descended equally from Henry VII. Every thing
remains still mysterious in this conspiracy; and history
can give us no clue to unravel it. Watson and Clarke,
two catholic priests, were accused of the plot: Lord
Grey, a puritan: Lord Cobham, a thoughtless man
of no fixt principle: And Sir Walter Raleigh, sus∣pected
to be of that philosophical sect, who were then
extremely rare in England, and who have since received
the appellation of <HI>free-thinkers.</HI> Together with these,
Mr. Broke, brother to Lord Cobham, Sir Griffin Mark∣ham,
Mr. Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What ce∣ment
could unite men of such discordant principles in
so dangerous a combination; what end they proposed,
or what means proportioned to an undertaking of this
nature, has never yet been explained, and cannot easily
be imagined. As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were
<PB N="518" REF="583"/>
commonly believed, after the Queen's death, to have
opposed proclaiming the King, till conditions should
be made with him; they were, upon that, as well as
other accounts, extremely obnoxious to the court and
ministry; and people were apt, at first, to suspect, that
the plot was merely a contrivance of Secretary Cecil,
to get rid of his old confederates, now become his most
inveterate enemies. But the confession, as well as trial
of the criminals, put the matter beyond all doubt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 180. 2d Edit. Winwood Vol. 2. p. 8, 11.</NOTE>.
And tho' no one could find any marks of a concerted
enterprize, it appeared, that men of furious and am∣bitious
spirits, meeting frequently together, and believ∣ing
all the world discontented like themselves, had enter∣tained
very criminal projects, and had even entered,
some of them at least, into a correspondence with Arem∣berg,
the Flemish ambassador, in order to give disturbance
to the new settlement.</P>
<P>THE two priests<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">November 29.</NOTE> and Broke<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">December 5.</NOTE> were executed: Cob∣ham,
Grey, and Marham were pardoned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">December 3.</NOTE>, after they
had laid their heads upon the block<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Raleigh too
was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in con∣finement
many years afterwards.</P>
<P>IT appears from Sully's Memoirs, that Raleigh secretly
offered his services to the French ambassador; and we
may thence presume, that, meeting with a repulse from
that quarter, he had recourse, for the same unwarran∣table
purposes, to the Flemish minister. Such a con∣jecture
we are now enabled to form; but it must be
confessed, that, on his trial, there appeared no proof
of this transaction, nor indeed any circumstance which
could justify his condemnation. He was accused by
Cobham alone, in a sudden fit of passion, upon hear∣ing,
that Raleigh, when examined, had pointed out
<PB N="519" REF="584"/>
some circumstances, by which Cobham's guilt might
be known and ascertained. This accusation Cobham
afterwards retracted; and soon after, retracted his re∣tractation.
Yet, upon the written evidence of this
single witness, a man of no honour nor understand∣ing,
and so contradictory in his testimony; not con∣fronted
with Raleigh; not supported by any concur∣ring
circumstance; was that great man, contrary to
all law and equity, found guilty by the jury. His name
was at that time extremely odious in England; and
every man was pleased to give sentence against the
capital enemy of Essex, the favourite of the people.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attor∣ney-general,
managed the cause for the crown, and
threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse, as may be
deemed a great reflection, not only on his own me∣mory,
but even, in some degree, on the manners of
that age. Traitor, monster, viper, and spider of hell,
are the terms, which he employs against one of the most
illustrious men of the kingdom, who was under trial
for life and fortune, and who defended himself with
surprising temper, eloquence, and courage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">State Trials, 1st Edit. p. 176, 177, 182.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next occupation of the King was entirely ac∣cording
to his heart's content.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1604.</NOTE> He was now employed,
in dictating magisterially to an assembly of divines con∣cerning
points of faith and discipline, and in receiving
the applauses of these holy men for his superior zeal
and learning. The religious disputes between the
church and the puritans had induced him to call a con∣ference
at Hampton-court, on pretence of finding ex∣pedients,
which might reconcile both parties.</P>
<P>THO' the severities of Elizabeth towards the catho∣lics
had much weakened that party, whose genius was
averse to the prevailing spirit of the nation; like seve∣rities
<PB N="520" REF="585"/>
had had so little influence on the puritans, who
were encouraged by that spirit, that no less than seven
hundred and fifty clergymen of that party signed a
petition to the King on his accession; and many more
seemed willing to adhere to it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fuller Book, 10. Collier vol. 2. p. 672.</NOTE>. They all hoped,
that James, having received his education in Scotland,
and having ever professed an attachment to the church
established there, would at least abate the rigour of the
laws enacted against puritans; if he did not show them
more particular grace and encouragement. But the
King's disposition had taken strongly a contrary byass.
The more he knew the puritanical clergy, the less fa∣vour
he bore them. He had remarked in their Scots
brethren a violent turn towards republicanism, and a
zealous attachment to civil liberty; principles nearly
allied to that religious enthusiasm, with which they were
actuated. He had found, that being mostly persons
of low birth and mean education, the same lofty pre∣tensions,
which attended them in their familiar ad∣dresses
to their Maker, of whom they believed them∣selves
the peculiar favourites, induced them to use the
utmost freedoms with their earthly sovereign. In both
capacities, of monarch and of theologian, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ad expe∣rienced
the little complaisance, which they were dis∣posed
to show him; whilst they controuled his com∣mands,
disputed his tenets, and to his face, before the
whole people, censured his conduct and behaviour.
If he had submitted to the indignity of courting their
favour, he treasured up the stronger resentment against
them, and was determined to make them feel, in their
turn, the weight of his authority. Tho' he had often
met with resistance and faction and obstinacy in the
Scots nobility, he retained no ill-will to that order; or
rather showed them favour and kindness in England,
<PB N="521" REF="586"/>
beyond what reason and sound policy could well justify:
But the ascendant, which the presbyterian clergy had
assumed over him, was what his monarchical pride could
never thoroughly digest<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">James ventured to say in his Basilicon Doron, published while he was in Scotland: “I protest before the great God, and since I am here as upon my Testament, it is no place for me to lie in, that ye shall never find with any Highland or Borderer Thieves, greater ingratitude and more lyes and vile perjuries, than with these fanatic spirits: And suffer not the principal of them to brook your land.” <HI>K. James Works,</HI> p. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE dreaded likewise the popularity, which attended
this order of men in both kingdoms. As useless au∣sterities
and self-denial are imagined, in many religi∣ons,
to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being,
who created us solely for happiness, James remarked,
that the rustic severity of these clergymen and of their
whole sect had given them, in the eyes of the multi∣tude,
the appearance of sanctity and virtue. Strongly
inclined himself to mirth and wine and sports of all
kinds, he apprehended their censure for his manner
of life, free and disengaged. And, being thus averse,
from temper as well as policy, to the sect of puritans,
he was resolved, if possible, to prevent it's further growth
in England.</P>
<P>BUT it was the character of James's councils,
throughout his whole reign, that they were more wise
and equitable, in their end, than prudent and political,
in the means. Tho' justly sensible, that no part of ci∣vil
administration required greater care or a nicer judg∣ment
than the conduct of religious parties, whose va∣rious
geniuses, affections and antipathies, have so mighty
an influence on public affairs; he had not perceived,
that in the same proportion as this practical knowlege
of theology is requisite, the speculative refinements in
it are mean, and even dangerous in a monarch. By
entering zealously into frivolous disputes, James gave
them an air of importance and dignity, which they could
<PB N="522" REF="587"/>
not otherwise have acquired; and being himself in∣listed
in the quarrel, he could no longer have recourse
to contempt and ridicule, the only proper method of
appeasing it. The church of England had not yet
abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and predestina∣tion:
The puritans had not yet totally separated them∣selves
from the church, nor openly renounced episco∣pacy.
Tho' the spirit of the parties was considerably
different, the only apparent subjects of dispute were con∣cerning
the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, the
use of the surplice, and the bowing at the name of Je∣sus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference at Hampton-court.</NOTE>
These were the mighty questions, which were
solemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton-court
between some bishops and dignified clergymen on the
one hand, and some leaders of the puritan party on the
other; the king and his ministers being present<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Ecclesiast. History.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain
of a partial and unfair management of the dispute;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> as
if the search after truth were in any degree the object
of such conferences, and a candid indifference, so rare
even among private inquirers in <HI>philosophical</HI> questions,
could ever be expected among princes and prelates, in
a <HI>theological</HI> controversy. The King, it must be con∣fessed,
from the beginning of the Conference, showed
the strongest propensity to the established church, and
frequently inculcated a maxim, which, tho' it has some
foundation, is to be received with great limitations,
No BISHOP, No KING. The bishops, in their turn,
were very liberal of their praises towards the royal dis∣putant;
and the Archbishop of Canterbury said, that
<HI>undoubtedly his Majesty spoke by the special assistance of
God's spirit</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 665.</NOTE>. A few alterations in the liturgy were
agreed to, and both parties separated with mutual dissa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="588"/>
IT had frequently been the practice of puritanical
clergymen to form together certain assemblies, which
they called <HI>prophesyings;</HI> where alternately, as moved
by the spirit, they displayed their pious zeal in prayers
and exhortations, and raised their own enthusiasm, as
well as that of their audience, to the highest pitch, from
that social contagion, which has so mighty an influence
on holy servours, and from the mutual emulation,
which arose in those trials of religious eloquence. Such
dangerous societies had been suppressed by Elizabeth;
and the ministers in this conference moved the King
for their revival. But James sharply replied, <HI>If you aim
at a</HI> Scottish <HI>presbytery, it agrees as well with monarchy
as God and the devil. There</HI> Jack <HI>and</HI> Tom <HI>and</HI> Will <HI>and</HI>
Dick <HI>shall meet and censure me and my council. Therefore
I reiterate my former speech:</HI> Le Roi s'avisera. <HI>Stay, I
pray for one seven years before you demand; and then, if
you find me grow pursie and fat, I may perchance hearken
unto you. For that government will keep me in breath, and
give me work enough</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Ecclesiast. History.</NOTE>. Such were the political conside∣rations,
which determined the King in his choice among
religious parties.</P>
<P>THE next assembly, in which James displayed his
learning and eloquence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> was one that showed some more
spirit of liberty than appeared among his bishops and
theologians. The parliament was now ready to assem∣ble;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March

which had broke out in London. and raged to such a
degree, that 30,000 persons are computed to have died
of it in a year; tho' the City contained at that time
only about 150,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE speech, which the King made on opening the
parliament, displays fully his character, and proves him
to have possessed more knowlege and greater parts
<PB N="524" REF="589"/>
than prudence or any just sense of decorum and pro∣priety<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 484, 485, &amp;c. Journ. 22d March 1603. Kennet, p. 668.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIV.</NOTE>
Tho' few productions of the age surpass this
speech either in style or matter; it wants that majesti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
brevity and reserve, which becomes a king in his ad∣dresses
to the great council of the nation. It contains,
however, a very remarkable stroke of candor, where
he confesses his too great facility in yielding to the solli∣citations
of suitors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 495, 496.</NOTE>. A fault, which he promises to
correct, but which adhered to him, and distressed him,
during the whole course of his reign.</P>
<P>THE first business, in which the commons were en∣gaged,
was of the utmost importance to the preservation
of their privileges; and neither temper nor resolution
were wanting in their conduct of it.</P>
<P>IN former periods of the English government, the
house of commons were of so small weight in the bal∣ance
of the constitution, that little attention had been
given, either by the crown, the people, or the house
itself, to the choice and continuance of the members.
It had been usual, after parliaments were prolonged
beyond one session, for the chancellor to exert a discre∣tionary
authority, of issuing new writs to supply the
place of any members, whom he judged incapable
of attending, either on account of their employment,
their sickness, or other impediment. This practice
gave that minister, and consequently the prince, an un∣limited
power of garbling at pleasure the representatives
of the nation; yet so little jealousy had it created, that
the commons of themselves, without an, court influ∣ence
or intrigue, and contrary to some former votes
of their own, confirmed it in the twenty third of Eliza∣beth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ, January 19, 1580.</NOTE>. At that time, tho' some members, whose
place had been supplied on account of sickness, having
<PB N="525" REF="590"/>
now recovered their health, appeared in the house, and
claimed their seat; such was the authority of the chan∣cellor,
that merely out of respect to him, his sentence
was adhered to, and the new members were continued
in their places. Here a most dangerous prerogative
was conferred on the crown: But to show the genius
of that age, or rather the channels in which power
then ran, the crown put very little value on this autho∣rity;
insomuch, that two days afterwards, the chancel∣lor,
of himself, resigned it back to the commons, and
and gave them power to judge of a particular vacancy
in their house. And when the question, concerning the
chancellor's new writs, was again brought on the carpet
towards the end of the session, the commons were so lit∣tle
terrified at the precedent, that, tho' they re-admitted
some old members, whose seats had been vacated, on
account of slight indispositions, yet they confirmed the
chancellor's sentence, in instances where the distemper
appeared dangerous and incurable<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Journ. March 18, 1580. See farther D'Ewes, p. 430.</NOTE>. Nor did they pro∣ceed
any farther, in vindication of their privileges, than
to vote, <HI>that during the sitting of parliament there do not,
at any time, any writ go out for the choosing or returning
any member without the warrant of the house.</HI> In Eliza∣beth's
reign we may remark, and the reigns pre∣ceding,
sessions of parliament usually continued not
above the twelfth part so long as the vacations: and dur∣ing
the latter, the chancellor's power, if he pleased to
exert it, was still left, by this vote, as unlimited and
unrestrained as ever.</P>
<P>IN a subsequent parliament, the absolute authority
of the Queen was exerted in a manner still more open;
and began for the first time to give alarm to the com∣mons.
New writs having been issued by the chan∣cellor,
when there was no vacancy, and a controversy
<PB N="526" REF="591"/>
arising upon that incident;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLV.</NOTE> the Queen sent a message
to the house, informing them, that it was impertinent
for them to deal in such matters. These questions,
she said, belonged only to the chancellor; and she had
appointed him to confer with the judges, in order to
settle all disputes with regard to elections. The com∣mons
had the courage, a few days after, to vote, “That
it was a most perilous precedent, where two knights
of a county were duly elected, if any new writ
should issue out for a second election, without order
of the house itself; that the discussing and adjudging
of this and such like differences belonged only to
the house; and that there should be no message sent
to the Lord chancellor, not so much as to enquire
what he had done in the matter, because it was con∣ceived
to be a matter derogatory to the power and
privilege of the house<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 397.</NOTE>.” This is the most con∣siderable,
and almost only instance of parliamentary
liberty, which occurs, during the reign of that
Princess.</P>
<P>OUTLAWS, whether on account of debts or crimes,
had been declared by the judges<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">39 H. vi.</NOTE>, incapable of a seat
in the house, where they must themselves be law∣givers:
But this opinion of the judges had been fre∣quently
over-ruled. I find, however, in the case of
Vaughan<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Journ. Feb. 8, 1580.</NOTE>, who was questioned for an outlawry,
that, having proved all his debts to have been contracted
for suretiship, and to have been, most of them, honest∣ly
compounded, he was allowed, on account of these
favourable circumstances, still to keep his seat: Which
plainly supposes, that, otherwise, it would have been
vacated, on account of the outlawry<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">In a subsequent Parliament that of the 35th of the Queen, the Com∣mons, after great debate, expresly voted, that a person out-lawed might be elected. D'Ewes, p. 518. But as the matter had been much contested, the King might think the vote of the House no law, and might esteem his own decision of more weight than theirs. We may also suppose, that he was not acquainted with this vote. Queen Elizabeth in her speech to her last Parliament complained of their admitting outlaws, and represents that conduct of the House as a great abuse.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="592"/>
WHEN James summoned this parliament, he issued
a proclamation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jan. 11, 1604. Rymer, Tom. XVI. p. 561.</NOTE>; in which among many general ad∣vices,
which, like a kind tutor, he bestowed on his
people, he strictly charges them not to chuse any out∣law
for their representative. And he adds; <HI>If any per∣son
take upon him the place of knight, citizen, or burgess,
not being duly elected, according to the laws and statutes in
that behalf provided, and according to the purport, effect,
and true meaning of this our proclamation, then every
person so offending to be fined or imprisoned for the same.</HI>
A proclamation here was plainly put on the same foot∣ing
with a law, and that in so delicate a point as the
right of elections: Most alarming circumstances, had
there not been reason to believe, that this measure,
being entered into so early in the King's reign, pro∣ceeded
more from precipitation and mistake, than from
any serious design of invading the privileges of his
parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The duke of Sully tells us, that it was a maxim of James, that no Prince in the first year of his reign should begin any considerable undertaking. A maxim very reasonable in itself, and very suitable to his cautious, if not timid character. The facility, with which he departed from this preten∣sion is another proof, that his meaning was innocent. But had the privileges of Parliament been at that time exactly ascertained, or royal power fully limited, could such an imagination ever have been entertained by him, as to think, that his proclamations could regulate parliamentary elec∣tions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the
county of Bucks; and his return, as usual, was made
into chancery. The chancellor, pronouncing him
an outlaw, vacated his seat, and issued writs for a new
election<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 18, 19.</NOTE>. Sir John Fortiscue was chosen in his place
<PB N="528" REF="593"/>
by the county: But the first act of the house was to
reverse the chancellor's sentence, and restore Sir Fran∣cis
to his seat. At the King's instigation, the lords
desired a conference on this subject; but were absolutely
refused by the commons, as the question regarded en∣tirely
their own privileges<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26th March, 1604.</NOTE>. They agreed, however,
to make a remonstrance to the King by the mouth
of their speaker; where they maintained, that, tho' the
returns were by form made into chancery, yet the sole
right of judging with regard to elections belonged to
the house itself, not to the chancellor<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Journ 3d April. 1604.</NOTE>. James was
not satisfied, and ordered a conference between the
house and the judges, whose opinion in this case was
opposite to that of the commons. This conference,
he said, he commanded as an <HI>absolute</HI> king<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sir Charles Cornwallis the King's ambassador at Madrid, when pressed by the Duke of Lerma to enter into a league with Spain, said to that minister; <HI>Tho' his Majesty was an</HI> absolute <HI>king, and therefore not bound to give an account to any, of his actions; yet that so gracious and regardful a prince he was of the love and contentment of his own subjects, as I assured myself he would not think it fit to do any thing of so great consequence without acquainting them with his intentions.</HI> Winwood, Vol. 2. p. 222. Sir Walter Raleigh has this passage in the preface to his history of the world. <HI>Philip</HI> II. <HI>by strong hand and main force, attempted to make himself not only an</HI> absolute monarch <HI>over the Netherlands, like unto the kings and monarchs of England and France, but, Turk like, to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws, privileges and ancient rights.</HI> We may infer from these passages, either that the word <HI>absolute</HI> bore a different sense from what it does at present, or that men's ideas of the English government were then different. This latter inference seems juster. The word being derived from the French, bore always the same sense as in that language. An absolute monarchy in Charles I's answer to the nineteen propositions is opposed to a limited: and the King of England is acknowleged not to be absolute. So much had matters changed even before the civil war. In Sir John Fortescue's treatise of absolute and limited monarchy, a book wrote in the reign of Edward the IVth, the word <HI>absolute</HI> is taken in the same sense as at present; and the government of England is said not to be absolute. They were the princes of the house of Tudor chiefly, who introduced that administration, which had the appearance of absolute government. The princes before them were restrained by the barons; as those after them by the House of Commons. The people had, properly speaking, little liberty in either of these antient governments, but the least, in the more antient.</NOTE>; an epithet
<PB N="529" REF="594"/>
we are apt to imagine, not very grateful to English
ears, but one to which they had already been some∣what
accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden in Kennet, p. 375.</NOTE>. He
added, <HI>That all their privileges were derived from his
grant, and hoped they would not turn them against him</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Journ. 29 March. 5 April 1604.</NOTE>,
a sentiment, which, from her conduct, it is certain,
that Princess had also entertained, and which was the
reigning principle of her courtiers and ministers, and
the spring of all her administration.</P>
<P><HI>THE commons were in some perplexity. Their
eyes were now opened, and they saw the consequences
of that power, which had been assumed by the chan∣cellor,
and to which their predecessors had, in some
instances, blindly submitted.</HI> By this course, <HI>said a
member,</HI> the free election of the counties is taken away,
and none shall be chosen but such as shall please the King
and council. Let us, therefore, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortitude, under∣standing,
and sincerity, seek to maintain our privilege. This
cannot be construed any contempt in us, but merely a main∣tenance
of our common rights, which our ancestors have
left us, and which it is just and fit for us to transmit to our
posterity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Journ. 30 March 1604.</NOTE>. <HI>Another said</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>, This may be called a <HI>quo

a third,</HI> by this course may call a parliament consisting of
what persons he pleases. Any suggestion, by any person,
may be the cause of sending a new writ. It is come to
this plain question, whether the chancery or parliament ought
to have authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this watchful spirit of liberty,
which now appeared in the commons, their deference
for majesty was so great, that they appointed a com∣mittee
<PB N="530" REF="595"/>
to confer with the judges before the King and
council. There the question of law began to appear,
in James's eyes, a little more doubtful than he had
hitherto imagined it; and in order to bring himself
off with some honour, he proposed, that both Good∣win
and Fortescue should be set aside, and a writ be
issued, by warrant of the house, for a new election.
Goodwin gave his consent; and the commons em∣braced
this expedient; but in such a manner, that,
while they showed their regard for the King, they se∣cured
for the future, the free possession of their seats,
and the right, which they claimed, of judging solely in
their own elections and returns<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Even this Parliament, which shewd so much spirit and good-sense in the affair of Goodwin, made a strange concession to the crown, in their fourth session. Toby Mathews, a member, had been banished by order of council upon direction from his Majesty. The Parliament not only acquiesced in this arbitrary proceeding, but issued writs for a new election. Such novices were they, as yet in the principles of Liberty! See Journ. 14 Feb. 1609. Mathews was banished by the King, on account of his change of religion to popery. The King had an indulgence to those who had been educated catholics: but could not bear the new converts. It was probably the ani∣mosity of the Commons against the papists, which made them acquiesce in this precedent, without reflecting on the consequences! The jealousy of Liberty, tho' rouzed, was not yet thoroughly enlightened.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A POWER like this, so essential to the exercise of all
their other powers, themselves so essential to public
liberty, cannot fairly be deemed an encroachment in
the commons; but must be regarded as an inherent
privilege, happily rescued from that ambiguity, which
the negligence of some former parliaments had thrown
upon it.</P>
<P>AT the same time, the commons, in the case of
Sir Thomas Shirley, established their power of pun∣ishing,
as well the persons at whose suit any member
is arrested, as the officers, who either arrest or detain
him. Their asserting of this privilege admits of the
same reflection<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Journ. 6, and 7, May, 1604.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="531" REF="596"/>
ABOUT this period, the minds of men, throughout
all Europe, but especially in England, seem to have
undergone a general, but insensible revolution. Tho'
letters had been revived in the preceding age, they seem
to have been chiefly cultivated by men of sedentary
professions; nor had they, till now, begun to spread
themselves, in any degree, among men of the world.
Arts, both mechancical and liberal, were every day
receiving great improvements. Navigation had ex∣tended
itself over the whole globe. Travelling was
secure and agreeable. And the general system of pro∣litics,
in Europe, was become more enlarged and com∣prehensive.</P>
<P>IN
consequence of this universal fermentation, the
ideas of men enlarged themselves on all sides, and the
several constituent parts of the gothic governments,
which seem to have lain asleep for so many ages, began,
every where, to operate and encroach on each other.
On the continent, where the necessity of discipline had
begot mercenary armies, the prince commonly establish∣ed
an unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or
intrigue, the liberties of the people. In England, the
love of freedom, which, unless checked, flourishes ex∣tremely
in all liberal natures, acquired new force, and
was regulated by more enlarged views, suitable to that
cultivated understanding, which became, every day,
more common, among men of birth and education.
A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of
antiquity excited in every generous breast a passion for
a limited constitution, and begot an emulation of
those manly virtues, which the Greek and Roman
authors, by such animating examples, as well as pathetic
expressions, recommend to us. The severe, tho' po∣pular,
government of Elizaberth had confined this ri∣sing
spirit within very narrow bounds: But when a
<PB N="532" REF="597"/>
new and a foreign family succeeded to the throne, and
a prince less dreaded and less beloved; symptoms im∣mediately
appeared of a more free and independent
genius in the nation.</P>
<P>HAPPILY this Prince possessed neither sufficient ca∣pacity
to perceive the alteration, nor sufficient art and
vigour to check it in its early advances. Jealous of
regal, because conscious of little personal authority,
he had established within his own mind a speculative
system of absolute government, which few of his sub∣jects,
he believed, and none but traito<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and rebels,
would make any scruple to admit. On which-ever side
he cast his eyes, every thing concurred to encourage
his prejudices. When he compared himself with the
other hereditary sovereigns of Europe, he imagined,
that, as he bore the same rank, he was intitled to equal
prerogatives; not considering the innovations lately
introduced by them, and the military force, by which
their authority was supported. In England, that power,
almost unlimited, which had been exercised for above
a century, especially during the late reign, he ascribed
solely to royal birth and title; not to the prudence
and spirit of the monarchs, nor to the conjunctures
of the times. Even the opposition, which he had
struggled with in Scotland, encouraged him still far∣ther
in his favourite notions; while he there saw,
that the same resistance, which opposed regal authority,
violated all law and order, and made way, either for
the ravages of a barbarous nobility, or for the more
intolerable insolence of seditious preachers. In his
own person, therefore, he thought all legal power to
be centered, by an hereditary and a divine right: And
this opinion might have proved dangerous, if not fatal,
to liberty; had not the firmness of the persuasion, and
its seeming evidence induced him to trust solely to his
<PB N="533" REF="598"/>
right, without making the smallest provision either of
force or politics, in order to support it.</P>
<P>SUCH were the opposite dispositions of parliament
and prince, at the commencement of the Scottish
line; dispositions just beginning to exist and to appear
in the parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">At that time, men of genius and of enlarg'd minds had adopted the principles of liberty, which were, as yet, pretty much unknown to the generality of the people. Sir Matthew Hales had publish'd a remonstrance against the King's conduct towards the Parliament during this session. The remonstrance is drawn with great force of reasoning and spirit of liberty; and was the production of Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Edwin Sandys, two men of the greatest parts and knowledge in England. It is drawn in the name of the Parliament; but as there is no hint of it in the journals, we must conclude, either that the authors, sensible that the strain of the piece was much beyond the principles of the age, had not ventur'd to present it to the house, or that it had been, for that reason, rejected by them. The dignity and authority of the commons are strongly insisted upon in this re∣monstrance; and it is there said, that their submission to the ill treatment, which they rec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign, had pro∣ceeded from their tenderness towards her age and her sex. But the authors are mistaken in these facts: For the house received and submitted to as bad treatment in the beginning and middle of that reign. The government was equally arbitrary in Mary's reign, in Edward's, in Harry the eighth and seventh's. And the farther we go back in history, tho' there might be more of a certain irregular kind of liberty among the barons, the commons were still of less authority. King James, as they themselves acknowleg'd, gave the house of commons more liberty of speech, than had been indulg'd them by any of his predecessors.</NOTE>, but thoroughly established and
openly avowed on the part of the prince.</P>
<P>THE spirit and judgment of the house of commons
appeared, not only in defence of their own privileges,
but also in their endeavour, tho', at this time, in vain,
to free trade from those shackles, which the high exerted
prerogative, and even, in this respect, the ill-judged
tyranny of Elizabeth, had imposed upon it.</P>
<P>JAMES had already, of his own accord, called in
and annulled all the numerous patents for monopolies,
which had been granted by his predecessor, and which
<PB N="534" REF="599"/>
fettered extremely every species of domestic industry:
But the exclusive companies still remained; another
species of monopoly, by which almost all foreign trade,
except that to France, was brought into the hands of
a few rapacious engrossers, and all prospect of future
improvement in commerce was for ever sacrificed to a
little temporary advantage of the sovereign. These
companies, tho' arbitrarily erected, had carried their
privileges so far, that the whole commerce of Eng∣land
was centered in London; and it appears, that the
customs of that port amounted to 110,000l. a-year,
while those of all the kingdom beside yielded only
seventeen thousand<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 21 May, 1604.</NOTE>. Nay, the whole trade of London
was confined to about 200 citizens<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>, who were easily
enabled, by combining among themselves, to fix what∣ever
price they pleased both to the exports and imports
of the nation. The committee, appointed to examine
this enormous grievance, one of the greatest which we
read of in English story, insist on it as a fact well
known and avowed, however contrary to the present
received opinion, that shipping and seamen had sensibly
decayed during all the preceding reign<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">A remonstrance from the Trinity-house, in 1602, says, that in a little above twelve years, after 1588, the shipping and number of seamen in England decayed about a third part. Anglesey's happy future state of England, p. 128. from Sir Julius Caesar's collections. See Journ. 21 May 1604.</NOTE>. And tho'
nothing be more common than complaints of the det
cay of commerce, even during the most flourishing pe∣riods;
yet is this a consequence which might naturally
result from such arbitrary establishments, at a time
when the trade of all the other nations of Europe,
except that of Scotland, enjoyed full liberty and in∣dulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="600"/>
WHILE the commons were thus attempting to give
liberty to the trading part of the nation, they also en∣deavoured
to free the landed interest from the burthen
of wardships<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1 June, 1604.</NOTE>, and to remove those remains of the
seudal tenures, under which the nation still laboured.
A just regard was shown to the crown in the whole
conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy, sought
for, considered as a matter of right, but merely of grace
and favour. The profit, which the King reaped both
from wards and from respite of homage, was estimated;
and it was proposed to compound for these preroga∣tives
by a secure and independent revenue. But after
some debates in the house, and some conferences with
the lords, the affair was found to contain more difficul∣ties
than could easily, at that time, be surmounted;
and it was not then brought to any conclusion.</P>
<P>THE same fate attended an attempt of a like nature,
to free the nation from the burthen of purveyance; an
old prerogative in the crown, by which the officers of
the houshold were empowered to take, without consent
of the owners, provisions for the King's family, and
carts and horses for the removal of his baggage, upon
paying a stated price for them. This prerogative had
been much abused by the purveyors<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Journ. 30 April, 1604.</NOTE>; and the com∣mons
shewed some intention to offer the King fifty
thousand pounds a-year for the abolition of it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER affair of the utmost consequence was
brought before this parliament, where the commons
shewed a greater spirit of independence than any true
judgment of national interest. The union of the two
kingdoms was very zealously, and even impatiently
urged by the King<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Journ. 21 April. 1 May, 1604. Parliamentary History, Vol. 5. p. 91.</NOTE>. He justly regarded it as the
peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated
<PB N="536" REF="601"/>
the bloody animosities of these hostile nations, and
had reduced the whole island under one empire; en∣joying
tranquillity within itself, and security from all
foreign invasions. He hoped, that, while his subjects
of both kingdoms reflected on past disasters, besides
regarding his person as infinitely precious, they would
entertain the strongest desire of securing themselves
against the return of like calamities, by a thorough
union of laws, parliaments, and privileges. He consi∣dered
not, that this very reflection operated, as yet,
in a contrary manner, on men's prejudices, and kept
alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which
had been carried to the greatest extremity, and required
time to allay it. The more urgent the King appeared
in promoting so useful a measure, the more backward
was the English parliament in concurring with him;
while they ascribed his excessive zeal, to that partiality,
in favour of his antient subjects, of which they thought,
that, on other occasions, they had reason to complain.
Their complaisance for the King, therefore, carried
them no farther than to appoint forty-four English to
meet with thirty-one Scots commissioners, in order to
deliberate concerning the terms of an union; but
without any power of making advances towards the
establishment of it<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Journ. 7 June, 1604. Kennet, p. 673.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same spirit of independence, and perhaps not
better judgment, appeared in the house of commons,
when the question of supply was brought before them,
by some members who were attached to the court.
In vain was it urged, that, tho' the King received a
supply, which had been voted to Elizabeth, and which
had not been collected before her death; yet he found
it burthened with a debt contracted by the Queen,
equal to the full amount of it: That peace was not
<PB N="537" REF="602"/>
yet thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland
was still expensive to him: That on his journey from
Scotland, amidst such an immense concourse of people,
and on that of the Queen and royal family, he had
expended considerable sums: And that, as the courtiers
had looked for greater liberalities from the Prince on his
accession, and had imposed on his generous nature;
so the Prince, in his turn, would expect, at the begin∣ning,
some mark of duty and attachment from his peo∣ple
and some consideration of his necessities. No impres∣sion
was made on the house of commons by these to∣pics;
and the majority appeared fully determined to
refuse all supply. The burthen of the government,
at that time, lay surprisingly light upon the people:
And that very reason, which to us, at this distance,
may seem a motive for generosity, was the real cause
why the parliament was, on all occasions, so remark∣ably
frugal and reserved. They were not, as yet, ac∣customed
to open their purses in so liberal a manner as
their successors, in order to supply the wants of their
sovereign; and the smallest demand, however requisite,
appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant.
The commons seem also to have been desirous of re∣ducing
the crown to still farther necessities, by their
refusing a bill, sent down to them by the lords, for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntailing the crown lands for ever on the King's hei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
and succesors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hist. Vol. 5. p. 108.</NOTE>. The dissipation, made by Elizabeth,
had probably taught him the necessity of this law,
and shewn them the advantage of refusing it.</P>
<P>IN order to cover a disappointment, which might
bear a bad construction both at home and abroad,
James sent a message to the house<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 June 1604.</NOTE>, where he told
them, that he desired no supply; and he was very
<PB N="538" REF="603"/>
forward in refusing what was never offered him. Soon
after, he prorogued the parliament, not without dis∣covering,
in his speech, visible marks of dissatisfaction.
Even so early in his reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of July.</NOTE> he saw reason to make pub∣lic
complaints of the restless and encroaching spirit of
the puritanical party, and of the malevolence, with
which they endeavoured to inspire the commons. Nor
were his apprehensions without reason; since the com∣mons,
now finding themselves free from the arbitrary
government of Elizabeth, apply'd for a conference with
the lords, and presented a petition to the King; the
purport of both which was to procure, in favour of the
puritans, a relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws.
The use of the surplice and of the cross in baptism is
there chiefly complained of; but the remedy seems to
be expected solely from the King's dispensing power<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary history, vol. 5. p. 98, 99, 100.</NOTE>.
The same papers discover the violent animosity of the
commons against the catholics together with the into∣lerating
spirit of that assembly.</P>
<P>THIS summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Spain. 18th August.</NOTE> the peace with Spain was finally con∣cluded,
and was signed by the Spanish ministers at Lon∣don<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer tom. XVI. p. 585. &amp;c.</NOTE>. In the conferences, previous to this treaty,
the nations were found to have so few claims on each
other, that, except on account of the support given by
England to the Low country provinces, the war might
appear to have been continued more on account of per∣sonal
animosity between Philip and Elizabeth, than
any contrariety of political interests between their sub∣jects.
Some articles in the treaty, which seem pre∣judicial
to the Dutch commonwealth, were never exe∣cuted
by the King; and as the Spaniards made no com∣plaints
on that head, it appeared, that, by secret agree∣ment,
these articles were understood in a different
sense from what they seem naturally to bear, and that
<PB N="539" REF="604"/>
the King reserved the power of sending assistance to
the Hollanders<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 27. p. 330, <HI>et alibi.</HI> In this respect James's peace was more honourable than that which Henry the 4th himself made with Spain. That prince stipulated not to assist the Dutch; and the supplies, which he secretly sent them were in direct contravention to the treaty.</NOTE>. The Constable of Castile came into
England to ratify the peace; and on the part of Eng∣land,
the Earl of Hartford was sent into the Low
Countries for the same purpose, and the Earl of Not∣tingham,
Lord high admiral, into Spain. The train
of the latter was numerous and splendid; and the
Spaniards, it is said, were extremely surprised, when
they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful
appearance of the English, whom their bigotry, in∣flamed
by the priests, had represented as so many mon∣sters
and infernal dem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s.</P>
<P>THO' England, by means of her naval force, was
perfectly secure, during the latter years of the Spanish
war, James shewed an extreme impatience to put an
end to hostilities; and soon after his accession, before
any terms of peace were concerted or even proposed
by Spain, he recalled all the letters of marque<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">23d of June, 1603.</NOTE>, which
had been granted by Queen Elizabeth. The Arch∣duke
Albert had made some advances of a like nature<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Grotii Annal. Lib. 12.</NOTE>,
which invited the King to take this friendly step. But
what is remarkable; in James's proclamation for that
purpose, he plainly supposes, that, as he had himself,
while king of Scotland, always lived in amity with
Spain, peace was attached to his person, and that mere∣ly
by his accession to the crown of England, without
any articles of treaty or agreement, he had ended the
war between the kingdoms<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See procla∣mations during the first seven years of K. James. Winwood vol. II. p. 65.</NOTE>. This ignorance of the

law of nations may appear surprising in a Prince, who
was thirty-six years of age, and who had reigned from
his infancy, did we not consider, that a king of Scot∣land,
who lives in close friendship with England, has
few transactions to manage with foreign princes, and
has little opportunity of acquiring experience. Un∣happily
for James, his timidity, his prejudices, his in∣dolence,
his love of amusement, particularly of hunt∣ing,
to which he was extremely addicted, ever prevent∣ed
him from making any progress in the knowledge or
practice of foreign politics, and in a little time dimi∣nished
that regard, which all the neighbouring na∣tions
had paid to England, during the reign of his
predecessor.</P>

of the strength and weakness of the human mind;

treason</HI> of which I speak; a fact as certain as it ap∣pears
incredible.</P>
<P>THE Roman catholics had expected great favour and
indulgence on the accession of James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gun-Powder conspiracy.</NOTE> both as he was
descended from Mary, who had sacrificed her life to their
cause, and as he himself, in his early youth, was be∣lieved
to have shown some partiality towards them;
which nothing, they thought, but interest and necessity
had since restrained. 'Tis pretended, that he had even
entered into positive engagements to tolerate their re∣ligion,
so soon as he should mount the throne of Eng∣land;
whether their credulity had interpreted in this
sense some obliging expressions of the King, or that he
had employed such an artifice, in order to render them
favourable to his title<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. II. p. 201, 202, 203. Winwood vol. II. p. 49.</NOTE>. Very soon they discovered
their mistake; and were at once surprised and enraged
to find James, on all occasions, express his intention
of executing strictly the laws enacted against them,
and of persevering in all the rigorous measures of Eli∣zabeth.
<PB N="542" REF="609"/>
Catesby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1605.</NOTE> a gentleman of good parts and of
an antient family, first thought of a most extraordinary
method of revenge; and he opened his intention to
Piercy, a descendant of the illustrious house of Nor∣thumberland.
In one of their conversations with re∣gard
to the distrest condition of the catholics, Piercy
having broke into a sally of passion, and mentioned
the assassinating the King; Catesby took the opportu∣nity
of revealing to him a nobler and more extensive
plan of treason, which not only included a sure exe∣cution
of vengeance, but afforded some hopes of re∣storing
the catholic religion in England. In vain,
said he, would you put an end to the King's life: He
has children, who would succeed both to his crown and
to his maxims of government. In vain would you ex∣tinguish
the whole royal family: The nobility, the
gentry, the parliament are all infected with the same
heresy, and could raise to the throne another prince
and another family, who, besides their hatred to our
religion, would be animated with revenge for the tra∣gical
death of their predecessors. To serve any good
purpose, we must destroy, at one blow, the King,
the royal family, the lords, the commons; and bury
all our enemies in one common ruin. Happily, they
are all assembled on the first meeting of the Parliament;
and afford us the opportunity of glorious and useful
vengeance. Great preparations will not be requisite.
A few of us, combining, may run a mine below the
hall, in which they meet, and choosing the very mo∣ment
when the King harangues both houses, consign
over to destruction these determined foes to all piety
and religion. Mean while, we ourselves standing
aloof, safe and unsuspected, shall triumph in being the
instruments of divine wrath, and shall behold with
pleasure those sacrilegious walls, in which were
past the edicts for proscribing our church and butcher∣ing
<PB N="543" REF="610"/>
her children, tost into a thousand fragments; while
their impious inhabitants, meditating perhaps still new
prosecutions against us, pass from flames above to
flames below, there for ever to endure the torments due
to their offences<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">History of the Gunpowder Treason.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PIERCY was charmed with this project of Catesby;
and they agreed to communicate the matter to a few
more, and among the rest to Thomas Winter, whom
they sent over to Flanders, in quest of Fawkes, an
officer in the Spanish service, with whose zeal and
courage they were all thoroughly acquainted. When
they inlisted any new conspirator, in order to bind
him to secrecy, they always, together with an oath,
employed the sacrament, the most sacred rite of their
religion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 190, 198, 210.</NOTE>. And 'tis remarkable, that no one of these
pious devotees ever entertained the least compunction
with regard to the cruel massacre, which they project∣ed,
of whatever was great and eminent in the nation.
Some of them only were startled by the reflection,
that of necessity many catholics must be present; as
spectators or attendants on the King, or as having
seats in the house of peers: But Tesmond, a jesuit,
and Garnet, superior of that order in England, removed
these scruples, and shewed them how the interests of
religion required, that the innocent should here be sa∣crificed
with the guilty.</P>
<P>ALL this passed in the spring and summer of the
year 1604; when the conspirators also hired a house in
Piercy's name, adjoining to that in which the par∣liament
was to assemble. Towards the end of that
year they began their operations. That they might
be less interrupted, and give less suspicion to the neigh∣bourhood,
they carried in store of provisions with them,
<PB N="544" REF="611"/>
and never desisted from their labour. Obstinate to
their purpose, and confirmed by passion, by principle
and by mutual exhortation, they little feared death in
comparison of a disappointment; and having provided
arms, together with the instruments of their labour,
they resolved there to perish in case of a discovery.
Their perseverance advanced the work; and they soon
pierced the wall, tho' three yards in thickness; but
on approaching the other side, they were some∣what
startled with hearing a noise, which they knew
not how to account for. Upon inquiry, they found,
that it came from the vault below the house of lords;
that a magazine of coals had been kept there; and
that, as the coals were selling off, the vault would
be let to the highest bidder. The opportunity was
immediately seized; the place hired by Piercy; thirty-six
barrels of powder lodged in it; the whole covered
up with faggots and billets; the doors of the cellar
boldly flung open; and every body admitted, as if it
contained nothing dangerous.</P>
<P>CONFIDENT of success, they now began to look for∣ward,
and to plan the remaining part of their project.
The King, the Queen, Prince Henry, were all expected
to be present at the opening of the parliament. The
Duke, by reason of his tender age, would be absent;
and it was resolved, that Piercy should seize him, or
assassinate him. The Princess Elizabeth, a child like∣wise,
was kept at Lord Harrington's house in Warwick∣shire;
and Sir Everard Digby, Rookwood, Grant,
being let into the conspiracy, engaged to assemble their
friends, on pretence of a hunting-match, and seizing
that Princess, immediately to proclaim her Queen. So
transported were they with rage against their adver∣saries,
and so charmed with the prospect of revenge,
that they forgot all care of their own safety; and trust∣ing
to the general confusion, which must result from
<PB N="545" REF="612" MS="y"/>
so unexpected a blow, they foresaw not, that the fury
of the people, now unrestrained by any authority, must
have turned against them, and would probably have sa∣tiated
itself, by an universal massacre of the catho∣lics.</P>
<P>THE day, so long wished for, now approached, on
which the parliament was appointed to assemble. The
dreadful secret, tho' communicated to above twenty
persons, had been religiously kept, during the space
of near a year and a half. No remorse, no pity, no
fear of punishment, no hope of reward, had, as yet,
induced any one conspirator, either to abandon the
enterprize, or make a discovery of it. The holy fury
had extinguished in their breast every other motive;
and it was an indiscretion at last, proceeding chiefly
from these very bigotted prejudices and partialities,
which saved the nation.</P>
<P><HI>TEN days before the meeting of the parliament,
Lord Monteagle, a catholic, son to Lord Morley,
received the following letter, which had been delivered
to his servant by an unknown hand.</HI> My Lord, Out
of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a care of
your preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you
tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift off your at∣tendance
at this parliament. For God and man have con∣curred
to punish the wickedness of this time. And think
not slightly of this advertisement; but retire yourself into
your country, where you may expect the event in safety.
For, tho' there be no appearance of any stir, yet, I say, they
will receive a terrible blow, this parliament, and yet they
shall not see who hurts them▪ This counsel is not to be
contemned, because it may do you good, and can do you no
harm: For the danger is past, as soon as you have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned
the letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make
<PB N="546" REF="613"/>
good use of it, to whose holy protection I commend
you<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">K. Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Works, p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONTEAGLE knew not what to make of this letter;
and tho' inclined to think it a foolish attempt to fright∣en
and ridicule him, he judged it safest to carry it to
Lord Salisbury, secretary of state. Tho' Salisbury too
was inclined to give little attention to it, he thought
proper to lay it before the King who came to town a
few days after. To the King it appeared not so light
a matter; and from the serious earnest style of the let∣ter,
he conjectured, that it implied something very
dangerous and important. A <HI>terrible blow,</HI> and yet <HI>the
authors concealed;</HI> a danger so <HI>sudden,</HI> and yet so <HI>great;</HI>
these circumstances seemed all to denote some contri∣vance
by gun-powder; and it was thought advisable
to inspect all the vaults below the houses of parliament.
This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, Lord cham∣berlain;
who purposely delayed the search, till the day
before the meeting of the parliament. He remarked
those great piles of wood and faggots, which lay in
the vault under the upper house; and he cast his eye
upon Fawkes, who stood in a dark corner, and passed
himself for Piercy's servant. That daring and deter∣mined
courage, which so much distinguished this con∣spirator,
even among those heroes in villany, was fully
painted in his countenance, and was not passed unnoti∣ced
by the Lord chamberlain<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 229.</NOTE>. Such a quantity also
of fuel, for the use of one who lived so little in town
as Piercy, appeared a little extraordinary<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>; and upon
comparing all circumstances it was resolved that a more
thorow inspection should be made. About midnight,
Sir Thomas Knevet, a justice of peace, was sent with
proper attendants; and before the door of the vault,
<PB N="547" REF="614"/>
finding Fawkes, who had just finished all his prepa∣rations,
he immediately seized him, and turning over
the faggots, discovered the powder. The matches and
every thing proper for setting fire to the train were
taken in Fawkes's pocket; who finding his guilt now
apparent, and seeing no refuge but in boldness and
despair, expressed the utmost regret, that he had lost
the opportunity, of firing the powder at once, and of
sweetening his own death by that of his enemies<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 230.</NOTE>.
Before the council, he displayed the same intrepid
firmness, mixt even with scorn and disdain; refusing
to discover his accomplices and shewing no concern
but for the failure of the enterprize<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 173.</NOTE>. This obstinacy
lasted two or three days: But being confined to the
Tower, left to reflect on his guilt and danger, and the
rack being just shown to him; his courage, fatigued
with so long an effort, and unsupported by hope or so∣ciety,
at last failed him; and he made a full disco∣very
of all the conspirators<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 231.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CATESBY, Piercy, and the other criminals, who
were in London, tho' they had heard of the alarm
taken at the letter sent to Monteagle; tho' they had
heard of the lord chamberlain's search; yet were re∣solved
to persist to the utmost, and never abandon their
hopes of success<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Some historians have imagined, that the King had secret intelligence of the conspiracy, and that the letter to Monteagle was wrote by his direction, in order to obtain the fame of penetration in discovering the plot. But the known facts refute this supposition. That letter, being commonly talked of, might naturally have given and alarm to the conspirators, and made them contrive their escape. The visit of the Lord chamberlain ought to have had the same effect. In short, it appears, that no body was arrested or enquired after, for some days, till Fawkes discovered the names of the conspirators. We may infer, however, from a letter in Winwood's Memorials, vol. II. p. 171. that Salisbury's sagacity led the King in his conjectures, and that the minister, like an artful courtier, gave his master the praise of the whole discovery.</NOTE>. But at last, hearing that Fawkes
<PB N="548" REF="615"/>
was arrested, they hurried away to Warwickshire;
where Sir Everard Digby, making account that success
had attended his confederates, was already in arms,
in order to seize the princess Elizabeth. She had
escaped into Coventry; and they were obliged to put
themselves on their defence against the country, who
were raised from all quarters, and armed, by the sheriffs.
The conspirators, with all their attendants never ex∣ceeded
the number of eighty persons; and being sur∣rounded
on every side, could no longer entertain hopes,
either of escaping or prevailing. Having therefore con∣fessed
themselves, and received absolution, they boldly
prepared for death, and resolved to sell their lives as
dear as possible to the assailants. But even this miser∣able
consolation was denied them. Some of their pow∣der
took fire, and disabled them for defence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 199. Discourse of the manner &amp;c. p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. The
people rushed in upon them. Piercy and Catesby was
killed with one shot. Digby, Rookwood, Winter,
and others, being taken prisoners, were tried, confessed
their guilt, and died, as well as Garnet, by the hands
of the executioner. Notwithstanding this horrid crime,
the bigotted catholics were so devoted to Garnet, that
they fancy'd miracles to be wrought by his blood<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Winwood Vol. II. p. 300.</NOTE>;
and in Spain he was regarded as a Martyr<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Winwood Vol. II. p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEITHER had the desperate fortune of the conspi∣rators
urged them to this enterprize, nor had the for∣mer
profligacy of their lives prepared them for so great
a crime. Before that audacious attempt, their conduct
seems, in general, to be liable to no reproach. Ca∣tesby's
character had entitled him to such regard, that
Rookwood and Digby were seduced by their implicit
trust in his judgment; and they declared, that, from
she motive alone of friendship to him, they were ready,
<PB N="549" REF="616"/>
on any occasion, to have sacrificed their lives<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 201.</NOTE>. Digby
himself was as highly esteemed and beloved as any
man in England; and he had been particularly honour∣ed
with the good opinion of Queen Elizabeth<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Athen. Ox. vol. II. fol. 354.</NOTE>. 'Twas
bigotted zeal alone, the most absurd of prejudices
masqued with reason, the most criminal of passions
covered with the appearance of duty, which seduced
them into measures, that were fatal to themselves, and
had so nearly proved fatal to their country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Digby after his condemnation, said in a letter to his wife: “Now for my intention, let me tell you, that if I had thought there had been the least sin in the plot, I would not have been of it for all the world; and no other cause drew me, to hazard my fortune and life but zeal to God's religion.” He expresses his surprize to hear that any catholics had con∣demned it. <HI>Digby's papers, published by secretary Coventry.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Lords Mordaunt and Sturton, two catholics,
were fined, the former 10,000 pounds, the latter
4000, by the star-chamber; because their absence from
parliament had begot a suspicion of their being made
acquainted with the conspiracy. The Earl of Nor∣thumberland
was fined 30,000 pounds, and detained
several years prisoner in the Tower; because, among
other grounds of suspicion, he had admitted Piercy
into the number of gentlemen pensioners, without his
taking the requisite oaths<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden in Kennet, p. 692.</NOTE>. These sentences may be
thought somewhat arbitrary: But such was the nature
of all proceedings in the star-chamber.</P>
<P>THE King, in his speech to the parliament, observ∣ed,
that, tho' religion had engaged the conspirators
in so criminal an attempt, yet ought we not to involve
all the Roman catholics in the same guilt, or suppose
them equally disposed to commit such enormous bar∣barities.
Many holy men, he said, and our ancestors
among the rest, had been seduced to concur with that
church in her scholastic doctrines; who yet had never
<PB N="550" REF="617"/>
admitted her seditious principles, conerning the Pope's
power of dethroning kings, or sanctifying assassination.
The wrath of heaven is denounced against crimes,
but innocent error may obtain its favour; and nothing
can be more hateful than the uncharitableness of the
puritans, who condemn alike to eternal torments,
even the most inoffensive proselytes to popery. For
his part, he added, that conspiracy, however atrocious,
should never alter, in the least, his plan of government:
While with one hand he punished guilt; with the
other, he would still support and protect innocence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">K. James's works, p. 503, 504.</NOTE>.
After this speech, he prorogued the parliament, till the
22d of January<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The Parliament this session passed an act obliging every one to take the oath of allegiance; a very moderate test, since it decided no controverted points between the two religions, and only engaged the person who took it to abjure the Pope's power of de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>roning Kings. See K. James's works, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE moderation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1606.</NOTE> and, I may say, magnanimity,
of the King, immediately after so narrow an escape
from a most detestable conspiracy, was no wise agreea∣ble
to his subjects. Their animosity against popery,
even before this provocation, had risen to a great pitch;
and it had perhaps been more prudent in James, by a
little dissimulation, to have conformed himself to it.
His theological learning, confirmed by disputation, had
happily fixed his judgment in the protestant faith; yet
was his heart a little byassed by the allurements of
Rome, and he had been extremely pleased, if the
making some advances could have effected an union
with that antient mother-church. He strove to abate
the acrimony of his own subjects against the religion
of their fathers: He became himself the object of their
diffidence and aversion. Whatever measures he em∣braced;
in Scotland to introduce prelacy, in England
to inforce the authority of the present church, and
<PB N="551" REF="618"/>
support its rites and ceremonies; were interpreted as
so many steps towards popery, and were represented by
the puritans as symptoms of idolatry and superstition.
Ignorant of the consequences, or unwilling to sacrifice
to politics his inclination, which he called his con∣science,
he persevered in the same measures, and gave
trust and preferment, almost indifferently, to his catho∣lic
and protestant subjects. And finding his person,
as well as his title less obnoxious to the church of
Rome, than those of Elizabeth, he gradually abated
the rigour of those laws, which had been enacted
against that church, and which had been enacted
against that church, and which were so acceptable to
his bigotted subjects. But the effects of these dispositi∣ons
on both sides became not very sensible, till towards
the conclusion of his reign.</P>
<P>AT this time, James seems to have possessed, in some
degree, the affections even of his English subjects, and,
in a pretty high degree, their esteem and regard. Hi∣therto
their complaints were chiefly levelled against his
too great constancy in his early friendships; a quality,
which, had it been attended with more oeconomy, the
wise would have excused, and the candid would even,
perhaps, have applauded. His parts, which were not
despicable, and his learning, which was great, being
highly extolled by his cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers and gownmen, and
not yet tried in the management of any delicate affairs,
for which he was unfit, raised a very high idea of him
in the world; nor was it always thro' flattery or insin∣cerity,
that he received the title of the second Solomon.
A report, which was suddenly spread about this time,
of his being assassinated, visibly struck a great conster∣nation
into all orders of men<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 676.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The commons also
abated, this session, somewhat of their excessive fruga∣lity
and granted him an aid o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three subsidies and six
<PB N="552" REF="619"/>
fifteenths, which, Sir Francis Bacon said in the house<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20 May, 1606.</NOTE>,
might amount to about four hundred thousand pounds:
And for once the King and parliament parted in friend∣ship
and good humour. The hatred, which the ca∣tholics
seemed to bear him, gave him, at this time, an
additional value in the eyes of his people. The only
point, in which the commons gave him displeasure, was
by discovering their constant goodwill to the puritans,
in whose favour they desired a conference with the
Lords<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 April 1606.</NOTE>: which was rejected.</P>
<P>THE aid, granted by Parliament, was payable in
four years; and the King's profusion, joined to the
necessary charges of the government, had already
very much anticipated this supply, and disposed him to
dissipate, in a very little time, among his friends and
courtiers, the residue of it. To engage him farther
into expence, his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark
payed him a visit this summer; and the whole court
was employed in feasting and revelry, in masques and
interludes<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 676.</NOTE>. Great erudition and profound morality,
with little taste or pleasantry, prevail in all these enter∣tainments:
Mystery, allegory, and allusion reign
throughout. Italy was then the model for wit and
ingenuity among the European nations. France her∣self,
who afterwards set so much better patterns of
elegance and pleasure, was at that time contented to
copy servilely laboured and romantic inventions of her
southern neighbour.</P>
<P>THE chief affair which was transacted next session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>
was the intended union of the two kingdoms. Nothing
could exceed the King's passion and zeal for this noble
enterprize, but the parliament's prejudice and reluct∣ance
against it. There remain two excellent speeches
<PB N="553" REF="620"/>
in favour of the union, which deserve to be compared
together; that of the King<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">K. James's works, p. 509.</NOTE>, and that of Sir Francis
Bacon. Those, who affect in every thing such an
extreme contempt for James, will be surprised to find,
that his discourse, both for good reasoning and eloquent
composition, approaches very near that of a man, who
was undoubtedly, at that time, one of the greatest
geniuses of Europe. A few trivial indiscretions and
indecorums may be said to characterize the harangue
of the monarch, and mark it for his own. And in
general, so open and avowed a declaration in favour
of a measure, where he had taken no care, by any pre∣caution
or intrigue, to ensure success, may safely be
pronounced a very great indiscretion. But the art of
managing parliaments, by private interest or cabal,
being found hitherto of little use or necessity, was not,
as yet, become a part of English politics. In the
common course of affairs, government could be con∣ducted
without their assistance; and when their con∣currence
became requisite to the measures of the
crown, it was, generally speaking, except in times
of great faction and discontent, obtained without
much difficulty.</P>
<P>THE King's influence seems to have rendered the
Scots parliament very cordial in all the steps, which
they took towards the union. Tho' the advantages
which Scotland might hope from that measure, were
more considerable; yet were the objections too, with
regard to that kingdom, more striking and obvious.
The benefit, which must have resulted to England,
both by accession of strength and security, was not
despicable; and as the English were, by far, the greater
nation, and possessed the seat of government, the ob∣jections,
either from the point of honour or from jea∣lousy,
<PB N="554" REF="621"/>
could not reasonably have any place among
them. The English parliament indeed seem to have
been swayed merely by the vulgar motive of national
antipathy. And thy persisted so obstinately in their
prejudices, that all the efforts for a thorough union
and incorporation, ended only in the abolition of the
hostile laws, formerly enacted between the king∣doms<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The commons were even so averse to the union, that they had com∣plained in the former session to the lords of the bishop of Bristol, for writing a book in favour of it; and the prelate was obliged to make submissions for this offence. The crime imputed to him seems to have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sisted in his treating of a subject, which lay before the parliament. So little notion had they as yet of general liberty! See parliamentary history, vol. 5. p. 108, 109, 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME precipitant steps, which the King, a little
after his accession, had taken, in order to pormote his
favourite project, had been here observed to do more
injury than service. From his own authority, he had
assumed the title of King of Great Britain; and had
quartered the arms of Scotland, with those of Eng∣land,
in all coins, flags, and ensigns. And he had
engaged the judges to make a declaration, that all those,
who, after the union of the crowns, should be born
in either kingdom, were, for that reason alone, natu∣ralized
in both. This was a nice question, and, ac∣cording
to the ideas of those times, susceptible of sub∣tile
reasoning on both sides. The King was the same:
The parliaments were different. To render the peo∣ple
therefore the same, we must suppose, that the
sovereign authority resides chiefly in the prince, and
that these popular assemblies are rather ordained to
assist with money and advice, than indued with any
controuling or active powers in the government. <HI>It is
evident,</HI> says Bacon in his pleadings on this subject,
<HI>that all other commonwealths, monarchies only excepted, do
<PB N="555" REF="622"/>
subsist by a law precedent. For where authority is divided
amongst many officers, and they not perpetual, but annual or
temporary, and not to receive their authority but by election,
and certain persons to have voices only in that election, and
the like; these are busy and curious frames, which of ne∣cessity
do presuppose a law precedent, written or unwrit∣ten
to guide and direct them: But in monarchies, especially
hereditary, that is, when several families or lineages of
people do submit themselves to one line, imperial or royal;
the submission is more natural and simple; which afterwards,
by law subsequent, is perfected and made more formal; but
that is grounded upon nature</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon's works, vol. 4. p. 190, 191. Edit. 1730.</NOTE>. It would seem from this
reasoning, that the idea of an <HI>hereditary, limited</HI> mon∣archy,
tho' implicitly supposed in many public trans∣actions,
had never, as yet, been expressly formed by any
English lawyer or politician.</P>
<P>EXCEPT the obstinacy of the parliament with re∣gard
to the union, and an attempt on the King's ec∣clesiastial
jurisdiction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Journ. 2. 2 December, 5 March, 1606, 25, 26 June, 1607.</NOTE>, most of their measures, during
this session, were sufficiently respectful and obliging;
tho' they still discover a vigilant spirit, and a careful
attention towards public good and national liberty.
The votes also of the commons show, that that house
contained a mixture of puritans, who had acquired
great authority among them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Journal, 26 February. 4, 7, March. 1606. 2 May, 17 June 1607.</NOTE>, and who, together
with religious prejudices, were continually suggesting
ideas, more suitable to a popular than a monarchical
form of government. the natural appetite for rule,
made the commons lend a willing ear to every doctrine,
which tended to augment their power and influ∣ence.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="623"/>
A PETITION was moved in the house for a more
rigorous execution of the laws against popist recusants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1607.</NOTE>
and an abatement towards protestant nonconformists.
Both these two points were equally unacceptable to
the King; and he sent orders to the house to proceed
no farther in that matter. The house were inclined,
at first, to consider these orders as a breach of privilege:
But they soon acquiesced, when told, that this measure
of the King, was supported by many precedents, dur∣ing
the reign of Elizabeth<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Journ. 16, 17 June, 1607.</NOTE>. Had the house been al∣ways
disposed to make the precedents of that reign the
rule of their conduct, they needed never have had any
difference with any of their monarchs.</P>
<P>THE complaints of Spanish depredations were very
loud among the English merchants<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Journ. 25 Feb. 1606.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of June.</NOTE> The lower
house sent a message to the lords, desiring a conference
with them, in order to their presenting a joint petition
to the King on that subject. The lords took some
time to deliberate on this message; because, they said,
the matter was <HI>weighty</HI> and <HI>rare.</HI> It probably occurred
to them, at first, that the parliament's interposing in
affairs of state would appear unusual and extraordinary.
And to show, that in this sentiment they were not guid∣ed
by court influence; after they had deliberated, they
agreed to the conference.</P>
<P>THE house of commons began now to feel themselves
of such importance, that, on the motion of Sir Edwin
Sandys, a member of great authority, they entered,
for the first time, an order for the regular keeping of
their journals<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Journ. 3 July, 1607.</NOTE>. When all business was finished, the
King prorogued the parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="557" REF="624"/>
ABOUT this time, there was an insurrection of the
country people in Northamptonshire, headed by one
Reynolds, a man of low condition. They went about
destroying inclosures; but carefully avoided the committing
any other outrage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of July.</NOTE> This insurrection was easily
suppressed, and, tho' great lenity was used towards the
insurgents, yet were some of the ringleaders punished.
The chief cause of that trivial commotion seems to have
been, of itself, far from trivial. It was become the com∣mon
practice in England to disuse tillage, and throw
the land into inclosures for the sake of pasture. By this
means, the kingdom was depopulated, or at least, pre∣vented
from increasing so much in people, as might
have been expected from the daily increase of industry
and commerce.</P>
<P>NEXT year presents us with nothing memorable:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1608.</NOTE>
But in the spring of the subsequent, after a long ne∣gotiation,
was concluded, by a truce of twelve years,
that war, which, for near half a century, had been car∣ried
on with such fury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1609.</NOTE> between Spain and the states
of the United Provinces. Never contest seemed, at
first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce be∣twixt Spain and the United Pro∣vinces.</NOTE> more unequal: Never contest was finished with
more honour to the weaker party. On the side of
Spain were numbers, riches, authority, discipline:
On the side of the revo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted provinces were found the
attachment to liberty and the enthusiasm of religion.
By her naval enterprizes the republic maintained her
armies; and joining peaceful industry to military va∣lour,
she was enabled, by her own force, to support
herself, and gradually rely less or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose neighbouring
princes, who, from jealousy to Spain, were at first
prompted to encourage her revolt. Long had the pride
of that monarchy prevailed over her interest, and pre∣vented
her from hearkening to any terms of accommo∣dation
with her rebellious subjects. But finding all in∣tercourse
cut off between her provinces by the maritime
<PB N="558" REF="625"/>
force of the states,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1609.</NOTE> she at last agreed to treat with
them as a free people, and solemnly to renounce all
claim and pretension to their sovereignty.</P>
<P>THIS chief point being once gained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30.</NOTE> the treaty was
easily brought to a conclusion, under the joint media∣tion
and guarantee of France and England. All exte∣rior
appearances of honour and regard were paid equally
to both crowns: But very different were the senti∣ments,
which the states, as well as all Europe, enter∣tained
of the princes, who wore them. Frugality and
vigour, the chief circumstances, which procure regard
among foreign nations, shone as conspicuously in
Henry as they were defective in James. To a con∣tempt
of the English monarch, Henry seems to have
added a considerable degree of jealousy and aversion,
which were sentiments altogether without foundation.
James was perfectly just and fair in all transactions
with his allies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The plan of accommodation which James recommended is found in
Winwood, vol. II. p. 49, 430; and is the same that was recommended by
Henry, as we learn fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Jea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, tom. 3. p. 416, 117. It had long been
imagined by historians from Jeanin's authority, that James had declared to the
court of Spain that he would not support the Dutch in their pretensions to
liberty and independence. But it has since been discovered by Winwood's
memorials, vol. II. p. 456, 466, 469, 475, 476, that that report was
founded on a lye of president Rickardot's.</NOTE>, but it appears from the memoirs of
of those times, that each side deemed him partial to∣wards
their adversary, and fancied, that he had en∣tered
into secret measures against them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Winwood and Jeanin, <HI>Passim.</HI></NOTE>. So little
equity have men in their judgments of their own affairs;
and so dangerous is that entire neutrality affected by
the King of England!</P>
<P>THE little concern, which James took in foreign
affairs, renders the domestic occurrences, particularly
those of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1610.</NOTE> the most interesting of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 9 A parlia∣ment.</NOTE>
A new session was held this spring; the King full of
<PB N="559" REF="626"/>
hopes of receiving supply;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1610.</NOTE> the commons, of circum∣scribing
his exorbitant prerogative. The Earl of
Salisbury, now created treasurer on the death of the
Earl of Dorset, laid open the King's necessities, first to
the Peers, then to a committee of the lower house<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Journ. 17 Feb. 1609. Kennet, p. 681.</NOTE>.
He insisted on the unavoidable expences, in supporting
the navy, and in suppressing a late insurrection in Ire∣land:
He mentioned three numerous courts, which
the King was obliged to maintain, for himself, for the
Queen, and for the Prince of Wales: He observed,
that Queen Elizabeth, tho'a single woman, had re∣ceived
very large supplies, in the years preceding her
death, which alone were expensive to her: And he
asserted, that, during her reign, she had very much dis∣sipated
the crown-lands; an expedient, which, tho'
it supplied her present necessities, without laying bur∣thens
on her people, multiplied extremely the neces∣sities
of her successor. From all these causes he thought
it no-wise strange, that the King's income should fall
short so great a sum as eighty one thousand pounds of
his stated and regular expence; without mentioning
contingencies, which ought always to be esteemed a
fourth of the yearly charges. And as the crown was
now necessarily burthened with a great and urgent debt
of 300,000 pounds, he thence inferred the absolute
necessity of an immediate and large supply from the
people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> To all these reasons, which James likewise
urged in a speech addressed to both houses, the commons
remained inexorable. But not to shock the King with
an absolute refusal, they granted him one subsidy and
one fifteenth; which would scarce amount to a hundred
thousand pounds. And James received the mortifi∣cation
of discovering, in vain, all his wants, and of beg∣ging
aid of subjects, who had no reasonable indulgence
nor consideration for him.</P>
<P><PB N="560" REF="627"/>
AMONG the many causes of disgust and quarrel,
which now daily and unavoidably multiplied between
Prince and Parliament, this article of money is to be
regarded as none of the least considerable. After the
discovery and conquest of the West-Indies, gold and
silver became every day more plentiful in England, as
well as in the rest of Europe; and the price of all
commodities and provisions rose to a pitch beyond what
had ever been known, since the declension of the Ro∣man
empire. As the revenue of the crown rose not
in proportion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Besides the great dissipation of the crown-lands, the fee-farm-rents never increased, and the other lands were let on long leases and at a great undervalue, little or nothing above the old rent.</NOTE>, the Prince was insensibly reduced to
poverty amidst the general riches of his subjects, and
required additional funds, in order to support the same
magnificence and force, which had been maintained by
former monarchs. But while money thus flowed into
England, we may observe, that, at the same time, and
probably from that very cause, arts and industry of all
kinds received a mighty increase; and elegance in every
enjoyment of life became better known, and more cul∣tivated
among all ranks of people. The King's ser∣vants,
both civil and military, his courtiers, his mini∣sters,
demanded more ample supplies from the impo∣verished
Prince, and were not contented with the same
simplicity of living, which had satisfied their ancestors.
The Prince himself began to regard an increase of
pomp and splendor as requisite to support the dignity
of his character, and to preserve the same superiority
above his subjects, which his predecessors had enjoyed.
Some equality too, and proportion to the other sove∣reigns
of Europe, it was natural for him to desire;
and as they had universally enlarged their revenue and
multiplied their taxes, the King of England deemed
it reasonable, that his subjects who were generally as
<PB N="561" REF="628"/>
rich as theirs, should bear with patience some additi∣onal
burthens and impositions.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for the King, those very riches, with
the increasing knowlege of the age, bred opposite sen∣timents
in his subjects; and begetting a spirit of freedom
and independence, disposed them to pay little regard,
either to the entreaties or menaces of their sovereign.
While the barons possessed their former immense pro∣perty
and extensive jurisdictions, they were apt, on
every disgust, to endanger the monarch and throw the
whole government into confusion: But this very con∣fusion
often, in its turn, proved favourable to the mo∣narch,
and made the nation again submit to him, in
order to re-establish justice and tranquillity. After
that both the power of alienations, and the increase of
commerce had thrown the ballance of property into the
hands of the commons, the situation of affairs and the
dispositions of men became susceptible of a more regular
plan of liberty; and the laws were not supported singly
by the authority of the sovereign. And tho' in that
interval, after the decline of the peers, and before the
people <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad yet experienced their force, the princes as∣sumed
an exorbitant power, and had almost annihilated
the constitution under the weight of their prerogative;
so soon as the commons recovered from their lethargy,
they seem to have been astonished at the danger, and
were resolved to secure liberty by firmer barriers, than
their ancestors had hitherto provided for it.</P>
<P>HAD James possessed a very rigid frugality, he might
have warded off this cri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> somewhat longer; and wait∣ing
patiently for a favourable opportunity to increase
and fix his revenue, might have secured the extensive
authority, which was transmitted to him. On the
other hand, had the commons been inclined to act with
more generosity and kindness towards their Prince, they
might probably have turned his necessities to good ac∣count,
<PB N="562" REF="629"/>
and have bribed him to depart peaceably from
the most dangerous articles of his prerogative. But he
was a foreigner, and ignorant of the arts of popularity;
they were soured by religious prejudices, and tenacious
of their money: And, in this situation, it is no won∣der,
that, during this whole reign, we scarce find an
interval of mutual confidence and friendship between
prince and parliament.</P>
<P>THE King by his prerogative alone, had, some years
before, altered the rates of the customs, and had esta∣blished
new impositions on several kinds of merchan∣dize.
This exercise of power will naturally, to us,
appear arbitrary and illegal; yet, according to the prin∣ciples
and practices of that time, it might admit of
some apology. The duties of tonnage and poundage
were at first granted to the crown, by a vote of par∣liament,
and for a limited time; and as the grant fre∣quently
expired and was renewed, there could not
then arise any controversy concerning the origin of
the King's right to levy these duties; and this impo∣sition,
like all others, was plainly derived from the
voluntary consent of the people. But as Henry V.
and all the succeeding princes, had the revenue con∣ferred
on them for life, the Prince, so long in posses∣sion
of these duties, began gradually to consider them
as his own proper right and inheritance, and regarded
the vote of parliament as a mere formality, which ra∣ther
expressed the acquiescence of the people in his pre∣rogative,
than bestowed any new gift or revenue upon
him.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, when it first granted poundage to
the crown, had fixed no particular rates: The impo∣sition
was given as a shilling a pound, or five <HI>per cent.</HI>
on all commodities: It was left to the King himself
and the Privy Council, aided by the advice of such mer∣chants
as they should think proper to consult, to fix
<PB N="563" REF="630"/>
the value of goods, and thereby the rates of the cu∣stoms:
And as that value had been settled before the
discovery of the West-Indies, it was become much in∣ferior
to the prices, which almost all commodities bore
in every market of Europe; and consequently, the cu∣stoms,
tho' supposed to be five <HI>per cent.</HI> did not, in
reality, amount to a third of that value. The King,
therefore, was naturally led to think, that rates, which
were now plainly false, ought to be corrected<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 438.</NOTE>; that a
valuation of commodities, fixed by one act of the
privy council, might be amended by another; that if
his right to poundage was inherent in the crown, he
should also possess, of himself, the right of correcting
its inequalities; if it was granted by the people, he
should at least support the spirit of the law, by fixing
a new and a juster valuation of all commodities. But
besides this reasoning, which seems plausible, if not
solid, the King was supported in that act of power by
two direct precedents, one in the reign of Mary, another
in the beginning of Elizabeth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th April, 5th and 10th May, 1614, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> 20th February, 1625.</NOTE>. Both these Princesses
had, without consent of parliament, altered the rates
of some particular commodities; and as their imposi∣tions
had, all along, been submitted to without a
murmur, and still continued to be levied, the King
had no reason to apprehend, that a farther exercise of
the same authority would give any occasion of com∣plaint.
That less umbrage might be taken, he was
extremely moderate in the new rates, which he esta∣blished.
The law entitled him to levy five <HI>per cent.</HI> on
all commodities; yet he really did not, on the whole,
exceed two: The customs, during his whole reign,
rose only from 127,000 pounds a-year to 160,000;
tho' besides the encrease of the rates, there was a sen∣sible
encrease of commerce and industry during that
<PB N="564" REF="631"/>
period: But all this precaution could not save him
from the complaints of the house of commons. A
spirit of liberty had now taken possession of that house:
The leading members, being men of an independant
genius and large views, began to regulate their opi∣nions,
more by the future consequences which they
foresaw, that by the former precedents which were
laid before them; and they less aspired at maintaining
the antient constitution, than at establishing a new one,
and a freer and a better. In their remonstrances to the
King on this occasion, they observed it to be a general
opinion, <HI>That the reasons of that practice might be extend∣ed
much farther, even to the utter ruin of the antient liberty
of the kingdom, and the subjects right of property in their
lands and goods</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Journ. 23d May, 1610.</NOTE>. Tho' expresly forbid by the King to
touch his prerogative, they passed a bill abolishing
these impositions; which was rejected by the house of
lords.</P>
<P>IN another address to the King, they objected to
the practice of borrowing upon privy seals, and desired,
that the subjects should not be forced to lend money to
his Majesty, nor give a reason for their refusal. Some
murmurs likewise were thrown out in the house against
a new monopoly of the licence of wines<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hist vol. V. p. 241.</NOTE>. It must
be confessed, that forced loans and monopolies were
established on many and recent precedents; tho' dia∣metrically
opposite to all the principles of a free go∣vernment<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">We find the King's answer in Winwood's Memorials, vol. III. p. 193, 2d edit. “To the third and fourth (namely, that it might be lawful to arrest the King's servants without leave, and that no man should be inforced to lend money, nor to give a reason why he would not) his Majesty sent us an answer, that because we brought precedents of anti∣quity to strengthen those demands, he allowed not of any precedents drawn from the time of usurping or decaying princes, or people too bold and wanton; that he desired not to govern in that commonwealth, where subjects should be assured of all things, and hope for nothing. It was one thing <HI>submittere principatum legibus;</HI> and another thing <HI>submit∣tere principatum subditis.</HI> That he would not leave to posterity such a mark of weakness upon his reign; and therefore his conclusion was, <HI>non placet petitio, non placet exemplum:</HI> Yet with this mitigation, that in matters of loans he would refuse no reasonable excuse, nor should my Lord Chamberlain deny the arresting of any of his Majesty's servants, if just cause was shown.” The parliament however, acknowledged at this time with thankfulness to the King, that he allowed disputes and in∣quiries about his prerogative, much beyond what had been indulged by any of his predecessors. <HI>Parliament. Hist.</HI> vol. V. p. 230. This very session, be expressly gave them leave to produce all their grievances, without ex∣ception.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE house likewise discovered some discontent
against the King's proclamations. James told them,
<PB N="565" REF="632"/>
That tho' he well knew, by the constitution and policy of
the kingdom, that proclamations were not of equal force
with laws; yet he thought it a duty incumbent on him,
and a power inseparably annexed to the crown, to restrain
and prevent such mischiefs and inconveniencies as he saw
growing on the state, against which no certain law was
extant, and which might tend to the great detriment of the
subject, if there should be no remedy provided till the meet∣ing
of a parliament. And this prerogative, <HI>he adds,</HI> our
progenitors have, as well in antient as later times, used and
enjoyed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hist. vol. V. p. 250.</NOTE>. The intervals between sessions, we may ob∣serve,
were frequently so long as to render it requisite
for a prince to interpose by his prerogative; and it was
an established maxim among the lawyers, that all the
proclamations of a king were abrogated by his death<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12th May, 1614.</NOTE>.
But what the authority could be, which bound the
subjects, and yet was inferior to the authority of laws,
seems inexplicable by any maxims of reason or politics;
And in this instance, as in many others, it is easy to see,
how unintelligible the English constitution was, before
the parliament was able, by continued acquisitions or
<PB N="566" REF="633"/>
encroachments, to establish it on sixt principles of
liberty.</P>
<P>UPON the settlement of the reformation, that exten∣sive
branch of power, which regards ecclesiastical mat∣ters,
being then without an owner, seemed to belong
to the first occupier; and Henry VIII, failed not im∣mediately
to seize it, and to exert it even to the utmost
degree of tyranny. The possession of it was continued
with Edward; and recovered by Elizabeth; and that
ambitious Princess was so remarkably jealous of this
flower of her crown, that she severely reprimanded the
parliament, if they ever presumed to intermeddle in
these matters; and they were so over-awed by her
authority, as to submit, and to ask pardon on these oc∣casions.
But James's parliaments were much less ob∣sequious.
They ventured to lift up their eyes, and to
consider this prerogative. They there saw a very large
province of government, possessed by the King alone,
and never communicated with the parliament. They
were sensible, that this province admitted not of any
exact boundary or circumscription. They had felt,
that the Roman pontiff, in former ages, under pre∣tence
of religion, was gradually making advances to
usurp the whole civil power. They dreaded still more
dangerous consequences from the claims of their own
sovereign, who resided among them, and who, in many
other respects, possessed such unlimited authority. They
therefore deemed it absolutely necessary to circumscribe
this branch of prerogative, and accordingly, in the pre∣ceding
session, they passed a bill against the establish∣ment
of any ecclesiastical canons without consent of
parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Journ, 2d, 11th December; 5th March, 1606.</NOTE>. But the house of lords, as is usual, de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
the barriers of the throne, and rejected the
bill.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="634"/>
IN this session, the commons contented themselves
with remonstrating against the proceedings of the <HI>high
commission court</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hist. vol. V. p. 247. Kennet, p. 681.</NOTE>. It required no great penetration to
see the extreme danger to liberty, arising from large
discretionary powers in a regal government. But
James, as was natural, refused compliance with the ap∣plication
of the commons. He was probably sensible,
that, besides the great diminution of his authority,
many inconveniences must necessarily result from the
abolishing all power of this nature in every magistrate;
and that the laws, were they ever so carefully framed and
digested, could not possibly provide against all contin∣gencies;
much less, where they had not, as yet, attained
a sufficient degree of accuracy and refinement.</P>
<P>BUT the business, which chiefly occupied the com∣mons,
during this session, was the abolition of wardships
and purveyance; prerogatives, which had been more
or less touched on, every session, during the whole reign
of James. In this affair, the commons employed the
proper means, which might intitle them to success:
They offered the King a settled revenue as an equiva∣lent
for the powers, which he should part with; and
the King was willing to hearken to terms. After much
dispute, he offered to give up these prerogatives for
200,000 pounds a-year, which they agreed to confer
on him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">We learn from Winwood's Memorials, vol. II. p. 193, the reason as∣signed for this particular sum. “From thence my Lord Treasurer came to the price; and here he said, that the King would no more rise and fall like a merchant. That he would not have a flower of his crown (meaning the court of wards) so much tossed; that it was too dainty to be so handled: And then he said, that he must deliver the very coun∣tenance and character of the King's mind out of his own hand-writing: which, before he read, he said he would acquaint us with a pleasant con∣ceit of his Majesty. As concerning the number of ninescore thousand pounds, which was our number, he could not affect, because nine was the number of the poets, who were always beggars, tho' they served so many muses; and eleven was the number of the apostles, when the traitor, Judas, was away; and therefore might best be affected by his Majesty: But there was a mean number, which might accord us both; and <HI>that was ten:</HI> which, said my Lord Treasurer, is a sacred number; for so many were God's commandments, which tend to virtue and edifi∣cation.” If the commons really voted 20,000 pounds a year more, on account of this <HI>pleasant conceit</HI> of the King and the Treasurer, it was cer∣tainly the best paid wit, for its goodness, that ever was in the world.</NOTE>. And nothing remained, towards closing the
<PB N="568" REF="635"/>
bargain, but that the commons should determine the
funds, from which this sum should be levied. This
session was too far advanced to bring so difficult a mat∣ter
to a full conclusion; and tho' the parliament met
again, towards the end of the year, and resumed the
question, they were never able to terminate an affair,
which they seemed so intent upon. The journals of
that session are lost; and, as the historians of this reign
are very negligent in relating parliamentary affairs, of
whose importance they were not sufficiently apprised,
we know not exactly the reason of this failure. It
only appears, that the King was extremely dissatisfied
with the conduct of the parliament, and soon after∣wards
dissolved it. This was his first parliament, and
it sat near seven years.</P>
<P>IN the midst of all these attacks, some more, some less
violent, on royal prerogative, the King displayed, as
openly as ever, all his exalted notions of monarchy
and the authority of princes. Even in a speech to the
parliament, where he begged for supply, and where he
should naturally have used every art to ingratiate him∣self
with that assembly, he expressed himself in these
terms; “I conclude, then, the point, touching the
power of kings, with this axiom of divinity, that,
as to dispute <HI>what God may do,</HI> is blasphemy, but
<HI>what God wills,</HI> that divines may lawfully and do
ordinarily dispute and discuss; so is it sedition in
subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height
<PB N="569" REF="636"/>
of his power. But just kings will ever be willing to
declare what they will do, if they will not incur
the curse of God. I will not be content, that
my power be disputed upon; but I shall ever be
willing to make the reason appear of my doings,
and rule my actions according to <HI>my</HI> laws<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">King James's Works, p. 531.</NOTE>.” Not∣withstanding
the great extent of prerogative in that
age, these expressions would probably give some offence.
But we may observe, that, as the King's despotism was
more speculative than practical, so the independency of
the commons was, at this time, the contrary; and,
tho' strongly supported by their present situation as well
as disposition, was too new and recent to be as yet
founded on systematical principles and opinions<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It may not be unworthy observation, that James, in a Book called <HI>The true Laws of free Monarchies,</HI> which he published a little before his accession to the crown of England, affirmed, “That a good king, altho' he be above the law, will subject and frame his actions thereto, for example's sake to his subjects, and of his own free-will, but not as subject or bound thereto.” In another passage, “According to the fundamental law already alleged, we daily see, that in the parliament (which is nothing else but the head-court of the king and his vassals) the laws are but craved by his subjects, and only made by him at their rogation, and with their advice. For albeit the king <HI>make daily</HI> statutes and ordinances, enjoining such pains thereto as he thinks meet, without any advice of parliament or estates; yet it lies in the power of no parliament to make any kind of law or statute, without his sceptre be to it, for giving it the force of a law.” <HI>King James's Works,</HI> p. 202. It is not to be supposed, that, at such a critical juncture, James had so little fense as, directly, in so material a point, to have openly shocked what were the universally established principles of that age: On the contrary, we are told by historians, that nothing tended more to facilitate his ac∣cession, than the good opinion entertained of him by the English, on ac∣count of his learned and judicious writings. The question, however, with regard to the royal power was, at this time, become a very dangerous point; and without employing ambiguous, insignificant terms, which determined nothing, it was impossible to please both King and parliament. Dr. Cowell, who had magnified the prerogative in words too intelligible, sell this session under the indignation of the commons. <HI>Parliament. Hist.</HI> vol. V. p. 221. The King himself, after all his magnificent boasts, was obliged to make his escape thro' a distinction, which he framed between a king <HI>in abstracto</HI> and a king <HI>in concreto:</HI> An abstract king, he said, had all power; but a concrete king was bound to observe the laws of the country, which he governed. <HI>K. James's Works,</HI> p. 533. But, how bound? By conscience only? Or might his subjects resist him and defend their pri∣vileges? This he thought not fit to explain. And so difficult is it to ex∣plain that point, that, to this day whatever liberties may be used by private inquirers, the laws have, very prudently, thought proper to maintain a total <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence with regard to it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="570" REF="637"/>
THIS year was distinguished by a memorable event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of May. Death of the French King.</NOTE>
which gave great alarm and concern in England; the
murder of the French monarch by the poniard of
the fanatical Ravaillac. That experience, and repu∣tation,
which this heroie prince had been acquiring for
so many years; those treasures, which he had amassed;
those armies, which he had inlisted and disciplined;
were on the point of being employed in some great
enterprize, which would probably have changed the
face of Europe; when a period was put to his glory
by an enthusiastic madman, who sacrificed at once his
own life and that of the prince to his detestable pre∣judices.
Were the designs, ascribed to Henry by the
compilers of Sully's Memoirs, less chimerical, they
might be admitted, on account of the testimony, by
which that narration is supported: But such vast pro∣jects,
had they been real, he must have revolved and
digested in his mind for many years; and 'tis observ∣able,
that about a twelve-month before, he had been
very instrumental in making peace between Spain and
the United Provinces; a measure, by which he deprived
himself of the assistance of his firmest ally, and the best
able to second his enterprises. 'Tis more probable, that
the war, which, at the time of his death, he intended
to commence against Spain, was the result of ambition,
revenge, or love, in a powerful and military prince,
who had long wished for an opportunity of attacking
<PB N="571" REF="638"/>
his enemy, and who was at last roused by a sudden motive
or provocation. With his death, the glory of the
French monarchy suffered an eclipse for some years;
and that kingdom falling under an administration weak
and bigotted, factious and disorderly, the Austrian
greatness began anew to appear formidable to Europe.</P>
<P>IN England, the antipathy to the catholics revived a
little upon this tragical event; and some of the laws,
which had been formerly enacted for no other purpose
than to keep these religionists in awe, began now to
be executed with greater rigour and severity<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 684.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' James's timidity and indolence fixed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1611.</NOTE>
during most of his reign, in a very prudent inattention
to foreign affairs, there happened, this year, an event
in Europe of such mighty consequence as to rouze him
from his lethargy, and summon up all his zeal and en∣terprize.
A professor of divinity, named Vorstius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armini∣anism.</NOTE>
the disciple of Arminius, was called from a German
to a Dutch university; and as he differed from his
Britannic Majesty in some nice questions concerning
the intimate essence and secret decrees of God, he was
considered as a dangerous rival in scholastic fame, and
was, at last, obliged to yield to the legions of that
royal doctor, whose syllogisms he might have refuted
or eluded. If vigour was wanting in other incidents
of James's reign, here he behaved even with haughti∣ness
and insolence; and the states were obliged, after
several remonstrances, to deprive Vorstius of his chair,
and to banish him their dominions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 715.</NOTE>. The King
carried no farther his prosecutions against that professor;
tho' he had very charitably hinted to the states,
<HI>That, as to the burning Vorstius for his blasphemies and
atheism, he left them to their own christian wisdom; but
surely never heretic better deserved the flames</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 355.</NOTE>. It is to
<PB N="572" REF="639"/>
be remarked, that, at this period, all over Europe, ex∣cept
in Holland alone, the practice of burning here∣tics
still prevailed, even in protestant countries; and
instances were not wanting in England, during the
reign of James. The Dutch themselves were, at
last, by state intrigue, and the tyranny of Prince Mau∣rice,
forced from their rational and humane maxims;
and the persecuting bigots, a little after this time, sig∣nalized
their power by the death of the virtuous Barne∣velt,
and the imprisonment of the virtuous and learned
Grotius. The scholastic controversies about free-will,
and grace, and predestination, begot these violent con∣vulsions.</P>
<P>IN
tracing the coherence among the systems of mo∣dern
theology, we may observe, that the doctrine of
absolute decrees has ever been intimately connected
with the enthusiastic spirit; as that doctrine affords
the highest subject of joy, triumph, and security, to the
supposed elect, and exalts them, by infinite degrees,
above the rest of mankind. All the first reformers
adopted these principles; and the Jansenists too, a
fanatical set in France, not to mention the Mahome∣tans
in Asia, have ever embraced them. As the Lu∣theran
establishments were subjected to episcopal juris∣diction,
their enthusiastic genius gradually decayed,
and men had leisure to perceive the absurdity of sup∣posing
God to punish, by infinite torments, what he
himself, from all eternity, had unchangeably decreed.
The King, tho', at this time, his Calvinistic educa∣tion
had rivetted him in the doctrine of absolute de∣crees,
yet, being a zealous partizan of episcopacy, was
insensibly ingaged, towards the end of his reign, to
favour the milder theology of Arminius. Even in so
great a doctor, the genius of the religion prevailed over
its speculative tenets; and with him, the whole clergy
gradually dropped the more rigid principles of absolute
<PB N="573" REF="640"/>
reprobation and unconditional decrees. Some noise
was, at first, made about these innovations; but being
drowned in the fury of factions and civil wars which
succeeded, the scholastic arguments made an insigni∣ficant
figure amidst those violent disputes about civil and
ecclesiastical power with which the nation was agitated.
And upon the restoration, the church, tho' she still
retained her old subscriptions and articles of faith, was
found to have totally changed her speculative doctrines,
and to have embraced tenets more suitable to the
genius of her discipline and worship, without its
being possible to assign the precise period, in which the
alteration was produced.</P>
<P>IT may be worth observing, that, about this time,
James, from his great desire to promote controversial
divinity, erected a college at Chelsea for the entertain∣ment
of twenty persons, who should be entirely employ∣ed
in refuting the papists and puritans<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 685. Camden's Brit. vol. I. p. 370. Gibson's edit.</NOTE>. All the ef∣forts
of the great Bacon could not procure an establish∣ment
for the cultivation of natural philosophy: Even
to this day, no society has been instituted for the po∣lishing
and fixing our language. The only encourage∣ment,
which the sovereign in England has ever given
to any thing, that has the appearance of science, was
this short-lived establishment of James; an institution
quite superfluous, considering the unhappy propension,
which, at that time, so universally possessed the nation
for polemical divinity.</P>
<P>TO consider James in a more advantageous light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE>
we must take a view of him as the legislator of Ireland;
and most of the institutions, which he had framed for
the civilizing that kingdom, being finished about this
period, it may not here be improper to give some ac∣count
<PB N="574" REF="641"/>
of them. He frequently boasts of the manage∣ment
of Ireland as his master-piece; and it will ap∣pear,
upon inquiry, that his vanity, in this particular,
was not altogether without foundation.</P>
<P>AFTER the subjection of Ireland by Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> the
more difficult task still remained; to civilize the bar∣barous
inhabitants, to reconcile them to laws and in∣dustry,
and to render their subjection durable and useful
to the crown of England. James proceeded in this
work by a steady, regular, and well concerted plan;
and in the space of nine years, according to Sir John
Davis, he made greater advances towards the reforma∣tion
of that kingdom, than had been made in the 440
years, which had elapsed since the conquest was first
attempted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 259. edit. 1613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was previously necessary to abolish the Irish cu∣stoms,
which supplied the place of laws, and which
were calculated to keep that people for ever in a state
of barbarism and disorder.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>Brehon</HI> law or custom, every crime, how∣ever
enormous, was punished, not with death, but by
a fine or pecuniary mulct, which was levied upon the
criminal. Murder itself, as among all the antient
barbarous nations, was attoned for in this manner;
and each man, according to his rank, had a different
rate or value affixed to him, which, if any one was
willing to pay, he needed not fear the assassinating his
enemy. This rate was called his <HI>eric.</HI> When Sir
William Fitzwilliams being Lord deputy, told Ma∣guire,
that he was to send a sheriff into Fermannah,
which, a little before, had been made a county, and
subjected to the English law; <HI>Your sheriff,</HI> said Ma∣guire,
<HI>shall be welcome to me: But, let me know, before∣hand,
his</HI> eric, <HI>or the price of his head, that, if my people
<PB N="575" REF="642"/>
cut it off, I may levy the money upon the county</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 166.</NOTE>. As
for oppression, extortion, and other trespasses, so little
were they regarded, that no penalty was affixed to
them, and no redress for such offences could ever be
obtained.</P>
<P>THE customs of <HI>Gavelkinde</HI> and <HI>Tanistry</HI> were at∣tended
with the same absurdity in the distribution of
property. Upon the death of any person, his land,
by the custom of Gavelkinde, was divided among all
the males of the sept or family, both bastard and legi∣timate:
And, after partition made, if any of the sept
died, his portion was not shared out among his sons;
but the chieftain, at his discretion, made a new par∣tition
of all the lands, belonging to that sept, and
gave every one his share<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 167.</NOTE>. As no man, by reason of
this custom, enjoyed the fixed property of any land;
to build, to plant, to inclose, to cultivate, to improve,
would have been so much lost labour.</P>
<P>THE chieftains and the Tanists, tho' drawn from
the principal families, were not hereditary, but were
established by election, or, more properly speaking, by
force and violence. Their authority was absolute;
and, notwithstanding that certain lands were assigned to
the office, its chief profit resulted from exactions, dues,
assessments, for which there was no fixed law, and
which were levied at pleasure<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 173.</NOTE>. Hence arose that com∣mon
bye-word among the Irish, <HI>That they dwelt west∣ward
of the law, which dwelt beyond the river of the
Barrow:</HI> Meaning the country, where the English in∣habited,

AFTER abolishing these Irish customs, and substitut∣ing
English law in their place; James, having taken
all the natives under his protection, and declared them
free citizens, proceeded to govern them by a regular
administration, military as well as civil.</P>
<P>A sufficient army was maintained, its discipline in∣spected,
and its pay transmitted from England, in order
to keep the soldiers from preying upon the country, as
had been usual in former reigns. When Odoghartie
raised an insurrection, a reinforcement was sent over,
and the flames of that rebellion were immediately ex∣tinguished.</P>
<P>ALL minds being first quieted by an universal in∣demnity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 263.</NOTE>; circuits were established, justice administred,
oppression banished, and crimes and disorders of every
kind severely punished<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 264, 265, &amp;c.</NOTE>. As the Irish had been uni∣versally
engaged in the rebellion against Elizabeth, a
resignation of all the rights, which had been formerly
granted them to separate jurisdictions, was rigorously
exacted; and no authority, but that of the King and
the law, was permitted throughout the kingdom<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 276.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A resignation of all private estates was even required;
and when they were restored, the proprietors received
them under such conditions as might prevent, for the
future, all tyranny and oppression over the common
people. The value of the dues, which the nobles usu∣ally
claimed from their vassals, was estimated at a fixed
sum, and all further arbitrary exactions prohibited under
severe penalties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE whole province of Ulster having fallen to the
crown by the attainder of rebels, a company was esta∣blished
in London, for planting new colonies in that
fertile country: The property was divided into mo∣derate
shares, the largest not exceeding 2000 acres:
<PB N="577" REF="646"/>
Tenants were brought over from England and Scot∣land:
The Irish were removed from the hills and fast∣nesses,
and settled in the open country: Husbandry
and the arts were taught them: A fixed habitation
secured: Plunder and robbery punished: And, by
these means, Ulster, from being the most wild and dis∣orderly
province of all Ireland, soon became the best
cultivated and most civilized<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH were the arts, by which James introduced
humanity and justice among a people, who had ever
been buried in the most profound barbarism. Noble
cares! much superior to the vain and criminal glory of
conquests; but requiring ages of perseverance and at∣tention
to perfect what had been so happily begun.</P>
<P>A laudable act of justice was, about this time, exe∣cuted
in England upon Lord Sanquhir, a Scots noble∣man,
who had been guilty of a base assassination upon
Turner, a fencing-master. The English nation, who
were generally dissatisfied with the Scots, were enraged
at this crime, equally mean and atrocious; but James
appeased them, by preferring the severity of law to the
intercession of the friends and family of the criminal<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 688.</NOTE>.</P>
