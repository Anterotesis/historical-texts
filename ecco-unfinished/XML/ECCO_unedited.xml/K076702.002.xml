</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT length a reign arises, undisturbed by the disorders of a minority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488</NOTE> and forming a strong contrast to the preceding in spirit, and ability. The young monarch was soon to de∣velope a character brightened with many illustrious qualities, and darkened with few shades. His strict administration of justice, by which the realm was maintained in a tranquillity long unknown, his uniform concord with his nobles, his mag∣nificence, his generosity, his patronage of useful arts and sciences, particularly navigation, which had been strangely
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>neglected by the Scotish monarchs, and even his spirit of chi∣valry, were to render his reign popular and glorious. Nor has it been unjustly asserted that the period of his domination was that of the greatest wealth, and power, of Scotland, while a separate kingdom. Yet some of his qualities were rather specious than solid, and rather belonged to chivalrous romance than to real life: in the high regal duties of a politician, and of a general, he was extremely defective; his natural im∣petuosity predominating alike in his smaller pursuits, and in his most important affairs. The avarice of the preceding reign he contrasted by a profusion, which secured the attach∣ment of the peers at the expence of the people. That super∣stitious devotion, which, with a few exceptions, was inherent in his family from its first elevation, till its final descent from the throne, was in the fourth James much increased by his re∣morse for the death of his father; and the mass formed one of his chief daily offices. The resources of his magnificence were not exempt from a charge of extortion: but his gentleness, and affability, won all hearts, and stifled all murmurs. Just in his decrees, the severity of punishment was softened by his visible reluctance to chastise. To admonition, or even re∣proach, his ear was open; and his sense of an innocent con∣science such that he listened without the smallest emotion. By a neglected education he was ignorant of letters; but his mind was acute; he excelled in music, in horsemanship, and other exercises; and a firm constitution enabled him to support every fatigue. His person was of the middle size, and ele∣gant; his countenance majestic<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Compare Lindsay, 159, 160; Lesley 330; Buch. XIII, 42. In the new edition of Leland's Collectanea, Vol. IV, p. 258, seq. may be found minute anecdotes of his manners, &amp;c. in 1503. One passage mentions that "his beard was somewhat long;" but beards were not then worn, and the meaning is such as would apply in our times, that he had neglected to shave, or to cut in close with seizzars, as, by the same account, was done on his wedding day.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<P>The fate of James III being unknown to the conspiring lords, they withdrew their forces to Linlithgow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> till certain information should be obtained. Tidings arrived that Sir An∣drew Wood's two ships, sailing up and down the Forth, re∣ceived in their boats several wounded men, among whom it was suspected that the king might have found his safety. The lords upon this advanced to Leith, and sent messengers to Wood, to enquire if James was aboard either of his vessels: the commander denied that he was; but the lords, unsatisfied, insisted that he should appear before their council, to which he consented upon condition that the lords Seton and Fleming should be remitted, as pledges for his safe return. Upon his appearance, he denied any knowledge concerning the king, and boldly reproached the peers for their treason; whose ven∣geance was only repressed by the consideration of their pledges<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 145—147. Buchan. XIII, 1. The former writer narrates the story with his usual circumstantial simplicity. The names of Wood's two vessels were, the Flower and the Yellow Carvel, (<HI>carvel</HI> a galley, a ship.) The passage in which James mistakes Wood for his father is pathetic, but can have no claim to truth, James being sixteen years of age, and certainly knowing his father perfectly. No hint of previous estrangement occurs: on the contrary the prince resided at Stirling, the chosen abode of his father.</NOTE>. Seton and Fleming having returned, upon Wood's deliverance, it was resolved to punish that brave officer for his insulting be∣haviour; but the captains and mariners of Leith declined the hazardous service, and informed the council that no ten ships of Scotland would dare to assault Wood's two vessels, such was his strength in men and artillery, and such his maritime and military skill<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 147, who on this occasion mentious BARTON, a name famous in the naval annals of Scotland. Buch. XIII, 1.</NOTE>. Amid the signal fortuitous advantages of the
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>reign of James III may be placed the first minute appearance of a warlike fleet in Scotland: and the warm loyalty of Wood seems to indicate that this establishment was indebted to royal patronage.</P>
<P>A short space of time certified the unhappy death of the late sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 June</NOTE> The solemn inauguration of James IV was no sooner celebrated at Scone, than a revocation was published of all lands, dignities, and offices, granted by his father, since the second day of February last; for the assigned reason that such gifts had been bestowed in support of a council who op∣posed the public good<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This revocation is mentioned in the Acts of Oct. this year, f. 83, c. 17.</NOTE>. The young monarch then proceeded to take possession of the castle of Edinburgh, which had been garrisoned by the late king: and to that of Stirling a new go∣vernor was appointed<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 148. Buch. XIII, 2.</NOTE>. But neither the cares, nor the plea∣sures of royalty could save his mind from the keenest remorse, when he considered his constrained share in the fate of his father. Residing for some time at Stirling the priests of the royal chapel deplored, in his presence, and even in their pray∣ers, the death of their founder; and the solemnity of religion increased the mental gloom of his son; who resolved, with amiable superstition, to wear constantly in penance an iron girdle, the weight of which he increased with his years. The Roman pontiff spared the youth and innocence of James; but darted the thunders of the Vatican at the rebellious barons, whose arms had been pointed against their sovereign<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, ib. Buch. XIII, 9. Lesley, 330. The popular opinion, un∣conversant in nice distinctions, was that James had slain his father. Comines, V, 18. Leland Coll. IV, App. Whitsuntide 1488.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the parliament, which assembled at Edinburgh this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Oct.</NOTE> the most remarkable act is that intituled, The Proposition of
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>the debate of the field of Stirling. By this statute it is de∣clared that the late king's want of sidelity, in the observance of certain articles, affirmed to the peers by his own subscrip∣tion; his confidence in perverse councils; and his partiality to the English; are to be esteemed the efficient causes of his fate: and that his son, and the conspiring peers, were innocent of any blood shed in that civil conflict<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 82. The chief managers of this parliament, and some of its proceedings, may be traced in Carmichael's Tracts, 76—78. Argyle continues chancellor, Hales is master of the houshold, Lyle justiciary, Home chamber∣lain, Knowls of Torphichen treasurer. The imprisonment of Angus by the late king, p. 77, seems unknown. On the 15th Oct. p. 78, Patrick Hepburn lord Hales was created earl of Bothwell. Titles were now becoming vague, the lords Lyle, Carlyle, &amp;c. being so styled from their names: but Bothwell had only the advantage of being a title already used. The barony had been forfeited by Douglas, 1455; and was before 1528 to return to Angus.
<P>From Scotstarvet's Calendars it appears that Largo was confirmed to Wood, 27 July 1488: that Hales or Bothwell was created "great Admiral of Scotland for life," in the same month: on the 10th Sept. an annuity of 300 marks was granted to James Douglas knight, (the degraded earl?) in Oct. the custody of Dunbarton castle, formerly held by Evandale, was given to Lennox and his son; as that of Stirling was, in the ensuing January, assigned to James Shaw of Sauchy, and John Shaw of Alweth his son. John Ellem was forfeited for de∣fending Dunbar against James III.</P></NOTE>. It is unnecessary to enter into the warm political disputes, which have originated from this institute of successful rebellion, which partakes so little of fundamental law, and so much of temporary circumstances. At present this aristocratic deed will be sufficiently understood to infer no advantage to public freedom. But in consequence of this parliamentary declaration, of the royal favour to the nobles during this reign, and of their increasing power under the succeeding minority; principles of government, far indeed from new, but unknown for many centuries, began to pre∣vail in Scotland. Enlightened enough to perceive the defects, incidental to monarchical government, but not to descry its
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>lasting advantages; and at the same time so unskilled as to pre∣fer many tyrants to one, and to confound the nation with the nobles, the interests of a million and a half of people with those of fifty chiefs; the Scotish historians, Mair, Boyce, Bu∣chanan, were to declaim against monarchy; and, under the name of the popular power, to support that of the aristocracy. As they have indicated no new organ, by which the national will was to be declared; and no reform in parliament, a body guided by the king, or by the nobles; it is evident that their views were either theoretical effervescences, caught from the classical writers, or tended solely to increase the aristocratic preeminence.</P>
<P>This parliament also decreed that an embassy should be sent to France, Bretagne, Spain, and other countries, to provide a bride for the king<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 79. Of the 26th Dec. 1489, appears a grant to Elphinston bishop of Aberdeen, for his services in his embassy to France, <HI>England,</HI> Bur∣gundy, Austria. Scotst. Cal. The main object seems to have been, the vin∣dication of James from the apparent murder of his father. The act of indem∣nity bears that it was to be shewn to foreign courts.</NOTE>. England being omitted, it is evident that the new reign had, as not unusual, reversed the political maxims of the former. The embassadors were likewise em∣powered to renew the league between France and Scotland: but this embassy was not effected. Other statutes appear con∣cerning the late civil commotions: all justices, sheriffs, stew∣ards, and other officers who had joined the late king, were, if hereditary, suspended for three years; if not, utterly incapaci∣tated: churchmen taken in arms were to be delivered to their ordinary, for legal punishment: those heirs who had been dis∣inherited by their loyal fathers, on account of their attachment to the prince, were restored to their claim: as a small act of grace, all goods, taken since the battle near Stirling, from
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>burgesses, merchants and unlanded men, though the late king's partizans, are ordered to be restored; together with personal freedom, and compensation. Such ordinances rather bespeak the influence of a party, than the equity of a monarch; while an act of general indemnity would have been a measure of justice and prudence. Decrees of a wider import order that foreign vessels shall only trade with the free burghs of the realm, and not purchase fish, nor enter into any commerce, at the isle of Leuis, or other distant places. The usual regula∣tions and privileges of the church are to be observed. It is ordained that a new coinage of gold and silver be issued; and that bullion be imported. The castle of Dunbar is ordered to be demolished; and the custody of that of Edinburgh is com∣mitted to lord Hales, with the care of the king's brother, James duke of Ross. The king is advised to travel through his dominions, for the administration of justice, and the lords of the justiciary are ordered to attend him, as he or his council shall appoint. For the more effectual security of public order, certain noblemen and gentlemen are empowered to punish theft, spoil, and other outrages, committed within the limits of their own domains, and the lands adjacent, till the king shall attain the age of twenty one years. It is remarkable that, in the specification of territory, the northern counties of Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, are omitted; with the islands Hebudes, and the Orkneys; a proof, among many, of the slow progress of public jurisdiction in Scotland<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts. f. 79—84. This curious record of the partition of justice may be found in our common histories, and illustrates the state of parties, and the power of the aristocracy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a session of parliament, held at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1489 21 Jan.</NOTE> nothing memorable was transacted, except the erection of the see of
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>Glasgow into an archbishopric<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Carm. 75.</NOTE>. A forfeiture issued against John earl of Lennox, lord Darnley, and Matthew Stuart his son, and Robert lord Lyle, for concerting measures against the administration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 April</NOTE> was formally rescinded<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. and 79. Darnley claimed the title of Lennox in 1483, in right of his grandmother, daughter of Duncan earl of Lennox; James IV, in the be∣ginning of his reign, granted the title. Stew. Gen. 153.</NOTE>. But this lenity was soon discovered to be premature.</P>
<P>Many of the nobles still nourished the memory of their loyalty to James III, and were much dissatisfied with the present measures. They affected to regard the king as a cap∣tive in the hands of his father's murderers; and to execrate the fortunate rebels, who, not content with escaping public vengeance themselves, dared to hurl it against the loyal and the good; and being the authors of injury, never could pardon. Alexander lord Forbes displayed in Aberdeen, and other northern towns and regions, the bloody shirt of the murdered sovereign, suspended from a spear; and loudly summoned all good subjects to revenge. This spectacle, like the robe of Caesar, aroused more than any power of eloquence: and the flame began to spread to a great extent, and violence, when it was suddenly extinguished. For the discontented nobles, (among whom were some who had engaged in the prince's cause, but had now reasons of enmity against his counsellors,) having fixed, and communicated, their designs, the earl of Lennox led a considerable force towards the north, to join their standard. Finding it impracticable to march by the bridge of Stirling, he turned to the west, intending to pass the Forth by a ford; and encamped at a spot called Tilly-moss. One of his followers, named Macalpin, deserted; and gave intelligence to lord Drummond, then apparently with the
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>court at Stirling, that the camp of Lennox was void of watch or military discipline, and exposed to every danger of security. Drummond, assembling a few attendants of the court, and volunteers, hastily advanced, and attacked the sleep of Len∣nox and his people. Confusion, death, flight, terminated the idle expedition. The captives were taken with indifference, and dismissed with contempt; except a few of tumultuous spirit, who were distinguished by punishment. The fate of Lennox is unmentioned in our annals, and statutes; but he was apparently captured and pardoned. This insurrection was the more remarkable, as Lennox had received his title, and the command of Dunbarton castle, from the young monarch. Lord Lyle, another favourer of the prince against his father, and Matthew Stuart, apparently the heir of Lennox, defended Dunbarton castle against the government; but that fortress was taken, and the succeeding parliament granted a remission to the captives<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 330, dates the insurrection of Lennox in 1488; Buchanan's chro∣nology XIII, 4, 5, inclines to 1489. The latter epoch seems confirmed by a letter of James IV to Arbuthnot of Arbuthnot, published in Nisbet's He∣raldry, II, 89, seq. dated 26 Sept. <HI>regni</HI> 2,=1489. The king desires him to keep his strong holds strictly, for the royal behoof, as the earl Marshal, Alex∣ander Master of Huntley, Alexander lord Forbes, &amp;c. are forming treasonable leagues at Dunbarton castle. The renewed forfeiture of Lennox, his son, and Lyle, in the parliament of Feb. 1490, (Carm. 79); and the remission to such of their adherents as held Dunbarton castle, in the same parliament, (Acts, f. 90,) concur in justifying the date here assigned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the most authentic account of this commotion, which can be drawn from our histories; many passages of which are still enveloped in clouds of obscurity.</P>
<P>Home was now appointed warden of the eastern marches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Aug.</NOTE> and he had, in the preceding year, been constituted great chamberlain of Scotland during his life. He was also no∣minated
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>governor to the king, with the custody of Stirling castle; and the tuition for nine years of the earl of Mar, the youngest brother of James. He was in fact the prime minister, during the greater part of this reigu, and in constant favour with his sovereign: the continuance of his power indicating much art, or much moderation<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Crawf. Off. 323 from the archives. Scotstarvet, at the end of the year 1489, mentions a grant to Alexander Home great chamberlain, <HI>cy</HI> (grandson and apparent heir to Alexander lord Home.

Off. 54, 55, from the records.</NOTE>. Nor was the favour of James consined to those peers who had asserted his cause; he soon learned that fidelity to his father was a pledge of similar attachment to himself, and extended his benignity to the whole aristocracy, a conduct productive of internal concord, and of the warmest support from his nobles, then the leaders of the people; so that his reign was to become remarkable for a strong comparative degree of splendor, opulence, and popularity<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Of this year the following curious grants occur in Scotstarvet's Calendars.

<PB N="11" REF="17"/>by the last parliament, to defray the expences of the embassy, is enforced; and it is declared that the king's remission of any person's share is void, as the king could not discharge a tax granted by the estates for an appointed purpose: an act leading to valuable consequences. A new revocation appears of all grants, and gifts, made of the royal revenue, since the coro∣nation of James. Auditors were appointed to inspect the accompts of the treasurer, and other officers employed in the management of the crown-rents both in this, and the pre∣ceding reign. To collect the king's property, or the proceeds of the royal domains, certain noblemen and gentlemen are nominated for each county; and there is reason to infer, from the enumeration, that this revenue was large, but we unhap∣pily find no estimates: it appears that there were now regal lands of more or less extent, in every region of Scotland, even to the Orkneys; except Sutherland, Caithness, the Hebudes, and the opposite coast from Knapdale northwards. The earls of Sutherland, and of Caithness, remote from the court, ap∣pear never to have engaged in faction; while the just forfeiture of the Hebudes had not been carried into complete effect from the want of a fleet, and of the means of supporting garrisons, necessary to maintain the possession of a remote district, and the obedience of a savage people, to whom the Scotish juris∣diction was unknown<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In 1475 John lord of the Isles was forfeited: in 1476 he was restored, on yielding Ross, &amp;c. to the crown. In August 1481 a charter to him for his ser∣vices appears: Scotst. Cal. Yet about 1490 he was forfeited, says Douglas, (Peerage 357 seq.) as appears from many charters between 1490 and 1498. But in Scotstarvet's Calendars the first mention of his forfeiture occurs in a charter of Aug. 1493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This parliament also proceeded to appoint proper persons, as a secret council to the king; among whom the earl of Craw∣ford,
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>whose title of duke of Montrose, had been recently confirmed for his life, appears to have been the sole follower of the late monarch, who gained admission: and this peer was indeed the chief loyalist who finally adhered to James III; the influence of the others being inconsiderable. No royal act was to be regarded as authentic, except it were subscribed by at least six of the secret council; and the chancellor's consent was indispensable.</P>
<P>Embassies of alliance were ordered to France, Spain, and Denmark. The truce, made with England, was enforced by regulations for the holding of solemn march-days, in order to settle differences, so long as the English testified the like desire. Many other statutes of public utility were passed, which reflect no small praise on the attention of the new government to the national advantage.</P>
<P>Amid the imperfections, and discordance, of the original accounts, it is difficult to adjust, with chronological precision, two events in the commencement of this reign; the trial of David Lindsay of the Byres; and the maritime battles of Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Andrew Wood with the English. The partialities of Lindsay the historian appear to have amplified these incidents; while his circumstantial narration confirms their general truth. The trial he ascribes to a parliament, held on the tenth of May 1489, while no record exists of any national council at that epoch: and he mentions that twenty eight lords, and as many great barons, were then summoned to answer for their adherence to James III; a circumstance palbably romantic. It would seem that David Lindsay had engaged in the confederacy with Forbes and Lennox; and that he was tried this year, but acquitted by an imperfection in the indictment. For the particulars, which are detailed with native simplicity, the original work mentioned
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>may be consulted; as their minuteness, connected with no great event, is unfit for historical narration<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 150—155. The parliament of Jan. 1489 might have formed a session of justice in May: and it certainly deprived David Lindsay, earl of Crawford, of two lordships, granted to him by James III. Carm. 75. Some such severe proceedings may have stimulated the rebellion of 1489, which Craw∣ford not joining, he was rewarded by the recognizance of his title of duke of Montrose.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has already been observed that, in the year 1486, a truce of three years had been concluded with England and the in∣denture of the heralds, in 1487, for a lasting peace, being annulled by the subsequent events, the expiration of the truce must be assigned to the month of July 1489: nor does any further treaty appear till December 1491; though the Scotish act of parliament above adduced, implies that a truce existed in February 1490<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 434, gives a permission by Henry to Knowles prior of St. John, to trade with one ship, for one year, if the truce with Scotland last so long: 21 Dec. 1490. In 1490 also appear, among his unprinted papers N<SUP>o</SUP> 4617, art. 78, 23 March, a warrant to pay the expences of the Scotish envoys, 23 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 4 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 10 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> and an order for the Scots wandering in the northern counties to return.</NOTE>. In such uncertainty it has appeared pre∣ferable to abide by the positive date assigned by Buchanan, who places the chief action of Wood on the tenth of August, fourteen hundred and ninety<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 155—159 dates both the actions in 1489. Buchanan, XIII, 2, 3, ascribes the first to 1488, and XIII, 6, the second to 1490. This discrepance of the accounts, yet their general similarity, and the fixed epoch assigned by the latter historian, concur to evince the veracity of the facts.
<P>Of the 14th May 1491 appears a charter, wherein James, considering the damage done to his subjects at sea by the English and Dutch, grants the isle of Inchgarvey, between the Queen's ferries, to John Dundas of Dundas, to build a <HI>fortalice</HI> thereon; with the constabulary thereof, and the duties on ships passing. Scotst. Cal. But Dundas neglected the affair; and it was not till about 1510, as will afterwards be seen, that James erected the fort.</P></NOTE>. The silence of the English annalists,
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>concerning these maritime affairs, will excite little hesitation with those who know the lame and meagre information, pre∣sented by the original historians of England at this period.</P>
<P>The barrenness of naval transactions in the Scotish history renders the deeds of Wood not a little singular, and interesting; for which reason the minute relation of Lindsay shall be fol∣lowed. Five English vessels having entered the Forth, de∣spoiled some mercantile ships belonging to Scotland, and her allies. James and his council, irritated by the indignity, ea∣gerly desired revenge, but could not prevail upon any masters of vessels to proceed against the enemy, till they applied to Sir Andrew Wood of Largo, whom they incited by large offers of men and artillery, of royal favours and rewards. Being furnished with an ample provision of men, cannon, and arms, Wood proceeded with his two ships, the Flower, and the Yellow Carvel, against the English, who were also not defi∣cient in artillery; and finding them opposite to Dunbar, an obstinate and sanguinary conflict ensued. Wood's extreme courage, and naval skill, at length procured the victory: the five English vessels were taken, and brought to Leith; the commander presented to the king and council. The spirit and conduct of Wood were recompensed by honourable rewards, by the favour of James and the nobles, and by the loud voice of public fame.</P>
<P>Henry VII, concerned at the unusual disgrace of the English flag, inflicted by a power unknown in the annals of the sea, offered a large yearly sum to any commander who should cap∣ture Wood. But the skill, valour, and fortune of the Scotish leader were now so celebrated, that fear repressed avarice. At length Stephen Bull, an English officer, engaged to seize Wood dead or alive; and was provided with three stout ships com∣pletely equipped for war. Bull passing to the Forth, anchored
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>behind the isle of May; where he awaited the return of Wood, who had escorted some merchant vessels to Flanders, expecting. that peace was established. The English captain seized some fishing boats, and retained the mariners, that by their informa∣tion he might not mistake his object. On a summer-morn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Aug.</NOTE> a little after dawn, one of the English ship-masters descried two vessels coming under sail, by St. Ebbs Head: the prisoners were ordered to the tops, that they might declare whether these vessels were Wood's, or not; and, upon their hesitation, freedom being offered in case this was the expected prey, they announced the Scotish admiral. Bull, with the exultation, of English courage, ordered the preparations for battle; and, after distributing wine and chearfulness, commanded all to their stations. Wood advanced, unconscious of foes, till he perceived the three ships under sail, and attired for combat. He instantly prepared, and addressed his men in the plain and boisterous phrase of the sea: "These, my lads, are the foes, who expect to convey us in bonds to the English king: but by your courage, and the help of God, they shall fail. Set yourselves in order, every man to his station. Charge gunners: let the cross-bows be ready: have the lime-pots, and fire-balls, to the tops: two handed swords to the fore-rooms. Be stout, be diligent, for your own sakes, and for the honour of this realm." Wine was then dealed around; and the ships resounded with acclamations.</P>
<P>The sun, now above the horizon, shone full upon the English vessels, and displayed their magnitude and force to the eyes of the Scots, with a dazzling and enlarged appearance. Wood skilfully attained the wind-ward of the foe; and engaged in a close combat, which continued undecide from morning till night, while crowds of spectators, assembling on the coast of Fife, expressed by their gestures and voice, their alternate hopes and fears. During the night the combatants lay by to
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>refresh and refit: at the dawn of day the trumpets again sum∣moned them to arms. The battle continued so obstinate, that the neglected vessels drove before an ebb-tide, and south wind, till they were opposite to the mouth of the Tay. At length the valour and seamanship of Wood prevailed: the three Eng∣lish ships were captured, and brought to Dundee, where the wounded were properly tended. Wood presented Bull to the Scotish monarch, and was rewarded as such eminent services merited. James gave a specimen of his future regal spirit by bestowing gifts upon the English commander, and his people; and sending them and their ships as a present to their sovereign; whom he at the same time informed that Scotland could also boast of warlike sons both by sea and land; and therefore de∣sired that Henry would no more insult the Scotish seas, else a different fate should await the intruders. Henry murmured thanks, and dissembled.</P>
<P>The English king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1491</NOTE> whose pacific policy was aware of the advantages to arise from a lasting amity with Scotland, had already formed the design, which by perseverance he accom∣plished, of uniting James with an English princess. It was apparently with a sole view to the security of this scheme that Henry now entered into a disgraceful negotiation. John lord Bothwell a favourite of James III, and Sir Thomas Tod of Sereshaw one of that king's servants, subscribed an engage∣ment at Greenwich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 April</NOTE> for themselves, and James earl of Bu∣chan uncle to the late Scotish king, importing that they should bring, and deliver into the hands of Henry, the king of Scots then reigning, and his second brother the duke of Ross: in expectation of which service Henry's avarice advances a small sum of money<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 440. The sum was 266 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 13 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> which is mentioned to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>iate the strange inaccuracy of Abercromby and Guthrie. It amounts to Scol. Scotish, that money being then to the English as one to three.
<P>A curious original letter occurs in Cal. B. III, f. 19. of this or the pre∣ceding year. It is from the <HI>Master</HI> of Huntley to Henry VII, and is dated 8th January. The writer requests Henry to remember the slaughter of James, by a part of his false and untrue lieges, as that monarch "stood in near ten∣derness of blood to your highness;" and to join and assist the lords in revenge. Buchan is referred to for other matters, and what he promises the writer shall perform. The direction is "Til the kyng's grace of Ingland."</P>
<P>In May 1491 the earl of Huntley was constituted lieutenant of the North, till the king had attained the age of 25. Scotst. Cal. In April the <HI>stewardry</HI> of March and Dunbar were assigned to Home. Ib. See notes 1489.</P></NOTE> So many difficulties attended this perfidious
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>and daring measure, that it appears never to haven been at∣tempted; and perhaps was originally a mere suggestion of the necessities of Bothwell, and Tod.</P>
<P>Another parliament having met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 May</NOTE> it was ordained that the alliance with France should be renewed<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 90. Du Tillet states a renewal by James on the 4th of March 1492: fol. 149, edit. Paris 1588, folio.</NOTE>; and, if possible, more ample privileges obtained in that kingdom, for the Scotish merchants: for which purpose, and for effecting the marriage of James, the earl of Bothwell, late lord Hales, and other embassadors of high rank, were appointed. Within a month after, the English court granted a passport for this embassy, which was also to proceed to Spain: but Henry pro∣bably by presents to Home, or others in the Scotish ministry, persisted to frustrate the intentions of marriage. Some of our writers affect to consider a papal interdict against Scotland, as the cause that the embassies repeatedly proposed had not been executed; but the pope's censures did not extend to the king, or kingdom, as appears from the absolving rescript of Inno∣cent VIII, soon to be noticed: the arts of Henry may there∣fore be regarded as the cause of delay; and against them the Scotish parliament could not provide, though centainly too wise to order embassies which could not be effected. A treaty
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>with Denmark was also again decreed. The days of truce, and warden courts, were ordered to be held in regular ob∣servance: so that a truce still existed with England; and it is to be suspected that the maritime actions of Wood were only exerted against pirates.</P>
<P>Among other wise statutes of this parliament<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 90—94. Douglas Peer. 434, mentions a GENERAL ACT OF INDEMNITY as having been now issued.</NOTE> the holding of high justice courts twice in the year is enforced; and it is ordained that when it shall be expedient, the sovereign shall move this most noble person thereto, as the clause is expressed. The very conflicts of some writers against such ordinances prove their spirit, and values; and a degree of bigotry must be required, not to perceive the preeminence of the legislative power above the executive.</P>
<P>The Scotish parliaments are soon to become more rare, and less worthy of historical commemoration: a few further no∣tices shall therefore be extracted from the acts of the present national council. In the burghs, the objects of great attention to a friend of freedom, all leagues are prohibited, and no burgess is allowed to ride in warlike attire, except with the king or the legal officers; regulations concerning the due ma∣nagement of their revenues are also instituted. To provide a proper public force, it is decreed that regular <HI>weapon-schawings,</HI> or displays of arms, be held four times in the year; and the different armour of each rank, and the penalties of failure are distinctly specified. The yeomen, from the age of sixteen to that of sixty, are among other weapons to bear the quiver and the bow; but these instruments were to continue the pride of England, and the fatal neglect of Scotland.</P>
<P>The pontiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 June</NOTE> Innocent VIII, expedited a rescript to the abbots of Paisley and Jedburgh, and the chancellor of the see
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>of Glasgow, empowering them to absolve those who had arisen against James III, and professed repentance: from this mandate it appears that some of the spiritual lords were con∣cerned in the insurrection, but they are unmentioned by our historians<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See it in Innes, II, 837. Drummond 126 erroneously ascribes those writings to Alexander VI, (Aug. 1492—1503;) whose exhortations to repent∣ance would have been truly ludicrous.</NOTE> About the same time Andrew Forman, a Sco∣tishman, one of the papal protonotaries, arrived with an ex∣hortatory epistle to the young monarch, persuading him to persevere, not in sorrow and anxiety, but in honour, virtue, and religion.</P>
<P>A truce of five years was concluded between England and Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Dec.</NOTE> by the plenipotentiaries who met at Coldstream on the Tweed. Instead of conservators a new form is prescribed; certain lords spiritual and temporal, of both nations, being named, who were to set their seals to the ratification of their respective sovereigns.<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 465, 470.

For Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> Tyler, read Sir <HI>William,</HI> as p. 314, and often in Rymer.</NOTE> But this treaty was vague, and never fully ratified on the part of James.</P>

<P>Eager to secure a matrimonial alliance with Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1493 May</NOTE> Henry empowered embassadors to negotiate a marriage between James, and Catherine daughter of Eleonora countess of Wiltshire,
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>one of the offspring of Henry's uncle, Edmund duke of So∣merset<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 529. Catherine is styled daughter of princess Eleonora, daughter of the late Edmund duke of Somerset, our uncle. The father of Catherine was Sir Robert Spenser. James I had married her grand aunt.</NOTE>. This treaty was ineffectual; but the truce was ex∣tended to the last day of April 1501:<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 June</NOTE> and Henry paid to James one thousand marks, in compensation of the damages occa∣sioned by the English infringements<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 534.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the next parliament<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 94—100.</NOTE> it was again ordered that the em∣bassy, for the royal marriage, should proceed to France, and other countries; the sum formerly voted for this purpose was enlarged to seven thousand pounds Scotish money, and was, by special clauses, guarded against embezzlement even by the sovereign.</P>
<P>The national council, with a laudable care, protected the privileges of the Scotish church, and endeavoured to preserve its independency from the encroachments of the Roman court. The foreign disposal of elective benefices was annulled; and the immunities of the sees of St. Andrews, and of Glasgow, which, a few years before, had been erected into an arch∣bishopric<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">As decreed in parliament Jan. 1489, Carm. 75, and ratified by Inno∣cent VIII, 1491. Chart. Glasg. Keith Bishops, 150.</NOTE>, were ratified; these prelates being empowered to confirm the election of abbots within their dioceses, exclusive of any application to Rome. The rival archibishops had brought a plea before the pope concerning their jurisdictions; and it was apprehended that the one or the other party might renounce his immunities, to win the papal favour: the par∣liament therefore desired the king to interfere, by seizing the temporalities of the discordant prelates, in case they refused to submit to an amicable domestic decision: and a further pu∣nishment
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>was held out, if they violated at Rome any statute of the realm, or privilege of the Scotish church. By some new and remarkable custom, many processes, even of laics, were dependent at Rome by appeals from the ecclesiastical courts: the three estates recommended to James to command the parties, by his embassadors, to return, and submit their suits to their ordinaries, or other competent judges. Benefices were guarded from papal exactions: and the former law was revived which prohibited any person from appearing as legate in Scotland, except he were a native, or had attained the rank of cardinal<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Many of the ecclesiastic immunities had been ordained by James I, "of maist noble mind," and emphatic expression, like the <HI>Menti Laudandae</HI> on the coins of Pertinax. James III continues to be mentioned with disrespect by the legislature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These ordinances express dignity and spirit; nor was the prudence of those concerning temporal affairs less conspicuous. Different statutes were enacted for the regulation of manu∣factures and commerce: and a large and formal revocation was made of all alienations of royal property since the second day of September, in the year fourteen hundred, and eighty-seven; the king having now attained the complete age of twenty-one years. One of the most memorable acts of this parliament regards that neglected mine of wealth, the fishery, an object still in its infancy after an elapse of three centuries: the importance of this decree may well excuse its insertion in modern orthography, but with much of its antique simplicity. "Concerning the great innumerable riches, which are lost, for want of ships, and <HI>busses,</HI> to be employed in fishing, as other realms have, that border on the sea; and for the advan∣tages of <HI>police,</HI> and wealth, to be attained by this mean, and the employment of idlers and vagabonds, who might thus la∣bour
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>for their livelihood, and for the common profit, and uni∣versal good of the realm, it is thought expedient by the lords of the articles, and ordained in this parliament, that there be ships and busses made in, (or furnished by,) all burghs and towns, within this realm; and that the least of the said ships and busses be of twenty tons. That these vessels be furnished according to the wealth of each town, in the number after mentioned<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">This number unhappily does not appear.</NOTE>; be well equipped with all necessaries, with ma∣riners, nets, and proper instruments for taking large fish and small; and be ready to pass to the fishery by shrove-tuesday next. That in every burgh of regality the officers cause all stout idle men to pass in these vessels for wages, and if they refuse banish them from the burgh: that in those burghs of barony, which are situated near the sea, the sheriffs pursue the same course; and upon failure the negligent officer, or sheriff, shall pay a fine of twenty pounds in the royal exchequer<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 98.</NOTE>." Such is this remarkable statute; which, notwithstanding its strength, appears to have produced no effect.</P>
<P>Except some minute negotiations with England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1494 13 June</NOTE> no inci∣dent worth mention arises till the appearance of another par∣liament<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. v. 100. Granger, cont. of Maitland, II, 716, ascribes the acts of this parliament to 1496; but the edition called the Black Acts is far from infallible in its dates. Murray of Glendook, f. 95, ascribes this parliament to 1494. Carmichael's Tracts indicate no parliament of 1496: Abereromby, II, 500, abides by 1494. Lesley, 333, assigns the famous statute of education to 1493.</NOTE>; after which, from whatever cause, none of these assemblies occur for the space of eight years. The laws concerning benefices were confirmed, and enlarged: and the exorbitant prices, charged by the craftsmen, were ordered to be reduced upon a due consideration of the value of materials,
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>and the price of provisions. This parliament derives singular honour from the celebrated statute concerning education, which is of the following purport. "It is ordained through all the realm that all barons, and substantial freeholders, put their eldest sons and heirs, to the schools, at the age of six, or at the utmost nine years; who are to remain at the grammar schools, till they have a competent foundation, and good skill in latin. After which they are to study three years in the schools of arts and laws: so that they may have knowledge in the laws, and by this mean justice be distributed through all the realm: those who become sheriffs, or judges ordinary, having proper understanding, and the poor being under no necessity of re∣course to high courts for every small injury. Any baron, or freeholder, failing without just cause, is to incur a penalty of twenty pounds<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 101.</NOTE>." This act appears to have contributed to∣wards the advancement of learning in Scotland, which the invention of printing now disseminated quickly over Europe: the names of bishop Elphinston and Gawin Douglas honour this period; but any further consideration of the subject is re∣served for a subsequent division of this work.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the state of Scotland was not a little prosperous. Free from foreign war, and blessed with a degree of internal tranquillity long unknown, the king, the nobles, the people, were united in mutual attachment and confidence. The libe∣rality of James formed a pleasing contrast to the sordid dispo∣sition of his father: and, instead of mean favourites the scourges of the people, his court was crouded with faithful peers, whose hereditary wealth at least exempted them from the baseness of avarice, and the atrocity of vulgar oppression. Their rank was founded upon honour; and honour may often supply the
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>defect of virtue, while conscious vileness stoops to every crime. The favour, and attention, of the sovereign, were equalled by the affection, and duty, of the nobles; who, from proud po∣tentates, became loyal courtiers. To encourage this reforma∣tion, now gradually advancing with the progress of refinement, the magnificence of James established frequent tournaments; in which the arms of warlike peers, often in former times the terror of the monarch, were now exhibited for his amusement. The young king, himself eminent in arms, and inflamed with the spirit of chivalry, and love of glory, delighted to behold and to reward martial skill. He repeatedly invited by pro∣clamation the earls, barons, and knights, to tournaments, and other warlike exercises; and at the appointed place, which was generally Edinburgh the capital city, some ran with spears, others fought with the battle-ax, others with two handed swords; while some shot at marks with the bow, cross-bow, or culverin. In whatever weapon each victor excelled, he received one of the same kind richly ornamented; and the heralds proclaimed his merit amid shouts of applause. The voice of chivarly refounded over Europe the fame of the Scotish court: and many an errant knight came from distant countries, to engage in this theatre of renown<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lindfay, 159, 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor was James less popular among the nation at large, who esteemed his regal spirit; and loved his amiable appearance, and qualities, and even his wildness of youth. Sometimes he would travel, disguised and unknown, through a great part of his kingdom, and lodge in the hovels of the poor; where he would provoke the voice of truth, so odious to royal ears, by questions concerning his own character, and conduct, with∣out any dread or anxiety at thus learning his reputation from
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>the universal voice. In these rambles he disdained not to shew his knowledge of medicine, and surgery; in which arts the rudeness of his kingdom afforded no superior.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 159, 162. Buch. XIII, 42.</NOTE> He had all that love of music, poetry, and the arts and sciences in general, which was hereditary in the house of Stuart. From a curiosity, inherent to such a laudable disposition, he caused a human monster, born in his dominions with a duplicate body above the waist, to be taught many languages, with music, and sing∣ing; so that it could perform both treble and tenor at once. To make some dicovery on the origin of language, two in∣fants under the charge of a dumb woman were sent into the isle of Inch Keith: but the self-taught speech has not been explained; and it is needless to add that it must have been orginal, and perhaps though there was some society, little superior to the brutish babble of those unfortunate beings, lost during their infancy in extensive forests<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Id. 160, 162.

<P>The youthful and vague amours of James rendere him little desirous of a speedy marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1495</NOTE> and his spirit of chivalry was to plunge his kingdom into two impolitic, and unnecessary, wars with England; the latter of which received a dreadful expiation in his blood, and that of most of his nobles. A ne∣gotiation was apparently now at issue between James, and the high-spirited duchess dowager of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV, who, with the female arts afterwards successfully practised by the French queen, appealed to the knighthood of the Scotish sovereign, in defence of the distressed. It is most probable
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>that gold was also effectual, in exciting James to the romantic design of raising Perkin Warbec, or Richard duke of York son of Edward IV, to the English throne. Anxious to prevent this treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> Henry VII appointed commissioners, not only to prolong the truce with James during their lives, but to offer his infant daughter Margaret, now only six years of age, in marriage to the king of Scotland<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 572. In March Henry had issued a commission to SURREY, to array the northern counties against any attempt of his enemies <HI>from Scotland er other parts,</HI> ib. 568; but it appears not that Henry yet expected that James would assist Warbeck.</NOTE>. This proposal was neg∣lected: and it was little probable that James should wait for so immature a bride; but, eight years afterwards, this event took place, to the surprize and lasting advantage of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>The story of Perkin Warbec,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496</NOTE> or Richard duke of York, is so well known that it is unnecessary to expatiate on a subject more properly belonging to English history; nor shall any discussion be here attempted of the arguments for, and against, his being the real son of Edward IV. It is particularly un∣necessary to make an excursion from the history of Scotland, in search of difficulties; and it shall suffice to commence with the arrival of Perkin at the court of James, which happened this year. The pretender brought letters of powerful recom∣mendation from Charles VIII of France, and from Maximi∣lian king of the Romans. Attended by an opulent equipage, and honourable train of foreigners, his majestic elegance of person, and manners, conspired to secure the favour of a youth∣ful sovereign, warmly open to the impressions of external splendor. Perkin represented himself as the second son of Edward IV, whom the remorse of assassins, sated with the blood of his elder brother, had permitted, and assisted, to
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>escape to the continent. Sensible of the truth of his report, or misled by appearance, or desirous to increase the importance and danger of a pretended rival to the English king, James assigned to Perkin in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the earl of Huntley; who united to her connection with the royal blood the praise of eminent merit, and beauty<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 335.

<P>The most curious, and authentic, intelligence concerning the preparations of James in support of Warbec, may be found in two original letters to Henry VII, from a spy whom he employed in the Scotish court. This spy was no other than the favourite of the late king, John Ramsay styling himself lord Bothwell, but only acknowledged as <HI>laird</HI> of Balmain in Scotland, whither he had ventured to return, amidst the general indulgence shewn by James to the friends of his father.</P>
<P>In his first letter<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">O. Vesp. C. XVI, 23, f. 152, Berwick 8th September; well written, and apparently by Bothwell himself. James III was the friend of men of education.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Sept.</NOTE> Ramsay informs Henry that he had re∣visited the Scotish court solely for his service, and had often solicited James and his peers to abandon their support of "this feigned boy<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Literatim "this fenyt boy."</NOTE>:" that James was to advance to Ellam-kirk with his army, accompanied by Perkin and his few troops, amounting to 1400 of all nations; and the Scotish king had determined to invade England on the seventeenth of Septem∣ber, in opposition to the wishes of the barons and people: but Ramsay hopes he will be punished for his <HI>cruel consent</HI> to the murder of his father. James had required Perkin to deliver up Berwick, and the seven sheriffdoms<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Their names are unmentioned.</NOTE>; and to pay, within five years after his establishment on the throne, the sum of one hundred thousand marks. Perkin demurred, but offered Berwick, and fifty thousand marks to be paid in two years.
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>Ramsay proceeds to inform Henry that he was present at the reception of Concressault<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Monipeny of Concressault in Berry, of Scotish extract. See Hist. de Berry par Thaumassiere above quoted.</NOTE>, the French embassador, who ad∣vised the continuance of peace between Scotland and England, but James complained of the ravages on the borders and the loss of his ships: that Sir George Neville had joined Perkin: that James was not possessed of one hundred pounds in money, till now that he had coined his chains and plate. He also states that the Scots were discontented; and many of the late king's servants wished to revenge his death<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Would see <HI>remedy</HI> of his death.</NOTE>: that Rodyk de Lalane had arrived from Flanders, with two small vessels, and sixty Germans, in aid of Perkin: that as the inhabitants of the sea-ports were with James, it would be easy for the English navy to destroy the maritime towns, and ships; and that the Scotish artillery remains at Edinburgh<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It only consisted of two great <HI>curtaldis</HI> sent from France, ten falcons, thrity iron cart guns, and sixteen carts for powder an <HI>stones,</HI> (the balls being then of stone.)</NOTE>. Ramsay con∣cludes with advising Henry to attack the Scotish army from behind.</P>
<P>The second letter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. C. XVI, 24, f. 154, no date.</NOTE> bears that Buchan was to undertake the matter recommended by Henry; that all were now encamped in tents, but Ramsay had passed to St. Andrews, and presented the cross-bow sent by Henry to the king's brother, who pro∣mised to serve the English king, and not to join the army; the bishop of Moray<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">"And now my lord of Murray passis our to him, gyff the king cummis to this journay, (as I dout nocht he will, incontrair his barronis willis, and all his hail people;) and my lord vill solist this young prince to cum to your graice."

<PB N="29" REF="35"/>to leave Scotland, and escape to the English court: that, on the twenty-eighth of August, a messenger had arrived from Dacre's brother to Perkin, and many of the common people of Northumberland had joined this pretender: but that if Henry will send an able general, more advantage man be gained over Scotland than any English monarch could aspire to, for these hundred years.</P>
<P>Such are these singular letters, which it must be remembered are written by a violent enemy of James.</P>
<P>Though the season was far advanced, James resolved to avail himself of the first impressions; and to try the disposition of the English in favour of the candidate for the crown. With this view he raised a considerable force, and entered Northum∣berland; where Perkin issued a manifesto, offering deliverance from tyranny, and genral amnesty, to his presumed subjects, with a high reward for the capture, or slaughter, of Henry Tudor. But the English were completely satiated with civil wars; and refused to join the dangerous standard of an antient foe, and of a dubious prince. The Scotish king, satisfied with having shewn the candidate to his people, and to fortune, was convinced that the scheme was hopeless; and became irritated by the failure of his design. In revenge, he plundered the coutry, or laid it under contribution. Perkin, either from just feelings, or just dissimulation, eagerly interfered, remonstrating that he would not desire even to secure the crown, at the expence of the blood, and wealth, of his people. James retorted with a sneer, "You are too careful of a nation, which acknowledges you neither for a king nor a subject; and which is wholly devoted to your chief enemy." After consider∣able depredations, the Scotish army returned loaded with booty<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 335, Buch. XIII, 14.

<P>Sir Thomas Dacre was appointed by Henry his lieutenant in the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1497 13 Feb.</NOTE> to defend that region against the Scots; whose king, as expressed in the royal commission, had invaded Eng∣land with a great army of rebels, and traitors, and, without commiseration of age or sex, had killed, plundered, seized fortresses, and given villages to the flames<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 647.

Perhaps the recent insurrection, and the imminent hazards of a defeat to the unpopular arms of Henry, while a pretender was ready to avail himself of every advantage, might well induce great prudence and apprehension.</P>
<P>However this be, such was the close of this war; which, on the part of James, now appears romantic and unwise; but has some claim to prudence, when compared with that which ter∣minated his reign. The unpopularity of Henry's government, and the tried affection of the English to the house of York, might infer a degree of certainty to the design; and James had doubtless stipulated great concessions to his kingdom. But he was unaware of the many artful chains, by which Henry had fixed the pavilion of his royalty against the tempest of commo∣tion; unaware of that increase in the wealth and power of England, which enabled her sovereigns to delegate a Scotish war to a lieutenant, instead of honouring it, as in former times, with personal rivalry.</P>

His wife, who had faithfully accompanied his dangers, was an object of compassion and admiration. After the cap∣ture of her husband, Henry summoned her from St. Michael's mount in Cornwall, where she had taken refuge, for he was anxious lest her pregnancy might occasion repeated tumults: but his apprehensions were vain. Struck with her beauty, and virtues, he recommended her to the charge of his queen; and assigned her a pension, which she enjoyed many years after his death, the popular voice applying to her elegant form the title of the White Rose, the badge of her husband's claim<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 337.

He says Richard III ordered the murder of the sons of Edward IV, "ferro feriri jussit." He intersperses many poems and orations; among the former is one on the murder of Northumberland by the rebels. Perkin he regards as an impostor, but excuses James, "Rex errore deceptus, ut plerique alii, etiam prudentissimi, autea principes." After mentioning Warbeck's capture he adds, "Conjunx illius modesto venustoque vultu, egregia forma, atque aetate integra, in regium conspectum, magno cum rubore, et obortis lachrymis, producta est. Cui rex benignissimus humanissimo sie protulit ore." Then an oration, as usual; after which Henry sends her to the queen. This part closes three leaves after, with a speech of Henry to the rebels of Cornwall. It is surprizing that he is silent concerning the Scotish invasion, but his work has many chasms.

<P>This year that deplorable contagion, which corrupts the sources of pleasure and of generation, first appeared in Scot∣land; and an order of the magistrates of Edinburgh is pre∣served, enjoining the infected to pass to the little isle of Inch Keith, in the firth of the Forth<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Arnot's Edinburgh, p. 260 from the Council Register, I, 33, Sept. 22, 1497.

It is probable that the strangers, who attended Perkin, first imported this disorder; and the epoch deserves a place in history, which is often only a record of human misery.</P>
<P>The amity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1498</NOTE> which had been established between Henry and James, was in danger of a speedy interruption from an acci∣dental cause. Some Scotish youths visiting the town of Nor∣ham, which was only divided from their country by the easy passage of the Tweed, a dispute arose between them and the garrison of the castle, who accused them of being spies. A skirmish followed, in which several were wounded on both sides; and the Scots, who were inferior in number, were forced to retire, leaving some of their companions on the field. The matter being agitated in the warden courts without suc∣cess, James became enraged at the supposed perfidy; and dis∣patched a herald to the English court, denouncing immediate war, in case satisfaction were not made for the injury. Henry's phlegmatic temper was fortunately opposed to the warmth of James; and he explicitly declared the innocence of his inten∣tions, and his wish to punish the guilty. But the impetuosity of the Scotish king was increased by the necessary delay, and was with difficulty appeased by the insinuation, and sub∣missions, of Fox the bishop of Durham, to whom the castle belonged<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 337.

<P>The perseverance of the English king, and perhaps his pe∣cuniary influence over the Scotish ministry, at last prevailed upon James to hearken to the proposal of a connubial alliance.

<P>It is pleasing to diversify the repeated series of wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1500</NOTE> and negotiations, by some attention to the arts of peace. Among these the progress of science is peculiarly important, and in∣teresting: and it must not be omitted that, in this year, which commences a century of illumination, a third university, that of Aberdeen, was opened in Scotland. William Elphinston, the learned bishop of that see, was the founder of this edifice: the bull of erection and privileges had been obtained from Alexander VI, in 1494; but the mansion was not completed, nor the education begun till the present year<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Crawf.

<P>The royal charters of erection of this university, May 1497, and Aug. 1498, are extracted by Scotstarvet in his Calendars</P></NOTE>. Elphinston was excited to this laudable design, not only from a desire to
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>propagate science, but in the view of that improvement of manners, which had appeared in the west of Scotland after the foundation of the university of Glasgow. Learning long depressed in that kingdom by unfavourable circumstances, now began to dart deep roots, and to shoot with rapidity. Nor were the native muses silent; for the court of James resounded with the strains of Douglas, Dunbar, and other eminent poets.</P>
<P>About this time it appears that James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1501</NOTE> in his attachment to chivalry, instituted the badge, perhaps the order, of St. Andrew, or the thistle, fabulously ascribed by antiquaries to periods more remote, while the only doubt of a rational en∣quirer is whether this monarch, or his successor James V, must be regarded as the founder of this new order of knight∣hood<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesley, lib. IX, p. 439, mentions the order of St. Andrew, as bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zoned by James V in 1534, but is silent concerning its origin. The first authentic appearance of the thistle, as a Scotish badge, is in the poem of Dunbar The Thistle and the Rose 1503, and in the account of Margaret's reception and wedding, (Lel. IV, 358, &amp;c.) where it is called a <HI>charbon.</HI> In the valuable portraits of our monarchs, published by Jonston in his Inscriptiones Historicae Amst. 1602, 410, James IV appears with the thistle.

Nisbet Heraldry, II, 108, gives a strange chaos of inaccuracy concerning the order of the thistle, which he supposes more ancient than the garter! And he ridiculously confounds the badge of St. Andrew, the tutelary saint of Scotland, with a military order. If coins and portraits, ornamented with favourite saints, were to indicate an order of knighthood, a thousand orders never known might burst into celebrity from the mist of antiquarian reasoning. It is believed that not one knight of the thistle can be mentioned till the present century: the order seems confined to the monarchs.</NOTE>. The obscurity of its origin testifies its want of re∣nown, till it was revived with splendor in the eighteenth cen∣tury. The earldom of Moray, an important title, vacant as appears since it was forfeited by Archibald Douglas in 1455,
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>was now conferred by James upon his natural son by the daughter of lord Kennedy<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Scotst. Cal. 12 June 1501.

Sums, which might have contributed much to public utility, were sacrificed to vain shew, and upon the altar of mercenary beauty. Be∣sides vulgar and fugitive amours, the daughters of the nobles yielded to his attractions of person and rank: three ladies of quality produced pledges of his love; and by a fourth, the daughter of a gentleman of estate, he had two natural chil∣dren, the eldest now in his tenth year<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Alexander born in 1492, by Mary Boyd daughter of Boyd of Bonshaw.

<P>AN event of the greatest importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1503</NOTE> in its consequences, adorns the annals of this year. After much negotiation, Margaret, the daughter of Henry VII, at length arrived in

This interesting incident therefore well deserves a particular detail; and that law of historical elucidation, which requires that the circumstances of an event be brought into one connected point of view, demanded that the detail should be reserved for this place.</P>
<P>It has been related in the former book that, in September 1499, the Scotish monarch began to accede to the favourite design, long nourished by Henry, of establishing a connubial alliance. Next year, Henry obtained, from Alexander VI, a pontifical dispensation for his daughter's marriage to James, though they were only within the fourth degree of consan∣guinity<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 765.</NOTE>: and, in October 1501, the nonage of the princess excusing any slowness of procedure, James appointed his pleni∣potentiaries to conclude the affair; who were Robert arch∣bishop of Glasgow, Patrick earl of Bothwell great admiral of Scotland, and warden of the western marches, and Andrew Forman bishop of Moray<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ib. 776.</NOTE>.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That James shall at Candlemas next, personally or by proxy, marry the princess Margaret, who had attained the nubile age of twelve years on the thirtieth day of last Novem∣ber; and that no exceptions shall be made on account of con∣sanguinity, that bar being removed by the papal dispensation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the princess shall be conducted into Scotland, at the expence of her father; and shall be delivered to her husband, or to any personages impowered by him to receive her, at Lam∣bertonkirk, about the beginning of September 1503, and not before that time<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">She arrived in Scotland a month before, but the meaning is that James had no title to <HI>demand</HI> her till then. See his promise to that effect. Ayloffe's Cal. 314.</NOTE>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That Margaret shall, before the first day of July 1503, receive legal seizin of all the lands, castles, and other posses∣sions, usually held by the queens dowagers of Scotland; and if these be found insufficient to yield a yearly revenue of two thousand pounds sterling, or the then equivalent sum of fix thousand pounds Scotish money, her husband shall assign other lands to compensate the deficiency.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the princess shall be allowed to keep at least twenty-four English servants, besides her Scotish domestics: and her whole household shall be maintained, in due splendor, at the expences of her husband, who shall moreover allow her the yearly sum of a thousand pounds Scotish, or five hundred marks sterling, to be paid in equal sums, at the feasts of Easter and Michaelmas, for her private purse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That in case of the death of the king her husband, she may either reside in Scotland, or not, at her pleasure; and her jointure shall, in either event, be punctually paid.</ITEM>
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
<ITEM>6. That the king her father shall pay, as her dower, thirty thousand pieces of gold called angel-nobles, or the equivalent in other English currency; whereof ten thousand are to be paid at Edinburgh, eight days after the consummation of the marriage; other ten thousand at Coldingham on the anni∣versary of that day 1504; and the last ten thousand before the end of the year 1505<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The sum was small, the angel being 6<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> Yet in the then scarcity of money the portion might equal 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> of modern currency.</NOTE>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That if Margaret shall die without issue, before the com∣plete payment, the balance shall not be demanded; but if there be progeny the whole shall be paid.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Such was this remarkable treaty, which bears testimony in some clauses to the arts and avarice of Henry VII. In 1474, when money was perhaps more valuable, Edward IV had assigned twenty thousand marks as the portion of his daughter, upon her marriage with the prince of Scotland; and Henry allows only fifteen thousand marks, each angel-noble being worth but half a mark, upon a connubial alliance with the Scotish monarch. This will appear the more remarkable, when we consider that James is bound to renounce all claim to Berwick: and it must be concluded that the gold of England influenced the Scotish ministry and embassy. But the avarice of Henry, absurdly and impoliticly displayed in such a critical affair, defeated its own purposes. Had Berwick been restored to Scotland, to which country from its situation on the northern shore of the Tweed, and from long possession it properly be∣longs; and had the portion of Margaret been more worthy of an English princess, wedded to a king; neither injured pride, nor penurious finances, might have stimulated James to violate the peace, and to return to the ruinous connection with France.</P>

<P>No sooner was the agreement of marriage concluded, than the commissioners proceeded to a yet more important nego∣tiation. On the twenty-fourth of the same month of January, 1502, a perpetual peace was concluded between England and Scotland, upon the following terms<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 793—798.</NOTE>.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In all times to come there shall be an inviolable peace between the two kings, their heirs, and lawful hereditary suc∣cessors; and their dominions, and subjects of every deno∣mination.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Neither of the said kings, nor of their successors, shall favour rebels against each other, but shall imprison, and deliver them up, if in their power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All safe-conducts, or promises of protection, granted by either king to subjects of the other, of whatever rank, shall be recalled; and never renewed except by consent of their own sovereign, and even in that case for one year only.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If either king be attacked, the other shall assist him with as many forces, and as often, as required, provided that the assisting troops be paid by the monarch assailed: nor shall any former league be urged as an obstacle to this agreement.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Scotish king shall not molest, nor besiege, the town, or castle, of Berwick; nor shall their inhabitants disturb the Scotish subjects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The allies of both kings to be comprehended, if they chuse; namely the kings of the Romans, France, Spain, Den∣mark, and the archduke of Austria, for both; Venice, Ferrara, Savoy, the Hanse Towns, for England: Alsace, Cleves, Bran∣denburg, for Scotland: their consent to be notified within eight months, else they shall be regarded as excluded: and
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>either king may assist his ally, if attacked by the other; but not by an invasion of each other's dominions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. No violation of this treaty, by the subjects of either realm, shall be construed a decisive infringement; but in case of a delay of redress by either monarch, he whose subjects are in∣jured may grant reprisals, either by land or sea, according to the wrong.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The death of James, or Margaret, before marriage, shall not frustrate this pacification, except either of the kings or their heirs shall notify, within two months after such an event, that he withdraws from the treaty: but even in this case the truce of 1499, for the life of the survivor, is to remain in full effect.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The successors to either kingdom shall ratify the alliance, within six months after their accession. The contracting kings shall swear observance of this treaty, within three months after the marriage: and, finally, the sanction of the pontiff to this peace shall be obtained before the first of July 1503, and the violator shall incur excommunication.</ITEM>

<P>Thus was a pacification established between England and Scotland, being the first since the year 1332, when Edward III infringed that concluded with Robert I. The nations had suffered one hundred and seventy years of wars, and dubious truces. Untaught by experience, they were again, in the course of then years, to resume their antient enmity. It was reserved till the age of Elizabeth for the English monarchs to secure an influence in Scotland, sufficient to counterbalance, and over∣come, that of France; and this influence was greatly indebted to the protestant faith. Centuries of disappointment had elapsed before England discovered how much the arts of policy are superior to force, and as in these France excelled, it is no wonder that her influence long preponderated. Nor need it
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>be disguised, in an age when patriotism is a species of mer∣chandize, that half the sums expended by England in war might have secured a perpetual peace: for such are men, that they must often be corrupted, before they will pursue their own political desires, their own interests, and those of their country.</P>
<P>To the character of Henry VII cunning more properly be∣longed, than wisdom; and even his cunning was often ob∣structed by his avarice. Did not human affairs so often depend on the caprices of monarchs, it were unworthy of history to observe that this covetous prince sent to the generous James a schedule of the allotments, to be paid to the servants of his daughter. James smiled, and assented<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 12.</NOTE>. Henry also obtained his request, that the ratification of the league with France, which had not been as usual repeated upon the accession of Louis XII in the year 1498, should be delayed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: but James solemnly protested against Henry's using the title of king of France in their negotiation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ib. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At length, after a number of tedious formalities, the royal bride, now in her fourteenth year, proceeded to Scotland, and, by a special favour, rather before the time affixed. Her father accompanied her from the palace of Richmond to Colliweston, in Northamptonshire; where he delivered her to the care of the earl of Surrey, who, with a noble and magnificent retinue, attended her journey, and was to present a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooming bride to James, whom he afterwards defeated and slew. In their pro∣gress they were met by the archbishop of York, the bishop of Durham, Northumberland, Dacre, and other peers, who ac∣companied the cavalcade to Lambertonkirk, a place a little to the north of Berwick. Here the archbishop of Glasgow, and
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>the earl of Morton, with a pompous train, received the bride, and conducted her to Dalkeith; whither James soon proceeded, and whence in a few days she made her solemn entry into Edinburgh. The scenes of splendour which ensued were worthy of the occasion, and of an age of chivalry<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Young's account, Lel. IV, 258, srq. Surrey, with the archbishop of York, and bishop of Durham, remained till the termination of the festivals. See also Lesley, 342. Buch. XIII, 21. Drummond, 133, 134.</NOTE> The gorgeous tournaments were invigorated by the valour, and graced by the beauty, of both nations. James himself, emulous of novelty, appeared in the character of the savage knight, attended by highlanders and borderers, who interchanged real wounds and disgusted the spectators with bloody pastime: but the king, as Buchanan remarks, had no occasion to regret the wounds, or the death, of marauders inimical to law and order. Arthur, and his knights of the round table, so familiar to the latter ages of chivalrous fable, also adorned the lists with their ideal personages. The solemnity of this marriage had been appointed so long before, that even foreigners attended the festival: and among these was distinguished a French knight, Anthony D'arcy de la Bastie, who was afterwards warden of the marches of Scotland, till he met with a cruel fate<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Drummond, 133. A strange confusion with regard to this warrior appears in our writers. Guthrie sagely baptizes him De la Beauté, though the Epist. Reg. Scot. repeatedly indicate all his names.
<P>The most eminent of the Scotish knights was Sir Patrick Hamilton, appa∣rently legitimate brother of Arran, though unknown to Douglas, and our other inaccurate genealogist. Lindsay, 161, 187, 188, &amp;c. repeatedly calls him brother of Arran; and particularly p. 162, explains his affinity with the king. That he was a legitimate brother is confirmed by Lesley, 394, Buchanan, XIV, 12, Young in his account, and Benoit André, Julius A. III, Jan. 1508, May, ib. Nay in April 1498 appears a charter to Patrick Hamilton, <HI>brother german</HI> of James lord Hamilton. Scotst. Cal. This celebrated man, who would do honour to any family, was slain in 1520, (see reign of James V.) He was, if not by a former marriage, the second son of James second lord Hamilton, by Mary sister of James III. His father died in 1479, (Douglas, 330;) his brother was created earl of Arran 13th Aug. 1503, says Young, who was present, and who adds that Montrose and Glencaim were also then created, the latter title had therefore been abolished in 1488 with other concessions of James III; the patent of lord Graham of Kincardine, as earl of Montrose, appears not till 3d March 1504.

But this Patrick must not be confounded with the former, who called James, natural son of Arran his brother, a bastard in con∣tempt, (Lindsay, 188,) a term he would hardly have used had he been one him∣self. Scotstarvet in Jan. 1513, mentions a charter to Arran, his only natural son Sir James Hamilton of Finnart; then to Arran's <HI>brothers</HI> Sir Patrick Hamilton, of Kincavel, and John Hamilton of Broomhill; and a legitimation to these three "my lord's bastards."</P></NOTE>. Successive

<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
<P>Among the numerous statutes of this celebrated parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1504</NOTE> the most interesting are those calculated to dissipate the bar∣barism of the highlands and isles. John, lord of the Isles, had been deprived of the earldom of Ross in the year 1476, as be∣fore related, and that earldom was irrecoverably annexed to the crown: but, in 1480, that despot had entered into negotiations with England, and was fummoned by the Scotish parliament to answer for his conduct. The succeeding commotions of the weak reign of James III prevented any further procedure: but James IV was no sooner arrived at complete majority, and capable of revoking any imprudent concession of his father, than a forfeiture of the Isles was issued against John, as appears from many charters under the great seal, between the years from many charters under the great seal, between the years 1490 and 1498<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Scotst. Cal. The first that occurs is of Aug. 1493: the revocation of James in parliament was of June that year. No new cause of forfeiture appears.</NOTE>. Angus, natural son of John, had been de∣clared heir of the Isles in the royal grant of 1476, if his father had no legal issue<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dougl. Peer. 362.</NOTE>: and Donald, a natural son of Angus, usurp∣ing the title of lord of the Isles, he, with Maclean and other abettors, were forfeited in 1503<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. and in Oct. 1505 the forfeiture of Torgil Macleod appears, for assisting Donald bastard of Angus, bastard of John. Carm. Tracts, 85.</NOTE>. Thus at length the Hebudes became the indisputable property of the crown; an event of great importance, and, after the vain efforts of many monarchs, reserved for the present reign.</P>
<P>The parliament therefore exerted its earliest efforts to intro∣duce law, and civilization, into the unhappy highlands and isles: and the first statute for his saltutary purpose is conceived
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>in the following terms. "Because there has been great abuse of justice in the northern and western parts of the realm, par∣ticularly the northern and southern isles<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">That is the Orkneys, and <HI>Sudoreys</HI> (or Hebudes), so called by the Nor∣wegians as being to the south of their possessions.</NOTE>, for want of <HI>justice∣airs,</HI> justices, and sheriffs, by which defect the people are almost become savage<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">"Allaist gane wyld." Acts, f. v. 102, c. 93.</NOTE> is is therefore ordained, in the design of re∣storing their tranquillity by the administration of justice, that there be in future justices and sheriffs appointed for these parts in the manner following. That the justices and sheriffs of the northern isles have their courts at Inverness, or at Dingwall, as the situation of the suit, and parties, may demand: and that another justice or sheriff be appointed for the southern isles, and neighbouring region, whose court shall be held in the Tarbat of Loch Kinderan, upon every due occasion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Campbell-town afterwards arose upon the spot.</NOTE>." The next act decrees that those parts of the highlands called Dowart and Glentowart, lying between Lorn and Badenoch, and the lordship of Lorn, all which had been unaccustomed to acknow∣ledge any courts of justice, should atten those held at Perth: that, of the other parts, Argyle, Mawmor, and Lochaber, which were in the like predicament, the two latter should fol∣low the courts of Inverness, the former those of Perth, where justice was to be administered in suits between highlanders and lowlanders, and where a special judge for Argyle was to re∣side. The inhabitants of part of Cowal, not comprehended in Argyle, were to attend at Dunbarton: and those of Knapdale and Kintyre were to join the people of Bute, Arran, and Cumbra, in their attendance at Air or Rothsay. By another statute<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 106, c. 114; c. 79 in Murray's edition.</NOTE> it is ordained that all the subjects, and especially those
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>of the isles, be ruled by the ordinances and common law of the realm, and by no other legislation. As the sheriffdom of Inverness had hitherto extended its jurisdiction over Ross and Caithness, an impotent amplitude arising from the inattention of the two latter provinces to legal administration, a sheriff is appointed for Ross, to hold his courts in Tain or Dingwall; and another for Caithness to administer justice at Dornock or Wich<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">But not courts appear for Sutherland and Strathnavern, the wild north-west extremity of Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such were the statutes formed to introduce law and order into the isles and highlands; godlike efforts, and before which the triumphs of war sink into contempt! The first real acqui∣sition of the western isles, effected by the reigning monarch, excited attention not only to their political situation, but to that of the highlands, a great part of which had been subject to the lords of the isles; and other portions to chiefs, who either affected a savage independence, or from consanguinity, friendship, protection, interest, or language, were led to regard the powerful successors of the insular kings as their only sove∣reigns. By the ruin therefore of that despotic family not only the western isles, but the highlands, became for the first time really subject to the Scotish government, as the above acts plainly evince. The acquisition of the Hebudes by Alexan∣der III was that of the nominal superiority; the conquest of Argely by Robert I was fugitive and vain. In the fifteenth century the Stuarts having acquired Lorn by marriage<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">John Stuart of Innermeath married the heiress of John de Argyle, lord Lorn; and appears as lord Lorn in 1404. Douglas, 415. About 1470 the lands, and title, passed to Campbell earl of Argyle. Ib. 416.
<P>The genealogy of the lords of the Isles would require a far more skilful hand than Douglas, who confounds the appellation <HI>De Ila</HI> (of Ilay) with that of <HI>De Isle,</HI> (of the Isles.) The succession of Argyle and Lorn is peculiarly indistinct. Barbour, b. iii, v. I, 659; x, 123—130; XV, 305—310, affords passages quite irreconcileable with the careless compilation of Douglas. Bar∣bour's John of Lorn died in prison, XV, 310; and the isles passed, or were assigned by Robert I, to a new branch, Angus of Ilay, (N<SUP>o</SUP> VI in Douglas,) called ANGUS LORD OF ILAY, and Bute by Barbour, XI, 334. His son John of Ilay, in 1354, enters into an agreement with JOHN OF LORN lord of Ar∣gyle, (Davidson's Tracts, Edin. 1771, 410, p. 29,) perhaps the son of Bar∣bour's John. The heiress of the last John wedded Stuart.</P></NOTE>, and
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>the Campbells of Lochaw being created earls of Argyle, the power and possessions of the lords of the isles were by these, and other circumstances, gradually weakened, till at last they were annihilated. But the patriotic efforts of this parliament had little influence over a deeply rooted barbarism. The ef∣fectual improvement of the highlands and isles was reserved for the eighteenth, and the following centuries: may it pro∣ceed, may it prosper, may those regions become the chosen abodes of industry, of art, of opulence; and may fortune re∣compense the inhabitants, so long to be classed among the most unindustrious, uncivilized, slavish, and unhappy, of mankind, by every accumulation of liberty and felicity.</P>
<P>Other statutes of this remarkable parliament are not un∣worthy of historical commemoration. It was ordained that a council should sit daily for the administration of justice, as the periods, in which the lords of session sat, were found too brief for that purpose: that the greatest crime should always be specified in remissions, and not veiled under a general pardon for smaller offences: that no forgiveness should be granted for deliberate murder: that notaries should be examined, and se∣verely punished if guilty of falsehood: that, as "the wood of Scotland was utterly destroyed," because the fine in that case was so small, the penalty of five pounds should be incurred for selling, or burning, green wood in future; and that every lord,
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>and land-holder, should plant at least one acre of wood, if there were no great wood nor forest upon his estate: they are also required to form parks replenished with deer, and to make ponds, rabbit-warrens, dovecots, orchards, and hedges<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 105, c. 109, Murray's edition, c. 74, "anent <HI>policit</HI> to be halden in the cuntrie," that is rural <HI>regulation:</HI> hence seems to have arisen the Scotish term <HI>policy</HI> for parks and pleasure-grounds, a metonymy of the word in the statute.</NOTE>. This statute is not a little singular in the goodness of its intention, and at the same time, in its negligence of the rights of liberty and property: but, as no penalty is mentioned, it may rather be regarded as a public and royal advice. Decrees of this na∣tional assembly also bear that, for the preservation of armour, there should be displays of weapons through all Scotland an∣nually, upon thursday in whitsuntide week: that one standard of weights and measures should be observed: that no distraint should be allowed of the animals, or instruments, of agricul∣ture, if any other effects could be found: that the inhabitants of lands, united to new baronages, should attend the courts of justice to which these baronages owed suit: that the provosts and baillies of burghs be changed yearly; and that none bear municipal offices except those who trade in the burgh: that the burghs, and the merchants, should enjoy their ancient privileges, "granted by our sovereign lord's progenitors, of most noble mind," an emphatical expression, not unused in former statutes. The parliament declares that it shall be law∣ful for the king to let all his lands <HI>in feu;</HI> and that, for the improvement of the country, all other lords and land-holders, spiritual and temporal, may follow the same mode. This kind of tenure first appears in the acts of 1457: the vassal was ex∣empted from military service, and was only bound to pay a rent in money, or grain, with some agricultural offices to the
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>lords; so that the cultivation of the country was by this prac¦tice greatly promoted<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Erskine's Principles of Scotish law, 8vo, book ii, tit. 4, § 2.</NOTE> A general revocation by the king, not only of all grants and gifts, but of all acts of the parlia∣ment or general council, prejudicial to the catholic church, his soul, or his crown, closes the statutes of this year. This singular revocation might occasion many reflections on its causes, and on the new power assumed by the sovereign, in the extinction of acts of parliament: but it would be vain to draw principles of government from statutes perpetually at variance on this subject, and indeed formed in an age ignorant of its nature. It may however be remarked that this revoca∣tion can hardly refer to the famous act of 1489, authorizing the slaughter of James III, as some suppose; for the king adds that he has commanded all such acts, as fell within his revo∣cation, to be cancelled; whereas the act of 1489 was faithfully preserved, and is printed in the first edition of the ordinances of the Scotish parliaments.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the particularity with which the transac∣tions of this parliament have been considered, and for which their interesting nature affords a sufficient apology, there yet remain three statutes which must not be past in silence. One of these enforces the observance of the former acts, concerning the vessels to be employed in the fishery; but still it appears not that any effect ensued. The two others relate to the con∣stitution of parliament. By the first it is ordained that no baron, freeholder, nor vassal, whose revenue amounted to less than one hundred marks of the new extent, established in 1424, should be compelled to personal attendance in parliament, except by special mandate from the king, provided they sent representatives; but all possessed of an income, exceeding the
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>above sum, are bound to attend the parliament under the an∣cient penalty<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">F. 106, c. 113. Concerning the new extent of 1424 consult Home lord Kaims, Hist. Law Tracts, p. 416, <ABBR>seq</ABBR> This statute rather tended to enlarge the prerogative; but at the same time it must be considered that attendance on parliament was hardly then esteemed a privilege, but rather as a constrained duty, and great hardship.</NOTE>. The second is expressed in these terms: "It is enacted that the commissioners, and chief men, of burghs, be warned when taxes or contributions are given, in order to have their advice therein, as one of the three estates of the realm<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">F. v. 106, c. 120.</NOTE>." It shall only be here observed that these acts testify the vague, and unsettled, nature of parliamentary representa∣tion, at this period.</P>
<P>The nuptial treaty, and perpetual pacification, with England, appear to have been passed with a singular negligence, on the part of France. Louis XII, occupied successively with the wars of Milan and Naples, could expect little assistance from Scotland in such distant campaigns: and the disposition of Henry VII afforded no reason for France to expect any ne∣cessity of the usual Scotish interference in a war with England. The new scene of politics opened to France in the Italian wars, and the settled peace between that kingdom and Eng∣land, seem to have induced such neglect of her Scotish ally, that the confederation had not been renewed; nor, as appears, even an embassy sent since the accession of Louis XII. Per∣haps the amicable disposition of James III towards England, and the dubious politics of his youthful successor, contributed to this indifference: but at length Louis, having lost the king∣dom of Naples, became sensible of the value of allies; and, to compensate his negligence, in this, or perhaps the preceding, year, sent an embassador of high rank and fame, Bernard Stuart
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>lord Aubigny, the conqueror and governor of Naples in 1501; but who had since been, by his precipitance at the battle of Seminara fought on the 21st of April 1503, the chief cause that the Spaniards gained from France that flourishing king∣dom<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib.

Dunbar ballad to Aubigny, 1504, Scot. Poems, London 1792, Vol. III, p. 136; perhaps the poem was written on his third embassy, 1508, in which year it was printed. The noble family of Lonnox, Darnley, Aubigny, deserves particular attention as being, after Mary's reign, the PA∣TERNAL ancestry of the royal line, or in other words the royal branch itself.
<P>Had Aubigny been in Scotland in 1503, it is impossible that he could have remained unnoticed in the minute accounts of the royal marriage. But this second embassy, (see 1484,) in which he was accompanied by Sellat, a French doctor of laws, is often mentioned in the Epist. Reg. Scot. Edin. 1722, 8vo, Vol. I, p. 71, (a letter of 1506,) p. 73, &amp;c. Aubigny was now advanced in years. John Stuart, first lord, was slain in 1429, and was after a long period succeeded by John his son; who in 1482 was followed by his son the celebrated Bernard.

R. S. I, 115, the first mentioned purpose is evinced.</NOTE>.

<P>James continued to cultivate the amity of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1505</NOTE> by in∣terfering with the duke of Gelderland, his relation and ally, in order to prevent that prince from affording aid, or protec∣tion, to Edmund de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, a representative of the house of York, who had been engaged in rebellion against Henry VII<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist. Reg. Scot. I, 11—16.</NOTE>. The Scotish monarch, with a laudable ambition, had begun to improve, or rather to create, a mari∣time power; and as appears from the valuable and elegant epistles, written at his command by Patrick Panter, a man of eminent prudence, and literature, the marine affairs of Scot∣land attracted a considerable share of the royal attention<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ib. 16, 17, 19. This elegant collection recalls to memory the epistles of Cassiodorus, dictated by Theodoric. It is to be regreted that Ruddiman, the editor, did not compare the MS. of the first volume, 1505—1524, in the royal library of England, 13 B. II, whence he might not only have corrected some errors, but have enlarged the work one third part, by letters omitted in his MS. The second volume, 1539—1545, (the intermediate volume, 1525—1538, is lost,) might have been equally improved by a collation with the MS. 18 B.

From Louis XII James required compensation for the loss sustained by Robert and John Bartons, a name celebrated in the annals of Scotish navigation; who having proceeded with two ships to annoy the English, during the war of 1497, their vessels had been stopped on the coast of Bretagne by the people of that country, and one of them seized<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Epist.

To the magistrates of Dantzic, who sent a similar representation to James, and threatened reprizals on the Scotish vessels which visited the shores of the Baltic, the answer of the king is spirited yet equitable.

<P>The power of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1506</NOTE> and her influence in the general concerns of Europe, were carried to a great extent, during this reign of an able and beloved monarch. James had warmly interceded with the emperor, and many other potentates, in behalf of Charles duke of Gelderland, who was almost over∣whelmed by the unjust claims, and ambition, of the house of Austria. Philip king of Castille, and archduke of Austria, had, to the firm support of his father Maximilian the emperor, united the promised assistance of England in favour of his pre∣tensions<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 21, 30—34.</NOTE>. But James, by his remonstrances to his father-in-law, prevented this design; and sent Robert Forman dean of Glasgow, and the lion-king-at-arms, to inform the duke of Gelderland of his success; to require the interference of France, and to negotiate with Maximilian<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 40—51. The title of king of the Romans, given to Maximilian, arose from his not having been crowned at Rome. See L'Art de Verifier les Dates, p. 451.</NOTE>.

<P>The affairs of Sweden presented another sphere of exertion to James. That kingdom, excited by the administrator Suanto Sture, was in a state of open rebellion against its Danish sove∣reigns. To protect the cause of his ally, John king of Den∣mark Norway and Sweden, the Scotish monarch dispatched let∣ters of conciliation to the archbishop of Upsal, and the Swedish senate; and to the people of Lubeck, who were about to assist
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>the Swedes. These letters breathe the usual regal spirit, but at the same time are models of elegance and force: they abound with salutary maxims, and even present rude features of a respect for liberty. James allows that an unjust king may be opposed by recourse to arms, provided that he had first been warned, in a national council, to reform his errors, and had rejected the advice of his people. To lend more effectual aid to John, a Scotish squadron sailed to the Baltic; but returned without any achievement, as the success of the Danish arms rendered the assistance at that time unnecessary<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. 34, 51. The squadron appears from the letter of James to Christina queen of Denmark, ib. 69, 70. Mallet mentions that Steno Sture, the predecessor of Suanto, had been constrained by the papal nuncio to set that princess at liberty in 1504. Abr. de l'hist. de Dann. I, 173.
<P>After epist. 27 appears in the MS. a letter to Anne of France, sent by Rothsay herald, notifying the birth of a prince, who however soon after died.</P></NOTE>. Though this contest between Denmark and Sweden continued for many years, it does not appear that Scotland used any further active exertion: the distance of the scene, and the perilous navigation of the Baltic, conspired with the prolonged and indecisive nature of the war, to render the assistance of the Scots most injurious to themselves, and of little advantage to their ally.</P>
<P>In the course of this year James also sent an embassy to France, to treat concerning the articles formerly brought by Aubigny. He likewise requested the permission of Louis XII, to have wood and ship-builders from France, in order to en∣large his navy<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. 70, 39. The envoys were Dunbar archdeacon of St. Andrews, and Antony d'Arcy de la Bastie.</NOTE>. This was a favourite, and laudable, pursuit of James, during the latter part of his reign; but which, with his other magnificent expenditure, contributed to embarrass
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>his finances. To save the disgrace of a reduction in his dis∣bursements, he now projected a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; a design congenial to his natural superstition, which was in∣creased by his apparent guilt in the death of his father<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See the close of the epistle to O Donnel p. 64. Compare Buch. XIII, 23.</NOTE>. The festivals, and splendid amusements, of James were interspersed with pilgrimages to the shrines of saints, in various parts of his realm: from the gayety of his court, enlivened with the charms of English and Scotish beauty, he would often retire to the gloom of a monastery; and the warrior shared, with the Franciscan friar, the favour of the king. The ridicule of Dunbar the poet, who was himself a debauched saint, testifies that the age was not so rude, as to be insensible of this incon∣sistency<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 344, 345, narrates the royal pilgrimages to St. Ninian's in Gallo∣way, and St. Duthac's in Ross. Letters of James in favour of the Franciscan friars, whose special patron he declares himself, occur Epist. 23—29. See Dunbar's poems, "How Dunbar was defyrit to be ane friar," "Dirge on the king's retirement at Stirling," &amp;c. in lord Hailes's collection, Edin. 1770, and the Maitland Poems, London, 1786. The influence permitted by James IV to this first order of jesuits excited the enmity of his successor, and the latin satire, Franciscanus, of Buchanan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears that the interest of the Scotish monarchs had fa∣voured the powerful family of O Donnel in the north of Ire∣land, in their contests with other Irish chiefs, and with the English<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In the Epist. R. S. 63 the name is spelled <HI>Odompneil;</HI> but from subsequent intercourse of James IV and V, with this family, (see 1531, &amp;c.) it is certain that the O Donnels of the north of Ireland are implied. In Scotstarvet's Calendars, at the end of this reign, appears a letter from James to Odo <HI>Odoneil,</HI> 25 June 1513, assuring him of protection, and aid, with men and ships if necessary, on account of the faithful service to the Scotish king, by the chiefs of the <HI>Connels,</HI> (O Don∣nels?) and lately by Odo Odoneil, father to this Odo, the king's cousin, in de∣fence and offence, and in taking a tenure of his lands from the kings of Scot∣land.

H. VII, p. 75. Odonnel had requested James to send John, son of Alexander Mackeane, (or Mackay, see 1532,) as leader of the 4000. A palpable chasm in the genealogy of the Mackays, Dougl. Peer. 569, may hence be supplied.</NOTE>. The answer of James is dilatory and dubious; and to the remonstrance of the Irish chief, who being apprehensive that the absence of James might leave his foes at perfect freedom to act against him, had re∣quested the king not to leave his dominions, a reply is given, shewing a fixed resolution to engage in the holy pilgrimage; which however was never undertaken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesley's history, infinitely superior to that of Buchanan, begins at the year 1500 to be very ample and curious: and from it a few events of little moment may here be annotated. Under the year 1505 Lesley mentions the law of re∣cognition, which giving offence was abandoned by James. In 1506 James proceeded on a circuit of justice. After his return, embarking in a large ship built by his orders, his excursion of pleasure nearly terminated in shipwreck. But when Lesley dates the first arrival of D'Arcy in 1506, he errs: and his title of protector of the faith, given by the pope to James, 1507, is a mere invention: nor are any heretics mentioned of the reign of James IV. The original letters evince both the errors.

<P>The warlike pontiff Julius II sent an embassador to James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1507 March</NOTE> with a consecrated hat and sword, as special marks of his re∣gard. In return the king flattered Julius with the vain tidings, received from Denmark, that Russia, her ally, desired to accede
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>to the latin church; and that the Danish monarch intended to send missionaries into that empire<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. 82, 85.</NOTE>. To Louis XII James now engaged to furnish four thousand auxiliaries for his Italian wars; but the French king having regained Genoa with un∣expected facility, declined the aid, with many professions of gratitude<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 83, 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If we believe our historians, the people of Holland, at this time subject, with most other provinces of the Netherlands, to the house of Austria, incurred the just resentment of James, by plundering some Scotish ships, and throwing the merchants and mariners into the sea. As this offence was piratical, no remonstrance seems to have been made by James, who sud∣denly dispatched Barton in a large ship of war: that spirited officer soon effected a retaliation, sent many chests loaded with the heads of the pirates to the Scotish court, and returned with no small booty and renown<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However this be, it appears from an epistle of the king to the emperor Maximilian, that Robert Barton was seized with his ship, the Lion at Campvere in Zealand, upon a remonstrance of the Portugueze, one of whose vessels he had taken. James ex∣plains the reason of this capture, which was that, in the year 1476, a Portugueze squadron seized a ship loaded with rich mer∣chandize, commanded by John Barton the father of Robert; in consequence of which letters of reprizal had been granted, and continued to Andrew, Robert and John Bartons, the sons of the sufferer, as no opportunity had occurred of effectuating a retaliation, till this late period<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. 88. Campvere, or Vere, is now Ter Veer, five miles north of Middelburg, the staple port of Scotland for some centuries.

<P>In a MS. in the marquis of Lansdown's library, N<SUP>o</SUP> 198, f. 129, is a copy of the letters of reprizal, granted by James IV to Andrew, Robert, and John Bartons, sons of John Barton, who was captured by the Portugueze, and to their assignees, to seize all Portugueze ships, till repaid 12,000 ducats of Por∣tugal.

Makadam, <HI>servitoribus nostris.</HI> Not only John Barton the father, about 1470, but all the sons are noted in our naval annals; and an uncle Andrew seems to have existed, as in the reprizals <HI>Andrew</HI> is styled <HI>the younger:</HI> yet perhaps he was the <HI>youngest</HI> son of John, though first mentioned. In 1510 Andrew Barton buys lands; and Robert in Sept. 1511, Scotst. Cal. Nay in 1508 the latter bought Over Barnton, ib. Sir Robert Barton became eminently rich, and was made comptroller of the royal houshold, in the minority of James V. They in some degree supplied, by Portugueze captures, the want of distant trade; and the blackamoor woman celebrated by Dunbar, (Maitland Poems I, 97,) was among the novelties laid under contribution by the Bartons.</P>
<P>Yet their contemporaries did not hesitate to call them pirates; and the justice of the letters of reprizal, after an interval of thirty years, may be much doubted, both in equity, and in the law of nations. At any rate one prize was sufficient for the injury; and the continuance of their captures, and the repeated demands of our kings, even so late as 1540, cannot be vindicated. Nay these reprizals on Portugal were found so lucrative that, in 1543, Arran the regent gave similar letters to John Barton, grandson of the first John. Epist. R. S. II, 166. These letters bear that Gaspar Apalha was sent to Scotland, in the reign of James V, to have the original cause solemnly tried, and it was given against the Portugueze, who however continued to neglect the payment. Any original documents of the capture by the Portugueze, 1476, would be important, as it led to such great and remote consequences.</P>
<P>In 1563 (Acts, f. v. 179,) Mary formally revoked the letters of marque to the Bartons, because they had been abused into piracy.</P></NOTE>. The naval annals of Scot∣land,
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>are so barren, that even unimportant information of this kind becomes interesting from its rarity. Nor may it be un∣necessary to add that, two years after this, Emanuel the for∣tunate king of Portugal, under whose reign such glorious maritime achievements had been performed by Gama, and others, and such new sources of wealth opened to his king∣dom,
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>condescended to remit an amicable remonstrance to James against these reprizals<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 103. Emanuel seems justly to complain that no previous application to his justice had been made.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1508 Jan.</NOTE> with his brother Sir Patrick Ha∣milton, had in the preceding year passed through England into France, without the knowledge or permission of Henry, was met on his return to Kent by Vaughan, an officer of that sus∣picious monarch. He was at first treated with distinction, but on his refusal to take an oath, apparently of fidelity, to Henry, he was committed to the custody of a guard<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Hist. H. VII, a Benedicto Andrea Tholosate, Julius A. III. This part of the work of Benoit André of Tholouse is the most curious, being a diary of the year 1508, which concludes his work. Julius A.

<P>André informs us that Arran had, in 1507, distinguished himself in a duel with De la Bastie; as his brother, Sir Patrick Hamilton, had in a conflict with another Frenchman. In Jan. 1508, a Scotish doctor had commented, at St. Paul's church, on the epistles of that apostle: ib. In May Sir Patrick Hamil∣ton, a most famous knight, vanquished an Irish gentleman of eminent skill in arms: and in June the bishop of Moray arrived, to solicit Arran's discharge; but he left London in July after an ineffectual embassy.</P>
<P>From Ayloffe's Calendars, p. 316, it appears that Sir Patrick Hamilton was also imprisoned, but permitted, on the 8th August, to revisit Scotland, on his oath to return if required; and that James earl of Arran, his brother, became surety for him on the 13th Aug.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE> To vindicate his conduct on this occasion, the English mo∣narch dispatched an envoy to his son-in-law.

<P>Meanwhile Aubigny, and another embassador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Mar.</NOTE> with a train of eighty horse, arrived in England from France, on their journey into Scotland<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">André de Tholouse, ib.</NOTE>.

<P>The Scotish monarch continued to indulge the splendor of his court, in frequent tournaments, and other expensive amuse∣ments. But his finances were at the same time more usefully employed in architecture, in ship-building, and in the impor∣tation of excellent breeds of horses, from various countries, especially Spain and Poland<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See the letters to the kings of these countries. Ib. 98, 99.</NOTE>. It is to be regreted that his treasury was too penurious to supply the demands of his mu∣nificence: and about this time, instigated perhaps by the ex∣ample of Henry VII, whose extortions under the conduct of Empsom and Dudley had become famous, James ventured upon new, and invidious, modes of raising money. Among others, by the advice, as is said, of Elphinston the learned bishop of Aberdeen, he had recourse to a plan not a little in∣jurious to the nobility, and land-holders. Some of the feudal usages of Scotland had, from their severity, fallen into long discontinuance: such were, the sovereign's right to the proceeds of an estate, during the minority of a proprietor, who held of the crown, except the necessary expences of his maintenance
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>and education: the resumption of lands by the superior, in case of any doubt in the title; or if the vassal sold half the estate; or if he allowed two terms to pass, without presenting the usual payment or acknowledgment to his lord. These, and similar dormant claims, were revived by James; and such was his popularity that scarce a murmur ensued; but the ge∣nerosity of his spirit soon shrunk from these extortions, which were dismissed in oblivion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 343, at the year 1505; Buch. XIII, 22. For many minute events of 1508, and the subsequent years, the curious reader may consult Lesley.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The art of printing, that art which preserves all the others, was now introduced into Scotland.

<P>This noble art had passed into Denmark in 1480; Sweden 1483: and was even to visit Iceland in 1529.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The death of Henry VII of England occasioned a deplorable change in the politics of that country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1509 22 Apr.</NOTE> with regard to Scotland, and other kingdoms. Henry VIII, to the usual ebullition of youth, added a disposition imprudent even to caprice, and haughty even to tyranny. Perpetually deceived by the con∣tinental powers, and ever open to new fraud, his reign was one scene of error; and would have met with the execration of his people, had not his very vices established the reforma∣tion, and its invaluable advantages, in England. James dis∣patched Andrew Forman, bishop of Moray, with compliments of condolence and congratulation, and with powers to obtain
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>a ratification of the alliance; which was soon after solemnly confirmed by the oaths of both monarchs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 262, 267. The commission of James, dated 22 July regni 22, may be found in Rymer, X, 376, erroneously ascribed to James I. The Scotish king demands a personal conference with his brother-in-law, which was refused by Henry, who was afterwards repeatedly in vain to solicit James V for the same purpose.
<P>The character of the bishop of Moray was most suspicious, and his prefer∣ments in foreign realms shew that he had repeatedly sold his king and country. In 1501, on concluding the marriage treaty, Henry VII gave him the abbey of Cottingham, Keith Bishops, 86; in the Epist. R. S. 110, it is erroneously called <HI>Coldingham in Anglia:</HI> Lindsay, 170, values it at 4000 angels a year. The avarice of Henry is well known; and the gift was certainly for some solid ad∣vantage, probably an abatement of the bridal dower. Forman had been pro∣tonotary to the infamous Alexander VI, Lesl. 333: and infinite art must have been used by him in securing the confidence of James, whom he always de∣ceived.</P></NOTE>. In the beginning of the following year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Aug.</NOTE> Henry also renewed the truce with France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 Nov.</NOTE> upon the model adopted by his father, which bore that it was to continue till one year after the death of the surviving king<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 270.</NOTE>. As almost every reign reverses the maxims of the preceding, so it is usual to defer any great alteration for a short space, that the change may not become dangerous by its sudden violence; and Henry's conduct towards Scotland continued, for the two first years of his reign, apparently ami∣cable.</P>
<P>Amid the barrenness of important events, it may be per∣mitted to mention the complaint of Margaret duchess of Savoy, governess of the Netherlands, to James, against the capture of some vessels by Andrew and John Bartons, who were after∣wards to furnish one source of the fatal dispute between Eng∣land and Scotland. But this remonstrance was erroneous, as is evinced by the answer of James: nor had the English per∣haps
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>any reason to impute acts of piracy to those naval officers<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 106.</NOTE>. The Scotish king continued to cultivate the amity of Julius II, who was now engaged with the emperor, France, and Spain, in the famous league of Cambray, against the Venetians: he had prevailed on that pontiff to confirm the donation of the archbishopric of St. Andrews, and the abbey of Dunfermline, to Alexander Stuart, his natural son, who was sent to improve his youth in the studies of Padua: and James now entreated the military pope to annex the priory of Coldingham to the abbey of Dunfermline, upon pretence that, as a frontier place, its prior ought to be a person of eminent power and secure fidelity<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 108, 109. Two elegant unprinted epistles of Panter to his disciple, the archbishop, at Padua, may be found in the MS. Reg. 13 B. II.</NOTE>. This request met with success; and tends in some degree to exculpate James III from a similar measure, con∣cerning that noted priory; but whatever the intentions of that prince were, his conduct upon the occasion was precipitate, and, with the violent effects of open despotism, hastened his unfortunate fate.</P>
<P>The war between John king of Denmark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1510</NOTE> and his Swedish subjects, still continuing, the Hans Towns, finding their advan∣tageous commerce with Sweden interrupted by the Danish corsairs, entered into the contest in support of the Swedes. Lubeck, long the chief of the Hans Towns, suffered much in this dispute, from its vicinity to Denmark, and applied to the emperor for his interference. Maximilian requested James, as the ally of the Danish monarch, to persuade him to abandon hostilities against the people of Lubeck, and to submit the difference to the imperial decision. The answer of James is respectful, yet firm: he represents that he, and the French king, had formerly mediated between the parties, but that a
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>brief reconciliation had been followed by war; that he shall not presume to judge which was the aggressor, and, in the uncertain justice of the cause, he had not sent any aid to Den∣mark; that Lubeck had acted haughtily, and, as was reported, had treated the Scotish merchants with cruel severity; and that the Danish king declined a reference to the imperial judgment, as the people of Lubeck were too persidious to abide by an equitable decision<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 112. Mallet, Abr. I, 176.</NOTE>. In the following year a peace was made, by which the Hans Towns were forced to sacrifice their Swedish allies<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mallet, 177, 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The pontiff Julius II had now formed an alliance with the Spaniards against the French; and the artful Ferdinand in∣stigated Henry VIII, his son-in-law, to join in a defensive con∣federacy; though he had recently renewed the league with France, as before mentioned<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Hist. of Henry VIII, sub anno. Rymer, XIII, 285, &amp;c.</NOTE>. James, probably aware of this transaction, made warm professions of friendship to Louis XII; from whose kingdom, in preference, he demanded permission for his subjects to purchase supplies of grain, unseasonable rains having frustrated the hopes of the Scotish harvest<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Epist.

The use∣ful, and the unnecessary, arts continued to divide the attention of James: his attachment to alchymy is palliated by his regard to the best alchymy of a sovereign, the discovery of the native wealth of his dominions; a foreigner was employed, though with small success, in exploring the mines of Scotland for gold<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See a curious letter from James, requesting the loan of some books of Al∣chymy from <HI>Mr.</HI> James Inglis, (apparently the celebrated <HI>Sir</HI> James Inglis, af∣terwards abbot of Culros,) Epist.

<P>Nor did James neglect his laudable cares in promoting the marine of his realm:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1511</NOTE> but, even in this department, he some∣times sacrificed utility to splendor. The construction of small vessels, to be employed in the national fishery, would have met with more applause from a philosophic historian, than the fabrication of that enormous ship, which, as is reported, Francis I and Henry VIII afterwards laboured in vain to ex∣ceed<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 167, Buch. XIII, 21.</NOTE>. This celebrated vessel was called the Great Michael; and was larger, and stronger, than any ship in the navies of England or France. The oak-forests in Fife, excepting that of Falkland, were exhausted in the construction, though much timber from Norway was also employed<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Scotland had been gradually denuded of wood, partly by the constant con∣flicts of families and clans, in which the woods were destroyed to prevent refuge or ambuscade, and partly, not to mention other causes, by domestic use. In re∣peated epistles James applies to foreign powers for supplies of timber. Epist. I, 39, to France, 137, to Denmark and Norway.</NOTE>: the carpenters, Scotish and foreign, used all diligence, under the frequent in∣spection of the king: yet a year and a day were necessary to complete the work. Length being still regarded as essential to a ship of war, while those intended for merchandize were as remarkable for short proportions, the Great Michael boasted two hundred and forty feet in length, while thirty-six mea∣sured the breadth: but the sides were not less than ten feet thick, and defied the rage of cannon. The expence was estimated about seven thousand pounds sterling of the time, then a very large sum, exclusive of the artillery. In the rude∣ness
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>of the art few cannon were yet employed, even in the largest vessels; and those of the Great Michael are only estimated at thirty-two, with three of inferior size<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Dr. West in his letter to Henry, 13 April 1513, after quoted, says that the Michael had SIXTEEN pieces of great ordinance on <HI>every</HI> side.

<P>In 1509 two large ships, accoutred for war, had been presented to James by Louis XII. Lesl. 353.</P></NOTE>: the abundance of small artillery was held to compensate this defect. The ma∣riners amounted to three hundred, the gunners to one hundred and twenty; and this vast ship could receive one thousand warriors. That this large body might not be destitute of soul, Sir Andrew Wood, and Robert Barton, men eminent in the naval records of Scotland, were among the officers: and from them Lindsay, the historian, derived the detail above given, so that its authenticity appears unquestionable.</P>
<P>A new, and greater, series of affairs now opens upon our view, which shrinks, when it perceives the approaching scene, tinged with the blood, and darkened with the calamities of Scotland. But while history presents the record of human misery, she teaches us to exult that a period has been assigned to the dissentions of two nations, formed for perpetual union.</P>
<P>The war, which was soon to arise between Henry and James, originated chiefly from the following incident. It has already been related that letters of reprizal had been granted to the Bartons against the Portugueze, in revenge of an injury suffered above thirty years before; but which the confined maritime
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>power of Scotland had saved from an earlier retaliation. Emanuel, king of Portugal, in vain remonstrated against these reprizals for so ancient an offence, and in vain offered a judicial examination of the affair, for he had, four years before, dis∣missed with neglect the Rothsay Herald, especially delegated by James to conciliate the dispute, and to restore the antient amity between the crowns<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For the mission of Rothsay see Epist. R. S. I, 91; and for the neglect of Emanuel, ib. 120. The demands of James were apparently too high.</NOTE>. That justice was on the Scotish side, and that Emanuel, after adding contempt to injury, and finding too late that he was mistaken in his estimate of the naval force of Scotland, had no claim to an amicable procedure, are circumstances of probable inference: yet there is some reason to believe that the Bartons abused the royal favour, and the distance and impunity of the sea, to convert this retaliation into a kind of piracy against the Portugueze trade; at that time, by the discoveries and acquisitions in India, rendered the richest in the world. Andrew Barton<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The name of this leader, as given by the historians, is evinced by the Epist. R. S. I, 147. The other two brothers were long afterwards celebrated.</NOTE>, the brother of Robert and John, with two vessels, the Lion, a large ship of war, and the Jenny Pirwen, an armed sloop, traversed the English seas; and interrupted commerce by not only capturing Portugueze vessels, but by rifling some belonging to England, upon pretence of searching for Portugueze goods. At least such were the representations of the English merchants; which had such effect that lord Thomas Howard, and Sir Edward Howard, sons of the earl of Surrey, and of a family afterwards to be repeatedly fatal to Scotland, were sent with two ships to encounter Barton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> After an obstinate and doubt∣ful conflict in the Downs, the death of the Scotish commander decided the victory in favour of his antagonists: the two
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>Scotish vessels were brought into the Thames, and retained as lawful prizes, while the crews upon imploring mercy were dismissed. Sir Edward Howard was, in the following year, created lord admiral of England; and Barton's ship, the Lion, had the honour of being the second ship of war in the English navy, the Great Harry built in 1504 having been the first; for till that time only merchant vessels had been occasionally used in warlike affairs. James enraged at this loss, and insult to the Scotish flag, which it had been his favourite study to advance, dispatched a herald to the English court: but the pride of Henry afforded no other answer than, that the fate of pirates ought never to be an object of dispute among princes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 355. Buch. XIII, 27, 28. Herbert's Henry VIII, p. 15, 16. Hall, f. 15. In his letter to the pope, 5 Dec. 1511, James complains of the English outrages by sea and land. Epist. R. S. I, 123. Yet no evidence re∣mains of remonstrances to England: the original papers and letters are pro∣foundly silent concerning Andrew Barton, whose acts of piracy were perhaps proved to James, and his conviction at once abandoned the cause. Perhaps it was left to the commissioners at the border-meetings.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A more minute cause of renewed enmity between the na∣tions arose upon this ground. Sir Robert Ker, a favourite of James, his chief cup-bearer, master of his artillery, and warden of the middle march, having been severe in the administration of the latter office, was slain by Heron, Lilburn, and Starked, three Englishmen. Henry VII who then reigned gave up Lilburn to the Scots, Starked escaped: but Heron of Ford, brother of the murderer, was also yielded, and imprisoned with Lilburn in Fastcastle, where the latter died. The two other assassins now beginning to appear, and to excite commotions, as if conscious of protection in the new reign, Andrew Ker, the son of Sir Robert, sent two of his adherents; and receiving from them the head of Starked, remitted it to be exposed in
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>one of the most public places of Edinburgh. Thus both courts seemed to connive at deeds of open violence<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIII, 26.</NOTE>. Nor must it be omitted that James found another cause of complaint, in the refusal of Henry to deliver a valuable legacy of jewels, which had been left to the Scotish queen by her father<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Our historians erroneously say her brother Arthur; but see many original letters after quoted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet Henry, who now joined the pope, the emperor, Spain, and other powers, in an active alliance against France, was willing if possible to preserve his dominions from a Scotish war;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> and sent embassadors to James with offers of satisfaction for any violations of the peace<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 309. See also his unpublished volumes, N<SUP>o</SUP> 4619, art. 19.</NOTE>. The Scotish king perceived the motives, and declined the offer, with so much the more spirit as an embassador had arrived from the court of France, with liberal presents and promises:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec.</NOTE> and, in his letters to the pontiff, James expresses the deepest, and most determined re∣sentment at the conduct of the English monarch<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>Amid the consideration of the progress of this unhappy dispute with England, the interference of James in the affairs of Europe must not be forgotten. In the endeavour to com∣pose the dissention between the pope and France, an unpre∣cedented object, and which greatly embarrassed the piety, and politics, of the Scotish court, James sent a commission to his uncle, the duke of Albany, the attainder of whose family was perhaps now reversed, as embassador extraordinary to the em∣peror, in order to request his mediation between Louis and Julius<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 124. From the transactions of 1514 it is very doubtful if any rever∣sal of the attainder yet took place. John the young duke of Albany had wedded a great heiress in 1505, and was considered as settled in France; so that James probably sent this commission at the request of Louis.</NOTE>. Andrew Forman, bishop of Moray, was sent for the
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>same purpose to France, to the college of cardinals, and to the marquis of Mantua: and this embassador had also the ho∣nour to pass as a conciliator between the pontiff and Louis; but without effect<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Epist.

Cordier, a French envoy, proceeded from Scotland to Denmark, in order to influence the Danish court: and to the entreaties of Ferdinand of Spain, who wished to engage James in the papal interest, it was answered by the Scotish monarch, and even by his queen, the sister of Henry, that the sole wish of Scotland was to establish the peace of christendom<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 129, 131, 133.</NOTE>. A wish amiable but vain: the war between France and the papal allies had commenced in the spring of this year; and so connected were now the affairs of the most distant European countries, that the pride of Julius II was to prove a cause of the death of the Scotish king.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the symptoms of an approaching rupture between England and Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1512</NOTE> these kingdoms were to con∣sume another year in fruitless negotiation. Henry wished to secure the neutrality of James, before he conducted his forces into France, that England might not be exposed to the danger of an invasion, during his absence: and James, whose finances and attention had been diverted to other pursuits, and whose subjects, during a long peace, had almost forgotten their mili∣tary toils, found it necessary to employ some time in preparation for war<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">In March this year James was suspected by Henry of entertaining a design against Berwick. For it is most probable that the letter from Henry to Darcy governor of Berwick, dated 10th March, Cal. B. VI, 75, was written this year, as Dacre's letter of 17th May, in all appearance 1514, B. II, 155, bears to have been written two years after James was about to <HI>steal</HI> Berwick, when Darcy being too covetous, Dacre was appointed warden of the eastern and middle marches. Henry desires Darcy to reinforce the garrison, and prepare to attend him with 500 men, "in our voyage to France this somer." Sir Ralph Evers (or Eure) had acquitted himself well; and Darcy's son had done service "at the late voyage against the said Scots." Darcy remained governor of Berwick, while Dacre was warden of the marches.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Amid the commotions of Europe it was thought proper that the assistance of Denmark, the ally of France and Scotland, should be demanded. For this purpose the Carrick herald was sent to the Danish court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 April and 28 May</NOTE> with instructions to represent the hostile views of England towards France and Scotland; and to enquire what aid might be expected from their ally<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>The English king again sent an embassy to Scotland, to negotiate a reciprocal remission of all offences against the pacification; and to require the oath of James for the observ∣ance of that treaty, while Henry offered a like oath in return<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The embassadors were lord Dacre, and Dr. West, whose second commis∣sion is dated 15 April 1512.

Of the 21st May appears a letter from James to Henry, requesting a safe conduct for the bishop of Moray, to pass through England for an universal peace. Cal. B. VI, f. 8. This Henry refused, though the requisition was repeated by James in July and October. See the letters after quoted.</NOTE>.
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>This proposal was fruitless. The ratification of the league with France, which had been so long delayed from complaisance to the English monarchs, was now, at the instance of La Motte the French embassador, solemnly performed by James<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The preliminaries were signed on the part of James at Edinburgh, 6 March 1511—12, regni 24.

The chief variation from the pre∣liminaries is in art. 5, which instead of bearing as before, that Scotland shall make no treaty with England except France be comprehended or refuse, now expresses that Scotland shall make no treaty except by consent of France. The ratification by Louis XII is of the 12th Sept. 1512, Abere. II, 526, from the original. His commission for completing the alliance may be found in Cal. B. VI, f. 27; it is dated 22 May 1512.

It bore, that whereas the former leagues had been directed against England, the present should infer mutual co-operation, and that personal, if the occasion required, against all who may live and die: so that Scotland, in the assistance of France, should now war against the pope, the emperor, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Venice, and Switzerland. Much French gold must have been expended in procuring this extravagant concession, so foreign to every dictate of common
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>prudence. The pope, dispirited with the defeat of his allies in the battle of Ravenna, endeavoured to amuse Louis and James by the proposals of a peace, in order to direct the arms of christendom against the Turks<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>Yet James continued his labours to establish the peace of Europe, though at the same time he ordered general musters throughout his realm: and lord Sinclair was nominated cap∣tain of the ship called the Great Michael, while lord Fleming obtained the same charge in the Margaret<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O.

This letter also bears that a Flemish ship, laden with Scotish goods, had been taken by the English, and carried into Berwick: Dacre advises its restoration, and he shall endeavour in return to obtain those taken by De la Motte, Robert Barton, and David Falco∣nar, whom he calls pirates. De la Motte returning to Scotland in June 1512, after sinking three English vessels, captured seven, and brought them to Leith. Lesl. 357.
<P>In Sept. 1512 La Motte returned to France, and revisited Scotland in No∣vember.

<P>Nor must it be omitted that on the 18th July [1512], James had sent repeated letters to Dacre and Henry, complaining that Falconar's ship had been sunk, and himself sent prisoner to London, Cal. B. VI, 60; and that the Scotish merchants had suffered many injuries from the English, who called themselves "the pope's men," ib. 65. But he offers to send the bishop of Moray, as his embassador to Henry, provided the safe conduct extend to his passage abroad. James promises peace and redress, if Henry shew similar intentions; and he hopes this will be the case "nochtstanding small differencyis betwix ws." As to De la Pole he rejects his cause, as alike injurious to himself and Henry. Ib.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the desgning Ferdinand had persuaded Henry to send a large body of troops to Fontarabia, in the expectation of acquiring Guienne to the English crown: but the Spanish monarch used the terror of their arms to conquer Navarre for himself: and then made a truce with France, leaving his allies
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>to act at their discretion<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Mezeray, ib. Herbert, 21, 22.</NOTE>. This remote expedition appears not to have excited much apprehension in the Scotish court, which only granted letters of reprizal to Robert Barton, in consequence of which he captured thirteen English vessels<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 357.</NOTE>. Some incursions were also made on the marches, in virtue, as appears, of similar letters; which, by a special clause in the pa∣cification, had been permitted, in case that either party should complain of unredressed injuries. Yet Henry, urged by these appearances of war, gave a commission to the earl of Surrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Aug.</NOTE> appointing him lieutenant general of the marches; with orders to array the fencible men of the northern counties, in opposi∣tion to the Scots<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 339.</NOTE>.

Virg. lib. XXVII, p. 629. Epist. R. S. I, 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The movements of James were however eagerly watched, and a review of his fleet excited an alarm approaching to that of war. Henry having ordered Darcy, governor of Berwick, to impart what he could discover concerning the intentions of the Scotish king, that peer informed his sovereign that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Aug.</NOTE> ac∣cording to the report of a spy, James intended to command

With De la Motte, who now again returned to France, James sent Walter Ogilvy, charged to propose to Louis that the same annual sum should be paid to him as had been assigned to Henry from France, for Scotland had not funds sufficient to maintain an expensive war.

<P>Finding his negotiations with Henry in order to procure peace to France ineffectual, James sedulously prepared for war.

<PB N="83" REF="89"/>and she would induce James to pacific measures. West pro∣ceeds to relate that the bishop of Moray was to go to Italy, to congratulate Leo X, the new pontiff: that the Scotish king declared that he would not make war, without sending a herald, so that if Henry went to France, as he intended, he might return to defend his own kingdom: that to the offer of one thousand marks, made by Henry, if James would consent to an abolition of all claims, that prince answered with scorn that he did not want money, and would not sell his effects. James said that Henry had nominated a successor to the crown of England, to his prejudice, who was the nearest heir; but this West, as authorized by his instructions, solemnly denied. The Scotish king persisted in his romantic design of a voyage to Jerusalem; and shewing to West the advantageous terms offered by France, he urged that by the assistance of Louis alone could he perform his holy expedition. To the chief purport of West's embassy, which was to enquire if James would consent to observe the peace in the absence of Henry, it was answered that appearances must be saved with France, but that if England would offer the same terms they would be considered. The duplicity of this proposal West justly sus∣pected. To the modest demand of the Great Michael made by Henry, James replied that he might command all his ships, on condition that he made peace with France<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. West to Henry, 1 April, B. VI, 56. James regularly attended his chapel every forenoon in his <HI>traverse,</HI> (retired seat with lettice,) and Margaret was as formal; "when the passion was preched, and the sermon doon, the quene sent for me." James saying he must appeal from Henry's judgment, West asked to whom, and the monarch replied laughing, "I shall appeal to Prester John." He complained that the English commissioners on the borders only trifled; and that Drury said on the bench, that no Scotish ship should sail the sea without being taken; so much had Robert Barton's numerous captures irritated the English. Henry was so mean as to offer to pay the legacy left to his sister, by their father, if James would consent to peace; scornfully rejected: the king declaring that he would pay the sum to his wife himself. The arch∣bishop of Glasgow, the earl of Argyle, the secretary, and Sir John Ramsay, were appointed to confer with West. If James procured peace, France offered to him a tenth of her revenue, (a <HI>disme</HI> of the realm.) The bishop of Moray failed to France on the 31st of March; (see a letter of that date, sent with him, to Maximilian, misplaced in Epist. R. S. I, 298.)

<P>The second letter dated from Edinburgh bears that the pre∣parations for war continued, and De la Motte was daily ex∣pected from France with provisions for the Scotish fleet:<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 April</NOTE> that the secretary of Scotland had confessed that the last brief from Julius had more inflamed the mind of James, than all the French embassies, and the king declared that, if that pope had lived, he would have supported a council of even three bishops against him<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>West had nevertheless prevailed with James to consent that a meeting of commissioners from both nations should be held in the following June<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 358.</NOTE>. But this meeting came to no deter∣mination; and the English commissioners desired a delay till the 15th of October, with the approbation of Henry and his council<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Letter James to Henry, in Hall and Holinshed's chronicles.</NOTE> James, in his letter to Henry, soon to be narrated, blames the English monarch for frustrating the intention of this conference: but while it is granted that Henry's caprici∣ous pride, and puerile ambition, prevented him from sacri∣ficing his enmity to France, and even from treating his spirited brother-in-law with deserved attention; it must also be allowed that the arts of France prevailed more and more over James, till they violently conducted him to his own destruction.</P>
<P>These invidious arts were chiefly guided by Andrew For∣man bishop of Moray, the embassador of Scotland at the French court; a man of versatile talents, long busied in the subtilties of negotiation, and who, with an unprincipled cun∣ning, pursued his own advancement, often at the expence of his country. Two years after this period, he is solemnly ac∣cused
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>in a letter from the government of Scotland to the pope, of having incited his sovereign into the ruinous war terminated by his death<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 209.</NOTE>: and he must certainly have been an insincere statesman who was at once a favourite of his deluded master, and of the courts of London, Paris, and Rome. Had his sphere been as extensive as that of his contemporary Wolsey, he might have shone with all his guilt and glory. Like that fa∣mous minister, he blended his private avarice and ambition with every foreign negotiation: the concessions made to Eng∣land, the treaty of perpetual peace, procured Forman the rich priory of Cottingham; the sale of his king and country now acquired to him from France the archbishopric of Bour∣ges; his devotion to the papal interest was soon to obtain that of St. Andrews<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. passim. Keith, &amp;c. In 1509 Forman in his embassy to Henry VII, with strange duplicity, permitted the title of king of France to pass among those of the English monarch: Rymer, XIII, 261, 267; a circum∣stance which occasioned to James the embarrassment of a formal protest.</NOTE>. The miseries of nations so often originate from profligate statesmen, while their unhappy sovereigns sus∣tain the blame, that it is the peculiar duty of history to unfold the infamy of ministers. Forman's repeated epistolary per∣suasions<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIII, 30, "literis crebris Andreae Formanni." Add Lindsay, 171. The praise of this bishop by those authors is truly ludicrous. They wrote in complete ignorance of his character.

Denmark sent some ships laden with arms: and O Donnel, the great Irish chief, visited Edinburgh to offer his homage, and instigate James against England. Ibid.</NOTE>. But his most valuable
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>freight, if we believe Henry's reproaches to James, consisted of crowns of the sun, a golden coinage of France, which he profusely distributed to the Scotish king, and courtiers. The character of James had been well studied by La Motte, and was completely known by Forman, so that it was now touched with a masterly hand; for letters, written in an amorous strain, appeared from a high-born damsel in distress, the queen of France, to this prince of chivalry, in which she termed him her knight; and, assuring him that she had suffered much blame in the defence of his honour, beseeched him to advance but three steps into English ground with his army, for the sake of his mistress. The artful queen, Anne of Bretagne, who died a few years after in her thirty seventh year, at the same time sent to James fourteen thousand crowns; and, what ought to have been more valuable to an errant knight, a ring from her own finger<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 171, 172. Buch. XIII, 25.</NOTE>. An exquisite sensibility of honour was the peculiar foible of James, as it was to be of his successor, and proved in different modes fatal to both. Hence the reproaches of Anne, which refer to the inactivity of James, after the league of last year, and perhaps to the intervening negotiations with England; and hence the insolent remonstrance, con∣tained in a letter of Forman's at this period, in which he assured his king that his honour was for ever lost, if he did not assist France, as Forman had promised in his name<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Iidem ib.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there was another point of honour to be considered; for a defect in which the English warmly accused James, though with no great degree of justice. This was the rupture of the perpetual peace; to the observance of which both kings had solemnly sworn. Yet there was nothing in that treaty exclusive of an alliance between Scotland and France; and
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>it was especially agreed that either party might assist an ally against the other, provided there was no invasion permitted of each other's dominions: in their subsequent letters, James, and Henry, betrayed improper warmth; but the power, which first radically infringed the perpetual peace, was that which first invaded the territories of the other; and in this it is sus∣pected that James was to blame: for if any petty English in∣vasion preceded that by Home, as our historians pretend, it might, like other limitary insults, have been revenged by let∣ters of reprizal, in conformity to the grand pacification<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Arran's invasion of Ireland in July was confessedly unauthorized.</NOTE>. But in this point that celebrated treaty was so little adapted to the contingencies of real practice, that no political scheme could secure it from violation: it was the work of churchmen, and to statesmen, warriors, and mankind in general, presented some objects, and methods, impossible in the accomplishment. To a candid enquirer the caprice, and haughtiness, of Henry will appear as immediate a cause of the war, as the prevalence of the French interest at the Scotish court: James may well be acquitted of any criminal infringement of a conditional oath; but he must be charged with rashness, and want of prudence. The conduct of Henry VII to himself should have been the example for that of James to his youthful brother-in-law; but the character of the Scotish monarch was unhappily as impetuous as that of his antagonist.</P>
<P>Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 June</NOTE> having sent a large and gallant army into France, soon after proceeded to take the command in person<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 36, 37. On the 24th of May 1513, James sent an important letter to Henry, the original of which is extant in Cal. B. VI, f. 67. He in∣forms his brother-in-law that France having concluded a truce with Arragon for one year on the 1st of April last, she desired James to accede, if Henry would; and he offers any terms of peace. The death of admiral Howard, (April 25, Herbert 31,) he regards as a loss to Henry, never to be compensated by the ac∣quisition of French gallies; and he adds that such able officers should be em∣ployed against the Turks. He expresses the deepest regret of himself and his queen for the fate of that gallant man, as they were both well acquainted with his father [Surrey,] "the noble knicht, quha convoyt oure deerest fallow the quene unto ws." Deeply pathetic, when it is considered that, in a few months, this noble knight was to slay him in battle!</NOTE>; and the
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>ruin of that kingdom seemed inevitable; for, to judge from preceding events, if the English had formerly subdued France by the aid of the duke of Burgundy, what must be their success when assisted by the emperor, and the house of Austria, of whose extensive domains those of Burgundy now formed only a province? Alarmed for the safety of his ally, apprehensive, as he pretended, for his own consequent fate, the Scotish king ordered his fleet to prepare for sea. James Gordon of Letter∣fury, a son of the earl of Huntley, was appointed admiral; and he was ordered to conduct the earl of Arran with about three thousand troops into France<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 359. Lindsay, 171, seems more justly to regard Arran as both admiral and general. Yet Gordon was perhaps a seaman, and high admiral of Scotland at the time. Lindsay adds that lord Fleming was vice admiral in the Margaret, and lord Ross of Halket commanded the James.</NOTE>. The number of ships, in this sole fleet of war which Scotland ever equipped, is not specified by our careless writers: apparently it did not exceed twenty; but the smallness of the number was compensated by the strength and size of some of the vessels, among which the Great Michael, the Margaret, the James, are especially commemorated<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The original letters of the commencement of the reign of James V throw some light on this subject.

<P>Lindsay, 171, tells the story with unsuspecting simplicity; Buchanan XIII, 25, confirms his account: and Sir David Lindsay, hist. of Meldrum, Scotish Poems, London 1792, Vol. I, p 150, seq. puis the affair beyond all doubt.</P></NOTE>. Whether his motives for this depredation were to revenge some injuries done to his people of Arran, by the inhabitants of the opposite Irish shore, or to ingratiate him∣self with France by committing Scotland as a principal party in the war, must be left to conjecture. It appears, from au∣thentic Scotish evidence, that the sack of Carrickfergus was conducted with great barbarity; for the poet Lindsay has cele∣brated, in strains far from fanciful, the actions of William Meldrum of Binus, a Scotish gentleman present in this expe∣dition: and he represents the town as having been abandoned to an almost total conflagration; his hero's merit is displayed by protecting even priests and friars from the soldiery; and his first adventure consists in the deliverance of an opulent virgin from robbery and violation<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lindsay's Squire Meldrum, <HI>ubi supra.</HI></NOTE>. After this exploit, Arran passed to Air, to lodge his spoils in safety. James, justly enraged at the delay, ordered Sir Andrew Wood to proceed with a he∣rald
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>at arms, in order to supersede the admiral, and appointed Angus to command the forces: but the Scotish fleet had sailed for France before the mandate arrived<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIII, 25. Lindsay, 172. Charters to Wood appear in Scotst. Cal. in 1526 and 1528: he must have attained a great age.</NOTE>. Of the actions of Arran's troops nothing is recorded: nor was there any conflict, except the skirmish at Guinegat, called the battle of spurs, have a claim to that title. Henry captured Terouenne, and Tournay, and returned. Next year a peace was concluded; and Louis wedded Mary, the sister of Henry<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Herbert 37—51. Mezeray, Abr.

Louis however settled a pension for life on Arran: and, in September, issued letters of general naturalization in France, to all the people of Scotland. To this grateful measure he was instigated by the representations of Forman, bishop of Moray, the Scotish embassador, and of Robert Stuart lord of Aubigny, captain of the Scotish guard: the record adds, as the chief reasons, the assistance of the Scotish peers to France in the reign of Charles VII, who first elected a guard from their countrymen; and the tried fidelity of the nation, espe∣cially on the present occasion, when James had, in opposition to his own brother-in-law, sent a considerable body of troops, and a fleet of many good ships to assist the French<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Abercr. II, 528, from a copy in the earl of Winton's possession.</NOTE>. Arran returned to Scotland, in the month of November: the fate of the fleet was obscure, a part sailed back, and mouldered in neglect; while a part was sold to France; in particular the Great Michael, which was purchased by Louis XII on the 2d of April 1514, for forty thousand livres, from the duke of Albany, in the name of the Scotish government<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>Having thus accompanied the maritime expedition, from its commencement to its termination, it is necessary to return to more fatal events by land. On the day that his fleet sailed, James dispatched his chief herald, with a letter to Henry, now about to form the siege of Terouenne. It is said that this message was not unknown to the Scotish parliament, which had been induced by the royal influence, and by the intrigues and gold of France, to consent to an English war; but this seems a dubious and vague assertion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Compare Buch. XIII, 30, with Lindsay, 172.</NOTE>. In this remarkable letter, James recapitulates the affair of Andrew Barton; the protection given to Heron, the assassin of Ker the Scotish war∣den; and the detention of the legacy of Henry VII to his daughter: he adds the slaughter and captivity of some Scotish gentlemen; the delay of redress; and Henry's contempt, in refusing a safe conduct to an embassador from Scotland though intended to be sent at the request of West his own envoy. James, lastly, states the bonds of amity between himself and France, from which realm alone he could expect aid if injured, and on which the wanton attack of Henry could not fail to excite a similar apprehension for Scotland: and in a sentence, which might have been modified, he insists on Henry's return to his own dominions<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The letter itself in Hall, 5 H 8, Holinshed, III, 1481; Cal.

Lest. 361.</NOTE>. This retort little contributed to appease Henry's wrath; who sent a letter full of indignities, which never reached the eye or ear of James, as the herald was not able to procure a passage from Flanders, till after the death of his master<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. ib.</NOTE>. The chief topies of reproach were, that James, with the persidy of his ancestors, intended to break the peace solemnly sworn; that he had awaited Henry's absence, before his intentions were declared; that his want of faith being known, England was prepared to receive him; that he ex∣pected the crown of that kingdom, but Henry should so order, that neither he, nor his descendants, should wear it. The English king solemnly denies that he refused a safe-conduct to the embassador: and rejects with disdain, to admit James as the judge of his quarrel with France, or at his desire to desist from the war<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 382. Cal. B. VI, 49. Hall and Holinshed <HI>at supra.</HI></NOTE>. These singular manifestos, though impassioned, and unlike those of more modern times, yet explain rather the pretences than the causes of enmity.</P>
<P>Henry certainly regarded the letter of James, and not un∣justly, as a declaration of war: but it is impossible that an incursion could be made into Scotland, in consequence of this letter, before the 13th of August, as some of our historians pretend; and that such an inroad was at all effected seems more than dubious. However this be, lord Home, who had a few years before succeeded his father as chamberlain of Scot∣land, and was moreover warden of all the marches, arrayed
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>his followers to the amount of three or four thousand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Aug.</NOTE> marched into England, rifled and burned seven villages, or hamlets, on the borders; and collected considerable spoil<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 361. Buch. XIII, 29. Hall, 5 H 8. Holinshed III, 1483. Her∣bert, 42.

Had it happened in 1512 the numerous original re∣monstrances could not have been silent.</NOTE>. That this in∣cursion was made with the permission of James seems evident; but what intention it could serve, except to put the English upon their guard, before the royal army entered into their country, is inexplicable. The success of Home was speedily reversed. Sir William Bulmer had been sent from Doncaster by the earl of Surrey, with two hundred archers on horseback, to defend the marches from minute infractions: that officer now called to his assistance the gentlemen of the English border, who, with their followers, swelled his band to the amount of near a thousand. Placing themselves in ambuscade among some tall broom, in the plain of Milfield, they suddenly surprized the Scots in their return, loaden with plunder. The victory, as usual, fell to the English archers, whose sharp and continuous discharge slew five or six hundred of Home's people: their leader fled, and lost his banner, leaving his brother Sir George Home, and more than four hundred of his followers, captives: the prey, amid which was a great number of English horses, was resumed by the conquerors<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesley, 361, says the action happened in the pass of Broom <HI>house,</HI> (so he interprets <HI>Agr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Genistae:) probably Broomridge near Milfield.

<P>James, in opposition to the advice of his council, had al∣ready summoned the whole array of his kingdom, embracing every province, and even the isles, to meet him at the Burrow∣moor,
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>on the south of Edinburgh, within twenty days, ac∣commodated with the usual provisions for an expedition of forty days<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 172. Drummond, 144, observes that the Burrow-moor was "a field then spacious, and delightful, by the shades of many stately and aged oaks."</NOTE>; beyond which time a feudal army was not bound to serve, except its expences were discharged by the sovereign, a case yet unknown in Scotland. As no Scotish monarch had ever been more popular, the array was great, though the people was not insensible that the war was imprudent: and by the confession of domestic, and the testimony of extraneous, record, not less than one hundred thousand men crouded to the banner of James<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 175.

<P>Meanwhile the defeat of Home, who seems to have been permitted to make his excursion during the gradual assemblage of the host, with an erroneous view perhaps of inspiriting its hopes, by the previous prospect of success and plunder, not a little clouded the mind of the king<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 172, says James was "very sad and dolorous."</NOTE>. Some of his wiser courtiers, knowing him as prone to superstition as to romantic adventure, availed themselves of his melancholy, to introduce a mode of dissuasion from his intended expedition, only adapted to the man, and to the age. As James was performing his devotions in the church of Linlithgow, a grave personage, with a bald fore-head, blue gown, linen girdle, and sandals, probably representing Saint Andrew, the patron of Scotland, preceeded boldly to the royal seat; and, with the awful voice of celestial authority, warned the king of the deplorable fate of his expedition: nay, if we believe an eye-witness, this pretended vision added a stern caution against the king's at∣tachment to vague amours, as leading to his certain ruin; a
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>circumstance not prophetic of his destructive dalliance with Mrs. Heron, but which leads to suspect that the queen was not inconscious of the plot<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 172, 173.

But prudence and superstition united their powers in vain: and equally fruitless were the caresses, and tears, of Margaret the queen, who besought her husband, if he must war with her brother, at least not to conduct his forces in person; but to look upon his infant son, and reflect that on him alone rested all the hopes of his parents, and of an affectionate people<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lindsay 175.

It is believed that Carlisle, New∣castle, Durham, or York, might have fallen with as much ease as this strong, but to the Scots useless, castle: and the fame, and opulence, of such an enterprize held forth very different ani∣mation to the army. Returning up the banks of the Tweed, James took the castle of Wark, or Carram, situated above Coldstream, on the opposite side of the river; then proceeding to the south-east, he ventured a few miles further into English ground, and took the castles of Etal, and Ford; names before unknown, and enterprizes worthy of a border-chieftain<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

At Ford the king found Mrs. Heron, whose husband was still a pri∣soner in Scotland, and not exchanged for sir George Home<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib.</NOTE>: the royal warrior was at once dissolved in indolence, and love; while his natural son, the archbishop of St. Andrews, became the paramour of Miss Heron the daughter<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 176, Buch.

It may be averred that many irretrievable days were wasted by James at Ford; for Surrey found, and defeated him, at Flodden, where his army lay on the opposite side of the Till, within a mile or two of Mrs. Heron's enchanted castle. In a romance such a circumstance would appear impossible; but much is true, which has no semblance of truth; and thus was past
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>the time, which used to convey a Scotish army to the gates of York, and return it loaden with spoil.</P>
<P>While the king pursued his amorous dalliance, his numerous array, confined to the barren extremity of England, began to find provisions fail; and was exposed to continual rains, among the upland heaths, and cloudy mountains. Oppressed more∣over by a tedious delay, so inimical to the spirit of a soldier, the leaders and men began to execrate an enterprize, which employed weeks to accomplish the objects of hours. Some there were, who had acquired spoil and captives, and were desirous to exchange danger for enjoyment. From these, and other causes, the Scotish host gradually melted away, till there remained not above thirty thousand; a disproportionate number of whom consisted of lords and gentlemen, prevented by con∣siderations of honour from following the vulgar example<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 176, says there only remained ten thousand, besides "borderers and <HI>countrymen,</HI>" that is men of the southern counties.

<P>On the other hand, the earl of Surrey, lieutenant general of the northern counties of England, lost no time in his pre∣parations to oppose the Scotish king.

Immediately upon this junction, Surrey sent a herald to James offering battle on the friday following: and, to his
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>father's reproaches, the admiral added that, having in vain sought the Scotish fleet by sea, he was now ready to assert the justice of Andrew Barton's fate in the van of the English army<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib.</NOTE> These defiances were intended to arouse the charac∣teristic spirit, and resentment, of James, and thus induce him to combat with a diminished and disheartened army, at the will of the English leader: nor did they fail of their proposed effect, for the Scotish king accepted the challenge, in the very circumstances that Randel and Douglas had refused that of Edward III<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib.</NOTE> Some of his peers remonstrated against this imprudent step, particularly the earl of Angus, whose great age and experience ought to have secured respect; but James only answered, "Angus, if you are afraid, you may go home."

<P>Nevertheless James supposing that the hill of Flodden, on the opposite side of the Till, presented a more advantageous post for his army, than the level situation of his camp, he removed, and took possession of that fatal ground<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The castle of Ford was burut by James IV, and not repaired in 1542. See a survey of the borders of that year, Cal. B. VIII, f. 63. Had such papers been known to Redpath, he might have composed a far more interesting work, than his injudicious history of England and Scotland, intitled the Border History. This destruction lends probability to Lindsay's tale, that lady Ford betrayed James: and that she passed between him and Surrey is clear from Hall.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Sept.</NOTE> This hill is the last, and lowest, of those eminences which extend on the north-east of the mountains of Chevior, towards the vales of Tweed, from which river it is distant about four miles. The ascent from the Till, which runs north by the declivity on which Ford stands, is about half a mile in length: and a
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>bridge across the Till rendered the passage easy. On the south of Flodden extends the capacious plain of Milfield; embraced on the west by high hills branching from Cheviot, on the north by Flodden and other eminences, on the east and south by rising grounds, beneath which the Till winds its slow and solemn way<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Almost the words of Redpath, 488, who surveyed, in company with Dr. Percy, most of the scenes of the Scotish and English conflicts on the borders.</NOTE></P>
<P>Surrey learning this movement of the Scotish army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Sept.</NOTE> and being now advanced to Woolerhaugh within five miles of Flodden, he endeavoured again to provoke the pride of James, by sending a herald to reproach him for leaving his ground; and to challenge him to abandon his heights, and try the fortune of war on Milfield plain, the following day, between the hours of twelve and three. But the king's imprudence extended not so far: he even refused admittance to the herald<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">C. Surrey's letter, 7 Sept. five in the afternoon, Cal. B. VI, 73; and Stow, 493, Hall, ib.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Finding this scheme fail, and that it was necessary to bring the Scots to battle, or retire, as his army began to want pro∣visions, in a barren and ravaged country, the English general, with great skill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8 Sept.</NOTE> proceeded to a decisive measure. Passing the Till, he advanced through rugged grounds on its east-side, and encamped, for the night, at Barmore-wood, about two miles from the Scotish army. An eminence on the east of Ford, shaded the English from observation: and from this height the admiral reconnoitred the Scots, who discharged a few cannon. Next morning the English wheeled to the north west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 Sept. Friday.</NOTE> and crossed the Till near its confluence with the Tweed; the van∣guard and artillery over the bridge of Twisel; the rear by a ford, about a mile above that bridge. Having thus come
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>behind the Scots, by which mean there was an easy access to Flodden-hill, and a battle was rendered unavoidable, the English advanced in full array towards the enemy<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib. Buch. XIII, 37. Lest. 363.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is evident that James was ignorant of every duty of a general, when he permitted the accomplishment of these movements: he might have repeatedly attacked the enemy at disadvantage; in the rear, when marching through the rugged grounds; or divided when passing the difficult ford of the Till. But he had not even a suspicion of this countermarch; and had only ordered a battery of cannon on the east side of Flodden, to defend the bridge between Ford and his camp<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The vestiges yet remain. Redpath, 490.</NOTE> To the former causes of discouragement in his army, he now added persistence in defence; while to attack might have been half a victory.</P>
<P>The Scots, suddenly perceiving the English in order of bat∣tle, set fire to the huts of their camp, and hastened to take possession of a northern eminence near Brankston, which might have proved an advantageous post for the enemy, who had now passed the brook of Sandyford<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The village of Brankston is to the north-west of the hill of Flodden, and distant between one and two miles.

<P>The best account is to be found in Hall, who however errs, when he sup∣poses that Huntley was with Lennox and Argyle; for Dacre, in an original letter to the council of England, Cal. B. II, 155, mentions that, (after Sir Ed∣mund's division was defeated by the Scotish left,) he with his cavalry encountered <HI>Huntley and Home,</HI> and there fell of the Homes Sir John, Cuthbert of Fastcastle, the heir of Sir David; with many of their friends, as Sir William Cockburn and his son, the <HI>larde</HI> of Blacater, William Ker, and three Bromfields bro∣thers: while Dacre's brother Sir Philip was taken, and many of his kinsmen and followers slain.</P>
<P>Lindsay gives no arrangement of the battle, but slightly narrates, 181, 182, that Huntley and Home had the van, (the left with having advanced first, a circumstance which has embarrassed the narrations of the Scotish historians ac∣customed to regard the right wing as the van.) Lesley's arrangement is, on the <HI>right</HI> Huntley and Home: <HI>left</HI> Crawford, Montrose: <HI>middle</HI> King, Argyle, and Lennox. Buchanan's, R. Huntley, Home; M. King; L. Lennox, Argyle. That of Paulus Jovius, R. Huntley; Crawford, Montrose; M. King; L. Home, Lennox, Argyle, Hall's minute account of the battle sufficiently evinces the fallacy of these deseriptions. Lennox and Argyle, for instance, were attacked by Stanley; while Huntley and Home assailed Sir Edmund Howard; and Craw∣ford and Montrose were defeated by the admiral's division: and in the arrange∣ment of the English all our historians agree.</P></NOTE>. The English cannon did some exe∣cution, before the armies encountered.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
<P>At the hour of four, in the afternoon, the battle commenced. The admiral, perceiving the Scots descend in four large bodies, armed with long spears, requested his father to extend, and strengthen, the van, by drawing up the middle division on its left<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Scotish pikes are compared to the <HI>Moorish</HI> by Hall. This minute writer says that the admiral sent the Agnus Dei from his breast, as a token to his father to advance. Hall probably received the circumstances from the ad∣miral himself, duke of Norfolk, 1524—1554.</NOTE> Sir Edmund Howard was then encountered by Huntley and Home, and his division thrown into great disorder, till Dacre advanced his cavalry in its support: but the admiral, now joined by Dacre, routed, and slew, Crawford and Mon∣trose. The king's battalions opposed those of Surrey; while Stanley on the left wheeled round the eminence, and attacked in flank Lennox, and Argyle, who being slain, their battalions were totally routed. But the Scotish historians say that the undisciplined highlanders, under the latter two nobles, rushed down the hill, though La Motte and other French officers ex∣erted themselves to prevent this fatal step, and by their conse∣quent discomfiture occasioned the calamity of the day; Stanley attacking them in the rear, a measure generally decisive of an engagement.<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Buchan. XIII, 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James had altogether forgotten his characters of monarch, and general; and rushed on with the illaudable valour of a
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>common soldier. While the English leaders, conscious of their duty and importance, preserved a station, from which they could discern, and direct, the actions of their bands, James, and his nobles, dismounted; and struggled in the front with the mass of English bill-men. In this vain, and inglorious, contest many Scotish peers fell; but Bothwell and his reserve advancing, and valiantly supporting the king's attack, the standard of Surrey was endangered. At this critical moment that part of the left wing, which was led by Crawford and Montrose, being routed, Huntley having fled, and Home's battalion being thus separated, and apparently obliged to stand on the defensive against the cavalry under Dacre, the admiral advanced his division, and assailed in flank that of the Scotish king, and the reserve under Bothwell, which had bravely ad∣vanced in his support. James fell amid heaps of his warlike peers, and gentlemen; being pierced with an arrow, and mortally wounded on the head with a bill. Though Stanley, having dispersed the right wing, now pursued their tract, and came upon the rear of the Scotish centre, it still maintained the shock; and, arranged in the form of a circle, disputed the victory with surrounding enemies, till the approach of night terminated the conflict.</P>
<P>As Home's band had defeated a part of the English army, and the Scotish centre had not retired, Surrey was uncertain of the victory, till the returning dawn discovered that the field was abandoned by the foe<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Compare Hall's interesting detail with the more summary accounts of Lind∣say, 182, 183; Buch. XIII, 38; Lesley, 364. Polydore Virgil, lib, XXVII, p. 641, observes that if James had fought more cautiously, or his people had been eager to revenge his fall, the English would have been defeated.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the celebrated battle of Flodden, the only one in which a Scotish king had fallen, since the time of Malcom III.
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>The generous and valiant peers disdained their lives, in the defence and revenge of their sovereign; and perhaps no con∣flict in history displays such an effusion of noble blood. The archbishop of St. Andrews, a natural son of James, whose promising youth was honoured with the eulogy of Erasmus, was a victim on this occasion, along with other church-men of rank, George Hepburn bishop of the Isles, and the abbots of Kilwinning and Inchaffray. Of the nobles were twelve earls; Crawford, Montrose, Lennox, Argyle, Errol, Athole, Mor∣ton, Cassils, Bothwell, Rothes, Caithness, Glencairn; besides thirteen lords; and five eldest sons of peers. The gentlemen of high rank, and chiefs of families, amounted to about fifty. Of the common sort it may be computed, by assuming the middle between the diminutions of the Scots and exaggerations of the English, that about ten thousand were left on the field<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">In a tablet on the monument of Surrey, afterwards Norfolk, (Weaver's Fun. Mon.) the number is computed at 17,000. Polydore Virgil more justly puts 10,000 Scots, and 5000 English. He resided in England, 1510—1550.</NOTE>. On the English side hardly a gentleman fell, for the battle was as usual chiefly decided by the English archers: but the loss of the soldiery might amount to four thousand.</P>
<P>In the night of the battle, Home's followers, chiefly free∣booting borderers, pillaged some of the slain; and their leader has been much calumniated by some Scotish historians, as if he had stood aloof, while he might have lent effectual aid to his sovereign; nay some charge him with the assassination of James, when he had passed the Tweed, in his flight from the field. But the reports are so vague, and contradictory, that they de∣serve no credit. The impartiality of the old English writers allows that Home's division dispersed that of his opponents; a merit ascribed by our historians to Huntley, who was among
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>the first that fled<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">For Huntley's flight see Hall. For Home's brave resistance, and great loss, the letter of Dacre above quoted. Yet Polydore Virgil blames Home.</NOTE>. The English cavalry appear to have sepa∣rated Home's division, and forced it to stand on the defensive, till the conflict was nearly decided: perhaps the followers of that peer, who had suffered so much in the late ambuscade, might think they had done their duty, and refuse to renew the charge. It is impossible to perceive from the past, or subse∣quent, conduct of Home, what advantage he could hope from the death of a king, who highly favoured him and his family: but it is easy to discern that Home's power excited great jealousy during the ensuing regency, and that his enemies ex∣erted every art to blacken his character, before the regent was instigated to put him to death.</P>
<P>Surrey, contented with his victory, did not advance into Scotland. The body of James was discovered by Dacre, and was carried to Berwick, where it was recognized by Sir Wil∣liam Scot, and Sir John Forman, his confidential servants, who had remained captives. It was afterwards interred at Shene or Richmond, by the special permission of Leo X, as James had died under a recent sentence of excommunication, for infringing the solemn pacification with England<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Hall, ib. Dacre, in his letter above quoted, says that he found the body of James, (whom he must have well known from his late embassies to his court,) and after informing Surrey by writing, brought it to his presence at Berwick: but how he was treated on the occasion by one Langton of Berwick, is, he adds, well known but not yet punished. The fables of our historians concern∣ing the fate of James are beneath all notice. A curious anecdote, concerning the disposal of the body, may be found in Stow's Survey of London, p. 539, extracted by Sir David Dalrymple in his Remarks on S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hist. p. 152. For the bull of Leo see Rymer, XIII, 385.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO event more immediately calamitous than the defeat at Flodden darkens the Scotish annals. Shrieks of despair resounded through the kingdom. Wives, mothers, daughters,
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>rushed into the streets, and highways; tearing their hair, in∣dulging all the distraction of sorrow, while each invoked some favourite name, a husband, a son, a father, a brother, a lover, now blended in one bloody mass of destruction. While the pleasing labours of harvest were abandoned, while an awful silence reigned in the former scenes of rural mirth, the castle and the tower echoed to the lamentations of noble matrons and virgins; the churches and chapels were filled with me∣lancholy processions, to deprecate the divine vengeance, and to chaunt with funereal music the masses of the slain. Nor, amid the pangs of private distress, was the monarch forgotten: the valiant, the affable, the great, the good; who, in an evil hour, had sacrificed to precipitation a reign of virtues; who in the vigour of his life had fallen in a foreign land, and whose mangled body was the prey of his enemies. The national sorrow was heightened by terror at the scene which seemed ready to open, of servitude, and of ruin. France, itself en∣dangered, could afford no aid: the English monarch might little regard the ties of blood, but might wrest from his infant nephew a kingdom left defenceless by the loss of its peers and best warriors. Even now the philosopher, and the historian, may regard this crisis as the most fatal which ever attacked the prosperity of Scotland. The reign of James IV is allowed to have been the period of the highest national success, and a summit, from which the public fortune was gradually to de∣cline, till, in the present century, it again began to ascend. The defeat at Flodden, the death of the king, left the country a prey to foreign influence and intrigue, which continued till Scotland ceased to form a separate kingdom: her finances were exhausted; her leaders corrupted; her dignity degraded; her commerce and her agriculture neglected. Henceforth her historic page aspires little to glory; but still continues deeply
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>to interest by the peculiarity, and variety, and even by the tragical nature, of its events.</P>
<P>The fifth James was not a year and a half old at the time of his father's death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He was born <HI>about</HI> the 16th of April, as appears from a letter of Magnus, Cal. B. VI, f. 333, mentioning that at Easter 1525 James would attain the age of thirteen. In the Epist. R. S. I, 142, date <HI>du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cimo</HI> as the MS. not <HI>undecimo;</HI> Easter happened on the 11th of April, so that the birth of James is fixed to the 10th of April 1512, by that letter, p. 141.</NOTE>. The long minority, about to be deli∣neated, is remarkable for internal intrigue; and particularly for the fixed establishment of the French and English factions in Scotland, which were to continue more or less to distract that ill-fated kingdom, till the close of its existence as a sepa∣rate state. For many reigns preceding the tyrannic interfe∣rence of Edward I, Scotland had been devoted to the English interest; and her kings, ignorant of the fabulous alliance with France, had regarded those of England as brothers and friends. When Edward's rash policy, and destructive actions, had ruined all confidence, the connexion with France commenced: and though David II, and James I, discovered some attachment to England, the peers and the nation may be regarded as con∣stantly blending their interests with those of France, and as being even blindly zealous for that country. The impolitic conduct of the English sovereigns had not a little contributed to this effect, by continual exasperation, and frequent war. But on the dawn of more refined policy in the northern king∣doms of Europe, they were at length to perceive that persua∣sion is more powerful than force; and that the sums expended in fruitless war might be used to real advantage, by the regular pay of a party, so as to assume the government of Scotland without the envy attached to open conquest; or at least to balance the similar arts of France, and, by dividing the coun∣cils
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>and strength of that small state, render its force ineffectual. The ambition of the emperor Charles V, the spirit of the monarchs of France and England, Francis I and Henry VIII, now about to produce some of the most important events in modern history, contribute to render the factious intrigues prevalent in Scotland at this period interesting, as connected with the general history of Europe. The abilities, and fame, of the actors also conspire to render the spectacle illustrious. This new scene is about to open on the reader with singular advantage: the motives, councils, events, and characters, being now, for the first time, to be pourtrayed from the letters of the principal persons concerned; which are very numerous<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">They fill nearly six large folio volumes, in the Cotton Library, Caligula, B. I, II, III, VI, VII, and part of B. VIII. This treasure, to the disgrace of our history, had not been before explored: great attention was indeed ne∣cessary, as they remained a chaos without even dates, till the author affixed them on the margin. It is still to be regretted that the arrangement is completely un∣chronological. The days of the month are always put by the writers, but the years were only to be evidenced by intrinfic circumstances, and often by numerous collateral proofs, in which Rymer's noble collection afforded great assistance.
<P>It may not be improper to repeat that O. implies original, and C. copy.</P></NOTE>, and display such original and multifarious materials, that, on comparing the sequel with preceding histories of this reign, the reader will discover almost their constant error, or imper∣fetion. The detail of English policy may perhaps surprize; as it will be seen that Cecil was only the imitator of Wolsey, and, as it appears from the originals, even consulted the dis∣patches of the cardinal as documents for his own procedure. These previous remarks will, it is hoped, not be found unne∣cessary to prepare attention, and to introduce with due illus∣tration the subsequent narrative of the minority of James V.</P>
<P>To give the solemn sanction of inauguration to the infant sovereign, and to arrange the plan of government, must, from
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>the indispensable importance of the objects, and in imitation of former precedents, have necessarily attracted as early care, as was admissible by the regular forms, and time required to summon a parliament. It is certain that a national council accordingly met at Perth<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Original letter, Dacre to the bishop of Durham, 29 Oct. 1513, Cal. B. III, 11; and another, B. III, 235, dated 19 Oct. from which last it appears that Margaret had been declared Regent, an office only to be conferred in parliament. The first quoted letter mentions a council as having met at Perth, evidently a national one; the royal coronations were usually performed at Scone in the vici∣nity of that city. Lesley dates this parliament 21 Dec. at Stirling: Buchanan at the same place, 22 Feb. Both are mistaken, for the parliament did not again meet till March, and was prorogued till May; O. Dacre to Henry, 10 March 1514, Cal. B. VI, 48; and same to same 8 April 1514, B. III, 25. Lindsay is nearer the truth, when he asserts that James V was crowned twenty days after the battle of Flodden.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">about 15 Oct.</NOTE> and though our historians unac∣countably vary in their dates of the king's coronation, and this parliament be to them unknown, it may be concluded that a ceremony, which it would have been imprudent to have delayed beyond the usual space, was now performed.</P>
<P>In the fatal battle of Flodden most of the Scotish nobility had perished, and the council which urgent necessity summoned to Perth, may be supposed to have consisted chiefly of the emi∣nent clergy. To secure their concurrence with the queen's measures, several bishoprics and abbacies were assigned, or pro∣mised<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Henry, 13 Nov. 1513, Cal. B. VI, 37.</NOTE> Yet the members departed without any determination concerning the government of the kingdom; they only ordered that the castle of Stirling should be well fortified, and the com∣mand given to lord Borthwick, with the important charge of the infant monarch<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> It seems however to have been agreed that the queen-mother should hold the reins of government, according to her late husband's will, till a fuller parliament
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>should proceed to the appointment of a regency; for that of a woman was unknown in Scotland, and of dubious success after the failure of the widows of James I and his successor; that of an English woman, invidious at all times, was yet more to be feared during a war with England. The English faction was yet to form; and the French began to murmur, and to think of the duke of Albany, John the son of Alexander ba∣nished by his brother James III, and who was undoubtedly next heir to the monarchy, if the progeny of his cousin James IV should fail. But this prince remaining in France was distant from their vows; and the recent example of Ri∣chard III of England occasioned some terror at the prospect of committing royal children to the charge of their uncle. Nor would it have been prudent further to have irritated Henry VIII, by manifesting any disrespect to his sister at this crisis; not to mention that the queen interested the wishes of the people by her situation, being in the third month of her pregnancy, and, as it proved, of a son, Alexander duke of Ross<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Not Rothsay, as some of our historians, a title sacred to the eldest son of the monarch: the coeval letters unanimously style him Ross.</NOTE>, who was born in the following April, but died in his second year.</P>
<P>The royal widow appears to have merited, and possessed, the admiration of all ranks; and as she continues to occupy much attention, during the various and stormy scenes of this long minority, some account of her character may not be here improper. Margaret was now in her twenty-fourth year; and her youthful beauty and graces rather proclaimed the bride, than the widow. Her circular countenance displaying gaiety, her vivacious eyes, her person rather rustic than delicate, were accompanied with a corresponding vigour of health<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">A good whole length portrait exists at Hampton-court.</NOTE> Her amorous propensities were strong; and were to be indulged at
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>the expence of ambition and decency, in precipitate marriages; and, if we believe her brother and Wolsey, in yet bolder devi¦ations<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See the year 1521.</NOTE> But eminent in accomplishments, and in prudence when unbiassed by her passions, her talents throw her faults into the shade. Her long letters<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">They often fill ten, or twelve, folio pages, wholly written with her own hand.</NOTE> display an intimate know∣ledge of affairs, and characters, considerable ability, and patient industry. In her political conduct she was not free from the levity ascribed to the sex, and was apt to pass from one extreme to another; and, when in power, alternately to display too much pride or too much humility, and severity too stern or a gentleness too relaxed. Yet the times were difficult; and that wisdom could not be mean which attracted the praise of the able Dacre, of the prudent and magnanimous Surrey, and of the cautious cardinal<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In various letters which passed among those three eminent persons, to be found in the above collection.</NOTE>, a praise not to be suspected of flattery, because neither pronounced nor known to the object.</P>
<P>The aristocracy of Scotland was at this time so much di∣minished, and weakened, that the queen's attempt to gain the regency was not so arduous, as it might have proved at another period. The peers, who amounted to about forty at the close of the late reign, were now reduced to nearly half the number, by extinction or by nonage. In a meeting of the states, some time after this period<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 509: 15 May 1515.</NOTE>, we only find the names of Angus, Argyle, Arran, Errol, Morton, Eglinton, Home, Sempil, Ross, Erskine, and Yester. Among perhaps an equal number absent on this occasion, Huntley and Crawford deserve parti∣cular
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>mention, being the most powerful lords in the north, as Angus and Home were in the south.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the war with England continued to desolate the Scotish borders. The deputies for the magistrates of Edin∣burgh, who were themselves in the field of war, published, the day after the battle of Flodden, a spirited proclamation, ordering the inhabitants to prepare for defence, in consequence of a melancholy rumour which had arisen; and prohibiting the women to spread dismay through the streets, by their tears, shrieks, and lamentations<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">It is published by Sir D. Dalrymple in his Remarks on the Hist. of S. p. 147. George Touris was vice-provost, ib. The family of Touris (Towers) of Innerleith often occurs in Scotstarvet's Calendars, from the reign of James I. In 1538 the family seems to have passed to Bristol in England, (perhaps as pro∣testants,) for, in that year, a charter of part of Innerleith is granted by George Touris of Bristol.</NOTE>. New and dreadful was the epoch which called for such a mandate: but the apprehensions were vain, as Surrey unexpectedly dismissed his army. His mo∣tives for this conduct remain unexplained: his force was cer∣tainly weakened by the conflict, and he was perhaps unwilling to commit his signal success to the envy of chance: yet the want of provisions and ammunition seems to have formed the chief obstacle; and attending fleet having been always found necessary to victual the English army in invading Scotland; repeated experience having taught the Scots to withdraw their cattle, and stores, into distant heights, woods, and wilds. Henry, engaged in a war with France, could not spare a naval force; but with eager commands and reproaches he excited lord Dacre of the North, warden of the eastern marches, to frequent inroads. This nobleman was alike emi∣nent in warlike prowess, and in political talents, and was to act a most important part in the minority of James V, being,
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>as it were, a deputy for Henry and Wolsey, in the manage∣ment of the English interest in Scotland. His papers fortu∣nately remain; and not only unveil his art and industry, but convey the most authentic historical materials for many facts, before misrepresented or unknown. Home, who was the chamberlain of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Oct.</NOTE> and at the same time warden of the marches, met Dacre in order to negotiate for the ransom of some English prisoners; but Home was at this time warmly inimical to the English interest, and the meeting was followed by no effect, save repeated incursions into Scotland<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to the bishop of Durham, dated Carlisle 19th Oct. 1513, Cal. B. III, 235.</NOTE>. The waters being swelled with rain prevented Dacre's former in∣tention of leading four thousand men into the Scotish borders; and, as was usual on these occasions, he was forced to await a certain age of the moon, before he led his men to toils and to prey, which the shortness of the day might have rendered unsafe or ineffectual<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> Some small, but destructive, inroads were however made<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Hostilities continuing with England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1514 Jan.</NOTE> Andrew Brownhill, and Antony D'Arcy lord de la Bastie, proceeded on an em∣bassy to Denmark, in the name of the Scotish and French monarchs, to represent the distressed situation of Scotland, and to solicit from their Danish ally subsidies of men and ammu∣nition<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Epist.

To add to the embar∣rassments of Scotland, the emperor, being in alliance with England, interdicted the Scotish commerce with his dominions. Dacre not only continued to infest the borders with repeated incursions, but retained several spies in Scotland, to enable

Great was the public disorder; and the council of state was in vain frequently assembled, for the young peers opposed the prudent resolves of the aged<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. A parliament was fixed for the twentieth day of March<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, but the council postponed it to the fifteenth of May, after or∣daining that the castles should be given to the custody of cap∣tains chosen by them. Crawford was appointed chief justice beyond the Forth, and Home to the same high office in the south. A bill for the duke of Albany's restitution to his pa∣rental estates was given in, and read, but not decided: nor were the difficulties small, for, among others, the lands of March had been assigned as a part of the queen's jointure. Yet Ilay herald was sent to invite Albany to assume the re∣gency, apparently with the assent of the queen, who was dis∣gusted with the vain exercise of an authority merely nominal; and, was moreover not indisposed to the French interest, as some propositions had arisen which indicated that Louis XII designed to demand her in marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April</NOTE> in order to secure a peace with England<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">All these particulars, so remote from historical accounts, are from O.

<P>Albany's arrival was delayed by the French monarch, as his government in Scotland might have proved an obstacle to
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>the treaty negotiating between England and France. The public expectation of his regency was great, and it was re∣garded as the sole remedy which could terminate the disorders of the kingdom.

<P>Amid such violence of party the public confusion was in∣creased by a variance which arose between Home and the youthful earl of Angus, who had just succeeded his grandfather in that potent title, his father having been slain at Flodden.

<P>To the surprize and regret of all ranks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Aug.</NOTE> Margaret hardly recovered from the languor of childbirth, suddenly wedded the earl of Angus<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 370.</NOTE>, instigated in all appearance solely by the ef∣fervescence of amorous inclination; for this precipitate step was ruinous to her ambition, as of itself, by the royal will, and by the law of the country, it terminated her regency. In the progress of time however various incidents will contribute to restore her power; and she continued to attract great at∣tention by the splendor of her birth and former station, by the art of her intrigues, and the boldness of her talents. The nobility of Scotland were, at this period, little remarkable for natural abilities, and far less for those which depend on learning; the clergy had engrossed all that belongs to ac∣quired knowledge, and political capacity; but among the Scotish nobles Angus was perhaps the most uninformed, and unfit for his dangerous elevation, for his royal marriage prompted him to assume much of the vacant government, and the queen's fondness seconded his ambition. Experience, and maturer age, will display him in a different light; but at this time his years, and his instruction, partook of puerility<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In a letter to the English council, 7 Aug. 1515, B.

A birth distinguished by an ancestry of heroes, opulent possessions, a potent vassalry, above all a person blooming with youth and elegance, transported the woman, while they ruined the queen; and bitter and speedy was the repentance.</P>
<P>A treaty was at length completed between England and France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Aug.</NOTE> and cemented by the marriage of Louis XII to Mary the sister of the Scotish dowager. Scotland was to be in∣cluded, if upon a notification of the peace she testified a desire to that effect; but if the Scots invaded England after the
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>15th of September, before which date the notification was to be made, the comprehension was to become null<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 419.</NOTE>. No inva∣sion took place, but petty incursions continued to be made by the Scots; and it was not till the following May that they for∣mally accepted the treaty; the internal confusions, the diffi∣culty of adjusting the affairs of the marches, the knowledge of Henry's pacific intentions, the sudden death of Louis XII, deference to Albany, and repeated expectations of his arrival, affording various and successive causes for this delay. Add to these that the terror arising from the recent disaster had past away; and the nation was animated with a fruitless desire of revenge.</P>
<P>The Scotish kings maintained their privilege, or prerogative, of appointing to the vacant sees and abbacies the objects of their own choice, notwithstanding the papal pretensions usurped in some other countries. Repeated letters to the pope, and senate of cardinals<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 197, 204, 207.</NOTE>, concerning the new appointments now necessary, supported the royal claim; though they allowed the consent of the popes to be an indispensable form to complete the election. The vacant dignities were thus assigned: the metro∣politan see of St. Andrews to William Elphinston the learned and celebrated bishop of Aberdeen, the bishopric of Aberdeen to George abbot of Holyroodhouse; the abbacy of Holyrood∣house to him of Cambuskenneth, the latter dignity to the bishop of Caithness, Arbroth to Gawin Douglas, Dunfermlin to James Hepburn, Inchaffray to Alexander Stuart, Glenluce to the bishop of Lismore or Argyle, Coldingham to David Hume, all persons of eminent families<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 199.</NOTE>. The letters to Leo X are addressed in the name of the king, and of the queen dow∣ager
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>as "testamentary tutrix of the king." As the ecclesi∣astic dignities presented almost the only path to opulence, the commerce of the country being confined, and its pursuits little known to persons of rank, it is no wonder that warm contests had arisen concerning the promotions.

Albany now de∣manded Dunbar castle, as a part of the earldom of March, which was infeoffed to Margaret with the exception of that important fortress, justly regarded as a key of the kingdom.

He was probably appointed chancellor in the parliament of July; and was to act a distinguished part during this minority. An additional insult to the queen arose from the election of Hepburn, prior of St. Andrews, to that eminent see, by the chapter; though Margaret had eagerly supported Gawin Douglas, her uncle-in-law. The servants of Douglas had even seized the archiepiscopal castle; but were besieged by Hepburn, whose claim was favoured by most of the nobility, at this time, (if we only except the family of Angus,) unanimously inimical to the queen, and to the English interest. Angus rode with two hundred horse to rescue the castle<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. and letter Margaret to Henry, 23 Nov. before quoted. Never was there so much tumult in Scotland, says Dacre, "which pray God continue."

<P>Of the parliament, proclaimed to be held on the twelfth day of March, no record appears, except a slight notice of Lesley the historian, who informs us that a national council met about this time, but such were the dissentions that it was agreed to postpone it till the arrival of Albany now daily expected, for Sir John Stirling of Keir had landed from France with a message of that purport<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 375.

The distracted state of that country pre∣vented any attack on England: and Henry was now using arts which open force would only have defeated. So successful were those arts that Albany's government was undermined,
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>before it was established; and two years of constant inquietude were to terminate his first residence in Scotland, in the cha∣racter of Regent. It has already been related that Huntley had acceded to the queen's party; and the arts and offers of Dacre now determined Home to embrace the same measures. The articles offered to this nobleman by Margaret yet remain<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. II, 226.

Home warmly embraced the English interest; and his enmity to Albany brought him soon to the scaffold. It ap∣pears that Albany had long before used the power of a regent, and had disgusted some of the nobles by not granting their de∣mands. D'Arcy de la Bastie, a knight of valour and talents, had remained in Scotland as a delegate of the future regent; and many were averse to this influence of a foreigner.</P>

In a letter from the council of state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 May</NOTE> in the name of the infant king, to the French monarch, this in∣clusion is received with great spirit: the council assert that Scotland, after its recent loss had resumed courage, and, hoping revenge, had never even mentioned a truce; but that to please Francis and the pontist, and promote the proposed war against

<P>Great was the general expectation of Albany's presence; and the delay of a year had raised that expectation to eager de∣sire. His arrival was fondly longed for, as the sole remedy of the public disorders, as the sole pledge of a tranquillity, so much the more happy as it was to succeed the darkest tempests of anarchy. The young, and the turbulent, were not averse to the novelty; the old, and the peaceable, sighed for the pro∣tection and stability of a regular government. This event at length happened. Albany arrived at Dunbarton on the eighteenth of May with eight ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 May</NOTE> apparently part of the fleet of James IV, laden with ammunition, and warlike stores, and with yet stronger implements of government, the gold and luxuries of France<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Buch.

<P>As soon as the forms would permit a parliament was assem∣bled at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 July</NOTE> where the first care, after the restitution of his honours and estates, was to inaugurate Albany in the re∣gency, a ceremony performed with invidious splendor. A sword was delivered; a crown was placed upon his head; and the peers paid solemn obeisance, while Albany was, with mar∣tial music, proclaimed Protector and Governor of Scotland, till the king had attained the age of eighteen years, that is till April one thousand five hundred and thirty<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to the Council of England, 1 Aug. 1515. B. II, 281.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John duke of Albany, son of that Alexander who has been seen attempting to wrest the Scotish sceptre from his brother James III, whom he termed a bastard, cannot be supposed to have been warmly attached to the royal race; and there were not wanting some whose malice already saw the crown of Scotland on his head, tinged with infant blood<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Margaret's Information, 1516. B. VI, 105.</NOTE>. But such a prospect probably never existed, save in the jealous eye, or wanton calumny, of faction. His character is so mixed, that it is very difficult to delineate it with precision. To Surrey and to Wolsey he appeared a coward and a fool, as they bluntly express their sensations<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Particularly Wolsey, who in a letter to Surrey, 1523, Cal. B. VI, 218, says Albany, "is known to be a coward, and a furious and wilful fool."</NOTE>; and his government in Scot∣land, so inconsistent, so constantly foiled in every scheme, rather seems to warrant the harshness of the appellations. Yet Francis I, a good judge of merit, was afterwards to em∣ploy him in important affairs: when that king was before Pavia, in 1525, Albany was to be detached with a part of the army to conquer the kingdom of Naples, an enterprize de∣manding a general of supreme talents, but the defeat and cap∣ture
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>of Francis rendered the plan abortive<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini lib.

Les Francois en sçauroient bien que dire, quand de devant Pavie Monsieur d'Albanie emmena la fleur et la force du camp."</NOTE>: in 1533, when that monarch was to meet the pontiff Clement VII at Marseilles, Albany was to be distinguished by the appointment of conducting by sea Catherine de Medici, the destined wife of Henry, second son of the king, afterwards Henry II; an office at least implying confidence and favour, and a brother of Albany was, according to Guicciardini, created a cardinal upon occasion of that service<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lib.

II, 356.</P></NOTE>. The friendship of Francis I is itself a recommendation: yet an intimate acquaintance with the actions and papers of Albany may authorize the following character of his government. It was artful yet weak, profuse yet unfriended, tyrannic yet inefficient: while love and attach∣ment were estranged by caprice, fear and awe were not sup∣ported by uniform rigour: opiniative obstinacy disconcerted the prudence of friends, and prevented the conciliation of enemies. A stranger to the arts of empire, Albany, whom just policy ought to have transformed into a complete Scotishman, never forgot his French birth; and the haughty vanity of that nation, which he displayed without a veil, yet further disgusted the
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>Scots, a people then from remote situation, and want of in∣tercourse, inimical to foreigners, when they beheld their re∣gent surrounded with French officers and confidents, and heard him submit to term the king of France his master, an epithet he frequently used even in his dispatches<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VI, 136, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>; nor was the very signature of his name in French regarded as a trifle<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">He always subscribes JEHAN, or JEHAN R.</NOTE>. Even his private faults contributed to disgrace him. Surrey, in a letter to Wolsey, mentions upon the authority of Dacre, that the regent was so opiniative, that no counsel but his own was followed even when among his familiar friends; and his wil∣fulness was such that, upon the slightest contradiction, he would throw his bonnet into the fire, in which mode of argu∣ment he had consumed near a dozen of those missive syllogisms. Surrey adds, with the prophetic eye of skill, "if he be such a man, with God's grace, we shall speed the better;" a predic∣tion soon fulfilled<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. Surrey to Wolsey, 8 Oct. 1523. Cal. B. VI, 315.</NOTE>. Of Albany's person little is remarked: even his age is unknown; though he appears to have ex∣ceeded his thirtieth year. His mother was the daughter of the earl of Bologne, his father's second wife<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">She seems again to have married, after Alexander duke of Albany was slain, whence the French uterine brother of the regent.</NOTE>; but by the first, a daughter of the earl of Orkney, a son was alive, Alexander Stuart, educated to the church, commendator of Inchaffray, afterwards abbot of Scone, and bishop of Moray. The re∣gent had himself been married in 1505 to Anne de la Tour, sole heiress of the county d'Auvergne, the maternal aunt of the future Catherine de Medici<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">L'Art de Verifier les Dates, p. 726, 860. The learned Du Chat, in his notes on Rabelais, III, 65, observes that Albany had no children by his wife, "Anne de la Tour, dicte de Boulogne, Contesse d'Auvergne, et de Laura∣gais; fille de Jean III Conte d'Auvergne, et de Jeanne de Bourbon. Il eut pour niepce, du coté maternel, Catherine de Medicis Reyne de France, fille de sa belle-soeur, Magdeleine de la Tour, duchesse d'Urbin."

<P>When Albany assumed the regency, the most powerful peers in Scotland were Angus, Huntley, Arran, Home, Argyle, and Lennox. Angus was yet young and unexperienced; Huntley continued to be regarded as the chief leader in the north of Scotland, till his death in 1524; Arran, though possessed of large estates and vassalage, and strengthened by his connection with the royal blood, was a nobleman of mean talents; and Dacre considers Home in the same light, and undervalues his power<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">O. Clarenceux to Wolsey, 18 Feb. 1516, B. II, 298.</NOTE>, though so much exalted by some of our historians; his unresisted fall shews that what influence he ever possessed rested chiefly in the favour of his late sovereign. Argyle and Lennox commonly acted in concert, and their extensive feudal authority in the west of Scotland gave them great weight. But cultivated talents, and application to state affairs, had elevated many churchmen to eminent stations in the govern∣ment. The important office of chancellor was enjoyed by James Beton archbishop of Glasgow; that of treasurer, the third in the kingdom, was filled by Cuthbert commendator of

Off. 369.</NOTE>: Gawin Dunbar archdeacon of St. Andrews was lord register: and the avaricious primate Forman had crowded so many benefices and advantages into his own possession, that Albany was soon after constrained to divide them, in order to appease the universal outcry<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Less. 381.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The parliament, which had assembled at Edinburgh, was contented with enacting a statute to maintain the antient free∣dom, privileges, and immunities of the Scotish church; and another, punishing the master or maintainer of a robber, in the same manner as the culprit, upon a refusal to yield him to law, an ordinance extorted by the preceding disorders<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 112.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Haughty and severe measures marked the commencement of Albany's government; and he resolved to impress his ene∣mies with terror, instead of winning them by conciliation, a method which his caprice was obliged afterwards to adopt, when it was too late, his preceding rigour having sown seeds of an enmity, too wide and deep ever to be eradicated. Had his frown been that of impartial justice, it would have been laudable, as necessary to awe an aristocracy, and nation, from long anarchy deaf to the mild voice of the law; but it was the queen, and the houses of Angus and Home, his personal enemies, not those of public order, against whom the thunder of his power was directed. Hardly was the rod of regency put into his hands before he committed the venerable lord Drummond, maternal grandfather of Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 July</NOTE> and constable of Stirling castle, a close prisoner to the fortress of Blackness; upon pretence that a year before Albany arrived he had struck the lyon herald on the breast, who brought to the queen a message from the lords connected with Albany<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to the Council, 1 Aug. 1515, B. II, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>81. C. Margaret's De∣claration 1516, B. VI, 105. Lesley, 376.</NOTE>. Margaret
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>accuses the herald of insolence; and as the king was in her hands, and the herald's authority dubious, the zeal of Drum∣mond might have been sufficiently punished by a reprimand. Nor had the abilities and disappointments of Gawin Douglas any weight with the regent, who accused him of soliciting the bishopric of Dunkeld, through the influence of the queen and Henry with the pope; and sent him to the durance of the sea-tower at St. Andrews<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dacre, B. II, 281.</NOTE>. In vain did the queen, to use her own words, present herself at Holyroodhouse before Albany, "sore weeping," and intreating mercy for her counsellors Drummond and Dunkeld: her tears and supplications met with cold neglect, and she returned to the castle of Edinburgh, in which she now resided, as being a part of her enfeoffment, amid solitude and consternation. For her other counsellors, excepting only Angus and Home the chamberlain, and even many of her servants, now withdrew in terror<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. Margaret's Declaration, 1516, B. VI, 105.</NOTE>. The royal children were yet with her; but an attempt was soon made to deprive her even of this maternal consolation.</P>
<P>The regent directed that the shires and towns should be ruled by the usual magistrates, as in the reign of James IV; yet the English influence was excited even to distract this sa∣lutary design, and Henry exulted in disturbing where he could not command<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dacre to the Council, B. II, 281.</NOTE>. Hence the national tranquillity was little better established during the regency of Albany, than in his absence; and the general hope and wish were soon disappointed. The council of England had desired Dacre to procure, by the influence of Home or some other great lord, an embassy to be sent to England concerning a lasting peace; and at the same time to use every art in order to prolong the dissentions be∣tween Albany and Angus, and by inventions to raise jealousy
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>and suspicion between Albany and Home, so that the latter might be more and more firmly attached to Angus and the English interest<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to the Council, 1 Aug. 1515, B. II, 281.</NOTE>. Dacre not only succeeded in these mea∣sures, but began to win other Scotish nobles disgusted with the regent's haughtiness, or neglect; and the baton of Albany, entwisted with thorns, was soon to torture his rash and un∣skillful hand. In vain did he feign amity to England, in vain did he stoop, on the return of the Unicorn herald, even to proclaim the peace himself, to continue as long as France and England should maintain their treaty; while the people smiled to see their governor appear in this new character, at the cross of Edinburgh, and by the voice of trumpets announce his own neglect of his dignity<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though certain lords had long before been appointed by the council of state, as already mentioned, to whose custody the king was committed, yet the royal children remained in the queen's care, to whom the lords guardians were subordinate, as no mandate had been issued by parliament to withdraw them from their mother, whose tender attentions formed the best security of their infant health and welfare; nor had the power of the queen and Angus been so enfeebled as to render such a mandate, if it had been given, of easy execution. It was not only a most important object in itself for Albany to get pos∣session of the king and his brother, as the surest pledges of power, but the clandestine negotiation for conveying them to England, which certainly did not wholly escape the regent's ear, authorized the attempt; and had they even been sent to France, as it happened to the infant Mary in her subsequent reign, the long concord between that country and Scotland rendered such an event not illaudable; whereas between
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>England and Scotland there had been continued enmity; and a treaty, a ransom, degrading conditions, must at least have been necessary for their restoration. Accordingly the regent induced the national council, still assembled at Edinburgh, to name eight lords<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This natrative is wholly derived from the long and interesting letter of Dacre, last quoted.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">about 22 July</NOTE> from whom Albany, or lots, selected four; and from these four the queen was to chuse three, having, in other words, the power of rejecting any one whom she most disliked. These three peers were to have the custody of the king and his brother, wholly independent of the queen; and under no appointment nor controul, except of the parliament, or rather of Albany. The four peers proceeded from the parliament house to the castle of Edinburgh in due solemnity, amid a concourse of people assembled to behold this new and grand scene; a queen, a mother, surrendering her children to the representatives of the nation. On their approach the gates were thrown open; and the people beheld with sympathy and admiration the young and beautiful queen, standing at the entrance with the infant king by her side, his hand locked in hers; behind was the nurse with the other royal babe in her arms; around appeared Angus, and a few attendants. The shouts of acclamation having ceased, and the parliamentary delegates being near, Margaret, with infinite grace and majesty, exclaimed to them aloud, "Stand. Declare the cause of your coming." The peers, answering that they were sent by the parliament to demand their king and his brother, were struck with awe and confusion when the queen's command resounded, "Drop the portcullis!" This massy grate of iron being in∣stantly let down, between Margaret and the astonished dele∣gates, she thus addressed them: "This castle is part of my enfeoffment, and of it by my late husband the king was I made
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>sole governess; nor to any mortal shall I yield the important command. But I respect the parliament, and nation; and request six days to consider their mandate; for of infinite con∣sequence is my charge; and my counsellors now, alas! are few." She then withdrew; and the peers retired, penetrated with amazement, when they beheld such youth and beauty attended with such spirit and prudence.</P>
<P>As soon as this grand scene had passed, Angus, apprehensive lest, by disobeying an order of the regent in parliament, he might have forfeited his life and his lands, took notarial in∣struments, that he had desired that the children should be furrendered<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. On the fifth day thereafter the queen signified her request, that the king and his brother might be left in her charge, on condition that she maintained them on her dowry; or, if this might not be granted, she desired that they might be committed to the custody of Angus, Home, the Earl Mar∣shall, and Sir Robert Lawder of Bass<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As she justly expected that neither of these demands would win compliance, she had, in the mean time, withdrawn with her children from the castle of Edinburgh, a city in which she had no strong influence, to that of Stirling her usual residence, and a town which in course much favoured her cause. Albany secure of the support of the parliament, now by favours and French gold wholly at his devotion by a decided majority, while, as usual in Scotish par∣liaments, the minority did not attend, resolved at all events to accomplish this important design. He mustered all the men of Edinburgh, capable of arms, and desired them to be ready to follow him on the shortest notice: meantime he sent the lords Borthwick and Ruthven, with their followers, to remain in the town of Stirling, and prevent any victuals from passing
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>into the castle<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The dissolution of the parliament only in∣creased his arbitrary proceedings against the queen's friends. Angus was now in the county whence his title was derived; and Archibald Douglas his uncle, who had wedded an opulent widow of Edinburgh, was at Douglas castle; but Sir George Douglas, brother of Angus, remaining at Edinburgh, Albany maliciously ordered Home, now provost of that city, to arrest him; which that peer refused, as not being decreed by parlia∣ment, and said that the office belonged rather to a herald than to him. Sir George however fled to the Merse: and Home, the same night, retired, attended only by one servant, to a house of his near the borders called Newark. The indecent spleen of the regent prompted him even to command Angus, on his allegiance, to march his bands to Stirling, to blockade his own wife; an order, as being impossible to obey, worthy of the most wanton despotism, not to add the extreme of cruelty, the queen being now far advanced in her pregnancy by this her second husband. At the same time a proclamation was fulminated, declaring all those who continued to retain the castle of Stir∣ling against the regent and parliament, to be liable to the for∣feiture of life and possessions. All these preparations were worthy of laughter, when it is considered that they were le∣velled against a solitary fortress, unfurnished with ammunition and provisions; and against a defenceless woman, only armed with her spirit, and her tears: but they excited the malignity of the English faction, who pretended to gather uncommon consequences from these uncommon means. Dacre even ad∣vises the English council of state to interfere, for if James and his brother fell into Albany's hands they would certainly be murdered; and he remarks a dubiousness in the late comprehen∣sion
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>of peace, in which the Scotish king's name was omitted, so that, if Albany ascended the throne, it could not be violated by England without a war with France<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At length every preparation being made, the regent, attended by most of the Scotish peers, in order that they might warrant the measure by their presence, and leading not less than seven thousand men, marched to Stirling<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to the Council, 7 Aug. 1515, Cal. B. II, 369. O. "Wrongs done to the queen by Albany," March 1516, Cal. B. II, 173.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Aug.</NOTE> The proclamation had deterred and dispersed the queen's few defenders; and the castle, instead of the din of arms, presented silence and soli∣tude. Margaret smiled in disdain, when she beheld the army and artillery of Albany; and gave to her son, the king, the keys of the fortress, which the infant, at her nod, put into the hands of the regent. She then condescended to request Albany's favour to the king, and his brother, to herself, and to Angus; for herself and her sons the answer was beneficent; but the duke declared that, regarding Angus and his family as traitors, he could shew them no indulgence. The queen was then forced to return to the castle of Edinburgh, where she remained for a month, not without some appearance of captivity, being strictly watched by spies placed around her. The regent garrisoned the castle of Stirling with seven hundred men; and gave the king and his brother, with the fortress, in charge to the Earl Marshall, and the lords Fleming and Borth∣wick. About the same time Albany's servants pillaged Home's residence at Edinburgh; and the celebrated Patrick Panter the secretary was, on account of his attachment to that nobleman, arrested, and his goods despoiled; he was then committed pri∣soner to Inch Garvey, a small isle opposite to Queen's ferry, where he was confined in a tower built by James IV, towards
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>the end of his reign, in order to protect his navy, and annoy any enemy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Angus had retired into Tividale, to concert with Home what measures they should pursue. The regent resolved at once to terminate their schemes, and summoned a large array to meet him at Burrowmuir near Edinburgh before the end of August. Home, on his side, victualled Fastcastle; and Dacre availed himself of his neighbourhood, to instigate him more and more against Albany, but Angus he regarded as too young to be entrusted with a political conference<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Albany having returned to Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Aug.</NOTE> made an attempt to gain the queen and Angus, by offering them articles, importing that they should unite with his measures in the government, and desire no aid from other realms especially from England, with∣out the special leave of the regent, and the three estates; while he, on his side, engaged to help and defend them in all their just and equitable actions, causes, and quarrels, and par∣ticularly to put the queen in full possession of her enfeoffment, or jointure-lands, of which, in the disorders of the times, she had been in a great degree bereaved; a loss which reduced her to a poverty to be esteemed great, when her station, and former means, were considered. The queen rejected the articles; but sent them to Dacre to shew what she sacrificed<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C. proposed <HI>indenture,</HI> 14 Aug. 1515, Cal. B. VI, 83.</NOTE>.

Meanwhile the regent's army, to the amount of about forty thousand men, assembled at Burrowmuir; but to shew his pacific intentions towards England, he sent Sir William Scot, and Sir Robert Lawder, to meet Dacre and Dr. Magnus, a civilian of great talents, the English commissioners, in order to adjust any disputes on the marches.

<P>The queen, disgusted with her residence in the castle of Edinburgh, sent Robert Car with letters of credence to Dacre, in which she informs him that being constrained by Albany to write letters contrary to her sentiments, and being kept in a kind of captivity, while her friends were in prison and her re∣venues retained, so that she suffered extreme poverty, she was determined to escape from such persecution. That she wishes to flee to the castle of Blacater, which Dacre had recommended as the surest refuge, from its proximity to England, while at the same time she could not be said to have abdicated her rights by leaving Scotland: and that, to accomplish this flight without suspicion, or obstruction, she proposes to retire first to Linlithgow, a town included in her dower, whence, on the first or second night, she will depart with her husband, and four or five servants not in the secret. The chamberlain was to meet her within two or three miles of Linlithgow, with forty stout men, in order to convoy her to Blacater: if any obstacle occurred on her part, he was to burn some town of Albany's estates, and thus pretending an excursion, to depart till another night were appointed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>The neglect of the French monarchs, Louis XII and Francis I, who, in contradiction of the terms of the alliance with Scot∣land, had concluded their pacifications with Henry, without the previous consent of the Scotish government, had irritated the Scots; who accepted the comprehension in the treaties with such neglect, and in so equivocal a manner, that it re∣mained doubtful whether England and Scotland were in a state of peace or war. At the same time the recent alliance between France and Scotland being understood to expire upon the death of the contracting monarchs, if not ratified anew, Du Planis had arrived to accomplish this object, not without jealousy on the part of England, against which that alliance had been directed. It was therefore an eager wish of Henry that an embassy should be sent from Scotland, formally to conclude a peace, or at least a truce; and Albany, to prevent the obstruction of his designs, now amused Dacre with the hope of that embassy. But the English warden, knowing the regent's art, continued nevertheless to hold many conferences with Home, and to promise him Henry's effectual support<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Henry, 10 Sept. 1515, Cal. B. III, 20.</NOTE>: nor in vain, for, though the queen warmly expostulates against
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>her brother's delay, that he was sincere appears from the order or permission given to Sir Christopher Dacre, to assist Home by making a strong inroad into Scotland<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre and Magnus to Henry, 18 Oct. 1515, B. VI, 110.</NOTE>. Yet the distance of the English court, and its aversion to enter into declared war against Scotland, and thereby enforce its connexion with France, conspired with the great preparations and artifices of Albany, to leave the queen, Angus, and Home, open to every effort of his enmity.</P>
<P>The regent having collected a large host, accompanied with strong artillery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Sept.</NOTE> advanced towards the borders for the de∣struction of Home, and of the queen's friends<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dacre in a letter to Wolsey, 12 Sept. 1515, Cal.

Dacre esti∣mates the Scotish army at upwards of 80,000: a number hardly credible, were not Albany's caprice capable of any absurdity.</NOTE>. The firm resistance expected from the chamberlain evaporated before the numerous array of Albany; whose toils and obstacles consisted only in the difficulties and delays of marching through a wide territory.

<P>Home, in revenge, made many incursions into Scotland; and Albany, exasperated at this contempt of his authority and the ineffectual issue of his expedition, resolved to employ every art to get that nobleman into his power. For this purpose he employed De Planis, the French embassador, to write to Home, assuring him of an amnesty, provided he would cease to distress the country; and inclosing a pardon, formally signed by the regent, with some articles of importance, on which a confer∣ence was demanded. The chamberlain, unsuspicious of fraud, and having no reason to extol the support of England, con∣sented to meet Albany at Dunglass castle. On their arrival Home observed some suspicious appearances, and warned his followers who fled to his brother in the marches; while he was himself seized, in contempt of good faith, and thrown into a vault, the door of which was secured with a chain. Next morning he was brought before the regent, who required him to exile himself to France or Italy for three years: a forced consent was given: and the chamberlain, till his embarkation could be arranged, was conveyed to Edinburgh, and commit∣ted to the keeping of Arran, who had married his sister<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>A most unexpected scene now took place: Home not only contriving a speedy escape, but persuading his keeper to ac∣company him. By what arguments Arran was induced to this rash step is not to be discovered: perhaps he only wished to save his relation, and his own safety forbade him to remain behind: perhaps he hoped to acquire the regency by the assistance of England. Certain it is that Home, after giving notice to his two brothers, whom he had sent for as hostages, to flee to England, as he and Arran intended to escape from the castle of Edinburgh that night, effectuated his purpose with secrecy and security. The two peers, only attired
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>in their doublets, travelled fourteen miles on foot, before they could procure horses; and, on the next morning, arrived at the marches, and informed Dacre of the event. The day after Augus joined them at Wooler: and they all swore to maintain the queen's party. Home's brothers had also arrived; and Lennox, apparently somewhat persuaded by Arran, was ex∣pected: but his accession appears not. It was now resolved to use every endeavour to annoy Scotland, and disturb Albany's government; a measure hardly necessary as Dacre represents that country as a prey to constant robberies, fires, slaughters, so that the regent was already disgusted with his ineffectual power<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Dacre and Magnus to Henry, 18 Oct.

Yet candor will not listen to an enemy, on a charge of such atrocity; and will barely admit that the ab∣sence of a mother's care may have caused the infant to pine away, or occasioned a culpable neglect in the attendants.</P>
<P>This eventful year was concluded by a renovation of the alliance with France, on the same terms with that ratified by James IV<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This appears to have been the chief object of the embassy of De Planis.

The conquests of Francis I in Italy had also excited the jealousy of Henry: and the peace between England and France stood in a most uncertain predicament. The policy of Henry eagerly desired a lasting peace with Scotland, that he might not only be at liberty to direct his ambitious arms to the continent, but that he might at the same time have an
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>open field to secure the internal arrangement of Scotland, by intrigues, which war would only have obstructed: the French faction, on the contrary, desired short and ambiguous truces, that if Henry should declare against France the usual Scotish aid might be interposed.</P>

<P>Albany's inauspicious regency continued to surfer constant distraction.

The regent, in order to attach the nobles, the French

His necessity, or insatiate avarice and profuse dissipation, had not only seized the queen's jewels and jointure, but had despoiled the royal palaces, and sold offices of emolument and trust<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Memorial by Dunkeld, Jan. 1522. Cal. B.

His measures were completely foiled; and henceforward his struggle against Henry's influence was weak, fruitless, and ineffectual.</P>
<P>Angus and Home, finding themselves neglected by the Eng∣lish king, and deprived by the conclusion of a treaty of any open aid from England, resolved, without the queen's know∣ledge,
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>to accommodate their affairs with Albany; who now affected great lenity, and assented to admit them to their for∣mer honours and possessions. They accordingly returned to Scotland, and resided in a quiet manner on their estates<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Henry, 12 April 1516, B. III, 31.</NOTE>. The queen, now confined by a long illness at Morpeth, never pardoned, and never could pardon, this shocking and disgrace∣ful defection of her husband, the inhumanity of which was, if possible, increased by her situation on a bed of sickness at the time; and this was the real cause of that lasting enmity which our historians, ignorant of this circumstance, impute to an amour of Angus. Margaret's determination of proceed∣ing to her brother's court, instead of returning to Scotland, was a strong motive to this step; as Angus and Home regarded her resolution as a dereliction of any claim to the Scotish go∣vernment, and, in mere prudence, could not be much blamed for not sacrificing all their fortunes to a cause confessed to be desperate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">beg.

<PB N="157" REF="163"/>this purpose, and knowing that France would find sufficient exercise for her arms in Italy against the emperor Maximilian, determined with a high hand to eject Albany from his regency. Sounding the Scotish embassadors to this effect, who repre∣sented their want of power to negotiate on the subject, the im∣patient monarch, on the day on which the truce was signed, directed a letter, to be presented to the three estates of Scot∣land; insisting upon the dismission of Albany, who, from his propinquity of blood, and next claim to the crown, was the most suspicious guardian that could have been appointed to the infant James<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 550, from the answer of the Scotish parliament.</NOTE>.

Yet Albany, conscious of the insecure foundation on which his regency stood, now entered into a secret negotiation with Wolsey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 July</NOTE> and agreed that the infant king should be regarded as solely under the safeguard of the three estates, that he would consent to a perpetual peace, and would visit the English court himself, to confer with Henry<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ib. 574, where Henry's confirmation of the articles agreed on by Albany and Wolsey 24 July, is given, and dated 31 Dec. 1516.</NOTE>.

The first is from Buchanan, who, to confirm his fable, adds that Moray the natural son of James IV, appeared in evidence; but that peer was only aged twenty in 1519. O. Dacre to Wolsey, B. III, 16, and was apparently now on his travels, for after a long absence he returned to Scotland in 1519. ib. Perhaps James Hepburn, <HI>bishop of Moray,</HI> may be meant. The second charge is from Drummond, and is improbable in itself, as Albany lately arrived in Scotland, could only know what was known to others, and as regent could hardly be admitted as an accuser.</NOTE>; and, if he had not
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>been pardoned for former transgressions, he could not have sitten in the parliament of July<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">On the 9th June, 1516, Albany gave Dunglass castle to Home.

But as Dacre, by his own confession, was daily ravaging Scotland by hired bands, pro∣bably of Home's followers; and the chamberlain's connexion with Dacre was known; it was not unreasonable to impute those shocking disorders to Home's connivance, if not instiga∣tion: and the regent cannot be highly blamed for making this great example of a nobleman, who had thus abused his mercy, in order to deter others from a crime destructive of all govern∣ment and property. In consequence of their sentences, Home was beheaded on the eighth of October<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 383.

<P>At length Francis de Bordeaux arrived as embassador from France; and the parliament again met.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Nov.</NOTE> His instructions having previously been shewn to the regent and privy council, some articles were now extracted and laid before the three estates; who were surprized to find almost every demand, which they had desired their embassador the bishop of Ross to make, completely rejected. Francis I, their great and good ally, refused to yield the county of Xaintonge, which had been assigned by Charles VII to James I, in November 1428, as before mentioned, on pretext that it was an inalienable portion of the royal domain; he refused any aid to Scotland, and ad∣vised peace with England on any terms; he refused even to ratify the alliance between France and Scotland, renewed and sworn by De Planis, and the Scotish council of regency, within a year and a day after the death of James IV<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 243—248; and the answer of the Scotish parliament, ibid. 249—257.</NOTE>. At the same time it appears that La Fayette, the messenger of Albany, arrived with private advice to him to leave Scotland, as the present politics of France prevented his being supported in that country. The regent's affairs being now desperate, he resolved to avail himself of his present remnant of power, and prevailed on the parliament to set aside his elder brother Alex∣ander Stuart, and to declare himself the second person in the kingdom, and undoubted heir to the throne in case of the death of his nephew<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 383. From Scotstarvet's Calendars of Charters it appears that, on the 13th Nov. 1516, a ratification passed in parliament of a divorce pronounced by the Official of Lothian, between the deceased Alexander duke of Albany, and dame Catherine Sinclair daughter of the earl of <HI>Caithness,</HI> (the latter designation of her father, formerly Orkney,) because of consanguinity: and declaring the regent only lawful son of the late Albany by Agnes of Boulogne, in course second person in the kingdom, and capable of succeeding to the crown; from which claim Alexander commendator of Inchaffray the son of the former mar∣riage, is formally set aside.</NOTE>. Nor could his ambition probably have
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>ever aspired further; for, without the aid of France, he could not have ascended the Scotish throne; and the generous na∣ture of Francis I would have abhorred such an enterprize.</P>
<P>Some days having elapsed after this important object had been adjusted, the regent in a full parliament, at that time held in the tolbooth or guildhall of Edinburgh, arose, and, with a countenance betraying an agony of perplexity and confusion, requested the permission of the three estates to visit France; solely, as he pretended, with an intention to consult the French king, and to console his own wife now in a bad state of health<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">To acute observers the absence of Albany's wife might have always declared, that he did not intend a fixed residence in Scotland.</NOTE>. Great clamours followed this unexpected demand; and it was at first declared in their resentment that if he must sail to France, whatever might be the pretext, or real cause, he should never again be admitted into Scotland; and that if he went the estates would abandon the French alliance, from which only fatal or disgraceful consequences flowed, and would form a conjunction with England, which would not only de∣liver them from constant anxiety and apprehension, but would redound to the eternal profit of the realm: they concluded with requiring him to maintain his high station till the king should have attained the age of eighteen, agreeably to their determination of the preceding year. But Albany assuring them that England would yet further prolong the truce, if he were permitted to depart; and displaying a prodigality of pro∣mises; the states relented, and gave a reluctant permission<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">These particulars are derived from an important letter of Benolt, the Cla∣renceux, to Wolsey, dated, on his return, at Alnwick 30 Nov. 1516, Cal.

<P>The period assigned by Albany for his departure was proba∣bly the approaching spring, as navigation was then very un∣usual in winter. He accordingly remained in Scotland till June, in a tantalizing and unhappy situation. Though he had promised to Wolsey that he would pass by the English court, he now began to frame excuses, sensible that the step could procure him no advantage, but would excite the jealousy both of the Scots and French: he alledged that the estates would not consent, and insisted upon great hostages to be transmitted to France, and to Scotland<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>Clarenceux having returned with the proper ratifications,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1517 Jan.</NOTE> and with fresh instructions from Wolsey and Dacre, the par∣liament again met, and sanctioned the truce<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 581.</NOTE>, now extended to the thirtieth of November this year, in consequence of Albany's confirmation of his articles entered into with Wolsey in the preceding July, and of his projected departure in com∣pliance with the wishes of England. Yet it appears that the English herald still delayed to present the proper ratification of the truce, as being instructed to use every precatuion against the regent's art and duplicity. To strengthen his influence Albany now conferred the office of chamberlain, the second in the kingdom, upon lord Fleming<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 384. Crawf.

The regent dispatched De la Fay∣ette, his envoy, to the English court, with instructions to re∣quest of Wolsey that, in publishing the truce, no mention should be made of the secret article concerning his departure, but that he should be invited in gentle terms to visit England<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Credence from Albany to La Fayette, sent to Wolsey, B.

<PB N="165" REF="171"/>Clarenceux, who accompanied the envoy, was taught to believe that La Fayette was ordered to pass from England to France, whence he was to bring twelve gentlemen to ac∣company Albany with due splendor in his journey through England; an intention which he repeated with many oaths and imprecations<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Clarenceux to Dacre, B. VI, 184.</NOTE>. Yet about this time he sent a letter to the Danish king, accusing Henry of delay in the ratification, and requesting information if Denmark could assist Scotland, her ally, with some forces by the month of June<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 259.</NOTE>: this measure he seems to have adopted as the last resource to support his re∣gency, France having refused her concurrence. He at the same time wrote to Henry and Wolsey, requiring that the original deed of truce should be sent ratified, a cause, or a pretext, of further delay. As a mode perhaps of banishment, during transactions mortifying to the regent, if inspected by skilfull eyes, Gawin Douglas now acknowledged bishop of Dunkeld, and Patrick Panter secretary to the king, were sent on an embassy to France in order to assist the bishop of Ross, the former embassador there, in adjusting a lasting alliance<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 385, but he errs in mentioning Glencairn as one of the embassadors, that nobleman having been declared a rebel by Albany, Cal.

<P>During nearly four succeeding years the materials of history are scanty, and unimportant; and with the void in our annals the defect of the epistolary commerce of the actors concerned also corresponds. When great events are in agitation numerous resources must be employed, an eagerness of intelligence pre∣vails; and the letters being of real importance are the more likely to be preserved. England had likewise attained her chief object in effecting the absence of Albany, and was occupied with more important affairs on the continent, so that her intercourse with Scotland, (to which we are indebted for the most curious epistles, France being too distant, and the natives not corre∣sponding with each other on events generally known in their country,) became lax and unfrequent; and a similar sterility is found during the actual authority of James V, his attach∣ment to France rendering any correspondence with England, except by the means of embassadors, almost an act of treason.</P>
<P>In the former reign the repeated insurrections of Sweden against Denmark, the ally of Scotland, have been mentioned; and the aid promised or lent by James IV to John the Danish sovereign. Sweden continuing to shew as little attachment to Christiern II, the successor of his father John, and afterwards from his cruel measures in that kingdom to be surnamed the tyrant, he had in the preceding year applied to the Scotish regency, for the assistance of a thousand highlanders, to war in the mountainous heaths of the rebellious country<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>The discord between the factions of Angus and Arran con∣tinued to increase; but the former was somewhat weakened by the want of considence between the queen and her husband.

Such means were little adapted to the inborn freedom of the human mind, or to the softness of a sex, repugnant to steru∣ness, though easily won by gentleness; and Margaret was henceforth somewhat estranged from her brother, and even more negligent of her reputation, thus wantonly attacked by her friends, while her enemies were silent. She was however for a while intimidated, and confounded; and though the chancellor, Argyle, Arran, Lennox, with the lords Fleming, Sempil, and Maxwell, warmly opposed her reconciliation to Angus, she met him at Edinburgh, and it was effected for a season<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>We have seen Albany intercede with the council of regency, in support of the Danish king's request: and he continued, during his residence at Paris, to interfere in the foreign affairs of Scotland, in virtue of the commission given to him to transact them, though absent from his official station. Patrick Panter remained in France, as his secretary, where he died the fol∣lowing year; Albany having used his eloquent pen in promoting his influence. The citizens of Middleburg applied to the nominal regent, desiring to have their town constituted the Scotish mart in the Low Countries, instead of Campvere; but the latter by presents to Albany maintained its appointment<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 276, 284.</NOTE>. The disposal of benefices was however the most fertile field of peculation: and Albany, by frequent applications to the pope, exerted himself to render it productive<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 278, 282, 288, &amp;c. One letter successfully solicits the abbey of Scone for Alexander Stuart, the regent's elder brother.</NOTE>: but he has the merit of soliciting for natives, while the cardinals, and the Italian clergy, their dependents, were eagerly grasping at every vacant benefice in christendom; nor did their avarice spare situations of which they were as ignorant as of the antipodes; an abuse daily complained of, and among many others, to advance the reformation now commenced by Luther.</P>
<P>Not contented with a distant influence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1519 Jan.</NOTE> Albany had recourse to a mean artifice, in order to induce the French monarch to delegate him to his former station in Scotland; by command∣ing Panter to write a letter to Leo X, in the name of the three estates of Scotland, and dated at Edinburgh, intreating
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>the pontiff to intercede for them with Francis, that the regent might be permitted to return<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 294, and the note of the transcriber 296.</NOTE>: but this artifice was as inef∣fectual as it was presumptuous.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Danish king, finding his success against Steno Sture, the second Swedish administrator of that name, more and more doubtful<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Mallet Abr. de l'Hist. de Dannemarc, I, 188.</NOTE>, did not cease to instigate the remote aid of Scotland, by the means of his embassador Alexander King∣horn, a Scotish physician established in Denmark. The council of regency and the earl of Arran whose power as lieutenant general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> was now such as to be separately courted, answered that the incursions of the islanders prevented any great exer∣tion in support of their ally; but that any rebels, or persons guilty of treason against the state, should be arrested and sent<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 313, 315.</NOTE>. A fit assistance to the second Christiern, now revolving the sanguinary massacre of Stockholm, and opening by the axe of despotism the path to Swedish independance, and to the glo∣rious revolution to be effected by Gustaf Wase! Yet soon after a small supply of soldiers and ammunition was sent to Copen∣hagen, under the command of James Stuart of Ardgowan<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 317, 318.</NOTE>; but some merchants of Leith giving in, almost at the same time, a remonstrance against the Danes, who had seized their ship after it had been rifled by Swedish pirates; the council sent a warm memorial to Christiern<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ib. 320.</NOTE>; and appear to have abandoned any further effort to serve him in his ungenerous enterprizes.</P>
<P>The French king having renewed the peace with England in the preceding year, and Scotland being included among other allies, if she accepted the terms<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil des Traictez, sub anno.</NOTE>, an embassador came

At the same time Francis had written to the council of regency, desiring this extension of the truce; but the chancellor informed Dacre that the powers of the council were not sufficient for this purpose, and that the con∣sent of a parliament was necessary<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">C. Archbishop of Glasgow, chancellor, to Dacre, 29 Oct. B.

This assembly was apparently soon con∣vened; for the French embassador, attended by Benolt the Clarenceux herald, proceeded towards Scotland; and was met at Morpeth by Dacre, pursuant to Wolsey's desire<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C.

She adds that as Henry had sent her a dia∣mond, she returns a token to him, being a ring which he had formerly sent to her; and apologizes for not writing with her own hand, as she is sick with the small pox.
<P>Though Rymer, as just mentioned, has no instrument of this truce, Lesley, who has used far superior materials to those of Buchanan, presents some curious details concerning it, p. 393, from which it appears that Angus endeavoured to induce the embassadors to regard him, and his party, as the rulers; and upon their persisting in requiring the consent of Arran, and the council, and con∣cluding the truce at Stirling with them, Angus beset the envoys on their return by Carlaveroc, and not only sternly reproached them, but put them in the utmost fear of their lives.</P></NOTE>; but not

<P>Meanwhile suspicions of a pestilence having arisen at Edin∣burgh, the king was removed from the castle to Dalkeith, a pleasant village in its vicinity, where the court was increased and adorned by the arrival of the earl of Murray from France<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">O.

The public commotions were far from being appeased even by the dismal apprehensions of a pestilence, and the factions of Angus and Arran raged with increasing fury. David Home of Wedder∣burn, who had married the sister of Angus, revived his cha∣racter of an assassin, by the murder of Blacader, prior of Coldingham, and six men of his family: and William Douglas

<P>The king was speedily brought back to the castle of Edin∣burgh, and was attended by Angus, Errol, Crawford, Glamis,
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>Forman archbishop of St. Andrew's, the bishops of Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Orkney, Dumblane, and many abbots and ecclesi∣astics of rank, who withdrew to the capital as a place of safety. But the gates of the castle were shut by the lords to whose care the king was committed; and the party of Angus did not presume to violate the decree of the national council. Arran for a while withdrew to Glasgow; whither he was followed by the chancellor, Lennox, Eglinton, Cassils, Sempil, Ross, the bishop of Galloway, the abbot of Paisley, and many other ecclesiastic, and temporal, chiefs of the western regions<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 392.</NOTE>; so that the dispute seemed to divide Scotland into the eastern and western factions, the former maintaining the English, the latter the French, interest.</P>
<P>Among the enemies of Angus was Ker of Ferniherst,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1520 Jan.</NOTE> irri∣tated by some dispute concerning a court to be held in Jedburgh∣forest. Sir James Hamilton, the bastard of Arran, assembled four hundred men to support the claim of Ferniherst; but John lord Somerville, and Ker of Cessford, suddenly attacking Hamilton's party, they fled, leaving four on the field, and their leader with difficulty escaped to Home castle<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 394.

Unhappily no original letter on the subject remains.</NOTE>, probably with a view to mitigate the contending factions, and allay the national dis∣orders, very different effects ensued. For the party of Angus
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>having in a great measure evacuated the capital, that the as∣sembly might be from, that of Arran arrived in such numbers that apprehensions were entertained, or pretended, for the safety of Angus, who had retained only about four hundred followers armed with spears. From Buchanan's account it indeed appears that to sooth the Hamiltons, Archibald Douglas had resigned his magistracy, which was conferred on Robert Logan<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Arnot, Hist. Edin. quotes the council register, Vol. I, p. 12, for an order in Albany's name, prohibiting the election of a Hamilton or a Douglas into the office of provost. It is dated 20 Feb. 1519-20.</NOTE>; and that the fears for Angus were well grounded, as the western peers had met in the chancellor's house, and con∣sulted on the means of apprehending that earl. Angus, in∣formed of their meeting and intentions, sent his uncle Gawin Douglas bishop of Dunkeld to caution them against any vio∣lence; and offered, if they had any offence to alledge, that he would be judged by the laws of the country. But the bishop found them already armed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 Apr.</NOTE> and determined on the most des∣perate measures. He reproached the chancellor, James Beton archbishop of Glasgow, for procedures so unworthy of a churchman, who imputed the whole to Arran, enraged at the many insults he had suffered from Angus. The archbishop, prepared for a rencounter, had clothed himself with mail con∣cealed under his cassock, and concluded a vehement speech to Gawin Douglas by striking his breast, and exclaiming, "There is no remedy. Upon my conscience, I cannot help it." His armour rang under his hand; and Dunkeld said, with a sneer, "I perceive, my lord, that your conscience is not sound, as appears from its rattling." He then applied to Sir Patrick Hamilton, the brother of Arran, to mediate concord; but Sir James Hamilton, Arran's natural son, reproaching Sir Patrick as averse to sight, the latter was stung with the sarcasm, and
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>they all rushed into the streets, attended by a formidable band of followers.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Angus had arranged his adherents in the high street, and apparently in the upper part of it extending from the castle to St. Giles's church; and he was now, or in the midst of the conflict, joined by David Home of Wedderburn, and William Douglas prior of Coldingham, with their feroci∣ous followers from the marches, summoned before to his assist∣ance by the zeal of his friends. The contest was fierce; and about seventy were slain, among whom was Sir Patrick Hamil∣ton, who fell by the hand of Angus himself<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">This circumstance is evidenced by a latter from Wolsey to Norfolk, 1524, Cal. B. I, 325, mentioning the causes of the enmity between Angus and Arran: the cardinal adds that the former attempted to kill the latter himself.</NOTE>, and lord Mont∣gomery the son of Eglinton. Arran, (whose followers could hardly form any batallion, being slain or routed as they issued from the narrow passages on the south into the street), was forced to flee with his bastard son through a ford in the northern lake; while the chancellor, and many others, regained the Dominican church, on the opposite side of the city<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Blackfriars, or Dominican, convent and church occupied the site of the present Infirmary, a happy exchange of superstition for beneficience.</NOTE>. Beton was seized behind the high altar, and in danger of his life, when Gawin Douglas who had, with the decency of his order, retired to his lodging during the conflict, learning the perilous situation of the archbishop, flew to his rescue; and requesting his assailers not to contaminate their cause by the blood of a consecrated prelate, he succeeded in the pious attempt.</P>
<P>The party of Angus remained masters of the city, and did not use their victory with much moderation. The earl visited the queen his wife, who had taken refuge in the castle, and whose affections were completely estranged from him. George
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>Home the brother of the late earl, and many other chiefs, with their followers, some months after, joined Angus at Edin∣burgh. In contempt of Albany's authority, the heads of the executed earl of Home, and his brother William, were taken down from the tolbooth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 July</NOTE> and solemnly buried in the Dominican church yard<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 395, ever superior in accuracy to Buchanan, who, XIV, 12, dates this incident in the ensuing year.

Their instructions were to this pur∣port, that peace should be preserved as much as possible during the king's minority, and that the truce with England should be prolonged; that Albany's return ought not to be desired, being warmly opposed by Henry, who had averred, that, on that event, he would declare war at the expiration of the truce, and the English party at the same time opposing Albany,
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>an external war would be joined with intestine commotions; that Francis earnestly attached to the welfare of Scotland, de∣sired his embassadors to use every endeavour to allay the do∣mestic ferments, and restore public order; and lastly that as Louisa, the mother of the French king, and ever regent in his absence, was to send an embassy to England, before St. An∣drew's day, so the Scots should be desired to follow the same course<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Instructions, ibid.</NOTE> A letter was also brought, directed to the parliament of Scotland, importing that Francis now fulfilled his promise by Flamigny, that an honourable embassy should be sent, to appease discords, in committing this trust to Aubigny the cap∣tain of his guards, and De Planis a doctor of laws, both of them counsellors of state; and that it was advantageous for the internal and external tranquillity of Scotland that Albany should remain in France<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Epist. supra cit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the political sky now began to be darkened with clouds, which were soon to produce a tempest. In the preceding year Charles king of Spain had been elected emperor, in opposition to Francis I, whose resentment indicated those approaching wars, which were for a long time to agitate Europe. The English monarch held his famous conference with Francis in June this year: but the ambition of Wolsey, who hoped to at∣tain the papacy by supporting Charles V, was soon to direct the councils of Henry against France. The French embassa∣dors had been dispatched at a time when it was the interest of both Henry and Francis that peace between England and Scotland should be preserved; but the fluctuation of Henry's disposition now rendered it necessary that Scotland should be free from that connection, that she might assist France if at∣tacked by the English arms. Amid these doubts and variations
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>it is no wonder that only short and reluctant truces were formed<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See Rymer, 730—733, concerning Aubigny and De Planis. Some cor∣respondence on the subject, between the archbishop of Glasgow chancellor and Dacre, Feb. and March 1521, is extant, Cal. B. VI, 227, 229.

The name was perhaps Maurice de Gouzolles. In Lindsay's history, p. 204, <HI>Lusence</HI> is a mere corruption of Gouzolles. See the notes at 1524.</NOTE>. The queen, not chusing punctually to follow the dictates of Henry, was treated by him, and by Wolsey and Dacre, with neglect: and in revenge, and in expectation of more attention, and more considerable pecuniary supplies, she turned her eyes to∣wards France. A conjunction of her interests with those of Albany promised to both the complete command of Scotland; and she knew the French court was prodigal of money in sup∣port of any scheme, while the avaricious Wolsey too intent on
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>amassing treasures to purchase the papal throne, would not supply her finances, rendered dubious and scanty by the dis∣turbed state of property, amid the intestine conflagrations. At any rate she would evince her weight to Henry, and render him willing to secure her return to his interests by a conduct more fraternal, and rewards more opulent. Such, if we may judge from her own letters, were the motives of Margaret. On the other hand Albany had found from experience how ineffectual his own power had proved; and as he had, after a rash recourse to violent measures against her, in vain attempted a reconciliation, when the offences were too keen and recent, it is not surprizing that he eagerly acceded to this plan, first suggested as appears, by a letter from the queen, inviting his return<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Margaret, 10 July, Cal. B. II, 158.</NOTE>. The terms were accordingly, unknown to England, concluded to the satisfaction of both; but they were condi∣tional as the consent of Francis to Albany's presence in Scot∣land could not be effected at the expence of his amity with Henry; an obstacle which the inimical conduct of the English court towards France was soon to remove.</P>
<P>This plot was however disclosed by spies to the acute Dacre, who in a letter reproached the queen for writing to Francis and soliciting Albany's return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 July</NOTE> while she knew that his father had termed James III a bastard, and had aspired to the king∣dom<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; a conduct which the regent's ambition would prompt him to imitate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 July</NOTE> Margaret, in her answer, confesses that she wrote the letter, at the request, as she alledges, of the peers; but accuses Henry and Wolsey, as the authors of her necessity to adopt this plan, as her revenues since her return had been dilapidated, and she had in vain applied to her brother for
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>remedy<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Margaret to Dacre, Cal. B. II, 159. It was probably about this time that the queen sent an envoy to England, with the instructions, B.

The party of Angus might thus attempt to agitate the public mind.</NOTE>. Wolsey also informed Dacre that he had some in∣telligence of this design, the French king having imparted to the English embassador at Paris that Albany intended to revisit Scotland, and was soliciting the queen's divorce from Angus, apparently with an intention to marry her; and that Francis had added his apprehensions concerning the fate of the infant king<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">C.

<P>During these transactions the powers of the regency were insensibly diminished: Angus, one of the members, maintain∣ing an uncontrouled sway. He was ever firmly attached to the English interest, but his youth and inexperience rendered his attachment of little value, and the disorders of his follow∣ers disgusted all ranks; while Arran, himself a model of do∣mestic oeconomy and prudence, recommended his party by their general respect to law and property<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Henry being now about to conclude a treaty with the em∣peror Charles V against France, the interests of the latter country no longer prohibited the return of Albany to Scotland, but on the contrary demanded the presence of this delegate of Francis in this country.

Margaret, who at the time of Albany's former regency, had been just wedded to a young and attentive husband, and had regarded the duke as both a political and personal enemy, was now changed with the times; and such imprudent marks of affection appeared, between her and the regent, that there was ample room for scandal to accuse them both of adultery<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The original letters, alluding to this, are numerous; and some will be re∣serred to in the subsequent narrative.

<PB N="189" REF="195"/>ordered a parliament to be proclaimed, to be held at Edinburgh on the twenty sixth of that month of December: and the Douglases and their adherents, particularly Somerville, Home of Wedderburn, Cambusnethan, Cockburn of Langton, were soon after formally summoned to answer the high charges to be adduced against them<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. ib.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Albany and the queen had entered into a cor∣respondence with Dacre<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">To be sound in Caligula, B. VI, 198—203.

Albany sent Gaul∣tier Malignes, his secretary, to Dacre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Dec.</NOTE> remonstrating that though Henry was bound by the truce not to receive Scotish rebels, yet the bishop of Dunkeld, summoned to Rome by the regent's desire, and other rebels, were permitted to pass into England; and he desires they may be restored, to answer for their misdeeds at the approaching parliament. Dacre replied that the chief infringement of the truce was by the Scots them∣selves, who, because a petty English incursion had been un∣redressed, had recently entered England to the amount of four
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>hundred men, had burnt Learmouth near Wark, and therein a helpless female; had carried off four hundred kine, two thousand sheep, four hundred goats, and thirty geldings, with twenty captives. He at the same time retorted that lord Maxwell, the warden of the western marches, would not proclaim the peace; while the Homes, termed by Albany re∣bels, were the sole guardians of the eastern borders: and that if redress were not assigned the truce was to be regarded as annulled: nor does he address Albany as regent, but as one of the council. This spirited letter procured from the regent an immediate promise of redress: and the truce maintained its dubious faith till its expiration at candlemas next year. Dacre communicated these affairs to Wolsey<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Wolsey, 19 Dec. 1521, Cal. B. II, 274.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Dec.</NOTE> at the same time in∣forming him that Albany already used the style of majesty, saying "our wardens," and "our parliament;" and that, as he had spoken thus, "who is this Dacre? Is there none of you borderers who can fall into an altercation with him, and do me a pleasure?" he requested the cardinal to issue a joint com∣mission of wardency to himself and his brothers; that if danger arose he might send one of them to transact the business of the borders. He also adds that, since the arrival of Albany, three ships had reached Scotland from France laden with artillery, cartwheels, mattocks, and spades, accompanied by not one gentleman, but by one hundred and sixty craftsmen and artifi∣cers, chiefly as would appear in the military line; and that they had brought into port a Flemish ship of war, taken on their voyage<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

<P>Angus, George Home, called lord Home by the English party, and Somerville, having taken refuge at the Kirk of Steyle, empowered the bishop of Dunkeld, now passing into England, to transact their cause with Henry. Their instruc∣tions to him are signed on the fourteenth of December<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VI, 204. There is every reason to conclude that these instructions were drawn up by the bishop of Dunkeld. The obscure kirk of Steyle, whence they are dated, seems unknown to modern maps.</NOTE>; and after accusing the queen of maintaining a correspondence with Albany for a year past by means of his envoy, and referring to Dunkeld for other yet more criminal charges against her, they proceed to shew the danger in which their king is left; and to point out the remedies to be insisted on by Henry, such as, that the regent have no appointment of officers about the per∣son of James, nor approach within thirty miles of his resi∣dence; they conclude by requesting Henry, as they had sworn not to treat with Albany but with his leave, not to negotiate on his part without attention to their interest; and they desire to know what support they may expect if Albany ascend the throne. Dunkeld was desired to visit Dacre on his journey; to whom having shewn his instructions, that skillful peer en∣trusted him with his opinion upon them in writing, with much additional information addressed to the English monarch, which not being destitute of curiosity and importance shall here be abstracted<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VI, 205.</NOTE>. Dacre remarks that there was a rumour in Scotland of Albany's ascending the throne by the death of James; that the queen had attempted to induce Angus to a divorce, by offering him Ettrick forest, a part of her endowed lands, worth twelve hundred Scotish marks yearly; that the intelligence between her and the duke was scandalous, and in his opinion adulterous, if he may venture to insinuate so deli∣cate
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>a matter to his sovereign, but for this he refers to Dun∣keld; that the Scotish peers were more disposed to their own interest than to that of James; and Albany's influence with his relation the pope was such that all the abbeys were in his gift, and all the benefices falling in the papal month, which is every third month, and he gave them to sons of peers, and other men of rank not in orders; lord Fleming's son having the abbey of Holyroodhouse, worth yearly fourteen hundred pounds sterling; that the regent sold benefices as merchandize, and had received in money or security for them forty thousand marks Scotish, equivalent to ten thousand marks sterling: that he offered peace to the Douglas party upon these terms, An∣gus to consent to a divorce; and lord Home to resign such of his own or his wife's lands as were given away. The English warden proceeds to point out to his sovereign the danger of Albany's seizing the crown, and Scotland's being thus subject to a Frenchman; but that it would be preferable to continue an appearance of truce, as the Scots were "of that poverty and wretchedness, that they cannot make restitution upon a peace, as is the practice of other realms:" he adds that sums may be assigned to the northern lords of England, who shall make great inroads, and thus prevent the Scotish incursions by occupying their borderers in defence; and that if Henry gar∣rison the frontiers, and a report of instant war be covertly spread, he may distress as much as by open enmity, except he prefer to send large armies. But this crafty advice was little adapted to Henry's impetuosity.</P>
<P>The bishop of Dunkeld proceeded to London:<NOTE PLACE="marg">end Dec.</NOTE> and Angus and his followers were soon forced to retire into the English frontiers. Albany governed Scotland with absolute sway; and that ill-fated country seemed to have become a province of France.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE six succeeding years of the minority of James V are variegated with numerous events, and with singular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1522</NOTE> and unexpected, changes in the government. A war of three years
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>with England is to produce no great nor decisive incident; but is to add to the calamities which Scotland experienced under the inglorious regency of John duke of Albany.</P>
<P>The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan.</NOTE> which the regent had summoned to Edin∣burgh,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In this parliament, on the 28th Dec. 1521, the treaty of Rouen, Aug. 1517, was solemnly confirmed. MS. Leagues France and Scotland, Harl. 1244, sub anno.</NOTE>, appears not to have proceeded against Angus, and his adherents. Albany had discovered from experience that violence is but a resource of weakness, while a firm government is only to be founded on conciliation, and views of general interest. The bishop of Dunkeld, now in London, where he was to die of the pestilence in the ensuing month of March, managed with his usual ability the cause of his party at the English court. He represented to Wolsey that Gaultier Malignes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Jan.</NOTE> the secretary of Albany, ought not to be listened to in his claim concerning Dunkeld's being remitted to Scotland, as he intended only to pass to Rome whither he had been summoned<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Dunkeld to Wolsey, 1 Jan. 1522. Cal. B.

B. VI, 424.</NOTE>: but Beton's ambition was nevertheless successful.</P>
<P>A memorial, presented by the bishop of Dunkeld to the English court, deserves especial attention and shall here be abstracted, as it throws new and strong light on many features of Albany's regency, and on the state of Scotland at this time: but it must not be forgotten that it is the work of an enemy<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. III, 309. Besides intrinsic evidence that this important paper was composed by Dunkeld, on comparing it with such of his letters as are not holo∣graphic, it will be found to be in the handwriting of his secretary.</NOTE>. Dunkeld states that Albany has no estate in Scotland, sufficient
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>to answer for his intromissions with the public money, but is a servant of France, an officer of her armies, a knight of her orders, a vassal for his wife's vast estates: that the king's for∣tresses of Dunbar, Dunbarton, and Inchgarvey, are garrisoned with Frenchmen, and the expences quadrupled, Albany being prodigal of the royal treasures; each soldier was allowed four pounds Scotish money of monthly pay; to De la Bastie, whom he had left as his deputy, a salary was assigned of five Scotish pounds daily, which, since his death, had been allotted to Arran: that the regent had not only wasted fifty thousand franks, sent by the French king to James in recompence of the damage sustained by Scotland in assisting France, and an additional sum of twenty thousand crowns recently received by himself during his residence in Paris, but had converted the royal robes, of cloth of gold and sables, and the tapestries of purple and crimson velvet<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">"Palit of purpur and velvet cramesyn," is the poetical expression of the translator of Virgil.</NOTE> into dresses for his own pages, and servants, and coined the large silver vases<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">And coined in <HI>plaks</HI> (groats) the king's great silver <HI>stoppis</HI> double gilt.</NOTE>: that he had sold the three famous ships, the pride of the Scotish navy, worth at least three hundred thousand franks, besides some smaller vessels, and had used the money as his own<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The famous Michael was sold to Francis I, for 40,000 franks, (about as many pounds modern money,) in 1515 by albany, with the solemn permission of the Scotish council in the name of James, which see Epist. R. S. I, 214. Dunkeld says that the three ships, with artillery, &amp;c. had cost twice the sum for which they were sold.</NOTE>: that he gave or sold the lands and heritages falling to the crown, which, by the express law of Scotland, the king himself could not do till he were of the age of twenty five years complete<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">It was probably about this time that a paper was written, Cal. B. VI, 405, from which it appears that the chancellor possessed the earldom of Fife—Huntley the lordships of Prechin and Stradyc—Murray the duchy of Ross and Ardma∣nach—Argyle the lordship of the Isles, Kintyre, Knapdale and Cowal—Lennox the lordship of Bute—Cassils the lordship of Galloway, and earldom of <HI>Wynch∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me;</HI> and he was to answer to the <HI>Harbarties</HI> for these <HI>farms, at the duke's commandement.</HI></NOTE>;
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>and he had, within two years, sold the wards both of lands and marriage of Drummond, Sanquhar, and Barnbougle, worth forty thousand pounds Scotish currency, and the mar∣riages of the heiresses of Inverugy, worth more than ten thousand pounds like money: that there was no administration of justice: that Albany sold the ecclesiastic benefices: that, during the two first years of his regency, not less than three or four taxes, or contributions, had been levied on the people: that he had now imposed another tax, to the amount of twenty five thousand Scotish pounds: that he had appointed Robert Barton, a pirate, comptroller, and John Campbell, a bastard, without property, treasurer, who now jointly asserted that the king was indebted to each of them in a sum of ten thousand pounds, while they kept the royal child in such poverty, that he had hardly new doublets and hose, till his natural sister, the countess of Morton, provided them; and when the queen or Albany sent cloth of gold for the purpose, those covetous officers would not pay the taylor. The bishop, as is before mentioned, next brings against Albany the heinous charge of the death of the duke of Ross; and commemorates the similar crimes of Richard III: at the same time mentioning that Albany has an elder brother, Alexander Stuart commendator of Scone and Inchaffray, not in holy orders, but legally capable of marriage<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">His mother he calls a daughter of <HI>Orkney.</HI></NOTE>. He then states that the parliament had, on the twenty first of January one thousand five hundred and twenty one<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the original 1520: the modern computation always followed.</NOTE>, declared
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>that Albany's regency was to terminate, if he did not return before the first of August then next, now last<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">"Lammas day last bypast."</NOTE>, whereas he had not returned till towards the end of November, and had not been rechosen, but had usurped the authority: that the chancellor used his influence in procuring the succession to the throne to be declared in favour of Arran's sons, the children of his niece, and had said, on baptizing the first, "Who knows but I may live to place the crown on this head?" This long and interesting memorial is closed with a request, that Henry will imitate the example of his ancestor Henry III, who by arms removed the bad counsellors of the infant Alexander III<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For this Dunkeld refers to "the Scottis Cornikle."</NOTE>; and with a solemn asseveration of the veracity of its state∣ments.</P>
<P>On the other hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Jan.</NOTE> the queen sent an envoy to Henry her brother, with copious instructions wholly written by herself<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VI, 208.</NOTE>. She represents that Albany had given to her the bishopric of Dunkeld, among other benefices, and desires that Henry will not support the bishop, considering the evils which his counsels have produced in Scotland, and the scandalous reports which he propagates against her; but as she had given to him the bishopric, so she shall show that she can resume it. Margaret promises that an honourable embassy shall be sent, if Henry will agree to prolong the truce to midsummer; and asserts that Albany had only returned to Scotland in consequence of his engagements, and that if he had not come she must have left the kingdom; that he interfered not with the king, but the lords had permitted her to remain with her son in Edinburgh castle; that the regent's conduct to her was most respectful<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">"Sober and humbler nor ony other in Scotland."</NOTE>,
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>and that he allowed her money from his own coffers. She request, that Clarenceux may be sent, as being well acquainted with Scotland, and known to her and Albany, who will de∣clare to him his real intentions: if Henry refuse audience to her messenger, she desires him to give in his instructions; if all access be denied, to address Wolsey; but she hopes the king will lend a more favourable audience than his last, which was very stern: the cardinal, she adds, may correspond with Albany, yet she expects to be consulted; and as her industry has penned so long a paper, she prays her labour be not vain.</P>
<P>But it was completely vain, and Henry continued to favour Dunkeld and his party, though Albany and the chancellor exerted every art against him; the malice of the latter being further inflamed by a report that the bishop aspired to the see of St. andrew's, which he hoped to attain by the English in∣terest at Rome<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">In the Epist. R. S. I, 328, are letters under the great seal, confirming a decree against Dunkeld's claim of St. Andrew's, dated 21 Feb. 1522. At p. 333 occurs a letter from the chancellor to Christiern of Denmark, requesting him to support the authority of James at Rome, against the pretensions of Dunkeld to the primacy. It is dated 8th April; but the dates are sometimes erroneous; and it is possible that even then the death of Dunkeld, amind the extensive satality of a pestilence, might not be known in Scotland: for from the cessation of his letters after January, there is additional reason to believe that his life extended not beyond Feb. or March, though the last editor of his Virgil, proleg. p. 13, incline to fix his death to April.

<PB N="199" REF="205"/>but he bore letters of anger, and not of conciliation. Henry wrote to the queen, in the most severe terms of re∣proach for her imprudent conduct, political and personal : to Albany he averred his intentions of driving him from Scotland, and refused to make any further truce while he remained there; at the same time accusing him for his arrival, in contradiction to the oath of the French king, who still declared that Albany had sailed without his knowledge; and for the detestable ad∣vising of his sister to a divorce for some iniquitous purpose<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. Henry to Albany, B. VI, 220.</NOTE>. The English monarch also addressed the parliament of Scot∣land, remonstrating against the regent, and declaring war if he were not stripped of his power:<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Feb.</NOTE>: but the three estates in their answer repell the charges with spirit, assuring Henry that Albany being already married to a lady of large domains, he could have no personal view in favouring the queen's desire of a divorce from Angus; and they conclude with preferring war to a peace purchased with ignominy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 761.</NOTE> The regent, according to Lesley, answered the herald's demand with much force in open parliament<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 398. Albany might be magnanimous in oratory.</NOTE> : but, as he spoke no language but the French, an interpreter must have mediated in the explanation of his intentions to the audience. He informed Clarenceux, in pri∣vate, that he preferred his French possessions to the crown of Scotland; that he was surprized that Wolsey should accuse him of such intercourse with the queen as only occurs with a wife or a concubine; and that he had no intention of marry∣ing her, as his present wife was more than sufficient<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">O.

Mar∣garet, in a letter to her brother, reproves the harshness of his correspondence, in which he accused her of profligate love for Albany, and of a design to wed him; she blames Wolsey for

VI, 230.</NOTE>. She wrote an answer in six large pages, with her own hand, defending herself against every charge<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. B. VI, 232.</NOTE>. Her chief replies are, that at the last truce no mention was made of her interests; that she was neglected by Henry and by Dacre, while Angus usurped her houses and revenue, and she only received from England splendid professions: that, had not Albany assisted her, she must have sold her jewels and plate; and says the queen, "I must bear good mind, where I find good deed ... I must please this realm, since I have my living here; and have few friends, except my own good behaviour." She denies that she went to Linlithgow privately, as the peers knew her de∣parture, and sir James Hamilton was but one of many in her train: to the charge of her amorous intercourse with Albany she modestly answers, and imputes the scandal to Dunkeld: the proposal of her resuming Angus, her husband, she firmly rejects, observing that she had married him in opposition to the national will, and had thereby lost the tutorage of her son, the castle of Stirling, and the regency, while the return she met was extreme unkindness; he usurped her revenues; and she adds, "above all things, he spoke openly dishonour of me<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">"And, abof all thyng, he spake opynly dyshonor of me."</NOTE>:" since therefore she wedded him solely by her own will, no menaces shall induce her to reconciliation.</P>
<P>The truce had expired on the second day of February; and both countries prepared for war, to be commenced when the

From an original letter, Dacre to Wolsey, 18 Feb. 1522, Cal. B. II, 280, it appears that Angus clandestinely passed from the English bor∣ders to Scotland on the 12th Feb. and that it was said he was to be sent to France. Though Lesley says Sir George Douglas was exiled with his brother, there is reason to infer the contrary, for he was in Scotland in Sept. 1523, O. Surrey to Wolsey, B. VI, 317: and that historian also errs in supposing that Angus remained only one year in France, whereas he did not return till July 1524, as is evident from many original letters to be quoted at that epoch.</NOTE>. He accordingly returned to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Feb.</NOTE> whence he passed to France for two years; and returned so much im∣proved in general instruction, and political skill, that he was enabled to seize the reins of government, and long retain them, against all the arts and efforts of the queen, the fallen regent, and strong factions.</P>
<P>Some reluctance to proceed to hostilities still prevailed in both countries, and fluctuating negotiations were carried on for a prolongation of the truce. Henry was not enabled by his finances to muster an army against Scotland; but to evince his enmity to Albany he sent a squadron of seven ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 April</NOTE> which seized several Scotish vessels near Inchkeith, and ravaged the maritime towns and villages. The English however soon en∣countered

<P>The emperor Charles V having visited Henry VIII in Eng∣land, and alliance was concluded between them against France:<NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> and the English monarch sent a herald to defy Francis; and soon after took an active share in the war, though his profusion had so much diminished his funds, that he was hardly able to support an army. Margaret, who was as inconstant in her affections as her brother Henry, now began to waver in her attachment towards Albany<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Wolsey, 15 June, B. I, 19: but Dacre cannot as yet refrain from mentioning "her lewd demeanour."</NOTE>, whose French supplies were considerably drained; and her natural love of her country induced her to maintain a regular correspondence with Dacre, who by every art and pro∣mise persuaded her to prefer the English cause. By spies, and secret messengers, she informed the English warden of every important step taken by the regent; who it must be confessed, at the same time, acted with remarkable deficiency of skill or precaution. Albany, who received all his chief instructions, particularly those of war or peace with England, from the French cabinet, as appears from many papers yet extant, seems at length to have been instigated to invade England, in order if possible to prevent Henry from sending an army to the con∣tinent. The English monarch, informed of this intention, issued a commission of lieutenant general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 July</NOTE> and admiral, against the Scots to the earl of Shrewsbury<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 772.</NOTE>: and soon after an order was given for proclamations of array,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Aug.</NOTE> through the northern counties, as intelligence had been received that the Scots in∣tended to invade England in the beginning of September<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 773.</NOTE>.</P>

Hay desires that the English inroads may be forborne till the return of David Beton, the envoy sent from Scotland to London. Dacre answers that there can be no truce while Albany remains in Scotland. An original letter from Sir Philip Dacre to lord Dacre, 23 July [1522], Cal. B. VI, 421, mentions that an inroad had been made into Scotland—that the Scotish parliament met last friday, and that Albany was de∣termined to leave the country, if the states did not support his measures—that by Albany's command Arran had taken Somerville's house, (who was a partisan of Angus and Home), and turned his wife out of doors, though she was delivered but the day before—and it mentions the burning of Kelfo, where lord Dacre, as was rumoured, had betrayed Percy and Ogle. Albany, in his memorial of January 1523, (see that date,) specially mentions a cruel inroad of the English, as having preceded his invasion.

Wolsey was enraged at this intended interruption of a Scotish invasion, given to his favourite war of private pique against Francis; and while he affected to despise Albany's presumption, in thus mediating between England and France, his spleen could not avoid branding his measures, and those of the queen, as full of "pride and presumption, mixed with craft and double deal∣ing, after the Scotish manner<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. Wolsey to Dacre, no date, B. VI, 128.</NOTE>;" a reflection truly ludicrous, when it is considered that neither was a native of Scotland. In his answer to Margaret<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">C. B. VII, 145.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 Aug.</NOTE> Dacre says he has no power to conclude peace; but, knowing that Henry's inclinations were to avoid war if possible, he engages, if the queen to her lasting honour would mediate, to stop the English army: at the same time he replied to her credence by a secret letter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">C. ibid.</NOTE>, (which he
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>requests may be instantly burnt, as if shewn his ruin would follow,) that, if James be lodged in secure hands, Henry would not insist on Albany's leaving Scotland, but would regard his presence no more than that of any other subject prince. Dacre likewise sent articles of pacification, to shew to Albany;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Sept.</NOTE> who answered<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C. B. VII, 152.</NOTE> that nothing but a truce could now be undertaken, the army being assembled; but that a more lasting treaty might be deliberated, by embassadors to be sent to England, in virtue of a safe conduct now at Berwick for that purpose: that he desired peace, and would continue in that disposition, even though the succours which he expected from France should arrive, but that the allies must in all events be comprehended. The queen, on the same day, wrote to Dacre<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. ibid. 146.</NOTE>, shewing some distrust of his sincerity, as he denied his express power to treat, while Sir Antony Ughtred captain of Berwick said he had; and she sent John Cantally<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">A clergyman, as appears, and afterwards archdeacon of St. Andrew's See 1524, 1525, notes.</NOTE>, a confidential servant, to know his real intentions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Sept.</NOTE> Dacre replied that he must insist upon a special article for the fecurity of James; and desired a respite of twelve days, that Henry's approbation of the articles might be obtained<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">C. Cal. B. VII, 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This delay was not granted; and the chief articles of treaty on both sides being rejected, for the English the security of James from Albany's power, for the Scots the inclusion of France, the regent advanced his army to the English frontiers; and on the ninth of September it encamped at Annan<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Albany to Dacre, Annan, 9 Sept. 1522, B. VII, 138.</NOTE>. This army was one of the most numerous, and best appointed, that Scotland had ever set forth: according to repeated dispatches of Wolsey and Dacre, it consisted of not less than eighty thou∣sand
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>men, with forty-five large pieces of brass artillery, one thousand hagbuts mounted upon trestles, and a prodigious number of hand-guns: it was supplied with provisions even to superfluity<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">C. Wolsey to Henry, B. VI, 242.</NOTE>. A general terror pervaded the north of Eng∣land; the English forces were warring in France; and Wolsey, in a letter to Henry<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, observes that the capture of Carlisle, and the destruction of at least all Cumberland, seemed inevitable, as not above sixteen thousand men could have been there ar∣rayed. The English lieutenant-general, the earl of Shrews∣bury, in a dispatch to Henry, dated the eighth of September<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. B. III, 155. And see a letter of Sir Thomas More to Wolsey, con∣veying Henry's commands on the occasion, 14 Sept. B. I, 303. Yet Shrews-bury's bad health, VI, 242, was an excuse for his defective conduct.</NOTE>, shews a complete want of preparation; he mentions that, upon advice from Dacre that the Scots intended to assail the western marches, he had ordered the array to be in readiness, but that it exceeded not twenty thousand, and as no artillery nor money was sent even that number could not assemble: it being surmized that artillery could not pass Stanmore to Car∣lisle, he intended to invade Scotland on the east, and extend his ravages till he met Albany returning by the western marches: but he eagerly desires a remittance of money, with∣out which nothing, as he observes, could be done. This want of preparation probably was the cause that Shrewsbury was, in the ensuing spring, deprived of his commission, which was transferred to Surrey, a far more able general: but Wolsey the minister was unpardonable; and shewed in this, and the various ignoble incidents of Henry's reign, the talents of a pedant in long declamatory letters, while neither in them, nor in his conduct, appears one spark of real ability. Yet the cardinal was fortunately opposed to Albany; who on this
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>occasion betrayed an imbecility beyond example or belief, and justly received from Wolsey the liberal appellations of coward and fool<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">C. Wolsey to Henry, B. VI, 242.</NOTE>, when, upon one interview with Dacre, he consented to dismiss this grand and spirited army, and to sacrifice an oc∣casion never to be recalled. Nor did he thereby secure any terms to France, which had enabled him to raise and provide his large array, nor even to Scotland, or himself; but was left to bewail, in complete confusion and anguish, an unhappy day of an infatuation only known to the weakest of men.</P>
<P>The narration of the Scotish historians, concerning dissen∣sions in his army, is somewhat shaken by the absolute silence of the numerous contemporary dispatches<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Those written on the instant are only meant; for in the instructions to Clarenceux, 12 Nov. 1522, B. VI, 254, it is observed that the Scotish lords told Dacre at Salom, "that for no love, favour, desire, or fair promises, of the French king, they would in any wise attempt war against England, nor invade the same, so they might be sure to have peace of Henry." Yet this is equivocal, as they supported Albany's regency, the sole ground of the war.</NOTE>; not to mention his previous pusillanimous correspondence with Dacre. The English party was annihilated by the absence of Angus: the queen, as she confesses, had no influence: the nobles, seduced by French gold, were warmly attached to the regent, and the war: the army's affection was secured, not only by exuberance of provisions and warlike ammunition, and perhaps supplies of money, but by concessions of freedom from ward to the sons and daughters of the slain, and a gift for five years of such possessions as were only for life<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 400.</NOTE>. The singular negotia∣tion with Dacre, which terminated this inglorious expedition, remains to be narrated; and as almost every original scrap of paper, which passed on the subject between him and Albany,
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>is extant, the account is capable of extreme accuracy, and even minuteness.</P>
<P>Dacre had continued the above mentioned epistolary inter∣course with the queen, who remained at Edinburgh, and even with Albany on his march. On the seventh of September he sent to the latter the safe conduct for an envoy<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">B. VII, 137.</NOTE>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Sept.</NOTE> and Can∣tally, the queen's servant, was dispatched by Albany to Dacre on the eighth, with a stern letter<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 138.</NOTE>, accusing the English war∣den of dissimulation; of retaining Carrick herald, though sent for peace; and of sending one of his servants into the midst of the Scotish camp, who deserved death as he had no badge of truce; but the regent adds that, if Dacre be so desirous of peace, he has only to send his powers and articles by the bearer. Dacre however would not advance from Carlisle to the river Esk, to meet Cantally, as the latter proposed, the Scotish army being near, but sent him a safe conduct to Car∣lisle<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Dacre to Cantally, 8 Sept. ib. 137. Cantally to Dacre, 151.</NOTE>: on which he returned to consult Albany, who remitted him from Annan, on the ninth, with a letter<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">VII, 138.</NOTE>, promising that if Dacre sent him back with a favourable answer, for the queen's honour, the regent would listen, and pardon the war∣den's faults, "though his honour was fled." Dacre desiring dispatches in the Scotish language, as he did not understand French<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 139.</NOTE>, Cantally again went to the Scotish camp, and re∣turned, when the actual treaty commenced. Dacre, by his letter from Carlisle, dated on the ninth of September at eleven o'clock at night<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 140.</NOTE>, answers the charges of Albany thus; that the Carrick herald had opened English letters sent to Berwick, and was seized, but soon set at liberty; that Dacre's servant
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>was no spy, but carried the safe conduct sent by Henry at his sister's desire, and bore, if not a badge of truce, the cognisance of St. George, and Dacre's badge on his jacket, both before and behind: to Albany's angry attack on his character he makes no reply; but seeing the regent's desire of a month's truce, that embassadors might be sent to England for peace, he proceeds to state that he has no commission to that effect, yet he adds, "I am content to stop my sovereign lord's army, now raising and approaching the borders, and grant you your desire of one month's abstinence." He concludes with pro∣mising, as warden, that all inroads shall be stopped; and that he shall send, on safe conduct, Sir Christopher Dacre, his brother, as an hostage for the performance of the terms. Albany, in return, on the tenth, demanded a personal con∣ference; and Dacre consenting to meet at seven in the en∣suing morning, the regent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Sept.</NOTE> in a letter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">B.

It bears that, at the desire of the queen, and "also"<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This <HI>disjunctive connective</HI> is emphatic. Our historians absurdly suppose that the queen was with the army: she remained at Edinburgh; and the truce was negotiated, and signed, solely by Albany and Dacre.</NOTE> at the desire of Albany, Dacre had come to the chapel of Salom; yet this being a mere pream∣ble, the tenor of the agreement runs in the name of Albany, with the advice of the lords of the council, and Dacre: the
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>latter, as warden, grants a truce upon all the borders, for one month; all hostilities are to cease, and Dacre is to stop the advance of the English army, and to yield his brother Sir Christopher Dacre as an hostage to that effect: the queen is to be desired to intercede with Henry for another month's ab∣stinence, that the embassadors, to be sent from Scotland on the safe conduct transmitted, may prepare for their journey. By a separate minute, signed at the same time<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">B VII, 150.</NOTE>, Albany en∣gages immediately to dismiss his army; which was done ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>Such was this noted transaction<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Wolsey, in a letter to Henry, B.

After immense preparation and expence, no purpose was effected, which might not have been obtained previously to the array. The regent had only shewn, in a grand theatre, that he was the heir of that pusillanimity com∣mon to his predecessors in the title of Albany. Yet the shades of those slain at Flodden perhaps fluttered around him, and his army, and spread a panic against any engagement on English ground. It appears from all the writings, that Dacre used the terror of an approaching host to daunt the regent; and from repeated examples in this reign of James V, it is evident that the Scotish leaders were averse to enter England; and, following the advice of Robert I, esteemed a defensive war safest, and most effectual.</P>
<P>Soon after his return to Edinburgh, the regent dispatched Jehan de Barboun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 Sept.</NOTE> as his envoy to Henry and Wolsey, with instructions<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">C. B. VI, 269.</NOTE> to desire a truce till midsummer next year, and
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>that France might be comprehended: but the last article being absolutely refused, he was ordered by Albany to return with all speed<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">C. Albany to Barboun, 17 Oct. ibid. 274.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 Oct.</NOTE> During this time the queen continued her media∣tion with Dacre. Shrewsbury was sick, and the approaching winter forbade an invasion of Scotland; which was also esteemed unnecessary, as the Scotish peers were believed to be inclined to peace, and willing to give hostages for the safety of James, who was to be committed to the keeping of some independent lords, provided that Albany were allowed to remain in Scot∣land; an article not much opposed by the English minister, as, by sowing division, he hoped soon to force the regent to resign<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. Wolsey to Henry, B. VI, 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Albany, stung with the disgraceful consequences of his late infatuation, resolved to sail to France, in order to explain and palliate his conduct, to represent the indisposition of the Scots to the war; and to solicit supplies of money and warlike stores, and especially some troops who might, by their example, stimu∣late the Scots to exertion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Oct.</NOTE> He accordingly embarked at Dun∣barton, on the twenty-fifth of October, on a galley with oars, attended only by another vessel of the same description; having appointed the chancellor, Huntley, Argyle, Arran, and Gou∣zolles, a French officer, as a council of regency, under oath to attempt nothing against his own authority<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O.

<PB N="212" REF="218"/>Gouzolles denominated captain of Milan, but a special adhe∣rent of Albany, who was to share the custody of the young king, and, with a guard of thirty-three Frenchmen, was also to attend the queen<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Though Dacre in this letter, from imperfect information, seem to mention Gouzolles and the captain of Milan as distinct persons, it appears from the correspondence of Nov. 1523, B.

These offices, assigned to a foreigner, only shew that experience had not taught Albany to avoid the grossest imprudence.</P>
<P>The English court, learning the departure of Albany, dis∣patched Benolt, the Clarenceux herald, to examine, with his usual ability,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Nov.</NOTE> the state of Scotland. His instructions<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VI, 254. See also Remembrances for Clarenceux, Wolsey's hand, VI, 265.</NOTE> bore that he was to applaud the queen, in Henry's name, for the truce, to which he had only consented by her mediation; to discover if Margaret and the peers inclined to war or peace; and to advise them as they must now see, from Albany's ab∣rupt departure, that he had only been sent from France to disturb the public tranquillity, to embrace "the profitable ad∣vice of England, and forsake the perilous enchantments of France:" he was to represent that Henry regarded the war as unnatural, the Scotish king being a minor and his nephew; that, while France was only liberal of promises, a peace would open to Scotland the advantages of commerce with England, and her allies: and the herald was to offer a truce till the end of February, provided that the Scotish peers would promise to send an embassy for peace. Wolsey also instructed Clarenceux loudly to reprobate the haughty expressions used by Albany to Henry, in order as appears to excite the hatred of the Scots against the regent's pride; and the cardinal even sketched the
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>speech, which the herald was to pronounce to the Scotish peers<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Remembrances, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Albany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1523</NOTE> being informed of the arrival and residence of the English herald in Scotland, and dreading the influence which he might exert against his power and designs, sent George Hay to Wolsey, with instructions<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. VI, 240.</NOTE> dated at Vic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Jan.</NOTE> probably the town of that name in his wife's county of Auvergne. The regent represented that he had always inclined to peace, and only had recourse to arms after a cruel invasion of Scotland, and even then consented to a truce, though England was quite un∣prepared: that the proposals of Henry ought not to have been sent to the Scotish peers, but to him, as regent, who would never consent that Scotland should abandon France, even upon the terms offered by Henry; which, as reported to him, were that, on condition of this dereliction, of a truce of sixteen years with England, and the exile of Albany, Berwick and all the lands claimable by Scotland should be rendered; and a mar∣riage appointed between James and Mary the daughter of the English king; while, on refusal, cruel and lasting war was threatened. The regent further stated that the only way to peace was to address him; that, though forced to visit France on account of his wife's illness, he had left full powers to treat; that he could not repress his rage, on learning that England endeavoured to intimidate the Scots in his absence, and that, if war were unavoidable, their allies would defend them, though peace were to be wished for the good of christendom assailed by the infidels; lastly he desires a quick and immediate answer, with strict secrecy, as his present residence might ren∣der the intercourse suspicious, though it was only known to the papal legate in France, the abbot of Glenluce, and the
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>bearer. The council of regency, probably instructed by Al∣bany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Jan.</NOTE> gave an answer to Clarenceux, signed by Thomas Hay their secretary<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VIII, 96.</NOTE> bearing in vague terms that the treaty of Salom had been fulfilled on their part; and desiring complete information of the terms offered by England, if the French alliance were abandoned. No serious treaty was intended, their sole object being to procrastinate: and the liberal offers mentioned by Albany, not appearing in any instructions to Clarenceux which have reached us, seem to have been oral promises, meant to amuse and decoy.</P>
<P>Henry, finding the negotiation very precarious, issued a commission of lieutenant-general against the Scots to Thomas Howard earl of Surrey<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIII, 781.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Feb.</NOTE> son of the victor at Flodden now duke of Norfolk, and of a name terrible to Scotland. Over the western frontiers Dacre presided with his usual ability: while the marquis of Dorset was appointed warden of the eastern marches. Surrey was empowered not only to manage war, but to extend the negotiations, as long as any hope of success remained.</P>
<P>Nevertheless some incursions were made by the English; and one, in particular, of considerable importance, into the Merse and Tividale.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 April</NOTE> Buchanan informs us that Surrey, at the head of ten thousand men, ravaged these provinces, with a destruction which equally levelled the turreted castle of the baron, and the straw-built hut of the labourer<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Buch.

He says Dorset and others led the expedition, by Surrey's command: and that 4000 cattle were seized by the English.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On his return to Berwick Surrey sent to Wolsey an account of his expedition by a messenger, whom he also charged with
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>instructions for the cardinal and council. The messenger is desired to narrate every circumstance of the late inroad into Tividale, to shew the bad state of the cavalry, and the want of forage in Northumberland, the deficiency of carriages for provisions, and of horses to draw the artillery. If an impor∣tant invasion be intended, the English general desires that four thousand Germans be demanded from their ally the emperor, so that instead of thirty thousand English, he may have but twenty two thousand, with four thousand Germans to be shipped from Flanders to Berwick; for, should Albany bring any foreign power, an invasion of Scotland must be attended with a battle, and the foreign pikes could only be encountered by pikes; while the English array, not accustomed to the order of battle, might learn from the example of the Ger∣mans<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>The inroads were mutually continued for some months. Dacre again led his bands against Kelso;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> and gave to the flames what remains of that unfortunate town his devastation of the former year had spared. Even the abbey was injured; and many villages beyond Kelso were levelled with the ground: while eight hundred French, sent by Albany, remained in a dastardly security at Edinburgh<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">C.

<P>Yet the negotiations, conducted by the queen and Surrey, became more and more important in their progress.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> It was proposed to place the young king solemnly on the throne, and to terminate the regency by proclaiming his actual exercise of power; while the queen, with a chosen council, should manage the public affairs.

<P>This important negotiation is thus minutely stated, because unknown to former writers, who only narrate its success after Albany's departure, in the following year. But a more active scene now opens, in Surrey's invasion of Scotland, the arrival of Albany, and his second disgraceful expedition against Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Surrey's detail of his expedition, conveyed in a dispatch to Wolsey<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Same to same, 27 Sept. B. II, 24, a long and important letter.</NOTE>, shall be exactly followed in the account of this event. The English advanced from Berwick to Jedburgh, amid con∣stant skirmishes with the Scots; "I assure your grace," says Surrey to the cardinal, "that I found the Scots at this time the boldest men, and the most ardent, that ever I beheld of
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>any nation<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">"I assure your grace I found the Scotts, at this time, the boldest men, and the hotest, that ever I sawe any nacion." The praise from Surrey is great, as he had often been employed on severe foreign service.</NOTE>;" their conflicts were perpetual, though they amounted only to about fifteen hundred, hastily gathered by the border chieftains, against an army of nine thousand, al∣most entirely cavalry; and were forty thousand such valiant men assembled, proceeds the English general, dreadful would be the encounter. But all their efforts could not prevent the pillage of Tividale, and the conflagration of the fair town of Jedburgh, containing at that time twice as many houses as Berwick, many of them of beautiful architecture; it was de∣fended by six strong towers, and was capable of receiving a garrison of one thousand cavalry. Sir William Bulmer and Sir Thomas Tempest conducted the strong detachment, which captured the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Sept.</NOTE> and gave it completely to the flames, so that a reedification was necessary before it could be inhabited. But this achievement was followed by an unexpected and strange disaster, on the side of the English. Their camp was surrounded with the provision waggons, and a ditch: but while Surrey was engaged in the assault of the abbey, which lasted till two hours after night fell, Dacre had, for some unknown cause, stationed his cavalry without the precinct of the camp. Next day Surrey sent Dacre to attack the castle of Ferniherst,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Sep.</NOTE> along with Sir Arthur Darcy and Sir Marmaduke Constable; but that hold being surrounded with a wood was well defended, and before it yielded, many on both sides were slain and wounded. On his return Dacre resumed his former station on the outside of the camp; and about eight o'clock, while he sat at supper with Surrey, the horses of his cavalry broke loose; and, running around the camp, spread an universal alarm, as it was supposed the Scots were assaulting the entrenchments;
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>and many guns, and not less than an hundred sheaves of ar∣rows were discharged at them. Of fifteen hundred horses, thus running wild, not seven hundred were saved: about five hundred were shot, or wandered in divers directions; two hundred and fifty ran into Jedburgh, still in flames, where they were seized and carried off by Scotish women; fifty plunged to death down a precipice. It is risible to find Surrey an honest and credulous soldier, seriously imputing this disaster to daemons. He affirms that Dacre, and all his men, beheld "spirits and fearful signs" six times that night; and that the whole array believe that the infernal prince was six times among them. It was apparently a stratagem of the Scots, as their women were ready to seize what horses they could; nor is such a stratagem against cavalry, unknown in a former period of Scotish history<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In 1377. Fordun, II, 385.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After dispatching his envoy to Wolsey with an account of this expedition, Surrey was, on the same day, surprized with the intelligence that Albany had arrived in Scotland on the twenty fourth of September, the fatal day of Jedburgh<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. Surrey to Wolsey, 27 Sept. B. VI, 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The queen had thus arranged her above mentioned scheme of seizing the regency, on pretence of placing her son on the throne: the young king was to go to the tolbooth of Edin∣burgh, as from his own will, and to chuse a council, for many wished his freedom, though none had the boldness to at∣tempt it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O.

<PB N="222" REF="228"/>Malignes and Thomas Hay produced letters from Albany, de∣siring that the king might remain at Stirling, as he had ship∣ped in Picardy on his voyage, and De la Pole, a pretender to the English throne, was to follow him<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

Upon which intel∣ligence the lords commanded Erskine to withdraw from his charge, and surrender the custody of the king to Cassils and Fleming, the bishop of Galloway and the abbot of Cambus∣kenneth, with a mandate that he be permitted to ride at his pleasure, on condition that he returned to Stirling at night, a liberty esteemed hazardous by the French embassador<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Throlkeld's letter above quoted.

A few days after this transaction Albany arrived in the firth of Clyde<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The connection of the narrative has occasioned the omission of some minute particulars, which shall be thrown into this note. Henry, understanding Al∣bany's intention to return to Scotland, sent Sir William Fitzwilliams with thirty six large ships, to watch the French shores; while Antony Pointz with a squadron cruized in the western seas, and Sherborn in the northern. In August Fitzwilliams discovered twelve French ships, aboard of which were Gawin Dunbar archbishop of Glasgow, and other persons of rank: these vessels being pursued returned to France, and two were lost. Albany upon this ordered his stores to be relanded, and spread a report that his voyage was deferred till the next spring. Fitzwilliams being deceived returned to port, and Albany's arrival was wholly unexpected by the English.

<P>The tide of French gold, which flowed on the regent's arrival, again set on float in his favour the hesitating resolutions of most of the peers. The others were struck with consterna∣tion, on beholding his sumptuous preparations, and the pomp of war which shone around his person, though they knew that the lion's formidable garb only arrayed a deer. The queen, conscious of her conduct, was seized with dismay, and earnestly desired to be received into England<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. Margaret to Surrey, B.

<P>As the foreign troops would soon exhaust their provisions, and the Scots were little disposed to support the expence of their maintenance, the regent's first care was to lead them into actual service: and, by the consent of the parliament, a proclamation of array was issued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">beg.

Berwick had been put into a strong state of defence by Henry VII, but had since fallen into much neglect: it was a mile and three quarters in circumference; and would have required a garrison of six thousand, instead of the small number allotted: a pestilence now raged in the town; there were two great breaches in the wall, to the extent of eighty feet; and its defence Surrey re∣presents as impracticable, for Albany might raise thirty thou∣sand valiant men of Tividale, and other southern counties, and make a sudden attack, while Northumberland could hardly muster two thousand five hundred: the sole hope was that, as the moon had waned three days, Albany would not advance, contrary to the practice of the times<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O.

England expected a sanguinary contest, and disdained not to mingle apprehensions with her hope: but the letters of Wolsey to Surrey, during this crisis, now excite only a smile, while we observe the pedantic cardinal, in epistles of seven or eight leaves, divided into heads like sermons, in∣structing one of the most able generals of his age in the art of war, and in the management of a campaign. His pride uni∣formly blends the king's orders, and opinions, with his own;

With more wisdom he desires that no truce be granted, if required by the regent; as this favour might tend to reconcile the Scots to his presence, by his re∣deeming them from the calamities of war; while England could allow of no terms, except the exile of Albany, and the solemn assumption of the power by James<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Surrey, learning that Albany's host was assembled, and prepared to march, detached the Marquis of Dorset to Aln∣wick, and Darcy to Bamborough, with about nine thousand men, besides the array of Northumberland; and, if Albany directed his attack to Berwick, they had orders to garrison the town with all their division<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O.

The whole army appears to have amounted to about fifty thousand, and was eager to invade Scotland; but Henry's orders to the general bore that he should advance no further than the banner

<P>The Scotish host assembled at the usual place, the Burrow∣muir near Edinburgh, to the amount of sixty thousand men: and the regent slowly conducted their march to Melrose, re∣tarded by cumbersome artillery, and by roads rendered deep and difficult by recent falls of snow and rain<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">O.

While his numerous host so much despoiled the south of Scot∣land, that seven years would not repair the damage, Albany's only concern was for the broken axle-trees of five or six of his carriages for artillery; an incident which excited his irascibility to a violent degree. When Albany was at Lauder on his march, Sir Antony Ughtred, captain of Berwick, wrote to Surrey for a reinforcement.

<P>The regent having repeated, in a council of the peers, his intention of passing to France, it was demanded by them that, if he did not return by the first of September, his office should be considered as expired, and the sceptre placed in the hands of the king<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. I, 352, 355.</NOTE>. Despised by the chiefs, detested by the people, Albany had no intention to revisit a country, in which he had only met with unexampled vexations, and disgraces; and to which his presence, like the return of a comet, had only brought dismay and calamity: he therefore assented to this de∣mand. But he insisted upon a promise that the lords would abide by the alliance with France, concluded at Rouen by the bishops of Dunkeld and Ross and secretary Panter, in fifteen

He desired to leave Gouzolles, as his treasurer; and that nothing of moment should be done, without the consent of that foreigner. The peers demurred<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He required forty thousand crowns of the sun, to defray the expence of his voyage to France, and to be repaid at Dieppe to the Scotish merchants. Refused<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. After carrying off many of the royal artillery of Scotland aboard his vessels, and com∣mitting the rest, with the custody of the castle of Dunbar, a key of the kingdom, to Gouzolles, (who retained it with his French garrison for about twelve years after, and at first even pretended to interfere in the affairs of the kingdom,) Albany took his final leave at Dunbarton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 May</NOTE> on the twentieth day of May, loaden with the execrations of a people, oppressed by his exactions, and stung with the ignominy of his government<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 23, fixes the day of his departure. Dacre, 30 May, B. II, 205, mentions it as having taken place at Dunbarton. The other particulars appear from original letters, quoted under the years 1528 and 1536. Dacre informs Wolsey, 11 June, B. II, 306, that Albany, (who bore the title and arms of lord of Man,) wished to attack that isle on his return to France, but the soldiers engaged for the purpose would not proceed.
<P>In Cal. B. II, 285, is given an abstract of nineteen letters, written about this time. They mention that Albany had left great power to Lennox, and had given him the abbey of Dryburgh, on condition that he acted as warden of the borders; and that Lennox gave it to James Stuart. From them it also appears that many Scotish peers had not only pensions from France, but even velvets, and silks, from the French king's wardrobe.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the absence of Albany, James Beton archbishop of St. Andrew's, and chancellor of the kingdom, possessed for two months the chief influence; a prelate whose character not a little resembled that of Cardinal Beton, his nephew, and suc∣cessor in the metropolitan see and the chancery. The epis∣copal
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>robe, the garb of sanctity and humility, served only as a cloke to all the passions of the man of the world: his pride and ambition were unbounded, his dissimulation profound, to his duplicity no principle was sacred.</P>
<P>No sooner had Albany departed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> than the scheme projected before his last arrival for placing the chief power ostensibly in the hands of the king, now only in his twelfth year, but really in those of a council under the controul of England, was revived with speedy success. The queen's late dereliction of her brother, at a critical period, was not forgotten; and the English cabinet resolved to trust her no further than should be found convenient; and, if any new duplicity should appear, to transfer the direction of affairs to Angus, whose influence in Scotland was very great, and who had long been attached to the English interest, and had in his exile corresponded with Henry<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See a holograph letter from Angus to Henry, in French, dated Paris 8 May, Cal. B. III, 305, expressing gratitude and service.</NOTE>. But as Margaret was adored by the Scotish nation, to whom she was endeared by her constant mediations for peace, by her character of widow of their favourite monarch, and mother of a young king, always the object of warm hopes and affections, it was expedient that she should act a principal part in this grand exhibition. The earl of Surrey, now duke of Norfolk by the death of his father<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Which happened on the 21st May 1524. Dugd. Bar.</NOTE>, continued in the northern regions of England, in his character of lieutenant general, in order to overawe any opposition by the dread of an instanta∣neous array and invasion, while Margaret exerted every art to gain over many of the peers from Albany's interest; nor did she labour without success, for, in a letter to her brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 July</NOTE> she assures him that several had acceded to her cause<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. I, 283.</NOTE>. Arran
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>who, being nearly allied to the throne, had long aspired to the regency against Albany, but was of doubtful affection to the English interest, now resolved to unite his pretensions with those of the queen: and, in the absence of Angus, their union was irresistible in Scotland, and, in the depression of the French influence, was exposed to little hazard from external force, or from the few remaining adherents of that faction. Margaret, confirmed in her resolutions by the accession of Arran, re∣solved to put them in execution without the aid of England; as by this mode of conduct she would increase her own im∣portance, in the eyes of Henry and of Europe; and was at the same time certain that Henry would warmly support a scheme, which he had eagerly desired. Nor was this spirited princess free from a portion of that independent pride, which had animated the bosom of her husband James IV: she wished Scotland to be regarded as a kingdom above all foreign con∣troul; and herself to be treated as a queen, and not as a dele∣gate of cardinal Wolsey, whom she seems to have cordially hated and despised; nor was her good opinion of her brother increased by his infatuated devotion to that pedantic and un∣principled churchman. But this spirit was little agreeable to the tyrannical temper of the cardinal, who was afterwards to find in Angus a more submissive deputy for the management of Scotland. Yet had Wolsey been a politician, a character he falsely assumed, he must have foreseen that the violent manner, in which the English interest was exerted under Angus, would tend completely to alienate the young king from England, as actually happened; while his mother's independent measures, joined with her natural attachment to her country, would have formed the basis of an inclination, lasting, because the produce of reason and liberty; while his constrained and degrading submission terminated, as usual, in hatred. At this
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>time his love to England formed a part of his filial affections: on his release, at the end of three years, from the chains of Angus, rivetted by the haughty hands of Henry and Wolsey, he was to nourish an enmity never to be eradicated; which exposed him to the designs of the clergy attached to France, embittered his life, and was the cause of his untimely death in the very prime of his age.</P>
<P>Margaret, eager to obtain a power which she did not foresee was not to last many months, had only to revive her arrange∣ment of last year, and put it in immediate execution, which Arran's assistance rendered no longer difficult. Accordingly, while Wolsey and Norfolk continued to doubt, but liberally promised every aid and supply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 July</NOTE> the queen suddenly left Stirling with her son, and a few attendants, and proceeded to Edin∣burgh, where the young monarch was received with acclama∣tions and tears of joy<NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">Less. 412.</NOTE>. Amid the mutual congratulations of the people, the degrading minority, which had proved so ruinous to the nation, was ended; behold a sovereign, young but wise above his years! behold the heir of an ancient line of kings, at length rescued from the hands of wicked ambition! behold the son of James IV, the valiant, the magnificent, our protector, our father! With such sounds of joy was the royal procession attended to the palace of Holyroodhouse: and pro∣clamations being immediately issued in the name of James, and due notifications sent of his assumption of his own autho∣thority, the well-affected peers crowded to his presence; while the others remained in silent consternation, any opposition being liable to a charge of rebellion. So easily did one day accom∣plish what to the preceding seemed impossible.</P>
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
<P>Many of the lords, spiritual and temporal, immediately en∣tered into an engagement, to support the king's assumption of the power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 July</NOTE> The original bond is yet extant, and bears that, as the king had proceeded from Stirling to take the sceptre, they promise to be loyal servants, and to support his authority or that used by deputies in his name, notwithstanding any profession they have made to Albany; nay they formally annul any engagement they have entered into with Albany, and quash and dissolve his regency, so that James may freely exert the entire sovereignty: and they promise that, in the next parliament, they shall pronounce the termination of Albany's government. This important instrument is signed by the bishops of Galloway and Ross, the abbots of Holyroodhouse, Scone and Paisley, the earls of Arran, Lennox, Crawford, Murray, Morton, Cassils, the lords Erskine, Fleming, Borth∣wick, Livingston, Avandale, and many others<NOTE N="8" PLACE="marg">O.

Among the lesser names are Mr. Francis Bothwell, provost of Edinburgh; and a baillie, the dean of Gild, and the treasurer of that city.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king, or rather Margaret, then took possession of the castle of Edinburgh, and probably appointed a new captain. As in that capital the parliaments were held, and it was essen∣tial that the magistracy should be devoted to the present go∣vernment, the queen removed the provost from his office, which, at her instance, was conferred on lord Maxwell<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Less. 413. Gouzolles in a letter to Albany, Sept. 1524, B. III, 90, says Maxwell was made provost on the 20th of August.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James was now instated in the sovereignty; and his minority was in future to be uncurbed by any regency. But as Mar∣garet, and afterwards the chancellor and Angus, were in fact,
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>though not in name, regents, for the four succeeding years, or till July one thousand five hundred and twenty eight; and it would be as contrary to historical rules, as to the civil law, to consider a boy aged twelve years and three months as an uncontrouled sovereign, while the most early majority of a monarch was computed at fourteen years; the termination of the power of Angus, when James was in his seventeenth year, shall be regarded as the commencement of the actual and in∣dependent authority of this king. Yet, as he now appears as an actor on the stage of history, some features of his nonage shall be here given, from contemporary evidence, reserving the marked character of his life and reign, according to the plan followed in this work, till he assume the decided direc∣tion of the national affairs, ever subject to the influence of the monarch's individual conduct. In person, countenance, and manner, if we believe the English embassadors, James very much resembled his uncle Henry<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus and Ratcliffe to Wolsey, 15 Nov. 1524. B. VI, 333.</NOTE>; he displayed a spirit and firmness above his age, but not unusual in minor kings, accus∣tomed from infancy to be treated with the respect and defer∣ence, due to manly sentiment and action. He rode well, tilted at the glove with a spear not unskilfully, sung with force and precision, danced with elegance; and his conversation did honour to his preceptor Gawin Dunbar, a man of science, being replete with masculine sense and information<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In nothing would he permit himself to be regarded as a boy. Dr. Magnus, in requesting Wolsey to send an ornamented buckler to James, who desired to have one, on hearing that his uncle sometimes used that piece of defensive armour, informs the cardinal that it must be of manly size, for the young king had no puerile
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>weapon nor decoration; even his sword being a yard long before the hilt, and yet he could draw it as well as any man<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 31 May, 1525, B. II, 35.</NOTE>. With hawks and hounds he was delighted<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Same to same, 31 March 1525, B. VII, 3.</NOTE>: nor was he a stranger to any noble exercise or amusement. But one other extract of a letter from Magnus to Wolsey must not be omitted, "It is suspected that his inclination will be much inclined to cruelty, for when the queen's grace taketh displeasure against any of the lords, or others, then she procureth the said young king to be sad, heavy, and pensive, to look down and frown upon them, and to hold unto them some sore and sharp words<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The queen's sudden production of her son anticipated the plan projected by Wolsey and Norfolk to that effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Aug.</NOTE> which was, that the chancellor of Scotland should be intercepted by means of a pretended conference on the borders, and compelled to acknowledge the sovereignty of James, that Norfolk should then press the queen to accomplish the scheme, offer her sums to the amount of two thousand pounds to bribe the peers; and his army, if force were necessary: that, it being better, as Wolsey coarsely expresses himself, to have two strings to the bow, especially when one was made by a woman's fingers, if Margaret were averse, Norfolk was himself to enforce the acknowledgment of James by fire and sword: but, if she con∣sented, the guard of two hundred men, to be paid at Henry's expence, desired by her and Arran, for the security of the king's person, should be granted; Angus, as they also requested, should not be permitted to visit Scotland, except by the queen's favour. The whole power of Henry was promised in support of the enterprize; and as James had been left by his avaricious uncle the regent in great penury, one thousand nobles were to
<PB N="241" REF="247" MS="y"/>be remitted to him, two hundred marks to the queen, one hundred pounds to Arran, merely as an earnest of similar fa∣vours in future<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Upon the unexpected tidings that the scheme was accom∣plished, the English guard, and the presents were transmitted: it was desired that an embassy of peace should be sent to London, as an honourable proceeding towards Henry:<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 Aug.</NOTE> and Wolsey warmly recommended that James Beton, archbishop of St. Andrew's, chancellor, and Gawin Dunbar bishop of Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Aug.</NOTE> who continued obstinate in their adherence to Al∣bany's authority, should be silenced by imprisonment, or other∣wise<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>A truce with England, of about three months, was con∣cluded at Berwick by Norfolk and Cassils<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV, 21.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Sept.</NOTE> but the arrange∣ment of a solemn embassy from Scotland, as stipulated, re∣quired more time for preparation. Meanwhile the queen had remitted to Henry some articles, expected by her and Arran: she represented her necessity of supplies, for the greater part of the offices of state being in her hands, she was obliged to defray all expences, and Albany had given away most of the king's property to the chief peers: for Arran the garter, and a pension, were required<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">C. 31 Aug. B. I, 218.</NOTE>; and the other terms were esteemed haughty and covetous by the English cabinet. But some com∣pliance was necessary, for a favourite part of Wolsey's scheme remained to be accomplished. To secure the prelates of St. Andrew's and Aberdeen, the cardinal's violent and unprincipled politics considered it as essential that they should be sent, in disguise, and with great secresy, to Berwick, under a strong guard, to be imprisoned in England: he warmly represents the advantages of this measure, the profit to the scanty royal treasury by the confiscation of their property, the dangers to be by this mean frustrated, the confirmation given by terror to the queen's government, the despair with which it would impress Albany, and all his adherents<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">O.

But the queen, wishing to preserve terms with France and the regent, who might, in the revolutions of human affairs, again lend their friendship, when
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>that of England failed, was averse to such a decisive measure; and was contented with retaining the prelates in captivity. Gouzolles, the captain of Dunbar, not only informed Albany of all the transactions by letters, some of which being inter∣cepted by England are yet extant<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">C. B. I, 47, and B.

<P>Arran had already, perhaps with the connivance of the queen, sent an envoy to the French monarch, desiring a con∣tinuance of the alliance: nor do they seem to have hesitated to sound Francis, on the price he would pay for their services, if they abandoned England<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The envoy to France appears to have been David Beton, afterwards car∣dinal; for his return, and the commission to Gouzolles are mentioned together in a letter Magnus to Wolsey, 17 Dec.

They import that he thanked the king, and states, for their desire to continue the alliance; that he was satisfied with their conduct to Albany; that he was concerned that he could not remit money, nor send Albany, who was prevented from returning at the appointed time, by the disease and death of his wife; and the season was now too far ad∣vanced; so that they must temporize till next year, when Albany might be better prepared, and France more free from difficulties, of which, Francis unprophetically adds, "there is the greatest appearance, not to say certainty<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">"Et y est l'apparance bien grande, et come chose presque asseurée."</NOTE>." He proceeds
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>to state that he remains well disposed to a marriage treaty be∣tween James and his daughter, as settled by the treaty of Rouen, which he hopes they will observe as he has ever done: and he concludes with mentioning that Angus had secretly withdrawn from France, without his knowledge, or that of Albany; and that he ought of course to be regarded as devoted to England, and as a rebel. In his letter to the king<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. B.

Norfolk at the same time advised<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. Norfolk to Wolsey, 10 Oct. B.

A fit style to be addressed to a so∣vereign and independent princess! Norfolk, at the same time, desired Magnus to stop all further payments, as the English council, enraged at the queen's conduct, had resolved to sup∣port Angus; a letter from Henry to the Scotish peers was threatened if she persisted; and the embassador was desired to deliver the above recited letter, and to thunder in her ears the open enmity of Henry in case of her obstinacy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">C.

<PB N="253" REF="259"/>Otterburn one of the most learned and experienced men in Scotland, were all well affected to England: that the queen was very ill advised, but that the parliament, which was to meet next monday, might perhaps arrange the public affairs; that Robert Barton the comptroller, who enjoyed much of Margaret's favour, had attempted to sow discord by complain∣ing of the capture of a Scotish ship by the English; that she even desired Magnus and Ratcliffe to depart; and the novelty of their residence rather excited the jealousy even of the lords, whose power appears, from various parts of this dispatch, to have been regarded as equal to that of the queen.

<P>During the second week of this parliament, on wednesday the twenty-third of November, at four o'clock in the morning, the earls of Angus and Lennox, the <HI>master</HI> or heir of Kilmauris, Scot of Buccleugh not long since liberated, and other chiefs,
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>with their followers, suddenly advanced to Edinburgh; and at that dead hour of winter a part scaled the walls, and opened the gates to the rest, when the whole body, to the amount of about four hundred men, advanced to the cross in the centre of the city, and proclaimed that they came as good subjects. Angus and his friends afterwards proceeded to the council of state, consisting of the chancellor, the bishops of Aberdeen and Dunkeld, Argyle, and other temporal peers, and desired them to take the guardianship of the young king.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the castle began to discharge its artillery on the city, in order to expell the party of Angus; while the bishop of Aberdeen, and the abbot of Cambuskenneth, proceeded with Magnus the English embassador to the abbey, to beseech the queen's orders to stop the fire of the fortress. They there found several peers, with four of five hundred followers, armed with hagbuts, and prepared to assault Angus. The queen admitted the bishop and abbot, but ordered the embassador to retire, which he did, not without danger, as one ball had slain two tradesmen, a woman, and a priest. Angus injured none; and upon receiving an order in the name of his sovereign, he left the capital with his party, at four in the afternoon, and with∣drew to Dalkeith. After his departure, Margaret and the king her son proceeded, by torch-light, from the abbey to the castle, where they remained, accompanied only by the secre∣tary of Albany, and by Murray, who was warmly devoted to the French faction<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>The English embassadors seem to narrate this as an unex∣pected event<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Yet Sir Robert Barton, the comptroller, had notice of a plot, in a letter from Rothes, signed, "Rede and Ryve," (Read and Tear this letter, destroy it,) C.

<PB N="255" REF="261"/>by Wolsey, it is probable that it was an impulse of resentment, occasioned by the exclusion of Angus and Lennox from the national council, or perhaps by some measures therein agitated against them, or their friends. It however appears that the chancellor, finding Albany's authority annulled by his nonappearance before the first of September, and considered as terminated by two successive parliaments, resolved to form a coalition with the party of Angus, as the only method by which he could hope to support himself against the queen, who had injured him beyond hopes of concord; and his affinity with Arran only increased his sentiments of vengeance against an insult, in which that nobleman had joined with Margaret. Angus, now hopeless of reconcilement with the queen his wife, would eagerly listen to the proposals of the richest man in Scotland, and whose power he himself could alone equal<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">The ear'dom of Fife had been assigned to him by Albany, VI, 405. The English embassadors, II, 255, expressly mention his opulence, as superior to that of any Scotish subject.</NOTE>: and the plan, at the same time that it preserved inviolate the chancellor's pride and independence, and prevented the odious charge of his open dereliction of Albany to embrace the Eng∣lish interest, also offered to Angus the surest means of sup∣porting that interest, and the noblest, as, by a consolidation of internal power, it emancipated him from the capricious vio∣lence of Wolsey, an object of detestation even to the English peers, and to every ingenuous mind. This powerful coalition gradually undermined the party of Margaret and Arran, by steps presently to be described; and assuming the custody of the king, and the supreme power, continued in vigour for two years, till Angus, usurping all the authority, only hastened his own fall. The epoch of its commencement is therefore
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>of importance; and is clearly ascertained from the dispatch above narrated.</P>
<P>The queen and Arran, terrified by this unexpected event, could now only hope to maintain the ascendant by Henry's support,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 Nov.</NOTE> and hastened the embassy into England, consisting of the earl of Cassils, Robert Cockburn bishop of Dunkeld, and the abbot of Cambuskenneth.

She remonstrates against Henry's conduct, in permitting Angus to enter Scotland, and in soliciting the pope to assign Coldingham to his brother Wil∣liam, to the prejudice of her son's prerogative. The embas∣sadors proceeding to the borders adjusted with Dacre a truce of two months<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV, 28.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Nov.</NOTE> and then passed to London, where the ne∣gotiations, perplexed with difficulties, were extended to great length; nor could the marriage be accomplished: but brief truces, and afterwards extended treaties, were to prolong the peace between the realms, with but one short interruption,

<P>To evince to Henry the sincerity of their conduct, Margaret and Arran charged Marchmont herald to proceed to France, with instructions, and with letters to Francis and Albany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Dec.</NOTE> no∣tifying that as the latter had not returned before the first of September, as stipulated, the three estates had, in solemn par∣liament, annulled his authority, and transferred the direction of affairs to the queen and a council: and desiring that Albany would restore the artillery lodged in the castle of Dunbar: and that Francis would consider the distresses which the Scotish commerce suffered upon his account, being expelled from England, Flanders, and Spain, and interrupted even in visit∣ing France by the numerous hostile vessels<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Epist.

<P>Amid these contests the nation relapsed into disorder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1525 Jan.</NOTE> and the people were exposed to constant rapine and assassination<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

The chancellor and Angus continued to insist that the king should be ruled by a council appointed by the three estates. They had withdrawn to St. Andrew's; and concerted the boldest and most decisive measures against the queen. Cassils, in the mean time, had returned from London for fresh in∣structions; and Margaret sent to her brother some articles<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. VIII, 18.</NOTE>,
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>bearing that Henry must engage to wed his daughter to James when she became fourteen years of age, for on no other ground would the Scotish peers consent to abandon France: that, as the chancellor had openly declared against her, and half the realm was on his side, she desired that Norfolk might advance ten thousand men to the frontiers; that money might be sent to her and her son, while an agent on the borders should retain three thousand pounds, to defray the expence of a guard around James; that artillery and powder should be remitted, as Albany had transferred those of Scotland to Dunbar: she concludes, with her usual openness, that to Henry alone would she offer such terms. But, though the English monarch eagerly wished the marriage, he could not listen to such proposals, which he evidently saw were only extorted by the necessity of Margaret's affairs. Gouzolles the French embassador, by his residence at court, prevented many explanations between the queen and Magnus: but his national petulance began to give disgust; and one day, when Margaret was indisposed, he used such improper freedom among her ladies, that the spirit of Henry Stuart, her minion, was forced to interpose, by sending a message to the embassador instantly to leave the chamber, else he would throw him down stairs<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>Margaret in vain endeavoured, by the mediation of Robert Barton the lord comptroller, to detach the bishop of Aberdeen
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>from the confederated lords at St. Andrew's.

At the same time, as Cassils had brought from Wolsey to the chancellor a large promise, that, if he em∣braced the English interest, he should be appointed legate of Scotland, with the power of confirming all abbacies as Wolsey had in England<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">C.

In a private letter<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. Archbishop of St. Andrew's to <HI>my lord</HI> of Cambuskenneth (the abbot,) B.

The castle did not open its fire on the city, as was apprehended, the peers attached to Margaret beginning to wish for concord: Arran had a generous mind incapable of deadly enmity; Mur∣ray expected in marriage the daughter of Angus and the queen, and the ward of Huntley a young peer of extensive possessions; Eglinton was aged, and had only sought refuge in the castle as, on account of the slaughter of his son in the skirmish of 1520, a feud existed between his family and that of Angus: Cassils expected to be appointed by parliament one of the peers attendant on the king; the archbishop of Glasgow, and the bishop of Ross, were notoriously addicted to the French faction, and lent but a dubious support to Margaret; Maxwell was sincerely attached to James, and expected the abbey of Melrose for his son, or some kinsman<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O.

<PB N="264" REF="270"/>that, though an embassy had been sent to Henry, nothing should be done, except France were comprehended: she de∣sires to know what aid she may expect from that kingdom, for she cannot agree with Angus: and if France will assist her, she will embrace the interests of that country, and shall in the mean time provide that no peace be made with England, till an answer be given: that, rather than be reconciled to Angus as her brother desires, she will leave Scotland: and she con∣cludes with requesting strict secrecy, and that her letters be not remitted to England, as had been done on a former occa∣sion. From these letters Albany seized an opportunity to in∣struct one Octavian, his agent at Rome, to represent to the pontiff that he was still acknowledged regent of Scotland<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Do the following expressions of Albany proceed from misinformation, or an intention to mislead?

It is impossible to vindicate the conduct of Margaret upon this occasion, for it was nefarious in an eminent degree. To gratify her resentments against her brother, and her avarice of French gold, she attempts to pro∣mote a civil war; she offers to sacrifice the best interests of her son, the eternal advantages of his kingdom. This depravity must have stung her to the soul, when, in the course of a short week or two, she had occasion to reflect that it was gra∣tuitous and vain; as, within two days after the date of the instructions, Francis was lamenting in captivity the rash field of Pavia, which threatened the ruin of his kingdom, and was
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>for years to prevent such exertions in Scotland as Margaret desired.</P>
<P>The agreement between the queen and the lords was no sooner adjusted, than a parliament met at Edinburgh.

Keith's Hist. App. 9, 10. Craw. Off. 67. Less. 416.</NOTE>. Several other favours were also granted to Margaret; but her authority henceforth be∣came more nominal than real, the favour of Henry, its sole support, being transferred to the peers. Nor could the event be otherwise, when she pertinaciously opposed her brother's warmest wish, the marriage treaty and perpetual peace; and even behaved to Magnus his embassador with contempt or neglect, except when she could procure money from no other source<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>In another letter from Beton to Wolsey, 29 March, B.

He requires a larger safe conduct, with power to pass to other realms and to Rome; a form which he must have known could not be granted.</P></NOTE> that the young king was led astray by favourites, and his education was in many points become defective: but that his own endeavours should not be wanting to promote the peace; for which pur∣pose he offered to take the embassy on himself, and desired a safe conduct for himself and a hundred attendants; he at the same time reminded Wolsey of the promised dignities, and ex∣pressed his obligations that the archbishop of Glasgow had not been supported, in his claim of exemption from the metropoli∣tan see.</P>
<P>While James, and some peers of the council, made a pro∣gress of justice on the north of the Tay, the chancellor and Angus remained at Edinburgh to repress the disorders of the frontiers<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O.

But for this neglect there were more cogent causes than her attachment to France. Henry, irritated beyond measure at her private conduct, in endeavouring a divorce, and in her indecent love for Henry Stuart; and at her public, in thwarting all his schemes for a lasting peace with Scotland; indulged his imperious temper in a letter, replete with indignation and contempt. So poignant were its expressions that, on opening it, the tears gushed into her eyes; she could hardly read; and, after weeping for an hour, she said, "such a letter was never written to a noble woman;" she then informed Magnus that she would receive no more letters from her brother, except in a placid style, for such another would prove her death. Her duplicity in vain disavowed all attachment to France, or Albany. She answered Henry with patient remonstrances, being always too submissive in adversity, and too haughty in prosperity: her divorce she represented as beyond her power to prevent, the papal man∣dates being arrived, and the plea in an advanced state<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>The chancellor was little sincere in his pretensions of pro∣ceeding as embassador to England; and to cover his guile he desired safe conducts in a form which could not be granted.

Nay, in the parliament which was held in July this year, she refused to come to Edinburgh, in order to ratify a recent truce, as president of the council of state, though security was offered
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>for her safety; upon which it was openly proposed to deprive her of her authority: but James laudably answered, in her de∣fence, that the fault was too light for such a punishment, and that her signature might be delayed.

<P>The perpetual peace between England and France extin∣guished for a time the hopes and pursuits of the French faction,

His intrigues were however no longer necessary to maintain the superiority of the English influence in Scotland. Margaret was to retain but for a few months of the succeeding year the presidency of the secret council, and the nominal chief power: the chancellor and Angus, whose ascendant succeeded, were to manifest more firm devotion to England.</P>
<P>In vain did the queen and Arran,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1526</NOTE> to whose views of esta∣blishing a connection with France the pacification with Eng∣land was destructive, use every effort to defeat the completion of that transaction. Margaret's enmity to her brother was ex∣treme; nor did the alliance, which he had just concluded with France, prevent her from endeavouring to kindle a war between England and Scotland, by which alone she could hope to de∣stroy the English influence which supported her enemies. Ar∣ran, though in appearance reconciled to Angus, remained firmly attached to Margaret; and shared her resentment against Henry, whose confidence he had never won, and whom he

Nor was their faction unformidable, the queen having secured the attachment of Murray, now the most powerful peer in the north; while Arran was already joined by Eglinton, Ross, Sempil, Evandale, Home, and others<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, Edin. 11 Jan. 1526, Cal. B. II, 114. O. Angus to Magnus, 20 Jan. B. II, 249. O. Ottirburn to Magnus, 19 Jan. ib. 250.</NOTE>. The latter peers advanced to Lintithgow, with their followers, to the amount of four or five thousand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Jan.</NOTE> where they awaited the arrival of Margaret and Murray for some days; and at the same time probably expected the junction of a far greater number of the discontented. The hope was vain; the delay was ruinous. The chancellor, and the bishop of Aberdeen, having in vain attempted to conciliate the parties, James himself, accom∣panied by Angus, Argyle, and Lennox, and about five thou∣sand men, advanced through the snows of winter against the rebels. No sooner did the royal standard flash in their eyes than they fled. Margaret and Murray, advancing too late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">about 17 Jan.</NOTE> she could only join in the flight of Arran to Hamilton; while Murray, affecting to believe that the queen had deceived him by misrepresentation, proceeded to Linlithgow, and joined the party of Angus. The latter peer, in informing Magnus of this event, assures him that he shall still endeavour to be re∣conciled with the queen, and shall not challenge her conduct upon this occasion.<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. particularly Angus to Magnus. Lesley, 417, 418, is erroneous and unchronological: he confounds some circumstances with those of the contest in September this year.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
<P>The pacification of three years with England was concluded on the fifteenth of January; and was ratified by James on the twelfth day of February<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV, 115, 122.</NOTE>. Magnus, in an interesting letter to the queen on this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Feb.</NOTE> sent her the clause in which Henry had insisted on a provision for her, suitable to her high station, and that her conjunct feofments should be continued: he also informs her that if Angus should, as her husband, claim the feofment, it was evinced by the chancellor, the bishop of Aberdeen, and other lords of the council, that she had sufficient causes for a divorce, and that Angus should be obliged to consent; or should agree to submit the arrangement of the endowed lands wholly to the direction of James and the council; nay he had himself offered to submit any matter in dispute to her own brother. The embassador therefore advises her to concord and tranquillity: and informs her of some points concealed from her by flattery, such as that she embittered the mind of the king, who used often to shed tears, and shew anger to the lords, when he remained with her, whereas no such symptoms had appeared since she had resided in the north: he therefore hopes that, when she meets her son again, she will advise him to be gracious to the peers, and that she will not join any party in their disputes.</P>
<P>The period, and manner, in which Angus usurped the su∣preme power in the state, which he maintained for two years, have been most inaccurately detailed by our historians, ancient and modern. Nor do our original letters throw much light on this interesting event; while on his fall they dart a complete effulgence. In attempting to supply the want of materials, some previous considerations must be admitted. By the act
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>of July 1525<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See it in Keith's Hist. App. p. 10.</NOTE>, Angus and the archbishop of Glasgow were to remain with the king till the first of November; Arran and the bishop of Aberdeen till the beginning of February 1526; the chancellor and Argyle till May; Lennox and the bishop of Dumblane till August; when the circle recommenced. But Angus was also warden of the marches, an office attended with great authority: while on the other hand in the absence of the queen, who could not venture to approach the capital, a chief seat of the influence of Angus, the chancellor appears to have been perpetual president of the council of state; and Magnus ever mentions, and addresses, him as possessed of the highest power. During the affair of Linlithgow the earl of Arran ought to have been with the king in the capital; but as Angus had hastened to conclude the peace with England before his quarter expired, so he feared that Arran would defeat that measure during his period of power, and seems to have used such endeavours against that peer's assertion of his right, that he was forced to an ineffectual recourse to arms. In the field which ensued, Angus only appears to have marched by the desire of the chancellor and council, (and particularly the bishop of Aberdeen who was joined with Arran,) in order to defeat an attempt to overturn their decisions concerning the pacification; nor is any crime on this account imputed to him in his forfeiture, or by our historians. The council of state continued to exercise its full power, even against Angus him∣self. Magnus addressed the chancellor, and the council<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C. Cal. B. VII, 48, and the distinct letters to the lords, C. Cal. B. VII, 46.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 Feb.</NOTE> par∣ticularly the bishop of Aberdeen, Argyle and Lennox, in a warm remonstrance against Angus in his capacity of warden of the marches, who had received sufficient redress from the
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>English warden the earl of Westmoreland, but had granted none in return, being influenced to this injustice by Scot of Buccleugh and Mark Ker; he therefore desires the council to replace the good order, which prevailed before Angus was warden, as the poor on the marches were undone by his non∣attendance on the march days. The council answered that they had sharply reprimanded Angus;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Feb.</NOTE> and he had promised to comply with their injunctions for redress<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. VII, 30. The matter was "put sharply to his charge." The disorders of Lidsdale they impute to the minority of the earl of Bothwell: the prior of St. Andrew's was his guardian. This paper is signed "Gude, de mandato dominorum secreti concilii."</NOTE>. The particular answers of the chancellor, the bishop of Aberdeen, Argyle, and Lennox, are also extant<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">All originals, ib. 32, 33, 36.</NOTE>, all to the same purport: and Aberdeen expresses the firm inclination of the Scots to main∣tain the peace just ratified; and the desire of James that his mother should have a proper security from Angus, that she should not be molested in her person or lands. The em∣bassador soon after represented to Wolsey that the chancellor being the most powerful man in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 March</NOTE> and now the chief friend of the English interest, he should endeavour to accom∣plish his promises of procuring for him, from the pontiff, the dignities of cardinal and legate<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. II, 99.</NOTE>: but Wolsey's envy was little inclined to such equality of title.</P>
<P>Angus, who appears to have retained his high honour of husband to the queen, solely with a view to enjoy her revenues, finding that this usurpation was not to be continued, without forfeiting Henry's favour; a clause of the late peace, and the decision of the council also opposing his avaricious views, at length consented to the divorce, which was pronounced by the chancellor at St. Andrew's, upon the vain ground of a previous
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>promise of marriage by Angus to another lady<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 419.</NOTE>, while all the nation knew that solid grounds of separation arose from the adulteries of both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE> Hardly was the divorce pronounced before Margaret wedded Henry Stuart her paramour, afterwards to be created lord Methven<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. O. Lord William Dacre to Wolsey, 2 April, Cal. B. VII, 28.</NOTE>. Henry her brother, now perhaps revolving his own divorce from Catherine of Arragon, could not reprobate the example, but envied her change of situation, while he despised the meanness of her nuptials. Yet James, incensed at Stuart's presumption, the marriage having been private, and the royal consent not requested, sent lord Erskine with a body of men to the castle of Stirling, where his mother resided with her new husband; and Margaret surrendering him, he was imprisoned for a time<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Letter last quoted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At this epoch Angus was on the borders, whither he had marched to repress the disorders of the Armstrongs, then the most powerful and ferocious of the clans on the frontiers; but being protected by the Kers of Tividale, and by lord Maxwell, the warden of the western marches, the freebooters defied his power<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. The Scotish council had issued a proclamation of strict neutrality, towards the ships of France, and those of Spain and Flanders, subject to the emperor, then at war with their ancient ally: ib.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April</NOTE> Magnus, the English embassador, now left Scotland, after a residence of a year and a half; during which he had conducted the affairs entrusted to his care with eminent mode∣ration and ability.</P>
<P>The consideration of the steps which led Angus to the su∣preme power must now be resumed. He had sedulously cul∣tivated the favour of the young king, by presents, and by every attention and indulgence, which could secure his unexperienced affections; and the necessary residence of the monarch in the
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>capital, where, as in all the south of Scotland, the influence of Angus was unrivalled, further promoted his design. James regarded the marriage of his mother as an insult; and the variance was increased by her rage at the imprisonment of her husband. Amid these dispositions, Angus was secure of his ascendant over the king's mind; and the secret council formed the only obstacle to his ambition. By some precedents in France and Scotland the majority of a monarch was determined to commence at his fourteenth year, which James had attained in the preceding April; the object therefore was to summon a parliament, in which the majority of James should be declared, and the powers of the secret council in consequence annulled. Nor could either the parliament, or council, oppose with de∣cency a decree strictly constitutional, and agreeable to the wish of the nation, disgusted with the constant struggles, and with the discordant measures, of successive juntos.</P>
<P>Angus having prepared his plan, a parliament met at Edin∣burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 June</NOTE> on the thirteenth of June<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Carm. Tracts, p. 91.</NOTE>; and on the fifth day of its session, passed an ordinance<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See it in Crawford's Officers, p. 67, 68. In the letters of July 1528, (see that epoch,) and the act against Angus, July 1528, Crawf. 70, it is mentioned that he had retained his power for TWO YEARS; so that the commencement of his authority is ascertained beyond doubt.</NOTE>, bearing that as the king had now attained his complete majority of fourteen years, the whole regal prerogatives rested in his own hands: and all other authority, formerly used in his name, is declared to be ter∣minated. This decree, for the causes above recited, in fact threw the supreme power into the hands of Angus.</P>
<P>The precipitate marriage of Margaret ruined her influence; and Arran had abandoned her desperate cause to join the chan∣cellor, his relation, and Angus. This accession afforded a
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>great additional weight of power, and Angus carefully endea∣voured to preserve the attachment of Arran. The chancellor was now less necessary to the support of Angus, who began to manifest his ascendancy by heaping royal favours upon his own family, and by neglecting the chancellor, and some other members of the late council, who had expected to share the spoils. The impetuous nature of Sir George Douglas, brother to Angus, and by whose councils he was wholly guided, changed his influence over the king into a kind of constraint; and James sighed when he beheld his former flatterers transformed into his goalers<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This previous information, necessary to the clearness of the narrative, will be authenticated by subsequent letters.</NOTE>. The ancient power of the Douglases seemed to have revived, and after a slumber of near a century, again to threaten destruction to the Scotish monarchy.</P>
<P>On his first assumption of the authority, Angus had ex∣cited discontent by assigning the opulent abbacy of Holyrood-house to William, his brother, who already possessed by intru∣sion that of Coldingham<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 26.</NOTE>. The faction, and even the name of the leader, were further stained by the base assassination of Patrick Blackader, archdeacon of Dumblane, cousin of the prior of Coldingham, whose murder by Home of Wedderburn is above narrated. Patrick, though he had a safe conduct from Angus to come to Edinburgh, was slain by the Homes and Douglases, at the very gates of the capital<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. See the particulars in Hume's House of Douglas, I, 86, 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the disorders of the Armstrongs, and other marauders on the frontiers, continuing, Angus resolved to conduct the king in person to repress them. James, having advanced to Jedburgh, remained there three days without much effect: and, on the fourth day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 July</NOTE> was returning by Mel∣rose, when on a sudden, Walter Scot of Buccleugh appeared,
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>with a thousand armed followers. This powerful border chief∣tain was a retainer of Lennox, a circumstance which unites with succeeding events, to vindicate the opinion entertained by our historians, that Buccleugh intended to rescue the king from the inferior force of Angus. A messenger passed to Scot to enquire the reason of his appearance with such a company. The answer was, that he only designed to shew his bands to the king, as not unusual among the border chief∣tains, when that part of his dominions was graced with the royal presence. He was then commanded, in the name of the monarch, to dismiss his followers: but he replied that he was better informed of the king's intentions. Angus, per∣ceiving a conflict unavoidable, ordered his followers, (many of whom were gentlemen, who, by their armour and courage, supplied the inferiority of number,) to alight, as usual with the Scots, who rarely fought on horseback, excepting the trained cavalry, whose weapons were peculiar, and whose steeds were enured to the noise and tumult of battle. Lennox, Maxwell, and Sir George Douglas formed a guard around James, who retired to an eminence. Angus, Fleming, Home, Ker of Cessford, led on their bands against those of Buccleugh, now also alighted from their steeds. The conflict was brief: Buccleugh's borderers, after throwing their spears, fled in confusion, and about eighty of them were flain: their chief, after a strenuous contest, were forced to retire, but not without the flaughter of many of his enemies. The death of Ker of Ces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford, a man of worth, was regreted by both parties<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 419—421. Buch. XIV, 27.

<P>An us triumphed in his victory: and Lennox, being sus∣pected, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tired from the court. The chancellor meanwhile found his power diminished by Angus, who had even constrained

<P>Meanwhile Lennox was preparing for a decisive effort, to redeem his sovereign from the power of the Douglases; and being a man of the most amiable manners, and excellent cha∣racter, his people crowded to his standard. Many bands from Fife, and the north, instigated by the queen and the chancellor, also swelled his army. With a force of ten or twelve thousand<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 212, seems exact in his enumeration: "multo eoque lectissimo milite," says Lesley, 421: Buch. XIV, 28, also speaks of a great number.</NOTE> he advanced to Stirling, where he concerted matters with the chancellor, and other lords attached to his cause; and thence towards Linlithgow, where he found Arran, who had pro∣ceeded by the desire of Angus, with more than an equal number. It was hoped by the Douglases that, as Lennox was the sisten's son of Arran, their affinity might induce the former to listen to the intercession of his uncle, whose force was besides sufficient to shew that the enterprize was vain; and that thereby the envy of a contest with Lennox, a peer universally beloved, might have been averted. But this hope proved fallacious;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Sept.</NOTE> the rage of Lennox being increased by his kinsman, and friend, appearing as his open enemy, and in defence of a cause, in

On pretext of indisposition he delayed the march as much as possible; and the impatience of Angus advanced, leaving the king to the care of sir George his brother, whose violent spirit gave on this occasion an offence to the mind of his young sovereign never to be eradicated. For, on passing Corstor∣phin, the sound of the artillery was heard announcing the commencement of the conflict; and sir George having in vain intreated the king to use speed, he at length burst into this rash expression, "Should our enemies vanquish, rather than surrender your person, we should tear you in halves.<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 28, confirmed by Lesley, 422.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>Arran had seized the bridge across the river Avon, about a mile to the west of Linlithgow, so that Lennox was forced to have recourse to the ford opposite to the nunnery of Manuel. His men were harrassed by the difficult passage; and their adversaries possessing the adjacent heights, the disadvantage of the combat was great. But when the shout of Douglas! arose, upon the approach of Angus, the troops of Lennox yielded or fled. The king had in vain dispatched sir Andrew Wood, to request that the life of Lennox might be saved. On advancing into the field, Arran was found weeping over the body of his slaughtered kinsman, upon which he had spread his scarlet cloke, and exclaiming with anguish, "The wisest, the best, the bravest man in Scotland has fallen!" Besides Lennox, there
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>were slain the abbots of Melrose and Dunfermlin, the baron of Houston, and Stirling of Keir<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 215, Lest. 422, Buch. ib.

<P>Angus availed himself of this victory, which secured to him the chief power of Scotland, and marched to Stirling, to seize the queen, and the chancellor<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 422.</NOTE>.

<P>Henry congratulated Angus, and Arran, on their victory:<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Sept.</NOTE> promised them his advices concerning the proper education of his nephew; and exhorted them to crush their enemies, among whom he points out the chancellor as the chief, and as a man who sought their destruction, and endeavoured to plunge his country into the abysses of war<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O.

<PB N="282" REF="288"/>ample forseitures against all the enemies of the house of Douglas. James interceded for his mother, and even invited her to Edinburgh, where she arrived on the twentieth day of the month, the king with a numerous train advancing to meet her. The skillful chancellor made his peace with Angus and Arran, by affected submission, and by giving to the former two thousand marks, to the latter the abbey of Kilwinning. But the lands of the earl of Cassils, and lord Evandale, were assigned to the custody of Arran; while those of lord Lindsay, and all those chiefs of the east and north, who had been in the field with Lennox, were given to Angus; the two victo∣rious peers being to adjust their ransom at their pleasure. Those of Stirling of Keir were forseited, and bestowed on sir George Douglas. Argyle and Crawford did not appear in this parliament, being probably suspected of favouring the cause of Lennox. After having sitten for fourteen days, the national council was "continued with all the summonses of the three estates," or in other words, was prorogued, till the eighth day of January<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">All these particulars are derived from the letter last quoted, Cal.

<P>Of the meeting of parliament in January no memorial re∣mains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1527</NOTE> Margaret continued at Edinburgh with her son; but the universal awe of the house of Douglas was now too great, the disasters which its enmity inferred too recent, for any new scheme to be undertaken for the deliverance of James, which seemed hopeless. Among the king's favourites Patrick Sin∣clair<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 26 March, Cal. B.

The queen having insisted that lady Evandale, her husband's mother, should be received at court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE> James rejected her request, upon which she left Edinburgh in disgust<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. The archbishop Beton had retired from the court.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A parliament met in May<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Carmichael's Tracts, p. 91, where it is remarkable that Cassils is mentioned as present, though his lands were assigned to Arran in the preceding November, (Letter of Christopher Dacre:) and according to Lesley, he was slain by the sheriff of Air, soon after the death of Lennox in 1526. Buchanan, who was tutor to his son, (Lise, p. 2,) narrates XIV, 30, the death of Cassils, assas∣sinated by Hugh Campbell sheriff of Air, at some length, and he fixes it at the same epoch. It may be thought that he of 1527 was the heir, but he was "adhuc impubes," Buch. XIV, 30; and the name does not appear again in the rolls of parliament, till 1535, Carm. 92. As Christopher Dacre is silent con∣cerning the death of Cassils, and the records mention him in May 1527, it may be suspected that Lesley and Buchanan err in the year; and that he was not slain till towards the end of 1527. Douglas, Peer. 136, seems rightly to say that he was murdered at Prestick, 22 Dec. 1527.
<P>It is remarkable that, in Dec. 1544, a remission was issued in parliament to William earl of Glencairn, Gilbert earl of Cassils, and Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, sheriff of Air, for all treasons committed by them during the reign of James V. Epist. R. S. II, 320. It may seem that Campbell succeeded sir James Hamilton as sheriff of Air in 1540, and is so styled by historians at 1526, only by an unchronological, though common, mode of language.</P></NOTE>; but its transactions are unre∣corded. The disorders on the frontiers still continuing, so as
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>to threaten an interruption of the peace with England, which Angus sedulously maintained, it was esteemed indispensable to suppress them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> Preparations were accordingly made; and the bands of Angus and Arran had marched to Edinburgh to at∣tend the king, when an unexpected incident had almost turned their swords upon each other. A groom of the late earl of Lennox, of heroic attachment to his master, who had fallen by the cruel hand of sir James Hamilton after he had yielded, came to Edinburgh; where, meeting a fellow servant, he enquired if he had seen the bastard of Arran? being answered in the affirmative, he replied, "Ungrateful wretch! couldst thou behold the murderer of our master without stabbing him to the heart? Begone; disgrace me not by thy base company." He then proceeded to the palace of Holyroodhouse, in the open area before which not less than two thousand attendants of the houses of Douglas and Hamilton were, at that hour, mustered for the expedition. Piercing through the crowd, he
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>saw sir James Hamilton, alone and unarmed, leave his people, and enter the palace by a dark staircase near the gate: he in∣stantly followed, and attacking the object of his revenge, he left him extended with six severe wounds, none of which however proved mortal, and then sprung over among the po∣pulace. An alarm arising, the Douglases and Hamiltons began to suspect each other, and a private revenge might have served the nation, had not the more prudent ordered the gates of the area to be shut, and the crowd to arrange themselves along the walls. Discovered by his bloody dagger, the generous assassin was seized, and conducted to goal; where, on menaces of the torture, he confessed that his sole motive was to avenge his master's fall, his sole regret that he had not succeeded. He was put to death with cruel torments, none of which had any power over his firm mind; and when his right hand was cut off, he said, with a sarcastic smile, that it deserved its fate for fulfilling so ill so bold an intent<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 31. Lesl. 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king, proceeding to Jedburgh, constrained the bor∣derers, particularly the Armstrongs, a clan rendered opulent by their frequent spoils in England, to give pledges for their peaceable behaviour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 June.</NOTE> and then dismissed them with strict in∣junctions, and the severest menaces in case of future disobedi∣ence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 426.</NOTE>. Angus had apparently assumed the office of chancellor at the commencement of the parliament of May, having at length withdrawn the seals from Beton, after in vain attempt∣ing to unite that rich and powerful primate to his party; and it is certain that in August the earl appears in that high station<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Crawf. Off. 68, from a charter in the Scotish archives, dated 8 Aug. 1527.</NOTE>. This additional power only increased the constraint of James; who in vain repeatedly applied to his uncle to assist in his de∣liverance;
<PB N="386" REF="292"/>while Henry was rather disposed to prolong the power of the Douglases, who continued to manifest the warmest devotion to his interest.</P>
<P>Some events worthy of commemoration happened in the northern provinces. The houses of Lesley and Forbes being at enmity, the counties of Mar, Gareoch, and Aberdeen, were exposed to constant ravages and reprizals; but by the interference of Angus the differences were composed, and a lasting friendship established. While the lowlands frequently afforded scenes of rapine and slaughter, the highlands were lost in all the outrage which distinguishes a savage state of so∣ciety. Lachlan Mackintosh, chief of the noted clan Chattan, being a man of prudence, and attached to good order, restricted his people from the excesses usual to the other clans. James Malcomson his relation, desirous to terminate this restraint; basely assassinated the worthy leader, and took refuge in an isle of the lake of Rothemurky: but he, and his associates, were pursued by the clan, and put to an ignominious death. The son of the late chief being very young, he was delivered to the care of the earl of Murray for his education: and Hector Mackintosh, the bastard brother of Lachlan, was appointed leader of the clan till his nephew should be of age. The new chieftain in vain endeavoured to recover from Murray his young charge, either to lend more firmness to his power, or by his death to ensure its duration. Irritated by the earl's opposition he ravaged his lands, captured the town of Dyke, and castle of Tarnaway; conflagration, slaughter, rapine, marking his ferocious progress. The castle of Pettie, belong∣ing to Ogilvy of Durness, was also taken; and twenty four of that name slain, because Murray had committed the young chief to the care of the Ogilvies, his relations on the mother's side. Emboldened by success Hector proceeded to other out∣rages,
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>when Murray procured from the king a commission of lieutenant general for the suppression of these disorders. The earl, raising an army, rushed upon the Mackintoshes with such impetuosity, that no opportunity of resistance was given: about two hundred of the perpetrators were seized and hanged: but no torture, nor reward, could induce any of them to dis∣cover the concealment of their chief, a fidelity which, if ex∣erted in the cause of virtue, would have merited the highest applause. Yet William brother of Hector, and a principal actor in those sanguinary scenes, suffered the fate of a rebel; his head was exposed at Dyke, his quarters at Elgin, Fores, Inverness, Aldern. Hector in despair fled, by the assistance of Alexander dean of Moray, and by earnest supplications and professions, at the feet of James, obtained the royal mercy: but he was soon after slain in St. Andrew's by a priest named James Spence, who was degraded and executed for the assas∣sination<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 423—426. John Smyth, monk of Kinloss, MS. Harl. 2363 dates these events 1534; but his dates are confused.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Angus continued sedulously to cultivate the protection of Henry, and the friendship of Wolsey. His correspondence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> as chancellor of Scotland<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. to Wolsey, 2 Nov. 1527, Cal. B. VII, 101; and 29 Dec. 1527, ib. 93. Albany's return was still dreaded.</NOTE>, breathes a firm and uniform desire to maintain the pacification with England; but hesitates not to insinuate hopes of pecuniary rewards. Sir William Lisle, and his sons, being declared traitors by Henry, had fled into Scotland; and Angus endeavoured in vain to discover and de∣liver them up. Wolsey, on his side, encouraged his attachment to England by a liberality of praise, and political advice<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The receipt of which Angus acknowledges in his letter last quoted.</NOTE>,
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>which Angus would willingly have exchanged for a purse of angels.</P>
<P>By a proper application of some portions of his opulence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec.</NOTE> and by the mediation of Archibald Douglas provost of Edin∣burgh, uncle of Angus, the artful primate of St. Andrew's now accomplished an apparent reconciliation with that potent earl<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 10 Jan. 1528, B. II, 140.</NOTE>. Sir George Douglas warmly opposed this measure, which was soon to prove fatal to his house. The queen had, some months before, returned to the court of her son, and resumed her wonted influence over him; so that Magnus who, though in England, had from confidential friends speedy intel∣ligence of the affairs of Scotland, hesitates not to affirm, in a letter to Wolsey<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, that the effects would soon be perceived; and would turn to the destruction of Angus, whom, in the emphatic language of that age, he thus characterizes, "he is gentill and hardy; but he wanteth witte in conveyaunce of grete causes." Yet he allows to Angus the praise of com∣monly listening to the prudence of others. The festival of Christmas presented at the royal board the unexpected presence of the queen, the archbishop of St. Andrew's, and Angus; nor had Scotland cause to sigh at the infatuation of the house of Douglas<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lindsay's delineation of its tyranny, p. 206, is drawn in his wonted lively colours.

<P>Perhaps the friendship of Arran was sacrificed by all parties upon this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1528</NOTE> for little further mention of him occurs in history. However this be, the archbishop of St. An∣drew's
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>was no sooner reinstalled in some degree of his for∣mer power, than he exerted it in the most odious manner. The doctrines of Luther were so well adapted to the previous preparation of the minds of men, that, in the space of ten years, the converts were numerous in all regions. Among these Patrick Hamilton, son of Hamilton of Kinkavil, formerly captain of Blackness, having travelled in Germany imported the reformed doctrines into Scotland, where he was to receive the eternal fame of being the protomartyr of the freedom of the human mind. On the pretext of a conference he was in∣veigled to St. Andrew's; and, after a brief trial, was delivered to the secular arm, and to the flames<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Keith, Hist. p. 8: the sentence dated the last day of Feb. 1527-8, ib.

These flames were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Feb.</NOTE> in the course of one generation, to enlighten all Scotland; and to consume, with avenging fury, the catholic superstition, the papal power, and even the prelacy itself.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the queen had in vain endeavoured to shake the authority of Angus. Lord Maxwell, who was firmly attached to her, had made an incursion into England, and burnt the town of Netherby, apparently with a view to exasperate the English to an infraction of the peace; but Angus constrained Maxwell to compound for the damages with lord William Dacre the warden<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O.

Lesley informs us that the queen, her husband Henry Stuart, and his brother James, having taken refuge in the castle of Edinburgh, to secure themselves from Angus, probably attempting some extortion of the endowed lands, the king himself advanced to besiege the fortress; upon

<P>The plot of the king's liberation from the odious power of the Douglases was now formed, but proceeded with the secret force of a subterraneous river, till it burst forth with the fury of a cataract.

Angus had gone to Lothian, on necessary affairs, leaving with the king Sir Archi∣bald his uncle, Sir George his brother, and James Douglas of Parkhead captain of the royal guard. The uncle soon after
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>travelled to Dundee, to visit his mistress; the brother to St. Andrew's, to conclude an advantageous lease with the primate: but the guard of one hundred, commanded by Parkhead, was esteemed a sufficient check on the motions of the monarch.</P>
<P>James seizing the opportunity ordered preparations for a solemn hunting on the ensuing day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> at seven in the morning; and pretended to retire early to rest, an example followed by the captain of the guard, after placing the usual watch. The king, disguised as a groom, and attended by two faithful ser∣vants, passed to the stables; and, mounting fleet horses, they reached Stirling by dawn of day: where having commanded the gates to be shut, and no entrance allowed except by the royal order, he retired to the castle, and enjoyed some repose after his fatigue. He afterwards proceeded to a council, con∣sisting of Arran, Argyle, Murray, Eglinton, and the lords Montgomery, Evandale, Sinclair, Maxwell<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Queen's credence, just quoted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Sir George Douglas having returned to Falk∣land, at eleven o'clock in the preceding evening, was next morning awakened with the dreadful tidings of the monarch's escape.

<HEAD>BOOK XIV. BEING THE FIRST PART OF THE ACTUAL REIGN OF JAMES V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Character of James V—forfeiture of Angus—negotiations—siege of Tantallon—peace with England—Armstrongs—borderers punished—death of Arran—commercial treaty with Flanders—college of justice—hostilities with England—truce—northern progress of James—protestants burnt—reformation in England —Howard's embassy—parliament—embassy from the emperor.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>JAMES V was now aged sixteen years and about three months.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> Of this monarch all our early historians pre∣sent one uniform character; and their general voice proclaims his excellence. His education, as usual with princes who as∣cend the throne in infancy, had been neglected, or erroneous; corrupted by flattery; rendered deficient in its tasks from the preceptor's fear of displeasing. Yet his mind was great, his affections warm, his discernment acute. His vices were few, and never interrupted the happiness of his people. His pro∣pensity to vague amour was palliated by his general affability; his sternness to the nobles by his favour to the common people, which was so eminent that he received from his affectionate
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>subjects the glorious appellation of King of the Poor<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 460.</NOTE> To the voice of poverty, to the prayer of distress, the gates of his palace stood ever open: with one hand he raised the indi∣gent, while with the other he crushed the proud oppressor. In the knowledge of the laws and customs of his kingdom he was so completely versed, that his decisions were as exact as they were expeditions; and from horseback he often pro∣nounced decrees worthy of the sagest seat of justice. Of indubitable valour, of remarkable strength of constitution, he exposed his life, and health, without hesitation, at any season when it became necessary to curb the marauding borderers, or highlanders, rendered lawless during the disorders of a long minority. The dangers of the wilderness, the gloom of night, the tempests of winter, could not prevent his patient exertions to protect the helpless, to punish the guilty, to enforce the ob∣servance of the laws. A stranger to pride, he despised it in others; and his speech was ever sprinkled with humanity<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A forcible expression of Lesley, "sermo humanitate, tanquam sale, as∣persus." For the general character, compare also Buch. XIV, 62, and Lind∣say, 276.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The faults of his government, though not minute, are more to be ascribed to the times, than to the character of the mo∣narch. His avarice naturally arose from the penury of his education, the dissipation of his finances, and even of the fur∣niture of his palaces, by the unprincipled duke of Albany. But his amassed treasure was employed in the construction of magnificent works of architecture, and of a navy; and in other plans of general utility and glory. His political designs were long studied; yet as he died in his thirtieth year he could not have acquired the experience of age: and the period of his reign presented combinations too intricate for the most skilful
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>prudence to foresee, or define. The progress of the protestant religion was dubious; and dangerous it is for a prince to em∣brace a new system before it be approved by a great majority of his subjects. Untaught by the glorious concord between his father and the nobles, James entertained a fixed enmity against the aristocracy, which had effected great usurpations during his minority; and his attachment to the eminent clergy, who alone could balance their power, was unavoidable.</P>
<P>Of the person, and domestic life, of James V the features are well known. His frame was of the middle size, and ro∣bust, capable of every exertion of agility, or fatigue. In ele∣gance of form, and countenance, he equalled any prince of his time. His oval face, blue eyes of piercing splendor, aqui∣line nose, yellow hair, and small beard forked in the fashion of that period, impressed the beholders with ideas of sweet∣ness joined with majesty. In dress he was rather elegant than magnificent: yet his palaces were replete with decoration. The repast of a peasant he would share; and, even from a sumptuous board, the royal meal was plain, and frugal; nor did he entrust his dignity to the intemperance of wine. Emi∣nently patient he was of labour, of hunger and thirst, of heat and cold. His attachment to the arts was decided: he reared palaces of good architecture; and composed some fugitive pieces of poetry, though it be doubtful if any have reached our times<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Sir D. Lindsay, a contemporary, avouches the royal poetry, in his "Answer to the king's flyting." Drummond, 228, says <HI>many</HI> of his verses were extant in his time. It is to be regretted that our monarchs did not, like those of Spain and Portugal, compose history. See the Bibliotheca Hispanica of Antonio.</NOTE>. He replenished his country with artillery, and military weapons; and the beauty of his gold coins bespeaks his attention even to the minutest improvements, to be gained by the employment of foreign artists.

<PB N="295" REF="301"/>ruined by Albany, began to resume some importance: and the subsequent voyage of James to the Orkneys and Hebudes, accompanied by men of skill, in order to examine the dangers and advantages of the circumjacent seas, will ever deserve the applause of the philosopher, as an enterprize equally rare and meritorious.</P>
<P>When James had appeared at the council-board at Stirling, when the Douglases had obeyed his mandate not to approach the court, his regal authority may be regarded as complete, and free from all constraint. Yet the power and influence of Angus had been so extensive, that it was necessary to use pre∣cautions, in order to prevent the efforts of his despair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 July</NOTE> Ac∣cordingly James immediately proceeded to Edinburgh, accom∣panied by the archbishop of Glasgow, the bishops of Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Galloway, Brechin, the earls of Argyle, Arran, Eglinton, Rothes, Bothwell, the lords Maxwell, Evandale, Seton, Forbes, Home, Yester, and their servants to the number of three hundred spears.<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O.

The archbishop of Glasgow, Gawin Dunbar formerly preceptor to James, was appointed chancellor of the kingdom; Beton, from whom Angus had wrested the seals, being now probably advanced in years, and disgusted with the fatigues of that high office. Lord Maxwell

No∣thing but extreme youth can palliate such unhappy favouritism; but perhaps the valour alone of Sir James recommended him to the king, as a safeguard at this crisis. For, during this short residence at Edinburgh, the lords in their turns watched the royal palace by night, with their followers in the most de∣fensible array; nor did the monarch himself, no stranger to the power and enterprize of Angus, disdain to head the guard, for the space of one night, dressed in complete armour.

<P>The intention of James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> to attaint the Douglases in the ap∣proaching parliament, being known, Angus retired to Tantal∣lon, a castle in East Lothian of great strength; and sent to Sir Roger Lassels, to inquire if he could be received at Nor∣ham, in case of necessity<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">C.

<P>The national council having assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sept.</NOTE> James was not willing to entrust the forfeiture of Angus to their general deliberation, knowing that the earl had many friends; but six clergymen, and five peers, were selected, namely the archbishop of Glasgow, the bishops of Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Galloway, Dumblane, the prior of St. Andrew's; the earls Argyle, Ar∣ran, Eglinton, Murray, and lord Maxwell<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C.

<P>The fallen earl had employed Andrew Cairns, provincial minister of the friars minors in Scotland, to intercede with the king.

<P>James sent a detachment into Douglasdale, to besiege the castle of Douglas; but while he was himself proceeding with the main body, it was represented by the peers that the expe∣dition should be deferred till the corn were reaped, lest the country might receive injury.

<P>Having again collected some forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">about 2 Oct.</NOTE> James proceeded to Coldingham, and Angus having retired, the place was assigned to the custody of lord Home, and his brother the abbot of Jedburgh.

<P>The Scotish monarch, irritated by resistance and misadven∣ture, raised an army of twelve thousand men, provided with artillery from Dunbar, and other places, and proceeded against Tantallon<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O.

Angus, whose intelligence was wonderful, suddenly advanced with one hundred and sixty cavalry, assailed the detachment by the light of the moon, and put it to a total route. Among the slain was David Falconer, captain of the king's guard of infantry, and esteemed the best naval officer in Scotland. The master of the artillery was among the cap∣tives. Angus then convoyed the artillery on its destined road; and delivering the master, ordered him to assure the king of his loyal services, and that his enmity was only directed against evil counsellors, who had exposed their prince to such dishonour on the present occasion<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. James, burning with indignation, declared with an oath that, while he lived, the Douglases should find no refuge in Scotland; and he observed the adju∣ration<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV. 37.</NOTE>. His rage was yet further increased by the fate of the Martin, a valuable mercantile vessel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Nov.</NOTE> which being stranded by a tempest at Innerwick on the eastern coast of Lothian, was seized by the followers of Angus; they rifled part of the cargo, and abandoned the rest to the peasants, who ignorant of its value used the cinnamon as a material of domestic fire, and perfumed their huts with oriental luxury<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 36.</NOTE> The office of leading some troops to Coldingham, in order to expell the Douglases, being
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>refused by Bothwell, was conferred on Argyle<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 37. Yet Angus seems rather to have left Scotland by Henry's desire, the prolongation of the peace being resolved. See Hume's house of Douglas, II, 104.</NOTE>, who succeeded; and that potent family were forced into England, where Angus and his brother Sir George were to reside during the remainder of this reign, the earl being admitted to the English privy council, and continuing to be highly favoured by Henry: nor did they revisit Scotland till the second year of Mary's minority, after an exile of fifteen years: but no longer was a Douglas to be dangerous to the Scotish throne.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a negotiation was conducted for the renewal of the peace with England, which was to expire in the ap∣proaching January. Dr. Magnus, and Sir Thomas Tempest, were the acting commissioners, on the part of Henry; their instructions chiefly tended to accomplish, by every possible en∣deavour, the restitution of Angus to his titles and estates; the more especially as it was reported that James was treating with the emperor Charles V, now the enemy of England and of France, and the potent earl might support the English influ∣ence<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O. Instructions, Cal. B. VIII, 25, and B. V, 41.</NOTE>. But Magnus advised Wolsey not to irritate James by insisting vehemently on the cause of Angus, who, during the three years that he had been warden of the borders, had never administered justice<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 14 Nov. B. II, 106.</NOTE>; yet the cardinal, though his fall was fast approaching, continued his usual obstinacy, and gave James infinite disgust. The commissioners having advanced to Berwick, where the negotiations were to be adjusted, Dr. Magnus remained there for more than two months; and was honoured by the correspondence of James, and the queen-mother whose good offices were solicited in favour of Angus<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">C. Magnus to Margaret, Berwick, 18 Nov. B. VII, 106.</NOTE>.
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>But she answered, with her usual spirit, that such solicitations shewed little regard either to her, or her son; and that if the English king had acted in a more fraternal manner to her, she might now have been both able and willing to serve him<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. B. VII, 107.</NOTE>. The reply of James testisies his high obligations to Henry, for his preservation from manifold perils during his minority; and offers in gratitude a pacification of five years, instead of three, as formerly proposed, and all possible redress for any injuries sustained by the English on the marches; but positively rejects the mediation for Angus, to whom he can only afford a remit∣tance of the sentence of death; at the same time assuring Magnus that he prefers the alliance with England to that with the emperor<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. James to Magnus, 24 Nov. B. VII, 104.</NOTE>. The chancellor, and council of Scotland, the bishops of Dunkeld and Aberdeen, and Adam Ottirburn the king's advocate, also rejected, by their letters, the applications of Magnus in favour of Angus<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Cal. B. VII, 110, 120, 115, 117, 116, in the order of names in the text.</NOTE>, whose partisans sedulously re∣ported that England would not consent to peace, except the earl were restored to his honours and estates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 Nov.</NOTE> Magnus in∣formed Wolsey of the pernicious tendency of this report, James being so much affected at this violation of his dignity, by his uncle's preferring Angus to him, that he burst into tears of rage in full council, while the members joined in his resent∣ment. The embassador adds that James had shewn a readiness to pardon Angus, upon certain promises; which the earl having revoked, the king also recoiled; and that, though An∣gus was a good and honourable man, yet he was misled by his brother Sir George, as Archibald Douglas the uncle was by his opulent wife, and to those violent conductors were the misfortunes of the family to be solely imputed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 30 Nov. B. II, 105.</NOTE>. In order to
<PB N="304" REF="310"/>conciliate James, the marriage with Henry's daughter, Mary, was again hinted by Magnus to Ottirburn; and it was re∣quested that the proposed embassy for a bride might be de∣layed<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">C. Magnus to Orirburn, 5 Dec. B. VII, 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Scotish cabinet at length issued a commission to Scot of Balwery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Dec.</NOTE> Adam Ottirburn, and Ker of Ferniherst, to renew the pacification<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV, 275.</NOTE>: and they proceeded to Berwick to meet Magnus and Tempest. By previous articles the Scotish com∣missioners engaged that compensation should be made for the inroads of the people of Lidsdale; they give an elusory promise to assist Henry in procuring the restitution of Angus, if agree∣able to their own monarch; and a positive consent that Angus his brother and uncle may be received in England, without breach of the article concerning the reception of rebels, pro∣vided that they surrender to James the castle of Tantallon, and their other fortresses<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV, 276.</NOTE>. A peace of five years was concluded two days after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Dec.</NOTE> which was, as soon as the formalities would admit, duly ratified by both monarchs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 278, 286.</NOTE>. The castle of Tan∣tallon, and other fortresses of the Douglases, were in conse∣quence rendered into the hands of the Scotish king.</P>
<P>Yet Magnus remained at Berwick, to discover with more accuracy the intentions of James; for though William Hamil∣ton the envoy to France returned at this time with a rejection of all the Scotish proposals, Francis being now entirely devoted to Henry; yet the emperor Charles V employed the media∣tion of Margaret his aunt, governess of the Netherlands, of the lord of Campvere, and of Moffat the Scotish conservator of trade at Middleburg, in order to procure the marriage of James with his sister the queen of Hungary, Mary the widow

James entrusted him with instructions to shew to Henry, in which he largely vindicated his conduct to the family of Douglas<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. VIII, 1. Among other topics, this curious paper bears that Angus had a design to murder James, as some nobles could prove; that, last Easter, James had, by the advice of aged peers, called Angus before a council of five or six, repeated the public murmurs, and desired a reform, but the only fruit was that the earl imagined the death of the advisers; and that James, by the faith of a prince, intended no more against Angus and his friends, than to have withdrawn their offices, had they not passed into open rebellion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A parliament was held at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1529 22 Jan.</NOTE> of which some statutes have been preserved; and particularly one declaring the wilful conflagration of houses, or corn, to be treason; the penalty being rendered thus high, in order to prevent the commission of a crime become very frequent<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts.</NOTE>. The marauders on the frontiers increased their disorders; the Armstrongs, had in the course of a few years, destroyed not less than fifty two parish churches in Scotland, if Magnus be believed; and they openly boasted that they would neither be subject to James, nor Henry, but would continue their excesses<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. Magnus to Wolsey, 14 Feb. B. II, 67.</NOTE>. The Scotish king loudly blamed Angus, and his adherents, for encouraging these crimes, and resolved speedily to terminate them with an iron hand, beginning now to have recourse to aged and prudent counsellors, and not hesitating to ascribe the fall of his ally,

<P>So relaxed had the reins of government become by a long minority, that the distant regions seemed to have lost all law. The earl of Caithness, and lord Sinclair, having resolved to seize the Orkneys, led an army against those islands. But they were met by James Sinclair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18 May</NOTE> governor for the king, the Orkneys having been for more than half a century a royal ap∣penage; and the Orcadians displayed such loyalty and courage that they completely defeated their invaders, their enthusiasm being so much kindled on this occasion that, in their pious eyes, their military patron St. Magnus became a visible champion, who opened to them the road to victory. The slaughter was great on both sides; Caithness and five hundred of his follow∣ers were slain; Sinclair and the rest remained captives<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 430.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king summoned a council of the nobles to Edinburgh, where it was determined to proceed with salutary rigour against the borderers who continued to defy the laws. To institute an example of terror to their chieftains, William Cockburn of Henderland, and Adam Scot of Tushilaw, were tried, con∣demned, and executed<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

<PB N="307" REF="313"/>of seventeen, had projected a deep political plan to depress his nobles. Their outrages during his minority, while the peers of England had begun to feel and respect the tranquillity of the laws, had justly excited his lively resentment; and his love of his people prompted him to crush those proud oppressors, who drew their chief revenues from the distress of the industrious, and maintained bands of lawless followers at the public ex∣pence.</P>
<P>So uncertain is sometimes the chronology of Scotish history, even at this period, and so negligent have all our writers been in this important province, that it is dubious if some events, ascribed to this year, did not occur in the course of the next. Of this kind is the imprisonment of Bothwell; which was fol∣lowed by that of other border chiefs, the earl of Home, lord Maxwell, Scot of Buccleugh, Ker of Ferniherst, Polwarth, Johnston, Mark Ker<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 431. Buchanan dates these events, and the execution of the Arm∣strongs, in 1530, for after narrating them he proceeds, "Proximo anno qui suit 1531:" the date 1529 should be put at the words "Arce dedita," after the surrender of Tantallon, for it was in 1529 that Sir Robert Barton was made treasurer, Crawf.

<P>Having thus secured their protectors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> James collected some troops, and proceeded to Eusdale, against the marauders them∣selves. Forty eight of the most criminal were seized, and hanged; one who had set fire to a house, and therein con∣sumed a woman and her children, was, with just retaliation, committed to the flames. But the fate of the Armstrongs, long notorious for the atrocity of their ravages, chiefly excited the public attention, and applause. By the assistance of George his brother, who was pardoned on condition of betray∣ing the others, John Armstrong the chief of the name, whose
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>robberies had elevated him to opulence and power, was cap∣tured, and suffered the fate of a felon<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 432. Buch. XIV, 39. Lindsay, 226.</NOTE>. Having thus at length accomplished the subordination of the frontiers, James returned to Edinburgh, and released the imprisoned chiefs, now taught to acknowledge the regal sword as well as the sceptre. But Bothwell, who exceeded in faults and in power, remained in durance.</P>
<P>Archibald Douglas, uncle of Angus, clandestinely return∣ing to Scotland, suddenly threw himself at the king's feet, while he was on a journey; but James having made a vow to pardon none of the family, he with reluctance exiled the old man to France<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lesl. ib.

<P>James had dispatched an embassador to Francis, concerning his marriage with the queen of Hungary sister of Charles V; and at the same time sent letters to Albany, representing that, as they were the sole survivors of their family, this event might interest his uncle's exertions, as well as his own, and desiring his intercession with the French king for its accom∣plishment. But Albany ungenerously remitted a copy of the letters to Wolsey, with a credence by James Lamb, who was authorized to declare his master's devotion to Henry and Wol∣sey, and his intentions of opposing any connubial alliance with Charles, the enemy of England and France<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C.

This disingenu∣ous flattery was vain, for, in October this year, the cardinal was hurled from the summit of power; and was, a year after, to leave in his death a striking lesson to mankind on the vicissi∣tude of fortune.

The intended bride was the duchess of Urbino, so styled, but apparently the widow of the usurper Lorenzo of Medici, and in consequence a relation of the ad∣viser.

<P>The enmity of James to his nobles increased with his wisdom and years. Ignorant, and incapable, they were only distin∣guished
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>as the disturbers of the public tranquillity, and as the foes of industry. Angus he had banished, Crawford he had stripped of a great part of his inheritance: Argyle was now in prison; Murray and Maxwell were disregarded; and Sir James Hamilton treated with deserved contempt<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Communications Northumberland and Bothwell, 21 Dec. 1531, B. V, 216.</NOTE>. The clergy on the other hand, being friends of order and peace, and distin∣guished by talents and learning, were highly honoured by the king. The archbishop of Glasgow the chancellor, James Be∣ton archbishop of St. Andrew's, and his nephew David Beton abbot of Arbroth and lord privy seal, afterwards cardinal and chancellor, were the most eminent of the clergy, and chosen counsellors of James. As he could not foresee the progress of the protestant faith, and the consequent enmity to be enter∣tained against his ministers, the choice was laudable; if indeed there was a choice, when the church afforded the only men in his kingdom capable of political discussion and decision.</P>
<P>Yet Bothwell, irritated by his own former imprisonment, and by the contempt which James manifested of the aristocracy, secretly passed into the north of England, where he held a con∣ference with Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Dec.</NOTE> treasonable against his sove∣reign. He represented his own grievances, that James, for∣getting the services of his father and grandfather, had long held him in nonage, and given some of his lands to the Kers of Tividale, forbidding the earl to recover them by law, on pretext of his misrule; that he had been imprisoned for half a year, and would have suffered death, had not his friends en∣tered into a cognizance of twenty thousand pounds, to restore him to durance when required. He expressed his hopes that Henry would assist the peers against James, who was in league with his enemies the emperor, the Danish king, and O'donnel
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>an Irish chieftain. He mentioned the severity shewn to An∣gus, Crawford, Argyle, and others: and if Henry will wage war against Scotland, and raise the nobles from their depression, he offers his allegiance, and services, with one thousand gen∣tlemen, and one thousand commons; so that, with the addi∣tional aid of Angus, the English monarch might soon be in possession of the capital city of Scotland<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>Two important events distinguish this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1532 17 May</NOTE> the institution of the college of justice, and a war or rather an interruption of the peace with England. A parliament assembled, in which the various articles of the institution of a new court of law were considered and passed<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 113. MS. Harl. 2363, f. 18, written by a contemporary, John Smyth monk of Kinloss. The inaccurate edition of our statutes by Murray of Glendook places this institution in 1537: yet the king's ratification, p. 121, bears, in the nineteenth year of his reign, that is 1532!</NOTE>. The plan, which was in imitation of the parliament of Paris, had been formerly pro∣jected by the regent Albany. Before this institution civil causes were adjudged by standing committees, consisting of members of each of the three parliamentary orders, who made an annual circuit into each of the quarters of the kingdom. The plan was attended with many inconveniencies; the ex∣pence to which the members were exposed rendered them re∣luctant in performing this duty, and precipitant in its accom∣plishment. And the deputies of the commons being annually changed, if a suit were prolonged, the change of judges, who
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>were again to be instructed in the whole procedure, rendered the embarrassment and protraction extreme; not to mention that perhaps none of the members, except the clergy, were conversant in the laws. The new institution has been attacked with rancour by Buchanan, whose protestant enmity to James, (because that monarch did not rashly exchange his faith for a new doctrine, not yet adopted by the majority of his people,) delights to misrepresent the motives, and actions, of a prince, whom, in the conclusion of his reign, he is constrained highly to applaud. That famous historian says, "there being hardly any laws in Scotland, except the acts of parliament, which are mostly of the temporary class; and those judges preventing, as far as their power will permit, the enaction of new statutes; the properties of all the citizens are in fact committed to the arbitrement of fifteen men, whose power is perpetual, and whose controul is tyrannical, since their wills form their only laws<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 43.</NOTE>." This satire might have some justice when Buchanan wrote; but the numerous acts of parliament, the codes of de∣cisions, the power of appeal since the union of the kingdoms, the very attention of the judges to their own character, while seated in the tribunal before a sagacious public in an en∣lightened age, all conspire to overturn its present force. That the English mode of deciding even civil causes by jury is far more favourable to freedom, than this plan of a standing jury, appointed and paid by the king, is most evident; and truth will reluctantly confess that few and rare are those judges, or even lawyers, in Scotland, who have twined the wreath of eloquence around the altar of freedom. Yet, on the other hand, the institution of the court of session could flow from no arbitrary principle, as it was confessedly founded in imitation
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>of the parliament of Paris; and it is well known that the latter court alone nourished the feeble flame of liberty, while the night of despotism had enveloped France.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to enter into the trivial detail of the various articles relating to this important institution. Suffice it to ob∣serve that its power of decision extended to all causes, except those of riot or oppression, which passed to the privy council, while other criminal suits remained in the jurisdiction of the court of the High Justiciary; and that the original number of its members were fifteen, half clergy, half laity, and a presi∣dent; the first members being the abbot of Cambuskenneth president, Richard Bothwell, John Dingwall, Henry White, Robert Shanwell, William Gibson, Thomas Hay, Arthur Boyce<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">A kinsman of Hector Boyce, the historian, as appears from his Lives of the Bishops of Aberdeen; and the orthography of the name is evinced from this act.

<P>The brief interruption of the peace with England, by mu∣tual inroads, demands the explanation of a cursory glance on the affairs of Europe. An alliance between Francis and Henry against the emperor had subsisted for six years; half of the space in war; the latter half in a peace, which was to continue for two years longer, though Francis now joined the league of Smalcald. Henry, eager in prosecuting his divorce from Catherine of Arragon, was about to liberate his kingdom
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>from the ignominious chains of Rome. The treaty between him and Francis was renewed, and a conference appointed, which took place in October this year: and was followed, in December, by a fruitless interview between the emperor and the pope<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Henry VIII, sub anno.</NOTE>. The impulse which Henry had given to the popular opinion, by his decisive conduct against Rome, agi∣tated all Europe. The north of Germany, the kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden, had already embraced the protestant religion: England had abjured the Roman influence; France and Scotland abounded with the disciples of Luther: and the crisis had suddenly become so new, and important, that the most skillfull politicians could not decide on its infinite combi∣nations and consequences.</P>
<P>James, who listened with pleasure and instruction to the conversations of Lindsay, and other learned protestants in his kingdom, was far from being decided in his resolutions con∣cerning the new system. A variance also appears to have pre∣vailed between him and his clergy, on account of the expence of the new court of justice; and they had appealed to the pope. Amid such dispositions it was remote from the interests of James or Henry to proceed to hostilities; and the attempt to excite a war appears to have arisen from disaffected subjects of one or both kingdoms; but most probably from the obstinate catholics of the north of England, where ignorance as usual nursed superstition. Certain it is that the Scotish historians ascribe the discord to the English, while the chronicles of the latter nation confute not the charge. Lesley blames William lord Dacre, the warden of the western marches, whose friend∣ship to Angus induced him to interrupt the peace:<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 435.</NOTE>: Bu∣chanan hesitates not to doubt Henry's own intentions, who,
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>strengthened by his intimate alliance with France, might hope to intimidate James from his connections with the pope and the emperor<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However this be, the first symptom of hostility which can be discovered is an engagement from Henry to Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Aug.</NOTE> for an annuity of one thousand pounds yearly, on condition of his services against his country<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">C. B. I, 129.</NOTE>. James on his side shewed the most prompt vigour.

<P>The earl of Northumberland, in a letter to Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> informs him that Mackay had gone from Scotland to Ireland with seven thousand men, and another thousand had recently been added; that their ravages were great though it was doubtful if they fell on Henry's subjects: that Argyle and Crawford might easily be won to the English interest, and Bothwell if delivered without indemnity; James having taken from Argyle and his heirs the government of the Hebudes, and many lands there, and in the extremity of Scotland, which were granted to Mackay: that the spiritual peers were inimical to James, except the archbishop of Glasgow, and the bishops of Dunkeld and Aberdeen, the king having endeavoured to raise ten thou∣sand crowns a year from the clergy; but the archbishop of St. Andrew's procured a bull, restricting his claim to four thousand pounds sterling, to be paid in four years<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">B.

<P>The mutual inroads became frequent, and destructive.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.</NOTE> Some Scotish hamlets were burnt: and in return a village, within three miles of Warkworth, was given to such a furious con∣flagration that Northumberland, lodging at the latter place, dressed himself at midnight, by the light of the devouring flames<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Fragment Northumberland to Dr. Fox, 22 Oct.

This scheme seems to have failed; but he detached fifteen hundred men who burnt Branxholm, the residence of Scot of Buccleugh a violent enemy of the English, and who had used satirical expressions against Henry. This inroad commenced at seven in the evening, and flaming villages marked its progress; and though Lidsdale was spared, to excite suspicion against its owners, the captives amounted to forty, with three hundred cattle, and sixty horses<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C.

<P>In return the Scots assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Nov.</NOTE> to the amount of three thou∣sand: of whom three hundred were sent to forage, and remain in ambush near the Cheviot mountains.

To secure the unanimous support of the frontiers,
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>James proclaimed a general amnesty, with the exception of Angus, his brother, and uncle<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">C. Northumberland to Henry, Nov. B. VI, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As neither king issued a declaration of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1533</NOTE> it is unnecessary much to prolong the account of mutual inroads, which were carried on with almost unexampled ferocity. For Murray, the Scotish lieutenant general, had ordered each quarter of the kingdom to detach successively a band of soldiers to the borders, there to remain for forty days, and assail the English limits with uninterrupted devastation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 44.</NOTE>. On the part of England, Angus and his brother sir George Douglas shone like destructive meteors, and blasted the Scotish territory by their presence, or proximity. The horrors of war, accustomed to attend the flowers of spring, now covered the snows of winter. Henry had detached sir Arthur Darcy to Berwick with a troop of chosen men, yet the Scots, in one of their incursions by the middle march, had advanced to Fowberry beyond Wooler, and returning with great prey, vaunted that "Darcy had brought them good fortune, while he and Angus slept well at Berwick<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hall, f. 212, 24 H 8.</NOTE> Stung by this reproach, these leaders made a destructive inroad, gave Dunglas castle to the flames; and ra∣vaged, in their return, the country around Duns<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 44. From two letters of Northumberland to Henry, April 1533, B. VII, 260, 265, it appears that sixty English had overcome 200 Scots led by John Home; that, on the 26th April, 200 Scots had invaded the English frontier, and burnt some villages, and the English had in return consumed Edring∣ton with avenging flames. The French embassador, M. de Beauvois, had pro∣ceeded from Alnwick to Coldingham; and Murray had proclaimed a cessation of hostilities, an example which Northumberland ungenerously did not follow.</NOTE>. But the only permanent feature of the war was the capture of a small old fort, called Cawmyl, two miles from Berwick, and now termed Edrington castle, by Angus and his brother; of which
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>they maintained possession with an obstinacy which had almost frustrated the pacific intentions of the monarchs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See the subsequent negotiation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry had sent lord Rochfort on an embassy to Francis, to impart his marriage with Ann Boleyn; and at the same time to mention the inroads of the Scots, and his design of chastising them<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Henry VIII, 369.</NOTE>. But Francis could not with decency permit the interruption of peace between his ancient and modern ally; and determined to send embassadors to mediate their disputes. Etienne D'Acques accordingly arrived in Scotland; and James, availing himself of the opporturnity, desired the renewal of the alliance concluded at Rouen, in 1517, by the regent Al∣bany<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 45.</NOTE>. The French envoy having no instructions to that effect returned; and David Beton was sent to accomplish this object. If it were denied, he was charged with letters to the parliament of Paris, representing the violations of the alliance by Francis, who on all occasions sacrificed the interests of Scot∣land to those of England, formerly esteemed their common enemy. If eventually constrained to deliver these letters, he was instantly to proceed to Flanders, apparently to form a strict alliance with the emperor<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. The application to the parliament of Paris was singular, but not un∣precedented, a national council having as mentioned in the reign of James III, ordered a similar mode of negotiation. The nature of the French parliaments seems to have been little known to other nations.</NOTE>. But Beton, a man of ad∣dress and ability, conducted the affair to an amicable termina∣tion.</P>
<P>To prevent an actual campaign between England and Scot∣land, another French embassador, Beauvois, arrived. James, by a letter of the fifteenth of May, consented to a truce with

<P>One of the chief objects of the conference between the pope and the emperor, mentioned under the preceding year, was to oppose or punish the defection of Henry VIII from the Roman faith. The influence of Scotland in this design attracted the consideration of the pontiff, who sent an embassador to James<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 436.</NOTE>. Clement VII spared neither presents nor professions, to secure the amity of the Scotish monarch, and his attachment to the doctrines of Rome.

His progress deserves some attention, as illustrative of the manners of the times. Hunting was his favourite amusement; and great was the slaughter of deer, roes, foxes, and of wolves, an animal then, and long after, not unfrequent in the Scotish forests. In Athole he was entertained, with singular magni∣ficence, by the earl of that designation. In the midst of a fair meadow a palace was constructed of green wood, entwined with the verdant boughs of birch: it was of a quadrangular form, and each corner was strengthened by a massy and lofty tower. The tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etted gate was not wanting; nor the security of the ditch, drawbridge, and portcullis. The floors were strewn with odoriferous herbs and blossoms; the walls were enlightened by numerous windows of fine glass, and adorned with silken tapestry. Nor did the enchantment of the genii of the forest fail to supply all that could appease or pamper the appetite of the royal hunter, and his woodland train. Meat and game of every description abounded; and the ditches were filled with the most delicate fish. Wines, white, claret,
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>muscadel, and malmsey, hyppocras, brandy, and the whole∣some beverages from malt, gratified thirst, or excited hilarity. The dessert was crowned with the choicest fruits and confec∣tions: and the vessels and linnen were worthy of a palace: nor were the luxuries of nocturnal repose, half of the life of man, unknown to the fairy mansion. The officers of the houshold, and of the kitchen, were numerous, and selected with care. Here Athole treated his royal guest for three days, and nights; and the expence of the entertainment, enormous for the time, was computed at three thousand pounds. The wonder of the papal embassador was yet further increased, when, upon the departure of James, the whole edifice, pre∣sented one conflagration; and the monarch only observed, with a smile, "It is the custom of our highlanders to burn their lodgings<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lindsay, 226—228.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Meanwhile the negotiations between the English and Scotish commissioners, at Newcastle, proceeded with great slowness; the minute and ridiculous affair of the restitution of Cawmyl, or Edrington, to Scotland forming the sole apparent obstacle. Beauvois, the French embassador, used every exertion for con∣ciliation; the place was not capable of holding sixteen persons; might easily be taken by the Scots, while it was remote from any English assistance: but the English mentioned the prizes which the Scots had taken at sea, and insisted that no restitu∣tion, except mutual and complete, could be granted<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">B.

He was, if possible, to procure the marriage of James with Mary the daughter of Henry; and most privately to adjust a meeting of the two monarchs and Francis<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. Aberdeen to Cromwell, May, B. III, 278.</NOTE>. But Henry was now little disposed to favour the elevation and in∣dependance of Mary, who had warmly resented her mother's divorce; and James, irritated by the refusal, protracted the conference. Yet the order of the garter was remitted to James, by the hands of lord William Howard brother of the duke of Norfolk: and the young monarch soon after received that of the golden fleece from the emperor, and that of St. Michael from Francis<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 439. In a list of writings in the Harl. MS. 4637, Vol. III, f. 81, is mentioned a letter of Howard, and Thomas Wall garter king at arms, <HI>dis∣pensing</HI> with James's assumption of the order, and dated Edin. 21 Feb. 1535. Guthrie V, 145, mentions dispatches of Henry and Howard at this time; but that careless writer has omitted to point out in whose possession they were.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While Henry was employed in the emancipation of his realm from the Roman superstition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August</NOTE> James was rivetting the chain upon his subjects by terror. Henry Forest a benedictine friar, and Norman Gourlay, and David Straton, two gentlemen, were convicted of the Lutheran heresy, and given to the flames<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 440. Spottiswoode, 66. Keith, 8.</NOTE>. James was induced to indulge his clergy in these cruel exhibi∣tions, more perhaps from political views, than from his native superstition. Henry's reformation of religion was of a singular
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>dubious kind; he seemed to have deprived the pope of the su∣premacy of the English church, merely that he might seize that lucrative office himself: and, though the event was to prove highly beneficial to his subjects, yet his motives were well known to be contemptible, and unworthy of the imitation of the Scotish monarch. While Henry at once persecuted the devotees of the pope, and the disciples of Luther, and set all law at open defiance, James can only be accused of permitting the ancient laws of his realm to be put in execution. The political con∣nections between Scotland and France also constrained James, if he did not wish to violate all the maxims of his ancestors, not to imitate and support the example of Henry, but to pre∣serve the system embraced by Francis. The latter monarch, after some hesitation, and even some inclination to the Lu∣theran doctrine, had, in the preceding October, held a con∣ference at Marseilles with the pontiff Clement VII; and his second son being there married to Catherine of Medici, niece of Clement, Francis became firmly decided in favour of the papal see<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini lib. XX, p. 471.</NOTE>. While the success of the protestant religion in Scotland was to instigate the writers of that persuasion to brand James as a tyrant, it is impossible for a politician, or philoso∣pher, to censure his conduct, as he was only hurried along in the necessary stream of public affairs. The executions on account of religion during his reign are few, nor do they equal those of one year of Henry: the attachment of James to his clergy was far from being servile, as his demand of contributions from them, and his imprisonment of the archbishop of St. Andrew's, may declare: and there is reason to impute the persecutions of the reformed not to any sanguinary or super∣stitious
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>motives, but to the unavoidable tide of political con∣nection, and opinion, in his dominions.</P>
<P>In the course of the summer James made a progress of justice into the northern parts of the kingdom, enforcing the dominion of the law; reprehending the negligence, and punishing the guilt, of culpable magistrates<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 440.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The English king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535</NOTE> having now completely broken the papal domination in his realm, and being about to suppress the mo∣nasteries, and appropriate to himself a part of the unwieldy and indecent wealth of the church, esteemed it more and more expedient to secure the amity of James, as that monarch might be induced to avail himself of the disaffection of the English catholics, and by their help aspire to the crown, or at least embarrass the procedures of Henry. So firmly had the con∣nection between Jesus Christ and his vicar, the pope, been rooted in the mind of ignorance, that the Scots, in common with the other catholics, regarded Henry's conduct as an abju∣ration of christianity, or indeed of all religion; blind zeal being ever prompt to brand any slight deviation from its own tenets with the name of atheism. To efface such impressions, Henry dispatched as his envoy to Scotland Dr. William Barlow, his chaplain, and bishop elect of St. Asaph, an eloquent preacher, and a warm enemy to the papal usurpations<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 405, 413. Buch. XIV, 50.</NOTE>. He was instructed to present to James a book now published by Henry, called "The doctrine of a christian man," in which the superstitions of Rome were exposed; and to examine the inclinations of the Scots on this subject, and even, if James should grant permission, to display his eloquence in the pulpit. But Barlow informed secretary Cromwell<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O. B. III, 194. He maliciously observes that in Scotland there was abun∣dance of "myserable beggars, and moneyless souldyoures."</NOTE> that
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>the council of James consisted only of clergy devoted to Rome, "the pope's pestilent creatures, and very limbs of the devil," as he charitably expresses himself; that it was rumoured by an officer belonging to Albany that France intended to declare in favour of the pope against England, and Scotland would as usual imitate her old ally; that James was himself of an ex∣cellent and generous disposition, but his spiritual council de∣cidedly inimical to Henry; that it was sarcastically said that he had only come to preach; and he would exert his elocution against the papal abuses if James would permit. But the clergy, the most opulent order in Scotland, had too much influence to leave any hope of such permission; and they forbad James to contaminate his eyes with the heretical production of the English king.</P>
<P>Henry, who was a complete stranger to the arts of conci∣liation, with his usual imprudence now sent lord William Howard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April</NOTE> a second time, as his envoy into Scotland; a man of haughty character, and unexperienced in affairs of delibe∣ration; and whose presence, as being of the family who slew his father, could only give pain to James. The meeting be∣tween the English and Scotish monarchs, proposed in the pre∣ceding year, was to have taken place in France, and in the presence of its king. But Henry's passage to that realm being postponed, in the present new and critical state of his own dominions, a conference with James at York was the object of Howard's mission; which, as was to have been ex∣pected in such hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Apr.</NOTE> proved unsuccessful. In a letter from Edinburgh<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Cal. B. II, 194.</NOTE>, this envoy informs his sovereign that he arrived at Stirling on good friday, where he found the Scotish king; who, when the conference was proposed, inquired if the envoy had brought any memoir of Henry's intended topics of con∣versation,
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>that he might shew it to his council; Howard re∣plied that such a procedure was never heard of before; and he imputes this singularity to the advice of the clergy, whose ma∣lice would even bind the tongues of princes: the envoy was then introduced to the council, who declared that, if James had given them information before he had promised a confe∣rence, they would not have granted their consent; but since the royal promise was procured the interview must take place at Newcastle, and not at York, nor before michaelmas, as James would not be prepared before that time. Howard ob∣jected the difficulty of Henry's accommodation between York and Newcastle; the delay he ascribes to a letter of Ottirburn, insinuating that Henry was himself inclined to procrastinate. The queen-mother was most eager for the conference between the kings; and even expressed herself with such warmth, that her son was displeased at her interference.<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Howard adds that the marriage with Vendome's daughter was frustrated, that James intended to marry lord Erskine's daughter, by whom he had a child; and that though she was married [to Douglas of Lochleven] a divorce was ready. He suspiciously mentions Sir James Hamilton, as the sole master of this secret. All this was mere scandal; and it is no wonder that James blamed Howard for such infamous reports. Keith, Hist. 18, note.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Buchanan reports that, to induce James to consent to this meeting, Henry offered his daughter, with the apparent suc∣cession to the kingdom; and in the mean time the titles of duke of York, and lord lieutenant of England<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 50.</NOTE>. But no ori∣ginal evidence is extant of such high proposals. The Hamil∣tons opposed the conference, as dreading the marriage of James: the clergy, from apprehensions of Henry's influence in promoting the defection of their monarch from Rome. They represented to him the danger of entrusting his person
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>in an inimical land; the kings of which had not in former times observed the most scrupulous faith to those of Scotland: they appealed to his policy, and his piety, in support of the religion of his fathers; and they lavished presents to all who had any influence with James, that they might dissuade him from the dreaded interview<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A parliament was held at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 June</NOTE> being the first of this reign of which a multitude of statutes is preserved<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 118—126. Keith, 12.</NOTE>. As we approach more modern times, and the state of manners and government becomes more known from other sources, it is unnecessary to narrate with equal minuteness the various ordi∣nances of the national council. Yet a rapid idea of the most important may not be improper. The progress of the protestant doctrine having instigated many to contemn ecclesiastical cen∣sures, they were ordered to be enforced by the civil power. Several salutary statutes of the first and second James are con∣firmed, and strengthened; as those concerning the planting of wood, the herring fishery, and others, which while they evince the good intentions of this legislature, impress at the same time a melancholy truth, that the course of a century had effected little or no progress in the civilization of the realm: and that, to adopt the terms of the present ordinances, "it was unpro∣fitable and useless to make laws, and statutes for policy to be had, except they be kept." To improve the breed of horses it was ordered, in imitation of an English statute, that stallions of a large size should be nurtured. As the borderers had been accustomed to make inroads into the industrious provinces, and seizing the cattle to convey them into England for sale, a de∣cree appears, prohibiting not only the sale of cattle and sheep to the English, but even that of corn<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In the original <HI>victual,</HI> a Scoticism.</NOTE>. fish, and salt. The
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>act concerning the fishery in the western seas was also rein∣forced.<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 120. The states approved the king's process for treason against Robert Lesley after his death, though no precedent appeared, f. v. 125. Glen∣dook, 122, gives this act as of 1540. The revocation of 1537 is, in the first edition, given at 1535. Both are sometimes inaccurate.</NOTE>. But the most important ordinance concerns the bur∣roughs. As many peers and landed gentlemen had procured themselves to be elected into the magistracy, and under colour of protecting the towns, had dilapidated their resources, it was ordained that the magistrates should thenceforth be chosen solely from among the substantial burgesses, and merchants; and that they should annually produce their accompts at the exchequer, after a public notice of fifteen days, that all the inhabitants might have an opportunity of examination and objection.</P>
<P>The repeated delays of the king's marriage excited the anxiety of an affectionate people. In case of his decease Al∣bany, the next heir to the monarchy, was now advanced in years, and had no issue; and the house of Hamilton indulged warm hopes of succeeding to the throne, though perhaps at the expence of a civil war. That family was strong in wealth, and vassalage; and the imprudent youth of James exposed him to every danger. An assassin might assail his life, while, in fatal security, he was attended by only one or two friends, on his nocturnal visits to his mistresses. Chance might perform the office of crime, while his courage exposed him to every danger. Often did he intrust his person to every vicissitude of the climate, passing days and nights on horseback, and snatch∣ing a scanty and fortuitous meal: often did he suddenly rush among desperate bands of freebooters, attended only by a few servants, and the terror of the royal name<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
<P>Charles V had, in this or the preceding year, sent Godes∣chalco Errigo from Spain to Scotland, to propose a matrimo∣nial alliance to James;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> but the project again failed<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 47.</NOTE>. A so∣lemn embassy proceeded to France, consisting of the earl of Murray lieutenant general of the kingdom, William Stuart bishop of Aberdeen, and lord Erskine; in order, if possible, to accomplish the nuptials of James. Francis had recommended a bride of the royal blood, Marie de Bourbon, daughter of Charles duke of Vendome; but James hesitated, for he aspired to Magdalen eldest surviving daughter of the French monarch; while her father opposed this marriage, as her consumptive state of health rendered her claim to the titles of wife and mother extremely dubious. But the embassadors were to re∣side in France, till James should send a decided mandate on the subject. Their mission was indeed chiefly a matter of pomp; for David Beton, who had remained in France, was the active negotiator, and by his abilities and address overcame the English influence in the French cabinet<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 440. Buch. XIV, 49, but he antedates this embassy a year. Sir Thomas Erskine of Kirkboddo, the secretary, appears to have been sent to assist Beton; for a commission to him to treat concerning the marriage in France, dated 12 Feb. 1534, appears in Scotstarvet's Calendars.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To apologize for the failure of the promised interview, James sent Sir Adam Ottirburn to Henry, to represent the improper conduct of lord William Howard, who had been at∣tended into Scotland by some followers of the Douglases; and had, on his disappointment, used menaces to the Scotish coun∣cil<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Keith, 18. Drummond, 203.</NOTE>. But Ottirburn himself listening to the complaints of Angus and his brother, James, upon discovering these prac∣tices,
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>betrayed the warmest resentment, which on the first opportunity he afterwards signalized on the imprudent em∣bassador<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">O. John Penman to Sir G. Douglas, 19 Oct. 1536, B. III, 293.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The remainder of this year was not distinguished by any important event. The silence of history commonly proclaims the happiness of a country. The spirited conduct, and wise regulations, of James had terminated the disorders occasioned by a long minority; feared by the clergy and nobles, and be∣loved by his people, he was now to enjoy the fruits of his patriotic toil, in the uninterrupted continuance of public tran∣quillity.</P>

<P>TO evince his gratitude to James for his attachment to the Roman see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1536 Feb.</NOTE> and to stimulate him to withstand the soli∣citations of the English king, the new pontiff, Paul III, sent Giovanni Antonio Campeggio on a solemn embassy into Scot∣land. He was instructed to represent Henry's conduct in the most odious colours; his divorce, his rapid marriage with Ann Boleyn, his schism from the catholic faith, attended by the
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>recent execution of Fisher bishop of Rochester for denying his supremacy of the church, afforded ample topics of declamation. An alliance between the emperor, Francis, and James, to punish the sacrilegious monarch was hinted; but a war existing be∣tween the two first mentioned princes, the scheme was dubious and dilatory. The idle pageants of a cap, and sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Feb.</NOTE> solemnly consecrated by the vicar of Christ on the night of his nativity, were added; not without an insinuation that the best use of the weapon would be, to direct its point against the English heresiarch<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Drummond, 201.</NOTE>. It also appears that the rage of Paul, stripping Henry of his ambitious title of defender of the faith, now con∣ferred that vain decoration on James<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 519.</NOTE>, whose prudence how∣ever prevented its open assumption. A permission to exact further contributions from the clergy probably presented to the Scotish monarch more forcible motives for continuing his de∣votion to the papal faith. Yet, though James had notified to Henry, both by lord William Howard and by Ottirburn, his wish that his uncle would refrain from further persuasions to induce him to follow his example in ecclesiastical affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE> he continued to distinguish Henry by the honourable appellation of his father, and to testify the warmest desire of a future in∣terview<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">O. Margaret to Henry 16 March, Cal. B. I, 158.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The embassadors of James in France concluded a marriage with Marie de Bourbon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Mar.</NOTE> daughter of the duke of Vendome, in consequence of a power from James, dated at Stirling the twenty-ninth of the preceding December. This nuptial treaty was solemnly signed by Francis, and by Albany, then on a bed of sickness, and it is believed, of death<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Leagues France and Scotland MS.

<P>John the eldest son of lord Forbes was accused by the earl of Huntley of high treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 June</NOTE> in having conspired to shoot the king with a culverin, during his residence at Aberdeen. Hunt∣ley was bound to substantiate the charge; and Forbes was com∣mitted to prison at Edinburgh. Six months after, his father was also imprisoned, while James was absent in France, till a security of ten thousand marks should be given that the con∣spirator should appear to undergo a trial<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Arnot's Criminal Trials, Edin. 1785, 4to, p. 1. In Oct. 1530 a remis∣sion had been granted to John <HI>master</HI> of Forbes for the slaughter of Alexander Seton of Meldrum; and for his traitorous "staying from the king's army at Solway and Werk [in the time of Albany's regency?]" Scotst.

So turbulent had this family been; so deserved was the wrath of James.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Irritated by the repeated obstacles to his marriage, doubtful of the private schemes of his negotiators, eager to accomplish an object ardently wished by himself and his subjects, secure of the tranquillity of his kingdom, the young sovereign determined on a voyage to France. The scheme was planned with the utmost secrecy, to elude the vigilance of Henry. And James suddenly embarking at Leith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 July</NOTE> accompanied by only two or three small vessels, proceeded towards France; but the wind proving contrary he was obliged to return: and the pilot en∣quiring where he should direct his course, the king answered "Any where except to England<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 52.</NOTE>." He then sailed round the northern extremity of Scotland, and by the isles of Leuis and Skey, expecting that the wind might become favourable; but finding this hope vain, or as some writers assert, the course of the ship being changed by some favourers of the Hamiltons, while James was asleep, he was constrained to land on the isle
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>of Bute, whence proceeding to the nearest port he returned to Stirling<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 52. Lesl. 441.</NOTE>. But the design being now public, it became neces∣sary for the king's honour to put it into immediate execution; and greater and more secure preparations were used: and to conciliate the favour of heaven, and propitious winds, James performed a pilgrimage on foot from Stirling to the chapel of the virgin of Loretto, situated near Musselburgh<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 442.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A commission of regency was signed by the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Aug.</NOTE> constituting James Beton archbishop of St. Andrew's, Gawin Dunbar arch∣bishop of Glasgow the chancellor, with the earls of Huntley, Montrose, and Eglinton, and lord Maxwell, to manage the public affairs during the absence of their sovereign<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Crawf.

James then sailed in a squadron of five vessels;<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 Aug.</NOTE> and was accompanied by the earls of Argyle, Arran, and Rothes, the lords Fleming, Boyd, and other men of rank, with about three or four hun∣dred attendants; and, after a prosperous navigation of eleven days, he arrived at Dieppe<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>After vain negotiations for peace, Francis was engaged in open war with Charles V, who, at the head of sixty thousand men, had passed the Var, and was now before Marseilles; whence, on the day after the arrival of James, he was forced to retire in confusion. Nor did the imperialists meet with much better success in Picardy. James could hardly have visited France at a more auspicious period. The French mo∣narch was at Lyon, inspecting the important affairs of the
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>southern part of his territories, and James embraced the op∣portunity of proceeding to Vendome, the residence of the duke of that title, and of beholding his intended bride with his own eyes. She displeased him; and the nuptial treaty was an∣nulled<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 442. Buch. XIV, 52. —Lindsay, 241, gives a lively account of the interview.</NOTE>. James then journied to Lyon, and was met at Mont Tarare, near that city, by Henry now dauphin of France, his elder brother Francis having died by poison on the twelfth day of August this year. This prince conducted James to his father, who received him with distinguished marks of affection and esteem. They immediately proceeded to Paris, where, though the court was in mourning for the dauphin, the reception of James was celebrated with all the accustomed pomp and magnificence of France, and of the age of Francis I<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 443. Lindsay, 242, displays his usual vivacity. Drummond, 205, places the meeting of Francis and James at the chapel between Tarray and St. Sophorin, in the country of Lyon.

Angus endeavoured to avail himself of the intercession of Henry with the French king, and of the general joy, to obtain a remission for himself and his brother, but in vain: in revenge his secret agent who attended the motions of James, a clergyman named John Penman, remitted to Sir George Douglas malicious and slanderous accounts of the actions and intentions of the Scotish monarch, from which however a few curious facts may be gleaned.<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See these curious letters, the first dated Rouen, 22 Oct. the second Paris, 29 Oct. in Cal. B. III, 293, seq. They were taken at sea, as the copies bear. For some of their scandalous expressions see the transactions of 1537. Their language is intolerably gross. Among other pieces of satire, the writer says that James is so foolish as to ride the streets of Paris, with a servant or two, supposing himself unknown, though the very car-men pointing with their fingers exclaimed, Voila le Roy d'Escoisse. He adds that some said James would de∣mand the daughter of France; others that his ultimate request would be Dun∣bar, a ship, and two or three horses—that James had sent love-tokens to Loch-leven's wife (his former mistress,) and, as some report, would marry her—that none dared to mention a Douglas to him—that he admitted counsel from none— that the earl of Moray contemptuously enquired for Sir James Hamilton his minion, who, as James said, had failed in his duty—and that Moray must be an enemy to James, else he could not display such malice in his conversations with the friends of Angus.
<P>In the second letter Penman mentions that many accused Sir James Hamilton, and James swore he should feel his vengeance; and that if he, the king, only looked on Angus, Hamilton would droop, "for by God's wounds when he and Angus met, Hamilton always turned the back seams of his hose." He also esteems the period favourable for the restitution of the house of Angus, as Francis could refuse nothing to Henry.</P>

<P>Sir James Hamilton was now overwhelmed with disgrace, and Oliver Sinclair was already distinguished by the favour of his sovereign, and accompanied him on this expedition. The earl of Murray evinced discontent by the freedom of his speech; and was perhaps disgusted by the rejection of the marriage treaty which he had accomplished. Argyle was the only enemy of Angus who attended James. As the castle of Dunbar, with its strong artillery, was still retained for Albany, lord Erskine and the abbot of Coupar were sent, with powers from Francis, to receive it in the name of James its proper master. On the twenty-ninth of October it was already determined that the Scotish king should marry Magdalen daughter of Francis; and
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>the twenty-fifth of November was said to be appointed for the nuptials; on which day James was also to give away at the altar the daughter of Vendome, his once intended bride, to the count of Auvais<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">So the MS. perhaps Beauvais.</NOTE>: and the future son-in-law of Francis was treated with all the distinctions allotted to the dauphin.</P>

<P>During the absence of James few transactions of moment had occurred. The lawless part of his subjects had been so much daunted by his vigorous administration, that the regency was quietly obeyed, though the original letters<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Instructions to Ray, after quoted.</NOTE> whisper a slight commotion in the north, which must have been easily suppressed. While James was at Rouen, on his return, he on the third, or more probably on the twenty third, of April made a solemn revocation of all grants past in his minority, prejudi∣cial to the crown, as having then attained the age of twenty five years or compleat majority<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 126.

Henry, jealous of his intimate connection with France, and suspicious of the papal influence over him and Francis, had in the end of the preceding, and the beginning of this year, sent successive envoys into Scotland, to inspect the state of affairs, and the disposition of the people, who were supposed to be excited by the clergy into a desire of war with England; an event the more to be dreaded, as great discon∣tents prevailed in that country.

<P>Sadler left Scotland in the beginning of February; and was followed, in April, by an envoy more obscure, and better enabled to perform the office of a spy. This was Henry Ray pursuivant of Berwick, whose instructions were, to sound the dispositions of the Scots to the reported war, and to perceive if discontents prevailed among them on account of a tax im∣posed by James, to defray the expence of his voyage to France, it being reported that a commotion had appeared in the north
<PB N="344" REF="350"/>of Scotland, whither some peers had proceeded with a military force: Ray was, above all, to paint the state of England as flourishing in unanimity, and to exaggerate the power of Henry<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">C. Instructions to Ray, B. I, 130. C. Other instructions to the same, B.

Buch. XIV, 53. Lindsay, 248. The dates differ as usual, Lindsay has the 5th, Lesley the 10th. Buchanan seems the most exact.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In narrating some events of this year, which have been thought to throw an indelible stain on the memory of James, the testimony of Buchanan, an ear if not an eye witness, shall be often followed; and he has the credit, notwithstanding his enmity to kings, and to this monarch in particular, of having given the most favourable account of those transactions, evi∣dently shewing that the country and times looked with the eye of candour, if not approbation, upon incidents which religious or party zeal was afterwards to magnify into acts of the most sanguinary despotism.</P>
<P>It has already been narrated, amid the events of the preceding year, that John Forbes, the eldest son of lord Forbes, had been accused of treason by Huntley. Buchanan says that one Strahan was the chief witness, a person of dubious reputation,
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>who conspired with Huntley against the life of Forbes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 53. Arnot, in his Criminal Trials, supposes that Forbes incurred enmity by being a protestant, because Buchanan says he was "et magnae familiae, <HI>et factionis,</HI> princeps;" but <HI>factio</HI> also implies a clan, or any band of followers; and is by the classical writers always used in a bad sense, so that Buchanan, a protestant, should use it to point out his own sect is not cre∣dible. On the contrary he would have dwelled on Forbes's principles, and ex∣tolled him as a martyr. It is rather to be believed that Forbes was, like the other northern peers, warmly devoted to the Roman faith: and his repeated crimes, mentioned under the preceding year, evince that his <HI>religion</HI> was not the object.</NOTE>. How∣ever this be, the latter was tried by Argyle, the chief justice, with the usual Scotish jury of fifteen; and in addition to the former charge of a design to assassinate the king, it was alledged that he was attached to England, and had engaged in a mu∣tiny excited at Jedburgh, while the Scotish army was on its march to defend the borders against the English arms. Forbes asserted his innocence to the last hour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 14 July</NOTE> but was found guilty and suffered at Edinburgh the death of a traitor<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Sir Thomas Clifford to Henry, 26 July, B. III, 187. Lesl. 446. Lindsay, 233.</NOTE>. Buchanan, who betrays ignorance of the delay of a year between the accu∣sation and the punishment, asserts that James was misled by the enemies of Forbes; but the trial remains<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Arnot, p. 1.</NOTE>, and there is every reason to believe from the delay, from the names of the jury, from the complete formality, that the guilt was substan∣tiated without any sinister influence. That James had no en∣mity to Forbes is granted by all writers; and he was at the same time so conscious of his own integrity, that he admitted the brothers of the traitor to his favour, and one of them even into an office in his family<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 53.</NOTE> a confidence perhaps unknown in that age of deep revenge, after any intentional injury, or dis∣honour, had been offered. Lord Forbes was soon released,
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>and the estate was unforfeited; so that no appeal could have been made to avarice.</P>
<P>The fate of Forbes, long protracted, excited little attention, when compared with a concomitant, but, as far as appears, a totally detached event. Within a week after the death of Magdalen, while James was lost in the retirement of sorrow, the nation was amazed with the discovery and punishment of another conspiracy against the life of their sovereign. The accuser was one Lyon, whose character even Buchanan does not pretend to impeach<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The person accused by Lyon attracted more commiseration, from the sex, from the rank, and even from the punishment. Jane Douglas, sister of Angus, widow of John Lyon lord Gla∣mis, and wife of Archibald Campbell of Kepneith, was the unhappy victim. This lady, her husband, her son the young lord Glamis, John Lyon his relation, and an old priest, were indicted for designs against the life of James, by poison, or witchcraft, with the intention of restoring the house of Angus. Lady Glamis was condemned to the flames, the savage punish∣ment of the imaginary crime of witchcraft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tuesday 17 July</NOTE> and suffered her fate on the castlehill of Edinburgh, amidst a croud of spectators, who ceased not to admire her mature, yet youthful, elegance of form, and the masculine firmness of her mind<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Buch. XIV, 54.</NOTE>. Her hus∣band Campbell, endeavouring to escape from the castle, was dashed to pieces on the rocks, which form the base of that sublime edifice. Her son, yet in extreme youth, was released but his lands were unjustly detained in forfeiture<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Lyon, in remorse, real or pretended, for the ruin of the chief of his family, endeavoured in vain to redeem the estate by avowing his accusation false, as Buchanan relates; though it be difficult
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>in that case to perceive how he could have escaped the iron hand of the law.</P>
<P>There were also imprisoned, on account of those treasonable designs, lord Forbes, William Forbes his cousin, the <HI>lards</HI> of Wedderburn, Whytingham, and Glaybarve, an esquire named Hugh Douglas, Robert Douglas, Peter Carmichael, Mr. Da∣vid Strahan, and several other persons<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">O. Sir Thomas Clifford to Henry, 26 July, B. III, 187. The writer says that lady Glamis suffered, "without any substanciall ground or proyf of mattir," but his testimony is that of an enemy, and the cause of the Douglases was patronised by England. It is worthy of remark that Clifford thus begins, <Q>“Please it your most Royal Majesty," whereas preceding letters bear only ”most noble grace.</Q></NOTE>, who all appear to have been dismissed without punishment.</P>
<P>Such were those transactions, over which some obscurity yet remains. Lesley briefly passes the affair; and our protestant historians in their enmity to James concur in denying the cri∣minality of the sufferers. They however allow that the king was deceived by accusers inflamed with personal enmity: and that he did not pardon is not surprizing, when it is reflected that the chief cause of the disorders in his kingdom arose from the lenity shewn to crimes by his predecessors, and the regents, with whom money was often equal to innocence; a considera∣tion which appears to have induced a vow, or resolution, of James, never to pardon those found guilty by the common course of law. The king was accused of indulging his just enmity to the house of Douglas in the punishment of lady Glamis: but with more justice may our historians be arraigned, for partiality to that family, a most potent and popular name in Scotland. Yet a friend of the laws, of the public tranquil∣lity, of the welfare of his country, will prefer the pacific vir∣tues of the royal house of Stuart to the turbulent fame of that
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>of Douglas; in foreign war the object indeed of admiration, but in domestic tranquillity, of the most severe censure. That the king, after forgetting that lady Glamis was the sister of Angus for no less than nine years after that earl's banishment, should suddenly, and in the very crisis of domestic and national affliction, exchange sentiments of sorrow for those of ven∣geance, seems neither probable in itself, nor agreeable to the laws of human nature. Even his enemies allow him to have been misled by false accusations: but it appears highly probable that the accusations were not false. The retired life of lady Glamis, alledged as a proof of her innocence, might only afford more room for secret guilt; and the ignorance of her friends and servants would only argue her prudence. Witch∣craft was in that age, and long after, firmly believed, and punished by fire, even in the most civilized countries in Eu∣rope: nor is it a crime in James that he was not a philosopher before philosophy was revived: perhaps the very death of the queen, which again left the king in a solitude deprived of pos∣terity, might have been by superstition imputed to magic, and regarded as a pledge of her husband's danger. The conspirators imprisoned on account of this last design appear to have been all adherents of the house of Douglas; Hume of Wedderburn was, by the mother, the nephew of Angus. That the earl was innocent may be admitted; but he was counselled by his brother Sir George Douglas, whose known violence was cer∣tainly capable of such a crime. James repeatedly expresses his apprehensions for his life, when he was kept in constraint by the Douglases<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Letters to Henry, 1528.</NOTE>; and in proceeding to the conflict of Linlith∣gow Sir George openly menaced his person. The intercession of Francis, during the residence of James in his dominions,
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>was the last, and vain, hope of the family. It's failure re∣duced them to all the violence of despair. The letters of Pen∣man to Sir George his employer, above mentioned, betray a malice and designs the most horrid. "The king is crazed, and ill spoken of by his people:" he has "beggared all Scot∣land:" "all are weary of him:" "James shall do the com∣mandment of the Douglases, God willing:"—"all hate him, and say he must <HI>go down:</HI>" "his glass will soon run out." These diabolical expressions against a prince in the vigour of early youth, what can they insinuate, but poison, or the dag∣ger? Could they be addressed to a person who did not seal them with approbation? And could a more sit, or secret, agent than a sister, be employed to promote the interests of her family at any risk? Nor is even the severity of her punish∣ment without excuse; for the vigorous administration of James might embrace the opportunity of teaching the turbulent nobles the important lesson, that the law knows no distinctions of rank.</P>
<P>About the same time Sir Adam Ottirburn, formerly em∣bassador in England, was imprisoned for intercourse with the Douglases, during his residence at London: and Chesolm a merchant of Edinburgh, attached to the English interest, in∣curred the same disgrace<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">O. Sir W. Eure to Cromwell, 12 June 1538, B. III, 249. Magnus in 1525, B.

<P>James continued his attention to his military preparations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> His artillery at Dunbar, Tantallon, and other fortresses, oc∣cupied much of his care.<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 July</NOTE> Sir Thomas Clifford informs Henry<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Letter above quoted.</NOTE>, that, for a month past, James had at least twice in the week secretly repaired to Dunbar, at twelve o'clock in the night, or after that hour, with a train of only six persons; and, after remain∣ing
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>a day or two, returned also by night: that the Scotish ar∣tillery was in excellent condition, James lending it his whole attention, undiverted by any pleasure: and that Berwick from its ruinous state was exposed to imminent danger. It is im∣possible to divine the intentions of the Scotish monarch, who might perhaps wish to avail himself of the discontents in the north of England to recover Berwick: that he aspired to the English throne, by the aid of the catholies, seems dubious; and the birth of a son to Henry, in the ensuing October, must have extinguished the idle hope, if ever entertained<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Robert Holywell, an English fanatic, visited Scotland this summer, to ex∣ercise his trade as a sadler. He heard different Scots say, as they read books of prophecy, that James would be crowned in London, about midsummer in the third year thereafter, (1540.)

See his con∣fession, Cal. B. I, 122, dated 12 June, 29 H 8, 1538, and signed "Per me Edimundum Walsyngham."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Margaret, the queen-mother, now in her forty eighth year, had proceeded so far in a divorce against Methven her husband, that the sentence was written, and ready for public pronun∣ciation; when the king, sensible of the ridicule, commanded it to be stopped<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>As soon as decency would permit, an embassy was sent to France, to conclude another marriage for James. Mary of Guise, daughter of the duke of Guise, and widow of the duke of Longueville, was the object of the royal choice; and the chief embassador was David Beton abbot of Arbroth, for his former services rewarded by Francis with the bishopric of Mi∣repoix

<P>Meanwhile James further enriched his coffers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1538</NOTE> by assigning the opulent abbacies, and priories, of St. Andrews, Holyrood-house, Melrose, Kelso, and Coldingham, to his natural child∣ren, whereby he became intitled to draw the revenues of these benefices, till the nominal possessors should have arrived at the years of maturity<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 447.

<P>The prosecution of the protestants, intermitted for three years by more important objects, again commenced with fresh vigour. The celebrated Buchanan was among the number of those imprisoned; who escaping first passed into England, and thence to France. His satire on the Franciscans, while it pleased James (who was inimical to those busy and jesuitical friars, being far from bigotted, and only protecting the clergy because their opulence could best pay for his favour,) had given the deepest offence to the church, and the poet prudently withdrew from her resentment<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Buch, vita propria. The date 1539 on the margin is erroneous, and, not to mention that it occurs again afterwards, it disagrees with the "brevi post" in the text, after transactions of 1537: nor does Buchanan mention Mary of Guise, who arrived in June 1538, after he had left Scotland: nor was cardinal Beton in France in 1539, though Buchanan found him there in 1538 the real year of his escape. Yet, in his unchronological history, he dates the event 1539: if not an error of the press in the vitiated first edition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The second matrimony of James being concluded, Mary of Guise proceeded to Scotland, conducted by an admiral of France, and lord Maxwell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 June</NOTE> The queen landing at Balcomie in Fife,

<P>The new marriage which afforded a prospect of progeny strengthened the government of James, who continued to hold the rein over his nobles with a more severe than politic hand.

Bib. Reg. 7, C. XVI.</NOTE>. Sir William Eure appeared for Henry; and Mr. Thomas Ballenden and Mr. Henry Balnavis for the Scotish king. This affair of little moment in itself, is connected with an important letter from Eure to the lord Privy Seal of England<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">O. ibid.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Jan.</NOTE> in which he narrates some conversations with Ballenden, a man of aged experience, and eminent abi∣lities, concerning the court and character of James, on which they reflect a new and strong light. In Ballenden's opinion
<PB N="357" REF="363"/>James, and the temporal lords of his council, were inclined to a reform. A play<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">A sketch of this play is given, from which it is clear that it was the original draught of Sir David Lindsay's noted drama, called a Satire on the Three Estates, printed at Edinburgh 1602, 410, and reprinted London 1792 in three volumes of old Scotish poems. The uncommon personages, and plot, compleatly iden∣tify the production; but the introductory farce of the old man and his young wife was too indecent for the eye and ear of Mary of Guise, and was only added in 1552, as appears from a date in it, which led the editor to inser that all the play was of that epoch.</NOTE> had been represented at Linlithgow, on the late feast of epiphany, before James, his queen, and the spiritual and temporal peers, the purport of which tended wholly to the reformation both of church and state. At the end of this theatrical effort, James addressed himself to the chancellor, and the other bishops, and desired them to pro∣mote a design so meritorious, else he should send six of the proudest of them to Henry, and as they were ordered so should he order the others. The chancellor mildly answered that one word from their monarch was sufficient to induce them to amend: but James replied with some warmth that he would not spare many words, though he suspected that their effect would be vain. Ballenden desired a copy of the English acts of parliament against the papists, for the private study of James; insinuated that he intended to expell the spirituality from all civil offices and affairs, and that after the queen's co∣ronation<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">She was now pregnant; and James was preparing ships for his celebrated voyage of this year. Ibid.</NOTE>, which was fixed for the first day of February, a convention of the peers was to be held, in which, as was re∣ported, a reform of the spiritual order was to be the grand ob∣ject of deliberation.</P>
<P>The emperor Charles V, having proceeded to Paris to hold a conference with Francis I<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Henry VIII, 514. Mezeray, Abr. IV, 608.</NOTE>, the English monarch became
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>more and more alarmed, lest the pontiff should persuade James to join these princes in an attempt to deprive him of his do∣minions. To frustrate this intention, if entertained, Henry dispatched Sir Ralph Sadler on an embassy into Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb.</NOTE> His instructions were<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Sadler's Letters, Edin. 1720, 8vo. p. 1.</NOTE>, to excite suspicion against cardinal Beton, now the prime minister and chief counsellor of James: to persuade this monarch to abjure the authority of Rome, and to seize the monasteries: and to found his intentions concerning the reported league against England. But Henry's avarice only sent a present of a few horses to conciliate James, though he must have known that the gold of France, and of the church, abounded in the Scotish court, and that it ought to have been balanced by a profusion, more laudably shewn in securing peace, than in maintaining war; though this was a truth which all his past experience was never to teach him. Yet the embassador was further instructed to allure James by the hopes of the English succession, if prince Edward died; a vain expectation, which prudence could never weigh against present and solid advantages.</P>
<P>A negotiation so unskillful in its foundations terminated as was to have been expected. The letters produced to raise jealousy against Beton, and which were said to have been found in a Scotish ship wrecked at Bamborough<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">This, though denied by the Scots, appears to have been the truth, for it is mentioned in a letter from the council at York to Cromwell, 5 Jan. 1539. Cal. B. VII, 245.</NOTE> were di∣rected to Rome, but James avowed his previous knowledge of the contents. He refused to seize the possessions of the church, as he asserted that the clergy were always ready to supply his wants, and any abuses were of easy reformation: when Sadler stated the useless and wicked lives led by the monks, the king's
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>impatience answered,, "By God they that be naught you shall hear that I shall redress, and make them religious men accord∣ing to their professions." To the article concerning a league against England, James firmly, and it is believed most justly, denied any such intention, with solemn asseverations, and even with oaths. And Sadler having proposed a conference with Henry, the Scotish king objected, expect that Francis were also to be present, as was indeed the original proposition six years before. He however added that he was always in∣clined to the conference, but the lords opposed the design<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Sadler's Letters, 15, 55, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some other points of this memorable embassy deserve atten∣tion. Sadler avers that the clergy had presented to the king a list of not less than three hundred and sixty of the chief nobles and barons, whose estates might be confiscated on a charge of heresy, and that Arran stood at the head of the roll<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 101. James rejected this roll of proscription with high indignation. Knox 30, ed. 1644. Keith, 12.</NOTE>: that James said the clergy dreaded him, but praised the cardinal as devoted to his interest<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Sadler, 56, 57.</NOTE>. The embassador found that the king was well inclined, but was forced to use the council of the clergy, as the nobles wanted capacity<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ib. 61. Yet the clergy were so grossly ignorant as to mistake a Greek de∣vice for Latin, and ludicrously misinterpret it, p. 63, 64.</NOTE>. Yet the churchmen were unpopular, especially Beton who had recently issued a proclamation ordaining the death of a heretic to any person who should eat an egg on forbidden days<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ib. 62.</NOTE>; as it is indeed the infatuation of a falling system to consider trisles as barriers, and defend them with insane obstinacy: and it is thus that the ve∣hemence of party drives the many to opposite extremities of the field, while the wise and moderate few are left in the mid∣dle exposed to the weapons of either side. The nobles and
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>gentlemen disposed to the reformation Sadler found numerous, but chiefly in the younger class of men<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 61. More minute objects of this embassy are, that Sadler was in∣structed to remonstrate to James against his keeping stores of sheep, and other mean modes of increasing his revenue, p. 6. A ridiculous and affronting pro∣position, but such were Henry's methods of conciliation! James, p. 38, denied the charge, and said the sheep were kept by his tenants on his lands. But the monarch must, to his high praise, be confuted, "for he had ten thousand sheep going in the Etrick forest, in keeping by Andrew Bell, who made the king as good count of them, as they had gone in the bounds of Fife." Lindsay 237. Nor can any thing be more odious than to hear vice blaming virtue. Sadler had his first audience when James was at mass, p. 24, a common practice with our monarchs ever formal in religion. The king's fondness for hawks, herons, and the river, is remarked, p. 59.</NOTE>; for the aged seldom adopt new opinions, however incontrovertible, being unwil∣ling to confess their acquired knowledge to be vain, and to yield to youth the palm of experience. Twenty years were accordingly to elapse, before the benefits of the reformation were to extend to Scotland.</P>
<P>The situation of James had become extremely difficult; and it is no wonder that he was soon to fall a victim to the em∣barrassment, as it might have confounded the most aged and skillful politician. The majority of his nobility and people were now decidedly inclined to the reformation; which was regarded as an object even of necessity in Scotland, as the clergy engrossed almost the whole wealth of the country. No sovereign was ever more zealous for the benefit of his realm than James V, and his consent to the desired change would have proved, in the issue, highly fortunate to himself and his people. If he despised the selfish aims of Henry, there were before his eyes the glorious examples of his ally Frederic I of Denmark, who established the protestant system in his domi∣nions in 1526; and of the heroic Gustaf Wase of Sweden,
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>who three years after followed the same maxims. Yet both these events were the consequences of revolutions; and it re∣quired a mind strong even to violence, like that of Henry VIII, to change an established system, so deeply interwoven with every branch of government. The gross imprudence of Henry in the management of the English influence in Scotland, but particularly in supporting the infamous Douglases against their sovereign, even till the death of James, must have ren∣dered his conduct and counsels suspicious, and deservedly to be shunned. He had in a manner forced James to six a connexion with France; a political tye which of itself forbad him to adopt a system reprobated by his most powerful ally. The talents of the clergy, particularly of Beton, the incapacity and illiterature of the nobles, the matrimonial alliance with the bigotted house of Guise, all afford motives operating to excuse James: and we may lament, but cannot in candour blame, when we perceive that prince persist to the last in the religion of his ancestors.</P>
<P>The Scotish monarch had long revolved an important design, highly honourable to his abilities and intentions, and to his de∣sire of promoting the union, tranquillity, and happiness of the realm. His vigorous and prudent government had reduced the borderers, and other marauders, to subordination. The isles, and northern extremities of his kingdom, alone remained in ignorance of the laws, and of his power to enforce them: He determined to visit them in person, attended by a force sufficient to chastise the insolent chiefs, and to inspire respect to the guardian of the public order. The voyage was worthy of the intrepidity, and wisdom, of the monarch, being almost as dangerous as one of distant discovery, the people and the very shores being unknown; and the patriotic prince ordered,
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>for the general benefit, a skilful pilot, Alexander Lindsay, to attend him, and report the nautical observations<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">They were translated into French, and are extant in a beautiful MS. Harl. 3996, "avec augmentation, et illustration, de plusieurs figures, et descriptions, tres neceffaires pour la navigation; par Nicolas de Nicolay de Dauphiné, geographe du roi." The translator's travels in Turkey were printed about 1570. In a dedication to the cardinal of Lorrain, whose campaign at Amiens is men∣tioned, Nicolay says he procured the original when he was in England, from Northumberland the admiral of Henry VIII. These nautical remarks are also printed at Paris, 1583, 4to: and in the Miscellanea Scotica, London, 1710, 8vo.
<P>Our historians have erred in the date of this noted voyage. Lesley puts 1539: Buchanan 1534, and is followed by later writers. But the epoch is ascertained by a letter of James, (MS. Epist. R. S.) to Henry, dated 29 July, of his reign the 27th year—1540, in which he says that as there was no complaint on the borders, he had visited the isles, north and south, to introduce justice and policy; that in his absence redress was denied by the English wardens, till a hawk and a deer were restored; and he sends Rothsay herald to remonstrate.</P>
<P>The date is also evinced, from the birth of the eldest prince, which was on the 22d day of May 1540, as appears from a letter to Henry of that date, the 27th year of his reign, mentioning the birth of a prince "and successor." Ib. On the 2d Nov. 1540, the lands of Morton were given by James to Andrew Mitchelson, for bringing the tidings. Scotst. Cal. sub data. Langton's letter, (B. I, 145, after quoted,) concerning the intended navigation, as to take place on the 29th of May, states the birth of a prince; and that the Scots made bonfires on trinity sunday at night, which day in 1540 was the 23d of May.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Arrangements were accordingly made for this interesting expedition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">beg. May</NOTE> The services of Maxwell, though admiral of Scotland, were declined on this occasion<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">O. Sir Edward Aglionby to Sir T. Wharton, 4 May, B.

Twelve ships, with ample artillery, were ordered to be ready by the four∣teenth day of May. Of these six were allotted to James, and
<PB N="363" REF="369"/>his own immediate dependants, and soldiers. Three were appointed solely for victualling the fleet. The remaining three were separately assigned to the cardinal, Huntley, and Arran: Beton being to conduct five hundred men of Fife and Angus; Huntley, besides gentlemen and thirty of the royal household, was to lead five hundred of the north; to Arran was given the similar command of five hundred of the west, exclusive of the gentlemen, and twenty-four servants, in his train<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Aglionby's letter, B.

<P>The queen's pregnancy was so far advanced that her deli∣very was daily expected: as James could not decently be ab∣sent at the time, a delay of more than a fortnight was the consequence<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">O. John Thomson to Sir T. Wharton, 4 May, B. III, 219, which adds that her delivery was expected about trinity sunday.</NOTE>. Meanwhile England became suspicious of the intentions of this armament: some asserting that James de∣signed a voyage to France, or Flanders, to meet Francis, or the emperor: others reported Ireland as the probable destina∣tion, as in lent eight Irish gentlement had arrived at the Scotish court, with letters from most of the great chiefs of Ireland, offering homage to James, if he would support their religion against Henry's innovations<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">O.

<P>When the cause of delay was thus removed, the royal standard streamed from the admiral ship; the sails were hoisted, and the squadron advanced down the majestic course of the Forth, amid the acclamations of numerous spectators on the adjacent hills and shores. They knew not their king's design; but a patriot and a philosopher would have joined their general voice, had he beheld this youthful monarch, after having with the wis∣dom of years, amid innumerable difficulties, with repeated im∣minent hazard to his person, established the internal tranquillity of his realm, now proceeding on a voyage, not of war and de∣struction, but of public benefit; and committing his safety to the tempests, rocks, and shoals, of unknown and perilous seas, in order to spread law and civilization through his dominions.</P>
<P>Circumnavigating the variegated coasts of Fife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> the bold aestuary of the Tay, the populous shores of Angus, Mearns, and Buchan, studded with commercial towns and romantic villages, the royal fleet doubled the promontory of Kinnaird, passed the rocky heights of Ord, the heathy wilds of Caithness, and displayed the royal banner to the intrepid and industrious natives of the Orkneys, who had now begun to exchange their ancient Gothic ferocity for the mild arts of peace. Little or no exertion of authority was here required: and after charts and nautical remarks, concerning the Orcadian seas and inlets, had been arranged by Alexander Lindsay, the pilot, the squa∣dron passing the marshy wastes of Strathnavern, doubled the desert and perilous cape of Hvarf or Wrath, which exposes its stern front to the hurricanes from Greenland, and to the mountainous waves of the Atlantic ocean. The distant and
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>lawless inhabitants of Leuis, Harris, the Vists, rushed from their muddy hovels to gaze on the lion of Scotland, and trem∣bled when they beheld the artillery of the public guardian le∣velled against their crimes. The power of the Macdonalds the allies of England, the foes of their country, had been long extinguished; but the Macleods obeyed the royal mandate with conscious fear, and were detained in captivity. Nor did the chieftains of Skey, and the barbarous western shores, escape a similar fate. Again bending his course to the ocean, James visited the isles of Col, Tirey, and Mull; and perhaps sighed over the tombs of his ancestors at Hyona. The indented shores of Argyle, the islands of Jura, Ilay, and Colonsay, the rugged promontory of Cantire, the verdant hills of Arran, Bute the residence of his fathers, did not elude the monarch's presence, or attention, his applause of peaceful industry, his chastisement of depredatory insolence. Many of the chieftains were led away in bonds; and James ordering some ships to re∣turn with them by their former course to Leith, landed at Dunbarton, after one of the most laudable expeditions ever undertaken by any sovereign<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lest. 448, 449. Buch. XIV, 48. Lindsay, 236.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The chieftains seized were detained in several prisons, as hostages for the obedience and tranquillity of their people, and continued in bonds during the life of the king. The prin∣cipal names were Macleod, Macdonald, Maclain, Macconnel, Macneil, Mackay, Macintosh, Mackenzie, with many others<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 448, Lindsay, 236.</NOTE>. So effectual was this policy, that peace, industry, and a com∣parative degree of wealth, began now reluctantly to visit the western shores, and isles, of Scotland; and hardly is there a

Though a council of regency had been appointed, during the absence of James, the letters proceed in the royal name. This vo∣lume might have been greatly augmented by the insertion of many curious let∣ters from the MS. Reg. 18 B. VI, which seems to have been quite unknown to Ruddiman the learned editor.

Evandale was gradually won from the Stuarts, the lords, Cal. June 1533, Sept. 1534. The tower of Nauthan (or Draphan) on "the water of Nauthan," lands of Crossford, &amp;c. were acquired from the abbot of Kelso in 1532, as appears from a confirmation of the charter, 4 Jan. 1539. The tower of Nathane, and the lands of Draphan, are also confirmed 14 Aug. 1539. On the 22d Sept. 1539 many lands were granted to Sir James, for building the palaces of Linlithgow and Stirling. Ib. In Oct. that year Sir James granted Glengavel in Evandale, Lanarkshire, to Margaret and her husband Methven. Ib.
<P>The stories concerning Sir James, detailed by our protestant writers, seem invented to shew the judgments of God upon persecutors. It appears not that he was ever restored to the favour of James, and how could he be a judge of a spiritual court? Was Beton's ambition inclined to give up his favourite prero∣gative to him? The circumstances seem to equal in veracity the apparition mentioned by Lindsay and Buchanan. Had Sir James been just appointed to a high office, he would hardly have conspired against his sovereign, whose conti∣nued neglect alone seems to have induced him to designs of desperation.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>During his patriotic voyage James had heard, or observed, that great intrusions were made by the fishing vessels of Hol∣land, Flanders, and Bremen, on the privileges of his subjects in the seas of Orkney and Shetland, by advancing too near the shores, and not only interrupting the Scotish fishers, but some∣times even forcibly compelling them to withdraw; a boat with twenty native sailors having, on one of these occasions, been funk with all its people by the guns of the strangers<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Epist. Reg. Sc. II, 81—84.</NOTE>. The monarch, ever awake to the interests of his realm, ordered Maxwell, the admiral of Scotland, to sail to the islands, and notify his resolution to punish such attempts: but Maxwell finding them refractory, he ordered one or two sailors from each foreign vessel on board, then seizing one of their ships, in order afterwards to convey them to the continent, he in the mean time brought them to Leith. Being produced before the privy council, they were charged, on the penalty of just retaliation, to abstain from such inimical practices, and letters
<PB N="368" REF="374"/>were sent to the several states certifying the king's firm reso∣lutions on this subject<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Epist. Reg. Sc. II, 81—84.</NOTE>. They were then dismissed in their own vessel, and probably attended to the prohibition for a few years: but the complaint exists in full force even in our time.</P>
<P>A parliament assembled at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Dec.</NOTE> wherein James not only confirmed the revocation of all lands, offices, and posses∣sions, alienated from the crown during his minority, formerly issued by him at Rouen, but published a new act of annexation of lands to the royal domains. It comprizes all the isles, "north and south of the two Cantires," that is the Hebudes; the annexation of which to the crown was a stretch of power, but not unjust, when the constant disaffection and depredations of the chiefs are considered, and highly salutary for the pro∣motion of tranquillity and civilization. The Orkney and Shetland islands follow: and are succeeded by the lordships of Douglas, Crawford-Lindsay, Crawford-John, Bonkill, Preston, Tantallon, Bothwell, Jedburgh forest, and the superiority of the county or earldom of Angus. Other forfeitures annexed are Glamis, and its dependencies; Lidsdale, seized three years before, the earl of Bothwell its possessor being attached to the Douglases: and Evandale the property of Sir James Hamilton<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 127—f. v. 133. Lidsdale had been assumed in 1537, as appears from Cal. B. VII, 232, quoted under that year. Buchanan, XIV, 53, says Bothwell was banished in 1537; erroneously, for, in the end of 1539, he dates some charters at Aberdeen, perhaps just before he went to Italy. Our histo∣rians are always strangers to chronology. It is even doubtful if he were ba∣nished at any time, as he repeated his treasons in Dec. 1542, and was absolved in 1544. Epist. R. S.

To argue against the pope's authority imported death: private conventicles, or con∣ferences on religion, were forbidden: heretics who abjure are not nevertheless to converse with catholics; nor, (with singu∣lar and truly ecclesiastic severity,) can a person even sus∣pected of heresy be admitted to any office, or privilege, either in the boroughs or elsewhere: fugitives for heresy are held con∣demned, and any correspondence with them strictly prohibited: and rewards are offered for the discovery of any protestants. Yet, by an ordinance of vague interpretation, the clergy are enjoined to reform their manners, and shew more attention to their duty<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Keith, hist. 14, 15.

These godlike exertions to diffuse the blessings of industry, art, and civilization, through his realm, proclaim the praise of James in a style far superior to studied panegyric. Invited by his fame, as the patron of every useful labour, some Germans had visited Scotland, and endeavoured to discover gold in the mines of

<P>To divert their grief for the loss of their children, and to en∣courage the progress of learning in their dominions, James and Mary of Guise honoured the university of Aberdeen with a so∣lemn visit. The scholars vied in their attempts to entertain the royal guests: comedies, probably of Terence or Plautus, dis∣putations on all branches of literature, orations in the Greek and Latin languages, sufficiently interested James and his con∣sort to prolong their stay for fifteen days, when they left the university, after bestowing warm applause on the proficience of the students, and the liberal attention of William Stuart the bishop to the prosperity of the institution<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 451.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Sir John Campbell of Lundy again proceeded on an embassy to the Netherlands; his business being to procure a proper re∣gulation for the fishing vessels, employed on the Scotish coasts, which had given umbrage to James in his voyage of the pre∣ceding year.

For himself he aspired to the legateship of Scotland, as Wolsey had held that of England. But there were apparently other, and more im∣portant, schemes in agitation, between the pope, the emperor, Francis, and James, against Henry, whose knowledge of them probably produced the war of the ensuing year. But while
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>this important embassy itself is unknown in the careless pages of our history, it is no wonder that the motives should remain in darkness. In this much the character of Beton, now the Wolsey of Scotland in power and pride, may instruct us, that the in∣terests of the Roman see, and the destruction of heresy, were grand objects of his mission.</P>
<P>Availing himself of the absence of Beton, Henry appears to have again sent Sadler into Scotland<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See his long and curious instructions, quite different from those of 1540, Cal. B. I, 52—70. The mention of Henry's intended progress to the north seems, with other circumstances, to evince the date to be 1541. The Lancaster herald had lately returned from Scotland. Lindsay, 253, specially dates, and avouches, this embassy of 1541, after which Henry, as he says, proceeded to York; but he errs in repeating the names of the embassadors of 1535.</NOTE>. He was instructed to expose the art of the pontiff, and to warn James against any belief to be lent to the scandals propagated against Henry by the papal clergy: he was politely to desire the Scotish king not to transform himself into a brute, or a stock, as the clergy would persuade him to be. "The practises of prelates and clerks," say the instructions, "are wondrous; and their juggling so crafty, that, unless a man beware thereof, and have as many eyes as Argus, he may be lightly led by the nose, and bear the yoke, yea and yet, for blindness, not know what he doth<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">"The practises of prelats and clerks be wondrous, and thair juglyng so craftie, as oneles a man beware thereof, and as oculate as Argus, he maye be lyghtly ledd by the nose, and beare the yoke, yea and yett for blyndnes not to knowe what he doith." F. v. 62.</NOTE>." The embassador is therefore to desire James well to weigh and consider their practises: and, if he be inclined, Henry shall send a wise man to instruct him or meet him himself, as he was that summer to perform a progress to the north of England. Sadler is also to insinuate that the supposed intention of the pontiff is to arm the emperor, France, and Scotland, against
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>Henry; and with no great art, or historical knowledge, the example of James I is to be repeated to the Scotish monarch, as if his ancestor had voluntarily and freely assisted the fifth Henry in his French war, and upon his death attended his body to London as that of a dear ally.</P>
<P>James appears to have lent a deaf ear to the homilies of Henry; but overcome by persistance, to have given a dubious promise that, if his affairs and opportunity permitted, he would meet the English king on his progress in the north of his dominions.</P>
<P>Henry accordingly proceeded to York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 20—26</NOTE> where he remained at least six days. But James declining the conference, his uncle returned to London with sentiments of deep indignation<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 533.</NOTE>. The anger was unjust, for if the English king were so desirous to meet James, why not evince at once his spirit and conci∣liatory views, by visiting the court of Scotland, after so many recent similar examples of confidence among the greatest mo∣narchs?</P>
<P>Yet nearly a year was to elapse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542</NOTE> before open hostilities were to be displayed. James sent an embassador to Henry to excuse, in the most conciliating manner, his failure in the expected interview<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Henry's manifesto, in Hall's chronicle, f. v. 247.</NOTE>. But the assumption of the title of king of Ireland by Henry, who had formerly been contented to imitate the modesty of his predecessors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Jan.</NOTE> in admitting only the style of lords of that illustrious island, where the English possessions were indeed minute, was to occasion fresh jealousy between the monarchs<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 539. Lesl. 453. In the beginning of this year, O Neil, the ally of James, paid his submission to Henry at Greenwich, and was created earl of Tyrone. Hall, sub anno. In Feb. 1542 James granted a safe conduct to the papal envoy, sent to O Neil and the lords of Ireland. MS. Reg. 18 B. VI.</NOTE>. Not only were many of the Irish chiefs
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>ancient allies, or dependants, of Scotland; but some Scotish clans had actually settled in Ireland, and were understood to be among the immediate subjects of James. Yet the failure of the expedition of Edward Bruce, and the want of a strong fleet, prevented the Scotish kings from asserting their claims to that island; and though the catholic chieftains warmly de∣sired the protection of James, he, with some impatience, was constrained to concede the high title of king of Ireland to the ambition of Henry.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the continued artifices of the clergy, to instigate James to a war against his heretical uncle, commis∣sioners appointed on both sides met on the borders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 July</NOTE> and issued the accustomed mandates for the preservation of peace<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Henry's manifesto.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Beton had now probably returned from his embassy, and it's apparent object had been in some measure defeated by a rupture between the emperor and the French king; which diverting the arms of both rendered an alliance against Henry impossible. Francis had already invaded the dominions of his adversary, in five different places; but far from pursuing his former policy he declined any connection with Henry, and sent Morvilliers as embassador to Scotland, with a supply of arms and ammunition to James, who was to be another victim of French policy<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 456. Herbert, 543, 547.</NOTE> It is probable that Beton's zeal had flat∣tered Francis with the wild idea that England, being disaf∣fected, was ready to receive James as her sovereign. The wishes of a partizan, and still more those of a bigot, will often impose on himself, and misrepresent even the most ma∣nifest dispositions of a whole nation: and it is probable that Francis, trusting to Beton's complete information on the sub∣ject, in some shape authorized by repeated insurrections in the
<PB N="377" REF="383"/>north of England, should have been thus induced to leave James to conduct the war against that kingdom alone; a con∣duct which seems otherwife incompatible with the known generosity of the French monarch.</P>
<P>It had long been the decided wish of the Scotish clergy to impell their king to a war against England, in order to prevent him from embracing the measures of his uncle in opposition to the Roman see. But the haughty and despotic spirit of Henry seems to have also conspired to the destruction of James. Lord Herbert, the able and accurate historian of his reign, affirms that a rupture with Scotland had been resolved upon; and Paget was sent to Paris, in consequence, to sound the disposition of Francis towards a continuance of the alliance with England; whom he found averse from the proposal<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 541.</NOTE>. Henry was highly enraged at the failure of the interview, which he particularly hoped, and desired, in the absence of Beton; and, finding conciliatory measures vain, determined to overawe James to his purpose by the force of arms. Yet even of Henry's resentment the Scotish clergy were the sole authors; and they cannot be acquitted of causing the destruction of an amiable monarch.</P>
<P>The first act of hostility seems obscure:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> but if the Scotish borderers made an incursion, such events were provided for by the alliance between the two kingdoms, and were redressable by commissioners<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Henry, in his manifesto, asserts that the Scots on the 4th July suddenly en∣tered England, to commit ravages. Yet James, in a letter to Lermont his embassador, (MS. Epist. reg. Sc. 20 Aug. regni 29,) asserts that the English made two incursions before the Scots retaliated. The council of Scotland, in a letter of the same date to Lermont, say that the English had ravaged Paton, Aymouth, and other towns in the Merse; while, on their side, James Doig, who led the <HI>futaband,</HI> or infantry, that burned Carham and Cornwell, was cashiered. Huntley the lieutenant proceeded to the frontiers that day, the 20th Aug. but an offer is made to withdraw the garrisons, if Henry will do the same.
<P>Lesley, 455, says the English took 28 Scotish vessels. But the incident is ques∣tionable, for both the kings, and all the original papers, are silent. Yet this event may have happened after Henry's manifesto appeared. See Holinshed, Hist. Scot. who confirms Lesley's account, and his book was printed in 1577, a year before Lesley's.</P></NOTE>. The Scotish embassador remained at the
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>English court: yet after many small incursions on both sides, sir Robert Bowes, instigated by the odious Angus and sir George Douglas, who attended him in the expedition against their country, entered Scotland at the head of three thousand cavalry, proposing to ravage the frontiers, and destroy Jedburgh now emergent from its ruins.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Aug.</NOTE> But they were met at Haddenrig by Huntley and Home, and completely defeated: Bowes, Richard his brother, sir William Mowbray, and others, to the amount of six hundred, being taken prisoners<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lesley, ib. Lindsay, 264. Remission to the Douglases, Nov. 1544, Epist. R. S. II, 321, 323.</NOTE>; and Henry was to complain in his manifesto that they were not admitted to ran∣som. Angus was also taken, but escaped the due punishment of his manifold treasons, by using his dagger against the captor. James was however so much pleased with this omen of success, that he gave the lands of Hirsell to sir Andrew Ker of Little Dean, for bringing the first intelligence<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Hume's House of Douglas, II, 109.</NOTE></P>
<P>Exasperated by this disgrace to his arms, Henry ordered an army of twenty thousand men to assemble at York, under the command of Norfolk lieutenant of the northern counties. But James, who appears not to have been prepared for the war, into which his evil counsellors, and Henry's impetuosity, had hurried him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> sent embassadors to York<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">C. James to Henry, 10 Sept. Epist. R. S. MS. in bibl. Reg. Mus. Brit. 18 B. VI.
<P>James had written to Henry, on the 25th August, that the English and the Douglases, with 10,000 men and five banners, had invaded Scotland; but his lieutenant (Huntley) had met them, and the event there was no necessity to relate. MS. Reg. 18 B. VI. This epistle would little contribute to appease Henry.</P></NOTE>; and Norfolk agreed
<PB N="379" REF="385"/>to treat. James hinted a consent to the desired conference; but the place being still a subject of hesitation, and the instructions of the embassadors so inadequate as to afford cause of suspicion that delay alone was intended, the negotiation was abandoned<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Henry's manifesto.</NOTE>. Henry ordered his army to march; and at the same time issued a manifesto<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See it apart in the British Museum, London 1542, 4to; or inserted in the chronicles of Hall and Holinshed.</NOTE> reviving the antiquated claim of homage from Scotland to England, supported by many fabulous examples from partial records, and monastic legends; but at the same time disclaiming any intention to enforce it, and imputing the war to the interruption of the conference in the preceding year by James, after he had given his promise; to the support afforded to the rebels in the north; to the denial of some small debateable territory; and to inroads committed by the Scots, even during the negotiation. No manifesto of James has reached us; and that of Henry has in itself little weight.</P>
<P>Yet the intermediate treaty had been so long protracted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Oct.</NOTE> that the usual season for a campaign had elapsed before Norfolk entered Scotland, at the head of a gallant, though not nu∣merous army, hardly exceeding thirty thousand men. He gave to the flames about twenty villages, and the towns of Roxburgh and Kelso: but the progress, though destructive, was not deep; a Scotish army of ten thousand, under Huntley, Home, Seton, and Erskine, watching every advantage to annoy the English, and preventing the extension of the ruin by detachments. At Farneton the bishop of Orkney, and sir
<PB N="380" REF="386"/>James Lermont, came to Norfolk's camp, as embassadors for peace; but without effect: yet, after an incursion of eight days, the English general was constrained by the want of pro∣visions, and the advanced season of the year, to lead his army back to Berwick, and dismiss the soldiers to their respective abodes<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lesl. 457.

<P>James finding a determined and ruinous war to have com∣menced, perceived too late that his conduct to the nobles had been the reverse of that of his father, and that their unanimous concurrence, experienced by James IV, was not to be expected by a prince, who had, on repeated occasions, sacrificed their interests to those of the clergy. Many of the Scotish chiefs had also embraced the reformed doctrines; and the present being not unjustly regarded as a war incited by the papal clergy against the chief supporter of the new faith, it became an object of pious zeal to counteract its progress. In vain did James endeavour to recover the affections of the aristocracy; for he now countenanced the priests, who gave in a new roll of proscription, and confiscation, against the numerous pow∣erful and wealthy heretics<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Keith, 12, from Knox, p. 31.</NOTE>. His conduct was only supposed to be covered with a mask, soon to be removed, and to dis∣close the most petrifying features. The discontent of the peers ripened into murmurs, or was yet more dreadful from the deep silence which precedes a tempest. Their power had been irri∣tated, not crushed, as that of the English lords by Henry VII. Their numerous sollowers considered themselves as only bound to the obedience of their chieftains; the regal name had no
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>superlative sound: and the Scotish army may be said to have as yet consisted of twenty or thirty separate hosts of rude mi∣litia, who, connected by the firmest tyes of tenure, obedience, and protection, to their distinct leaders, only respected the mo∣narch as the nominal commander in chief. On the contrary, the English battalions were not uninitiated by foreign wars in military tactics, and discipline; and any local attachments had been so broken by the fall of ancient families, and by the pro∣gress of civilization, that they moved as one mass at the voice of their general; and knew no fear, save that of dishonour, and the frown of their monarch.</P>
<P>Though aware of these disadvantages, James had, on the rupture of the negotiation, ordered an army of thirty thousand to assemble at the Burrowmuir near Edinburgh; and had marched to Fala,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.</NOTE> near the western extremity of the noted chain called Lammermuir hills, being twenty miles on the route towards Kelso, when the tidings arrived that Norfolk had withdrawn his forces<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lest. 457. Lindsay, 269.</NOTE>. The Scotish peers ungenerously seized the opportunity; and partly from disaffection, partly perhaps from the not forgotten terrors of Flodden, declared that they would only act on the defensive, and, as the enemy had retired, would not retaliate the invasion. James, sus∣pecting a repetition of the scenes exhibited at Lauder bridge, under his grandfather, was forced to dismiss the array,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Nov.</NOTE> and return with inconceivable chagrin<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Nisbet in his Heraldry, Vol. I, p. 98, produces a charter to John Scot of Thirlstane, granting an addition to his arms, and the motto <HI>ready ay ready,</HI> to reward the support of the king at Soutra, when all the other chiefs desired to retreat. It is dated at Fala moor, 27 <HI>July</HI> 1542; an error in the date, or a forged charter, as not only history, but the original papers of August concur to evince.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
<P>To allay the anguish of his mind, the council, consisting chiefly of clergy, proposed to levy a small army of about ten thousand, to retaliate, by an invasion on the western marches, the injuries and disgrace inflicted by the arms of Norfolk<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Norfolk wrote to James on the 10th Nov. concerning an exchange of pri∣soners. Haynes's Papers, p. 3.</NOTE>. Maxwell was appointed to the command, a leader indeed firmly attached to the king; but, with their usual infatuation, the ministers of James joined with him Cassils, Glencairn, and other chiefs of the south and west, who favoured the English interest and the reformation, whereas those of the opposite party, however distant, ought to have been selected. The army advanced towards Solway firth, passed into English ground, and approached the river Esk, when Oliver Sinclair, the king's favourite, was elevated on shields, to read the royal commission, appointing the general and directing his procedure. A murmur arose among the disaffected that this minion was nominated commander in chief: and the array, like a troubled sea, was instantly agitated by uproar, tumult, and disorder. Thomas Dacre and John Musgrave, two English leaders, had advanced at the head of three or four hundred men to observe the motions of the enemy; and perceiving their dissentient fluctuation, and an incapability of defence arising even to panic, immediately charged their scattered battalions. A speedy flight completed the inglorious disaster. Among a thousand prisoners, taken by the English, were Glencairn, Cassils, Maxwell, So∣merville, Gray, Oliphant, Fleming, with other chiestains of inferior note, who preferred a captivity in England to the chance of their sovereign's indignation<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lest. 459.

<P>On the 9th Nov. 1542 James wrote to the pope, mentioning the invasions of Bowes and Norfolk, the first at the head of 10,000; the latter of 40,000. He asserts that the war is waged because he will not abandon the pontiff; and he desires aid as the flame may spread to other kingdoms. MS. Reg. 18 B. VI.</P>
<P>In the same curious MS. there occurs a letter from James to Henry, 30 Nov. in the thirtieth year of his reign 1542, on occasion of the murder of Somerset herald, in Scotland, by William Leth and John Preistman English sugitives, and who were immediately imprisoned by the command of James. He shews every sense of the enormity of the action, terms it "an unhappy and cruel enterprize," and an "odious crime;" is earnest that it shall be punished; and desires a safe conduct to Lermont and Sir John Campbell, envoys to be sent to receive Henry's instructions on the business. Herbert, p. 548, glances at this trans∣action, known to Hall and Stow; but I cannot find it in Lesley, whom he quotes; nor in Drummond, who is cited by Dr. Granger the continuator of Maitland, Vol. II, p. 834.</P>
<P>The next letter in the MS. is from the council of Scotland, 21 Dec. 1542, acknowledging the receipt of Henry's letter of the 10th directed to James, who was dead before it arrived: and surrendering the murderers to the just vengeance of the English king.

<P>James, in his impatience, had advanced to the castle of Carlaveroc, to learn with more speed the success of his arms. The repeated and cruel reverses of fortune at Fala, and at Solway, overcame a mind strong, but uncultivated by philo∣sophy or experience, and yet untaught to cure the stings of disappointment with the balm of hope. The clouds of disho∣nour darkened around his magnanimous soul, hitherto long brightened with success and glory; and no ray pierced the horrid gloom of despair. In his eyes his reputation was irre∣trievably lost: and that loss a generous spirit cannot, would not, survive.

<P>THAT paradoxical philosophy which supposes man more happy in a savage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488—1542</NOTE> than in a civilized condition, will never find converts among the sons of science. To solid in∣formation, to enlarged views, to candid discussion, to genuine ratiocination, the idea will ever appear a dream of ignorant genius, a vision of the golden age of the ancient poets:
<Q><L>Di latte</L>
<L>Se'n corse il fiume, et stillò mele il bosco.</L></Q>
Whether we peruse the imperfect records of barbaric ages, or the page of the modern traveller, which delineates nations yet
<PB N="387" REF="393"/>in infancy, and represents antiquities coeval with ourselves, the comparative misery of the savage will ever appear predo∣minant. Few and insipid are his enjoyments, the animal pleasures merely animal, unheightened by anticipation, by memory, by imagination, by the thousand nameless elegancies of civic life. To seize his prey in the romantic forest, or pastoral stream, is not his amusement, but his occupation, filled with cares lest his want of success should leave himself and his family to famine. From the delays, suspence, and anxieties, of judicature he is free, but he is exposed to lawless violence; he defrays no taxes, but he enjoys no security of person nor property; his merit is not suppressed by the malice of party, the insolence of office, nor the frigid frown of drop∣sical wealth, but it expires unseen and uncelebrated, like the flowers of his forests. A stranger if not to the miseries, yet to the unfeeling ridicule, which in mercantile states attends penury, he is equally a stranger to that ease which opens and enlarges the mind to pleasures before unknown, and is itself one constant enjoyment. Free from some of the cares of ci∣vilized life, his uncultivated mind is exposed to all the fury of the passions. The day of puny conflict, the tortures of the captives, are feasts to his sanguinary disposition; and if he die bravely, it is because he feels that his existence is miserable. In his eyes there is no providence, life and nature are a form∣less mass without intelligence or plan; and he dies a stranger to all the enlightened virtues, utilities, and decorations of life. If he expose his children to the wild beasts, or sell them as slaves; if he bury his father alive, when too aged to procure his own subsistence; if he offer human victims to grim idols, stigmatize his forehead with their blood, perhaps devour their flesh, can we praise his mercy? If he take every opportunity to rob the stranger, can we praise his honesty? If he be falla∣cious
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>as uneducated infancy, can we applaud his truth? If his festival be riot, his love brutal lust, where is his temperance? If he prefer assassination to open combat, where is the generous courage of a man? If his strength oppress the weak, if his sly cunning circumvent the unwary, where is his justice? Where are his virtues, except in the want of opportunities of vice? Where in short are all the vaunted morals and enjoyments of the savage, except in the theoretic page of fanciful philosophy?</P>
<P>But whether the sum of the contentment of the poor, for happiness is too bold a word for human existence, be greater in barbaric or in civilized ages is a different question. Among our German ancestors, when the whole produce of agriculture was equally divided among the tribe<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Germ.</NOTE>, there could be no posi∣tive poverty, except it deservedly fell on the gambler, who would pledge his property, and sometimes even his person, as a stake<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The chiefs, originally chosen for their courage, wisdom, and superior personal appearance and strength, having a larger share in any warlike prey, became opulent in horses, herds, and flocks, the sole wealth of the country, and epoch. Inheritance may be termed an innate idea among all nations; the sons of the chiefs became rich in the fortune of their fa∣thers; and distinguished by their opulence, and in time by the deeds of many ancestors, they became kings, or nobles, of the small community. A further progress erected one king over a wide territory; and the former petty princes sometimes were eradicated, sometimes became only the barons of a more pow∣erful state. But the barbarians, nations of soldiers, either acquired their subsistence by prey, or by lasting conquests, or by sharing the bounty of their chiefs; and the slaves alone could be termed poor.</P>
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
<P>The usage of slavery among ancient nations prevented any occasion of beggary. In distress to become slaves, was the last refuge of the miserable; and their master provided objects for their industry, and subsistence for their lives. The chris∣tian system did not oppose this practise: the early christians had their slaves<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Among other authorities see an inscription in the Recherches sur les Anti∣quités de Vienne of Nicolas Chorier, Lyon, 1658, 12mo, p. 221.</NOTE>; and though the popes, in the ninth century, prohibited the Venetians to sell believers as slaves to the Ma∣hometans<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Anastasius vita Zachariae Papae, an. 747; Danduli Chron. Venet. an. 878.</NOTE>, yet the poor people of England continued even to the twelfth century to sell their children as slaves to the Irish<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Wil. Malmsb. Vita Wulfstani, Anglia Sacra II, 258. Chronicon Hib. Domit. A. XVIII, an. 1172. Thorkelin's learned tract on the slave-trade in Europe, London, 1788, 8vo.</NOTE>. But modern charity would shrink from the advice of a great political writer<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Fletcher of Salton, Disc. 2, on Scotish affairs, p. 87, edit. 1749.</NOTE>, to restore the custom of slavery as the only mean of deliverance from the recent evils of beggary and poors'-rates: an opulent manufacturer never supporting the sick, aged, or helpless; while a rich Roman would not only employ five thousand slaves, but furnish an asylum for all in every stage of existence.</P>
<P>In a more immediate view of the present topic, it appears that the condition of the poor, as well as of the rich, is greatly ameliorated by civilization. New disadvantages, it must be confessed, arise; the population becomes so numerous that the subsistence is of course more difficult: and hardly, except in civilized society, can the poor man shun marriage, or execrate the increase of his family. But this defect may often arise from the fault of the governors, occupied in futile wars, factious plans, and the miserable chicane of office, instead of attending
<PB N="390" REF="396"/>to their sole duty, the general welfare of the community. The poor however, instead of being the slaves of their landlords, are free to carry their industry and skill to the best market, and share in the social opulence: the uncertain life of a soldier is exchanged for security, and comparative ease: their little pro∣perty is sacred from violence: and they exult when they see the evening smoke ascend from their cottages, and welcome their return from labour to a peaceful meal, and chearful fa∣mily; nor can the rich forbear to envy their night's repose.
<Q>Man wants but little, nor that little long.</Q>
As the wants and wishes of the poor are but few and moderate, they have far more numerous opportunities of gratifying them in civilized, than in barbaric, society: opulence opens the hand of charity, and the stores of foreign commerce contribute to the wealth or comfort of the peasant; while the very scenes rising around him, the attic mansion, the improved town, the na∣vigable canal, not only encourage his industry, but increase his enjoyments; as it has been observed that a Neapolitan <HI>lazarone</HI> would not exchange conditions with a Russian noble; so much of the pleasure of existence is derived from surrounding objects. And such is the influence of industry in advanced society, that the poor enjoy conveniencies which, in a barbaric state, the great would account luxuries. Granting all human conditions comparative, we may estimate the advantages of civilization by the voice of the savage, and of the barbarian: what English sailor, though exposed to the rage of enemies, and fury of the ocean, ever envied the American savage? what English men∣dicant, the rude Siberian? But the savage chief will be proud to share the habiliments, or little luxuries, of the mariner; the Siberian would envy the dainty provisions, and luxurious ease, of the mendicant. By the same plan of providence, in which man arises from infancy to youth and maturity, from
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>which he is soon to decline, human society has its progressive stages of amelioration, till it attain the highest state, after which it tends to declension.</P>
<P>The progress of Scotland towards civilization, during the reigns of James IV and V, appears to have been somewhat more rapid than at any preceding period, though the minority of the latter prince formed a considerable interruption. The statute alone, of the former monarch, concerning education is worthy of an ancient legislator. But it concerns the rich only; and this section is devoted to the state of the middle ranks, and of the poor. Among the ordinances chiefly intended for their advantage, may be enumerated those for the preservation of the public peace against the inroads of the great; those pro∣hibiting the levying of <HI>capies,</HI> or pretended benevolences of horses, cattle, or the like, accustomed to be wrested from the poor by the landlords in Galloway and Carric<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, 1490, c. 8, 18, 19.</NOTE>. The statute of James I, concerning mendicants, was ratified both by James IV and V<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">1504, c. 70. 1535, c. 22.</NOTE>. It was ordained that no officer should dis∣train instruments of agriculture in the season of tillage; and that forestallers of grain, flesh, fish, or other articles, should forfeit the whole. Lands falling in ward are not to be injured; and the tenants, labourers, and other inhabitants, are not li∣able to be removed till the expiration of their yearly lease, at the ensuing whitsunday: and all are permitted to sell grain all the days of the week, as well as on the market day. The tenants of the royal domains are especially exempted from any services to the adjacent landholders<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">1504, c. 98. 1535, c. 21. 1491, c. 26. 1493, c. 44. 1490, c. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But from other authorities it appears that great oppression of the farmers, and cottagers, still prevailed; and the landlords
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>continued to prefer their pride to their interest. "The lords, says queen Margaret in a letter of Sept. 1523, regard not the disasters of the poor, but laugh at them." Though the leases were generally annual, we find excessive <HI>grassums,</HI> or fines for renewal, arranged among the grievances of the time<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ancient Scotish Poems, Edin. 1770, p. 51, 261.

The sufferings of the poor peasants, by the extortions of the clergy in particular, form a considerable part of Lindsay's sa∣tyrical play, first acted in 1540<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Scotish Poems, London, 1792, Vol. II.</NOTE>. At a far later period the author of an interesting memoir concerning the state of Scot∣land, about 1590, observes that the husbandmen were a kind of slaves, only holding their lands from year to year; that the nobility being too numerous for the extent of the country, there arose too great an inequality of rank and revenue; and there was no middle station between a proud landholder, and those who, having no property to lose, were ready for any tu∣mult<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">MS. Sloane 3199, art. 94, extracted from MS. Ashmole 781, p. 11.</NOTE>. A rich yeomanry, numerous merchants and tradesmen of property, and all the denominations of the middle class, so important in a flourishing society, were long to be confined to England.</P>
<P>John Mair in his description of Scotland, 1521, presents some particulars worthy of commemoration. He mentions Leith as the chief port, and observes that, between it and Edinburgh, there was a small but rich village, famous for the woolen manufacture, and from which the best cloths in Scot∣land derived their name. Perth was the only fortified town, the Scots being little versed either in fortification, or siege; but
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>displaying great promptitude in repelling an enemy. The ecclesiastic polity was far inferior to that of England, there being often thirty hamlets attached to one parish church, distant from some of them four, five, or even ten miles: but every laird had his chapel and chaplain, and some more. The cures were few, but rich; and generally administred by depu∣ties. The houses of the farmes were small, because they only rented by the year, at the most for four or five; so that, though stone were common, there was no desire to erect good houses, to plant trees or hedges, or to enrich the ground; and Mair justly expresses his regret for the consequent loss, and disgrace, to the kingdom at large. He adds that if perpetual leases were granted, the rent might be tripled, and yet the tenants become rich; and the homicides which followed their removal be avoided, for a tenant of spirit would kill his successor to despite the lord. Nor would the lords have cause to alledge that, in case of long leases, the tenants being independent would not arise with them in arms, for a law might pass ordaining in such defaults the loss of the lease: and better it were that the superiors could not so speedily recur to force. Mair repeats an advice of Robert the great on his death-bed, that the Scotish kings should attempt to retain all the isles in their own hands, as abounding with cattle and warriors; and the detached go∣vernment being most pernicious to the interests of the mo∣narchy: the possessors to be recompensed by other lands. He blames the farmers for their contempt of manufactures, and of citizens, whom they regarded as effeminate: while they, leaving the agricultural operations to servants, affected to ride constantly with their lords, perhaps a respect necessary to se∣cure their brief leases. The nobles he equally censures for perpetual feuds with their neighbours; and a complete neglect of the education of their sons. Mair closes his interesting
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>remarks by describing the highlanders as partly possessed of cattle and horses, of which last two or three hundred, wild and unbroken, would be brought by one highlander to Perth or Dundee, and sold for two franes each: but the others more savage only hunted, or followed their chiefs, in their constant expeditions and conflicts. They wore <HI>caligae,</HI> or trouse, reach∣ing only to the middle of the leg, a mantle, and a shirt stained with saffron, their weapons a bow and arrows, a broad sword, small halbert, large dagger of one edge; armour, mail of iron rings: but the common people wore in battle jackets of quilted linnen, waxed or pitched, and covered with deer's skin; while the lowlanders like the English fought in short clokes<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Hist. lib. I, c. 6, 7, 8. Boyce's idle clocution in his description of Scot∣land, and account of manners, presents not one particle of solid information.

<P>There being no manufactures, the poor were chiefly occu∣pied in the numerous menial trains of the great; or in the more useful employments of agriculture, and pasturage. The cottagers and servants of farmers, were almost as rich as their masters; and far less harrassed with care. But barren are the materials to form an estimation of the state of a million of poor, while a few thousands of more fortunate families attract alike the notice of the heralds, and the old annalists.</P>
<P>In the burghs, the chosen seats of freedom, the advance∣ment, as may be expected, was greater. The regulations concerning them are numerous. In 1490 it was ordered that the usages of Edinburgh, in raising the rents due to superiors, should be extended to Perth, and other burghs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 20.</NOTE>. An act of
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>1491 prohibits any numerous meetings, except commanded by the magistrates<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cap. 34.</NOTE>: the revenue of each burgh is ordered to be expended for ts advantage, by the town-council and deacons of crafts, who are to be responsible yearly in the circuit-court of the chamberlain; and no description of their property is permitted to be let for a term exceeding three years: no cor∣diner, nor other craftsman, is to exact a duty from one of the same trade coming to the market to sell: deacons of craft are not allowed, as the practise tended to commotions and oppres∣sion; and masons and carpenters are not to charge for holidays<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. 36, 42, 43.</NOTE>. In 1504 it is ordained that the provosts, and other magistrates, be changed annually, and that none except resident merchants be appointed: the ancient privileges are confirmed, and none except freemen of burghs are permitted to trade, sell wine, wax, silk, spices, stuffs, or staple goods<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Cap. 80, 84.</NOTE>. The important statute of 1535, concerning the magistracy, is already stated in the historical narrative.</P>
<P>More minute statutes occur concerning the prices demanded by artisans, which are ordered to be regulated by the magis∣trates; who are also impowered to affix those of wine, salt, and timber, imported. But the cordiners, smiths, bakers, brewers, and other craftsmen, continuing their extortions, their prices are referred to a committee of the lords; and malt∣makers are only to charge two shillings advance on each boll of barley<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">1494, c. 56. 1541, c. 100. 1535, c. 30, 29. From c. III, parl. 1541, it appears that the craftsmen pretended to make "private acts and constitutions" among themselves; their gross injustice perhaps induced our kings to establish the oligarchic form of municipality. Lindsay in his Play, p. 191 seq. censures the arts and extortions of weavers, clothiers, millers, butchers, taylors, brewers, bakers, carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, goldsmiths.</NOTE>. To prevent forestalling it was decreed, in 1541,
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>that no fish should be sold in the markets to retailers, except between the hours of eleven and two, and the price is sub∣mitted to the magistrates. A statute of the same parliament permits all the subjects to sell bread and flesh, on three market-days in the week, at Edinburgh the capital, on account of the great resort of natives and strangers<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cap. 98, 121, 122.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Even about 1590 the author of the memorial above men∣tioned observes that the burghs were chiefly influenced by the neighbouring peers; Coupar by Rothes, Perth by Montrose, and other instances. The merchants were few and poor; and one hundred pounds sterling was esteemed wealth. The trades∣men were lost in the popular penury; and only three trades flourished, coarse cloth, armour, and linnen. There were also few lawyers except at Edinburgh<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ut supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When such was the state of the lowlands, that of the high∣lands was far more barbarous. On the death of James V one John Eldar, a clergyman who, as he informs us himself, was a native of Caithness, and had studied for twelve years in the three <HI>southern</HI> universities, retired to England, and presented to Henry VIII a Project of a Union between the two king∣doms. It is an ignorant and traitorous exhortation to the English king to subdue Scotland, and expell cardinal Beton, and the bishops; but it presents some curious articles concern∣ing the manners of the highlanders. In explaining the reason of the appellation <HI>Redshanks,</HI> given to the highlanders, he thus proceeds. "Moreover wherefore they call us in Scotland Redshanks, and in your grace's dominion of England <HI>Rough-footed Scots,</HI> please it your majesty to understand, that we of all people can tolerate, suffer, and away best with cold: for both summer and winter, (except when the frost is most ve∣hement,)
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>going always bare-legged and bare-footed, our de∣light and pleasure is not only in hunting of red-deer, wolves, foxes, and <HI>graies,</HI> whereof we abound and have great plenty; but also in running, leaping, swimming, shooting, and throwing of darts. Therefore in so much as we use, and delight, so to go always, the tender delicate gentlemen of Scotland call us <HI>Redshanks.</HI>"</P>
<P>"And again in winter, when the frost is most vehement, (as I have said,) which we cannot suffer bare-footed, so well as snow which can never hurt us, when it comes to our gir∣dles, we go a hunting; and after that we have slain red-deer, we flay off the skin by and by, and setting of our bare foot on the inside thereof, for want of cunning shoemakers, by your grace's pardon, we play the coblers, compassing and measuring so much thereof, as shall reach up to our ancles: pricking the upper part thereof with holes, that the water may repass where it enters; and stretching it up with a strong thong of the same above our said ancles. So, and please your noble grace, we make our shoes.

He afterwards makes re∣marks on highland names; such as that Macleod ne Hair implies <HI>filius Ludovici de Hirtha insula:</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enny <HI>filius Kennoci,</HI> &amp;c. and he adds that in Ireland the name passes from grandfather to grandson, as Obrien, <HI>nepos Bernardi.</HI> In the reign of James V he says the attendants of the highland lords were dressed like the lowlanders, who term the former wild, rude, and barbarous: and he flatters Henry VIII with the possession of many "good hearts" among the Irish lords of Scotland, as he always terms them: his goodness being thus synonymous with treason. Botero in his <HI>Relationi Universali,</HI> or description of the world, Fer∣rara, 1592, 8vo, says of the highlanders, p. 491, "Parlano la lingua d'Hiber∣nia, onde tirano origine, e si chiamano salvatiche."</NOTE>."</P>

<P>The manners and dress of the common people of Scotland, during this period, may best be discerned from the contempo∣rary statutes, poems, and other writings. In 1504 it is or∣dered that no markets nor fairs be held on holidays, nor at any time in churches or church-yards<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cap. 83.</NOTE>: a regulation which now appears singular, because the ecclesiastic origin of fairs, <HI>feriae,</HI> and markets is forgotten. The market for grain and meal being in the high street of Edinburgh, James V ordered it to be moved to a more convenient place. In 1535 the act of James I concerning inns was reinforced; and the barons, and magistrates of burghs, were ordered to see that the inn∣keepers sold flesh, fish, bread, and ale, at the rates usual in such houses; and had proper stabling, racks, mangers, corn, hay, and straw: the penalty, indictment at the justiciary court<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">1541, c. 103; 1535, c. 18.</NOTE>.</P>

Even the women are branded by Dunbar, and other poets, for drinking ale, or malmsey if they could procure it, to excess<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, Vol. I, p. 113, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The <HI>plays,</HI> or annual festivals mentioned in a former retrospect, seem to have been retained till the reformation, about which period a poet mentions that at Bowden<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tale of the Friars of Berwick, perhaps written by Dunbar, presents a curious picture of the domestic life of a farmer. His house has a <HI>but</HI> and a <HI>ben,</HI> or two apartments, and several other conveniences. Two friars arriving are treated with bread and
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>cheese and ale, being favourites with the women, to whom they repeated tales, and miracles of saints: but for a treat to her lover, another of the same holy class, the wife has pro∣vided capons and rabbits; while a boiled sheep's-head and feet are produced for the husband on his unexpected return<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 67, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the dress of the common people, it continued much the same till the seventeenth century; and the fashions of the superior classes had no influence upon their humble garments. A statute informs us that shoes were commonly sold for twelve pence the pair in 1493, or about three pence sterling<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cap. 42.</NOTE>. Lindsay describes a groom's dress in 1528 as con∣sisting of a coat and hose, a cloke, and bonnet<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hist. 218. For the dress of inferior ranks few materials arise; and that of the men in particular is passed in silence by the poets, and other contempo∣raries. The coat now began to supplant the jacket.</NOTE>. To the re∣gulations of female dress, ordered by James II, and formerly recited, may be added that a farmer's wife, to receive her lover, attires herself in a kirtle or close gown of fine red cloth, a white kerchief on her head, a belt of silk adorned with silver, with a purse and keys; and two rings on each finger<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 70.</NOTE>.

<P>SO ample a description has been given of the Scotish con∣stitution, in the preceding retrospect, that little information can be added. A statute of 1493 continues to brand the go∣vernment of James III, by representing him as not only by evil counsels lavishing away the royal domains, but as receiving resignations, and granting enfeofments, in prejudice of the righteous heirs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 50.</NOTE>. In 1490 a tax having been imposed to de∣fray the expence of an embassy, it is ordered that the prelates assess the clergy: but that the sheriffs and royal bailiffs, having been often charged before by the king's letters, shall in a week produce the quotas of the barons: and the provosts and bailies of burghs shall present their portions on a short warning, under pain of imprisonment. It is added that as the lords in parlia∣ment learn that letters of discharge from the tax have been granted by the king to some prelates and peers, they are an∣nulled; "as the king could not remit the tax, it being granted by the estates to the embassador for an appointed purpose<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cap. 9.</NOTE>." The noted ordinance concerning <HI>leasing-making,</HI> or political slander, was explained not only to imply false reports to the king, con∣cerning the barons, great men, or subjects in general; but also misrepresentations to them of the conduct of their sovereign<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">1540, c. 83.</NOTE>: an important addition, and which shews that the statute was before understood only to refer to a kind of <HI>scandalum magna∣tum.</HI></P>

<P>The treasure collected by the avarice of the third James, was soon dissipated by his successor among a covetous aristo∣cracy. In 1490 a statute appears, revoking all alienations by James IV since his coronation; "so that all lands, rents, cus∣toms, burrow-rents, farms, marts, mutton, poultry, average, carriage, and other duties," then belonging to the crown may continue in their former state<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Cap. 10.</NOTE>. On the marriage of that prince to Margaret of England, her jointure is computed at two thousand pounds sterling, perhaps about twenty thousand of modern currency: in the usual proportion of one third the revenue arising from the royal domains, and the customs, might amount to sixty thousand of our pounds, exclusive of benefices, wards, marriages, and other emoluments of the crown.

<P>So slow was the progress of government in Scotland, that the valuable memoir above quoted, written about 1590, may be safely used. It is there observed that the king had no nega∣tive in parliament, but the memoirist forgets the dangerous negative before debate, secured by the institution of the lords of the articles: that most offices were hereditary even those of the sheriffs, who not only execute <HI>res judicatas</HI> as in England, but judge in civil and criminal cases: that the lords of session elected
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>their own members, and the king's recommendation was despised: that the pardon of crimes was not a peculiar prero∣gative of the crown, many peers exerting it in their hereditary judicatures: that the king cannot make peace, or war, but with the consent of the three estates: that in war the subjects only follow the king thirty days on their own provisions, and dismiss if no further conditions be stipulated; hence they pro∣tract the operations, and the nobles often rise in mutiny, having no reward nor interest in a severe and unwilling service. The writer adds that James III tore the earl of Morton's charter, because it bore a jurisdiction without any appeal to the king; but he was forced to sew it. "Among the highlanders he seemeth to have no more authority, than he can get by interest or force<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">MS. ut supra.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In this memoir the crown lands remaining at the time, are only estimated at the yearly value of five thousand pounds sterling. The exports are stated at two hundred thousand pounds; and the customs were of course small, perhaps about twenty thousand pounds, Scotish money, a year. The confisca∣tions and wardships were boldly claimed by the nobles, as soon as they fell: and while their own revenues were far too large, in proportion either to those of the king or commons, they greedily grasped at the scanty royal income, which it ought to have been their duty and honour to enlarge.</P>
<P>Lindsay in his play written about 1540, points out many reforms necessary in the government: that all the temporal lands be let in feu-farm, after the French form, or a soccage tenure free from military service: that the lords should not support robbers to oppress the poor: that a senate of justice be appointed at Elgin or Inverness, for the northern regions, as well as that at Edinburgh for the southern: that no temporal
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>suit be brought before ecclesiastic courts: that no benefices be assigned, except to learned ecclesiastics who can preach: that none shall purchase benefices either from the pope or the king: that the vicars be debarred from robbing the poor, on pretence of <HI>corse-presents,</HI> and the like: that the clergy shall reside: that except in the cases of the archbishoprics no money pass to Rome for bulls of confirmation, as neither Peter nor Paul ever drew money in that net: that priests may marry: that no barons wed the bastard daughters of the rich clergy<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Scotish Poems, 1792, Vol. II, p. 254—259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the court of James IV rather corres∣ponded with his mind, than with his revenue: and the new profession of courtier seems first to dawn in his reign. Dunbar and other contemporary poets aim their satire against this new class of men, their insignificant pretensions, their affected services, their slavish cunning and arts, their mean hypocrisy; while they really only formed a cloud to hide truth and merit from the royal eye. On the acquisition of the Hebudes, as before stated, that monarch gave a more appropriated title to his eldest son, than the diminutive style of duke of Rothsay, that of prince of Scotland and of the Isles<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Carta J. IV, 1 Jan. 1508 in Reg. as tutor of his son, JACOBI PRINCIPIS SCOTIE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T INSULARUM.</NOTE>. The latter would have been the best provincial denomination; but the change, like most others for the better, was set aside.</P>
<P>The ancient court of session, consisting of committees of parliament, if it rather sleeped during the reign of James III, was revived by his son; for in 1504 the court of daily council was created, "because there has been great confusion of sum∣monds at every session," so that leisure or opportunity would not serve to terminate them at one sitting in the year, and the poor thus wanted justice; therefore a daily council is appointed
<PB N="404" REF="410"/>to sit continually at Edinburgh, at the royal residence, or where the king shall chuse, to decide all civil causes, "and have the same power as the lords of session<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cap. 58.</NOTE>." This court continued till James V created the new court of session in 1532, as we have seen<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Keith Hist. App. 72 has published the bulls for erecting the new court of Session 1532, and levying the salaries from the ecclesiastic revenues: for which purpose, or rather to secure the king's fidelity to the papal see, 10,000 ducats a year are granted. In an account of the Scotish courts of judicature, in the time of James VI, Cal. B. V, 266—273, it is stated that the judges all sat at a long table, facing the door; the chancellor and president in the middle, facing whom were the clerks, and behind them the bar, where stood the advocates and parties. The author proceeds to say that there was no common law in Scotland; but the judges proceeded on <HI>municipal</HI> law, or the statutes of parliament, and that failing, the civil law: yet there were some usages, as succession to lands, and the like, decided by <HI>consuetude.</HI> When a senator died the king named three candidates, the ablest of whom was selected by the judges.

<P>The <HI>crowner,</HI> or coroner, continues to attract notice even in the reign of James V, with which his ancient office seems to expire.

<P>Under the year 1537 Lindsay presents an instance of the duel permitted in a case of accusation of treason. The lairds of Drumlanrig and Hempsfield were the actors; the former being near-sighted struck at random, but broke his antagonist's sword, upon which they were parted by the heralds. That writer adds that some other duels were also fought by men of the south of Scotland, on accusations of treason; but he passes them with obscure brevity<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hist. 233, 234.</NOTE>. They were probably connected with the affair of lady Glamis, and the Douglases. Dempster mentions that the duel was still used, in cases of treason, where there were no witnesses but the accuser, in his time 1623; and he specifies one of 1598 between Francis Mowbray and an Italian<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In his notes to Accoltus de bello Hierosolymitano, Florent. 1623, 4to, p. 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The state of tactics may be in great part discerned from the account of the battle of Flodden, the expeditions of John duke of Albany, and other smaller incidents and notices de∣tailed in the historical narrative. In 1491 James IV enacted
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>another statute of some length concerning <HI>weapon-schawings,</HI> or displays of armour: it is ordered that they be made four times in the year; every gentleman worth ten pounds a year in land, or more, shall have basnet, sallat (or helm without a crest,) <HI>white-hat,</HI> gorget or pisan, armour for the legs, sword, spear, and dagger: those of smaller incomes to arm accordingly. Yeomen to have bows and quivers, or an axe instead, with sword, bucklet, dagger, and spear: and burgesses in similar array: all according to their property to wear white-armour, brigantines, or jacks, with splents and gauntlets of plate-ar∣mour. Foot-ball and golf are again prohibited, that due attention may be paid to archery<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cap. 31, 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James V in 1540 ordered that every <HI>nobleman,</HI> such as earls, lords, knights, barons, and persons exceeding one hundred pounds in yearly rent, should use white, or plate, armour, light or heavy as they chuse, and weapons becoming their rank; that those of smaller income in the low-lands have a jack of plate, halbrik or brigantine, gorget or pisan with splents, knee-pans of mail, and gauntlets of plate or mail: that unlanded gen∣tlemen and yeomen have jacks of plate, halbriks, splents, sallat, or steel bonnet, with pisan, or gorget, and all to wear swords. No weapons are to be admitted at displays of armour, except spears, pikes of six elms in length, Leith axes, halbards, hand-bows and arrows, cross-bows, culverins, and two-handed swords. Burgesses are to arm in the same proportions of their income: those <HI>worth one hundred pounds in goods</HI> in white ar∣mour; those under, but who may yearly spend ten pounds, like the yeomanry<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the same parliament it was decreed that, considering the damage done to the grounds of the poor, by the multi∣titude

But the act extends not to earls, lords, barons, great-landed men, or others permitted by the king, or his lieutenant, to pass on horseback wherever the army moves<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cap. 86.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A few culverins and hagbuts were the unwieldy fire-arms, then borne by the soldiers. But the artillery was of numerous descriptions, as the reader may have observed in the preceding books. A statute of 1541 bears that, as the shot of guns, hagbuts, hand-bows, and other small artillery then commonly used, is so prejudicial to the courage of noble and valiant men, who cannot manifest their prowess except they have equal instru∣ments, it is therefore ordained that every landed man have a <HI>hagbut of founde,</HI> called a <HI>hagbut</HI> of <HI>crochert,</HI> with their <HI>calms,</HI> bullets and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellacs</HI> of lead, or iron, and a proper quantity of powder, for every hundred pound of land in the new extent: and he that has but a hundred mark land shall have two cul∣verins, while a forty pound land shall provide one culverin, with <HI>calms,</HI> lead, and powder: with trestles to be ready at all times for shooting the hagbuts. And the persons of property above specified shall provide one man, or more, to sire the hagbuts, and culverins, and teach others. The act is extended to lords of regality, and clergy: and adds that the hagbuts and culverins shall remain at their castles, abbeys, or mansions, to be kept in due order by them and their successors, for the de∣fence of the realm. And as no estimate has yet been formed
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>concerning the burghs, it is ordered that the magistrates im∣mediately prepare corresponding regulations. Ladies of con∣juct-fee, and life-rent, are to assist, in proportion to their revenues<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cap. 94. For the meaning of the obscure words Grose's history of the English army may be consulted.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Of large artillery James IV had provided a noble train, among which Lindsay mentions the seven sisters, pieces of superior size and exquisite fabric, the work of Robert Borth∣wick master of the artillery, who inscribed on his productions this rude line,

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Agriculture, Useful Arts.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief intelligence concerning these important topics still continues to be supplied by the statutes. Among the acts beneficial to agriculture, may be enumerated that permitting the king to let all his lands in feu-farm, so that it be not in diminution of the rental, <HI>grassums,</HI> or other duties, and with such clauses in the leases as may be judged proper, to remain to heirs in perpetuity; that punishing fraudulent sales of land, <HI>ex titulo oneroso,</HI> to strangers, while the heir or some friend was in prior possession; that for the plantation of woods, forests, and orchards, three acres of wood for every hundred pounds in the new extent of land; while tenants upon lease are to plant yearly for every mark-land one tree; the report against infringers to be yearly made to the sheriff, at his head-court after easter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">1504, c. 90, 1541, c. 105, 1535, c. 10.</NOTE>. A prior statute had ordained all landed propri∣etors to form parks with deer, fish-ponds, rabbit-warrens, dove-cots, orchards, hedges; and to plant at least one acre of wood, where there were no great woods nor forests<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">1504, c. 74.</NOTE>. All persons having studs of horses are to keep proper mares, and stallions of a superior size, in order to improve the breed<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">1535, c. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the prohibitory statutes of a similar tendency may be named, that ordering no multure to be extorted for flour arriving at Leith; and if adstrictions to particular milns had also been abolished the general advantage would have been
<PB N="410" REF="416"/>promoted; that regulating the rate of one boll in the <HI>chalder</HI> of bear for making malt, and compelling the malt-makers to observe proper hours of sale; that against robbers of fish-ponds, dove-cots, orchards, gardens, bee-hives; and those punishing injurers of wood, "as the wood of Scotland is utterly de∣stroyed," burners of corn, and of heath at improper seasons<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">1493, c. 44, 1504, c. 92, 69, 71, 1541, c. 118, 1535, c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a letter of 1514, lord Dacre mentioning the ravages committed by the English in Scotland, says that in an extent of twelve miles, along the river of Lid, there had been one hundred ploughs; in six miles along the Ludder forty ploughs<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cotton lib. Cal. B. II, 155, 17th May.</NOTE>; no mean idea of the state of agriculture in the southern part of Scotland, though chiefly a pastural country.</P>
<P>Concerning the useful arts the information continues equally meagre. In 1490 the fineness of gold and silver work was again regulated, and any fraud guarded against: the imposititons of drapers, and dyers of cloth is branded, the former drawing or extending the cloth, and weakening it, in order to increase the measure; the latter using perishable colours<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cap. 13; 1541, c. 112.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Sir Patrick Hamilton was in 1498 appointed governor of the castle of Blackness, with leave to build salt-pans.

What is called the golden charter of the city of Edinburgh was granted by James III, in 1482, from gratitude to the citizens for assist∣ing in his deliverance from captivity in the castle; among other privileges the magistrates are constituted perpetual sheriffs within the burgh, and appurtenances<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. passim.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> Commerce, Money, Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>In the first parliament of James IV, Oct. 1488, it was ordered that all ships, foreign or national, should only arrive at the free burroughs, such as Dunbarton, Irvin, Wigton, Kircud∣bright, Renfrew, and others; that no foreigners buy fish, ex∣cept salted and barrelled; nor any other merchandise except at free burroughs, paying their duties and customs, and taking their coquets: any commerce at the isle of Leuis is specially forbidden; and no foreigners are to freight Scotish vessels, nor the converse<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Cap. 3.</NOTE>. The meaning of this statute seems to have been to prevent contraband trade on the western coast; the eastern being replete with free burghs here unmentioned. The prohibition of navigation between the days of All Saints, and Candlemas is reinforced. In 1493 it was enacted that, as foreign vessels often eluded the customs, the masters and mer∣chants should lodge in the chief ports; and their landlords be answerable for their conduct<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">1490, c. 14, 1493, c. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some other regulations concerning commerce are repeated, and reinforced, by James V in 1535: when it was also ordered that no ship should be freighted to Flanders, except twice in the year, to the easter market and to that on the day of finding the cross, the third of May; an ordinance which only seems capriciously to fetter trade<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 31.</NOTE>. In 1542 redress was demanded from England for a ship of Aberdeen, worth 600<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Scotish
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>money in fish, cloth, and wool<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Epist. R. S. MS. Reg. 18 B. VI.</NOTE>. Many other illustrations of the state of commerce appear in the historical narrative, and need not be here recapitulated. Perhaps the most advantage∣ous was the produce of the piracy of the Bartons against the Portuguese; and the blackamoor woman, a theme of Dunbar's poetry, was probably among the novelties imported by that armed traffic<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 97.</NOTE>. Salmon continued to be a considerable export; and three or four statutes appear, during this period, concern∣ing the capture of the fish, and size of the barrels. The ex∣portation of tallow is rigorously forbidden; as the realm only furnished a sufficient quantity for its own use, little flesh being eaten by the poor<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">1490, c. 15, &amp;c. 1541, c. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Netherlands continued to be the chief seat of Scotish foreign trade: and we now find a Conservator appointed, who is to judge all disputes between the merchants of Scotland abroad, having six, or at the least four, assessors on every cause.

On the death of her husband she is rich, and courted by barons and knights<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 55, 58, 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The state of the Scotish coinage was greatly improved by James V; the gold in particular is of elegant form, and supe∣rior workmanship, so as to vie with most coins in Europe of the time. His father had, in the parliament of 1488, ordered
<PB N="414" REF="420"/>a new coinage both of gold and silver; Alexander Livingston being the chief moneyer, and James Crichton of Ruthvendaun warden of the mint<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Cap. 2.</NOTE>. The importation of bullion by the merchants, in proportion to their cargoes, was reinforced by the fame statute. In 1541 it was ordered that no premium should be taken for exchanging gold money against silver<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Cap. 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When Angus had the chief power, in the minority of James V, he issued a large groat, called the Douglas groat, if we believe Lindsay, which passed for eighteen pence Scotish, or four pence halfpenny English currency<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Hist. p. 206.</NOTE>. It has already been observed that, on the 25th Sept. 1527, Ivaizimus Heiztotter, a German, chief coiner to the king, was ordered to bring gold and silver from Germany to be coined; but the engraver of the mint was to be a Scotish artist<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Scotst.

<P>The gold of James IV is only of one size: but of his suc∣cessor there are three denominations. The groat, and half-groat, are the only silver coins: the penny, half-penny, and farthing, being in billon, or copper mixed or washed with silver. Compared with the English the Scotish money conti∣nued as one to four.

If by a general rule we multiply the prices in
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>Scotish by three, during the reigns of James IV and V, we shall nearly attain the modern sterling rate<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See Ruddiman Introd. ad Andersoni Diplomata.

<P>Under James IV the Scotish navy had attained considerable estimation; nor was it neglected by his successor.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Ecclesiastic History, Literature, Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE ecclesiastic history of Scotland, as is well known, continues a barren field, till the reformation gave it a new character, and importance. But some illustrations of the state of the clergy, and church, may not be unnecessary.</P>
<P>It may be computed that about one half of the wealth of the kingdom was in the hands of the clergy; and few there were of the order who employed it better than the peers, or preferred to the fading pomp and luxury of the day, the eternal fame of literature, and the arts. But the benefices became of course, as the reader must before have observed, an object of great attention to the government and legislation. In 1488
<PB N="416" REF="422"/>the penal statutes against the purchase of benefices, without the royal presentation, were repeated. The right of election, as in the reign of James I, was in 1493 formally restored, and probably maintained by the piety of the fourth James: and the taxation of benefices at Rome was ordered to be only to the extent of the ancient roll of Bagimont<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cap. 4, 38, 39.</NOTE>. In the following year, as the kingdom was impoverished by the exportation of money to Rome by the clergy, the practice is forbidden, under the high penalties of rebellion and treason; and in the last parliament of James V, the same punishment is extended to all intruders upon bishoprics, and abbacies, during a vacancy<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">1494, c. 53. 1541, c. 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dunbar, himself a clergyman desirous of a benefice, severely satirizes those avaricious priests who crouded pluralities upon pluralities, enjoyed all the luxuries of this life, and left the poor to God's providence, and the spiritual comforts of a future existence<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 105.

<P>The church continued militant; and several ecclesiastics were slain at the battle of Flodden.

<P>A more amiable occupation of the clergy was their preach∣ing, in the common tongue, for the instruction of all ranks. Dunbar boasts of having preached in the pulpit at Canterbury<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Scot. Poems, 1770, p. 26: he was then a preaching friar, afterwards a secular clergyman.</NOTE>;
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>and his ladies attend <HI>plays,</HI> preachings, and pilgrimages, and shew their dress in church and market; his wanton widow dis∣playing her chief artillery at church, though she pretend to pore upon her bright missal illumined with gold<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, 1, 47, 60.</NOTE>. Cavendish, the attendant of Wolsey, in his interesting life of that proud cardinal says, "he caused one of his chaplains preach the word of God to the people<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Chapt. 18.</NOTE>." In 1508 a Scotish doctor ex∣plained St. Paul's epistles at St. Paul's, as we learn from An∣dré de Tholouse: and Dr. West, the English embassador 1513, writes "when the <HI>passion</HI> was preached, and the sermon done, the queen sent for me<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Julius A.

Eight years before the reformation in Scotland, Mary was to impose high fines on those that in∣terrupted "divine service, and preaching of the word of God<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">1552, c. 17.</NOTE>;" a statute probably levelled against the bold interrup∣tions, given by the reformers to the catholic service.</P>
<P>The preaching friars had been instituted in the thirteenth century, with the intention of restoring that duty, often neg∣lected by the superior clergy, and of opposing the popular preaching of the lolards; as the jesuits were afterwards founded, in order to oppose learning to that of the protestants. In Italy itself Savonarola was to present forcible specimens of the power of pulpit eloquence: and to forfeit his life in 1498 for his op∣position to the papal abuses<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Lindsay in his Papingo, written in 1530, says

And he loudly blames the bishops for not preaching, as their predecessors did. Robert Lindsay, hist. 155, represents Patrick Lindsay a clergyman, as making an eloquent speech for lord David his brother, who exclaimed in surprize, "Verily brother, you have fine pyet words; I would not have trowed that you had such words. By St. Mary you shall have the mains of Kirkforther for it."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The Franciscan friars, of the severe order of Observantines, were highly favoured by James IV: and are often ridiculed by Dunbar, and other contemporary poets. Yet the king would, in lent especially, become a mere brother of their convent at Stirling, which he founded in 1494<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Spott. Rel. Houses, 276.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor were the vices of the monks, and nuns, spared by Dunbar and Lindsay. The abbot has a concubine, and sends his sons to the schools at Paris; he cannot preach, but excells in playing at cards, dice, or tables: the prioress is clothed in a secular kirtle of silk, under her habit; and is little guilty of chastity<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Play, ut supra, p. 243, 250.</NOTE>.

<P>The progress of the reformed doctrine will appear from the historical narrative; but some minute events may here be stated. John Knox, whose chronology is far from accurate, says that in 1494, the sixth of the reign of James IV, many persons called Lolards of Kyle were summoned before the king in council, by Blackader archbishop of Glasgow; among them were the Campbells of Cesnock and Newmilns, Read of Bar∣skomming, Shaw of Polkemac, ladies Stairs and Pokelie, Helen and Isabel Chalmers. He narrates the charges at length; and the articles are generally directed against the papal abuses. The magnanimity of James treated the affair with due con∣tempt, and it expired in a torrent of ridicule against the arch∣bishop;

<P>Soon after the execution of Patrick Hamilton, in 1528, William Arithe, a friar at Dundee, ridiculed in his sermons the vices of the ecclesiastics, and the abuse of excommunica∣tion. The priest, said he, whose duty is to pray for the people, will solemnly arise on sunday and exclaim, "Anne has lost her spindle; there is a flail stolen behind the barn; the good woman on the other side of the way has lost a horn-spoon: God's curse, and mine, I give to them that know of these goods, and restore them not<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 17. Of William Arithe, and Alexander Alane, whose book on the Authority of the Word of God, was printed abroad in 1542, 12mo, little is known.

<P>Among the learned reformers, who left Scotland in the reign of James V, Knox enumerates Alexander Allice, and John Fife, appointed professors at Leipsic; doctor Macaby or Ma∣chabeus who retired to Coppenhagen<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 21.</NOTE>. The same writer mentions that, when James returned from his noted voyage to the isles, July 1540, the clergy presented a list of the protestant peers and chiefs, that he might punish them and seize their estates; but Kirkaldy of Grange remonstrating against the malice of the ecclesiastics, the king dismissed them with this stern reprimand, "Pack ye jugglers, get ye to your charges, and reform your own lives; be not instruments of discord between my nobility and me, or I vow to God I shall reform you; not as the king of Denmark by imprisonment, nor as he of England by hanging and beheading, but yet by most severe punishments, if ever such motion proceed from you again<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 30.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>The progress of literature during this period was consider∣able. Of the poems of sir John Ross, probably a priest, Stobo, and Quintin Shaw, mentioned by their contemporary Dunbar, few reliques have yet appeared. Dunbar himself flourished in the reign of James IV, and minority of his successor; and is deservedly styled the chief of the ancient Scotish poets, his language and imagery being wonderful for the time. Nor is Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, much inferior; the great merit of his translation of Virgil yielding to the original pro∣ductions of his genius. Kennedy flourished about the year 1490; and Robert Henryson composed his apologues about the year 1500. James Inglis, denominated <HI>Sir,</HI> because he was a dig∣nified priest, secretary to queen Margaret, and afterwards abbot of Culros, was slain in 1531, as mentioned in the his∣torical department; and is celebrated by Lindsay for his ballads, farces, and plays. Kyd, Stewart, and another Stewart of Lorn, Galbreth, and Kinloch, are more known by the praise of sir David Lindsay, than by the remains of their productions. Ballenden, in his translation of Boyce's history, Edinburgh 1541, has given some tolerable poetry<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See the chronological list of the Scotish poets, in Vol. I of the maitland poems, p. xcii—c.</NOTE>. But sir David Lindsay bears the palm in the latter part of the reign of James V, by his Testament of the Papingo or Parrot, the Dream, the Elegy on the death of queen Magdalen, his Complaint to the king, Answer to the king's satire, Complaint of Bash the king's hound, Satire on long trains and veiled faces, Katie's confession, Justing of Watson and Barbour, History of squire Meldrum, and his Play or Satire on the Three Estates, first acted at Linlithgow in 1540, and afterwards at Edinburgh and Coupar in Fife in 1552. His Tragedy of Cardinal Beton,

<P>Among the writers in prose John Mair was one of the most distinguished. He was born at North Berwick, studied at Oxford and Paris; and became a professor in the Sorbonne in 1509. In 1518 he was invited to his native country by James Beton archbishop of Glasgow; and four years after followed him to St. Andrew's. He died about 1530, and probably about the eightieth year of his age. His history, though scho∣lastic and meagre, yet revived that important study, after a long and fatal silence since the year 1437, when Bowar closed his labours<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Elphinston bishop of Aberdeen, 1484—1514, only made collections, as appears from Boyce's own account in his lives of the bishops of that see.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The noted Hector Boyce, one of the most egregious histo∣rical impostors that ever appeared in any country, published his chaos of fables in 1527, six years after Major's work. But his lives of the bishops of Aberdeen, 1522, 4to, form a more pleasing specimen of his abilities<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Boyce having resided long in France, affects to spell his name <HI>Bois</HI> in his autograph, (see pres. to Hearne's Fordun:) it is surprizing he did not latinize it <HI>Sylvius.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a work indebted to his elegant epistles, Patrick Panter, secretary to James IV, must not be omitted. He was born at Montrose about 1470, studied at Paris; and gained the pre∣ferments
<PB N="422" REF="428"/>of preceptor to Alexander Stuart natural son of James, and the abbacy of Cambuskenneth. He died at Paris in 1519. By a singular fatality, David Panter, apparently his nephew, some time after succeeded to his office, and abilities; and to him we are indebted for the second volume of the royal epistles. David Panter continued in favour after the death of James V: became bishop of Ross in 1545, and died in 1558<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Praef. ad Tom. I et II, Epist. Reg. Scot.</NOTE>.</P>

Lesley bishop of Ross is said to have used this work in his history, which indeed from the year 1500 breathes most genuine and minute information; and it is probable that Abel only extracted the preceding parts from Mair, and Boyce.

<P>Ferrerius a learned foreigner, having distinguished himself by his productions on Scotish history, it would be ungrateful to refuse him a slight commemoration. He was born at <HI>Che∣rium</HI> in Piedmont, apparently Chieri near Turin, in 1502, went to Paris in 1525; where, in 1528, Robert Reid twenty-third abbot of Kinloss, returning from his ordination at Rome, found him, and brought him to Scotland, where Ferrerius remained three years at court with his patron. But desirous of returning to his studies, the Piedmontese retired to Kinloss; where he had been employed in instructing the monks for five
<PB N="423" REF="429"/>years, before he composed his history of that monastery in 1537: and especially mentions a noble library, established there by Reid, of which our author wrote a catalogue or description. In 1539 Ferrerius visited France, and published at Paris two short latin treatises on the immortality of the soul, and the superiority of the sense of hearing to that of the sight. Reid being appointed bishop of the Orkneys, he again invited Fer∣rerius in 1540, who probably met the king there on his cele∣brated voyage of that year<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Hist. monasterii de Kinloss, ordinis Cisterciensis, in Scotia, a Joanne Fer∣rerio Podemontano, ejusdem monasterii monacho.

Five years after we find him occupied in his account of the family of Gordon. His sup∣plement to Boyce appeared at Lausanne, nominally Paris, 1575, and his dedication to James Beton, second archbishop of Glasgow of that name, is dated at Paris 1574, when he was in his seventy-third year; having probably retired from Scotland at the commencement of the reformation, after a re∣sidence of between twenty and thirty years.</P>
<P>The statute concerning the education of the sons of barons, and free-holders, seems not to extend to the sons of peers, whose profession was arms and hunting, and who were to glory in their ignorance, even at the period of Sadler's noted embassy. But schools now became frequent; Henryson the poet is schoolmaster of Dunfermlin, perhaps teacher of youth in the Benedictine convent there, about the year 1500.

<P>JAMES IV improved, or enlarged, the castles of Falkland and Stirling, and founded a monastery near the latter; but that prince shewed more attachment to his navy than to archi∣tecture, and chiefly encouraged the military arts. His suc∣cessor built a palace within the castle-walls of Stirling; and another at Linlithgow, in a more advantageous situation, than the ancient edifice which was demolished<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Robert Lindsay, 229. David Lindsay in his Papingo celebrates the palace of Snawdoun or Stirling, its lofty towers, chapel royal, park and <HI>round table</HI> or place of tourney: and that of Linlithgow, equal he says to any in France. In Sept. 1529 some lands were granted to sir James Hamilton for building the pa∣laces of Linlithgow and Stirling. In 1530 Peter Scrmigeour is "master of wark." Scotst. Cal.</NOTE>. This new palace was praised by Mary of Guise, as equal to those of France; and from its remains, and those of part of the royal residences at Falkland and Holyroodhouse, the state of architecture may be estimated. Reid bishop of Orkney built the nave of the
<PB N="425" REF="433"/>church at Beaulieu in 1540<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ferrer. hist. mon. de Kinloss.</NOTE>; but few other ecclesiastic fabrics can be mentioned of this late epoch.</P>
<P>Gawin Douglas in his Palace of Honour, presents, though in an ideal description, some hints on the architecture of his time. His palace has many towers with battlements, and turrets, adorned with gilded vanes: pinnacles, <HI>fyels,</HI> winding stair-cases; gilded <HI>torres</HI> or small pillars; <HI>skarsment, reprise, corbell; fullyery</HI> borders on the buttresses, <HI>jalms,</HI> pillars, and arches<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Scotish Poems, 1792, Vol. I. p. 112.

<P>From a survey of the English borders, in the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII, it appears that the expence of build∣ing a tower was one hundred marks, of a barmekin two hun∣dred; that to Cheviot forest, then filled with red-deer and roes, the Scots repaired often to steal the alder trees, that grew by the brooks, in order to build their hovels; and that even in Tynedale, on the northern Tyne, the house of the English chief was constructed of oaken beams, yet reputed a place of strength<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Calig. B. VIII, 63—93. A curious paper.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dunbar describes a garden, as surrounded with a high hedge of hawthorn, and filled with various flowers; and the ladies sit in an arbour, under a holly tree, the native ornament of the Scotish woods, amid the melody of singing birds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 44, 45.</NOTE>. George lord Seton, 1470—1507, at great expence fitted out a ship called the Aquila, against the pirates of Dunkirk; he was a learned man, and set songs to music; he built the collegiate church or chapel of Seton in 1493; and about the same time Winton-house, to which he added a garden, the wonder of the times, "erecting about the knots of flowers five score <HI>tores</HI>
<PB N="426" REF="434"/>of timber, of two cubits high, with two knops on their heads, the one above the other, each of them as great as a <HI>rouch bouel,</HI> overgilt with gold, and their shanks painted with diverse oiled colours<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">History of the Winton family by sir Richard Maitland, written about 1560.

<P>Of painting at this period few memorials remain. A good portrait of Elphinston bishop of Aberdeen, 1484—1514, is preserved in the university there founded by him; and of James IV two curious portraits are extant<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">One is recently published in the Portraits of Illustrious Persons of Scotland, Part II. Another is in the Hamilton apartments Holyroodhouse. Pennant's Tour.</NOTE>. Yet even of James V, and illustrious persons of his reign, the portraits are uncommon, though some may lurk, neglected by a barbaric ignorance, and want of curiosity and taste, equal in their effects to the ravages of time or ferocious inroad. It is almost unne∣cessary to mention that no native painter is known to have preceded Jameson in the seventeenth century; and that the artists who visited Scotland were mostly Flemings.</P>
<P>Douglas, in his poem above quoted, seems learned in music. He mentions <HI>concords, reports, proportions duplat, triplat, di∣atesserial, sesque altera,</HI> and <HI>decupla, diapason; faburdoun, prik∣song, descant, counter, cant-organ, figuration, gemmel.</HI> The instruments are shalms, clarions, <HI>portatives,</HI> monycords, organ, tympane or drum, cymbal; cythol, psaltery<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Scot.

<P>In passing to the consideration of the state of manners, the court claims the first attention. That of James IV, if we trust the satires of Dunbar, had no great pretensions to refine∣ment: and the age was indeed a stranger to elegance, or deli∣cacy,
<PB N="427" REF="435"/>qualities ill compensated by rude magnificence. Mar∣garet the queen having ordered the poet a new doublet, James Doig keeper of her wardrobe refused to deliver it: a dance at court is described with circumstances more ludicrous, than po∣lished, and Miss Musgrave an English lady is alone applauded: the venereal disease is represented as a common malady of the courtiers, and their frivolous occupations and pretensions are ridiculed: the poet shews his claim to a benefice, and wishes that James were ruled by his queen's recommendations<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, I, 90, 94, 99, 102, 120.</NOTE>. In the account of their marriage by John Young Somerset herald, several curious particularities appear. When Margaret arrived at Newbottel, James, flying like a bird that seeks its prey, entered her chamber, and found her playing at cards: he en∣tertained her by his own performance on the claricords and lute; and at his departure leaped on his horse, a fair courser, without putting his foot in the stirrup, and spurred on at full gallop, follow who might; but hearing that Surrey was be∣hind, the king returned, and saluted the earl bare-headed. At another visit the queen gave a specimen of her skill in music, while James listened with bended knee: and on another he was attended by forty horse while he himself rode a mule. When she left Dalkeith the king met her half-way, mounted on a bay horse, trapped with gold, he and the gentlemen in his train riding as if after a hare: and an exhibition of chi∣valry took place between sir Patrick Hamilton and another knight, a lady attending one of them, and bearing his hunting horn, the other knight seized the damsel, and a conflict en∣sued till the king called <HI>peace!</HI> Of the pageants at Edin∣burgh one represented a <HI>licorn</HI> or unicorn, and a greyhound, supporting a thistle and a red rose interlaced. At the nuptial
<PB N="428" REF="436"/>dinner the first course was a boar's head gilt; but not in flames, as that at the wedding of James II. The tapestry of the chamber was figured with the Trojan story; the windows of painted glass bore, in various compartments, the arms of England and Scotland, and a thistle and rose interlaced under a crown. After supper and after dinner moralities were frequently acted, by John Inglis and his company; and the minstrels diversified the scene with music<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Young's account. Lel.

The wealth brought to his kingdom by Magdalen of France, enabled James to display considerable magnificence: "such substance was never seen in Scotland as this young queen brought into it, for there was never the like in no man's time in Scotland," says the old historian, who enumerates the liberal donations of Francis to the Scotish king and his bride: among which are ships, horses, suits of exqui∣site armour, cloths of gold, velvet, sattin, damask, taffeties and other silks; tapestries, ornaments of precious stones, and chains of gold<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Lindsay's hist. p. 247.</NOTE>. At her reception in Edinburgh the scaffolds for the pageants were painted with gold and azure; the foun∣tains poured alternately water and wine; and the dresses of the allegorical personages were of singular beauty: the crafts∣men appeared as archers clad in green, the burgesses in gowns of scarlet and <HI>granit;</HI> the lords of the session, the barons, bannerets, and peers, all in their most solemn and gorgeous attire. Nor were musicians of all kinds, heralds, and macers with silver rods, wanting to decorate the solemnity. The queen at length appeared attended by the chief ladies of Scotland: her dress dazzled the eye by the profusion of jewels; and over her the principal citizens supported a canopy of cloth of gold; while their wives and daughters chanted songs of congratula∣tion, often interrupted by shouts of <HI>Vive la Reine!</HI> The speeches of the clergy and other orators, the coronation, tournaments, and banquets enlivened by the celebrated musi∣cians of the chapel-royal, were additions to that pomp, which was so soon to terminate in the grave<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">David Lindsay, Elegy on the death of queen Magdalen.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="430" REF="438"/>But hunting rather increased in estimation; and the gran∣deur of that of James V in Athole has been already described.

In 1501 an edition of her poems was printed at Nurenberg in folio, 82 leaves, by the Celtic society, at the head of which was Conradus Celtes, (the German tongue being then believed the Celtic;) which contains six comedies, <HI>ad aemulationem Terentii;</HI> 1. Galli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anus. 2. Dulci∣cius. 3. Callimachus. 4. Abraham. 5. Paffnucius. 6. Fides et Spes. Every comedy has a wooden print, the size of the page. This edition also contains eight poetical lives of saints, and her panegyrical history of the emperor Otho I, who died in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>73.</P></NOTE>. His own Play, 1540, is a mixture of the farce and the <HI>morality.</HI></P>
<P>Stewart the poet, in an address to James V, advises him to amuse himself with hunting, hawking, and archery, justing, and chess; and not to play at cards or dice except with his mother, or the chief lords, as it was a disgrace for a prince to win from men of inferior station, and his gains at any time ought to be given to his attendants<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Scot. Poems, 1770, p. 146.</NOTE>. Scandal was, as usual, a favourite amusement at court; and poems of Henryson and Dunbar are directed against this verbal assassination<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ib. 136, 60, 62. Dunbar mentions, on the occasion, a saying of James IV, "Do well, and despise slander which spares none."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A singular letter of James IV is preserved, written in 1506 to the king of Denmark. It mentions that Antony Gawino, an earl from little Egypt, and his attendants a miserable train, had visited Scotland, by the command of the apostolic see; where having resided for some months, in a decent and catholic manner, he wished to pass to Denmark. James recommends him to his uncle's munificence; and adds that these wandering Egyptians must be better known to the Danish king than to himself, as Egypt is nearer to Denmark, and greater numbers of its people frequented that kingdom than Scotland. A cu∣rious specimen of the ignorance of the age<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Epist. Reg. Scot. MS. Reg. 13 B. II. In 1555 Mary was to enact a statute against the rural games of Robin Hood, Little John, Abbot of Unreason, and Queen of May; and against women dancing around <HI>summer-trees,</HI> or may∣poles. The Queen of May is mentioned in the poem of James I called Pebles to the Play. Her statute of 1552 against oaths by God's "blude, body, passion and wounds; Devil stick, cummer, gore, roist, or rieve them," shews the then prevalence of a stupid and disgusting fashion, now abandoned to banditti.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>That the manners of the times were not a little depraved may be learned from the tale of Dunbar, called The two married women and the widow, where the fair sex in parti∣cular shew every vice of the most polished ages, without the sentiment and delicacy. And many incidents in this history will testify that the characters are far from ideal. That luxury and civilization increase the progress of vice, will appear problematic to the student of history; and at any rate they acknowledge the divinity of virtue, by a hypocritical homage to exterior decency, while in more rude ages crimes stalk about in naked deformity.</P>
<P>In his poetical life of Squire Meldrum, Lindsay represents his hero as supping at a lady's castle in Strathern, on venison, brawn, jelly, and comfitures; with <HI>aqua vitae</HI> or brandy, wine,
<PB N="433" REF="441"/>and ale; and the table is spread with a sine cloth of <HI>dornick</HI><NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Sc. Poems, 1792, Vol. I, p. 180.</NOTE>. At this period we find <HI>bossis,</HI> or bottles, that held half a gallon each of Gascon wine; the <HI>bread of mane</HI> seems to have been enriched with spices: after a meal the table, which was only supported on temporary trestles, was <HI>closed,</HI> or laid against the wall<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Friars of Berwick, Maitland Poems, I, 71, 73.</NOTE>. The magnificence of grand entertainments may be judged of by the bills of fare which have reached our times<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See some in Arnot's hist. of Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dress of this period remains alone to be described. James IV, on meeting his bride at Dalkeith in August 1503, was clothed in a jacket of crimson velvet, bordered with cloth of gold; his <HI>lewre,</HI> apparently a kind of hood, hung behind his back; his beard was somewhat long, having in his haste forgotten to clip it close with scizzars. The visit at Newbottel presented him in a jacket of black velvet, bordered with crimson velvet, furred with white; on another he was dressed in a gown of tawney velvet, furred with black, and the collar of his sine shirt was embroidered with gold: on another, in a demi-gown of black velvet, furred with martin, and the rest of his apparel was also black. When he conveyed Margaret into Edinburgh, seated on horseback behind him, he appeared in a jacket of cloth of gold, bordered with purple velvet furred with black, a doublet of violet satin, scarlet hose, the collar of his shirt studded with precious stones and pearls, his spurs gilt and long. At the marriage he was dressed in a gown of white damask, figured with gold, and lined with farsnet, a jacket of crimson satin, with sleeves, and bordered with black velvet, under which was a doublet of cloth of gold, and his shirt was embroidered with gold thread; his hose scarlet, his bonnet black, with a rich balay or ruby, and a sword. When he ap∣peared
<PB N="434" REF="442"/>at church, two days after, his beard had been cut close with scizzars<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Young's account, Leland Coll. ut supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dress of James V is similar, except that the doublet is brought low, so as to shew a larger portion of the shirt; and the embroidered collar is transferred from the latter to the former<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Portrait in the duke of Devonshire's possession, and others.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To such minute descriptions of the male dress little can be added. Lindsay mentions <HI>brodikins,</HI> or a kind of half-boots<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Hist. 173. Boots were common.</NOTE>: russet hose, a shirt exquisitely wrought with the needle, a little bonnet, a hat high or flat, perfumed gloves, <HI>scarpens,</HI> slippers, garters knotted in a rose, a handkerchief with gold tassels at the corners, are among the ornaments of a beau<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, II, 183, 184.</NOTE>. To the winter dress belonged a cloke and hood, double shoes, and mittens or worsted gloves<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lindsay's Papingo. The hat is known as early as the reign of James I; but was generally worn only in the country, the velvet or satin bonnet being the formal dress, through all Europe: nor was it supplanted by the hat till about the year 1600. Granger I, 221, mentions a high hat with a broad brim, as occurring in a MS. of Henry the Seventh's time; after which he finds none till the days of Fox the martyrologist. Several poems of the period now under view, mention the hat as part of the Scotish female dress. A satire, Sc. P. 1770, p. 142, represents a servant wearing a cloke tied with ribbons, a thread∣bare coat bordered with velvet, and girt about his waist like a woman's gown:
<Q>His hat on syd set up for ony hest.</Q>
<P>Douglas in his Palace of Honour, describing the court of Venus, mentions among the materials of dress, cloth of gold, velvet, damask; satin crimson, striped. figured with flowers; <HI>damisflure,</HI> and others.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the dress of a lady Henryson gives an idea by mention∣ing, in a religious poem<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Garment of gude ladyis. Sc. Poems, 1770, p. 103. Lindsay's history of squire Meldrum, 184. says of a lady,
<Q>With that her kirtill was unlaissit.</Q></NOTE>, the complete attire as consisting of
<PB N="435" REF="443"/>hood, shift, kirtle (or gown and petticoat) tied with laces, and adorned with mails or spangles, an upper gown or robe purfled and furred and adorned with ribbons, a belt, a mantle or cloke in bad weather, a hat, tippet, <HI>patelet,</HI> perhaps small ruff, a ribbon about the neck, sleeves, gloves, shoes and hose. The hair was long, and plaited on what was called a head-lace<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Robert Lindsay, 201.</NOTE>. The farthingale, or small hoop, and long trains sweeping the streets, the use of veils, which had continued since the reign of James II in defiance of the legislature, and the golden chains of the ladies, are frequent objects of satire. The veil when thrown backward resembled a sail in the wind, the bosom began to be more exposed, the waist was rendered small by tight lacing, while a busk became necessary; and the gown of the belle was often raised in walking, not without coquetry to shew her hose of some wanton hue, while her mincing is likened by the old satirist to that of a bridled cat<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Maitland Poems, II, 184, 186. The Scotish farthingale, probably derived from the French or Flemings, became fashionable in England, after the union of the crowns. Its effect may be seen in lady Dalhous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e's monument in the Savoy chapel.</NOTE>.

Notvithstanding this sempill woulfulnes can not be removit out of the Kings mynd, for na persuasion nor mean. I trast verraly that God will he be punyst, be your mean, for the cruell consent of the mourdir of his fadyr.</P>
<P>Schir, the secund day of September the King send for his lords, that war nerrest about hym, and causit tham to pas in the chambre of coun∣fall; and thereafter callit Perkin to tham, and theie laid mony desiris to him, bath anent the restorance of the vii sherifdomis, the delivere of the Castell and town of Bervek, and also for the listing of the Kyngs arme, and for charges maid uponn him, and his cumpany, to bind him to pay 1<SUP>•</SUP> thousand marks within v yers after his entre.

And efter this the King past to Counsall, and tuk the lord Conquersalt, and sheu how it was all movit on the party of England; and how he had lost sa mony shippis, fa great hershippis of Cattall on the bordors. And efter this the Lord Conquersalt was bot right soft in the solistacion of this peax, and to myn appearance maid bot litill diligence herin, saying to my selff, efter I desirit him to mak diligence, it was no wounder that the Kyng was sterrit to onkyndnes.</P>

To thys yowr seyd good son, or that I myght be sufferyd ferther to procede, sent for yowr seyd letters, datyd at Hunworth the xiii day of January last passyd, interlynyd in all suche placs as the Copy of yowr seyd letter ys. In words of non importance yowr said son styketh: and also seyth these my fathers lettrs and yowr report agreyth nat. These fo∣lowyng be the wery words of my fathers lettrs. <Q>Dyuers and many “of yowr subiects, rygth gret personags, heretofore, and now of late, contrary to the perpetuall peas and amyte, have nat only interryd into thys owr reame, under couert maner, in abyts and aray dysy∣myllyd, without owr lycens or sauconduyte; but also hath often passyd and retornyd trowth the same, conveyng with them in secret maner ambassaders of certeyn princes, wych at that season war nat ”owr frends.</Q> My father wryt nat dyuers and many of my subgects, some of them beyng gret personags, and some of them in dyssymbyllyd abyts, now lattly come: but dyuers and many of my subiects, rygth gret personags, heretofore and now of late, hath passyd throwth my fathers reame, under couert maner, in habyts and aray dissymllyd. And here alsa he demandyd what gret personages other than the arche∣bysshop of Saint Andrues, and the Erle of Aren, hath passyd hertofor throwt my fathers reame without hys lycens: and what other prince's ambassadors, nat beyng my fathers frends, than the Duke of Gelders, hath been conveyd in secret maner, accordyng to the termes of my fathers letter. On to thys hys douth I have accordyng to my instruccions, and power wyt, made answer convenyant: how beyt the seyd Kyng of Scotts lenyth so fastly to his owne oppynyon, that herin in no wyse I kan satysfy hym. Wherfor I have sent to yowr grace the copy of yowr ii letters, as well to make to hys demande more ampyll answer, as to perceyue how lygtly in words of no importance he stykyth.</P>
<P>And when I seyd yowr grace toke yt some what strangly, and to hert, that yowr seyd good son shuld sey he had takyn scathe by the concludyng of the seyd amyte, the....cyrcumstans gret dependents, and possybylytes that appeared......well regardyd and consyderyd, yowr seyd good son answeryd, seyng that as tovchyng his owne person, and the marchants of his reame they had gote therby no scathe, but honor, plesure, swyfte riches, profygth and advantage. That notwith∣standyng dyuers of hys subiects, vnder the confidens of the seyd amyte, hath takyn gret scathe; wyche scathe he accomptyth nat in the losse of ther goods, but the slauthers of hys nobyll men especyally of his warden slain at a day of trew: and that no redres kan be had therof,
<PB N="447" REF="454"/>or as myche as bastard Heyron was fylyd of the seyd murder ys ufferyd to be within that yowr reame ondelyueryd. And suche scathys don thus to hys subgects he rekynygth to redovnde to hys owne person, seyng that they be always prest and redy, at all tymys and seasonys to dy and leve in hys rygthfvll service.</P>
<P>And fynally in the matters of attemptats, and redres makyng for the same, wher as yowr grace thynkyth yt nat honorabyl, ne coneve∣nyent, that princes shuld be besy or intermeddle them sylf in the redres of suche small matters: and that yowr grace woll nat encontre your good son yowr sylf nor ther wyth, but holly remyt all suche matters to ther wardens, with a streyt charge to make redres and ryghte Justace; the King of Scotts ys semblably myndyd for his parte: how be yt he thynkyth that parte of yowr wardens be nat of streyngth ne power to make convenyent redres. And wher as your Grace for ferther instruc∣tion of Justice hath comandyd the Lord Darcy to apoynt a day of mettyng, in all goodly hast, with the Lord Home, yowr seyd sone promysyth your grace that thys may be done with effect. And that by your gret wysdom at the said metyng ther be made such redres that here after no cause resonabyll to wryt to yowr grace any suche thing, ffor in thys they wyll act accordyng to your commandment make redres, he shal aduertyse yow ther off. And yowr said Son thynkyth as yowr grace dothe that princes shuld nat so lygtly esteme their amytes, that for meters of varyance betwyx ther subiects they shuld or mygth breke amytes, but redres to be made accordyngly; for lake wher of both yowr grace and he shuld then effectually put to yowr hands, nat resortyng to the letters of marke, especially in the kas of murders. For thow yt was thowth convenyent so to be don, at the fyrst makyng of the seyd amyte, yet by exsperyens sythence that tyme he se well that yf the subiects on eyther syd shuld resorte to letters of marke, yt mygth be a gret occasyon of the breche of the seyd amyte. And no thyng....more. And ther for he thynkyth yt convenyent and resonabyl, the princes be aduertysyd, yf due redres be nat made. And they so aduertysyd with owt sferther delay to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Justice exe∣cutyd accordyngly. And truly in thys matters of attemptats, murders, roberys, and spoylis, and for any thyng that I have herd, or kan per∣ceyue, yowr subiects hath iiii hurts agaynst hys one. And so have I playnly seyd: wyche I dovt nat shal duly be prouyd, at suche tyme as yt shal fortune the seyd parties to mete. The lord Home, as I per∣ceyved, ys sumewhat abashyd in thys matter; nevertheless they be so proud hertyd that in no wyse they woll confesse covardly ther errer......yowr herm to wryt to the Kyng of Scotts, menying hym that thys seyd metyng may haue no effect accordyng to his pretendyd de∣syre, ther errors ther by shal appere to ther confusyon and abayshment.</P>
<P>THYRDLY, as towchyng the Erle of Aren; thys thyng that the Kyng of Scotts takyth gretly to hert, and all the gret men of hys
<PB N="448" REF="455"/>reame; for thow so be the seyd Erle, contrary to the trete of per∣petuall peax hath interyd in to yowr reame wythowt saufconduit, and for causes by me rehersyd deservyd punyssion; yet the Kyng of Scotts seyd that herin yowr grace hath delt very unkyndly, for as myche as the doyng of the Erle was contrary to hys mynde, and other wyse than he commandyd hym. And yf ye had been hys loving father, ye shuld have sent to hym, shewyng how the Erle had dyssplesyd yow, and mysorderyd hym sylf to yowr hyghtness: and so doyng yf he had nat punyssyd hym accordyngly, or any of hys subiects had affter that yowr wryttyng atemptyd any suche lyke thyng, that yowr grace maeth have had rygth god cause to have been myscontentyd with yowr seyd good son. And when I shewyd that yowr grace was well contentyd the seyd Erle, opon hys hoth and seale to returne, shuld be at his liberte to kom to Scotlond, at hys plesure or ells wher; to thys the Kyng of Scotts seyth that yf the Erle make any suche othe or seale to retorne, he sal hang him at hys fyrst entre into Scotlond. He ys contentyd that ye put hym to hys ransom, or punyshe hym at yowr plesure other∣wyse; but now he wyl nat be content he make anye suche wrytyng or othe, for as mych as such doyng shuld redounde to hys gret rebuk and dyshonor. And also that wer contrary the trete of perpetuall peax; to hys dyshonor, he seyth that shuld be, for by thys all other persons shall thynke he hath fer mysorderyd hym sylf, to do that thyng whiche shuld cause hys father thus to intret iiii kynnysman. Thys punysh∣ment ys also contrary to the trete of perpetuall peax, for as myche as neyther of yow may punyse any vnlefull attempts done to yow, but ever to ask redres of the other. And also he kan nat se how he could, wyth owt hys assent, beyng hys subiect, retorne at yowr kallyng, seyng that none of his subiects may enter into yowr reame, withowt hys letters of recummendacion and yowr saufconduit. I kan nat by no menys induce hym to grant the seyd bonde and othe. Many of the nobyll men of this yowr sonys reame thynkyth that the seyd Erle of Aren ys kept wyth yow by hys owne menys. I perceyue that he wold very gladly that the Erle shuld kom. Howbeyt he ys steff herttyd, that he wyll nat make intercessyon for hys delyverance: how be yt my Lord of Murrey hath in the presens of the Kyng prayed me to wryt to yowr grace.</P>
<P>The ambassador of Franche, wyche hath be long with yowr grace, the Kyng of Scotts seyth sent hym word, that yf he wold wryt to hym, to dysyre yowr grace to delyver the Erle of Aren, he dowt nat but that he shuld cause hym to be delyvered. The Kyng of Scotts wolbe rygth lothe that any stranger shulde be mene betwyx yowr grace or hym. In thys thyng restyth, as I perceyue, the weyt of all.</P>
<P>Sir Patrick Hamylton hath nat ben tru in hys report: he hath shewyd to the Quene that the Erle hath ben well intretyd; and the
<PB N="449" REF="456"/>contrary he hath shewyd to the Kyng his master: and that the Erle hath made no other to retorne. The wyche reporte hath causyd the Kyng to think more unkyndnes.</P>
<P>FORTLY, as towchyng the ambassadors of the Duke of Gelders, the Kyng of Scotts seyth they wer nat conueyed throwth hys reame by his seruant; and that at ther retorne home he sent them to yowr grace. And myche he meruelyth, yf yowr grace toke dyssplesure therwyth, why ye dyd nat, wythowt fether delay, wrytt to hym, asser∣teynyng hym to haue don amys. And nat only in thys, but in all other thyngs, wherin yow supposyd hym to haue don amys. And yowr grace thus doyng he shuld have cause to thynke ye had been hys louyng father. And yf at any tyme ye had thus don, yf then he had brokyn yowr commandment, ye shuld have had resonabyll cause of dissplesure: and the Kyng of Scotts seyth, he wold nat have been miscontentyd, yf yt had fortunyd yowr hygnes to have takyn them prisoners, and intretyd them as ther ..... delt with yowr subjects.</P>

Yowr seyd sone thynkyth also that ye tak hym nat as yowr sone, nor yet trustyth hym accord∣ingly; and that yowr grace hath had mystrest, and uery ill reporte of hym, or ells ye wold neuyr have delt wyth hym so sharpley as ye have don.

<HEAD><HI>N<SUP>o</SUP> XI.</HI> Thomas Lord Dacre to the Council of England, <HI>17th</HI> May <HI>1514. Caligula B II, 155.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PLEAS it your good lordships to haue in remembrance, that at Grenewiche, in the moneth of Decembre was two yeares, where as the King of Scotts, of his malicious and untrew purposse, was aboutward to haif stollen the Town of Berwyke, My Lord Darcy wold not be Wardain of the Est and middell marchies, but upon unresonable sommes of money be hym desyred. And for because it was a momring tyme, not plainly determyned warr, but that they laye alwey in awayte of untrouthe, as is proved by the said King of Scotts, I toke upon haunde to be Wardain of the Est and middill marchies, unto the ffeast of Estre then next ensueing; and furthir of the pes continewed at our Soueraine Lords pleasure, as in thendentes therupon made more largely doth appere. At whiche tyme, in the Kyngs Inner chambre, I maide request unto your Lordships, that yf any surmyses were maide on me to the Kings grace, or you my lords of his most honorable counsaill, that noo credence shuld be taken therat, unto I had maide myn aun∣suer, whiche your Lordships did fully promyse me.</P>
<P>Now I am enformed that misreporte is maide, and put in to the Kings grace, and.....me specifieing that, inasmuche as I am war∣dainn of the Marchies, and has the hole authorite in my hands undre the Kings grace, the Scotts have and daily doth distres the Kings bordours, and subgietts, without any great hurte is done again unto them. And also that diuerse metings has bene betwixt me and the Chamberlain, of which I have not advertised the Kings grace, nor you. And over that I make not so good espiall in Scotland as I might.</P>
<P>My Lords, sens my beyng with the King's highnes at Windesore, in Decembre last passed, I neyther trysted ne mett the Chamberlain of Scotland, save oonys in ffebruary last, that I mett hym at Coklawe upon the middill marche, at the instant desire of sundry our Souveraine lords subgietts, for the ransomyng and getting to liberte their kynnes∣men and freynds, beyng presoners, lyke as I certified the Kings grace by......as apperes in oone article emongs other in my lettre, dated at Morpathe in the moneth of Marche; the copie wherof my fellowe Doctor Conyers, this berer, shall shewe unto you. Assuring your Lordships that I had non othre meting with hym, ne with non othre Scot in Scotland, for non othre matier or cause, prevely or opinly, as I woll aunswere the Kings grace, and you upon my lyf, launds, and goods. And as I shall prove at any season afore the Kings highness
<PB N="460" REF="467"/>and you, my lords, when as ye woll commande me to com to your presence.</P>
<P>My Lords, has for any intelligence, famuliarite, or kyndnesse, that is betwyxt me and the Chamberlayn, truely I know non; for in the felde of Brankston it fortuned that I, and my freynds beyng in my hoose and companye, met the erle of Huntley, and the Chamberlain, and encountred to gidders. Where as Sir John Home, Sir Will<SUP>m</SUP>. Cobkurne of Langton Knights, Cuthbert Home of Fastcastell, the son and heir of Sir John Home, the son and heir of Sir William Cok∣burn, the Son and Heir of Sir David Home, the larde of Blacater, William Carr, and thre brethren of the Bromfelds, Gentilmen, with many othur kynnesfolks, freynds, and seruaunts, of the said Chamber∣lain's, were slayne be me, and my folks; and my Broder Philip Dacre taken presoner, with many other my kynnesfolk, seruants, and tennants, taken and slayne in the said battel, as is well knowen.</P>
<P>And has for any intelligence had with any Scot in Scotland, I assure your Lordships of trouthe I haue non, as shalbe sufficiently proved; for they love me worst of any Inglisheman living, be reason that I fande the body of the King of Scotts, slayne in the felde, and therof aduertised my lord of Norfolke be my writing; and therupon I brought the Corps to Berwyke, and deliuered it to my said lord: at which tyme as I was intreated in my said lord's presence, be oone Langton of Berwyk, I reaporte me to his Lordship, and as yit it is nat punysshed.</P>
<P>And where it is thought I make not soo good espiall in Scotland, as I might doo. My Lords I assure your Lordships, that I maide the best espiall at all tymes hiddertoward, and shall maike in tyme to com, that I oder can or may unfenydly, and neithre spare for cost ne charge. And alway, as I gatt any certain matier worthy writing, I certified the Kings highnesse, or you, by post in euery behalf at lienth, as apperes more largely by the copies of the same lettres, whiche my said fellowe has to shewe your Lordships.</P>
<P>My lords, there is soo great brutilnesse, mutabilite, and instableness, in the counsaill of Scotland, that truely noo man can or may trust them, or there sayngs and devises, without it be of things concluded and determined at a parliament season, or generall counsaill of the Lords spirituall and temporall. Of whiche determined mynds and purposes, from tyme to tyme, as often as they have sittin, and as fere as I couthe gitt knowlege be myn espies, or otherwise, I certified the Kings grace or you, as is aforewrittin.</P>
<P>To have daily acombred the Kings grace, or you, in sending up writings be pooftis of tryffills, and flieng tailes of noo certanty, like as I suppose other has done, to no litell cost and charges of the Kings grace, I wold have bene loth to have done.</P>
<PB N="461" REF="468"/>
<P>And as unto the distruccion of the King's bordours and subgietts, without any great hunte done again unto them, Right harde and im∣possible it is for suche a poure Baron as I am, to make resistence and kepe the Kings subgietts and there goods in suretie, all along the Est, middill, and West Marchies, against the hole power of the Realme of Scotland, without great help and assistance; where as in tymes passed the Duke of Gloucestre, beyng a Kyngs Broder, and therll of Northumbrelond, with there great powers, couth not well kept them, but ever distroyed. And as my Lord of Norfolk and my Lord of Winchestre knowes that, in the last werr, when as they both laye upon the Est bordours, with the ayde and assistence of the hole marchies; what busines and payne they toke on them, and had, I doubt not they can reaporte. And over that I doubt not but your Lordships remembreth, that at my said beyng with you, I shewed you that I had no strienth ne help of men, freynds, ne tennants, within the same Est Marchies, that wold ayde and assist me to serue the Kings grace; fforasmiche as Berwyke, Bamburghshyre, and Dunstanceburghe, with Sir Roger Grey power, is in my lord Darcy haunds and reull. Alawyke and Werkworthe, belonging to my lord of Northumberland; Elandshyre, Norhamshire, and the Greys launds, belonging my Lord or Duresme, and William Heron of Furde, now belonging to my lorde of Northumberlond, with all oder Gentilmeynys launds, and men, whiche lyes upon the said Est Marchies, woll noder ryde ne goo, ne non of them doo seruice for me, ne at my commandment in the Kings name, and your's. The inhabitants whereof gyffs me the hole blame that the King's grace sends down noo soldiours to the said bordours; ne wages to them to make resistence or invasion, without whiche they said to me they couth doo no service, like as my writing purporteth. And like as I shewed your Lordships be mouthe, wages gevin to the inhabitants there were in manner waisted and lost.</P>
<P>And as to the destruccion of the same Est Marchies, sens my said beyng with hys highnes last, I assure your Lordships there is not iiii<SUP>xx</SUP> howsis, and cotags burnt, which by estimacion exceds not the some and value of xl li. at the vttermost. At whiche tyme your Lordships shewed me that oder shuld my Lord Darcy come downe to be wardain of the said Est Marchies with diligence, and defend the same, or els the Kings grace and you wold provide for som other person to come downe, and be wardain; for whom I loked, and daily lokes: and the most substance of the said Matchies is sawne to the frountours of the bordour.</P>
<P>And as unto the state of the West and Middill Marchies, beyng drye bordours from Bownes to Hangingstane, conteignyng l. Myles in lienth, as the bordours goeth, where as euery person of horsbak or foote may ryde and enter at there pleasures. I haue soo endeavored me during this warr tyme that there is litell harme done to oder of
<PB N="462" REF="469"/>them, neither in burnyng, spoling of goods, ne otherwise; but ar fully plenysshed to the verey bordour, in as large maner as ever they were the daies of my lyffe, both in housing, sawing, and pasture. And as yit there is not burnt xx howsys within both the same Marchies, as I woll aunsuer the King's grace and you. Whiche is a metely good bounds in lienth for siche a man as me to gouerne, reull, and kepe in fauetie, during this warr tyme without any chargies of the Kings grace.</P>
<P>And for oone cattell taken by the Scotts, we have takyn, won, and brought away, out of Scotland c<SUP>th</SUP>; and for oone shepe, cc<SUP>th</SUP> of a suretie. And has for Townships and housis, burnt in any of the said Est, Middill, and West Marchies, within my reull, fro the begynnyng of this warr unto this daye, aswell when as the late King of Scotts laye in the same Est Marchies, as at all othre tymes, I assure your Lordships for trouthe that I have, and has caused to be, burnt and distroyed sex tymes moo Townys and howfys, within the West and Middill Marchies of Scotland, in the same season then is done to us, as I may be trusted and as I shall evidently prove.</P>
<P>For the watter of Liddall, beyng xii myles of Lienth, within the Middill Marche of Scotland, whereupon was c<SUP>th</SUP> pleughes; the Watter of Ludder in the same Marchies, beyng vi myles of Lienth, wherupon was xl pleughes; The two Townys of Carlangriggs, with the demaynes of the same, wherupon was xl pleughes; The Watter of Ewse beyng viii myles of Lienth in the said Marchies, wherupon was vii<SUP>xx</SUP> pleughes; The hede of the Watter of Tevyote, from Branksholme up unto Ewse Doores, within the same Marche, beyng viii myles in lienth, wher∣upon was iiij<SUP>xx</SUP> pleughes; The Watter of Borthuike within the same Marche, beyng in lienth viii myles, that is to sey from Borthwyke mouthe to Craikecrosse, wherupon was c<SUP>th</SUP> pleughes; and the Watter of Ale fro Askrige to Elmartour in the said Middilmarchies, wherupon was L. pleughes; lyes all, and euery of them, waist now, and noo corne sawne upon none of the said grounds. Whiche grounds is over and besyde the great Rode that I made in the said Middill marche, upon Martilmas day last past, the contents wherof I wrote to the Kings grace by pooft.</P>
<P>And upon the West Marchies of Scotland, I haif burnt and distroyed the townshipps of Annand, Dronok, Dronokwod, Tordoff, Fyshe∣gewghe, Stokes, Eftrige, Ryelande, Blawetwood, Foulsyke, Westhill, Berghe, Rigge, Stapilton, Wodhall, Raynpatrike, Woddishill, Over∣brotts, Nethirbrotts, Elistrige, Caluerttfholme, Beltemmount, Hole, Kirkpatrike, Hyrdhill, Mossesyde, Stakehughe, Brome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olme, Walg∣hopp, Walghopdale, Baggraye, Murtholme, Langhane, Grymesley, and the Watter of Esk, fro Stabulgorton downe to Cannonby, beyng vi myle in lienth.

<P>MY Lord Dakare, I command me hartly to you: and vyt ye, that I have resayved your vryteng, and sene the artikles, and ondarstandys them at length. Vysche ar ryght scharpe, and specyaly at the end∣yng of them, vharein, in a part, I have schawn my mynde at length to thys berar, be cause it var owr longe to vryt; bot in part I vol make you answar in this my vryteng.</P>
<P>My Lord, as to me to send to the King's Grace, my brothar, for my matars, befoor the takyng of the pees betwxt the Kyngs Grace my brothar, and thys rawlme, ane that my matars may be sen for, and that I may be answard and obayd of my lyfeng in that pownt, I shal send a sarvand of myne declaryng the weryte, how I have bene intretyd sen my last comyng into Scotland. Vysche I have vryten of befoor at length to the King's Grace my brother, and to you; howbeyt I gat no remedy. And the last pees that vase takyn, vas done vythowt me, or ony way made for me; bot a general fayr vord, vysche dyd me lytel profet. For thys raulme vol set lytel be me, gyse thay may get the pees vythowt me, or my request: vysche it is more with the Kyng's Grace honowr to do it for my sake, and at my reqwest, con∣syderyng I am modar to the Kyng of thys rawlme.</P>
<P>Allso, my Lord, I com at the desyre of the Kyng's Grace my brothar, sent to me be frear Henry Jedward, vische sayd mony good vordys to me, on the Kyng my brothar commandment, and that thare schuld not no pees takyn bot at my reqwest. And mare I com to my Lord of Angus, aigaynst all the Lordys of Scotlandys vollys, trastyng to have had helpe of the Kyng's Grace my brother, to have borne forth my good qwarele; for it vas owr nyche tame to stryfe agaynss all the rawlme, consyderyn how it standys betwixt my Lord of Angus and the Lordys, and they not agreed.</P>
<P>My Lord, as to my Lord of Angus, gyf he had desyrd my com∣pany, or my loff, he vald have schawn hym moore kyndly than he hath don. For now of layt, whan I com to Edynbrowch to hym, he toke my howces vyth owt my consent, and vythhaldyd my lyfeng fre me; vysche he schuld not do of reson: nor that is not the vay to desyre my good vol. And I to have takyn both gret dysplesur of Scotland, and trobyl, and had no helpe of the Kyngs Grace my brother, nor no lus of my Lord of Angus, and he to take my lyfeng at hys plesur, and dyspon it, me thynke, my Lord, ye schuld not thynke thys resonabyl, gyfe ye be my frynde, as I trast ye be.</P>
<PB N="470" REF="477"/>
<P>My Lord ye remembar, at my comyng to Edynbrow, I dyd vryt at length to you, how the Lordys of Scotland dyd to my Lord of Anguss; and that vythowt I had gotyn helpe of the Kyngs Grace my Brother, I might not bere owt owr port; for on the on syde the Vestland Lords and my Lord of Anguss vas forth; and the tothar Lordys vass rycht scharpe apon hym. And I desyrd to know vhat helpe I myght troste to, and ye vrot to me agayn bot lychtly, that the Kyng my Brother vald do for me, in general vordis, bot it most be the dede that vyl helpe me.</P>
<P>My Lord, as to the tothar pownt, that I bere soo good mynde to the Dwke of Albany, as ye say; and that he gyfes me bot fayr wordys, to put the blame of hym, that I am not answard of my lyffeng.</P>
<P>My Lord, as to that pounct, I beleffe not hys fayr vordys, bot as he hath don to me in dede; var not the kyndnes that he hath schawne to me, both of hys awne mwnne gyfen to me, and causyd the Lordys to furnych me of the redyest of the Kyng my soon's, I vold haf bene constrayned to haf put avay my Jowels, an Coburd; and thys I dyd vryt to you befoor. My Lord, I trost the Kyng's Grace, my brothar, vol consydar me as I that am hys systar: that I moste bere good mynde vhare I fynd good ded: for as I fynd I most schaw. And I trost hys Grace vol lofe hym the betar, that he doth for me. And I can not porsafe bot that the Dwke of Albany may doo the Kyng's Grace, my Brother, as mosche sted in thys rawlme, and moore than ony othar: vysche I knaw vel his Grace may have ony vay that he plesys of hym.</P>
<P>Also, my Lord, vhare that ye speke of the kypeng of the Kyng my soon, and that the Lordys that ar abowht hym is of the Dwkys putyng; my Lord, it is knawn contrary that the Lordys put them abowt the Kyng my soon. And I vayt viel thay losse the Kyng my soon, as viell as ony in thys rawlme. And thay var put to hym or I com last in Scotland, as ye know. As for other pwntys, partanyng to the Duke, lat hym answar for hymselfe: bot as for the Erldom of Marche, he makes me no trobyl as yet.</P>
<P>My Lord Dakars, ye schuld not gyfe so lychtly kreden to ewel talys of me, as ye doo, vhol ye knu the trowth, sopos ye bere gret favor to my Lord of Anguss, as I se ye doo; howbeit I have sene it alss far otharvays. I most cast me to ples thys rawlme, sen I have my lyfeng here, and few fryndys but throw my good beryng. Vharefor thay schal have no cause of reson to holde my lyfeng fra me: and I thynke the Kyng's Grace schuld helpe me the betor. Also whare ye say that I com owt of Edynbrow, in the nyght; that vas not: for all the Lordys knu of my comyng avay; and I saw no good for me to byde apon thare.</P>
<PB N="471" REF="478"/>
<P>And vhare ye say that I am rewlyd be the cownsel, that vol never do me good, nor honowr; my Lord, I dyd never dyshonor to myself, nor them that I am com of: nor me thynke ye schuld not kyfe credens to that of me, both for the Kyng's Grace my brother's sake, and the Kyng my father, who sowl God pardon. And I have made you betar cause, nor my Lord of Anguss hath don, or ony of hys. Bot I knaw vel the Byschope of Dwnkeld consel, vhen he vass vyth yow now latly; vische hath causyd you to vryt so scharply.</P>
<P>And as towchyng to Syr James Hamylton, I myght not lat hym to ryd on the vay; bot he convoyd me not. It wass othar Lordys that browght me to Lytgo, as hys known.</P>
<P>My Lord, allso ye vryt ryght scharply to me, in your last Artykel, sayeng that I do dyshonor to myselfe, that bydyth from my Lord of Anguss; and that I folow them that vol be my distrokcyon, and can not stand vyth the plesur of the Kyng's Grace my Brothar; and that I may not loke for ony fawor at the Kyng's Grace my Brothars hand, for it is thowt that I am sair abusyd, oundar collour of fayr promysses, vysche schuld bryng me to the dysplesur of God, and my dysshonor, and ondoyng, at length.</P>
<P>My Lord, thys is soor vordys, and onkyndly. If thys be the Kyng my Brothars mynde, I being hys systar, that ewel and falsse folke schal make syche raport of me, and so lyghtly kredence to be gyffen to the sam, it is ryght heffy to me; and I may thynke it strancge that my Lord of Anguss may make the Kyng my Brothar so dysplesyd at me, wythout ony fawt makyng, as schal be viel known. Vharefor it is no marwel sopos othars be onkyndly, consyderyng that I toke my Lord of Anguss, agaynst all Scotland's vyl, and dod hym the honowr that I coud: vhare throw I losst the kypeng of my soone, my hows of Styrlyng, my rewl of the rawlm, vysche I had be ryght, that myght not have bene takyn from me: and all thys for hys sake. And now hymselfe hath schawne hym as onkyndly to me as is posybyl, vysche all the rawlme knaws; haldyn my lyfeng from me, as far as he may: and abof all thyng he spake opynly dyshonor of me, wysche is no tokyn of lofe; and I dyd nothar dysplesur, nor dyshonor, to hym, as is viel kend.</P>
<P>My Lord, thys not a good vay that suld cause me to com to my Lord of Anguss; sen I toke hym at myne awne plesur, I vol not be bostyd to take hym now. And thus I moste do the best I may to get my fryndes, sen hys Grace, that I trosstyd most in, may be put by me, vythowt faut; vysche I schal never make to hys Grace, as I schal vryt at length to hym vyth a sarvand of myne.</P>
<P>My Lord, I vold have trostyd that ye vold erar have helpyd me at the Kyng's Grace my brother's hand, than to have hyndard me. Ye

<P>PLEAS it your Grace to be aduertised, that in my laste lettres, amonggs other thinggs, I wrote unto your said Grace, declaring as thenne myne oppynnyon was what damage and daunger was likly to ensewe to therle of Angwisshe, and howe there was noon assuraunce to be nooted in therle of Arren. It mooved me soe to write, by cause the said Erle of Arren being afore an extreme enemy to therle of An∣guisshe, was newly reconciled: and also his proceedinggs afore in many causes have not gretely been to be nooted to his honor. Howe be it, as every thing hath commen to passe, his acts nowe doe shewe the true effecte and experience of his parte, booth towardes his prince, and his kynnesman therle of Anguisshe. By reason whereof, after my poor oppynnyon, ther is suche a knot knytte betwene the saide twoe Erles, considering they were thoroughly accoorded of late, for the dedely ffede that was betwene thaym for the deth of Sir Patrick Hamylton, that I see noe way howe the said knotte shulde nowe be dissolved by any grete personnage in Scottelande: oonles it shulde be by the compasing of tharchebusshop of Saint Andrewes, whose practises at this tyme have commen to the deth and distruction of his kynnesmen, and nigh frendes: and as I am infourmed to his noe litle perell and daungier at this tyme.</P>
<P>Thabbotts of Melrose and Domfarmeling booth, breder, and Nephewes to the said Archebusshop be slayn; as is a grete frende and Counsailor of his, the lorde of Kere, Capitaine of Starling; with many other his kinnesmen, and servants. Soe that douteful it is howe the said Archebusshop shall compase and convey for his partie; for I canne not noote any oon parson in Scotteland, nowe that therle of Lenneux is slayn, and the other taken, that is able or woll encounter with the Erles of Anguisshe and Arren; whose powers and strengthes extende from the Brigge of Starling to theste and myddle marches. And as the case standeth, ther be many friends conformed with thair favors, and devocion to the said Erle of Anguisshe. So that nowe, after my poor mynde, good it shulde be, that the young king shulde be counsailed to avoid all symple and synister counsaill, and to lean with his good and gracious favors to the oppynnyons of the said twoe Erles, being the gretteste men of power and frendeship in all Scottelande, and mooste meete to doe unto his said grace true and faithfull serves, notwith∣standing any letters written by his grace ayenst therle of Anguisshe to the contrary.</P>
<PB N="477" REF="484"/>
<P>Mencion is made that James Stewarde, and William Stewarde, breder to the Lorde Evendale, be booth slayn. Thay were speciall servants to the Quene's grace, and breder to Harry Stewarde that attendeth upon her said grace.</P>
<P>I humbly beseche your said grace to pardon me of this my writing; it is but oonly to make playn some parte of the letter, sent unto me from Sir Christopher Dacre, and to shewe my poorest oppynnyon as I conceive, concernyng the affaires and causes of Scottelande.</P>
<P>Hit pleased your grace, at my departing frome the same, to com∣maunde me to write to my Lorde of Combrelande, shewing that your grace desired his Lordship to be good to Sir Christopher Dacre, touchinge a ffarmehoolde in those parts. I wroote to my said Lorde as effectually as I couth; and declared howe thankfully his doing for the said Sir Christofer shulde be accept by your said grace; but as it appereth by the said Sir Christofers letter there commeth noon effecte of my writing.</P>
<P>Contynually I call and labor for the reformacion of the grete charge of this houshoolde, and to reduce the same to be orderd according to the Revenues, wherynne I have some busynes, nevertheles I shall ap∣plye me as well as I canne to youre gracious commaundement.

The Quene lyes in the Chambre where that the Duke laye; and the King lyes in the Chambre above her; all in a lodgeng.

<P>The Larde of Bukcleugh has a respecte, and not forfeite; and will get his pece, and was in Lithqno both Sondaye, Mondaye, and Tewis∣daye last, whiche is grete displeasure to the Carres.</P>
<P>The Busshop of Sancte Androwes and they ar wele agreed: and so he may com to the Courte and he will: but he will not com there unto he see the Courte changed of another fashone. The said Busshop has releessed and geven to therle of Arrain the Abbey of Kilwynnyng; and so the said Erle is gone to entre, and take deliverance of the same. He has geven to th'erle of Angussh two thousand marcs Scotts; to George Douglas a thousand marcs Scotis; to Archibald Douglas a thousand marcs Scotis; and he has also geven to Sir James Hamylton a thousand mares Scotis.</P>
<P>The Abbot of Arboroeth, whiche is Kynnesman to the Busshop of Saint Androwes, has lyne all this Parliament tyme in Edinburghe, for the fulfilling of this aggreament.</P>
<P>Drurye, a monke of Minouse Abbey, has gotten the bulles of the same Abbey at Rome, and caused them to be proclamed; whiche has done grete displeasure to my Lorde Maxwell, for it will put his broder from the same by all likely hede, notwithstanding the King and the Lordes at this Parliament has inacted that no Scotisman shall purchase no benefice at the Poppes hande, except that they have licence of the King, and the Lordes of the Counsail.</P>

<P>It is thought, and oppenlye spoken all this parliament tyme, that if the Quene do remane with the King, that the Courte wil have a tourne; for the King has noon affection, nowder to th'erle of Angussh, nor therle of Arrain.</P>

<P>PLEAS it your Grace to be advertised that, sens my repare in these North parties, and upon the knowlege had of the subdeigne excharge of th'affairs of Scotland, I sent a servant of myne to Edinburghe; who laye ther the space of x dayes, and cam hidder this daye to me. He sheweth me that the King and Quene cam frome Sterling to Edin∣burghe, upon Mondaye the vi daye of this Moneth, accompanied with the Bisshops of Glaskew, Abirdene, Dunkeld, Gallowaye, and Brighen; togidders with th'erles of Argile, Arren, Ecclington, Rothuse, and Bothwile. And also the Lordes Maxwell, Avendale, Seton, Forbos, Home, and Yestre, with their servaunts, to the number of CCC. Speres. And in the Bushop of St. Andros loegeing the King remaigned tewisdaye, wednisdaye. And upon Thuresdaye following ther was pro∣clamation made, in the King's name, that no writing, messangers, or Messages, shuld by any parson be sent unto th'erle of Angwis, his two bretherne, or Uncle. And that none appartaignyng unto any of theim shuld be found in the towne, or precinct of the same, from iiii of the clock aftarnoon furth, upon paine of deth. Upon the Sattur∣daye, and Mondaye following, the King and the foresaid Lordes satt in the tolbooth; where as thaye determyned to have a parliament, and the same to begynne in Edinburghe on Wednesdaye the ii<SUP>d</SUP>* daye of September. Thaye have autorized the Bushop of Glaskew, late the Kings Schoolmaister, to be Chaunceller of Scotland: the Lord Max∣well to be Provest of Edenburghe. The King and Lordes of Coun∣saill haith sent writings at this tyme unto the King's Highnes, and your Grace, with Patrik Sincler. The King is reuled and advised by the Quene, Henry Stieward now her Husband, the Lord Maxwell, and the Lard of Buccleugh, cheif mantener of all misguyded men on the borders of Scotland; togidders with the shireff of Ayre, that slew therle of Cassils, and now bedsello to the said King; with suche lyk oder murderers, and mysguyded personnes, whiche are now best che∣ryshed, and most in favours with the sayd Kyng and Quene. I see no liklyhode or appearaunce of any staye, or good order, to be had within Scotlaund, for the causes aforesaid. Therfore I besiche your Grace that I maye knowe the pleasour of the King's Highness, and your Grace, as I shall ordour me, for as muche as many henyous offences ar commytted upon the bordours of both sides, and thofficers that was, or now is, deputed for the partie of Scotlaund, neithir made, or

As∣suring your Grace all the tyme the King was in Edinburgh, he was nightlie watched with sundrye Lordes, in their moste defensible arraye: and one night the King watched hymself, in like arraye, for fere of therle of Angwys and his partie. Upon tewesdaye last the said King and Quene removed to Sterling; and the Lordes roode to their owne countreys, leving Edinburghe, and the Countrey adjacent, in disorder.

<P>PLEASITH it youre good Grace, according to your Comaunde∣ment, to be advertysed of the newes of theis parts, syns my last lettres unto the same. The Kyng of Scotts, the II<SUP>d•</SUP> day of this present month of October, in hys owne person, with the nombre of D men, came to the Abbey of Coldyngham: afore whose commynge the Erle of Angwyshe brother, whoo was Prior ther, was deperted to the mercy of God, and ther thought to have takyn the said Erle; but he havyng prevey warnyng of the Kyngs malicyus purpose, did hove, with CC men, within a myle of the Kynge. And at the said Kyngs comynge thyther, he put the Lord Home, and his brother the Abbot of Gedworth, in the said hous of Coldyngham: and ther lest theyme to kepe it, return∣yng agayn homeward. At which returne the said Erle of Angwysshe pursued the Kyng soo fast, that he drove hym to Dunbar.</P>
<P>And alsoo the said Erle expulsed the Lord Hoome, and his brothir, owte of Coldyngham; and ther now doth remayne hymself, as more at length your Grace may perceyve by the Erlis lettres sent unto me the which letter I send unto your Grace herein closed. And nowe the said Erle haith sent unto your Grace's Castell of Norham the Laidy Margaret his doughter, which he had by the Queen; whoo ther doth remayne unto such tyme I may knawe furder of your Grace's pleasure.</P>
<P>And for the said Erle, I can see non other but that, of very necessite, he shal be dryven unto this Realme for sucker, by reason of the great army that the Kynge doth rayse against the xviii<SUP>th</SUP> day of this month, only to put and expulse owte of his Realme the said Erle: whoo in lykewyse haith wryten unto me to aide hym. To which no furder than I have wryten unto your Grace by my former letters, I will pro∣cede anends the saide Erle, unto such tyme as I may knaw the Kyngs Hyghnes's pleasure, and youre Grace's: the which to solowe, accord∣inge unto my most bounden dutye, I shall indevour myself, to the uttermost of my power.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding nowe, whan the said Erle of Angwyshe dyd set apon the Kynge of Scotts, it was in the nyght, at which tyme many Scottsmen, and, as I am very credably informed, dyverse of the borders of England, came unto the said Erle in the nyght; the which dar not resort unto hym in the day. Soo that he was D men, apon the nyght whan he chassed the Kynge.</P>
<P>And for Justis of the Borders, here is none kept of the Scotts party, nor noo rediesse maid: for of late the Scotts have been in, on the

<P>And for the Contrey of Northumberland, for theft done for ony Inglyshe men, I suppose was never in such stay as it is nowe; and noo crymes now comytted, nowther by Gentlemen, ner non other, contrary to the Lawes of the Wardenry, and Justs, but they be sharply corrected. Sayff, to the perlus example of all the Contrey, Syr Wil∣liam Ellycar haith, without licence, bene in the Realme of Scotland, and also brought in with hym Mark Carre, and other Scottsmen, to the Kyngs Castel of Werk; and ther hunted openly with the Scotts men in Ingland. The which march tresons, by caus he is the Kyngs Servant, I durst not procede unto, without the Kyngs plesure knawen, and your Graces; the which in the premisses most humble I besech the same I may knaw: and that it may like your good Grace to gyf credence unto my felowe Lenard Musgrave, this beirer, whoo purposely I send up unto you, to informe youre Grace of thes occurraunces at lenth.</P>

<P>RYGHT honorable, and my especiall good lorde, I commend my service to youre Lordshyp. Certefying the same that, sen I landyd in Fraunce, I was not oon daye unridding. I have ben at Hartflowe, and at the New Haven. I bare Gawyn's charges, and tooke hym with me, to that entent that I shuld kepe my selfe close, and cause hym to bryng your frends to me, bothe for yowr welth and ther's. He went to the man that I was specially send to. He was glad of my comyng, bot he cowde not cum to me; nor he wold not that I shuld have cumyd to hym. The king sende to hym a letter chargyng hym, in payn of hys hed, he should not departe from the Sheppe ii pare of buttelenghtes, nor yet lye owt of her, wher all hys treasure and rayment laye. Not with stondynge he is youre faythfull frend. Nor, as I am informed, ye have not a foo with the Kyng at thys tyme, save the Erle of Argyle. John of Bartoun com lovingly to me in Hartflowe, and shewed to me many good tydyngs. Sir James Hammylton is evell reported of to the Kyng of many; and the Kyng haith sworn to have amends of hym; in so myche the King hym selfe sayd, upon the see, to John of Drummond, If I wold bot oons luke merely upon the Erle of Anguss, Sir James wold drowppe; for by the wondes of God, sayd the Kyng, for all Sir James bragyng, the Erle of Anguss and he never mett, bot Sir James torned euer the bak semes of his hoose. After poyntments and wayes made with your frends, I returned again to Rowen; wher, that same nyght, I harde an inclyn of a poyntment betwen the Fraunce Kyng and the Kyng of Scotts. Wherefore on the morning I was styryng betyme, and postyd to Parys to know the truthe of every thyng. A legge a yysid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sic: probably <HI>ayond,</HI> beyond.</NOTE> Ponttoyes I mette with my Lorde Askyne and the Abbot of Couper, makyng haste to the New Haven to passe in Scotland, in oon of the Kyng Sheppes, to receave Dumbar to the Kyng of Scotts use, with all the Implements thereof.

Ther mariage shall be in Parys, with great tryumphys.

The Kyng ys mych mayd of with the Fraunce, and put in the same order that the Dolfynne had, with all the Dolfyns servands
<PB N="493" REF="500"/>wayttyng upon hym. It was shewyd to me, of a sage merchante of France, that their ii Kyngs wold have the Kyng of Englond with them thys wynter. The Kyng of Englond can desyre nothyng rea∣sonable of the Fraunche Kyng, but he shall opteyn it, he loves hym so well. Wherefore if ever ye looke to have the favor of the Kyng of Scotts, othir now or never plye your busyness; and breke the matter to the Kyng of Englond your mayster, for he maye opteyn at thys tyme of the Fraunce Kyng what he will desyre. And I am sure the Kyng of Scotts wyll denye nothyng, that the Fraunce Kyng wyll desyre hym with. In the mean whyle (God wyllyng) I shall so labor with your frends, that the Kyngs malice shall be sumwhat abatyd. Lyberton ys kynde after the olde fation, with many more, if they durste expresse it. Me think it best that ye shuld so solicyt the Kyng's moste affectuall letters, that they shuld be with the Fraunce Kyng before the daye of mariage; the which shall be upon Sanct Katheryns Daye, if all promyses be kept. Ys you wyll have me to do ought els, instructe me wyth your wryttyngs, the which I loke every daye for. Cause the wryttyngs ye shall send to me to be de∣lyvyred in Depe, to George Howm. Thys ys the thyrde letter that I have wrytten to your Lordshyp, sens I com in Fraunce; the which letter I pray God maye sone com to your hands, both for your welth and my discharge. I entend to seke up to the courte for more kno∣lege; but thys ys trew that I wryte to yow. Other yow shall opteyn the Kyng of Scotts favor, if the Kyng of Englond wyll shew hym selfe your good mayster, as your truste ys in hym, or the Kyng of Scotts com owt of Fraunce; or els we shall never sew for hys favor and good wyll hereafter.

<LETTER>
<P>PLEAS it your goode Lordshipe to be advertisede, that at the meat∣ing which I had with twoe gentle men of the King of Scotts' Coun∣saile, at Caldestreme, for suche buysynes as I have advertised your Lordshipe of, in myn other letter, what of our precedings in the same, I haide diverse comynyngs with Sir Thomas Bellendyn, one of the said Counsaillors for Scotlande, a man by estymacyon apperaunte to be of th age of fiftye years, or above, and of gentle and sage conversacion, specially touching the staye of the Spiritualtie in Scotlande. And gathering him to be a man inclyned to the soorte used in our Sovereigns Realme of England, I dide soe largely breke with hym in those be∣halves, as to move to knowe of him of whate mynde the King and Counsail of Scotlande was inclyned unto, concerning the Busshope of Rome; and for the reformacion of the misusing of the Spiritualtie in Scotlande. Whereunto he gentlie and lovinglie answerede, shewing hym self well contented of that comynyng, did saye that the King of Scotts hym self, with all his temporall Counsaile, was gretely geven to the reformacion of the mysdemeanours of Busshops, Religious per∣sones, and priests, within the Realme. And so muche that by the King's pleasure, he being prevey therunto, thay have hade ane enter∣luyde played, in the feaste of the Epiphane of our Lorde laste paste, befor the King and Quene at Lightgwe, and the hoole counsaile spiri∣tuall and temporall. The hoole matier whereof concluded upon the declaration of the noughtiness in Religion; the presumpcion of busshops; the collusion of the spirituall Courts, called the Consistory Courts in Scotlande; and mysusing of preists. I have obteigned a noote from a Scotts man of our soorte, being present at the playing of the said Enterluyde, of theffecte thereof, which I doe sende unto your Lordshipe by this berer. My Lorde, the same Mr. Bellenden shewed me that, after the saide Enterluyde fynished, the King of Scotts dide call upon the Busshope of Glascoe being chancellor, and diverse other Busshops, exorting thaym to reforme their facions and maners of lyving; saying that oneles thay soe did, he wold send sex of the proudeste of thaym unto his uncle of Englande; and as thoes wer ordored, soe he wold order all the reste, that wold not amende. And therunto the Chancellor shuld aunsuer, and saye unto the King, that one worde of his gracs mouthe shuld suffice thayme to be at com∣maundement. And the King haistely and angrely annsuerd, that he wold gladely bestowe any words of his mouthe that could amend thaym.
<PB N="495" REF="502"/>I am also advertised by the same Mr. Bellyndyn, that the King of Scotts is fully mynded to expell all spirituall men from having any auctorite by office under his Grace, either in household or ells where within the Realme; and dailye studieth and devisethe for that entente. The same Mr. Bellendyne, haithe desired of me, to haue an abstract of all suche acts, constitucions, and proclamacions, as ar passed within this the King our Soveraign's Realme, touching the suppression of Religion; and gathering unto the Kings Majestee suche other proffeits as befor haithe been spi......with the reformacion of the misde∣meanours of the clergye; saying that he trustethe to have the King his master to studie the same. And haith......me that if I cane attaigne the said acts, constitucions, and proclamacions, that I shall not adventur to sende hym thaym, but by such a proper person as he, by a secreat token whiche is devised betwene hym and me, shall send unto me for that purpose. Further he haithe aduertysed me, that it is appointed the Quene of Scotts nowe being with childe, shalbe crowned on Sondaye, the firste daye of Februarij. And thereafter shall be had a convencion of the lords, for whate purpos I cannote be certefied as yet; but as is thought aptely for the reformacion of spiritualtie. I am advertisede by one of myn espialls that the Kinge of Scotts, having at this instaunte three shipes in redynes to goe to the sees, haithe been at seen, and viewed the same; and that it is rumered a mainge the com∣mon people, thay shulde be prepairede for the Kyng to goe to the meating in France. My Lord, conscidering theffects of the premisses, I thought my duetie could be noe les thene of the same with deligence to advertise your Lordshipe. Wherin as shall further stande withe the Kings maiesties pleasure to commaunde me, even soe I shall, God willing, applie myn utter deligence, by the grace of the hollie gooste: whoe ever preserve your goode Lordshipe.

<P>IN the firste entres come in SOLAICE (whose parte was but to make mery, sing Balletts with his ffellowes, and drinke at the interluyds of the play,) whoe shewede firste to all the Audiance the play to be played, whiche was a generall thing, meanying nothing in speciall to displeas noe man, praying therfor no man to be angre with the same.
<PB N="496" REF="503"/>NEXTE come in a King, whoe passed to his throne, having noe speche to thende of the play; and thene to ratifye and approve, as in playne parliament, all things doon by the reste of the players whiche repre∣sented the three estates. With hym come his courtiers, PLACEBO, PIKTHANKE, and FLATERYE, and suche alike garde: one swering he was the lustieste, starkeste, best proportionet, and most valiaunte man, that ever was. An other swear he was the beste with longe bowe, Crosebowe and Culveren, in the world. An other swere he was the beste Juster, and man of armes in the world; and soe furthe during thair partes. THER AFTER came a man, armed in harnes, withe a swerd drawen in his hande, A BUSSHOPE, A BURGES man, and EXPE∣RIENCE, clede like a Doctor: whoe sete thaym all down on the Deis, under the KING. After thayme come a POOR MAN, whoe did goe upe and downe the scaffald, making a hevie complaynte that he was heryed throughe the Courtiers taking his fewe in one place, and, after, his tacks in an other place; wher throughe he had scayled his house, his wife and childeren beggying thair brede; and soe of many thou∣sound in Scotlande, whiche wolde make the KYNG's grace lose of men if his grace stod neide. Saying thair was noe remedye to be gotten, for thoughe he wolde suyte to the King's grace, he was naither ac∣quaynted with Controuller not Treasourer; and withoute thaym myght noe man gete noe goodeness of the King. And after he spered for the King; and whene he was shewed to the MAN that was KING in the playe, he aunsuered and said he was noe King, for ther is but one King, whiche made all and gouernethe all; whoe is eternall; to whome he and all ertheley Kings ar but officers; of the whiche thay muste make recknyng. And so furthe much meere to that effecte. And thene he looked to the KING, and saide he was not the King of Scotlande, for ther was an other King in Scotlande that hanged John Armestrang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other moe, which had pacified the countrey, and stanched thiste. But he had lefte one thing undon, whiche pertaynede aswell to his charge as thother. And whene he was asked what that was, he made a long narracion of the oppression of the poor, by the taking of the Corse presaunte beists; and of the herying of poor men by the Consistorye lawe, and of many other abussions of the Spiritualtie, and churche; with many long stories and auctoraties.</P>
<P>And then the BUSSHOPE roise, and rebuked hym, saying it effered not to hym to speake such matiers; commaunding to hym scilence, or ells to suffer dethe for it, by thair lawe. Therafter roise the MAN OF ARMES, alledginge the contrarie, and commaunded the POOR MAN to speake, saying their abusion hade been over longe suffered, withowte any lawe. Thene the POOR MAN shewed the grete abusion of Busshopes, Preletts, Abbotts, reving mens Wiss, and Doughters, and
<PB N="497" REF="504"/>holding thaym; and of the maynteynyng of thair Childer; and of thair over bying of lords and Barrons Eldeste sones, to ther Doughters, wher throughe the nobilitie of the Blode of the Realme was degenerate. And of the greate superfluous Rents that pertayned to the churche, by reason of over muche temporall lands given to thaym; which thaye proved that the Kinge might take, boothe by the Canon Lawe, and Civile Lawe. And of the greate abomynable vices that Reiagne in clostures; and of the common bordelles that was keped in Clostures of Nunies. All this was prouit by EXPERIENCE. And alsoe was shewed THOFFICE of a Busshope, and producit the Newe Testament, with the auctorities to that effecte. And thene roise the MAN OF ARMES, and the BURCES; and did saye that all that was producit, by the POOR MAN and EXPERIENCE was reasonable, of veritie, and of greate effecte; and very expedient to be reaformed withe the consent of parliament. And the BUSSHOPE said he wold not consent thereunto. The MAN OF ARMES and BURGES said they were twoe, and he but one, wherfor thair voice shuld have mooste effecte. Therafter the KING in the playe ra∣tefied, approued, and confermed, all that was rehersed.</P>

<P>MY Lorde, with herty recommendations, theese shalbe t'advertise you, that yesterninght cam unto the Barwick the Pursevaunt, from Lancaster the Harault, whom he left at Edenborough; and had taken his leve of the King, and remayned for letters to the King's Majestie. He brought me word from the saide Lancaster, that the King of Scotts commawnded hym to sende me worde that, on Mondaie or Tewesdaie at the furthest, he wold sende unto me somme of his owne house, and somme of the borders by those termes.</P>
<P>The said Lancaster sent me worde also that the King there had handeled hym very gentlelie; and that he saide unto hym he wold never brek with the King his Uncle during his lif; with many mo very good words, wiche he wold showe me at his commyng hither, which he thought to be on Mondaie nexte at the furthest. And this is all he sent me worde of.</P>
<P>My Lord, t'adverise you further of suche newes as I do lerne, I shall molest you with the longer letter. The said Barwick saithe that, on Thursdaie last, a proclamation was made at Edenborough, every man betwene xvi and lx yeres of age to be redy upon xxiiii houres warnyng, uppon payne of deathe; and like proclamations were sent to all the parties of Scotlande.</P>
<P>Also a secret frende, who I knowe to bere moche favour to therle of Anguyshe, and hath a great authoritie about th'ordinaunce of Scotland, shewed hym that ther was newe trymmed, and parte of them newe made, in the Castle of Edenborough, xvi great peces, as Canons and Culveryns, and lx smaller peces for the felde: and that all they shold be fully redy within xx daies after Ester.</P>
<P>Also he herde on Wednysdaie last a Sermon preached before the yownge quene at Lithkoo, by a Frier: and the great parte of the Sermon was in extolling of the Bushop of Rome's authoritie. And ther was present the Bushoppes of Glaskoo, Galoway, and Aberdene; and no temporall Lords.</P>
<P>Also he saith that diverse honest persones of his acquayntaunce there did aske hym howe we did agree with Fraunce: sayng further if ye and Fraunce agree well, we and ye shall agree well; for as Fraunce doth with you, so woll we do. And these be the newes in effect that he can shewe me.</P>
<P>By diverse other waies I am advertised that the Clergie of Scotlande be in such feare that their King should do theire, as the King's Highnes
<PB N="499" REF="506"/>hath done in this Realme, that they do their best to bring their master to the warr. And by many waies I am advertised that a great parte of the temporalitie there wold their King shold followe our insample; which I pray God yeve hym Grace to comme unto.</P>
<P>My Lord, I beleve th'abbot of Arbroth, nowe Bushop of Sainct Andrewes, is gone in to Fraunce, to knowe what helpe his M' shall have, aswell of the Frenche King as of the Bushoppe of Rome, if he breke with us: without whose great helpe, I beleve he woll not breke withe us.</P>
<P>Some saye in Scotlande that he woll go from Fraunce unto Rome. Some saie he sholde be at a meting, that shalbe betwene themperor and the French King. Wher so ever he shalbe comme, I think he woll provoke all the hurt he can against this Realme; for England hath no gretter enemy to his power.</P>
<P>The young quene is all papist; and the olde quene not moche less, as I am informed: and she hath taken Henry Stewarde agayne. She is now at Sterlyn, and therfore Berwick could not speke w<SUP>th</SUP> her; wherof I am sorry.</P>

<P>THE KING has not a negative in making Laws, but must ratifie what is agreed by the plurality of votes: his authority is summoning, and dissolving, the parliament. And in publishing their Laws, they are content that the Prince use more shew and flourish of authority, in the preface to their Laws, than indeed he has, as in the Laws of <HI>Re∣giam majestatem.</HI> Many of the Magistrates and publique officers are not of the King's creating, but hereditary; as the Constableship, Mareschalship, Admiraltie, Shereffship; the latter not only execute the <HI>res judicatas,</HI> as with us, but judge themselves both in Civil and Criminal matters. Besides the Lords of Session at Edinburgh are ap∣pointed by themselves; and those recommended to the King may be put off from the Bench. Pardon and Execution in matters Criminal, is not peculiar to the crown; for diverse of the nobility have <HI>Jus Here∣ditarium</HI> in matters criminal, to execute and pardon, within their precincts, as absolutely as the King. The Prince has not absolute authority in making Leagues or War, but must have the consent of the Estates; the subjects at first are only obliged to follow their King 30 days upon their own provision, unlesse they agree it by a new Con∣vention; this besides the lessening the Prince's authority, gives cause to mutinies between the Prince and his nobles, and advantage to the ...... by protracting the time ...... which lie not univer∣saly to the Prince for several of the nobility hold and execute ..... Justice absolutely without appeal to the Prince, within their Jurisdictions by Charter ...... which the Prince cannot avoid nor take from them. As for example, in the Earl of Mortoun's Charter, which king James the 3d tare openly in Parliament, offended with the Clauses of it, especially with this point of no appellation to the Prince, adding that the Prince himself could have no more. But before he removed from the place where he tare it, he was forced by the nobility to sit down, and sew it up again with his own hands; wherefore it is called <HI>the sewed Charter.</HI> Besides sentence of the Lords of the Session is peremptory, and not remissable by the Prince, saveing where it con∣cerneth
<PB N="502" REF="509"/>his own private. These limitations doth he suffer in the more Southerly parts; among the Highlanders he seemeth to have no more authority than he can get by interest or force.</P>

<P><HI>Customes,</HI> which cannot be great, by reason of the small exportation which the country yieldeth, as Fish, Salt, Hides, which amounts in the whole but to £. 200, 000, per ann. <HI>ex Relatione Conservatoris publici,</HI> the Custom whereof cannot be ........<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blank in original.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>Mines of Lead</HI> farmed to one Custome, whereof no profit cometh yet to the King.

Scotch money, which are few, except those which appertain to Abbies, &amp;c. which reserve their Immunities; whereby the commodity cannot be great, the number of all the Bene∣fices in Scotland not exceeding 900.</P>
<P><HI>Tax and Imposition,</HI> in the Southern parts, where they have money, and the people acknowledge some more duty, is imposed sometimes for the King's relief, but the Soum is very small. The State seemeth something like the Lacedemonian Mula, but somewhat worser sett, for that the King and Ephori amongs the Lacedemonians had their autho∣rity determined, and well agreed upon; here it is uncertain, and under continuall contentions, jealousies, and emulations, and their Parliament lesse orderly than the Senate of the Ephori; whereby great inconveni∣ence groweth to their Commonwealth, whilst their Kings, who are commonly men of good spirit, contend with the nobility about autho∣rity, and would fain enlarge themselves, which seemeth to have cost
<PB N="503" REF="510"/>many a King's life among them. And in the mean while Order and Discipline in their Commonwealth fadeth loose betwixt both the autho∣rities of Prince and nobility, whilst they follow factions and particu∣larities. Besides this constitution of their Commonwealth, the want of money and reverence causeth the want of authority in the Prince, both to keep that in Order which he hath, and to recover that which he hath not.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Excess in proportion of the Nobility.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Number,</HI> which being more than so small a kingdom can well <HI>bear, viz. more than in England, and their Country much lesse</HI> and lesse fertile, must breed great inconvenience to their Commonwealth. And, first, to eclipse and overshadow the Prince's authority. 2<SUP>d•</SUP>, To make the Government more heavy upon his hand, by reason so many of the mightier sort. Thirdly, to overcharge the Country, and make lesse the proportion for the other Estates in their Ranks and Degrees, viz. for the Prince and for the Commons, whilst all these must have to maintain their Degrees and Nobility. Fourthly, it layeth the State open to Division and faction, by means of Envies, Emulation, &amp;c. about particularities, for honor, and Commodities; which doth and must fall out, where are so many great ones in so nar∣row room.</P>
<P><HI>Authority of the Peers,</HI> first they are all born Counsellours to the State. 2dly, in the Legislature, Leagues, Peace and War, making officers, determining in high Justice, and other matters of State, their Authority is joint and necessary with the Prince's, and more than can stand in a just Monarchy; the more because most Burrows are at the devotion of some Noblemen, as Cowper in Fiffe manag'd by the Earl of Rothes, Perth by Montrose, Dundee by Crawfurd, all the North∣ern Towns at the Earl of Huntley's command: whereby they have both their own and their Commons vote in Parliament, and so nothing can passe to prejudice the Estate of the Nobility, or enlarge the Prince's. Their authority over their Tenents, Clients, and Vassals, is so great, that they regard more their Patron or Noblemen as their Prince. The reasons whereof are, first, in publick matters their Autho∣rity is so great. Secondly, for that the whole Country hath few or no freeholders, but such as hold at the Lord's pleasure from year to year; whereby they are made thralld and obnoxious to him, having their whole estate and living depending on their Lords, and so are made servile, and at his commandment life and all.</P>
<P><HI>Revenew.</HI> Some have from 15 to 20 Chaulders of victual per annum, besides some part in money, which may amount to £. 26000
<PB N="504" REF="511"/>Scots: which the great number of the nobility considered, this must exceed in proportion, and draw from the other two estates viz. the Prince and Commons. And this seems to be the Cause of all Scottish distempers, their often contentions, mutinies, partly whilst they join fast against the Prince, in keeping things in the State they are now in behalf of the Nobility, wherein they are too hard for the Prince: partly when they have fewds and quarrels amongst themselves, about their Lands, honor, and Jurisdictions, wherein are engaged the whole number of their Tenants, Vassals, and Servants, without furder re∣gard of their Prince's Laws or Equity; and especially amongst the Highlanders.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Defect in proportion amongst the Commonality.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Burghers, viz. Merchands and other Tradesmen. Merchands</HI> there are few, and mean for wealth, by reason of the small exportation, which the Country affordeth of few things, as of Fish, Salt, Hydes, Coarse-woll, which yeildeth not more than £. 200, 000 Starling; most of which goes out for forreign Commodities as Wines, &amp;c, and so cannot grow rich by that Rule, <HI>Divitem et bonum Patrem-familias ven∣dere opportet non emere.</HI> He is counted a rich Merchand who is worth £. 100 Starling. <HI>Handicrastsmen</HI> have but small Trade, and their Trades but few; by reason the people are but poor, and accustomed to live hardly, without any variety of Diet, apparell, &amp;c. whereby they have the lesse use of divers occupations, and other Handicrafts men make lesse return. There are 3 Trades for some Commodities, some coarse cloth making, Armory making, and Linnen Cloath: all from hand to mouth. Of <HI>Lawyers</HI> there are but few, and these about the Sessions at Edinburgh; for that in the Shires all matters are ended at the great mens' pleasures. These are of mean wealth, and bear more duty and respect towards the Prince. <HI>Husbandmen</HI> are very poor; they are a kind of Slaves, and pay in a manner to their Lord all the Com∣modities that come of their Labour, reserving to themselves at the year's end in a manner nothing but to live.</P>
<P>This defect of the Commonalty, viz. that there are so few of the middle Rank of Subjects amongst, that are able to live competently and honestly of their own, and by that means are a band to tie to∣gether the 2 Extremes, viz. the higher sort and the rascallity; and to sway with the better and more peaceable part, as having something to loose; is another great cause of the distemper and disquietness of that Realm. For by that means the whole Commonalty in a manner, a few excepted which are of no reckoning in comparison of the whole, being
<PB N="505" REF="512"/>beggarly and rascall, are ever apt for faction and tumult when occasion serveth; as having nothing to lose, and hoping to get something, when they may fish in a troubled sea; and so follow their Lords quarrells either amongst themselves, or against the Prince. Whereby the Prince and Commonwealth is ever weaning and floating, like a boat in the sea, to and fro, <HI>Vento nobilitatis et vulgi fluctibus.</HI></P>
