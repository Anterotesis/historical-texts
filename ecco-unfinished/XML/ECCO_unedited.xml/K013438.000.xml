<HEAD>Scotland in Danger,
OR,
A Serious Enquiry into the Dangers which SCOTLAND
has been in, is now in, or may be in since the
UNION;
With some Humble Proposals for the REMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>HE that Undertakes to Instruct a Nation, ought to be very
well Fortified against publick Reproach. In this Wise Age
Men are apt to be ill Natur'd, when you pretend to Inform
them, and the Wisdom they think they have Qualifies them
immediately to think they want no Teaching.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>However this may happen, Gentlemen in the North of <HI>Britain,</HI>
here is one that think<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself Oblig'd to venture to speak <HI>a Word <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Season</HI> to you; he hopes you that have no Need of it, <HI>or that think you
have none, for that is almost the same thing,</HI> will bear with it for the sake
of some, that having less<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wit than you may want it.</P>
<P>He Professes himself convinc'd, that what he shall say is not only
Truth, but useful Truth, and as such, he hopes you will Improve it
to your own Advantage; but whether you will or no, he Acknow∣ledges
himself unable to Refrain in mee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Respect to your Welfare,
and mov'd with a Sense of your Danger.</P>
<P>And he is perswaded, that what he shall say now, will have so
much Force with it, so evidently clear up his sincere Intentions for
your Good, and be so Convincing to all your Judgments, that he
hopes for a more favourable Reception on now than ever.</P>
<P>The Title of this Paper is like a Man crying Fire in your Streets,
upon the first Allarm, at which your immediate Inquiry is, <HI>Where▪
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>
where?</HI> When a Stranger comes among you and cryes out, Danger,
Danger, <HI>Scotland</HI> in Danger, he ought to be furnish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Answer your
immediate Enquiry, from whence? What is it? and what are we in
Danger from?</P>
<P>Let me therefore first Examine these Dangers; for the Disease must
be known before the Cure be prescribed—. The Dangers to be
hinted at may be divided
<LIST>
<ITEM>Into
<LIST>
<ITEM>Dangers past.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dangers present.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dangers to come.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By Dangers past is to be Understood, <HI>such as seem to be past;</HI> for if
they were really past, they would be no Dangers—: And yet I
shall not say much to put you upon the Uneasiness of expecting their
Return.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have made an Attempt upon you, and this is meant by
the <HI>Dangers past:</HI> It is not the Design of this Paper to put you in Fear
of their Return<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but neither do I think you ought to try whether you
can Tempt them to come again or no.</P>
<P>Pray, Gentlemen, will you then look back to what prompted them
to come here before; we are told of Invitations and Personal En∣couragements;
<HI>I have nothing to say</HI> to those things, a Man can
hardly imagine any Man so cruel to his Countrey, as to call in the
<HI>French;</HI> if any such thing was. I believe all Honest Men will joyn <HI>in
this Wis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> that it may be Detected, and the Persons brought to Justice:
But till it is proved I say nothing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but <HI>Curra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lex,</HI> the Government is
Fishing for it, let it go as it will.</P>
<P>But shall I tell you, Friends and Countrey Men, very plainly, you
have all been Guilty of Inviting over the <HI>French;</HI> not that I am going
to Pannel you all now <HI>Laesae Majestatis,</HI> and call you all Traitours by
Craft; but take me right, Gentlemen, I must say it again, you have
all been Guilty of Inviting over the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>To Explain my self and prove this, I shall briefly Name particulars.
1. Your naked Posture as to Defence has been a Call to your Enemies,
who, not doubting of a strong Party among you, must needs think
the Strength you have had, was a most contemptible thing to prevent
a Surprize: Your Unfortified Coast, your Unfurnished Forts, your Few
Forces, your Unsettled Militia, these have all been strong Invitations
to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>But as these are the Effects of your yet Settling, and Unsettled Infant
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
State <HI>as to the Union,</HI> so the Government seems Vigorous in their
Application to Restore you in those Cases to a State of Defence, and
therefore this can be no part of the Danger of Inviting the Enemy to
Return. I Wish the next Case stood as fair for a Cure.</P>
<Q><P>2. The Number and Armed Posture of your Indwelling Enemies,
from whom such an Invasion as we are Talking of is made but too
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eazible: But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>3. And which is the main Point, your Divisions at Home; your
Party Divisions, your Religious Divisions, your <HI>Jacobite</HI> Divisions,
your Popish Divisions, and at last, your Union Divisions, <HI>an
unhappy Word that is!</HI> These were, and still are the Invitations to
a Foreign Enemy; these brought him Over, and these alone ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Endanger his Return.</P></Q>
<P>In these things I place the Dangers of <HI>Scotland</HI> past: I shall
Recapitulate them again presently▪ but I first pass on to the Generals.
The <HI>Second</HI> Head is of Dangers present.</P>
<P>These arise from a miserable Dearth of Charity and Neighbourhood,
and a strange Contagion of Strife and Disaffection to one another,
which is spread among us, and which threatens this Countrey with
innumerable Mischiefs and Disorders. And this contains the Third
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Dangers to come: You will Pardon me for joining
the Causes and the Consequences together.</P>
<P>I have always been a Foreteller of Good from the Union, and have
put you in hopes of much upon that Head; but, Gentlemen, pray
Remember this, <HI>and bear Witness for me,</HI> I never told <HI>Britain</HI> on either
hand, North or South, that the Union would do you good <HI>whether
you would or no;</HI> that in spight of Jarring Parties, Ambitious Interests,
Unnatural Strifes, and the spreading Poisons of Envy, Party Malice,
and the like, the Union would make you happy.</P>
<P>In short, shall I tell you a new, but plain and positive Truth, and I
lay it down as <HI>a Thesis,</HI> which I shall Enlarge upon a little hereafter:
If you will not add Peace to Union, it is impossible you should Reap
any Advantage by it; if you will not joyn mutual Assistance, and
bring an Uniting Temper and the Union together, even God himself,
<HI>I speak it with an awful Concern for you,</HI> can not without Working some∣thing
Miraculous, and out of the ordinary Course of his Providence,
make the Union Effectual to you.</P>
<P>Shall I be plain, and lead you back a little by the Hand to see the want
of this Temper? What Objections any have made against the Union I have
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
nothing to say to here, nor why they made them; But has there been
no Imprudence in the Manner, no Extreams in your Aversions to the
Union, and particularly in the Expressions of it in Publick?</P>
<P>I speak it without boasting, No Man has concern'd himself more than
the Author of this Paper to clear up the Suspition Entertained among your
Brethren in <HI>England</HI> of the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> Joining with the
<HI>French,</HI> and falling in with the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest, But shall I ask you, Gentle∣men
calmly, Did not the Warmth of some People here in Declaring them∣selves
even on the Newsof the <HI>French</HI> Preparations, too much assist your
Enemies to raise that Scandal on you? yes and too much Encourage
the <HI>French</HI> to expect it would be true; To what other purpose could
it tend, and what a Handle did you thereby give your Enemies to
attack you, how much Discourage your Friends in <HI>England</HI> in their Ex∣pectations
from you, and weaken their hands in helping you?</P>
<P>Shall I go further, Did not these Imprudent Excursions help to bring
forward the unhappy Difficulty of Imposing Oaths? Did not this help
to make those Assurances seem needful, even to those who had no
mind to put hardships upon you, and give Pretence to those that
had?</P>
<P><HI>Abroad,</HI> These were the common Arguments about <HI>Scotland, First,</HI> The
Episcopal and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, they are ready to Close with the <HI>French,</HI>
and, (2.) As for the Presbyterian Party, they are so generally Surfeited
with, and Disgusted at the Union, that they will come in only to get the
Union Dissolved, or at least will stand Neuter.</P>
<P>This was the Language both of your Friends and Enemies: It was the
Language of your Enemies as they made use of it to prompt the
<HI>French</HI> King to the Attempt, to Discourage the <HI>English</HI> in their
Opposition, and to blow up the vain Hope of their Party in <HI>England</HI> to
assist in your Destruction; and it was the Language of your Friends,
as it was the Effect of their Fears for you, the Report having been
Universal, and no Body contradicting it.</P>
<P>I can but touch these things here, perhaps I may speak more largely
to them again▪ I wish they were heartily considered among us all, not
to accuse one another, and rectiminate upon one another, but to cor∣rect
every Man for himself, whatever Share he has had in it.</P>
<P>And let us come now to our present State, The <HI>French</HI> have been at
our Doors, GOD had brought the Nation upon us threatned in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Deut. 50, 51. A Nation from a far Countrey, of a fierce Countenance,
and who would not regard the Person of the Old, nor shew Favour to the Young,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
that should eat the Fruit of our Cattel, and the Fruit of our Land, and should
leave us neither Corn nor Wine▪ nor Oil, until he had destroyed us.</HI>
But He has had Compassion upon us, and saved us from our Fears
and the Storm is blown over▪ the black Cloud hovered over us,—but
the Thunder brake not upon us.</P>
<P>Some have promised them selves, that as the French have done us
no Harm, they have done us a great deal of Good, and rationally
speaking, one would think it should be so.</P>
<P>Could you but realize the Dangers you have escaped, could you
but form Ideas of the Operation of this dreadful Physick, had it been
administred, me thinks it must have an Influence upon your Judgments,
your Wishes, and your Practice.</P>
<P>Do but fancy the <HI>French</HI> Landed at <HI>Leith,</HI> with a Superior Force to
what you had here to resist them; imagine the Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> retreated
with the little Army you had here towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> as in the Prudence
of a General he might be supposed to do.</P>
<P>Imagine then <HI>Edinburgh surrendred</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> which I presume no
Man will pretend to suppose could be avoided; nay, perhaps you
would have been obliged to have entreated the <HI>French</HI> to take Possessi∣on
to protect you from worse indwelling Enemies, and more terrible
Rabbles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>When the <HI>French</HI> were in Possession, you could not have expected less
from them than such things as these.</P>
<Q><P><HI>1st.</HI> That they should summon your Magistrates together, and
oblige them to proclaim their New Pretender.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> That they should then summon the Inhabitants to swear Al∣legiance
to him, and perhaps renounce the Revolution and Successi∣on
as an Equivalent for the Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uration.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> Make Proclamation, that all that were fled or absconded
should return to their Habitation, on pain of Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscation of
Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Less than this I am perswaded, no man can imagine rational, that
knows any thing of National Revolutions, what Riflings and Exactions
of Contributions might be added, I do not enquire.</P>
<P>Upon this new Oath,—what Sacrifices would have been made,
what Martyrdoms suffered, what Inundation of Highlanders, what
Rabbling, what Plunder, and what Blood, I refer to your sedate
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Thoughts to reflect on; and I shall tell you presently what use I make
of all this. Well, this Scene of Danger is over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behold another!</P>
<P>Now we are come to choosing a new <HI>British</HI> Parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Crisis
which this Nation never met with before: and shall I confess now,
<HI>for I would be impartial,</HI> that I think the Union will do you some
Harm here; I mean, in infecting you with the Horrid Bribeties, Parti∣alities,
Envvings, and Party making practised too much in <HI>England,</HI>
and which Honest Men have struggled both in Parliament, and out of
Parliament, to restrain.</P>
<P>I cannot but mention it as a thing melancholly enough, to see the
Gentlemen and Noblemen of <HI>Britain</HI> making a perfect War among
themselves, to obtain an Employment of Peace; a War of Families, and
a War of Interests; what Strife, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t Contention, what Envying,
Siding, and Party-making, to get into a Station, which their Country
ought to hire them to discharge.</P>
<P>What can the meaning of this be, Gentlemen? That People should
spend their Money, give Bribes and Rewards, and be at Expense to Sit
in a place where they cannot get one Groat Honestly by sitting? There
must be something more in this than is known; this must be some Fi∣gure
in Politicks, like <HI>a Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s</HI> in Speech<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which there is more signi∣fied
than is expressed—. And what shall we say to <HI>Andrew Marvel</HI>'s
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld Proverb, that <HI>he that B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must Sell.</HI> I will not explain it as look∣ing
so here; but his Meaning he explain'd publickly to be, That he
that would buy the Country to Choose him, would sell the Country
when they had Chosen him: Nay he went further, he said they MUST
do so, that is, <HI>to get their Money again.</HI> It is indeed an unaccountable
thing, that a Man should spend a Thousand Pound to get leave to go
to <HI>London</HI> where he must perhaps spend 500 more▪ meerly for the ser∣vice
of his Country, and get nothing by it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too in an Age,
when every body knows they have long le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off the Folly of being
publick Spirited, as a thing obsole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and quite out of Fashion.</P>
<P>History tells us a Story of <HI>William R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>,</HI> the Second King of <HI>England</HI>
from the Conquest; That having an Abby to bestow in Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ Several of
the Clergy knowing the King to be Cove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, bid large Sums for the
place; the King seing a Monk <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and by that offered nothing, and took no
notice of it, asked him, <HI>And what wilt thou g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve for this Abbay?</HI> Indeed
not one Peny; <HI>says the Monk,</HI> for it is against my Conscience. <HI>Then,</HI>
says the King, <HI>Thou art the fittest Man to be A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot,</HI> and so gave him the
Abby immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
The Application is very short Gentlemen; You have here a great
many Instructors that set up to teach you, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etend to advise you
<HI>who to choose,</HI> some one sort, some another; will you but please to take
the Moral of this Story, and you will need no bodys Instruction; do
but choose the Men that will not spend one Peny to be chose; Men that
will not go over their Thresholds to to be Chose—Men that in Consci∣ence
cannot bribe, nor buy your Voices, a Man may without Hazard
pledge his Life, that such a Man will serve you Impartially when he is
chosen.</P>
<P>But this Bribing, Treating, making Partys and Interests to be cho∣sen
is a wicked <HI>English</HI> Custom—, and what has been the end of it,
truly that <HI>England</HI> has been at the Brink of Destruction by Bribing
and bribed Members, when of 513 Members, 180 were Pensioners to
the King, hired to vote as he liked, and to give away the Nations Mo∣ney
whenever he asked it—. This was the time when two Gentlemen
in Kent, Sir <HI>John Banks</HI> and Collonel <HI>Draper</HI> by Name, spend 11000
<HI>lib.</HI> Sterling at one Election, to get into Parliament at a little Town
called <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> all the Houses in which were not worth a quarter part
of the Money.</P>
<P>Now as these Men got Pensions <HI>when in,</HI> for Services they were to do;
there was some Reason to be shown why they should spend Money
but as the Members now chosen can expect no such Clandestine do∣ings,
what can be the Meaning now of this unhappy Practice?</P>
<P>Shall I tell you, the design, it is equally wicked now, and perhaps in
its kind as pernicious, <HI>viz.</HI> Supporting Parties, clubing and forming
Classes, and Clans in the House of Commons, in which is couched the
Ruine of our Peace, the Overthrow of the Administration, and the in∣volving
us in innumerable Confusions.</P>
<P>Let but your Eyes look round you, and see, Gentlemen, what absur∣dities
begin to be practised among you, and what a War of Interest is
here begun already, and where it will end, GOD knows.</P>
<P>Here Whigs put up Tories, and Vote against Whig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: There Tories put up Whigs,
and Vote against Tories; here Party interferes with Relation, and there with Religi∣on;
Here Papists solicit for Whigs, and <HI>Jacobites</HI> take the Oath <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Vote for Revolution
Men There Episcopal Men Qualifie to Vote for Presbyterians, Fathers Vote against their
Sons, and Kindred against Kindred, no Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are observed or regarded in Electing,
and Party Supercedes Relation.</P>
<P>And what does all this say to us, but prognosticate a miserable self interested
Game, pursuing Parties, and swaying for publick Managements, not regarding the
Countreys Interest, or so much as thinking of the Duty and Trust of a Representa∣tive.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Here I could open a large Scene of Dangers worse than <HI>French</HI> Invasions, or <HI>Alman∣sa</HI>
Victories, Dangers that reach the Vitals of <HI>Britain,</HI> and threaten the Teeming Uni∣on
with instant abortions; Dangers, that in Spight of all Prospect, will Defeat the
Advantages both Nations might re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p by the hearty Pursuit of it, and Dangers which
threaten Our Religion, Our Liberty, Our Possessions, Our Commerce, and Our Po∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erity.</P>
<P>In electing of Members to represent you in Parliament, you give your hand to the
Securing or Betraying your Liberties, your Laws, your Constitution, and your Na∣tion.
You cannot but remember, Gentlemen, That before the Union, great Objecti∣ons
were made against the Treaty, for that your Nation would be overpowered in a
<HI>British</HI> Parliament, Out-v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, and you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berties in Danger, your Church and your
Constitution be in danger of being subjected to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I must acq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> esce with that Objection, if you Choose Men who will give you up to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Party in <HI>England</HI> that are for subjecting you—; But you are also to remember there
are in <HI>England</HI> a Party of Men P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rons of Liberty, who neither will enslave you, nor
be Slaves themselves, who have twisted and incorporated your Liberties and their own,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd both with the Government and their Laws, that all will stand and fall together.</P>
<P>If you choose Men that have a Sense of Liberty, a Sense of the Advantage of Laws,
and of a Government that adhere to them, and Governs by them, you will be secure
and they too; you will strengthen the Hands of the Men of Truth, and enable them
to defend both you and themselves: If you Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Mercenarys, Enemies to the Go∣vernment,
Men careless of their own Liberty, or of yours either, they will be drawn
in to join with a Party that will destroy you, and you ruine both your selves and your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends.</P>
<P>There are M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that please themselves at railing at their Governours, and think all
Men Honest that complain of the Knav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of others; but this new Viso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will detect
it self—. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me was indeed, our Courts and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Kings have been our Betrayers and
Undoers; But whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Princes govern by Law, and abandon their Agents universally to
Justice, as the Queen intir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly does, the Murmur at the Governours and the Ministry,
must be a State Trick to deceive the Innocent, and put the Face of a Patriot on the
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hinati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of a Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r.</P>
<P>All the Clamo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r at the Ministry, and at Mismanagement, have been effectually
silenced by this, where is the Man that has betrayed our Councils, neglected the pub∣lick
Business, omitted his Duty, or misapplyed the Treasure, Charge him in Parlia∣ment,
and see if the Queen protects him?</P>
<P>Railing at the Court therefore, makes now no Patriot, and is no Rule to Judge by—.
But if you will choose Men to serve you Honestly; let them be Men of tried Principles,
known Characters, and profes'd Concern for your Countreys L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berties—. Upstarts▪
New Converts, Men come lately over, and perhaps hardly come over to Honest
Principles, Men known to you but by Recommendation, and perhaps but indifferent∣ly
recommended either; these will never save <HI>Scotland</HI> from her present Dangers:
The Strife and Contention that now appears, has a Melancholly Aspect, and plainly
tells us the Gentlemen are pursuing their Parties and their private Interests, not the
Good of their Country; such are not likely to be Champions of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Liberties, to
defend her against the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>achments of her Private Enemies, or to restore her Prospe∣rity—:
And therefore while this Contention of Parties continues, I must be excused
to tell you very seriously, that <HI>Scotland</HI> is in manifest Danger.</P>
