ON PUBLICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not unamusing to consider the se∣veral
apologies that people make when
they commence authors. It is taken for granted
that on every publication there is at least a
seeming violation of modesty; a presumption,
on the writer's side, that he is able to instruct
or to entertain the world; which implies a
supposition that he can communicate, what they
cannot draw from their own reflexions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
To remove any prejudice this might occa∣sion,
has been the general intent of prefaces.
Some we find extremely sollicitous to claim
acquaintance with their reader; addressing him
by the most tender and endearing appellations.
He is in general styled the most loving, candid,
and courteous creature that ever breathed; with
a view, doubtless, that he will deferve the com∣pliment;
and that his favor may be secured at
the expence of his better judgment. Mean
and idle expectation! The accidental elope∣ments
and adventures of a composition; the
danger of an imperfect and surreptitious publi∣cation;
the pressing and indiscreet instances of
friends; the pious and well-meant frauds of
acquaintance; with the irresistible commands of
persons in high life; have been excuses often
substituted in place of the real motives, vanity
and hunger.</P>
<P>THE most allowable reasons for appearing
thus in public, are either the advantage or
amusement of our fellow-creatures; or our own
private emolument and reputation.</P>
<P>A MAN possessed of intellectual talents would
be more blameable in confining them to his
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
own private use, than the mean-spirited miser, that
did the same by his money. The latter is indeed
obliged to bid adieu to what he communicates;
the former enjoys his treasures, even while he
renders others the better for them. A compo∣sition
that enters the world with a view of im∣proving
or amusing it, (I mean only, amusing
it in a polite or innocent way) has a claim to
our utmost indulgence, even though it fail of
the effect intended.</P>
<P>WHEN a writer's private interest appears
the motive of his publication, the reader has a
larger scope for accusation, if he be a sufferer.
Whoever pays for thoughts, which this kind of
writers may be said to vend, has room enough
to complain, if he be disappointed of his bargain.
He has no revenge, but ridicule; and, contrary
to the practice in other cases, to make the worst
of a bad bargain.</P>
<P>WHEN the love of same acts upon a man
of genius, the case appears to stand thus. The
generality of the world, distinguished by the
name of readers, observe with a reluctance not
unnatural, a person raising himself above them.
All men have some desire of fame, and fame is
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
grounded on comparison. Every one then is
somewhat inclined to dispute his title to a supe∣riority;
and to disallow his pretensions upon
the discovery of a flaw. Indeed, a fine writer,
like a luminous body, may be beneficial to the
person he enlightens; but, it is plain, he renders
the opacity of the other more discernible—Exami∣nation,
however, is a sort of turnpike in the
way to fame, where, though a writer be a while
detained, and part with a trifle from his pocket,
he finds in return a more commodious and easy
road to the temple.</P>
<P>WHEN, therefore, a man is conscious of
ability to serve his country, or believes himself
possessed of it (for there is no previous test on
this occasion) he has no room to hesitate, or
need to make apology—When self-interest
inclines a man to print, he should consider that
the purchaser expects a pennyworth for his
penny; and has reason to asperse his honesty
if he finds himself deceived—Also, that it is
possible to publish, a book of no value, which
is too frequently the product of such mercenary
people.—When fame is the principal object
of our devotion, it should be considered whether
our character is like to gain in point of wit, what
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
it will probably lose in point of modesty:
otherwise we shall be censured of vanity more than
famed for genius; and depress our character while
we strive to raise it.</P>
<P>AFTER all, there is a propensity in some
to communicate their thoughts without any view
at all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the more sanguine of these employ the
press; the less lively are contented with being
impertinent in conversation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>On the Test of popular opinion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAPPEN to fall into company with a citizen,
a courtier, and an academick.</P>
<P>SAYS the citizen, I am told continually of taste,
refinement, and politeness; but methinks the
vulgar and illiterate generally approve the same
productions with the connoiseurs. One rarely
finds a landskip, a building, or a play that has
charms for the critick exclusive of the mechanick.
But on the other hand one readily remarks stu∣dents
who labour to be dull, depraving their
native relish by the very means they use to re∣fine
it. The vulgar may not indeed be capable
of giving the reasons why a composition pleases
them. That mechanical distinction they leave
to the connoiseur. But they are at all times
methinks judges of the beauty of an effect,
a part of knowledge in most respects allowedly
more genteel than that of the operator.</P>
<P>SAYS the courtier, I cannot answer for every
individual instance; but I think moderately speak∣ing,
the vulgar are generally in the wrong. If
they happen to be otherwise, it is principally
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing to their implicit reliance on the skill of
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
their superiors: and this has sometimes been
strangely effectual in making them imagine they
relish perfection. In short, if ever they judge
well, it is at the time they least presume to frame
opinions for themselves.</P>
<P>IT is true they will pretend to taste an object
which they know their betters do. But then
they consider some persons judgment as a cer∣tain
standard or rule; they find the object ex∣actly
tally; and this demonstrated appearance
of beauty affords them some small degree of
satisfaction.</P>
<P>IT is the same with regard to the appetite from
which the metaphor of taste is borrowed. “Such
a soup or ollio, say they, is much in vogue, and
if you do not like it, you must learn to like
it.”</P>
<P>BUT in poetry, for instance, it is urged that
the vulgar, discover the same beauties with the
man of reading.</P>
<P>Now half or more of the beauties of poetry
depend on metaphor or allusion, neither of which,
by a mind uncultivated can be applied to their
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
proper counterparts. Their beauty of conse∣quence
is like a picture to a blind man.</P>
<P>How many of these peculiarities in poetry
turn upon a knowledge of philosophy and history:
and let me add these latent beauties give the most
delight to such as can unfold them.</P>
<P>I MIGHT launch out much further in regard
to the narrow limits of their apprehensions—What
I have said may exclude their infallibility;
and it is my opinion they are seldom right.</P>
<P>THE Academic spoke little, but to the pur∣pose;
asserting that all ranks and stations have
their different spheres of judging: That a clown
of native taste enough to, relish Handel's Messiah,
might unquestionably be so instructed as to relish
it yet more: That an author, before he prints,
should not flatter himself with a confused expec∣tation
of pleasing both the vulgar and the polite:
Few things, in comparison, being capable of doing
both in any great degree: That he should always
measure out his plan for the size of understand∣ing
he would fit. If he can content himself with
the mob, he is pretty sure of numbers for a
time. If he write with more abundant elegance,
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
it may escape the organs of such readers; but
he will have a chance for such applause as will
more sensibly affect him. Let a writer then in
his first performances neglect the idea of profit,
and the vulgar's applause entirely: Let him ad∣dress
him to the judicious few, and then profit
and the mob will follow. His first appearance
on the stage of letters will engross the politer
compliments; and his latter will partake of the
irrational huzza.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>On allowing MERIT in OTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN gentleman was expressing him∣self
as follows.</P>
<P>I CONFESS I have no great taste for poetry;
but if I had, I am apt to believe I should read no
other poetry than that of Mr. Pope. The rest
but barely arrive at a mediocrity in their art;
and to be sure poetry of that stamp, can afford
but slender pleasure.</P>
<P>I KNOW not, says another, what may be the
gentleman's motive to give this opinion: But I
am persuaded numbers pretend the same through
mere jealousy or enyy.</P>
<P>A READER considers an author, as one who
lays claim to a superior genius. He is ever in∣clined
to dispute it, because if he happen to
Invalidate his title, he has at least one superior
the less. Now though a man's absolute merit may
not depend upon the inferiority of another, yet
his comparative worth varies in regard to that of
other people. Self-love, therefore, is ever at∣tentive
to pursue the single point of admitting no
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
more into the class of superiors, than it is impossible
to exclude. Could it even limit the number to
one, they would soon attempt to undermine him.
Even Mr. Pope had been refused his honours, but
that the very constraint, and even absurdity of
people's shutting their eyes grew as disagreeable
to them, as that excellence, which, when open,
they could not but discover.</P>
<P>BUT self-love obtains it's wishes in another re∣spect
also. It hereby not only depresses the cha∣racters
of many that have wrote, but stifles the
genius of such as might hereafter rise from
amongst our inferiors.</P>
<P>LET us not deny to Mr. Pope the praises which
a person enamoured of poetry would bestow on
one that excelled in it: But let us consider Par∣nassus
rather as a republick than a monarchy;
where, although some may be in possession of a
more cultivated spot, yet where others my possess
land as fruitful, upon equal cultivation.</P>
<P>ON the whole, let us reflect, that the nature
of the soil, and the extent of it's fertility must
remain undiscovered, if the gentleman's desponding
principle should meet with approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18"/>
MR. POPE'S chief excellence lies in what I
would term consolidating or condensing sentences,
yet preserving ease and perspicuity. In smooth∣ness
of verse, perhaps, he has been equalled:
In regard to invention, excelled.</P>
<P>ADD to this, if the writers of antiquity may
be esteemed our truest models, Mr. Pope is much
more witty, and less simple, than his own Horace
appears in any of his writings. More witty, and
less simple, than the modern Mons. Boileau, who
claimed the merit of uniting the style of Juvenal
and Persius with that of Horace.</P>
<P>SATYR gratifies self-love. This was one source
of his popularity; and he seems even so very
conscious of it as to stigmatize many inoffensiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
characters.</P>
<P>THE circumstance of what is called allitera∣tion,
and the nice adjustment of the pause have
conspired to charm the present age, but have at
the same time given his verses a very cloying
peculiarity.</P>
<P>BUT, perhaps, we must not expect to trace the
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow of Waller, the landskip of Thomson, the fire
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
Dryden, the imagery of Shakespear, the simpli∣city
of Spenser, the courtliness of Prior, the hu∣mour
of Swift, the wit of Cowley, the delicacy
of Addison, the tenderness of Otway, and the in∣vention,
the spirit, and sublimity of Milton, joined
in any single writer. The lovers of poetry, there∣fore,
should allow some praise to those who shine
in any branch of it, and only range them into
classes according to that species in which they
shine.</P>
<Q>“Quare agite, O juvenes!</Q>
<P>Banish the self-debasing principle, and scorn
the disingenuity of readers. Humility has de∣pressed
many a genius into an hermit; but never
yet raised one into a poet of eminence.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>THE IMPROMPTU.</HEAD>
<P>THE criticks, however unable to fix the
time which it is most proper to allow for
the action of an epic poem, have universally agreed
that some certain space is not to be exceeded.
Concerning this, Aristotle, their great Lycurgus, is
entirely silent. Succeeding criticks have done little
more than cavil concerning the time really taken
up by the greatest epick writers; that, if they
could not frame a law, they might at least esta∣blish
a precedent of unexceptionable authority.
Homer, say they, confined the action of his Iliad,
or rather his action may be reduced, to the space of
two months. His Odyssey, according to Bossu and
Dacier, is extended to eight years. Virgil's Aeneid
has raised very different opinions in his commen∣tators.
Tasso's poem includes a summer—But
leaving snch knotty points to persons that appear
born for the discussion of them, let us endeavor to
establish laws that are more likely to be obeyed,
than controverted. An epic writer, though limited
in regard to the time of his action, is under no
sort restraint with regard to the time he
takes to finish his poem. Far different is the
case with a writer of Impromptu's. He indeed is
allowed all the liberties that he can possibly take
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
in his composition, but is rigidly circumscribed with
regard to the space in which it is compleated.
And no wonder; for whatever degree of poig∣nancy
may be required in this composition, it's
peculiar merit must ever be relative to the expe∣dition
with which it is produced.</P>
<P>IT appears indeed to me to have the nature
of that kind of sallad, which certain eminent
adepts in chemistry have contrived to raise, while
a joint of mutton is roasting. We do not allow
ourselves to blame it's unusual flatness and insi∣pidity,
but extoll the little flavour it has, consi∣dering
the time of it's vegetation.</P>
<P>AN extemporaneous poet, therefore, is to be
judged, as we judge a race-horse; not by the
gracefulness of his motion, but the time he takes
to finish his course. The best critick upon earth
may err in determining his precise degree of
merit, if he have neither a stop-watch in his
hand, nor a clock within his hearing.</P>
<P>To be a little more serious. An extempora∣neous
piece ought to be examined by a compound
ratio, or a medium compounded of it's real worth,
and the shortness of the time that is employed
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
in it's production. By this rule even Virgil's
poem may be in some sort deemed extemporaneous,
as the time he took to perfect so extraordinary
a composition, considered with it's real worth, ap∣pears
shorter than the time employed to write the
disticks of Cosconius.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I cannot allow this title
to the flashes of my friend S—in the maga∣gazine,
which have no sort of claim to be called
verses, beside their instantaneity.</P>
<P>HAVING ever made it my ambition to see my
writings distinguished for something poignant,
unexpected, or, in some respects, peculiar; I
have acquired a degree of fame by a firm adhe∣rence
to the Concetti. I have stung folks with
my epigrams, amused them with acrosticks, puzzled
them with rebus's, and distracted them with rid∣dles.
It remained only for me to succeed in the
Impromptu, for which I was utterly disquali∣fied
by a whoreson slowness of apprehension.</P>
<P>STILL desirous, however, of the immortal
honor to grow distinguished for an extempore, I
petioned Apollo to that purpose in a dream.
His answer was as follows, “That whatever
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
piece of wit, either written or verbal, makes
any pretence to merit, as of extemporaneous
production, shall be said or written within the
the time that the author supports himself on
one leg. That Horace had explained his
meaning, by the phrase STANS PEDE IN UNO.
And forasmuch as one man may persevere in
the posture longer than another, he would
recommend it to all candidates for this extra∣ordinary
accomplishment, that they would ha∣bituate
themselves to study in no other attitude
whatsoever.”</P>
<P>METHOUGHT I received his answer with the
utmost pleasure as well as veneration; hoping
that, however I was debarred of the acumen
requisite for an extempore, I might learn to
weary out my betters in standing on one leg.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>AN HUMOURIST.</HEAD>
<P>TO form an estimate of the proportion which
one man's happiness bears to another's,
we are to consider the mind that is allotted him
with as much attention, as the circumstances. It
were superfluous to evince that the same objects
which one despises, are frequently to another
the substantial source of admiration. The man
of business and the man of pleasure are to each
other mutually contemptible, and a blue garter
has less charms for some, than they can discover
in a butterfly. The more candid and sage ob∣server
condemns neither for his pursuits, but for
the derision he so profusely lavishes upon the
disposition of his neighbour. He concludes that
schemes infinitely various were at first intended
for our pursuit and pleasure; and that some find
their account in heading a cry of hounds, as
much as others in the dignity of Lord Chief∣Justice.</P>
<P>HAVING premised thus much, I proceed to give
some account of a character which came within
the sphere of my own observation.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25"/>
NOT the entrance of a cathedral, not the sound
of a passing bell, not the furs of a magistrate, nor
the sables of a funeral were fraught with half
the solemnity of face!</P>
<P>NAY so wonderfully serious was he observed
to be on all occasions, that it was found hardly
possible to be otherwise in his company. He
quashed the loudest tempest of laughter, when∣ever
he entered the room, and men's features
though ever so much roughened, were sure to
grow smooth at his approach.</P>
<P>THE man had nothing vitious, or even ill∣natured
in his character; yet he was the dread
of all jovial conversation; the young, the gay
found their spirits fly before him. Even the
kitten and the puppy, as it were by instinct,
would forego their frolicks, and be still. The
depression he occasioned was like that of a damp,
or vitiated air. Unconscious of any apparent
cause you found your spirits sink insensibly: And
were any one to sit for the picture of ill-luck, it
is not possible the painter could select a more
proper person.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26"/>
YET he not fail to boast of a superior share
of reason, even for the want of that very faculty,
risibility, with which it is supposed to be always
joined.</P>
<P>INDEED he acquired the character of the most
ingenious person of his country, from this medita∣tive
temper. Not that he had ever made any
great discovery of his talents; but a few oracular
declarations, joined with a common opinion that
he was writing somewhat for posterity, compleated
his reputation.</P>
<P>NUMBERS would have willingly depretiated
his character, had not his known sobriety and re∣puted
sense deterred them.</P>
<P>HE was one day overheard at his devotions,
returning his most fervent thanks for some parti∣cularities
in his situation which the generality of
mankind would have but little regarded.</P>
<P>ACCEPT, said he, the gratitude of thy most
humble, yet most happy creature, not for silver
or gold, the tinsel of mankind, but for those
amiable peculiarities which thou hast so graci∣ously
interwoven both with my fortune, and my
complexion: For those treasures so well adapted
to that frame of mind thou hast assigned me.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="27"/>
THAT the surname which had descended to
me is liable to no pun.</P>
<P>THAT it runs chiefly upon vowels and liquids.</P>
<P>THAT I have a picturesque countenance ra∣ther
than one that is esteemed of regular fea∣tures.</P>
<P>THAT there is an intermediate hill, intercept∣ing
my view of a nobleman's seat, whose ill∣obtained
superiority I cannot bear to recollect.</P>
<P>THAT my estate is over-run with brambles,
resounds with cataracts, and is beautifully va∣ried
with rocks and precipices, rather than an'
even cultivated spot, fertile of corn, or wine, or
oil; or those kinds of productions in which the
sons of men delight themselves.</P>
<P>THAT as thou dividest thy bounties impar∣tially;
giving riches to one, and the contempt
of riches to another, so thou hast given me, in
the midst of poverty, to despise the insolence of
riches, and by declining all emulation that is
founded upon wealth, to maintain the dignity
and superiority of the muses.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28"/>
THAT I have a disposition either so elevated
or so ingenuous, that I can derive to myself
amusement from the very expedients and con∣trivances
with which rigorous necessity furnishes
my invention.</P>
<P>THAT I can laugh at my own follies, foibles,
and infirmities; and that I do not want infirmities
to employ this disposition.</P>
<P>THIS poor gentleman caught cold one winter's
night, as he was contemplating, by the side of a
crystal stream, by moonshine. This afterwards
terminated in a fever that was fatal to him. Since
his death I have been favored with the inspection
of his poetry of which I preserved a catalogue
for the benefit of my readers.</P>

it with flowers. The banks became in∣viting
through their coverlets of moss: the vio∣lets
refreshed by the moisture of descending rains
enrich'd the tepid air with their agreeable per∣fumes.
But the shower was past; the sun dis∣persed
the vapours; and the sky was clear and
lucid when Polydore walked forth. He was of
a complexion altogether plain and unaffected; a
lover of the Muses, and beloved by them. He
would oftentimes retire from the noise of mixt
conversation, to enjoy the melody of birds, or
the murmurs of a water-fall. His neighbours
often smiled at his peculiarity of temper; and
he no less, at the vulgar cast of theirs. He
could never be content to pass his irrevocable
time in an idle comment upon a news-paper, or
in adjusting the precise difference of temperature
betwixt the weather of to-day and yesterday.
In short he was not void of some ambition, but
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
what he felt he acknowledged, and was never
averse to vindicate. As he never censured any
one who indulged their humor inoffensively, so he
claimed no manner of applause for those pursuits
which gratify'd his own. But the sentiments he
entertained of honor, and the dignity confered
by royal authority, made it wonderful how he
bore the thoughts of obscurity and oblivion. He
mentioned with applause the youths who by me∣rit
had arrived at station; but he thought that
all should in life's visit leave some token of their
existence, and that their friends might more rea∣sonably expect it from them, than they from their
posterity.</P>
<P>THERE were few, he thought, of talents so ve∣ry
inconsiderable, as to be unalterably excluded
from all degrees of fame: and in regard to such
as had a liberal education, he ever wished that in
some art or science they would be persuaded to
engrave their names. He thought it might be
some pleasure to reflect, that their names would
at least be honoured by their descendents, al∣though
they might escape the notice of such as
were not prejudiced in their favor.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32"/>
WHAT a lustre, said he, does the reputation of
a Wren, a Waller, or a Walsingham, cast upon
their remotest progeny? and who would not wish
rather to be descended from them, than from the
mere carcase of nobility? Yet wherever superb
titles are faithfully offered as the reward of me∣rit,
he thought the allurements of ambition were
too transporting to be resisted. But to return.</P>
<P>POLYDORE, a new inhabitant in a sort of wild
un-inhabited country, was now ascended to the
top of a mountain, and in the full enjoyment of
a very extensive prospect. Before him a broad
and winding valley, variegated with all the charms
of landskip. Fertile meadows, glittering streams,
pendent rocks, and nodding ruins. But these in∣deed
were much less the objects of his attention,
than those distant hills and spires that were al∣most
concealed by one undistinguished azure.
The sea indeed appeared to close the scene, tho'
distant as it was it but little variegated the view.
Hardly indeed were it distinguishable but for the
beams of a descending sun, which at the same
time warned our traveller to return, before the
duskiness and dews of evening had rendered his
walk uncomfortable.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"/>
HE had now descended to the foot of the
mountain, when he remarked an old hermit ap∣proaching
to a little hut, which he had formed
with his own hands, at the very bottom of the
precipice. Polydore all enamoured of the beau∣ties
he had been surveying, could not avoid won∣dering
at his conduct, who, not content with shun∣ning
all commerce with mankind, had contrived as
much as possible to exclude all views of nature.
He accosted him in the manner following. Fa∣ther,
says he, it is with no small surprize, that I
observe your choice of situation, by which you
seem to neglect the most distant and delightful land∣skip
that ever my eyes beheld. The hill beneath
which you have contrived to hide your habitation,
which would have afforded you such a variety
of natural curiosities, as to a person so contem∣plative,
must appear highly entertaining: and as
the cell to which you are advancing is seemingly
of your own contrivance, methinks 'twas proba∣ble
you would so have placed it, as to present
them, in all their beauty, to your eye.</P>
<P>THE Hermit made him this answer. My son,
says he, the evening approaches, and you have
deviated from your way. I would not therefore
detain you by my story, did I not imagine the
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
moon would prove a safer guide to you, than that
setting sun which you must otherwise rely upon.
Enter therefore for a while into my cave, and I
will give you then some account of my adven∣tures
which will solve your doubts perhaps more
effectually than any method I can propose. But
before you enter my lone abode, calculated only
for the use of meditation, dare to contemn super∣fluous
magnificence, and render thyself worthy of
the being I contemplate.</P>
<P>KNOW then, that I owe what the world is
pleased to call my ruin (and indeed justly, were
it not for the use which I have made of it) to an
assured dependence, in a litteral sense, upon con∣fused
and distant prospects: a consideration, which
hath so indeed affected me, that I shall never
henceforth enjoy a landskip that lies at so remote
a distance as not to exhibit all it's parts. And
indeed were I to form the least pretensions to
to what your world calls taste, I might even then,
perhaps contend that a well discriminated land∣skip
was at all times to be preferred to a distant
and promiscuous azure.</P>
<P>I WAS born in the Parish of a nobleman who
arrived to the principal management of the bu∣siness
of the nation. The heir of his family and
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
my self were of the same age, and for some time
school-fellows. I had made considerable advances
in his esteem, and the mutual affection we enter∣tained
for each other, did not long remain unob∣served
by his family or my own. He was sent
early upon his travels, pursuant to a very injudi∣cious
custom, and my parents were sollicited to
consent that I might accompany him. Intimations
were given to my friends, that a person of such
importance as his father might contribute much
more to my immediate promotion, than the ut∣most
diligence I could use in pursuit of it. My
father, I remember, assented with reluctance:
my mother, fired with the ambition of her son's
future greatness, through much importunity
“wrung from him his slow leave.” I, for my
own part, wanted no great persuasion. We made
what is called the greater tour of Europe. We
neither of us, I believe, could be said to want
natural sense, but being banished so early in life,
were more attentive to every deviation from our
own indifferent customs, than to any useful exa∣mination
of their policies or manners. Judge∣ment,
for the most part, ripens very slowly. Fan∣cy
often expands her blossoms all at once.</P>
<P>WE Were now returning home from a six year's
absence; anticipating the caresses of our parents
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
and relations, when my ever-honoured companion
was attacked by a fever. All posfible means of
safety proving finally ineffectual, he accosted me
in one of his lucid intervals as follows.</P>
<P>ALAS! my Clytander! my life, they tell me, is
of very short continuance. The next paroxysm
of my fever will probably be conclusive.</P>
<P>THE prospect of this sudden change does not
allow me to speak the gratitude I owe thee;
much less to reward the kindness on which it is
so justly grounded. Thou knowest I was sent
away early from my parents, and the more rati∣onal
part of my life has been passed with thee
alone. It cannot be but they will prove sollici∣tous
in their enquiries concerning me. Thy nar∣rative
will awake their tenderness, and they can∣not
but conceive some for their son's companion
and his friend. What I would hope is that they
will render thee some services, in place of those
their beloved son intended thee, and which I can
unfeignedly assert, would have been only bound∣ed
by my power. My dear companion! farewel.
All other temporal enjoyments have I banished
from my heart; but friendship lingers long, and
'tis with tears I say farewell.—</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="37"/>
MY concern was truly so great, that, upon my
arrival in my native country, it was not at all
encreased by the consideration that the nobleman
on whom my hopes depended, was removed from
all his places. I waited on him; and he appear∣ed
sensibly grieved that the friendship he had
ever professed could now so little avail me. He
recommended me however to a friend of his that
was then of the successful party, and who, he
was assured, would, at his request, assist me to the
utmost of his power. I was now in the prime
of life, which I effectually consumed upon the
empty forms of court-attendance. Hopes arose
before me like bubbles upon a stream; as quick
succeeding one another, as superficial and as vain.
Thus busyed in my pursuit, and rejecting the
assistance of cool examination, I found the win∣ter
of life approaching, and nothing procured to
shelter or protect me when my second patron
dyed. A race of new ones appeared before me,
and even yet kept my expectations in play. I
wished indeed I had retreated sooner, but to re∣tire
at last unrecompenced, and when a few
months attendance might happen to prove suc∣cessful,
was beyond all power of resolution.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="38"/>
HOWEVER after a few years more attendance,
distributed in equal proportions upon each of
these new patrons, I at length obtained a place
of much trouble and small emolument. On the
acceptance of this, my eyes seemed open all at
once. I had no passion remaining for the splen∣dor
which was grown familiar to me, and for ser∣vility
and confinement I entertained an utter a∣version.
I officiated however for a few weeks in
my post, wondering still more and more how I
could ever covet the life I led. I was ever most sin∣cere,
but sincerity clashed with my situation every
moment of the day. In short, I returned home to
a small paternal income, not indeed intending
that austere life in which you at present find me
engaged. I thought to content myself with com∣mon
necessaries, and to give the rest, if aught
remained, to charity, but to avoid all appearance
of singularity. But alas! to my great surprize,
the person who supplied my expences had so far
embroiled my little affairs, that, when my debts,
&amp;c were discharged, I was unable to subsist in
any better manner than I do at present. I grew
at first entirely melancholy; left the country
where I was born, and raised the humble roof
that covers me in a country where I am not
known. I now begin to think myself happy in
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
my present way of life: I cultivate a few vege∣tables
to support me, and the little well there is
a very clear one. I am now an useless individu∣al;
little able to benefit mankind; but a prey to
shame and to confusion, on the first glance of
every eye that knows me. My spirits are indeed
something raised by a clear sky, or a meridian
sun, but as to extensive views of the country, I
think them well enough exchanged for the warmth
and comfort which this vale affords me. Ease is
at least the proper ambition of age, and it is
confessedly my supreme one.</P>
<P>Yet will I not permit you to depart from an
hermit without one instructive lesson. Whatever
situation in life you ever wish or propose for
yourself, acquire a clear and lucid idea of the in∣conveniences
attending it. I utterly contemned
and rejected, after a month's experience, the very
post I had all my life-time been sollicitous to pro∣cure.</P>

<DIV1>
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>On Distinctions, Orders, and Dignities.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject turned upon the nature of
societies, ranks, orders, and distinctions,
amongst men.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN of spirit, and of the popular
faction, had been long declaiming against any
kind of honours that, tended to elevate a body
of people into a distinct species from the rest of
the nation. Particularly titles and blue ribbands
were the object of his indignation. They were,
as he pretended, too invidious an ostentation of
superiority, to be allowed in any nation that
styled itself free. Much was said upon the sub∣ject
of appearances so far as they were counte∣nanced
by law or custom. The bishop's lawn;
the marshal's truncheon; the baron's robe; and
the judge's peruke, were considered only as ne∣cessary
substitutes, where genuine purity, real
courage, native dignity, and suitable penetra∣tion
were wanting to compleat the characters of
those to whom they were assigned.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="41"/>
IT was urged that policy had often effectually
made it a point to dazzle in order to enslave; and
instances were brought of groundless distinctions
born about in the glare of day by certain persons,
who, being stripped of them, would be less
esteemed than the meanest plebeian.</P>
<P>HE acknowledged, indeed, that kings, the
fountains of all political honor, had hitherto
shewn no complaisance to that sex whose softer
dispositions rendered them more excusably fond
of such peculiarities.</P>
<P>THAT in favor of the ladies, he should esteem
himself sufficiently happy in the honor of invent∣ing
one order, which should be styled The most
powerful order of beauties.</P>
<P>THAT their number in Great Britain should
be limited to five thousand; the dignity for ever
to be conferred by the queen alone, who should
be styled sovereign of the order, and the rest the
companions.</P>
<P>THAT the installment should be rendered a thou∣sand
times more ceremonious, the dresses more superb,
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
and the plumes more enormous than those al∣ready
in use amongst the companions of the
garter.</P>
<P>THAT the distinguishing badge of this or∣der
should be an artificial nosegay; to be worn
on the left breast, consisting of a lilly and a
rose, the proper emblems of complexion, and
intermixed with a branch of myrtle, the tree
sacred to Venus.</P>
<P>THAT instead of their shields being affixed
to the stalls appointed for this order, there
should be a gallery erected to receive their pic∣tures
at full length. Their portraits to be taken
by four painters of the greatest eminence, and
he whose painting was preferred, to be styled
A knight of the rose and lilly.</P>
<P>THAT when any person addressed a letter
to a lady of this order, the style should always
be To the Right beautiful Miss or Lady such∣a-one.</P>
<P>HE seemed for some time undetermined whe∣ther
they should forfeit their title upon marriage;
but at length, for many reasons, proposed it
should be continued to them.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43"/>
AND thus far the gentleman proceeded in his
harangue; when it was objected that the queen,
unless, she unaccountably chose to mark out
game for her husband, could take no sort of
pleasure in conferring this honor where it was
most due: That as ladies grew in years, this
epithet of beautifull would burlesque them; and,
in short, that, considering the frailty of beauty,
there was no lasting compliment that could be
bestowed upon it.</P>
<P>At this the orator smiled; and acknowledged
it was true: But asked at the same time, why it
was more absurd to style a lady right beautifull,
in the days of her deformity, than to term a peer
right honorable when he grew a scandal to
mankind?</P>
<P>THAT this was sometimes the case, he said,
was not to be disputed; because titles have been
sometimes granted to a worthless son, in conse∣quence
of a father's enormous wealth most un∣justly
acquired. And few had ever surpassed
in villainy the right honorable the earl of
A—.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44"/>
THE company was a little surprized at the
sophistry of our declaimant. However, it was
replied to, by a person present, that lord
A—'s title being fictitious, no one ought to
instance him to the disadvantage of the p—rage,
who had, strictly speaking, never been of that
number.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
<HEAD>On the same SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>THE declaimant, I before mentioned,
continued his harangue. There are,
said he, certain epithets which so frequently oc∣cur,
that they are the less considered; and which
are seldom or never examined, on account of
the many opportunities of examination that pre∣sent
themselves.</P>
<P>OF this kind is the word Gentleman. This
word, on it's first introduction, was given, I sup∣pose,
to freemen in opposition to vassals; these
being the two classes into which the nation was
once divided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the author is not writing a treatise on the feudal law, but a moral essay, any little inaccurracies, it is to be hoped, will be over-looked by those, who, from several late treatises on this subject, might expect great exactness and precision in a serious discussion of this point.</NOTE>. The freeman was he, who was
possessed of land, and could therefore subsist
without manual labor; the vassal, he, who te∣nanted
the land, and was obliged to his thane
for the necessaries of life. The different man∣ners,
we may presum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that sprung from their
different situations and connexions occasioned the
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
one to be denominated a civilized or gentle per∣sonage;
and the other to obtain the name of a
mere rustic or villain.</P>
<P>BUT upon the publication of crusades, the
state of things was considerably altered: It was
then that every freeman distinguished the shield
which he wore with some painted emblem or
device; and this, in order that his fellow-com∣batants
might attribute to, him his proper ap∣plause,
which, upon account of similar accoutre∣ments,
might be otherwise subject to misappli∣cation.</P>
<P>UPON this there arose a distinction betwixt
freeman and freeman. All which had served, in
those religious wars continued the use of their
first devices, but all devices were not illustrated
by the same pretensions to military glory.</P>
<P>HOWEVER these campaigns were discontinued:
Fresh families sprung up; who, without any pre∣tence
to mark themselves with such devices as
these holy combatants, were yet as desirous of
respect, of estimation, of distinction. It would
be tedious enough to trace the steps by which
money establishes even absurdity. A court of
heraldry sprung up to supply the place of crusade
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
exploits, to grant imaginary shields and trophies
to families that never wore real armour, and it
is but of late that it has been discovered to have
no real jurisdiction.</P>
<P>YET custom is not at once overthrown; and
he is even now deemed a gentleman who has
arms recorded in the Herald's office, and at
the same time follows none, except a liberal em∣ployment.</P>
<P>ALLOWING this distinction, it is obvious to all
who consider, that a churlish, morose, illiterate
clown; a lazy, beggarly, sharping vagabond; a
stupid, lubberly, inactive sot, or pick-pocket,
nay even an highwayman, may be nevertheless a
gentleman as by law established. In short, that
the definition, may, together with others, include
also the filth, the scum, and the dregs of the
creation.</P>
<P>BUT do we not appear to disallow this ac∣count,
when we say “such or such an action was
not done in a gentleman-like manner.” “Such
usage was not the behavior of a gentleman,” and so
forth. We seem thus to insinuate that the appel∣lation
of gentleman regards morals as well as fa∣mily;
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
and that integrity, politeness, generosity,
and affability, have the truest claim to a distinc∣tion
of this kind. Whence then shall we suppose
was derived this contradiction? Shall we say that
the plebeians, having the virtues on their side,
by degrees removed this appellation from the
basis of family to that of merit; which they
esteemed, and not unjustly, to be the true and
and proper pedestal? This the gentry will scarce
allow. Shall we then insist that every thing
great and god-like was heretofore the atchieve∣ment
of the gentry? But this, perhaps, will not
obtain the approbation of the commoners.</P>
<P>To reconcile the difference, let us suppose the
denomination may belong equally to two sorts
of men. The one, what may be styled a gentle∣man
de jure, viz. a man of generosity, politeness,
learning, taste, genius, or affability; in short,
accomplished in all that is splendid, or endeared
to us by all that is amiable on the one side; and
on the other, a gentleman de facto, or what, to
English readers, I would term a gentleman as by
law established.</P>
<P>As to the latter appellation, what is really es∣sential,
or, as logicians would say, “quarto modo
proprium,” is a real, or at least a specious claim
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
to the inheritance of certain coat-armour from a
second or more distant ancestor; and this un∣stained
by any mechanical or illiberal employ∣ment.</P>
<P>WE may discover, on this state of the case,
that, however material a difference this di∣stinction
supposes, yet it is not wholly impracti∣cable
for a gentleman de jure, to render himself
in some sort a gentleman de facto. A certain
sum of money, deposited in the hands of my
good friends Norroy or Rouge-dragon, will con∣vey
to him a coat of arms descending from as
many ancestors as he pleases. On the other
hand, the gentleman de facto may become a gen∣tleman
also de jure, by the acquisition of certain
virtues, which are rarely all of them unattainable.
The latter, I must acknowledge, as the more
difficult task; at least we may daily discover
crowds acquire sufficient wealth to buy gentility,
but very few that possess the virtues which ennoble
human nature, and (in the best sense of the word)
constitute a GENTLEMAN.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
<HEAD>A CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>—HE was a youth so amply furnished
with every excellence of mind, that
he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeined alike capable of acquiring or disre∣garding
the goods of fortune. He had indeed
all the learning and erudition that can be de∣rived
from universities, without the pedantry and
ill manners which are too often their attendants.
What few or none acquire by the most intense
assiduity, he possessed by nature; I mean that
elegance of taste, which disposed him to admire
beauty under its great variety of appearances.
It passed not unobserved by him either in the
cut of a sleeve, or the integrity of a moral action.
The proportion of a statue, the convenience of
an edifice, the movement in a dance, and the
complexion of a cheek or flower afforded him
sensations of beauty; that beauty which inferior
genius's are taught coldly to distinguish; or to
discern rather than feel. He could trace the ex∣cellencies
both of the courtier and the student; who
are mutually ridiculous in the eyes of each other.
He had nothing in his character that could obscure
so great accomplishments, beside the want, the
total want, of a desire to exhibit them. Through
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
this it came to pass, that what would have raised
another to the heights of reputation, was often∣times
in him passed over unregarded. For, in
respect to ordinary observers, it is requisite to
lay some stress yourself, on what you intend
should be remarked by others; and this never
was his way. His knowledge of books had in
some degree diminished his knowledge of the world;
or, rather, the external forms and manners of
it. His ordinary conversation was, perhaps, ra∣ther
too pregnant with sentiment, the usual fault
of rigid students; and this he would in some
degree have regulated better, did not the uni∣versality
of his genius, together with the me∣thod
of his education, so largely contribute to
this amiable defect. This kind of awkwardness
(since his modesty will allow it no better name)
may be compared to the stiffness of a fine piece
of brocade, whose turgescency indeed constitutes,
and is inseparable from it's value. He gave de∣light
by an happy boldness in the extirpation of
common prejudices; which he could as readlly
penetrate, as he could humourously ridicule:
And he had such entire possession of the hearts,
as well as understandings of his friends, that he
could soon make the most surprizing paradoxes
believed and well-accepted. His image, like that
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
of a sovereign, could give an additional value to
the most precious ore; and we no sooner believed
our eyes, that it was he who spake it, than we as
readily believed whatever he had to say. In this
he differed from W—r, that he had the talents
of rendering the greatest virtues un-envied:
Whereas the latter shone more remarkably in
making his very faults agreeable: I mean in
regard to those few he had to exercise his
skill.</P>

<HEAD>ON RESERVE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING an evening's walk with a friend
in the country, among many grave re∣marks,
he was making the following observa∣tion.
There is not, says he, any one quality so
inconsistent with respect, as what is commonly
called familiarity. You do not find one in fifty
whose regard is proof against it. At the same
time it is hardly possible to insist upon such a
deference as will render you ridiculous, if it
be supported by common sense. Thus much
at least is evident, that your demands will be
so successful, as to procure a greater share
than if you had made no such demand. I
may frankly own to you, Leander, that I fre∣quently
derived uneasiness from a familiarity
with such persons as despised every thing they
could obtain with ease. Were it not better,
therefore, to be somewhat frugal of our affabi∣lity,
at least to allot it only to the few persons
of discernment who can make the proper distinc∣tion
betwixt real dignity and pretended: To ne∣glect
those characters, which, being impatient to
grow familiar, are at the same time very far from
familiarity-proof: To have posthumous fame in
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
view, which affords us the most pleasing landskip:
To enjoy the amusement of reading, and the
consciousness that reading paves the way to gene∣ral
esteem: To preserve a constant regularity
of temper, and also of constitution, for the most
part but little consistent with a promiscuous in∣tercourse
with men: To shun all illiterate, though
ever so jovial assemblies, insipid, perhaps, when
present, and upon reflexion painful: To medi∣tate
on those absent or departed friends, who va∣lue
or valued us for those qualities with which
they were best acquainted: To partake with
such a friend as you, the delights of a studious
and rational retirement—Are not these the
paths that lead to happiness?</P>
<P>IN answer to this (for he seemed to feel some
late mortification) I observed, that what we lost
by familiarity in respect, was generally made up
to us by the affection it procured; and that an
absolute solitude was so very contrary to our
natures, that were he excluded from society,
but for a single fortnight, he would be exhila∣rated
at the sight of the first beggar that he
saw.</P>
<P>WHAT follows were thoughts thrown out in
our further discourse upon the subject; without
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
order or connexion, as they occur to my re∣membrance.</P>
<P>SOME reserve is a debt to prudence; as free∣dom
and simplicity of conversation is a debt to
good-nature.</P>
<P>THERE would not be any absolute necessity
for reserve, if the world were honest: Yet, even
then, it would prove expedient. For in order to
attain any degree of deference, it seems necessary
that people should imagine you have more ac∣complishments
than you discover.</P>
<P>IT is on this depends one of the excellencies
of the judicious Virgil. He leaves you some∣thing
ever to imagine: And such is the consti∣tution

<HEAD>ON EXTERNAL FIGURE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a young gentleman in my pa∣rish,
who, on account of his superior e∣quipage,
is esteemed universally more proud and
more haughty than his neighbours. 'Tis frequent∣ly
hinted, that he is by no means entitled to so
splendid an appearance, either by his birth, his
station, or his fortune; and that it is, of con∣sequence,
mere pride that urges him to live be∣yond
his rank, or renders him blind to the know∣ledge
of it. With all this fondness for external
splendor, he is a most affable and ingenious man;
and for this reason I am inclined to vindicate him,
when these things are mentioned to his disad∣vantage.</P>
<P>IN the first place, it is by no means clear, that
dress and equipage are sure signs of pride. Where
it is joined with a supercilious behaviour, it be∣comes
then a corroborative testimony. But this
is not always the case: The refinements of lux∣ury
in equipage or a table, are perhaps as often
the gratifications of fancy, as the consequence of
an ambition to surpass and eclipse our equals.
Whoever thinks that taste has nothing to do here,
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
must confine the expression to improper limits;
assuredly imagination may find it's account in
them, wholly independent of worldly homage
and considerations more invidious.</P>
<P>IN the warmth of friendship for this gentle∣man,
I am sometimes prompted to go further. I
insist, it is not birth or fortune only that give a
person claim to a splendid appearance; that it
may be conferred by other qualifications in which
my friend is acknowledged to have a share.</P>
<P>I HAVE sometimes urged that remarkable inge∣nuity,
any great degree of merit in learning, arts
or sciences, are a more reasonable authority for
a splendid appearance than those which are com∣monly
presumed to be so. That there is some∣thing
more personal in this kind of advantages
than in rank or fortune will not be denied: and
surely there ought to be some proportion observ∣ed
betwixt the case and the thing enclosed. The
propensity of rich and worthless people to ap∣pear
with a splendour upon all occasions, puts
one in mind of the country shop-keeper who
gilds his boxes in order to be the receptacle of
pitch or tobacco. 'Tis not unlike the manage∣ment
at our theatres royal, where you see a piece
of candle honored with a crown.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64"/>
I HAVE generally considered those as privileged
people, who are able to support the character
they assume. Those who are incapable of shin∣ing,
but by dress, would do well to consider that
the contraste betwixt them and their cloathes
turns out much to their disadvantage. 'Tis on
this account I have sometimes observed with plea∣sure
some noblemen of immense fortune to dress
exceedingly plain.</P>
<P>IF dress be only allowable to persons of fami∣ly,
it may then be considered as a sort of family∣livery,
and Jack the groom may with equal just∣ice
pride himself upon the gawdy wardrobe his
master gives him. Nay more—For a gentleman,
before he hire a servant, will require some testi∣mony
of his merit; whereas the master challenges
his own right to splendour, tho' possessed of no
merit at all.</P>
<P>UPON my present scheme of dress, it may seem
to answer some very good purposes. It is then
established on the same foundation, as the judge's
robe and the prelate's lawn. If dress were only
authorized in men of ingenuity, we should, find
many aiming at the previous merit, in hopes of
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
the subsequent distinction. The finery of an
empty fellow would render him as ridiculous as
a star and garter would one never knighted: And
men would use as commendable a diligence to
qualify themselves for a brocaded waistecoat, or a
gold snuff-box, as they now do to procure them∣selves
a right of investing their limbs in lawn or
ermine. We should not esteem a man a coxcomb
for his dress, till, by frequent conversation, we
discovered a flaw in his title. If he was incapa∣ble
of uttering a bon mot, the gold upon his
coat would seem foreign to his circumstances. A
man should not wear a French dress, till he could
give an account of the best French authors; and
should be versed in all the oriental languages
before he should presume to wear a diamond.</P>
<P>IT may be urged, that men of the greatest me∣rit
may not be able to shew it in their dress, on
account of their slender income. But here it
should be considered that another part of the
world would find their equipage so much re∣duced
by a sumptuary law of this nature, that
a very moderate degree of splendour would
distinguish them more than a greater does at
present.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66"/>
WHAT I propose however upon the whole is,
that men of merit should be allowed to dress
in proportion to it; but this with the privilege
of appearing plain, whenever they found an ex∣pediency
in so doing: As a nobleman lays aside
his garter, when he sees no valuable consequence
in the discovery of his quality.</P>

<HEAD>A CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">“Animae nil magnae laudis egentes.“</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an order of persons in the
world whose thoughts never deviate from
the common road; whatever events occur, what∣ever
objects present themselves, their observati∣ons
are as uniform, as though they were the con∣sequence
of instinct. There is nothing places
these men in a more insignificant point of
light, than a comparison of their ideas with the
refinements of some great genius. I shall only
add, by way of reflexion, that it is people of this
stamp, that, together with the foundest health, of∣ten
enjoy the greatest equanimity: their passions,
like dull steeds, being the least apt to endanger,
or misguide them: yet such is the fatality! Men
of genius are often expected to act with most dis∣cretion,
on account of that very fancy which is
their greatest impediment.</P>
<P>I WAS taking a view of Westminster abby, with
an old gentleman of exceeding honesty, but the
same degree of understanding, as that I have de∣scribed.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="68"/>
THERE had nothing passed in our way thither,
beside the customary salutations, and an endea∣vour
to decide with accuracy upon the present
temperature of the weather. On passing over
the threshold, he observed with an air of thought∣fulness,
that it was a brave antient place.</P>
<P>I TOLD him, I thought there was none more
suitable, to moralize upon the futility of all
earthly glory, as there was none which contain∣ed
the ashes of men that had acquired a greater
share of it. On this he gave a nod of appro∣bation,
but did not seem to comprehend me.</P>
<P>SILENCE ensued for many minutes; when hav∣ing
had time to reflect upon the monuments of
men famous in their generations, he stood col∣lected
in himself; assuring me “there was no
sort of excellence could exempt a man from
death.”</P>
<P>I APPLAUDED the justice of his observation;
and said, it was not only my present opinion, but
had been so for, a number of years. “Right,”
says he, “and for my own part I seldom love to
publish my remarks upon a subject, till I have
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had them confirmed to me by a long course of
“experience.”</P>
<P>THIS last maxim, somewhat beyond his usual
depth, occasioned a silence of some few minutes.
The spring had been too much bent to recover
immediately it's wonted vigour. We had taken
some few turns, up and down the left hand ayle,
when he caught sight of a monument somewhat
larger than the rest, and more calculated to make
impression upon an ordinary imagination. As I
remember, it was raised to an ancestor of the D.
of Newcastle. “Well,” says he, with an air of
cunning, “this is indeed a fine piece of work∣manship;”
but I cannot conceive this finery is
“of any signification to the person buryed there.”
I told him, I thought not, and that, under a no∣tion
of respect to the deceased, people were
frequently imposed upon by their own pride and
affectation.</P>
<P>WE were now arrived at the monument of
Sir George Chamberlain; where my friend had
just perused enough to inform him that he was
an eminent physician, when he broke out with
precipitation, and as tho' some important disco∣very
had struck his fancy on a sudden. I listen∣ed
to him with attention, till I found him labour∣ing
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
to insinuate that physicians themselves could
not save their lives when their time was come.</P>
<P>HE had not proceeded many steps from it be∣fore
he beckoned to our Ciceroni. “Friend,”
says he, pointing with his cane, “how long has
that gentleman been dead?” The man set him
right in that particular; after which putting on
a woeful countenance, “ Well,” says he, “to be∣hold
how fast time flies away! 'Tis but a small
time to look back upon, since he and I met at
the Devil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A well known tavern near Temple Bar.</NOTE>. Alas,” continued he, “we shall
never do so again:” Indulging myself with a
pun that escaped me on a sudden, I told him I
hoped not; and immediately took my leave.</P>
<P>THIS old gentleman, as I have since heard,
passed his life chiefly in the country; where it
faintly participated either of pleasure or of pain.
His chief delights indeed were sensual, but those
of the less vigorous kind, an afternoon's pipe,
an evening walk, or a nap after dinner. His death,
which happened, it seems, quickly after, was oc∣casioned
by an uniform application to Bostock's
cordial, whatever his case required. Indeed his
discourse, when any complained of sickness, was
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
a little exuberant in the praises of this noble cath∣artick.
But his distemper proving of a nature
to which this remedy was wholly foreign, as well
as this precluding the use of a more effectual re∣cipe,
he expired, not without the character of a
most considerate person. I find by one part of
his will, he obliged his heir to consume a certain
quantity of ale among his neighbours, on the day
he was born; and by another, left a ring of bells
to the church adjoining to his garden. It looks
as if the old gentleman had not only an aversion
to much reflexion in himself, but endeavoured to
provide against it in succeeding generations.</P>
<P>I HAVE herard that he sometimes boasted that
he was distant relation of Sir Roger de Coverly.</P>

<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>AN OPINION OF GHOSTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the belief of
ghosts and apparitions of persons departed,
has lost ground within these fifty years. This
may perhaps be explained by the general growth
of knowledge; and by the consequent decay of
superstition, even in those kingdoms, where it is
most essentially interwoven with their religion.</P>
<P>THE same credulity which disposed the mind
to believe the miracles of a popish saint, set aside
at once the interposition of reason; and produced
a fondness for the marvellous, which it was the
priest's advantage to promote.</P>
<P>IT may be natural enouch to suppose that a
belief of this kind might spread in the days of
popish infatuation. A belief, as much supported
by ignorance, as the ghosts themselves were in∣debted
to the night.</P>
<P>BUT whence comes it that narratives of this
kind have at any time been given, by per∣sons
of veracity, of judgment, and of learning?
Men neither liable to be deceived themselves,
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
nor to be suspected of an inclination to deceive
others, though it were their interest; nor who
could be supposed to have any interest in it, even
though it were their inclination.</P>
<P>HERE seem's a further explanation wanting than
what can be drawn from superstition.</P>
<P>I Go upon a supposition, that the relations
themselves were false. For as to the arguments
sometimes used in this case, that had there been
no true shilling there had been no counterfeit, it
seems wholly a piece of sophistry. The true
shilling here, should mean the living person; and
the counterfeit resemblance, the posthumous fi∣gure
of him, that either strikes our senses, or
our imagination.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING no ghost then ever appeared, is it
a consequence that no man could ever imagine
that they saw the figure of a person deceased?
Surely those, who say this, little know the force,
the caprice, or the defects of the imagination.</P>
<P>PERSONS after a deba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of liquor, or under
the influence of terror, or in the deliria of a fe∣ver,
or in a fit of lunacy, or even walking in their
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
sleep, have had their brain as deeply impressed
with chimerical representations, as they could
possibly have been, had these representations
struck their senses.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned but a few instances, where∣in
the brain is primarily affected. Others may
be given, perhaps not quite so common, where
the stronger passions, either acute or cronical,
have impressed their object upon the brain; and
this in so lively a manner, as to leave the visio∣nary
no room to doubt of their real presence.</P>
<P>How difficult then must it be to undeceive a
person as to objects thus imprinted? Imprinted
absolutely with the same force as their eyes them∣selves
could have pourtrayed them! And how
many persons must there needs be, who could
never be undeceived at all!</P>
<P>SOME of these causes might not improbably
have given rise to the notion of apparitions:
and when the notion had been once promul∣gated,
it had a natural tendency to produce more
instances.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75"/>
THE gloom of night, that was productive of
terror, would be naturally productive of appa∣rations.
The event confirmed it.</P>
<P>THE passion of grief for a departed friend,
of horror for a murdered enemy, of remorse for
a wronged testator, of love for a mistress killed
by inconstancy, of gratitude to a wife for long
fidelity, of desire to be reconciled to one who
dyed at variance, of impatience to vindicate what
was falsely construed, of propensity to consult
with an adviser, that is lost.—The more faint as
well as the more powerful passions, when bear∣ing
relation to a person deceased, have often, I
fancy, with concurrent circumstances, been suffi∣cient
to exhibit the dead to the living.</P>
<P>BUT, what is more, there seems no other ac∣count
that is adequate to the case as I have stat∣ed
it. Allow this, and you have at once a reason,
why the most upright may have published a fals∣hood,
and the most judicious, confirmed an ab∣surdity.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING then that apparitions of this kind
may have some real use in God's moral govern∣ment:
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
Is not any moral purpose, for which they
may be employed, as effectually answered on my
supposition, as the other? for surely it cannot be
of any importance, by what means the brain re∣ceives
these images. The effect, the conviction,
and the resolution consequent, may be just the
same in either of the cases.</P>
<P>SUCH appears, to me at least, to be the true
existence of apparitions.</P>
<P>THE reasons against any external apparition,
among others that may be brought, are these
that follow.</P>
<P>THEY are, I think, never seen by day; and
darkness being the season of terror and uncer∣tainty,
and the imagination less restrained, they
are never visible to more that one person:
which had more probably been the case, were
not the vision internal.</P>
<P>THEY have not been reported to have ap∣peared
these twenty years. What cause can be
assigned, were their existence real, for so great a
change as their discontinuance?</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="77"/>
THE cause of superstition has lost ground
for this last century; the notion of ghosts has
been, together, exploded: A reason why the
imagination should be less prone to conceive
them; but not a reason why they themselves
should cease.</P>
<P>MOST of those, who relate that these spec∣tres
have appeared to them, have been persons
either dceply superstitious in other respects;
of enthusiastick imaginations, of strong passions
which are the consequence; or else have al∣lowedly
felt some perturbation at the time.</P>
<P>SOME few instances may be supposed, where
the caprice of imagination, so very remarkable
in dreams, may have presented fantasms to those
that waked. I believe there are few but can
recollect some, wherein it has wrought mistakes
at least equal to that of a white-horse for a wind∣ing
sheet.</P>
<P>To conclude. As my hypothesis supposes
the chimera to give terror equal to the reality,
our best means of avoiding it, is to keep a
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
strict guard over our passions—To avoid in∣temperance,
as we would a charnel-house; and
by making frequent appeals to cool reason and
common-sense, secure to ourselves the property
of a well regulated imagination.</P>

<HEAD>ON CARDS. A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>**** WE had passed our evening with some
certain persons famous for their taste, their learn∣ing,
and refinement: But, as ill luck would have
it, two fellows, duller than the rest, had con∣trived
to put themselves upon a level by intro∣ducing
A GAME AT CARDS.</P>
<P>'TIS a sign, said he, the world is far gone in
absurdity, or surely the fashion of cards could be
accounted no small one. Is it not surprizing that
men of sense should submit to join in this idle
custom, which appears originally invented to sup∣ply
it's deficiency? But such is the fatality! im∣perfections
give rise to fashions; and are follow∣ed
by those who do not labour under the defects
that introduced them. Nor is the hoop the only
instance of a fashion invented by those who found
their account in it; and afterwards countenanc∣ed
by others to whose figure it was prejudi∣cial.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="80"/>
How can men who value themselves upon
their reflexions, give encouragement to a practice,
which puts an end to thinking?</P>
<P>I INTIMATED the old allusion of the bow
that acquires fresh vigour by a temporary re∣laxation.</P>
<P>HE answered, this might be applicable, pro∣vided
I could shew, that cards did not require the
pain of thinking; and merely exclude from it,
the profit and the pleasure.</P>
<P>CARDS, if one may guess from their first ap∣pearance,
seem invented for the use of children;
and, among the toys peculiar to infancy, the bells,
the whistle, the rattle, and the hobby-horse,
deserved their share of commendation. By de∣grees,
men, who came nearest to children in
understanding, and want of ideas, grew ena∣moured
of the use of them as a suitable enter∣tainment.
Others also, pleased to reflect on the
innocent part of their lives, had recourse to this
amusement, as what recalled it to their minds.
A knott of villains encreased the party; who
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
regardless of that entertainment which the for∣mer
seemed to draw from cards, considered them
in a more serious light, and made use of them
as a more decent substitute to robbing on the
road, or picking pockets. But men who pro∣pose
to themselves a dignity of character, where
will you find their inducement to this kind of
game? For difficult indeed were it to determine,
whether it appear more odious among sharpers,
or more empty and ridiculous among persons of
character.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, replied I, your men of wit and
fancy may favour this diversion, as giving occa∣sion
for the crop of jest and witticism, which
naturally enough arises from the names and cir∣cumstances
of the cards.</P>
<P>HE said he would allow this as a proper
motive, in case the men of wit and humour would
accept the excuse themselves.</P>
<P>IN short, says he, as persons of ability are
capable of furnishing out a much more agree∣able
entertainment, when a gentleman offers
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
me cards, I shall esteem it as his private opi∣nion
that I have neither sense nor fancy.</P>
<P>I ASKED how much he had lost—His an∣swer
was, he did not much regard ten pieces;
but that it hurt him to have squandered them
away on cards; and that to the loss of a con∣versation,
for which he would have given
twenty.</P>

<HEAD>ON HYPOCRISY.</HEAD>
<P>WERE hypocrites to pretend to no un∣common
sanctity, their want of merit
would be less discoverable. But pretensions of
this nature bring their characters upon the car∣pet.
Those who endeavour to pass for the lights
of the world must expect to attract the eyes of
it. A small blemish is more easily discoverable
in them, and more justly ridiculous than a much
greater in their neighbours. A small blemish
also presents a clue, which very often conducts
us through the most intricate mazes and dark re∣cesses
of their character.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the evidence of this,
how often do we see pretence cultivated in pro∣portion
as virtue is neglected! As religion sinks
in one scale, pretence is exalted in the other.</P>
<P>PERHAPS there is not a more effectual key to the
discovery of hypocrisy than a censorious temper.
The man possessed of real virtue, knows the difficul∣ty
of attaining it; and is, of course, more inclined to
pity others, who happen to fail in the pursuit. The
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
hypocrite, on the other hand, having never trod
the thorny path, is less induced to pity those who
desert it for the flowery one. He exposes the
unhappy victim without compunction, and even
with a kind of triumph; not considering that vice
is the proper object of compassion; or that pro∣pensity
to censure is almost a worse quality than
any it can expose.</P>

about the time of the revolution. She
seemed naturally framed for love, if you were
to judge by her external beauties; but if you
build your opinion on her outward conduct, you
would have deemed her as naturally averse to
it. Numerous were the gar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cons of the polite
and gallant nation, who endeavoured to over∣come
her prejudices, and to reconcile her man∣ners
to her form. Persons of rank, fortune,
learning, wit, youth, and beauty sued to her;
nor had she any reason to quarrel with love for
the shapes in which he appeared before her.
Yet in vain were all applications. Religion was her
only object; and she seemed resolved to pass her
days in all the austerities of the most rigid con∣vent.
To this purpose she sought out an abbess
that presided over a nunnery in Languedoc, a
small community, particularly remarkable for
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
extraordinary instances of self-denial. The ab∣bess
herself exhibited a person in which chasti∣ty
appeared indeed not very meritorious. Her
character was perfectly well known before she
went to preside over this little society. Her
virtues were indeed such as she thought most
convenient to her circumstances. Her fasts
were the effect of avarice, and her devotions of
the spleen. She considered the cheapness of
house-keeping, as the great reward of piety,
and added profuseness to the seven deadly sins.
She knew sack-cloth to be cheaper than brocade,
and ashes, than sweet powder.</P>
<P>HER heart sympathized with every cup that
was broken, and she instituted a fast for each
domestick misfortune. She had converted her
larder into a study, and the greater part of her
library consisted of manuals for fasting-days.
By these arts, and this way of life, she seemed to
enjoy as great a freedom from inordinate de∣sires,
as the persons might be supposed to do
who were favored with her smiles, or her con∣versation.</P>
<P>To this lady was Clelia admitted, and, after the
year of probation assumed the veil.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="86"/>
AMONG many others who had solicited he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
notice, before she became a member of this
convent, was Leander, a young physician of great
learning and ingenuity. His personal accom∣plishments
were at least equal to those of any of
his rivals, and his passion was superior. He urged
in his behalf all that wit, inspired by fondness,
and recommended by person, dress, and equipage,
could insinuate; but in vain. She grew angry
at sollicitations with which she resolved never to
comply, and which she found so difficult to
cvade.</P>
<P>BUT Clelia now had assumed the veil, and
Leander was the most miserable of mortals. He
had not so high an opinion of his fair one's sanctity
and zeal, as some other of her admirers: But he
had a conviction of her beauty, and that alto∣gether
irresistible. His extravagant passion had
produced in him a jealousy that was not easily
eluded.</P>
<Q><L>“At regina dolos—</L>
<L>Quid non sentit amor?”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="83" REF="87"/>
HE had observed his mistress go more frequent∣ly
to her confessor, a young and blooming eccle∣siastic,
than was, perhaps, necessary for so much
apparent purity, or, as he thought, consistent
with it. It was enough to put a lover on the
rack, and if had this effect upon Leander. His
suspicions were by no means lessened, when he
found the convent to which Clelia had given the
preference before all others, was one where this
young friar supplied a confessional chair.</P>
<P>IT happened that Leander was brought to
the abbess in the capacity of a physician, and
he had one more opportunity offered him of be∣holding
Clelia through the grate.</P>
<P>SHE, quite shocked at his appearance, burst
out into a sudden rage, inveighing bitterly against
his presumption, and calling loudly on the name
of the blessed virgin and the holy friar. The
convent was, in short, alarmed; nor was Clelia
capable of being pacified till the good man was
called, in order to allay, by suitable applications,
the emotions raised by this unexpected inter∣view.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="88"/>
LEANDER grew daily more convinced, that it
was not only verbal communications which passed
between Clelia and the friar. This, however,
he did not think himself fully warranted to
disclose, till an accident, of a singular nature,
gave him an opportunity of receiving more ample
testimony.</P>
<P>THE confessor had a favorite spaniel, which
he had lost for some time, and was informed at
length that he was killed, at a village in the neigh∣bourhood,
being evidently mad. The friar was
at first not much concerned; but in a little time
recollected that the dog had snapped his fingers
the very day before his elopement. A physician's
advice was thought expedient on the occasion,
and Leander was the next physician. He told
him with great frankness, that no prescription
he could write, had the sanction of so much ex∣perience
as immersion in sea-water. The friar,
therefore, the next day set forward upon his jour∣ney,
while Leander, not without a mischievous
kind of satisfaction, conveys the following lines
to Clelia.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
<OPENER>My charming CLELIA,</OPENER>
<P>“THOUGH I yet love you to distraction, I
cannot but suspect that you have granted
favors to your confessor, which you might,
with greater innocence, have granted to Le∣ander.
All I have to add is this, that a∣morous
intercourses of this nature, which
you have enjoyed with friar Laurence, put
you under the like necessity with him of seek∣ing
a remedy in the ocean.”</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“Adieu! LEANDER!“</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IMAGINE Clelia guilty, and then imagine her
confusion. To rail was insignificant, and to blame
her physician was absurd, when she found herself
under a necessity of pursuing his advice. The
whole society was made acquainted with the jour∣ney
she was undertaking, and the causes of
it. It were uncharitable to suppose the whole
community under the same constraint with the
unhappy Clelia. However, the greater part
thought it decent to attend her. Some went as
her companions, some for exercise, some for
amusement, and the abbess herself as guardian
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
of her train, and concerned in her society's mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>WHAT use Leander made of his discovery is
not known. Perhaps when he had been success∣ful
in banishing the hypocrite, he did not shew
himself very sollicitous in his endeavors to reform
the sinner.</P>

<HEAD>ON VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY preserves the memory of em∣pires
and of states, with which it neces∣sarily
interweaves that of heroes, kings, and
statesmen. Biography affords a place to the
remarkable characters of private men. There
are likewise other subordinate testimonies,
which serve to perpetuate, at least prolong,
the memories of men, whose characters and
stations give them no claim to a place in story.
For instance, when a person fails of making that
figure in the world, which he makes in the eyes,
of his own relations or himself, he is rarely dig∣nified
any farther than with his picture whilst he
is living, or with an inscription upon his monu∣ment
after his decease. Inscriptions have been
so fallacious, that we begin to expect little from
them beside elegance of style. To inveigh against
the writers, for their manifest want of truth, were
as absurd as to censure Homer for the beauties
of an imaginary character—But even paintings,
in order to gratify the vanity of the person who
bespeaks them, are taught now-a-days, to flatter
like epitaphs.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="92"/>
FALSEHOODS upon a tomb or monument may
be intitled to some excuse in the affection, the gra∣titude,
and piety, of surviving friends. Even
grief itself disposes us to magnify the virtues of
a relation, as visible objects also appear larger
through tears. But the man who through an idle
vanity suffers his features to be bely'd or ex∣changed
for others of a more agreeable make,
may with great truth be said to lose his property
in the portrait. In like manner, if he encourage
the painter to bely his dress, he seems to trans∣fer
his claim to the man with whose station his
assumed trappings are connected.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a bag-piper, whose physiognomy
was so remarkable and familiar to a club he at∣tended,
that it was agreed to have his picture
placed over their chimney-piece. There was
this remarkable in the fellow, that he chose al∣ways
to go barefoot, though he was daily offered
a pair of shoes. However, when the painter had
been so exact as to omit this little piece of dress,
the fellow offered all he had in the world, the
whole produce of three night's harmony, to
have those feet covered in the effigie, which he
so much scorned to cover in the original. Per∣haps
he thought it a disgrace to his instrument
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
to be eternized in the hands of so much appa∣rent
poverty. However, when a person of low
station adorns himself with trophies to which he
has no pretensions to aspire, he should consider
the picture as actually telling a lye to poste∣rity.</P>
<P>THE absurdity of this is evident, if a person
assume to himself a mitre, a blue garter, or a
coronet, improperly; but station may be false∣fied
by other decorations, as well as these.</P>
<P>BUT I am driven into this grave discourse, on
a subject, perhaps, not very important, by a real
fit of spleen. I this morning saw a fellow drawn
in a night-gown of so rich a stuff, that the ex∣pence,
had he purchased such a one, would more
than half have ruined him; and another cox∣comb,
seated by his painter in a velvet chair,
who would have been surprized at the deference
paid him, had he been offered a cushion.</P>
<Q><L>—Gaudent praenomine molles</L>

<P>IT is a very convenient piece of knowledge
for a person upon a journey, to know the com∣pellations
with which it is proper to address those
<PB N="90" REF="94"/>
he happens to meet by his way. Some accuracy
here may be of use to him who would be well
directed either in the length or the tendency of his
road; or be freed from any itinerary difficulties
incident to those who do not know the country.
It may not be indeed imprudent to accost a pas∣senger
with a title superior to what he may ap∣pear
to claim. This will seldom fail to diffuse a
wonderful alacrity in his countenance; and be,
perhaps, a method of securing you from any
mistake of greater importance.</P>
<P>I WAS led into these observations by some sol∣licitudes
I lately underwent, on account of my
ignorance in these peculiarities. Being some∣what
more versed in books, than I can pretend
to be in the orders of men, it was my fortune
to undertake a journey, which I was to perform
by means of enquiries. I had passed a number
of miles without any sort of difficulty, by help
of the manifold instructions that had been given
me on my setting out. At length being some∣thing
dubious concerning my way, I met a per∣son,
whom, from his nightcap and several domestic
parts of dress, I deemed to be of the neigh∣bourhood.
His station of life appeared to me,
to be, what we call a genleman-farmer; a sort of
subaltern character; in respect of which, the
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
world seems not invariably determined. It is in
short what King Charles the Second esteemed the
happiest of all stations; superior to the toilsom
task and ridiculous dignity of constable; and as
much inferior to the intricate practice and invi∣dious
decisions of a justice of peace. “ Honest
man,” says I, “be so good as to inform me whe∣ther
I am in the way to Mirlington?” He repli∣ed,
with a sort of surliness, that he knew nothing
of the matter; and turned away with as much
disgust, as though I had called him rogue or
rascal.</P>
<P>I DID not readily penetrate the cause of his
displeasure, but proceeded on my way with
hopes, to find other means of information. The
next I met was a young fellow, dressed in all the
pride of rural spruceness; and, beside him, walk∣ed
a girl in a dress agreeable to that of her
companion. As I presumed him by no means
averse to appear considerable in the eyes of his
mistress, I supposed a compliment might not be
disagreeable; and enquiring the road to Mirling∣ton,
addressed him by the name of “ Honesty.”
The fellow, whether to shew his wit before his
mistress, or whether he was displeased with my
familiarity, I cannot tell, directed me to follow a
part of my face (which I was well assured could
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
be no guide to me) and that other parts would
follow of consequence.</P>
<P>THE next I met, appeared, by his look and
gait, to stand high in his own opinion. I there∣fore
judged the best way of proceeding was to
adapt my phrase to his own ideas, and saluting
him by the name of Sir, desired to obtain some
insight into my road. My gentleman, without
hesitation, gave me ample instructions for the
rest of my journey.</P>
<P>I PASSED on, musing with myself, why an ap∣pellation
relative to fortune should be preferred
to one founded on merit; when I happened to
behold a gentleman examining a sun-dial in his
garden. “ Friend,” says I, “will you tell me
what a clock it is?” He made me no sort of
answer, and seemed as much dissatisfied with my
openness of temper, as with the confidence I
placed in his—The refusal of an answer in
this case, was not of much importance. I pro∣ceeded
on my way, and happened to meet a very
old woman, whom I determined to accost by the
appellation of Dame; and withal wished her a
good night.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="97"/>
BUT, alas! she seemed so little pleased with
the manner of my address, that she returned
me no manner of thanks for my kind wishes
as to her repose. It is not clear whether my
phrase was faulty, in regard to her dignity, or
in respect of her age. But it is very probable
she might conclude it an impropriety in respect
of both.</P>
<P>I HAD by this time found the inconvenience
of an utter ignorance in rural distinctions. The
future part of my journey afforded me yet
further means of conviction. I was exposed to
the danger of three quicksands, by calling a
girl “sweetheart”, instead of madam; and was
within a foot of rushing down a precipice, by
calling another, “Forsooth,” who might easily
have told me how to avoid it.</P>
<P>IN short, I found myself well or ill used, as
I happened, or not, to suit my salutations to
people's ideas of their own rank. Towards the
last part of my stage, I was to pass a brook,
so much swelled by land-floods, that the proper
way through it was undistinguishable. A well∣dressed
gentleman was passing a bridge on my
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
left-hand. It was here of much importance for
me to succeed in my enquiry. I was, therefore,
meditating within myself which might be the
most endearing of all appellations; and at last
besought him to give me some instructions, under
the name of “Honest Friend.” He was not
seemingly so much pleased, as I assured myself
he would be, and trudged onward without re∣ply.
After this, I had not gone many steps (out
of the path, for so it proved) before I found my∣self
and horse plunged headlong in the brook▪
and my late honest friend in a laughter at our
downfall.</P>
<P>I MADE a shift, however, to recover both my∣self
and horse, and, after a few more difficulties,
arrived at the end of my journey. I have since
made strict enquiry into the due application of
such inferior titles, and may, perhaps, commu∣nicate
them to you, on some future occasion. In
the mean time, you may, if you please, consider
the vast importance of superior titles, when there
is no one so inconsiderable, but there is also a
mind that it can influence.</P>
<P>WHEN you reflect upon this subject, you will,
perhaps, be less severe on your friend—
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
who, you tell me, is now trafficking for this
species of digni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>LEARN to be wise then from others harm,
and do not forget to observe decorum, on every
occasion that you may have to address him for
the future. Pretend no more at the close of
your epistle to be his faithful servant, much
less his affectionate one. Tender your services
with great respect, if you do not chuse to do it
with profound veneration. He will certainly
have no more to do, with sincerity and truth.

<HEAD>ON MODESTY AND
IMPUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man of genius does not print,
he discovers himself by nothing more
than by his abilities in dispute. However let
him shew solidity in his opinions, together with
ease, elegance, and vivacity in his expressions,
yet if an impudent face be found to baffle him,
he shall be judged inferior in other respects. I
mean he will grow cheap in mixed company: for
as to select judges, they will form their opinions
by another scale: with these, a single epistle,
penned with propriety, will more effectually prove
his wit, than an hundred defects in his conversa∣tion
will demonstrate the reverse.</P>
<P>'Tis true there is nothing displays a genius, I
mean a quickness of genius, more than a dispute;
as two diamonds, encountering, contribute to each
other's lustre. But perhaps the odds is much a∣gainst
the man of taste in this particular.</P>
<P>BASHFULNESS is more frequently connected
with good sense, than we find assurance: and
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
impudence, on the other hand, is often the mere
effect of downright stupidity. On this account
the man of genius has as much the advantage of
his antagonist, as a race-horse, carrying a small
weight, has over his rival that bears a larger:
modesty, like the weight to which I allude, not
suffering its owner to exert his real strength;
which effrontery is allowed to do, without lett or
impediment.</P>
<P>IT may be urged, and justly enough, that 'tis
common to be partial to the modest man; and
that diffidence makes good amends for any re∣straint
it lays us under, by the prejudice it gives
every hearer in our favour. But indeed this can
only happen, where it meets with the most inge∣nuous
judges. Otherwise a laugh will carry the
day, with which the ignorant side is generally
best accommodated.</P>
<P>IN order to put these antagonists upon a some∣what
more equal footing, I have invented the fol∣lowing
instrument; for the sole structure and sale
of which, I am not without hopes of procuring
a patent. What I mean, is an artificial laughter.
There are few so little conversant in toys, but
must have seen instruments mechanically framed
to counterfeit the voices of different birds. The
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
quail-pipe is brought to such perfection as even
to delude the very species. The cuckow has
been mimicked with no less accuracy. Would it
not then be an easy matter to represent the laugh
of this empty tribe, which has in itself some∣thing
artificial; and is not more affected than it
is particular. For the convenience of the person;
that bears it, it's dimensions should be so contriv∣ed
as that it might be played on in his pocket.
Does it not seem feasible, that a laughter of this
kind may be brought to answer every pmrpose of
that noise which it resembles? If there be occa∣sion
for an expletive, let the owner seek it in his
fobb; as his antagonist would find his account in
a loud oath or an empty, pun. If there be need
of a good sounding cadence at the close of a
common period, it may not be amiss to harmonize
a sentence by what may be called a finishing∣stroke.
This instrument is so contrived as to pro∣duce
all the variety of an human laugh; and
this variation is to be regulated, not by the na∣ture
of your subject, nor the wit or humour of
a repartee, but by the disposition of the compa∣ny,
and the proper minute for such an interlude.
But to become a master of the said machine,
let the candidate for applause frequent the com∣pany
of vociferous disputants; among whom he
may soon learn how to perform a conversation.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="103"/>
ONE or two of these instruments I have al∣ready
finished, though not indeed to the perfec∣tion,
at which I expect they may soon arrive. A
gentleman visited me t'other day who has the
justest claim that can be, to the use of them;
having nothing in his character that can obscure
the greatest merit, but the greatest modest. I
communicated my invention, desiring him to make
tryal of it, on the first occasion. He did so, and
when I saw him next, gave me leave to publish
the following account of it's efficacy in my next
advertisement. The first time I employed it, said
my friend, was in a sort of controversy with a
beau; who had contrived means by the use of
his snuff-box, to supply both want of language and
of thought. In this manner he prolonged his
argument; and really to the company, which
consisted of ladies, discovered more sagacity with∣out
thinking, than I could do by it's assistance.
I bethought myself immediately of your instru∣ment,
and had recourse to it. I observed in what
part of his discourse he most employed his fin∣gers,
and had suddenly recourse to mine, with
equal emphasis, and significancy. The art was
not discovered, ere I had routed my antagonist;
having seated myself in a dark corner, where my
operations were not discernible. I observed, that
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>
as he found himself more closely pressed, he grew
more and more assiduous in his application to his
snuff-box, much as an otter closely pursued is forc∣ed
to throw up bubbles that show his distress. I
therefore discovered gradually less and less occa∣sion
for speaking; and for thinking, none at all.
I played only a flourish in answer to the argu∣ment
at his finger's ends; and after a while found
him as mortal in this part as in any other. When
his cause was just expiring, after a very long pur∣suit,
and many fruitless turnings and evasions in
the course of it, I sounded<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my instrument with as
much alacrity, as a huntsman does his horn on the
death of an hare.</P>
<P>THE next whom I engaged was a more formi∣dable
disputant; and I own with a sense of gra∣titude
that your instrument alone could render me
a match for him. His strength of argument was
his strength of lungs; and he was, unquestion∣ably,
an able antagonist. However, if your ma∣chine
put me upon a par with him, I think I may
say without vanity, that in point of reason, I had
the upper hand. I shall only add that as it was
habitual for him to answer arguments by voci∣feration,
so it became needless for me to give,
him any answer of a better kind.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="105"/>
THUS far my friend: I do not question but
there will appear artists, that shall undertake to
instruct the diffident, the submissive, and the bash∣full,
how to perform the whole gamut of orato∣rical
and risible musick: and as there is a kind
of humorous laughter, which draws all others
into it's own vortex, I need not here assert that I
would have this branch very much inculcated.</P>
<P>NEITHER is this instrument of importance in
dispute alone, or controversy; but wherever one
man's faculties are more prone to laughter than
another's. Trifles will burst one man's sides,
which will not disturb the features of another;
and a laugh one cannot join, is almost as irksome
as a lamentation. 'Tis like a peal rung after a
wedding; where a whole parish shall be stun∣ned
with noise, because they want that occasion
to rejoice, which the persons at least imagine to
be their lot, that occasioned it. The sounds are
pleasing to their ears, who find them conformable
to their own ideas; but those who are not in tem∣per,
or unconcerned, find them a stupefying re∣petition.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="106"/>
WHEN therefore my mind is not in tune with
another's, what strikes his, will not vibrate on
mine. All I then have to do, is to counterfeit a
laugh; which is an operation as artificial, as the
machine I have been describing,</P>
<P>THE actions of our lives, even those we call
most important, seem as much subject to trifles, as
our very lives themselves. We frame many not∣able
projects in imagination, and promise to, our∣selves
an equal term of life. Tis however in the
power of the minutest accident, to shorten the
one, and disconcert the other. 'Tis with mankind
as with certain fire-engines, whose motion may be
stopped in the midst of it's rapidity, by the inter
position of straw in a particular part of them.</P>
<P>THE following translation from the original
Spanish, will sufficiently illustrate the foregoing
affertion. Don Pedro **** was one of the
principal grandees of his age and country. He
had a genius equal to his birth, and a disposition
remarkably contemplative. 'Twas his custom, on,
this account, to retire from the world at stated
periods, and to indulge himself in all the mazes
of a fine imagination. It happened as he one
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
day sate in his study, that he fixed his eye on a
neighbouring spider. The most trivial object,
(if any natural object can be termed so) served
him frequently for the foundation of some mo∣ral
and sublime reflection. He surveyed the crea∣ture
attentively, and indulged the bias of his
thought, 'till he was lost in the excursions of a
profound reverie. The curious workmanship of
this unregarded animal brought at once into his
mind the whole art of fortification. He observ∣ed
the deficiency of human skill, and that no
cunning could have contrived her so proper an
habitation. He found that no violence could af∣fect
the extremities of her lines, but what was im∣mediately
perceptible, and liable to alarm her at the
center. He observed the road by which she sal∣ly'd
forth, served to convey intelligence from
without, at the same time that it added strength,
and stability to the work within. He was at
once surprized and pleased, with an object which,
although common, he happened not to have be∣held
in the same light, or with the same attenti∣on.
From this instant he bent his thoughts upon,
the advancement of military fortification: And he
often would declare it was this trivial incident,
that gave him a relish for that study, which he
afterwards pursued with such application, and
success.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="108"/>
HE spent in short so much time upon the at∣tainment
of this science, that he grew as capable
of executing any part of it, as speculation alone
could render him. Nothing wanted now, but
practice, to compleat the same of his abilities.
That in short was his next pursuit. He became
desirous of experiencing, what had been so suc∣cessful
in imagination, and to make those mural
sallies, which had been attended there with vic∣tory.
To this end he had little to do, but excite
the ambition of his young monarch; to enforce
by testimony of his friends his qualifications for
the post he sought; and, on the first delivery of
his petition to obtain preferment from the king.</P>
<P>THIS happened to be a time of the profound∣est
tranquillity: little agreeable to a person eager
of glory, furnished with skill and conscious of a∣bilities.
Such was this ingenious noblemen. He
well knew the ambition of princes, and of his
monarch in particular. But he was not acquaint∣ed
with his own. That imperious and subtle
passion, is often most predominant when 'tis least
perceived. When it once prevails in any great
degree, we find our reason grow subservient,

she confirms us in our error; and even
levels the mounds and smooths the obstructions,
which it is her natural province to interpose. This
was the case of Don Pedro. The delicacy of his taste
encreased his sensibility; and his sensibility made him
more a slave. The mind of man, like the finer parts
of matter, the more delicate it is, naturally admits the
more deep and the more visible impressions. The
purest spirits are the soonest apt to take the flame.
Let us therefore be the more candid to him, on ac∣count
of the vivacity of his passions, seduced, as
indeed he was, into very unwarrantable schemes.</P>
<P>HE had in brief conceived a project, to give
his master an universal monarchy, He had cal∣culated
every article, with the utmost labour and
precision, and intended within a few days, to pre∣sent
his project to the king.</P>
<P>SPAIN was then in a state of affluence; had a
large army on foot; together with means and op∣portunities
of raising an immense one. 'Twere
impossible to answer for the possible events, that
might destroy their hopes of such an enter∣prize.
Difficulty often attends the execution of
things the most feasible and well contrived in the∣ory.
But whoever was acquainted with the au∣thor
of this project, knew the posture of affairs
<PB N="106" REF="110"/>
in Europe at that time, the ambition of the prince,
and the many circumstances that conspired to fa∣vour
it, might have thought the project would
have been agreed to, put in practice, and, with∣out
some particular interposition of fortune, been
attended with success—But fortune did not put
herseif to any particular trouble about the
matter.</P>
<P>DON Pedro, big with vast designs, was one day
walking in his fields. He was promised the next
morning an audience of the king. He was pre∣paring
himself for a conversation, which might
prove of so much consequence to all mankind;
when walking thoughtfully along and regardless
of his path, his foot happened to stumble and to
overturn an ant's-nest. He cast his eyes upon
the ground to see the occasion of his mistake,
where he spyed the little animals in the most
miserable confusion. He had the delicacy of
sentiment, to be really sorry for what he had
done; and, putting himself in their condition,
began to reflect upon the consequence. It might
be an age, to them, ere they could recover their
tranquillity. He viewed them with a sort of smile
to find the anxiety they underwent for such pe∣rishable
habitations. Yet he considered that his
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
contempt was only the effect of his own superi∣ority;
and that there might be some created be∣ings
to whom his own species must appear as tri∣fling.
His remark did not cease here. He con∣sidered
his future enterprize, with an eye to
such a race of beings. He found it must appear
to them in a light as disadvantageous, as the am∣bition
and vain-glory of an ant would, to him∣self.
How ridiculous, he said, must this repub∣lick
appear to me, could I discern its actions, as
it has probably many, that are analogous to
those of human nature. Suppose them at con∣tinual
variance about the property of a grain of
sand. Suppose one, that had acquired a few
sands more to his portion—as also one grain of
wheat, and one small particle of barley-flour,
should think himself qualified to tyrannize over
his equals and to lord it, uncontrolled. Consider
him, on this account, not contented to make use
of the numerous legs with which nature has sup∣plied
him, born aloft by a couple of slaves with∣in
the hollow of an husk of wheat, five or six
others, at the same time, attending solemnly upon
the procession. Suppose lastly that among this
people, the prime minister should persuade the
rest to level war upon a neighbouring colony;
and this in order to be stiled the sovereign of two
hillocks, instead of one; while perhaps their
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>
present condition leaves them nothing to wish
beside superfluities. At the same time it is in
the power of the most inconsiderable among man∣kind,
nay of any species of animals superior to
their own, to destroy at once the minister and
the people altogether; This is doubtless very ri∣diculous,
yet this is doubtless my own case; in
respect of many subordinate beings, and very
certainly of the supreme one. Farewell then ye
air-built citadels! Farewell visions of un-solid
glory! Don Pedro will seek no honour of so e∣quivocal
an acceptation, as to degrade his cha∣racter
to a superior species, in proportion as it
exalts him before his own.</P>
<P>SEE here a just conclusion! In short, he found
it so fairly drawn, as immediately to drop his
project, leave the army, and retire: of which
whimsical relation it may be well enough observ∣ed,
that a spider had enslaved the world had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HEAD>UPON ENVY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO A FRIEND, R. G.</HEAD>
<P>WHENCE is it, my friend, that I feel
it impossible to envy you, although here∣after
your qualifications may make whole millions
do so? for, believe me, when I affirm, that I deem
it much more superfluous, to wish you honours
to gratify your ambition, than to wish you
ambition enough, to make your honours satis∣factory.</P>
<P>IT seems an hard case that envy should be
the consequence of merit, at the same time that
scorn so naturally attends the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>want of it. 'Tis
however in some measure perhaps unavoidable
(and perhaps in some sense an useful) passion in
all the most heroic natures; where, refined
through certain strainers, it takes the name of
emulation. 'Tis a pain arising in our breasts, on
contemplation of the superior advantages of ano∣ther:
And its tendency is truly good, under some
certain regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="114"/>
ALL honour, very, evidently, depends upon
comparison; and consequently the more numerous
are our superiors, the smaller portion of it falls
to our share. Considered relatively, we are dwarfs,
or giants; though considered absolutely, we are
neither. However the love of this relative gran∣deur,
is made a part of our natures; and the use
of emulation is to excite our diligence in pursuit
of power, for the sake of beneficence. The in∣stances
of it's perversion are obvious to every
one's observation. A vicious mind, instead of
it's own emolument, studies the debasement of
his superior. A person to please one of this
cast, must needs divest himself of all usefull qua∣lities;
and in order to be beloved, discover no∣thing
that is truely amiable. One may very
safely fix our esteem on those whom we hear
some people depreciate. Merit is to them as
uniformly odious, as the sun itself to the birds
of darkness. An author, to judge of his own
merit, may fix his eye upon this tribe of men;
and suffer his satisfaction to arise in due propor∣tion
to their discontent. Their disapprobation
will sufficiently influence every generous bosom in
his favor: and I would as implicitly give my ap∣plause
to one whom they pull to pieces; as the
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
inhabitants of Pegu worship those, that have
been devoured by apes.</P>
<P>'Tis another perversion of this passion, though
of a less enormous nature, when it merely sti∣mulates
us to rival others in points of no intrin∣sick
worth. To equal others in the useless parts
of learning; to pursue riches for the sake of an
equipage as brilliant; to covet an equal know∣ledge
of a table; to vie in jockey-ship, or cun∣ning
at a bett. These and many othor rivalships,
answer not the genuine purposes of emulation,</P>
<P>I BELIEVE the passion is oftentimes derived
from a too partial view of our own and others ex∣cellencies.
We behold a man possessed of some
particular advantage, and we immediately reflect
upon its deficiency in ourselves. We wait not
to examine what others we have to ballance it.
We envy another man's bodily accomplishments;
when our mental ones might preponderate, would
we put them into the scale. Should we ask our
own bosoms whether we would change situations,
altogether, I fancy self-love would, generally,
make us prefer our own condition. But if our
sentiments remain the same after such an exami∣nation,
all we can justly endeavour is our own
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
real advancement. To meditate his detriment
either in fortune, power, or reputation, at the
same time that it is infamous, has often a tendency
to depress ourselves. But let us confine our emu∣lation
to points of real worth; to riches, power,
or knowledge; only that we may rival others in
beneficence.</P>

<HEAD>A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>INGENIOUS was the device of those celebrated
worthies, who, for the more effectual pro∣mulgation
of their well-grounded maxims, first
pretended to divine inspiration. Peace be to their
manes; may the turf lie lightly on their breast;
and the verdure over their grave, be as perpe∣tual
as their memories! Well knew they, ques∣tionless,
that a proceeding of this nature, must
afford an excuse to their modesty, as well as add
a weight to their instructions. For, from the be∣ginning
of time, if we may believe the histories
of the best repute, man has ever found a delight
in giving credit to surprizing lies. There was
indeed necessary a degree of credit, previous to
this delight; and there was necessary a delight,
in order to enforce any degree of credit. But so
it was, that the pleasure rose, in a proportion to
the wonder; and if the love of wonder was, but
gratified, no matter whether the tale was founded
upon a witch or an Egeria; on a rat, a pigeon, the
pummel of a sword, a bloated sibyll, or a three∣foot
stool.</P>

OF all writers that bear any resemblance to
these originals, those who approach the nearest
are such, as describe their extraordinary dreams
and visions. Of ostentation we may not, perad∣venture,
accuse them, who claim to themselves
no other than the merit of spectators. Of want
of abilities we must not censure them; when we
are given to know that their imagination had no
more part in the affair, than a whited wall has,
in those various figures, which some crafty artist
represents thereon.</P>
<P>THE first meditation of a solitary, is the be∣haviour
of men in active life. Hapless species,
I cry'd, how very grossly art thou mistaken!
How very supine, while youth permits thee to
gain the prize of virtue by restraint! How very
resolute when thine age leaves nothing to restrain
thee! Thou givest a loose to thine inclinations,
'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill they lose their very being; and, like a lamp
over-whelmed with oil, are extinguished by in∣dulgence.
What folly to dream of virtue, when
there is no longer room for self-denial; or, when
the enemy expires by sickness, to demand the
honour of a triumph!—Musing upon this sub∣ject,
I fell into a profound slumber; and the
<PB N="115" REF="119"/>
vision with which it furnished me, shall supply
materials for this essay.</P>
<P>I WAS, methought, transported into a winding
valley, on each side of whose area, so far as my
eye could see, were held up (in the manner of a
picture) all the pleasing objects either of art or
nature. Hills rose one beyond another, crowned
with trees, or adorned with edifices; broken
rocks contrasted with lawns, and foaming rivers
poured headlong over them; gilded spires en∣livened
even the sun-shine; and lonesome ruins,
by the side of woods, gave a solemnity to the
shade. It would be endless, or rather impossible,
to give an idea of the vast variety. It seemed,
as though people of whatever inclinations might
here meet with their favorite object.</P>
<P>WHILE I stood amazed, and even confounded,
at so astonishing a landskip; an old man ap∣proached
towards me, and offered his assistance
in alleviating my surprize. You observe, says
he, in the middle path, a train of sprightly female
pilgrims<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Passions.</NOTE>, conducted by a matron<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reason.</NOTE> of a graver
cast. She is habited, as you may observe, in a
robe far more plain and simple than that of any
<PB N="116" REF="120"/>
amidst her followers. It is her province to re∣strain
her pupils, that the objects glittering on
each side may not seduee them to make excur∣sions,
from which they scarce ever find their
right way again. You may not, perhaps, suspect
the gulphs and precipices that lie intermixed
amidst a scenery so delightful to the eye. You
see, indeed, at a considerable distance, the gilt
dome of a temple, raised on columns of the
whitest marble. I must inform you, that within
this temple resides a lady<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virtue.</NOTE>, weaving wreaths of
immortal amaranth for that worthy matron, if
she exert her authority; and, as their obedience
is more or less entire, she has also garlands of
inferior lustre to recompence the ladies in her
train.</P>
<P>YOUR own sagacity, added he, will supply the
place of farther instructions, and then vanished
in an instant.</P>
<P>THE space before me, as it appeared, was
crossed by four successive rivers. Over these
were thrown as many bridges, and beyond each
of these streams the ground seemed to vary it's
degree of lustre, as much as if it had lain under
<PB N="117" REF="121"/>
a different climate. On the side of each of these
rivers appeared, as I thought, a receptacle for
travellers; so that the journey seemed to be por∣tioned
into four distinct stages. It is possible that
these were meant to represent the periods of a
man's life; which may be distinguished by the
names of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age.</P>
<P>DURING the first stage, our travellers pro∣ceeded
without much disturbance. Their excur∣sions
were of no greater extent than to crop a
primrose, or a daisy, that grew on the way-side:
And in these their governess indulged them. She
gave them but few checks, and they afforded her
but little occasion. But when they arrived at the
second period, the case then was greatly altered.
The young ladies grew visibly enamoured of the
beauties on each side; and the governess began
to feel a consciousness of her duty to restrain
them. They petitioned clamorously to make one
short excursion, and met with a decent refusal.
One of them, that visibly shewed herself the
greatest vixen and romp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> amongst them, had a
thousand arts and stratagems to circumvent her
well-meaning governess. I must here mention,
what I remarked afterwards, that some of the
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
pupils felt greater attractions in one stage; and
some in another. And the scene before them
being well variegated with mossy banks, and purl∣ing
streams, frisking lambs, and piping shepherds;
inspired a longing that was inexpressible, to one
that seemed of an amorous complexion. She re∣quested
to make a short digression; pointed to the
band of shepherds dancing; and, as I observed,
presented a glass, through which the matron
might distinctly view them. The governess ap∣plied
the glass, and it was wonderful to trace the
change it effected. She, who before had with
much constancy opposed the prayers of the peti∣tioner,
now began to lean towards her demands;
and, as if she herself were not quite indifferent
to the scene of pleasure she had beheld, grew
remiss in her disipline; softened the language
of dissent; and with a gentle reprimand, suffered
her pupil to elope. After this, however, she
winked her eyes; that she might not at least bear
testimony to the step she did not approve. When
the lady had gratified her curiosity, she returned
for the present; but with an appetite more in∣flamed,
and more impatient to repeat her frolick.
The governess appeared uneasy, and to repent
of her own compliance; and reason good she
had; considering the confidence it gave her pupil,
and the weight it took from her own authority.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125"/>
THEY were not passed far from the second
stage of their journey, ere they all determined
to rebel, and submit to the tyranny of their
leader no longer.</P>
<P>ANOTHER now took the lead; and seizing an
embroidered handkerchief, compleatly hood∣winked
the directress. All now was tumult,
anarchy, disagreement, and confusion. They
led their guide along, blindfold, not without
proposals of downright murder. They soon lost
sight of the regular path, and strode along with
amazing rapidity I should, however, except
some few<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The virtuoso-passion.</NOTE> who, being of a complexion naturally
languid, and thus deprived of their protectress,
had neither constancy to keep the road, nor spirit
enough to stray far from it. These found the
utmost of their inclination gratified, in treasuring
up shells from the banks of the river, scooping
fossils from the rocks, or preserving plants that
grew in the valley. A moth or butterfly afforded
them a chace, and a grub or beetle was a suitable
companion. But to return to the vagabonds.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126"/>
THE lady that performed the feat of blinding
her governess, for a time, bore the chief rule;
and held the rest in a state of servitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE>. She
seemed to be indeed formed for that power and
grandeur, which was her delight; being of a sta∣sture
remarkably tall, with an air of dignity in
her countenance. Not but others would some∣times
insist upon some temporary gratification.
As they shaped their way to a great city,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Indolence</NOTE> one
would loll and loiter on a bed of roses; another
would join the dance of shepherds, and sometimes
retire with<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gallantry</NOTE> one into the covert. A<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Avarice.</NOTE> third
would not move a step further, till she had ga∣thered
some ore that was washed from the moun∣tains.
When they entered the city, their dissi∣pation
was yet more observable.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ebriety.</NOTE> One intoxi∣cated
herself with cordials;<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Pride and Vanity.</NOTE> another went in
quest of lace and. equipage. The<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE> lady, how∣ever,
at this time most enterprizing, and who
(as I mentioned before) had given such a turn to
their affairs, discovered a strange fondness herself
for lawn and ermine, embroidered stars, and
golden collars. However difficult it seemed to
reach them, or how little necessary soever they
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
seemed to happiness, these alone engaged her
attention; and to these alone her hopes aspred.
Nay she went so far, as, in failure of these, to
resolve on misery and wilful wretchedness.</P>
<P>SHE at length succeeded, at least so far, as
to find how little they enhanced her happiness;
and her former compeers having ruined their
constitutions, were once again desirous to have
their queen reign over them. In short, their
loyalty regained the ascendant; insomuch, that
with one consnt they removed the bandage from
her eyes, and vowed to obey her future di∣rections.</P>
<P>SHE promised to procure them all the happiness
that was consistent with their present state; and
advised them all to follow her towards the path
they had forsaken.</P>
<P>OUR travellers, in a little time after this,
passed over the bridge that introduced them to
their closing stage. The subjects, very orderly,
repentant, and demissive: The governess, more
rigid and imperious than ever. The former,
withered, decrepid, languishing; the latter, in
greater vigour, and more beautiful than before.
Time appeared to produce in her, a very opposite
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
effect to that it wrought in her companions. She
seemed, indeed, no more that easy ductile crea∣ture,
insulted and borne away by the whims of
her companions. She appeared more judicious
in the commands she gave, and more rigorous in
the execution. In short, both her own activity,
and the supine lethargy of those whom she con∣ducted,
united to make way for her unlimited
authority. Now, indeed, a more limited rule
might have secured obedience, and maintained
a regularity. The ladies were but litttle struck
with the glare of objects on each side the way.
One alone I must except whom I beheld look
wishfully, with a retorted eye, towards the golden
ore washed down by the torrents. The gover∣ness
represented, in the strongest terms, that
these materials could not be imported into the
realms they were about to enter. That, were
this even the case, they could be there of no im∣portance.
However she had not extirpated the
biass of this craving dame, when they approach∣ed
the temple to which I formerly alluded.</P>
<P>THE temple stood upon a lofty hill, half en∣circled
with trees of never-fading verdure. Be∣tween
the milk-white columns (which were of
the Dorick order, the bases gilt, as also the ca∣pitals)
a blaze of glory issued, of such superior
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
lustre, that none beside the governess was able
to approach it. She, indeed, with a dejected
countenance, drew near unto the goddess; who
gently waved her hand, in the way of salutation.</P>
<P>THE matron seemed less dazled, than delighted,
with her excessive beauty. She accosted her
with reverence, and with much diffidence began
to mention their pretension to her favor. “She
must own, she had been too remiss in the be∣ginning
of her government; she hoped it would
be attributed to inexperience in the subtle wiles
of her fellow-travellers. She flattered herself,
that her severity towards the conclusion of her
journey might in some sort make attonement
for her misbehaviour in the beginning. Lastly,
that she sometimes found it impossible to hear
the dictates of the Goddess amid the clamours
of her pupils, and the din of their persuasions.”</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To this the Goddess made reply.</OPENER>
<P>“ You have heard, said she, no doubt, that
the favors I bestow, are by no means consistent
with a state of inactivity. The only time when
you were allowed an opportunity to deserve
them, was the time when your pupils were the
most refractory and perverse. The honours
you expect in my court are proportioned to the
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
difficulty of a good undertaking. May you,
hereafter, partake them, in reward of your
more vigorous conduct: For the present you
are little entitled to any recompence from me.
As to your pupils, I observe, they have passed
seatence upon themselves.”</P>
<P>AT this instant of time the bell rung for sup∣per,
and awaked me; I found the gardener by
my side, prepared to plant a parcel of trees;
and that I had slumbered away the hours, in
which I should have given him suitable direc∣tions.</P>

<HEAD>UNCONNECTED THOUGHTS
ON GARDENING.</HEAD>
<P>GARDENING may be divided into
three species—kitchen-gardening—par∣terre-gardening—and
landskip, or picturesque∣gardening:
which latter is the subject intended
in the following pages—It consists in pleasing the
imagination by scenes of grandeur, beauty, or
variety. Convenience merely has no share here;
any farther than as it pleases the imagination.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the division of the pleasures of ima∣gination,
according as they are struck by the
great, the various, and the beautiful, may be ac∣curate
enough for my present purpose: why each
of them affects us with pleasure may be traced
in other authors. See Burke, Hutchinson, Ge∣rard.
The theory of agreeable sensations, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GARDEN-SCENES may perhaps be divided into the su∣blime, the beautifull, and the melancholy or pensive; to which last I know not but we may assign a middle place betwixt the former two, as being in some sort composed of both. See Burke's sublime, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132"/>
THERE seems however to be some objects
which afford a pleasure not reducible to either of
the foregoing heads. A ruin, for instance, may
be neither new to us, nor majestick, nor beau∣tiful,
yet afford that pleasing melancholy which
proceeds from a reflexion on decayed magnifi∣cence.
For this reason an able gardiner should
avail himself of objects, perhaps, not very strik∣ing;
if they serve to connect ideas, that convey
reflexions of the pleasing kind.</P>
<P>OBJECTS should indeed be less calculated to
strike the immediate eye, than the judgment or
well-formed imagination; as in painting.</P>
<P>IT is no objection to the pleasure of novelty,
that it makes an ugly object more disagreeable.
It is enough that it produces a superiority be∣twixt
things in other respects equal. It seems,
on some occasions, to go even further. Are there
not broken rocks and rugged grounds, to which
we can hardly attribute either beauty or gran∣deur,
and yet when introduced near an extent
of lawn, impart a pleasure equal to more shape∣ly
scenes? Thus a series of lawn, though ever
so beautiful, may satiate and cloy, unless the eye
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
passes to them from wilder scenes; and then they
acquire the grace of novelty.</P>
<P>VARIETY appears to me to derive good part
of it's effect from novelty; as the eye, passing
from one form or color, to a form or color of a
different kind, finds a degree of novelty in it's
present object which affords immediate satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P>VARIETY however, in some instances, may be
carried to such excess as to lose it's whole effect.
I have observed ceilings so crammed with stucco∣ornaments;
that, although of the most different
kinds, they have produced an uniformity. A
sufficient quantity of undecorated space is neces∣sary
to exhibit such decorations to advantage.</P>
<P>GROUND should first be considered with an
eye to it's peculiar character: whether it be the
grand, the savage, the sprightly, the melancho∣ly,
the horrid, or the beautifull. As one or
other of these characters prevail, one may some∣what
strengthen it's effect, by allowing every
part some denomination, and then supporting it's
title by suitable appendages—For instance, The
lover's walk may have assignation seats, with pro∣per
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
mottoes—Urns to faithfull lovers—Trophies,
garlands, &amp;c. by means of art.</P>
<P>WHAT an advantage must some Italian seats
derive from the circumstance of being situate
on ground mentioned in the classicks? And, even
in England, wherever a park or garden happens
to have been the scene of any event in history,
one would surely avail one's self of that circum∣stance,
to make it more interesting to the ima∣gination.
Mottoes should allude to it, columns,
&amp;c. record it; verses moralize upon it; and cu∣riosity
receive it's share of pleasure.</P>
<P>IN designing a house and gardens, it is happy
when there is an opportunity of maintaining a
subordination of parts; the house so luckily
placed as to exhibit a view of the whole design.
I have sometimes thought that there was room
for it to resemble an epick or dramatick poem.
It is rather to be wished than required, that the
more striking scenes may succeed those which are
less so.</P>
<P>Taste depends much upon temper. Some pre∣fer
Tibullus to Virgil, and Virgil to Homer—Hagley
to Persfield, and Persfield to the Welsh.
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
mountains. This occasions the different prefer∣ences
that are given to situations—A garden
strikes us most, where the grand, and the plea∣sing
succeed, not intermingle, with each other.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, however, the sublime has general∣ly
a deeper effect than the merely beautiful.</P>
<P>I USE the words landskip and prospect, the for∣mer
as expressive of home scenes, the latter of
distant images. Prospects should take in the blue
distant hills; but never so remotely, that they be
not distinguishable from clouds. Yet this mere
extent is what the vulgar value.</P>
<P>LAND SKIP should contain variety enough to
form a picture upon canvas; and this is no bad
test, as I think the landskip painter is the gardi∣ner's
best designer. The eye requires a sort of
ballance here; but not so as to encroach upon
probable nature. A wood, or hill, may ballance
a house or obelisk; for exactness would be dis∣pleasing.
We form our notions from what we
have seen; and though, could we comprehend the
universe, we might perhaps find it uniformly re∣gular;
yet the portions that we see of it, habi∣tuate
our fancy to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136"/>
THE eye should always look rather down upon
water: Customary nature makes this requisite.
I know nothing more sensibly displeasing than
Mr. T—'s flat ground betwixt his terras and
his water.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to account for the fondness of
former times for strait-lined avenues to their
houses; strait-lined walks through their woods;
and, in short, every kind of strait-line; where
the foot is to travel over, what the eye has done
before. This circumstance, is One objection.
Another, somewhat of the same kind, is the re∣petition
of the same object, tree after tree, for
a length of way together. A third is, that this
identity is purchased by the loss of that variety,
which the natural country supplies every where;
in a greater or less degree. To stand still and
survey such avenues, may afford some slender
satisfaction, through the change derived from
perspective; but to move on continually and find
no change of scene in the least attendant on our
change of place, must give actual pain to a per∣son
of taste. For such an one to be condemned
to pass along the famous vista from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Montesquieu, on Taste.</NOTE> Moscow
to Petersburg, or that other from Agra to Lahor
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
in India, must be as disagreeable a sentence, as
to be condemned to labour at the gallies. I
conceived some idea of the sensation he must
feel, from walking but a few minutes, immured,
betwixt Lord D—'s high-shorn yew-hedges;
which run exactly parallel, at the distance of a∣bout
ten feet; and are contrived perfectly to ex∣clude
all kind of objects whatsoever.</P>
<P>WHEN a building, or other object has been
once viewed from its proper point, the foot should
never travel to it by the same path, which the
eye has travelled over before. Lose the object,
and draw nigh, obliquely.</P>
<P>THE side-trees in vistas should be so circum∣stanced
as to afford a probability that they grew
by nature.</P>
<P>RUINATED structures appear to derive their
power of pleasing, from the irregularity of sur∣face,
which is VARIETY; and the latitude they
afford the imagination, to conceive an enlarge∣ment
of their dimensions, or to recollect any
events or circumstances appertaining to their pris∣tine
grandeur, so far as concerns grandeur and
solemnity. The breaks in them should be as
bold and abrupt as possible,—If mere beauty be
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
aimed at (which however is not their chief ex∣cellence)
the waving line, with more easy trans∣itions,
will become of greater importance—Events
relating to them may be simulated by numberless
little artifices; but it is ever to be remembered,
that high hills and sudden descents are most
suitable to castles; and fertile vales, near wood
and water, most imitative of the usual situation
for abbeys and religious houses; large oaks, in
particular, are essential to these latter.</P>
<P><Q><L>Whose branching arms, and reverend height</L>
<L>Admit a dim religious light.</L></Q>
A cottage is a pleasing object partly on account
of the variety it may introduce; on account of
the tranquillity that seems to reign there; and
perhaps, (I am somewhat afraid) on account of
the pride of human nature.</P>
<Q>Longi alterius spectare laborem.</Q>
<P>In a scene presented to the eye, objects should
never lie so much to the right or left, as to give it
any uneasiness in the examination. Sometimes,
however, it may be better to admit valuable objects
even with this disadvantage. They should else
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
never be seen beyond a certain angle. The eye
must be easy, before it can be pleased.</P>
<P>No mere slope from one side to the other can
be agreeable ground: The eye requires a bal∣lance—i. e.
a degree of uniformity: but this may
be otherwise effected and the rule should be un∣derstood
with some limitation.</P>
<Q><L>—Each alley has it's brother,</L>
<L>And half the plat-form just reflects the other.</L></Q>
<P>LET US examine what may be said in favour
of that regularity which Mr. Pope exposes.
Might he not seemingly as well object to the
disposition of an human face, because it has an
eye or cheek, that is the very picture of it's
companion? Or does not providence who has
observed this regularity in the external structure
of our bodies and disregarded it within, seem to
consider it as a beauty? The arms, the limbs,
and the several parts of them correspond, but
it is not the same case with the thorax and the
abdomen. I believe one is generally sollicitous
for a kind of ballance in a landskip, and, if I am
not mistaken, the painters generally furnish one:
A building for instance on one side, contrasted by
a group of trees, a large oak, or a rising hill on
the other. Whence then does this taste proceed,
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
but from the love we bear to regularity in per∣fection?
After all, in regard to gardens, the
shape of ground, the disposition of trees, and
the figure of water, must be sacred to nature;
and no forms must be allowed that make a dis∣covery
of art.</P>
<P>ALL trees have a character analogous to that
of men: Oaks are in all respects the perfect
image of the manly character: In farmer times
I should have said, and in present times I think
I am authorized to say, the British one. As a
brave man is not suddenly either elated by pros∣perity,
or depressed by adversity, so the oak dis∣plays
not it's verdure on the sun's first approach;
nor drops it, on his first departure. Add to this
it's majestic appearance, the rough grandeur of
of it's bark, and the wide protection of it's
branches.</P>
<P>A LARGE, branching, aged oak, is perhaps
the most venerable of all inanimate objects.</P>
<P>URNS are more solemn, if large and plain;
more beautiful, if less and ornamented. So∣lemnity
is perhaps their point, and the situati∣on
of them should still cooperate with it.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141"/>
BY the way, I wonder that lead statues are
not more in vogue in our modern gardens.
Though they may not express the finer lines of
an human body, yet they seem perfectly well
calculated, on account of their duration, to em∣bellish
landskips, were they some degrees infe∣rior
to what we generally behold. A statue in
a room challenges examination, and is to be ex∣amined
critically as a statue. A statue in a gar∣den
is to be considered as one part of a scene or
landskip; the minuter touches are no more essen∣tial
to it, than a good landskip painter would
esteem them were he to represent a statue in his
picture.</P>
<P>APPARENT art, in it's proper province, is al∣most
as important as apparent nature. They
contrast agreeably; but their provinces ever
should be kept distinct.</P>
<P>WHERE some artificial beauties are so dexte∣rously
managed that one cannot but conceive
them natural, some natural ones so extremely for∣tunate
than one is ready to swear they are arti∣ficial.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="142"/>
CONCERNING scenes, the more uncommon
they appear, the better, provided they form a
picture, and include nothing that pretends to be
of nature's production, and is not. The shape of
of ground, the site of trees, and the fall of water,
nature's province. Whatever thwarts her is
treason.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, buildings and the works
of art, need have no other reference to nature
than that they afford the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with which the
human mind is delighted.</P>
<P>ART should never be allowed to set a foot in
the province of nature, otherwise than clandes∣tinely
and by night. Whenever she is allowed
to appear here, and men begin to compromise the
difference—Night, gothicism, confusion and ab∣solute
chaos are come again.</P>
<P>To see one's urns, obelisks, and waterfalls
laid open; the nakedness of our beloved mis∣tresses,
the naiads, and the dryads, exposed by
that ruffian winter to universal observation; is a
severity scarcely to be supported by the help of
blazing hearths, chearful companions, and a bot∣tle
of the most grateful burgundy.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143"/>
THE works of a person that builds, begin im∣mediately
to decay; while those of him who
plants begin directly to improve. In this, plant∣ing
promises a more lasting pleasure, than build∣ing;
which, were it to remain in equal perfection,
would at best begin to moulder and want repairs
in imagination. Now trees have a circumstance
that suits our taste, and that is annual variety.
It is inconvenient indeed, if they cause our love
of life to take root and flourish with them;
whereas the very sameness of our structures will,
without the help of dilapidation, serve to wean
us from our attachment to them.</P>
<P>IT is a custom in some countries to condemn
the characters of those (after death) that have
neither planted a tree, nor begat a child.</P>
<P>THE taste of the citizen and of the mere
peasant are in all respects the same. The for∣mer
gilds his balls; paints his stonework and
statues white; plants his trees in lines or cir∣cles;
cuts his yew-trees four-square or conic;
or gives them, what he can, of the resemblance
of birds, or bears, or men; squirts up his rivu∣let
in jetteaus; in short, admires no part of na∣ture,
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
but her ductility: exhibits every thing that
is glaring, that implies expence, or that effects a
surprize because it is unnatural. The peasant is
his admirer.</P>
<P>IT is always to be remembered in gardening
that sublimity or magnificence, and beauty or
variety, are very different things. Every scene
we see in nature is either tame and insipid; or
compounded of those. It often happens that
the same ground may receive from art, either
certain degrees of sublimity and magnificence,
or certain degrees of variety and beauty; or a
mixture of each kind. In this case it remains to
be considered in which light they can be ren∣dered
most remarkable, whether as objects, of
beauty, or magnificence. Even the temper of
the proprietor should not perhaps be wholly
disregarded: for certain complexions of soul will
prefer an orange tree or a myrtle, to an oak or
cedar. However this should not induce a gardi∣ner
to parcel out a lawn into knots of shrub∣bery;
or invest a mountain with a garb of roses.
This would be like dressing a giant in a sarsenet
gown, or a saracen's head in a brussels night∣cap.
Indeed the small and circular clumps of
firs, which I see planted upon some fine large
swells, put me often in mind of a coronet placed
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
on an elephant or camel's back. I say a gardi∣ner
should not do this, any more than a poet
should attempt to write of the king of Prussia
in the style of Philips. On the other side, what
would become of Lesbia's sparrow should it be
treated in the same language with the anger of
Achilles?</P>
<P>Gardiners may be divided into three sorts, the
landskip gardiner, the parterre gardiner, and
the kitchen gardiner, agreeably to our first di∣vision
of gardens.</P>
<P>I HAVE used the word landskip-gardiners; be∣cause
in pursuance of our present taste in gar∣dening,
every good painter of landskip appears
to me the most proper designer. The misfortune
of it, is, that these painters are apt to regard
the execution of their work, much more than the
choice of subject,</P>
<P>THE art of distancing and approximating,
comes truly within their sphere: the former by
the gradual diminution of distinctness, and of
size; the latter by the reverse. A strait lined
avenue that is widened in front, and planted there
with ewe trees, then firs, then with trees more
and more fady, till they end in the almond-wil∣low,
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
or silver osier; will produce a very remark∣able
deception of the former kind; which de∣ception
will be encreased, if the nearer dark
trees, are proportionable and truly larger than
those at the end of the avenue that are more
fady.</P>
<P>To distance a building, plant as near as you
can to it, two or three circles of different co∣loured
greens—Ever-greens are best for all such
purposes—Suppose the outer one of holly, and the
next of laurel, &amp;c. The consequence will be that
the imagination immediately allows a space be∣twixt
these circles and another betwixt the house
and them; and as the imagined space is indetermi∣nate,
if your building be dim-coloured, it will not
appear inconsiderable. The imagination is a greater
magnifier than a microscopic glass. And on this
head, I have known some instances, where by shew∣ing
intermediate ground, the distance has ap∣peared
less, than while an hedge or grove con∣cealed
it.</P>
<P>HEDGES, appearing as such, are universally
bad. They discover art in nature's province.</P>
<P>TREES in hedges partake of their artificiali∣ty,
and become a part of them. There is no
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
more sudden, and obvious improvement, than an
hedge removed, and the trees remaining; yet
not in such manner as to mark out the former
hedge.</P>
<P>WATER should ever appear, as an irregular
lake, or winding stream.</P>
<P>Islands give beauty, if the water be adequate;
but lessen grandeur through variety.</P>
<P>IT was the wise remark of some sagacious ob∣server,
that familiarity is for the most part pro∣ductive
of contempt. Graceless offspring of so
amiable a parent! Unfortunate beings that we
are, whose enjoyments must be either checked,
or prove destructive of themselves. Our passions
are permitted to sip a little pleasure; but are
extinguished by indulgence, like a lamp over∣whelmed
with oil. Hence we neglect the beauty
with which we have been intimate; nor would
any addition it could receive, prove an equivalent
for the advantage it derived from the first im∣pression.
Thus negligent of graces that have
the merit of reality, we too often prefer imagi∣nary
ones that have only the charm of novelty:
And hence we may account, in general, for the
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
preference of art to nature, ill our old fashioned
gardens.</P>
<P>ART, indeed, is often requisite to collect and
epitomize the beauties of nature; but should
never be suffered to set her mark upon them:
I mean in regard to those articles that are of na∣ture's
province; the shaping of ground, the
planting bf trees, and the disposition of lakes and
rivulets. Many more particulars will soon oc∣cur,
which, however, she is allowed to regulate,
somewhat clandestinely, upon the following ac∣count—Man
is not capable of comprehending the
universe at one survey. Had he faculties equal
to this, he might well be censured for any mi∣nute
regulations of his own. It were the same,
as if, in his present situation, he strove to find
amusement in contriving the fabrick of an ant's
nest, or the partitions of a bee-hive. But we
are placed in the corner of a sphere; endued
neither with organs, nor allowed a station, pro∣per
to give us an universal view; or to exhibit
to us the variety, the orderly proportions, and
dispositions of the system. We perceive many
breaks and blemishes, several neglected and un∣variegated
places in the part; which, in the
whole would appear either imperceptible, or
beautiful. And we might as rationally expect a
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
snail to be satisfied with the beauty of our par∣terres,
slopes, and terrasses—or an ant to prefer
our buildings to her own orderly range of gra∣naries,
as that man should be satisfied, without a
single thought that he can improve the spot that
falls to his share. But, though art be necessary
for collecting nature's beauties, by what reason
is she authorized to thwart and to oppose her?
Why, fantastically endeavor to humanize those
vegetables, of which nature, discreet nature,
thought it proper to make trees? Why endow
the vegetable bird with wings, which nature has
made momentarily dependent upon the soil?
Here art seems very affectedly to make a display
of that industry, which it is her glory to conceal.
The stone which represents an asterisk, is valued
only on account of it's natural production: Nor
do we view with pleasure the laboured carvings
and futile diligence of Gothic artists. We view
with much more satisfaction some plain Grecian
fabric, where art, indeed, has been equally,
but less visibly, industrious. It is thus we, in∣deed,
admire the shining texture of the silk∣worm;
but we loath the puny author, when she
thinks proper to emerge; and to disgust us with
the appearance of so vile a grub.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150"/>
BUT this is merely true in regard to the par∣ticulars
of nature's province; Wherein art can
only appear as the most abject vassal, and had,
therefore, better not appear at all. The case
is different where she has the direction of build∣ings,
useful or ornamental; or, perhaps, claims
as much honor from temples, as the deities to
whom they are inscribed. Here then it is her
interest to be seen as much as possible: And,
though nature appear doubly beautiful by the
contrast her structures furnish, it is not easy
for her to confer a benefit which nature, on her
side, will not repay.</P>
<P>A RURAL scene to me is never perfect with∣out
the addition of some kind of building: In∣deed
I have known a scar of rock-work, in great
measure, supply the deficiency.</P>
<P>IN gardening it is no small point to enforce
either grandeur or beauty by surprize; for in∣stance,
by abrupt transition from their contraries—but
to lay a stress upon surprize only; for ex∣ample,
on the surprize occasioned by an aha!
without including any nobler purpose; is a sym∣ptom
of bad taste, and a violent fondess for mere
concetto.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151"/>
GRANDEUR and beauty are so very opposite,
that you often diminish the one as you encrease
the other. Variety is most a-kin to the latter,
simplicity to the former.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a large hill, varied by art, with
large patches of different-colored clumps, scars
of rock, chalk quarries, villages, or farm-houses;
you will have, perhaps, a more beautiful scene,
but much less grand than it was before.</P>
<P>IN many instances, it is most eligible to com∣pound
your scene of beauty and grandeur—Sup∣pose
a magnificent swell arising out of a well-va∣riegated
valley; it would be disadvantageous to
encrease it's beauty, by means destructive to it's
magnificence.</P>
<P>THERE may possibly, but there seldom happens,
any occasion to fill up valleys, with trees or other∣wise.
It is for the most part the gardener's business
to remove trees, or ought that fills up the low
ground; and to give, as far as nature allows, an
artificial eminence to the high.</P>
<P>THE hedge-row apple-trees in Herefordshire
afford a most beautiful scenery, at the time they
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
are in blossom: But the prospect would be really
grander, did it consist of simple foliage. For the
same reason, a large oak (or beech) in autumn,
is a grander object than the same in spring. The
sprightly green, is then obfuscated.</P>
<P>SMOOTHNESS and easy transitions are no
small ingredient in the beautiful; abrupt and rect∣angular
breaks have more of the nature of the
sublime. Thus a tapering spire is, perhaps, a
more beautiful object than a tower, which is
grander.</P>
<P>MANY of the different opinions relating to
the preference to be given to seats, villas, &amp;c.
are owing to want of distinction betwixt the
beautiful and the magnificent. Both the former
and the latter please; but there are imaginations
particularly adapted to the one, and to the
other.</P>
<P>MR. ADDISON thought an open uninclosed
champain country, formed the best landskip.
Somewhat here is to be considered. Large unva∣riegated,
simple objects have the best pretensions
to sublimity; a large mountain, whose sides are
unvaried with objects, is grander than one with
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
infinite variety: But then it's beauty is propor∣tionably
less.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I think a plain space near the eye
gives it a kind of liberty it loves: And then
the picture, whether you chuse the grand or
beautiful, should be held up at it's proper di∣stance.
Variety is the principal ingredient in
beauty; and simplicity is essential to grandeur.</P>
<P>OFFENSIVE objects, at a proper distance, ac∣quire
even a degree of beauty: For instance,
stubble, fallow ground—</P>

<P>THOUGH I have no sort of inclination to vin∣dicate

My Lord Hardwick, in his condemnation-speech,
remarks, with great propriety, that the laws of
all nations have adjudged rebellion to be the
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
worst of crimes. And in regard to civil societies,
I believe there is none but madmen will dispute
it. But surely with regard to conscience, erro∣neous
judgments and ill-grounded convictions
may render it some people's duty. Sin does not
consist in any deviation from received opinion;
it does not depend upon the understanding, but
the will. Now, if it appear that a man's opi∣nion
has happened to misplace his duty; and
this opinion has not been owing to any vici∣ous
desire of indulging his appetites—In short,
if his own reason, liable to err, have biassed his
will; rather than his will any way contributed
to biass and deprave his reason, he will, perhaps,
appear guilty before none, beside an earthly
tribunal.</P>
<P>A PERSON'S right to resist, depends upon a
conviction, that the government is ill-managed;
that others have more claim to manage it, or
will administer it better: That he, by his re∣sistance,
can introduce a change to it's advantage,
and this without any consequential evils that will
bear proportion to the said advantage.</P>
<P>WHETHER this were not in appearance the case
of Balmerino, I will not presume to say: How

conceived, or from what delusion sprung. But
as, I think, he was reputed an honest man, in

<P>THE modern world considers it as a part of

I would not suffer my relation to be obliterated
even to the twentieth generation. It serves to
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
connect us closer: wherever I disesteemed, I
would abdicate my first-cousin.</P>
<P>CIRCUMLOCUTORY, philosophical obscenity
appears to me the most nauseous of all stuff:
Shall I say it takes away the spirit from it, and
leaves you nothing but a caput mortuum; or
shall I say rather it is a Sir—e in an envelope
of fine gilt-paper, which only raises expectation.
Could any be allowed to talk obscenely with a

<P>YET why repine? I have seen mansions on

<P>I ACTUALLY dreamt that somebody told me

splendid constellation.</P>
<P>THE ways of ballad-singers, and the cries of
half-penny-pamphlets, appeared so extremely hu∣morous,

it gave me pain to observe them without a com∣panion
to partake. For alas, laughter is by no
means a solitary entertainment.</P>
<P>HAD I a fortune of 8 or 10, 000 l. a year, I
would methinks make myself a neighbourhood.
I would first build a village with a church, and
people it with inhabitants of some branch of
trade that was suitable to the country round. I
would then at proper distances erect a number of
genteel boxes of about a 1000 l. a piece, and a∣muse
myself with giving them all the advantages
they could receive from taste. These would I
people with a select number of well-chosen friends,
assigning to each annually the sum of 200 l. for
life. The salary should be irrevocable, in order
to give them independency. The house, of a
more precarious tenure, that, in cases of ingrati∣tude,
I might introduce another inhabitant.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166"/>
How plausible soever this may appear in spe∣culation,
perhaps a very natural and lively novel
might be founded upon the inconvenient conse∣quences
of it, when put in execution.</P>
<P>I THINK I have observed universally that the
quarrels of friends in the latter part-of life, are
never truly reconciled. “Malè sarta gratia nec∣quicquam
coit, &amp; rescinditur.” A wound in
the friendship of young persons, as in the bark
of young trees, may be so grown over, as to
leave no scar. The case is very different in re∣gard
to old persons, and old timber. The reason
of this may be accountable from the decline of
the social passions, and the prevalence of spleen,
suspicion and rancour, towards the latter part
of life.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing, to me, more irksome than
to hear weak and servile people repeat with ad∣miration
every silly speech that falls from a
mere person of rank and fortune. It is crambe
bis cocta.—The nonsense grows more nauseous
through the medium of their admiration, and
shews the venality of vulgar tempers, which can
consider fortune as the goddess of wit.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167"/>
WHAT pleasure it is to pay one's debts! I
remember to have heard Sir T. Lyttleton make
the same observation. It seems to flow from a
combination of circumstances, each of which is
productive of pleasure. In the first place it re∣moves
that uneasiness, which a true spirit feels
from dependence and obligation. It affords plea∣sure
to the creditor, and therefore gratifies our
social affection. It promotes that future confi∣dence,
which is so very interesting to an honest
mind: It opens a prospect of being readily sup∣plied,
with what we want on future occasions:
It leaves a consciousness of our own virtue: and
it is a measure we know to be right, both in point
of justice and of sound oeconomy. Finally, it is
a main support of simple reputation.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim with me (and I would recom∣mend
it to others also, upon the score of pru∣dence)
whenever I lose a person's friendship,
who generally commences enemy, to engage a
fresh friend in his place. And this may be best
effected by bringing over some of one's enemies;
by which means one is a gainer, having an ene∣my
the less, and the same number of friends.
Such a method of proceeding should I think be
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
as regularly observed, as the distribution of va∣cant
ribbons, upon the death of Knights of the
Garter.</P>
<P>IT has been a maxim with me to admit of an
easy reconciliaton with a person whose offence
proceeded from no depravity of heart: But
where I was convinced it did so, to forego, for
my own sake, all opportunities of revenge: to
forget the persons of my enemies as much as I
was able, and to call to remembrance, in their
place, the more pleasing idea of my friends. I
am convinced that I have derived no small share
of happiness from this principle.</P>
<P>I HAVE been formerly so silly as to hope, that
every servant I had might be made a friend: I
am now convinced that the nature of servitude
generally bears a contrary tendency. Peoples
characters are to be chiefly collected from their
education and place in life: Birth itself does
but little. Kings in general are born with
the same propensities as other men, but yet
it is probable from the licence and flattery
that attends their education, that they will be
more haughty, more luxurious, and moresubjected
to their passions, than any men beside. I question
not but there are many attorneys born with open
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
and honest hearts; but I know not one, that has
had the least practice, who is not selfish, trickish,
and disingenuous. So it is the nature of servi∣tude
to discard all generous motives of obe∣dience;
and to point out no other than those
scoundrel ones of interest and fear. There are
however some exceptions to this rule, which I
know by my own experience.</P>

<P>WHEN a man has run all lengths himself with

this consists in having recourse to the utmost
plainness in his own apparel, and at the same
time richly garnishing his foot-man or horse. Let
the servant appear as fine as ever you please, the
world must alway consider the master as his su∣perior.

to me, that a person may love splendour

beauty. Let him who doubts of this peruse
his Essay on Man with attention. Perhaps this

THERE is an important omission in most of our

<P>BOILEAU has endeavoured to prove in one of

INDEED the Essay on Man abounds with illus∣trations
of this maxim; and 'tis amazing to find
how many plausible reasons may be urged to
support it. It seems evident that our itch of
reasoning, and spirit of curiosity precludes more
happiness than it can possibly advance. What
numbers of diseases are entirely artificial things?
Far from the ability of a brute to contrive. We
disrelish and deny ourselves cheap and natural
greatification, through speculative presciences and
doubts about the future. we cannot discover
the designs of our Creator. We should learn
then of brutes to be easy under our ignorance,

so much in armour that one has nothing left to
defend.</P>
<P>IF one would think with philosophers, one
must converse but little with the vulgar. These
by their very number will force a person into a
fondness for appearance, a love of money, a de∣sire
of power; and other plebeian passions: Ob∣jects
which they admire, because they have no
share in; and have not learning to supply the
place of experience.</P>
<P>LIVY, the most elegant and principal of the
Roman historians, was, perhaps, as superstitious
as the most unlearned Plebeian. We see he
never is destitute of appearances, accurately de∣scribed,
and solemnly asserted, to support parti∣cular
events by the interposition of exploded
deities. The puerile attention to chickens feed∣ing
in a morning—And then a piece of gravity:
“Parva sunt haec, sed parva ista non contem∣nenda,
majores nostri maximam hanc rem fece∣runt.”</P>
<P>IT appears from the Roman historians, that
the Romans had a particular veneration for the
fortunate. their epithet Felix seems ever to
to imply a favorite of the gods. I am mistaken,

or modern Rome has generally acted in an oppo∣site
manner. Numbers amongst them have been
canonized upon the single merit of misfortunes.</P>
<P>How different appears antient and modern
dialogue, on account of the superficial subjects
upon which we now generally converse! Add to
this, the ceremonial of modern times, and the
number of titles with which some kings clog and
encumber conversation.</P>
<P>THE celebrated boldness of an eastern meta∣phor
is, I believe, sometimes allowed it, for the

<P>THERE is a sort of masonry in poetry, where∣in
the pause represents the joints of building;
which ought in every line and course to have
their disposition varied.</P>
<P>THE difference betwixt a witty writer and a
writer of taste is chiefly this. The former is
negligent what ideas he introduces, so he joins
them surprizingly—The latter is principally
careful what images he introduces, and studies
simplicity rather than surprize in his manner of
of introduction.</P>
<P>IT may in some measure account for the dif∣ference
of taste in the reading of books, to con∣sider
the difference of our ears for musick. One
is not pleased without a perfect melody of stile,
be the sense what it will: Another, of no ear
for musick, gives to sense it's full weight without
any deduction on account of harshness.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210"/>
HARMONY of period, and melody of stile have
greater weight than is generally imagined in the
judgment we pass upon writing and writers. As
a proof of this, let us reflect, what texts of scrip∣ture;
what lines in poetry; or what periods we
most remember and quote, either in verse or
prose, and we shall find them to be only musical
ones.</P>
<P>I WONDER the antient mythology never shews
Apollo enamoured of Venus; considering the
remarkable deference that wit has paid to beauty
in all ages. The Orientals act more consonantly,
when they suppose the nightingale enamoured
of the rose; the most harmonious bird of the
fairest and most delightful flower.</P>
<P>HOPE is a flatterer; but the most upright
of all parasites, for she frequents the poor man's
hut, as well as the palace of his superior.</P>
<P>WHAT is termed humour in prose, I con∣ceive,
would be considered as burlesque in poetry:
Of which instances may be given.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, burlesque may be divided into such
as turns chiefly upon the thought, and such as
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
depends more upon the expression: Or we may
add a third kind, consisting in thoughts ridicu∣lously
dressed in language much above, or below
their dignity.</P>
<P>THE Splendid shilling, of Mr. Phillips, and
the Hudibras of Butler are the most obvious in∣stances.
Butler, however, depended much upon
the ludicrous effect of his double rhimes. In
other respects, to declare my own sentiments, he
is rather a witty writer than an humorous one.</P>
<P>SCENES below verse, merely versified, lay claim
to a degree of humour.</P>
<P>SWIFT in poetry deserves a place somewhere
betwixt Butler and Horace. He has the wit of
the former, and the graceful negligence which
we find in the latter's epistles and satyrs. I be∣lieve
few people discover less humour in Don
Quixote than myself. For beside the general
sameness of adventure, whereby it is easy to fore∣see
what he will do on most occasions, it is not
so easy to raise a laugh from the wild atchiev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ments
of a madman. The natural passion in that
case is pity, with some small portion of mirth at
most, Sancho's character is indeed comic, and,
were it removed from the romance, would dis∣cover
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
how little there was of humour in the cha∣racter
of Don Quixote.</P>

<P><PB N="232" REF="238"/>
IT may be prudent to give up the more trivial
parts of character for the amusement of the in∣vidious:
As a man willingly relinquishes his silver

be ridiculed for an untoward peruke, than be at∣tacked

<P>VIRTUE seems to be nothing more than a no∣tion
consonant to the system of things. Were a

GLORY relaxes often, and debilitates the mind;
censure stimulates and contracts—both to
an extreme. Simple fame is, perhaps, the pro∣per
medium.</P>
<P>PERSONS of new families do well to make
magnificent funerals, sumptuous weddings, re∣markable
entertainmens: To exhibit a number
of servants in rich and ostentatious liveries; and
to take every publick occasion of imprinting on
the mob an habitual notion of their superiority.
For so is deference obtained from that quarter.</P>
<Q>“Stupet in titulis &amp; imaginibus.”</Q>
<P>ONE scarce sees how it is possible for a country
girl, or a country fellow to preserve their chastity.
They have neither the philosophical pleasure of
books, nor the luxurious pleasure of a table, nor
the refined amusement of building, planting,
drawing, or designing, to divert their imagination
from an object to which they seem continually to
stimulate it by provocative allusions. Add to
this the health and vigour that are almost pecu∣liar
to them.</P>
<P>I AM afraid there are many ladies who only
exchange the pleasures of incontinence for the
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
pleasure they derive from censure. At least
it is no injustice to conclude so, where a person
is extravagantly censorious.</P>
<P>PERSONS of judgment and understanding may
be divided into two sorts. Those whose judg∣ment
is so extensive as to comprehend a great
deal; existences, systems, universals: But as
there are some eyes so constituted as to take in
distant objects, yet be excelled by others in re∣gard
to objects minute or near, so there are other
understandings better calculated for the exami∣nation
of particular objects.</P>
<P>THE mind is at first an open field without par∣titions
or enclosures. To make it turn to most
account, it is very proper to divide and enclose.
In other words, to sort our observations.</P>
<P>SOME men are called sagacious, merely on
account of their avarice: Whereas a child can
clench it's fist the moment it is born.</P>
<P>IT is a point of prudence when you converse

with his inferior, with whom no doubt he
may have the same connexion that you have
with him: And to be upon your guard accord∣ingly.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="242"/>
How deplorable then is a person's condition,
when his mind can only be supported by flattery,
and his constitution but by cordials! When the
relief of his present complaint undermines it's
own efficacy, yet encreases the occasion for which
it is used. Short is then the duration of our tran∣quillity,
or of our lives!</P>
<P>A MAN is not esteemed ill-natured for any ex∣cess
of social affection; or an indiscreet profu∣sion
of his fortune upon his neighbours, compa∣nions,

his affections is as much impaired by this, as by
selfishness.</P>
<P>IF any one's curse can effect damnation, it is

their excellencies to which they have no preten∣sions;
of course, always inclined to dispute the
superiority.</P>

WIT is the refractory pupil of judgment.</P>
<P>VIRTUE should be considered as a part of
taste (and perhaps it is so more in this age, than

deceit or sinister meanings in discourse, as they

<P>THINK when you are enraged at any one,

<P>REFINED sense to a person that is to converse

persons, fortunes, dignities, &amp;c. &amp;c.) I will pre∣sume
the self-love common to human nature,
would make them all prefer their own condi∣tion.</P>
<Q>“Quid statis? nolint—atqui licet esse beatis.”</Q>

<P>A PERSON, elevated one degree above the
populace, assumes more airs of superiority than
one that is raised ten. The reason is somewhat
obvious. His superiority is more contestable.</P>
<P>THE character of a decent, well-behaved gen∣tleman-like
man seems more easily attainable by
a person of no great parts or passions, than by
one of greater genius and more volatility. 'Tis
there no mismanagement, for the former to be
chiefly ambitious of it. When a man's capacity
does not enable him to entertain or animate the
company, it is the best he can do to render
himself inoffensive, and to keep his teeth clean.
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
But the person who has talents for discourse,
and a passionate desire to enliven conversation,
ought to have many improprieties excused, which
in the other were unpardonable. A lady of good∣nature
would forgive the blunder of a country
esquire, who through zeal to serve her with a
glass of claret, should involve his spurs in her
Brussels apron. On the contrary, the fop (who
may in some sense use the words of Horace

would be entitled to no pardon for such unac∣countable
misconduct.</P>
<P>MAN, in general, may be considered as a me∣canick,
and the formation of happiness as his
business or employment: Virtue, his repository

the instruments, and the materials excel,
the work will be executed in the greater per∣fection.</P>

I HAVE known a sensible man of opinion that
one should not be sollicitous about a wife's under∣derstanding.
A woman's sense was with him a
phrase to express a degree of knowledge, which
was likely to contribute mighty little to a hus∣band's
happiness. I cannot be of his opinion.
I am convinced, that as judgment is the portion
of our sex, so fancy and imagination are more
eminently the lot of theirs. If so, after honesty
of heart, what is there we should so much re∣quire?
A wife's beauty will soon decay, it is
doubtful whether in reality first, or in our own
opinion. Either of these is sufficient to pall the
raptures of enjoyment. We are then to seek
for something that will retain it's novelty; or,
what is equivalent, will change it's shape when
her person palls by it's identity. Fancy and
genius bid fairest for this, which have as many
shapes, as there can happen occasions to exert
them. Good-nature, I always suppose. The
former will be expedient to exhilarate and divert
us; the latter to preserve our minds in a temper
to be diverted.</P>
<P>I have known some attorneys of reputable fa∣milies,
and whose original dispositions seemed to
have been open and humane. Yet can I scarce
<PB N="249" REF="247"/>
recollect one, in whom the gentleman, the chri∣stian,
and even the man, was not swallowed up
in the lawyer: They are not only the greatest
tyrants, but the greatest pedants, of all man∣kind.</P>
<P>RECONCILIATION is the tenderest part either
of friendship or of love; the latter more espe∣cially,
in which the soul is more remarkably
softened. Were a person to make use of art in
procuring the affection of his mistress, it were,
perhaps, his most effectual method to contrive a
slight estrangement, and then, as it were imper∣ceptibly,
bring on a reconciliation. The soul
here discovers a kind of elasticity, and, being
forced back, returns with an additional violence.</P>
<P>VIRTUE may be considered as the only means
of dispensing happiness in proper portions to
every moment of our time.</P>
<P>To judge whether one has sufficient pleasure
to render the continuation of life agreeable, it is
not enough to say, Would you die? Take away
first, the hope of better scenes in this life, the
fears of worse in another, and the bodily pain
of dying.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="248"/>
THE fear of death seems as natural, as the
sensation of lust or of hunger: the first and last,
for the preservation of the individual: The other,
for the continuation of the species.</P>
<P>IT seems obvious that God, who created the
World, intends the happiness and perfection of
the system he created. To effect the happiness
of the whole, self-love, in it's degree, is as re∣quisite
as social; for I am myself a part of that
whole, as well as another. The difficulty of
ascertaining what is virtue, lies in proportioning
the degrees of self-love and social. Proximus
sum egomet mihi—Tunica pallio proprior.—Cha∣rity
begins at home. It is so. It ought to be
so; nor is there any inconvenience arises to the
publick, because it is general. Were this away,
the individual must soon perish, and consequently
the whole body. A man has every moment occa∣sion
to exert his self-love for the sake of self∣preservation;
consequently this ought to be
stronger, in order to keep him upon his guard.
A centinel's attention should be greater than that
of a soldier on a review.</P>
<P>THE social, though alike constant, is not equal∣ly
intense, because the selfish, being universal,
<PB N="251" REF="249"/>
renders the social less esseatial to the well-being
of one's neighbour. In short, the self-love and
the social ought to bear such proportion as we
find they generally do. If the selfish passion of
the rest preponderate, it would be self-destruc∣tive
in a few individuals to be over socially dis∣posed.
If the social one prevails generally, to
be of remarkable selfishness must obstruct the
good of society.</P>
<P>MANY feel a superfluous uneasiness for want
of due attention to the following truth.</P>
<P>WE are oftentimes in suspense betwixt the
choice of different pursuits. We chuse one at
last doubtingly, and with an unconquered han∣kering
after the other. We find the scheme,
which we have chosen, answer our expectation
but indifferently—Most worldly projects will.
We, therefore, repent of our choice, and imme∣diately
fancy happiness in the paths which we
decline; and this heightens our uneasiness. We
might at least escape the aggravation of it. It
is not improbable we had been more unhappy,
but extremely probable we had not been less so,
had we made a different decision. This, how∣ever,
relates to schemes that are neither virtuous,
nor vicious.</P>

<P>A JUSTICE and his clerk is now little more
than a blind man and his dog. The profound
ignorance of the former, together with the ca∣nine
impudence and rapacity of the latter, will
but rarely be found wanting to vindicate the com∣parison.
The principal part of the similitude
will appear obvious to every one, I mean, that
the justice is as much dependent on his clerk, for
superior insight and implicit guidance, as the blind
fellow on his cur that leads him in a string.
Add to this, that the offer of a crust will seduce
the conductors of either to drag their masters into

<P>To remark the different figure made by dif∣ferent
persons, under the same circumstances of
fortune! Two friends of mine upon a journey
had so contrived as to reduce their finances to a
single sixpence each. The one with the genteel
and liberal air of abundance, gave his to a black
shoe-boy, who wished his honor a thousand bless∣ings;
the other having lodged a fortnight with a
nobleman, that was his patron, offered his to the
butler, as an instance of his gratitude, who with
difficulty forbore to curse him to his face.</P>

<P>DEFERENCE is the most complicate, the most

<P>BE cautious not to consider a person as your

<P>DEFERENCE, before the company is the gen∣teelest
kind of flattery. The flattery of epistles
affects one less, as they cannot be shewn without an

kind is gross. In short, applause is of too coarse
a nature to be swallowed in the gross—though
the extract or tincture be ever so agreeable.</P>
<P>WHEN a person, for a splendid servitude,
foregoes an humble independency, it may be
called an advancement, if you please: but it ap∣pears
to me an advancement from the pit to the
gallery. Liberty is a more invigorating cordial
than tokay.</P>
<P>THOUGH punctilios are trifling, they may be
as important as the friendships of some persons
that regard them—Indeed it is almost an univer∣sal
practice to rail at punctilio; and it seems in
some measure a consequence of our attachment
to French fashions. However it is extremely
obvious, that punctilio never caused half the
quarrels, that have risen from the freedom of
behaviour, which is it's opposite extreme. Were
all men rational and civilized, the use of cere∣mony
would be superfluous: But as the case is,
it at least fixes some bounds to the encroach∣ments
of eccentric people, who under the deno∣mination
of freedom might demand the privilege
of breaking your head.</P>

<P>THE state of man is not unlike that of a fish
hooked by an angler. Death, allows us a little
line. We flounce, and sport, and vary our
situation: But when we would extend our schemes

by a superior hand, who drags us from our
element, whensoever he pleases.</P>

<P>SOME persons may with justice boast, that

<P>IT is possible to discover in some faces the

easy to remark the same distortion in some minds?
There is a phrase pretty frequent amongst the
vulgar, and which they apply to absolute fools.—That
they have had a rock too much in their
cradles.—With me, it is a most expressive idiom
to describe a dislocated understanding: An un∣derstanding,
for instance, which, like a watch,
discovers a multitude of such parts, as appear
obviously intended to belong to a system of the
greatest perfection; yet which, by some unlucky
jumble, falls infinitely short of it.</P>
<P>Is it not the wound our pride sustains by being
deceived, that makes us more averse to hypo∣crites,
than to the most audacious and barefaced
villain? Yet it seems as much a piece of justice
to commend a man for talking more honestly
than he acts, as it is to blame a man for acting
more dishonestly than he talks. The sum of the

crimes by his deceit, and the other by his im∣pudence.</P>

WE are apt to look for those virtues in the
characters of noblemen, that are but rarely to
be found any where, except in the preambles to
their patents. Some shining exceptions may be
made to this rule: In general we may consider
their appearance with us in publick, as one does
our wearing apparel. “Which lord do you wear
to-day? Why I did think to wear my lord****,
but as there will be little company in the Mall,
I will e'en content myself to wear the same
noble peer I wore yesterday.”</P>
<P>THE worst inconvenience of a small fortune is
that it will not admit of inadvertency. Inadver∣tency,

<P>How important is the eye to the appearance
of an human face! The chief index of temper,
understanding, health, and love. What prodi∣gious
influence must the same misfortunes have
on some persons beyond others! As the loss of an

philosophy to support herself!</P>
<P>THE person least reserved in his abuse of
another's excess in equipage, is commonly the

it a little too seriously.</P>
<P>AMID the most mercenary ages, it is but a

<P>AN order of beauties, as of knights with a

<P>THERE is somewhat very astonishing in the
record of our most celebrated victories: I mean
the small number of the conquerors killed in pro∣portion
to the conquered. At Agincourt, it is
said, were ten thousand, and fourteen thousand
massacred. Livy's accounts of this sort are so asto∣nishing,
that one is apt to disbelieve the histo∣rian—All
the explanation one can find, is, that
the gross slaughter is made when one side takes
to flight.</P>

<P>IT is impossible for a man of sense to guard
against the mortification that may be given him
by fools, or heteroclite characters; because he
cannot foresee them. A wit-would cannot afford
<PB N="263" REF="261"/>
to discard a frivolous conceit, though it tends to
affront you: An old maid, a country put, or a
college pedant, will ignorantly or wilfully blunder
upon such hints as must discompose you.</P>
<P>A MAN that is sollicitous about his health, or

<P>SECOND thoughts oftentimes are the very worst
of all thoughts. First and third very often
coincide. Indeed second thoughts are too fre∣quently
formed by the love of novelty, of shew∣ing
penetration, of distinguishing ourselves from
the mob, and have consequently less of simpli∣city,
and more of affectation. This, however,
<PB N="264" REF="262"/>
regards principally objects of taste and fancy.
Third thoughts, at least, are here very proper
mediators.</P>
<P>“SET a beggar on horse-back, and he'll ride,”
is a common proverb and a real truth. The

the emptiness of it experimentally. The esta∣blished
gentleman disregards it through habit
and familiarity.</P>

<P>ANTIQUITY of family, and distinctions of gen∣try,

they had ever heretofore: The bend dexter or

are greatly out of date. The heralds are at
length discovered to have no legal authority.
Spain, indeed, continues to preserve the distinc∣tion,
and is poor. France (by our dispute about
a trading nobility) seems inclined to shake it off.
Who now looks with veneration on the anti-di∣luvian
pedigree of a Welchman? Property either
is, or is sure to purchase, dictinction, let the
king at arms, or the old maiden aunt preach as
<PB N="265" REF="263"/>
long as either pleases. It is so; perhaps it ought
to be so. All honors should lie open, all encou∣ragement
be allowed to the members of trade in
a trading nation: And as the nobility finds it
very expedient to partake of their profits, so that
they, in return, should obtain a share in the others
honours. One would, however, wish the acqui∣sition
of learning was as sure a road to dignity, as
that of riches.</P>

<P>IT is often asserted by pretenders to singular
penetration, that the assistance fancy is sup∣posed
to draw from wine, is merely imaginary
and chimerical: That all which the poets have
urged on this head, is absolute rant and enthu∣siasm;
and has no foundation in truth or nature.
I am inclined to think otherwise: Judgment, I
readily allow, derives no benefit from the noblest
Cordial. But persons of a phlegmatick constitution,
have those excellencies often suppressed, of which
their imagination is truly capable, by reason of
a lentor, which wine may naturally remove. It
raises low spirits to a pitch necessary for the ex∣ertion
of fancy. It confutes the “Non est tanti,”
so frequently a maxim with speculative persons.
It quickens that ambition, or that social biass;
which makes a person wish to shine, or to please.

<P>AN editor, or a translator, collects the merits

the wit of Ovid, the propriety of Horace, the

<P>I HAVE sometimes thought Virgil so remarka∣bly,
musical, that were his, lines read to a musician,

<P>I THINK I can observe a peculiar beauty in
the addition of a short syllable, at the end of a
blank verse: I mean, however, in blank dialogue.
In other poetry it is as sure to flatten; which
may be discerned in Prior's translation of Calli∣machus,
viz.—“ the holy victim—Dictaean hearst

<P>THE case is only, prose being an imitation of

<P>BUT in dialogue, the language ought never
to leave nature the least out of sight, and espe∣cially,
where pity is to be produced, it appears,
to receive an advantage from the melancholy flow
this syllable occasions. Let me produce a few
instances from Otway's Tragedy of the Unhappy

the reader substitute a word of equal import,
but of a syllable less, in the place of the in∣stances

<P>I SHOULD imagine, that, in some or most of
these examples, a particular degree of tender∣ness
is owing to the supernumerary syllable; yet
it requires a nice ear for the disposition of it (for
it must not be universal); and, with this, may
give at once an harmonious flow, a natural ease,
an energy, tenderness, and variety to the lan∣guage.</P>
<P>A MAN of dry sound judgment attends to the
truth of a proposition;—A man of ear, and sen∣sibility,

<P>IT seems to me that what are called notes at
the bottom of pages (as well as parentheses in
<PB N="274" REF="272"/>
writing) might be generally avoided, without
injuring the thread of a discourse. It is true it
might require some address to interweave them
gracefully into the text; but how much more
agreeable would be the effect, than to interrupt
the reader by such frequent avocations? How
much more graceful to play a tune upon one sett
of keys, with varied stops, than to seek the same
variety, by an awkward motion from one sett, to
another?</P>
<P>IT bears a little hard upon our candour, that
“to take to pieces” in our language signifies the
same as “to expose;” and “to expose” has a sig∣nification,
which good-nature can as little allow,
as can the laws of etymology.</P>
<P>THE ordinary letters from friend to friend
seem capable of receiving a better turn, than
mere compliment, frivolous intelligence, or pro∣fessions

not excess of negligence discover affectation, as
well as it's opposite extreme? There are many
degrees of intermediate solidity betwixt a West∣phalia

<P><PB N="275" REF="273"/>
I AM astonished to remark the defect of ear,
which some tolerably harmonious poets discover
in their Alexandrines. It seems wonderful that
an error so obvious, and so very disgustful to a

The pause being after the sixth syllable, it is plain
the whole emphasis of pronuntiation is thrown
upon the particle a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. It seems most amazing to

<P>“SIMPLEX munditiis” has been esteemed uni∣versally
to be a phrase at once very expressive,

very capable to be explained without circumlo∣cution.
What objection can we make to that

much as it does dirt and rusticity on the other.</P>
<P>THE French use the word naïve in such a
sense as to be explanable by no English word;
<PB N="276" REF="274"/>
unless we will submit to restrain ourselves in the
application of the word sentimental. It means
the language of passion, or the heart; in oppo∣sition
to the language of reflection, and the
head.</P>
<P>THE most frequent mistake that is made,
seems to be that of the means for the end:
Thus riches for happiness, and thus learning
for sense. The former of these is hourly ob∣servable:
And as to the latter, methinks this
age affords frequent and surprizing instances.</P>
<P>IT is with real concern, that I observe many
persons of true poetical genius, endeavouring to
quench their native fire, that they may exhibit
learning without a single spark of it. Nor is it
uncommon to see an author translate a book, when
with half the pains he could write a better; but
the translation favours more of learning, and
gives room for notes which exhibit more.</P>
<P>LEARNING, like money, may be of so base a
coin, as to be utterly void of use; or, if sterling,
may require good management, to make it serve
the purposes of sense or happiness.</P>
<P>WHEN a nobleman has once conferred any
great favor on his inferior, he ought thenceforth

relation to virtue or vice, will at all times find
himself at a loss for an argument.</P>
<P>PEOPLE of real genius have strong passions;
people of strong passions, have great partiali∣ties;
such as Mr. Pope for Lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c.
Persons of flow parts have languid passions,
and persons of languid passions have little par∣tiality.
They neither love, nor hate, nor look,
nor move, with the energy of a man of sense.
The faults of the former should be ballanced
with their excellencies; and the blamelessness of
the latter should be weighed with their insigni∣ficany.
Happiness and virtue are, perhaps,
<PB N="286" REF="284"/>
generally dispensed with more equality than we
are aware.</P>
<P>EXTREME volatile and sprightly tempers seem
inconsistent with any great enjoyment. There
is too much time wasted in the mere transition
from one object to another. No room for those
deep impressions which are made alone by the
duration of an idea; and are quite requisite to
any strong sensation, either of pleasure, or of
pain. The bee to collect honey, or the spider
to gather poyson, must abide some time upon
the weed or flower. They whose fluids are mere
sal volatile, seem rather chearful than happy
men, The temper above described is oftener
the lot of wits, than of persons of great abi∣lities.</P>
<P>THERE are no persons more sollicitous about
the preservation of rank, than those who have
no rank at all. Observe the humours of a
country christening; and you will find no court
jn Christendom so ceremonious, as the quality of
Brentford.</P>
<P>CRITICKS will sometimes prefer the faulty
state of a composition to the improved one,
<PB N="287" REF="285"/>
through mere perverseness: In like manner some
will extol a person's past conduct, to depreciate
his present. These are some of the numerous
shifts, and machinations, of envy.</P>
<P>TREES afford us the advantage of shade in
summer, as well as fuel in winter; as the same
virtue allays the fervor of intemperate passions
in our youth, and serves to comfort and keep us
warm amid the rigours of old age.</P>
<P>THE term Indecision, in a man's character, im∣plies
an idea very nicely different from that of Ir∣resolution;
yet it has a tendency to produce it;
and, like that, has often it's original in excessive
delicacy and refinement.</P>
<P>PERSONS of proud yet abject spirits will de∣spise
you for those distresses, for which the ge∣nerous
mind will pity, and endeavor to befriend
you. A hint, to whom only you should disclose,
and from whom you should conceal them. Yet,
perhaps, in general, it may be prudent to con∣ceal
them from persons of an opposite party.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="286"/>
THE sacrificing of our anger to our interest is
oftentimes no more, than the exchange of a pain∣ful
passion for a pleasurable.</P>
<P>THERE are not five in five hundred that pity,
but, at the same time also despise; a reason that
you should be cautious to whom and where you
complain. The furthest a prudent man should
proceed, in general, is to laugh at some of his
own foibles; when this may be a means of re∣moving
envy from the more important parts of
his character.</P>
<P>EFFEMINACY of appearance, and an excessive
attention to the minuter parts of dress, is, I be∣lieve,
properly, in the general run, esteemed a
symptom of irresolution. But, yet, instances are
seen to abound in the French nation to the con∣trary.
And in our own, that of Lord Mark Kerr
was an instance equal to a thousand. A snuff-box
hinge, rendered invisible, was an object on which
his happiness appeared to turn; which, how∣ever,
might be clouded by a speck of dirt, or
wounded by a hole in the heel of his stocking.
Yet this man's intrepidity was shewn beyond all
<PB N="289" REF="287"/>
contradiction. What shall we say then of Mr.—,
of manners very delicate, yet possessed of
a poetical vein fraught with the noblest and
sublimest images, and of a mind remarkably
well stored with the more masculine parts of
learning?—Here, perhaps, we must remain in
suspence—For though taste does not imply man∣ners,
so neither does it preclude them: Or what
hinders, that a man should feel that same deli∣cacy
in regard to real honor, which he does in
regard to dress?</P>
<P>IF beneficence be not in a person's will, what
imports it to mankind, that it is ever so much
in his power? And yet we see how much more
regard is generally paid to a worthless man of
forune, than to the most benevolent beggar that
ever uttered an ineffectual blessing. It is all agree∣able
to Mr. Burke's Thesis, that the formidable
idea of power affects more deeply than the most
beautiful image we can conceive of moral
virtue.</P>
<P>A PERSON that is not merely stupid, is natu∣rally
under the influence of the acute passions, or
the slow—The principle of revenge is meant for
the security of the individual; and supposing a
<PB N="290" REF="288"/>
person has not courage to put it immediately into
practice, he commonly strives to make himself
remarkable for the perseverance of his resent∣ment.
Both these have the same motive to im∣press
a dread upon our enemies of injuring us
for the future: And though the world be more
Inclined to favor the rash than the phlegmatick
enemy, it is hard to say which of the two has
given rise to more dismal conseqences—The
reason of this partiality may be deduced from
the same original, as the preference that is given
to down-right impudence, before hypocrisy. To
be cheated into an ill-placed esteem, or to be un∣dermined
by concealed malignity, discovers a
contempt for our understanding, and lessens the
idea we entertain of it ourselves. They hurt
our pride more than open violence, or undis∣guised
impudence.</P>
<P>KING James the First, willing to involve the
regal power in mystery, that like natural objects
it might appear greater through the fog, de∣clared
it presumption for a subject to say, “what
a king might do in the fullness of his power.”—This
was absurd; but it seems presumption in
a man of the world, to say what means a man
of genius may think instrumental to his happi∣ness.
<PB N="291" REF="289"/>
W—used to say, it was presumption
for him, to make conjectures on the occasion. A
person of refinement seems to have his pleasures
distinct from the common run of men; what the
world calls important, is to him wholly frivolous;
and what the world esteems frivolous, seems es∣sentail
to his tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE apparatus of a funeral among the middle
rank of people, and sometimes among the great,
has one effect that is not frivolous. It in some
measure dissipates and draws off the attention from
the main object of concern. Weaker minds find
a sort of relief in being compelled to give direc∣tions
about the manner of interment: And the
grave solemnity of the hearse, plumes, and
escutcheons, though they add to the force of
terror, diminish that of simple grief.</P>
<P>THERE are some people whom you cannot re∣gard,
though they seem desirous to oblige you:
Nay, even though they do you actual services.
This is the case wherever their sentiments are
too widely different from your own. Thus a
person truly avaricious can never make himself
truly agreeable to one enamoured with the arts
<PB N="292" REF="290"/>
and sciences. A person of exquisite sensibility
and tenderness can never be truly pleased with
another of no feelings; who can see the most
intimate of his friends or kindred expire without
any greater pain than if he beheld a pitcher
broken. These, properly speaking, can be said
to feel nothing but the point of a sword; and
one could more easily pardon them, if this apathy
were the effect of philosophy, and not want of
thought. But what I would inculcate, is, with
tempers thus different one should never attempt
any close connexion.</P>
<Q><L>“Lupis &amp; agnis quanta sortito obtigit,</L>

<P>Yet it may be a point of prudence to shew them
civility, and allow a toleration to their various
propensities. To converse much with them would
not only be painful, but tend to injure your own
disposition: And to aim at obtaining their ap∣plause,
would only make your character in∣consistent.</P>
<P>THERE are some people who find a gloomy
kind of pleasure in glouting, which could hardly
be encreased by the satisfaction of having their
wishes granted. This is, seemingly, a bad cha∣racter,
<PB N="293" REF="291"/>
and yet often connected with a sense of
honor, of conscious merit, with warm gratitude,
great sincerity, and many other valuable qua∣lities.</P>
<P>THERE is a degree of understanding in women
with which one not only ought to be contented,
but absolutely pleased.—One would not, in them,

<P>THE worst consequence of gratifying our pas∣sions
in regard to objects, of an indifferent na∣ture,
is, that it causes them to proceed with
greater violence towards other and other objects;
and so ad infinitum. I wish, for my pocket, an
elegant etui; and gold to remove the pain of wish∣ing,
and partake the pleasure of enjoyment. I would
part with the purchase-money, for which I have
less regard; but the gratification of this wish
would generate fifty others, that would be ruinous.
See Epictetus; who, therefore, advises to resist
the first.</P>
<P>VIRTUE and agreeableness are, I fear, too
often separated; that is, externals affect and
captivate the fancy, where internal worth is
<PB N="294" REF="292"/>
wanting, to engage and attach one's reason—A
most perplexing circumstance; and no where
more remarkable, than when we see a wise

<P>I KNOW not whether encreasing years do not

<P>I THINK I never knew an instance of great
quickness of parts being joined with great so∣lidity.
The most rapid rivers are seldom or never

<P>To be at once a rake, and to glory in the cha∣racter,
discovers at the same time a bad disposition

<P>THERE are persons who slide insensibly into an
habit of contradiction. Their first endeavor, upon
<PB N="295" REF="293"/>
hearing aught asserted, is to discover wherein
it may be plausibly disputed. This, they ima∣gine,
gives an air of great sagacity; and if they
can mingle a jest with contradiction, think they
display great superiority. One should be cautious
against the advances of this kind of propensity,
Which loses us friends, in a matter generally of
no consequence.</P>
<P>THE sollicitude of peers to preserve, or to

<P>AN income for life only seems the best cal∣culated
for the circumstances and situation of

<P>SURPRIZE quickens enjoyment, and expectation

to this, that imagination is a great magnifier, and
causes the hopes we conceive to grow too large

WHEN misfortunes happen to such as diffent
from us in matters of religion, we call them

the settled course of things.</P>
<P>IN regard to church-musick, if a man cannot
be said to be merry or good-humored when he

devout or pious when he is tweedled into zeal
by the drone pipe of an organ?—In answer to
this it may be said, that if such an elevation of
the spirits be not meritorious, be not devotion,
yet it is attended with good consequences; as it
leaves a good impression upon the mind favorable
to virtue and a religious life.</P>
<P>THE rich man, adjoining to his country-seat,
erects a chapel, as he pretends, to God Almighty,
but, in truth, to his own vain-glory; furnishes it

his bed-side, and goes to Heaven before him.</P>

I SHOULD think a clergyman might distinguish
himself by composing a sett of sermons upon the
ordinary virtues extolled in classic writers, in∣troducing

Juvenal's Stemmata quid faciunt, Horace's Non

<P>2. A SERMON upon the advantages of compe∣tency,
contentment, and rural life, might be
abundantly embellished from the classicks, and
would be both grateful and serviceable to the
common people: As the chief passion from which
they suffer is envy, I believe, misplaced.</P>
<P>3. ANOTHER might be calculated for each
season of the year: Illustrating the wisdom, the
power, and the benevolence of Providence—How
idle to forego such fair and peaceable subjects,
for the sake of widening the breach betwixt
grace and works, predestination and election;
solving the revelations; or ascertaining the pre∣cise
nature of Urim and Thummim?</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="298"/>
IT is a common argument amongst divines, in
the behalf of a religious life, that a contrary
behaviour has such consequences when we come
to die. It is indeed true, but seems an argument
of a subordinate kind: The article of death is
more frequently of short duration. Is it not a
stronger persuasive, that virtue makes us happy
daily, and removes the fear of death from our
lives antecedently, than that it smooths the pil∣low
of a death-bed?</P>
<P>IT is a question whether the remaining super∣stitions
among the vulgar of the English nation
ought wholly to be removed. The notion of a
ghost's appearance for the discovery of murder,
or any flagrant act of injustice; “that what is
got over the devil's back will be spent under his
belly;” “that cards are the devil's books,” &amp;c</P>
<P>IF there be numbers of people that murder
and devour their species; that have contradictory
notions of beauty; that have deemed it merito∣rious
to offer up human sacrifices; to leave their
parents in deserts of wild beasts; to expose their
offspring as soon as born, &amp;c. &amp;c. there should
seem to be no universal moral sense; and of
consequence, none.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="299"/>
IT is not now, “We have seen his star in the
east,” but “We have seen the star on his
breast, and are come to worship him.”</P>
<P>IT is said, and I believe justly enough, that
crimes appear less heinous to a person that is
about committing them, than to his conscience
afterwards. Is then the crime to be imputed to
him in the degree he foresaw it, or in that he re∣flects
upon it? Perhaps the one and the other
may incline towards an extreme.</P>
<P>THE word Religio amongst the Romans, and
the word Church among the Christians, seem to
have more interpretations than almost any other.
“Malus procidit, eâ religione moti.”—Livy, p.
1150. vol. II. here religion seems to mean pro∣digy—“Si
quis tale sacrum solenne duceret, nec
se sine religione &amp; piaculo id omittere posse.”
Livy 1157. here it seemingly means impiety:
“Piaculum” being such an offence as required
expiatory sacrifices.
<Q>“Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.”</Q>
here it means superstition, as it does often in
Lucretius.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="300"/>
THE pope's wanton excommunications; his ca∣pricious
pardon of his sins; his enormous indul∣gences,
and other particulars of like nature,
shew that (whatever religions may practice cru∣elty)
it is peculiarly the church that makes a jest
of God Almighty.</P>
<P>THE word church has these different senses.</P>
<P>1. A SETT of people ordained to assist at
divine service.</P>
<P>2. THE members of a certain religious profession,
including clergy and laity.</P>
<P>3. A LARGE piece of building dedicated to the
service of God, and furnished with proper con∣veniences
for those who meet to worship him.</P>
<P>4. A BODY of people who too frequently
harrass and infest the laity according to law, and
who conceal their real names under that of a
spiritual court.</P>
<P>How ready have all nations been, after
having allowed a proper portion of laud and
praise to their own abilities, to attribute
their success in war to the peculiar favor of a
just Providence! Perhaps this construction, as it
is often applyed, argues more of presumption
<PB N="303" REF="301"/>
than gratitude. In the first place, such is the
partiality of the human heart, that, perhaps,
two hostile nations may alike rely upon the
justice of their cause; and which of the two has
the better claim to it, none but Providence can itself
discover. In the next, it should be observed,
that success by no means demonstrates justice.
Again, we must not wholly forget to consider,
that success may be no more than a means of
destruction. And lastly, supposing success to be
really and absolutely good, do we find that
individuals are always favored with it in pro∣portion
to their desert; and if not individuals,
why must we then suppose it to be the uniform
recompence of society?</P>
<P>IT is often given as a reason why it is incum∣bent
on God Almighty's justice, to punish or re∣ward
societies, in this world, because, hereafter,
they cannot be punished or rewarded on account
of their dissolution. It is, indeed, true that hu∣man
vengeance must act frequently in the gross;
and whenever a government declares war against
a foreign society, or finds it needful to chastise
any part of it's own, must of necessity involve
some innocent individuals, with the guilty. But
it does not appear so evident, that an omniscient
and omnipotent Being, who knows the secrets of
<PB N="304" REF="302"/>
all hearts, and is able to make a distinction in
his punishments, will judge his unhappy creatures
by these indiscriminate and imperfect laws.</P>
<P>SOCIETIES then are to be considered as the
casual or arbitrary assortments of human insti∣tution.
To suppose that God Almighty will, by
means of punishments, often called judgments,
destroy them promiscuously, is to suppose that
he will regulate his government according to the
cabals of human wisdom. I mean to be under∣stood
here, with regard to what are called judg∣ments,
or, in other words, praeternatural inter∣positions
of Providence. In a natural way, the
constitution of the universe requires, that the
good must often suffer with the bad part of
society. But in regard to judgments upon whole
bodies (which we have days appointed to depre∣cate)
let us introduce a case, which may serve
to illustrate the improbability.</P>
<P>SOCIETIES, I suppose then, are not divine but
human bundles.</P>
<P>IMAGINE a man to mix a large quantity of
sand and gunpowder; then parcel out the com∣position
into different heaps, and apply fire to
them separately, The fire, it is very obvious,
<PB N="305" REF="303"/>
would take no notice of the bundles; would by no
means consume, here and there, a bundle in the
gross, but would affect that part of every por∣tion
that was combustible.</P>
<P>IT may speciously enough be said, what greater
injustice is it to punish a society promiscuously,
than to involve an innocent son in the punish∣ment
due to a sinful father? To this I answer,
the natural system (which we need not doubt,
upon the whole, is right) occasions both the good
and bad to suffer many times indiscriminately.
But they go much further—They say God, as
it were, interferes in opposition to the settled
course of things to punish, and include societies
in one promiscuous vengeance. Were he to in∣flict
extraordinary punishments distinct from those
which sin entails upon us, he surely would not
regulate them by mere human assortments, but
would make the juster distinction of good and
evil individuals.</P>
<P>NEITHER do I see why it is so necessary, that
societies, either here or hereafter, should be
punished as societies. “The soul that sinneth,
it shall die.”</P>

How happy may a lord bishop render a pea∣sant

It is the same with regard to religious

they assent implicitly to the opinions of men who,
they think, should know. A person of distin∣guished
parts and learning has no such advan∣tages.

<P>IN travelling one contrives to allow day-light

hard is it, that every unhappiness seems united

necessary to our support; of which
nothing can supply the place beside religion and
<PB N="307" REF="305"/>
philosophy. But then the foundation must be
laid in meditation and enquiry; at an unmolested
season, when our faculties are strong and vigo∣rous;

<P>CONSCIENCE is adscititious; I mean influenced

<P>ATTRACTIONS of either kind are less per∣spicuous,

Were two persons to meet in Ispahan, though
quite strangers to each other here, would they
not go near to feel a kind of friendship, on the
single score of their being Englishmen? Would

they not pass a chearful evening together over
rice and sherbett?—In like manner, suppose two
or three cotemporaries only, to meet on the sur∣face
of the globe amid myriads of persons of all
other ages whatsoever, would they not discover a
mutual tenderness, even though they had been
enemies when living. What then remains, but
that we revive the memory of such relations
now, in order to quicken our benevolence? That
we are all country-men is a consideration that is more
commonly inculcated, and limits our benevolence to
a smaller number also. That we are cotempora∣ries,
and persons whom future history shall unite,
who, great part of us, however imperceptibly,
receive and confer reciprocal benefits; this, with
every other circumstance that tends to heigthen
our philanthropy, should be brought to mind as

<P>WHAT one understands by a general Provi∣dence
is that attention of the Almighty to the
works of his Creation, by which they pursue
their original course, without deviating into such
eccentrick motions as must immediately tend to
the destruction of it. Thus a philosopher is
<PB N="310" REF="308"/>
enabled to foretell eclipses with precision; and a
stone thrown upward, drops uniformly to the
ground. Thus an injury awakes resentment; and
a good office endears to us our benefactor.
And it seems no unworthy idea of omnipotence,
perhaps, to suppose he at first constituted a system,
that stood in no need either of his counter-acting
or suspending the first laws of motion.</P>
<P>BUT after all, the mind remains; and we can
shew it to be either impossible, or improbable,
that God directs the will? Now whether the di∣vine
Being occasions a ruin to fall miraculously,

<HEAD>ON TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>I BELIEVE that, generally speaking, persons

principles of the rest; and to try this, I have
often sollicited a stranger to hum a tune, and
have seldom failed of success. This, however,
does not extend to talents beyond the sphere of
taste; and Handel was evidently wrong, when
he fancied himself born to command a troop of
horse.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in general, may be divided into
persons of understanding, and persons of genius;
each of which will admit of many subordinate
degrees. By persons of understanding, I mean
persons of found judgment; formed for mathe∣matical
deductions, and clear argumentation. By
persons of genius, I would characterize those in
whom true and genuine fancy predominates;
and this whether assisted, or not, by culti∣vation.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="310"/>
I HAVE thought that genius and judgment
may, in some respects, be represented by a
liquid and a solid. The former is, generally
speaking, remarkable for it's sensibility, but
then loses it's impression soon: The latter is less
susceptible of impression, but retains it longer.</P>
<P>DIVIDING the world into an hundred parts,
I am apt to believe the calculation might be thus
adjusted.</P>

<P>THERE is hardly any thing so uncommon, as a
true native taste improved by education.</P>
<P>THE object of taste is corporeal beauty;
for though there is manifestly a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; a
pulchrum, an honestum, and decorum, in moral
actions; and although a man of taste that is not
virtuous, commits a greater violence upon his
<PB N="313" REF="311"/>
sentiments than any other person; yet, in the
ordinary course of speaking, a person is not
termed a man of taste, merely because he is a
man of virtue.</P>
<P>ALL beauty may be divided into absolute, and
relative, and what is compounded of both.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon to hear a modern Quixote
insist upon the superiority of his idol or Dulcinea;
and, not content to pay his own tribute of ado∣ration,
demand, that of others in favor of her ac∣complishments.
Those of grave and sober sense
cannot avoid wondering at a difference of opi∣nions,
which are in truth supported by no cri∣terion.</P>
<P>EVERY one, therefore, ought to fix some mea∣sure
of beauty, before he grows eloquent upon
the subject.</P>
<P>EVERY thing seems to derive it's pretensions
to beauty, on account of its color, smoothness,
variety, uniformity, partial resemblance to some∣thing
else, proportion, or suitableness to the
end proposed, some connexion of ideas, or a
mixture of all these.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="312"/>
As to the beauty of colors, their present
effect seems in proportion to their impulse; and
scarlet, were it not for habit, would affect an
Indian before all other colors.</P>
<P>RESEMBLANCES wrought by art; pictures,
bustos, statues, please.</P>
<P>COLUMNS, proportioned to their incumbent
weight; but herein we suppose omogeneous ma∣terials;
it is otherwise, in case we know that a
column is made of iron.</P>
<P>HABIT, herein, seems to have an influence
to which we can affix no bounds. Suppose the
generality of mankind formed with a mouth from
ear to ear, and that it were requisite in point of
respiration, would not the present make of mouths,
have subjected a man to the name of Bocha
chica?</P>
<P>IT is probable, that a clown would require
more color in his Chloe's face, than a courtier.</P>
<P>WE may see daily the strange effects of habit
in respect of fashion. To what colors, or pro∣portions,
does it not reconcile us!</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="313"/>
CONCEIT is false taste; and very widely dif∣ferent
from no taste at all.</P>
<P>BEAUTY of person should, perhaps, be esti∣mated
according to the proportion it bears to
such a make and features, as are most likely to
produce the love of the opposite sex. The look
of dignity, the look of wisdom, the look of de∣licacy
and refinement seem, in some measure,
foreign. Perhaps the appearance of sensibility
may be one ingredient; and that of health,
another. At least, a cadaverous countenance is
the most disgusting in the world.</P>
<P>I KNOW not, if one reason of the different
opinions concerning beauty, be not owing to
self-love.'People are apt to form some criterion,
from their own persons, or possessions. A tall
person approves the look of a folio or octavo: A
square thick-set man is more delighted with a
quarto. This instance, at least, may serve to
explain what I intend.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it sometimes happens that a person
may have what the artists call an ear and an
eye, without taste: For instance, a man may some∣times
have a quickness in distinguishing the simi∣litude
<PB N="316" REF="314"/>
or difference of lines and sounds, without
any skill to give the proper preference betwixt
the combinations of them.</P>
<P>TASTE produces different effects upon different
complexions. It consists, as I have often observed,
in the appetite and the discernment; then most
properly so called, when they are united in equal
proportions.</P>
<P>WHERE the discernment is predominant, a
person is pleased with fewer objects, and re∣quires
perfection in what he sees. Where the
appetite prevails, he is so much attached to
beauty, that he feels a gratification in every
degree, in which it is manifested. I frankly own
myself to be of this latter class: I love painting
and statuary so well, as to be not undelighted
with moderate performances.</P>
<P>THE reason people vary, in their opinions of
a portrait, I mean, with regard to the resemblance
it bears to the original; seems no other, than that
they lay stress on different features in the ori∣ginal;
and this different stress is owing to dif∣ferent
complexions of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="315"/>
PEOPLE of little or no taste commend a person
for it's corpulency. I cannot see, why an ex∣crescence
of belly, cheek, or chin, should be
deemed more beautiful than a wen on any other
part of the body. Through a connexion of ideas,
it may form the beauty of a pig or an ox.</P>
<P>THERE feems a pretty exact analogy between
the objects and the senses. Some tunes, some
tastes, some visible objects, please at first, and
that only; others, only by degrees, and then long.—(Raspberry-jelly-Green-tea-Alley-Croaker—Air
in Ariadne—A Baron's Robe—and a Bi∣shops
Lawn). Perhaps some of these instances
may be ill enough chosen; but the thing is
true.</P>
<P>TUNES, with words, please me the more in
proportion as they approach nearer to the natu∣ral
accent of the words to which they are as∣signed.
Scotch tunes often end high: Their
language does the same.</P>
<P>To how very great a degree, the appearance
of health alone is beauty, I am not able to de∣termine.
I presume the most regular and well∣proportioned
form of limbs and features is at
<PB N="318" REF="316"/>
the same time the most: healthful one: The fittest
to perform the functions and operations of the
body. If so, a perfectly healthful form, is a
perfectly beautiful form—Health is beauty, and
the most perfect health is the most perfect beau∣ty.
To have recourse to experience. The most
sickly and cadaverous countenance is the least
provocative to love; or rather the most incon∣sistent
with it. A florid look, to appear beau∣tiful,
must be the bloom of health, and not the
glow of a fever.</P>
<P>AN obvious connexion may be traced betwixt
moral and physical beauty; the love of symmetry,
and the love of virtue; an elegant taste, and
perfect honesty. We may, we must, rise from
the love of natural to that of moral beauty:
Such is the conclusion of Plato, and of my Lord
Shaftsbury.</P>
<P>WHEREVER there is a want of taste, we ge∣nerally
observe a love of money, and cunning:
And whenever taste prevails, a want of prudence,
and an utter disregard to money.</P>
<P>TASTE (or a just relish of beauty) seems to
distinguish us from the brute creation, as much
as intellect, or reason. We do not find that
<PB N="319" REF="317"/>
brutes have any sensation of this sort. A bull
is goaded by the love of sex in general, with∣out
the least appearance of any distinction in
favor of the more beautiful individual. Accord∣ingly
men, devoid of taste, are in a great mea∣sure
indifferent as to make, complexion, feature;
and find a difference of sex sufficient to excite
their passion in all its fervor. It is not thus where
there is a taste for beauty, either accurate or
erroneous. The person of a good taste, re∣quires
real beauty in the object of his passion;
and the person of bad taste, requires something
which he substitutes in the place of beauty.</P>
<P>PERSONS of taste, it has been asserted, are
also the best qualified to distinguish, and the
most prone to admire moral virtue: Nor does it
invalidate this maxim, that their practice does
not correspond. The power of acting virtuously
depends in a great measure upon withstanding
a present, and perhaps sensual, gratification,
for the sake of a more distant, and intellectual
satisfaction. Now, as persons of fine taste are
men of the strongest sensual appetites, it happens
that in ballancing present and future, they are
apt enough to allow an unreasonable advantage
to the former. On the other hand, a more phleg∣matick
<PB N="320" REF="318"/>
character may, with no greater self-denial,
allow the future, fairer play. But let us wave
the merely sensual indulgences; and let us con∣sider
the man of taste in regard to points of
meum and tuum; in regard to the virtues of for∣giveness;
in regard to charity, compassion, mu∣nificence,
and magnanimity; and we cannot fail
to vote his taste the glorious triumph which it
deserves.</P>
<P>THERE is a kind of counter-taste, founded
on surprize and curiosity, which maintains
a sort of rivalship with the true; and may
be expressed by the name Concetto. Such is
the fondness of some persons for a knife-hast
made from the royal-oak, or a tobacco∣stopper
from a mulberry-tree of Shakespear's
own planting. It gratifies an empty curiosity.
Such is the casual resemblance of Apollo, and
the nine Muses in a piece of agate; a dog ex∣pressed
in feathers, or a wood-cock in mohair.
They serve to give surprize. But a just fancy
will no more esteem a picture, because it proves
to be produced by shells, than a writer would
prefer a pen, because a person made it with
his toes. In all such cases, difficulty should not
be allowed to give a casting weight; nor a needle
<PB N="321" REF="319"/>
be considered as a painter's instrument, when he
is so much better furnished with a pencil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cornelius Ketelborn at Gonda in 1548; landed in England 1573; settled at Amsterdam 1581: took it into his head to grow famous by painting with his fingers instead of pencils.—The whim took—His success encreased—His fingers ap∣pearing too easy tools, he then undertook to paint with his feet.—See H. Walpole's Book of Painters.</NOTE></P>
<P>PERHAPS no print, or even painting, is capa∣ble
of producing a figure answerable to the idea
which poetry or history has given us of great
men: A Cicero, for instance, an Homer, a Cato,
or an Alexander. The same, perhaps, is true
of the grandeur of some antient buildings—And
the reason is, that the effects of a pencil are
distinct and limited, whereas the descriptions of
the pen leave the imagination room to expatiate;
and Burke has made it extremely obvious, that
indistinctness of out-line is one source of the
sublime.</P>
<P>WHAT an absurdity is it, in the framing even
prints to suffer a margin of white paper to ap∣pear
beyond the ground; destroying half the
relievo, the lights are intended to produce?
Frames ought to contraste with paintings; or to
appear as distinct as possible: For which reason,
<PB N="322" REF="320"/>
frames of wood inlaid, or otherwise variegated
with colors, are less suitable than gilt ones,
which exhibiting an appearance of metal afford
the best contraste with color.</P>
<P>THE peculiar expression in some portraits is
owing to the greater or less manifestation of the
soul in some of the features.</P>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, a sublime, and a beauti∣ful,
in the very make of a face, exclusive of any
particular expression of the soul; or, at least,
not expressive of any other than a tame dis∣passionate
one. We see often what the world
calls regular features, and a good complexion,
almost totally unanimated by any discovery of the
temper, or understanding. Whenever the re∣gularity
of feature, beauty of complexion, the
strong expression of sagacity and generosity,
concur in one face, the features are irresis∣tible.</P>
<P>BUT even here it is to be observed, that a sort
of sympathy has a prodigious biass—Thus a
pensive beauty, with regular features and com∣plexion,
will have the preference with a spec∣tator
of the pensive cast; and so of the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="321"/>
THE soul appears to me to discover herself
most in the mouth and eyes with this difference,
that the mouth seems the more expressive of
the temper, and the eye of the understanding.</P>
<P>Is a portrait, supposing it as like as can be to
the person for whom it is drawn, a more or less
beautiful object than the original face? I should
think, a perfect face must be much more pleasing
than any representation of it; and a sett of ugly
features, much more ugly, than the most exact
resemblance that can be drawn, of them. Paint∣ing
can do much by means of shades; but not
equal the force of real relievo; on which ac∣count
it may be the advantage of bad features to
have their effect diminished; but surely, never
can be the interest of good ones.</P>
<P>SOFTNESS of manner seems to be in painting,
what smoothness of syllables is in language; af∣fecting
the sense of sight or hearing, previous
to any correspondent passion.</P>
<P>THE “theory of agreeable sensations” founds
them upon the greatest activity or exercise an
object occasions to the senses, without proceeding
to fatigue. Violent contrails are upon the foot∣ing
<PB N="324" REF="322"/>
of roughness or inequality.—Harmony or
similitude, on the other hand, are somewhat co∣genial
to smoothness.—In other words, these two
recommend themselves; the one to our love of
action; the other to our love of rest. A medi∣um
therefore, may be most agreeable to the
generality.</P>
<P>AN harmony in colors seems as requisite, as a
variety of lines seems necessary, to the pleasure
we expect from outward forms. The lines, in∣deed,
should be well-varied; but yet the opposite
sides of any thing should shew a ballance, or an
appearance pf equal quantity, if we would strive
to please a well-constituted taste.</P>
<P>IT is evident enough to me, that persons often
occur who may be said to have an ear to musick,
and an eye for proportions in visible objects,
who nevertheless can hardly be said to have a
relish or taste for either. I mean that a person
may distinguish notes and tones to a nicety, and
yet not give a discerning choice to what is pre∣ferable
in musick. The same, in objects of
sight.</P>
<P>ON the other hand they cannot have a proper
feeling of beauty or harmony; without a power
<PB N="325" REF="323"/>
of discriminating those notes and proportions,
on which harmony and beauty so fully depend.</P>
<P>WHAT is said, in a treatise lately published,
for beauties being more common than deformity
(and seemingly with excellent reason) may be
also said for virtue's being more common than
vice.</P>
<P>QUERE, Whether beauty do not as much re∣quire
an opposition of lines, as it does an har∣mony
of colors.</P>
<P>THE passion for antiquity, as such, seems in
some measure opposite to the taste for beauty or
perfection. It is rather the foible of a lazy and
pusillanimous disposition, looking back and resting
with pleasure on the steps, by which we have ar∣rived
thus far, than the bold and enterprising
spirit of a genius, whose ambition fires him only
to reach the goal. Such as is described (on ano∣ther
occasion) in the zealous and active cha∣rioteer
of Horace.</P>
<Q><L>“—hunc atque, hunc superare laboret</L>
<L>Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus; illum</L>
<L>Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="326" REF="324"/>
AGAIN, the
<Q>“Nil actum reputans, si quid restaret agendum”</Q>
is the least applicable, of any character, to a
mere antiquarian; who, instead of endeavoring
to improve or to excel, contents himself, perhaps,
with discovering the very name of a first inven∣tor;
or with tracing back an art that is flourish∣ing,
to the very first source of it's original de∣formity.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard it claimed by adepts in musick,
that the pleasure it imparts to a natural ear,
which owes little or nothing to cultivation, is by
no means to be compared, to what they feel
themselves from the most perfect composition—The
state of the question may be best explained
by a recourse to objects that are analogous—Is
a country-fellow less struck with beauty than a
philosopher or an anatomist who knows how that
beauty is produced? Surely no. On the other
hand, an attention to the cause may somewhat
interfere with the attention to the effect—They
may, indeed, feel a pleasure of another sort—The
faculty of reason may obtain some kind of bal∣lance,
for what the more sensible faculty of the
imagination loses.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="325"/>
I AM much inclined to suppose our ideas of
beauty depend greatly upon habit.—What I
mean is, upon the familiarity with objects which
we happen to have seen since we came into the
world.—Our taste for uniformity, from what we
have observed in the individual parts of nature,
a man, a tree, a beast, a bird, or insect, &amp;c. our
taste for regularity from what is within our
power to observe in the several perfections of
the whole system.</P>
<P>A LAND SKIP, for instance, is always irregular;
and to use regularity in painting, or gardening,
would make our work unnatural and disagreeable.
Thus we allow beauty to the different, and al∣most
opposite proportions of all animals.</P>
<P>THERE is, I think, a beauty in some forms, in∣dependent
of any use to which they can be ap∣plied.
I know not whether this may not be re∣solved
into smoothness of surface; with variety
to a certain degree, that is comprehensible with∣out
much difficulty.</P>
<P>As to the dignity of colors, Quere, Whether
those that affect the eye most forcibly, for in∣stance,
scarlet, may not claim the first place; al∣lowing
<PB N="328" REF="326"/>
their beauty to cloy soonest; and other
colors, the next, according to their impulse; al∣lowing
them to produce a more durable pleasure.</P>
<P>IT may be convenient to divide beauty into
the absolute, and the relative. Absolute is that
above-mentioned. Relative is that by which an
object, or part of an object, pleases, through the
relation it bears to some other.</P>
<P>OUR taste of beauty is, perhaps, compounded
of all the ideas that have entered the imagina∣tion
from our birth. This seems to occasion the
different opinion that prevails concerning it.
For instance, a foreign eye esteems those features
and dresses handsome, which we think deformed.</P>
<P>Is it not then likely that those who have seen
most objects, throughout the universe, “caeteris
partibus,” will be the most impartial judges:
Because they will judge truest of the general
proportion which was intended by the Creator;
and is best.</P>
<P>THE beauty of most objects is partly of the
absolute, and partly of the relative kind. A
Corinthian pillar has some beauty dependent on
<PB N="329" REF="327"/>
it's variety and smoothness; which I would call
absolute; it has also a relative beauty, dependent
on it's taperness and foliage; which authors say
was first copied from the leaves of plants, and
the shape of a tree.</P>
<P>UNIFORMITY should, perhaps, be added as
another source of absolute beauty (when it ap∣pears
in one single object) I do not know any other
reason, but that it renders the whole more easily
comprehended. It seems that nature herself con∣siders
it as beauty, as the external parts of the
human frame are made uniform to please the
sight; which is rarely the case of the internal,
that are not seen.</P>
<P>HUTCHINSON determines absolute beauty to
depend on this, and on variety; and says it is
in a compound ratio of both. Thus an octagon
excels a square; and a square, a figure of un∣equal
sides: But carry variety to an extreme, and
it loses it's effect. For instance, multiply the
number of angles till the mind loses the unifor∣mity
of parts, and the figure is less pleasing: Or,
as it approaches nearer to a round, it may be
said to be robbed of it's variety.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="328"/>
BUT amidst all these eulogiums of variety it
is proper to observe that novelty sometimes re∣quires
a little abatement. I mean, that some de∣gree
of familiarity introduces a discovery of rela∣tive
beauty, more than adequate to the bloom
of novelty.—This is, now and then, obvious in
the features of a face, the air of some tunes,
and the flavor of some dishes. In short, it re∣quires
some familiarity to become acquainted
with the relation that parts bear unto the whole;
or one object to another.</P>
<P>VARIETY, in the same object, where the beau∣ty
does not depend on imitation (which is the
case in foliage, bustos, basso-relievos, painting)
requires uniformity. For instance, an octagon is
much more beautiful than a figure of unequal
sides; which is at once various and disagreeable.</P>

THE LEASOWES,

<HEAD>A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE LEASOWES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following description was intended to give a friend some idea of the Leasowes—which having been so justly ad∣mired by persons of the best taste, and celebrated by the Muse of such an original genius as Mr. Shenstone; it is hoped the public will not be displeased with this slight attempt to perpe∣tuate those beauties which time, or the different taste of some future possessor, may destroy.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THE Leasowes is situate in the parish of
Hales Owen, a small market town, in
the county of Salop; but surrounded
by other counties, and thirty miles from
Shrewsbury, as it is near ten to the borders
of Shropshire. Though a paternal estate, it
was never distinguished for any peculiar beauties
till the time of it's late owner. It was reserved
<PB N="334" REF="332"/>
for a person of his ingenuity both to discover
and improve them; which he has done so effec∣tually,
that it is now considered as amongst
the principal of those delightful scenes, which
persons of taste, in the present age, are desirous
to see. Far from violating it's natural beauties,
Mr. Shenstone's only study was to give them
their full effect. And although the form in
which things now appear, be indeed the conse∣quence
of much thought and labor, yet the hand
of art is no way visible either in the shape of
ground, the disposition of trees, or (which are
here so numerous and striking) the romantic fall
of his cascades.</P>
<P>BUT I will now proceed to a more particular
description. About half a mile short of Hales
Owen, in your way from Birmingham to Bewd∣ley,
you quit the great road (at N° I.) and turn
into a green lane on the left hand, where, de∣scending
in a winding manner to the bottom of a
deep valley finely shaded, the first object that
occurs is a kind of ruinated wall, and a small gate,
within an arch, inscribed The Priory Gate (N°2).
Here, it seems, the company should properly begin
their walk; but generally chuse to go up with
their horses or equipage to the house (N° 2); from
whence returning they, descend back into the
<PB N="335" REF="333"/>
valley. Passing through a small gate (N° 3) at the
bottom of the fine swelling lawn that surrounds
the house, you enter upon a winding path, with
a piece of water on your right. The path and
water, over-shadowed with trees that grow
upon the slopes of this narrow dingle, render the
scene at once cool, gloomy, solemn, and seques∣tered;
and forms so striking a contraste to the
lively scene you have just left, that you seem
all on a sudden landed in a subterraneous kind of
region. Winding forward down the valley, you
pass beside a small (N° 4) root-house, where on a
rablet are these lines.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here in cool grot, and mossy cell,</L>
<L>We rural says and faeries dwell;</L>
<L>Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye,</L>
<L>When the pale moon, ascending high,</L>
<L>Darts thro' yon limes her quivering beams,</L>
<L>We frisk it near these crystal streams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her beams reflected from the ware.</L>
<L>Afford the light our revels crave;</L>
<L>The turf, with dailies broider'd o'er,</L>
<L>Exceeds, we wot, the Parian floor;</L>
<L>Nor yet for artful strains we call,</L>
<L>But listen to the water's fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="336" REF="334"/>
<L>Would you then taste our tranquil scene.</L>
<L>Be sure your bosoms be serene;</L>
<L>Devoid of hate, devoid of strife,</L>
<L>Devoid of all that poisons life:</L>
<L>And much it 'vails you in their place,</L>
<L>To graft the love of human race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tread with awe these favour'd bowers,</L>
<L>Nor wound the shrubs, nor bruise the flowers;</L>
<L>So may your path with sweets abound!</L>
<L>So may your couch with rest be crown'd!</L>
<L>But harm betide the wayward swain,</L>
<L>Who dares our hallow'd haunts profane!</L>
</LG>
<P>THESE sentiments correspond as well as possible
with the ideas we form of the abode of fairies;
and appearing deep in this romantic vally, serve
to keep alive such enthusiastic images while this
sort of scene continues.</P>
<P>You now pass through The Priory (N° 5) Gate
before-mentioned, and are admitted into a part
of the valley somewhat different from the former;
tall trees, high irregular ground, and rugged
scars. The right presents you with, perhaps,
the most natural, if not the most striking of the
many cascades here found: The left, with a
<PB N="337" REF="335"/>
sloping grove of oaks; and the center, with a
pretty circular landskip appearing through the
trees, of which Hales Owen sleeple, and other
objects at a distance, form an interesting part.
The (N° 6) seat beneath the ruinated wall has
these lines of Virgil inscribed, suiting well with
the general tenor of Mr. Shenstone's late situ∣ation.</P>
<Q><L>—Lucis habitamus opacis</L>
<L>Riparumque toros, et prata recentia rivis</L>
<L>Incolimus.</L></Q>
<P>You now proceed a few paces down the valley
to another bench, where you have this cascade
in front, which, together with the internal arch
and other appendages, make a pretty irregular
picture. I must observe once for all, that a num∣ber
of these extempore benches (two stumps
with a transverse board) seem chiefly intended
as hints to spectators, lest in passing cursorily
thro' the farm they might suffer any of that im∣mense
variety the place furnishes, to escape their
notice. The stream attending us, with it's agreeable
murmurs, as we descend along this pleasing valley,
we come next to a (N° 7) small seat, where we
have a sloping grove upon the right, and on the left;
a striking vista to the steeple of Hales Owen,
which is here seen in a new light. We now de∣scend
<PB N="338" REF="336"/>
farther down this shady and sequestered val∣ly
accompanied on the right by the same brawl∣ing
rivulet running over pebbles, till it empties
it's self into a fine piece of (N° 8) water at
the bottom. The path here winding to the
left, conforms to the water before-mentioned;
running round the foot of a small hill, and ac∣companying
this semi-circular lake into another
winding valley, somewhat more open, and not less
pleasing than the former. However, before we
enter this, it will be proper to mention a seat
about the center of this water scene, where the
ends of it are lost in the two vallies on each side;
and in front it is invisibly connected with another
piece of water, of about twenty acres, open to'
Mr. Shenstone, but not his property. This last
was a performance of the monks, and part of a
prodigious chain of fish-ponds that belonged to
Hales Abbey. The back ground of this scene
is very beautiful, and exhibits a picture of vil∣lages
and varied ground, finely held up to the
eye.</P>
<P>I SPEAK of all this as already finished; but,
through some misfortune in the mound that;
pounds up the water, it is not compleated.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="337"/>
WE now leave the (N° 9) Priory upon the left,
which is not meant for an object here, and wind
along into the other valley. And here I cannot
but take notice of the judgment which formed
this piece of water; for although it be not very
large, yet, as it is formed by the concurrence of
three vallies, in which two of the ends are hid,
and in the third it seems to join with the large
extent of water below, it is, to all appearance
unbounded. I must confess I never saw a more
natural bed for water, or any kind of lake that
pleased me better. But it may be right to
mention, that this water, in it's full extent, has
a yet more important effeft from Mr. Shenstone's
house, where it is seen to a great advantage. We
now, by a pleasing serpentine walk, enter a nar∣row
glade in the valley, the slopes on each side finely
covered with oaks and beeches, on the left of
which is a (N° 10) common bench, which affords a
retiring place secluded from every eye, and a
short respite, during which the eye reposes on a
fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to a (N° 11) seat beneath a
prodigiously fine canopy of spreading oak, on the
buck of which is this inscription,
<Q><PB N="340" REF="338"/>
<L>Huc ades, O Meliboee! caper tibi salvus et
hoedi;</L>
<L>Et si quid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra.</L></Q>
The picture before it is that of a beautiful home
scene; a small lawn of well-varied ground en∣compassed
with hills and well-grown oaks, and
embellished with a cast of the piping Faunus,
amid trees and shrubs on a slope upon the left;
and on the right, and nearer the eye, with an
urn thus inscribed,
<Q><L>INGENIO ET AMICITIAe</L>
<L>GULIELMI SOMERVILLE.</L></Q>
And on the opposite side,
<Q><L>G S POSVIT,</L>
<L>Debitâ spargens lacrimâ favillam</L>
<L>Vatis amici.</L></Q>
The scene is enclosed on all sides by trees, in the
middle only there is an opening, where the lawn is
continued and winds out of sight.</P>
<P>HERE entering a (N° 11) gate, you are led, thro'
a thicket of many sorts of willows, into a large
root-house, inscribed to the Right Honorable
the Earl of Stamford. It seems, that worthy
<PB N="341" REF="339"/>
peer was present at the first opening of the
cascade (N° 12), which is the principal object
from the root-house, where the eye is presented
with a fairy vision, consisting of an irregular
and romantic fall of water, very unusual, one
hundred and fifty yards in continuity, and a
very striking scene it affords. Other cascades
may possibly have the advantage of a greater
descent, and a larger torrent, but a more wild
and romantic appearance of water, and at the
same time strictly natural, is what I never saw in
any place whatever. This scene, though com∣paratively
small, is yet aggrandized with so
much art, that we forget the quantity of water
which flows through this close and overshaded
vally; and are so much transported with the in∣tricacy
of scene, and the concealed height from
whence it flows, that we, without reflection, add
the idea of magnificence to that of beauty. In
short, it is not but upon reflection that we find
the stream is not a Niagara, but rather a waterfal
in miniature; and that the same artifice, upon
a larger scale, were there large trees instead of
small ones, and a river instead of a rill, it would
be capable of forming a scene that would
exceed the utmost of our ideas. But I will not
dwell longer upon this inimitable scene; those
who would admire it properly must view it, as
<PB N="342" REF="340"/>
surely as those that view it must admire it beyond
almost any thing they ever saw.</P>
<P>PROCEEDING on the right hand path, the next
seat affords a scene of what Mr. Shenstone used to
call his forest ground, consisting of wild green
slopes peeping through dingle, or irregular
groups of trees, a confused mixture of savage
and cultivated ground, held up to the eye, and
forming a landskip fit for the pencil of Salvator
Rosa.</P>
<P>WINDING on beside this lawn, which is over∣arched
with spreading trees, the eye catches at
intervals, over an intermediate hill, the spire of
Hales church, forming here a perfect Obelisk—the
urn to Mr. Somerville, &amp;c. And now passing
through a kind of thicket we arrive at a (N° 13)
natural bower of almost circular oaks inscribed
in the manner following,
<Q><L>To Mr. DODSLEY,</L>
<L>Come then, my friend, thy sylvan taste display,</L>
<L>Come hear thy Faunus tune his rustic lay;</L>
<L>Ah, rather come, and in these dells disown</L>
<L>The care of other strains, and tune thine own.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="341"/>
ON the bank above it, amid the fore-mentioned
shrubs, is a statue of the piping (N° 14) fawn,
which not only embellishes this scene, but is
also seen from the court before the house, and
from other places. It is surrounded by venerable
oaks, and very happily situated. From this
bower also you look down upon the fore-men∣tioned
irregular ground shut up with trees on all
sides, except some few openings to the more
pleasing parts of this grotesque and hilly coun∣try.
The next little (N° 15) bench affords the first,
but, not most striking, view of the Priory. It is
indeed a small building; but seen as it is be∣neath
trees, and it's extremity also hid by the
same, it has in some sort the dignity and solemn
appearance of a larger edifice.</P>
<P>PASSING through a gate, we enter a small
open grove, where the first seat we find affords
a picturesque view, through trees, of a clump
of oaks at a distance, over-shadowing a little
cottage upon a green hill. We thence imme∣diately
enter a perfect dome or circular tem∣ple
of magnificent beeches, in the center of
which it was intended to place an antique altar, or
a statue of Pan. The path, serpentizing through
<PB N="344" REF="342"/>
this open grove, leads us by an easy ascent to a
(N<SUP>o</SUP> 16) small bench with this motto,
<Q><L>Me gelidum nemus</L>
<L>Nympharumque leves cum satyris chori</L>
<L>Secernant populo. HOR.</L></Q>
which alludes to the retired situation of the
grove. There is also seen, through an opening
to the left, a pleasing landskip of a distant hill,
with a whited farm-house upon the summit; and
to the right a beautiful round slope, crowned
with a clump of large firs, with a pyramidal seat
on it's center; to which, after no long walk, the
path conducts us.</P>
<P>BUT we first come to another view of the Priory,
more advantageous, and at a better distance, to
which the eye is led down a green slope, through
a scenery of tall oaks, in a most agreeable man∣ner;
the grove we have just past on one side,
and a hill of trees and thicket on the other;
conducting the eye to a narrow opening through
which it appears.</P>
<P>WE now ascend to a (N° 17) a small bench
where the circumjacent country begins to open;
in particular a glass-house appears between two
<PB N="345" REF="343"/>
large clumps of trees, at about the distance of
four miles: The glass-houses in this country not
ill resembling a distant pyramid. Ascending to
the next seat, which is in the gothic form, the
scene grows more and more extended; woods
and lawns, hills and vallies, thicket and plain,
agreeably intermingled. On the back of this
seat is the following beautiful inscription, which
the author told me that he chose to fix here, to
supply what he thought some want of life in this
part of the farm, and to keep up the spectator's
attention till he came to scale the hill beyond.</P>

</LG>
<P><PB N="348" REF="346"/>
AND now palling through a wicket, the path
winds up the back part of a circular green hill,
discovering little of the country till you enter a
a clump of stately firs upon the summit. Over∣arched
by these firs is an octagonal (N° 18)
seat, the back of which is so contrived as to form
a table or pedestal for a bowl or goblet thus
inscribed—
<Q>“To all friends round the Wrekin!”</Q>
This facetious inscription, being an old Shrop∣shire
health, is a commemoration of his country
friends, from which this part of Shropshire is di∣vided.
Add to this, that the Wrekin, that large
and venerable hill, appears full in front at the
distance of about thirty miles.</P>
<P>THE scene is a very fine one, divided by the
firs into several compartiments, each answering
to the octagonal seat in the center, to each of
which is allotted a competent number of striking
objects to make a complete picture. A long ser∣pentine
stream washes the foot of this hill, and is
lost behind trees at one end, and a bridge thrown
over at the other. Over this the eye is carried
from very romantic home scenes to very beauti∣ful
<PB N="349" REF="347"/>
ones at a distance. It is impossible to give an
idea of that immense variety, that fine configu∣ration
of parts, which engage our attention from
this place. In one of the compartiments you
have a simple scene of a cottage, and a road
winding behind a farm-house half covered with
trees upon the top of some wild sloping ground;
and in another a view of the town, appearing
from hence as upon the shelving banks of a large
piece of water in the flat. Suffice it to say,
that the hill and vale, plain and woodland, vil∣lages
and single houses, blue distant mountains
that skirt the horizon, and green hills romanti∣cally
jumbled that form the intermediate ground,
make this spot more than commonly striking—nor
is there to be seen an acre of level ground
through the large extent to which, the eye is
carried.</P>
<P>HENCE the path winds on betwixt two small
benches, each of which exhibits a pleasing land∣skip,
which cannot escape the eye of a con∣noisseur.</P>
<P>HERE we wind through a (N° 19) small
thicket, and soon enter a cavity in the hill, filled
with trees, in the center of which is a seat, from
whence is discovered, gleaming across the trees,
<PB N="350" REF="348"/>
a considerable length of the serpentine stream
before-mentioned, running under a slight rustic
bridge to the right. Hence we ascend in a kind
of Gothic (N° 20) alcove, looking down a slope,
sided with large oaks and tall beeches, which
together over-arch the scene. On the back of this
building is found the following</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="351" REF="349"/>
<HEAD>INSCRIPTION.</HEAD>
<LG>

</LG>
<P><PB N="352" REF="350"/>
BELOW this alcove is a large sloping lawn finely
bounded, crossed by the serpentine water before∣mentioned,
and interspersed with single, or
clumps of oaks at agreeable distances. Further
on, the scene is finely varied; the hills rising and
falling towards the opposite concavities, by the
side of a long winding vale, with the most grace∣ful
confusion. Among other scenes that form
this landskip, a fine hanging wood, backed and
contrasted with a wild heath, intersected with
cross roads, is a very considerable object. Near
adjoining to this, is a seat from whence the water
is seen to advantage in many different stages of
it's progress: Or where (as a poetical friend once
observed) the proprietor has taken the Naiad by
the hand, and led her an irregular dance into
the valley.</P>
<P>PROCEEDING hence through a (N° 21) wicket,
we enter upon another lawn, beyond which is a
new theatre of wild shaggy precipices, hanging
coppice ground, and smooth round hills between,
being not only different, but even of an opposite
character to the ground from which we passed.
Walking along the head of this lawn, we come
to a (N° 22) seat under a spreading beech, with
this
<Q><PB N="353" REF="351"/>
INSCRIPTION.</Q>
<Q><L>Hoc erat in votis: modus agri non ita magnus,</L>
<L>Hortus ubi, et tecto vicinus jugis aquae fons,</L>
<L>Et paulum sylvae super his foret. Auctius atque</L>
<L>Dii melius fecere—</L></Q></P>
<P>IN the center of the hanging lawn before you,
is discovered the house, half hid with trees and
bushes. A little hanging wood, and a piece of
winding water, issues through a noble clump of
large oaks and spreading beeches. At the di∣stance
of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stam∣ford's
grounds appear, and beyond these the
Clee Hills in Shropshire. The scene here con∣sists
of admirably varied ground, and is, I think, a
very fine one. Hence passing still a-long the top
of the lawn, we cross another gate, and behind
the fence begin to descend into the valley.
About half way down is a (N° 23) small bench,
which throws the eye upon a near scene of hang∣ing
woods and shaggy wild declivities, inter∣mixt
with smooth green slopes and scenes of cul∣tivation.</P>
<P>WE now return again into the great lawn at
bottom, and soon come to a (N° 24) seat, which
<PB N="354" REF="352"/>
gives a nearer view of the water before-men∣tioned,
between the trunks of high over-sha∣dowing
oaks and beeches; beyond which the
winding line of trees is continued down the val∣ley
to the right. To the left at a distance
the top of Clent Hill appears, and the houfe
upon a swell, amidst trees and bushes. In the
center, the eye is carried by a sideling view down
a length of lawn, till it rests upon the town and
spire of Hales, with some picturesque and beau∣tiful
ground rising behind it.</P>
<P>SOMEWHAT out of the path, and in the
center of a noble clump of stately beeches is
a (N° 25) seat inscribed to Mr. Spence in these
words.</P>
<Q><L>IOSEPHO SPENCE,</L>
<L>EXIMIO NOSTRO CRITONI;</L>
<L>CVI DICARI VELLET</L>
<L>MVSARVM OMNIVM ET GRATARVM CHORVS,</L>
<L>DICAT AMICITIA.</L>
<L>MDCCLVIII.</L></Q>
<P>We now through a small gate enter what is
called the Lover's (N° 26) Walk, and proceed
immediately to a seat where the water is seen
very advantageously at full length; which,
<PB N="355" REF="353"/>
though not large, is so agreeably shaped, and
has it's bounds so well concealed, that the be∣holder
may receive less pleasure from many lakes
of greater extent. The margin on one side is
fringed with alders, the other is over-hung with
most stately oaks and beeches, and the middle
beyond the water presents the Hales Owen
scene, with a group of houses on the slope be∣hind,
and the horison well fringed with the wood.
Now winding a few paces round the margin of
the water, we come to another small bench,
which presents the former scene somewhat va∣ried,
with the addition of a whited village among
trees upon a hill: Proceeding on, we enter the
pleasing gloom of this agreeable walk, and
come to a (N° 27) bench beneath a spreading
beech that over-hangs both walk and water,
which has been called the Assignation seat, and
has this inscription on the back of it.</P>
<Q><L>Nerine Galatea! thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae,</L>
<L>Candidior cygnis, hedera formosior alba!</L>
<L>Cum primum pasti repetent praesepia tauri,</L>
<L>Si qua tui Corydonis habet te cura, venito.</L></Q>
<P>Here the path begins gradually to ascend beneath
a depth of shade, by the side of which is a small
bubbling rill, either forming little peninsula's,
<PB N="356" REF="354"/>
rolling over pebbles, or falling down small cas∣cades,
all under cover, and taught to murmur
very agreeably. This very soft and pensive
scene, very properly stiled the Lover's Walk, is
terminated with an ornamented (N 28) urn, inscribed
to Miss Dolman, a beautiful and amiable relation
of Mr. Shenstone's, who died of the small-pox,
about twenty-one years of age, in the following
words on one side:
<Q><L>PERAMABILI SVAE CONSOBRINAE</L>
<L>M. D.</L>
<L>On the other side.</L>
<L>AH MARIA</L>
<L>PVELLARVM ELEGANTISSIMA,</L>
<L>AH FLORE VENVSTATIS ABREPTA,</L>
<L>VALE!</L>
<L>HEV QVANTO MINVS EST</L>
<L>CVM RELIQVIS VERSARI,</L>
<L>QVAM TVI</L>
<L>MEMINISSE!</L></Q></P>
<P>THE ascent from hence winds somewhat more
steeply to another (N° 29) seat, where the eye
is thrown over a rough scene of broken and furzy
ground; upon a piece of water in the flat, whose
extremities are hid behind trees and shrubs, amongst
which the house appears, and makes upon the whole
<PB N="357" REF="355"/>
no unpleasing picture. The path still winds un∣der
cover up the hill, the steep declivity of
which is somewhat eased by the serpentine sweep
of it, till we come to a small bench with this
line from Pope's Eloisa;
<Q>“Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!”</Q>
The opening before it presents a solitary scene
of trees, thickets, and precipice, and terminates
upon a green hill, with a clump of firs on the
top of it.</P>
<P>WE now find the great use as well as beauty
of the serpentine path in climbing up this wood.
The first seat of which, alluding to the rural
scene before it, has the following lines from
Virgil.</P>
<Q><L>—Hic latis otia fundis</L>
<L>Speluncae, vivique lacus, hic frigida Tempe,</L>
<L>Mugitusque boum, mollesque sub arbore somni.</L></Q>
<P>Here the eye looking down a slope beneath the
spreading arms of oak and beech trees, passes
first over some rough furzy ground, then over
water to the large swelling lawn, in the center
of which the house is discovered among trees
and thickets. This forms the fore ground. Be∣yond
<PB N="358" REF="356"/>
this appears a swell of waste furzy land,
diversified with a cottage, and a road that winds
behind a farm-house, and a fine clump of trees.
The back scene of all is a semicircular range of
hills diversified with wood, scenes of cultivation,
and enclosures, to about four or five miles
distance.</P>
<P>STILL winding up into the wood, we come to
a slight seat opening through the trees to a
bridge of five piers, crossing a large piece of
water at about half a mile's distance. The next
seat looks down from a considerable height, along
the side of a steep precipice, upon some irregular
and pleasing ground. And now we turn upon a
sudden into a long strait lined walk in the wood,
arched over with tall trees, and terminating with
a small rustic building. Though the walk, as I
said, be strait-lined, yet the base rises and falls
so agreeably, as leaves no room to censure it's
formality. About the middle of this avenue,
which runs the whole length of this hanging
wood, we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty (N° 30)
gothic seat, whence we look down a slope, more
considerable than that before-mentioned, through
the wood on each side. This view is indeed a
fine one: The eye first travelling down over
well-variegated ground into the valley, where is
<PB N="359" REF="357"/>
a large piece of water, whose sloping banks give
all the appearance of a noble river. The ground
from hence rises gradually to the top of Clent
Hill, at three or four miles distance, and the
landskip is enriched with a view of Hales Owen,
the late Lord Dudley's house, and a large wood
of Lord Lyttelton's. It is impossible to give an
adequate description of this view, the beauty of it
depending npon the great variety of objects, and
beautiful shape of ground; and all at such a
distance as to admit of being seen distinctly.</P>
<P>HENCE we proceed to the (N° 31) rustic
building before-mentioned, a slight and unexpen∣sive
edifice, formed of rough unhewn stone, com∣monly
called here the Temple of Pan; having a
trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx, and this inscrip∣tion
over the entrance,
<Q><L>Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures</L>
<L>Edocuit; Pan curat oves, oviumque magistros.</L></Q>
Hence mounting once more to the right through
this dark umbrageous walk, we enter at once
upon a lightsome high natural terrace, whence
the eye is thrown over all the scenes we have
seen before, together with many fine additional
ones, and all beheld from a declivity that ap∣proaches
<PB N="360" REF="358"/>
as near a precipice as is agreeable.
In the middle is a (N° 32) seat with this in∣scription:
<Q>DIVINI GLORIA RVRIS!</Q>
To give a better idea of this, by far the most
magnificent scene here, it were, perhaps, best to
divide it into two distinct parts—the noble con∣cave
in the front, and the rich valley towards
the right—In regard to the former; if a boon
companion could enlarge his idea of a punch∣bowl,
ornamented within with all the romantic
scenery the Chinese ever yet devised, it would,
perhaps, afford him the highest idea he could
possibly conceive of earthly happiness. He would
certainly wish to swim in it. Suffice it to say,
that the horison, or brim, is as finely varied as
the cavity. It would be idle here to mention the
Clee Hills, the Wrekin, the Welsh Mountains,
or Caer Caradoc, at a prodigious distance; which
though they finish the scene agreeably, should
not be mentioned at the Leasowes, the beauty
of which turns chiefly upon distinguishable scenes.
The valley upon the right is equally enriched,
and the opposite side thereof well fringed with
woods; and the high hills on one side this long
winding vale rolling agreeably into the hollows
<PB N="361" REF="359"/>
on the other. But these are a kind of objects,
which, though really noble in the survey, will
not strike a reader in description, as they would
a spectator upon the spot.</P>
<P>HENCE returning back into the wood, and
crossing Pan's temple, we go directly down the
slope, into another part of Mr. Shenstone's grounds,
the path leading down through very pleasing
home scenes of well-shaped ground, exhibiting a
most perfect concave and convex, till we come at
a seat under a noble beech, presenting a rich
variety of fore-ground, and at, perhaps, half a
mile's distance, the gothic alcove on a hill well
covered with wood, a pretty cottage under trees
in the more distant part of the concave, and a
farm-house upon the right, all picturesque ob∣jects.</P>
<P>THE (N° 33) next and the subsequent seat afford
pretty much the same scenes a little enlarged;
with the addition of that remarkable clump of
trees, called Frankly Beeches, adjoining to the
old family seat of the Lyttelton's, and from
whence the present Lord Lyttelton derives his
title.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="360"/>
WE come now to an handsome (N° 34) gothic
screen, backed with a clump of firs, which throws
the eye in front full upon a cascade in the valley,
issuing from beneath a dark shade of poplars.
The house appears in the center of a large
swelling lawn, bushed with trees and thicket.
The pleasing variety of easy swells and hollows,
bounded by scenes less smooth and cultivated, af∣fords
the most delightful picture of domestic re∣tirement
and tranquillity.</P>
<P>WE now descend to a (N° 35) seat enclosed
with handsome pales, and backed with firs, in∣scribed
to Lord Lyttelton. It presents a beauti∣ful
view up a valley contracted gradually, and
ending in a group of most magnificent oaks and
beeches. The right hand side is enlivened with
two striking cascades, and a winding stream seen
at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland.
To the left appears the hanging wood already
mentioned, with the gothic screen on the slope
in the center.</P>
<P>WINDING still downwards, we come to a (N° 36)
small seat, where one of the offices of the house,
and a view of a cottage on very high ground, is
seen over the tops of the trees of the grove in the
<PB N="363" REF="361"/>
adjacent valley, giving an agreeable instance of the
abrupt inequality of ground in this romantic well∣variegated
country. The next (N° 37) seat shews
another face of the same valley, the water
gliding calmly along betwixt two seeming groves
without any cascade, as a contrast to the former
one where it was broken by cascades. The scene
very significantly alluded to by the motto:
<Q><L>“Rura mihi, et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes,</L>
<L>Flumina amem, silvasque inglorius!”</L></Q></P>
<P>WE descend now to a beautiful gloomy scene,
called Virgil's Grove, where on the entrance we
pass by a small obelisk on the right hand with
this inscription:
<Q><L>P. VIRGILIO MARONI</L>
<L>LAPIS ISTE CVM LVCO SACER ESTO.</L></Q>
Before this is a slight bench, where some of the
same objects are seen again, but in a different
point of light. It is not very easy either to paint
or describe this delightful grove: however, as
the former has been more than once attempted,
I will hope to apologize for an imperfect descrip∣tion,
by the difficulty found by those who have
aimed to sketch it with their pencil. Be it, there∣fore,
first observed, that the whole scene is opake
<PB N="364" REF="362"/>
and gloomy, consisting of a small deep valley or
dingle; the sides of which are inclosed with irre∣gular
tufts of hazel and other underwood; and
the whole over-shadowed with lofty trees rising
out of the bottom of the dingle, through which
a copious stream makes it's way through mossy
banks, enamelled with prim roses, and variety of
wild wood flowers. The (N° 38) first seat we
approach is thus inscribed,
<Q>CELEBERRIMO POETAE
IACOBO THOMSON
PROPE FONTES ILLI NON FASTIDITOS
G. S.
SEDEM HANC ORNAVIT.</Q>
<Q><L>Quae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona?</L>
<L>Nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri,</L>
<L>Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam litora, nee quae</L>
<L>Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles.</L></Q>
This seat is placed upon a steep bank on the edge
of the valley; from which the eye is here drawn
down into the flat below, by the light that glim∣mers
in front, and by the sound of various cas∣cades,
by which the winding stream is agreeably
broken. Opposite to this seat the ground rises
again in an easy concave to a kind of dripping
<PB N="365" REF="363"/>
fountain, where a small rill trickles down a rude
nich of rock work, through fern, liverwort, and
aquatick weeds. The green area in the middle
through which the stream winds, being as well
shaped as can be imagined. After falling down
these cascades, it winds under a bridge of one
arch, and then empties itself into a small lake
which catches it a little below. This terminates
the scene upon the right, and after these objects
have for some time amused the spectator, his
eye rambles to the left, where one of the most
beautiful cascades imaginable is seen by way of
incident, through a kind of vista, or glade, falling
down a precipice over-arched with trees, and
strikes us with surprize. It is impossible to express
the pleasure which one feels on this occasion, for
though surprize alone is not excellence, it may
serve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful.
I believe none ever beheld this grove, without a
thorough sense of satisfaction; and were one to
chuse any one particular spot of this perfectly Ar∣cadian
farm, it should, perhaps, be this; although
it so well contrasts both with the terrace and with
some other scenes, that one cannot wish them ever
to be divided. We now proceed to a seat at the
bottom of a large root on the side of a slope, with
this inscription,
<Q><PB N="366" REF="364"/>
<LG>
<L>O let me haunt this peaceful shade;</L>
<L>Nor let ambition e'er invade</L>
<L>The tenants of this leafy bower</L>
<L>That shun her paths, and slight her power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the peaceful Halcyon flies</L>
<L>From social meads, and open skies;</L>
<L>Pleas'd by this rill her course to steer,</L>
<L>And hide her sapphire plumage here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The trout bedropt with crimson stains,</L>
<L>Forsakes the river's proud domains;</L>
<L>Forsakes the sun's unwelcome gleam,</L>
<L>To lurk within, this humble stream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sure I hear the Naiad say,</L>
<L>“Flow, flow, my stream, this devious way,</L>
<L>“Tho' lovely soft thy murmurs are,</L>
<L>Thy waters lovely cool and fair.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Flow, gentle stream, nor let the vain</L>
<L>Thy small unsully'd stores disdain:</L>
<L>Nor let the pensive sage repine,</L>
<L>Whose latent course resembles thine.”</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="365"/>
THE view from it is a calm tranquil scene of
water, gliding through sloping ground, with a
sketch through the trees of the small pond be∣low.</P>
<P>THE scene in this place is that of water steal∣ing
along through a rude sequestered vale, the
ground on each side covered with weeds and field∣flowers,
as that before is kept close-shaven. Farther
on we lose all sight of water, and only hear the
noise, without having the appearance; a kind of
effect which the Chinese are fond of producing
in what they call their scenes of enchantment.
We now turn all on a sudden upon the high
cascade which we admired before in vista. The
scene around is quite a grotto of native stone
running up it, roots of trees over-hanging it,
and the whole shaded over head. However, we
first approach upon the left a chalybeat spring,
with an iron bowl chained to it, and this inscrip∣tion
a stone,
<Q>FONS FERRVGINEVS
DIVAE QVAE SECESSV ISTO FRVI CONCEDIT.</Q>
Then turning to the right, we find a stone seat
making part of the aforesaid cave, with this
well-applied inscription,
<Q><PB N="368" REF="366"/>
<L>INTVS AQVAE DVLCIS, VIVOQVE SEDILIA SAXO;</L>
<L>NYMPHARVM DOMVS.</L></Q>
Which I have often heard Mr. Shenstone term
the definition of a grotto. We now wind up a
shady path on the left hand, and crossing the
head of this cascade, pass beside the river that
supplies it, in bur way up to the house. One
seat first occurs under a shady oak as we ascend
the hill; soon after, we enter the shrubbery
which half surrounds the house, where we find
two seats thus inscribed, to two of his most par∣ticular
friends. The first thus,
<Q><L>AMICITIAE ET MERITIS</L>
<L>RICHARDI GRAVES:</L>
<L>IPSAE TE, TITYRE, PINVS,</L>
<L>IPSI TE FONTES, IPSA HAEC ARBVSTA VOCABANT.</L></Q>
And a little further the other, with the following
inscription,
<Q><L>AMICITIAE ET MERITIS</L>
<L>RICHARDI JAGO.</L></Q>
From this last is an opening down the valley
over a large sliding lawn, well edged with oaks,
to a piece of water crossed by a considerable
<PB N="369" REF="367"/>
bridge in the flat—the steeple of Hales, a vil∣lage
amid trees, making on the whole a very
pleasing picture. Thus winding through flower∣ing
shrubs, beside a menagerie for doves, we
are conducted to the stables. But let it not be
forgot, that on the entrance into this shrubbery,
the first object that strikes us is a Venus de Medi∣cis,
beside a bason of gold fish, encompassed
round with shrubs, and illustrated with the fol∣lowing
inscription,
<Q><PB N="370" REF="368"/>
<LG>
<L>“—Semi-reducta Venus.”</L>

<L>Stark-naked, or but wreath'd with flowers,</L>
<L>Lie slumbering soft beneath his bowers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wak'd by the stock-dove's melting strain,</L>
<L>Behold them rise! and, with the train</L>
<L>Of nymphs that haunt the stream or grove,</L>
<L>Or o'er the flowery champion rove,</L>
<L>Join hand in hand—attentive gaze—</L>
<L>And mark the dance's mystic maze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Such is the WAVING LINE, they cry,</L>
<L>For ever dear to Fancy's eye!</L>
<L>Yon stream that wanders down the dale,</L>
<L>The spiral wood, the winding vale,</L>
<L><PB N="385" REF="382"/>
The path which wrought with hidden skill,</L>
<L>Slow twining scales yon distant hill</L>
<L>With fir inverted—all combine</L>
<L>To recommend the WAVING LINE.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“The wreathed rod of Bacchus fair,</L>
<L>The wringlets of Apollo's hair,</L>
<L>The wand by Maia's offspring born,</L>
<L>The smooth volutes of Ammon's horn,</L>
<L>The structure of the Cyprian dame,</L>
<L>And each fair female's beauteous frame,</L>
<L>Shew, to the pupils of Design,</L>
<L>The triumphs of the WAVING LINE.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then gaze, and mark that union sweet,</L>
<L>Where fair convex and concave meet;</L>
<L>And while, quick shifting as you stray,</L>
<L>The vivid scenes on fancy play;</L>
<L>The lawn, of aspect smooth and mild;</L>
<L>The forrest ground, grotesque and wild;</L>
<L>The shrub that scents the mountain gale;</L>
<L>The stream rough dashing down the dale,</L>
<L>From rock to rock, in eddies tost;</L>
<L>The distant lake in which 'tis lost;</L>
<L>Blue hills gay beaming thro' the glade;</L>
<L>Lone urns that solemnize the shade;</L>
<L>Sweet interchange of all that charms</L>
<L>In groves, meads, dingles, rivulets, farms!</L>
<L><PB N="386" REF="383"/>
If aught the fair confusion please,</L>
<L>Wish lasting health, and lasting ease.</L>
<L>To him who form'd the blissful bower,</L>
<L>And gave thy life one tranquil hour;</L>
<L>Wish peace and freedom—these possest,</L>
<L>His temperate minds secures the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if thy soul such bliss despise,</L>
<L>Avert thy dull incurious eyes;</L>
<L>Go fix them there, where gems and gold,</L>
<L>Improv'd by art, their power unfold;</L>
<L>Go try in courtly scenes to trace</L>
<L>A fairer form of Nature's face;</L>
<L>Go scorn SIMPLICITY—but know,</L>
<L>That all our heart-felt joys below,</L>
<L>That all which virtue loves to name,</L>
<L>Which art consigns to lasting fame,</L>
<L>Which fixes wit or beauty's throne,</L>
<L>Derives its source from HER ALONE.</L>

<L>COME, shepherds, we'll follow the hearse,</L>
<L>And see our lov'd Corydon laid:</L>
<L>Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse,</L>
<L>Yet let the sad tribute be paid.</L>
<L>They call'd him the pride of the plain:</L>
<L>In sooth, he was gentle and kind;</L>
<L>He mark'd in his elegant strain,</L>
<L>The Graces that glow'd in his mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>On purpose he planted yon trees,</L>
<L>That birds in the covert might dwell;</L>
<L>He cultur'd his thyme for the bees,</L>
<L>But never would rifle their cell.</L>
<L>Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,</L>
<L>Go bleat—and your master bemoan:</L>
<L>His music was artless and sweet,</L>
<L>His manners as mild as your own.</L>

<L>His Phillis was fond of his praise,</L>

<L>Ye shepherds, henceforward be mute,</L>
