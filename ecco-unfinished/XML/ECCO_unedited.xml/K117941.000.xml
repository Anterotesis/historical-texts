<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>IN this blest land, thro' ev'ry varying age,</L>
<L>Public and private life have had <HI>their rage.</HI></L>
<L>In good King Arthur's days, with cumb'rous shield,</L>
<L>The Iron champions pranc'd upon the field,</L>
<L>Relentless beauty bade the knights advance,</L>
<L>And bear the rage romantic on their lance.</L>
<L>From length of time this fury found it's death,</L>
<L>And wiser fashions mark'd Elizabeth.</L>
<L>Her modest dames were form'd of mildest stuff,</L>
<L>But check'd presumption by a monstrous ruff,</L>
<L>Their breakfast <HI>rage</HI> all delicacy shocks,</L>
<L>Early they pick'd the pinions of an ox,</L>
<L>Then rode in state behind the scepter'd fair,</L>
<L>On horse-back—full as well as my Lord Mayor.</L>
<L>These modes howe'er are alter'd, and of late,</L>
<L>Beef, but not modesty is out of date;</L>
<L>For now instead of rich sirloins, we see,</L>
<L>Green calipash, and yellow callipee;</L>
<L>Now ladies shine from Phaetons afar,</L>
<L>And very soon perhaps may learn to spar;</L>
<L>At leisure hours they work settees, and chairs,</L>
<L>Or waste their youth on puddings, or on prayers,</L>
<L>Each modest dame may quit her cara sposa,</L>
<L>To take a hug with Humphries or Mendoza.</L>
<L>As thus the manners differ, writers try,</L>
<L>To trace the whimsical variety,</L>
<L>With observation just, and mirror true,</L>
<L>Present each reigning solly to the view.</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>Yet, hold, our author's scene all <HI>rage</HI> outgoes,</L>
<L>A new, excentric character he shews;</L>
<L>No doughty Quixotte, and no modern fighter,</L>
<L>A dramatizing hero, play—inditer,</L>
<L>One who to gain applause, like wits in vogue,</L>
<L>Torments with Prologue, or with Epilogue.</L>
<L>At every house with <HI>incident</HI> he meets</L>
<L>And thinks he sees processions—in the streets,</L>
<L>In common life will unities expect</L>
<L>Looks up to politics for stage effect,</L>
<L>And so misled, that if his wife should die,</L>
<L>"She's made a charming exit," he would cry.</L>
<L>But let me not our Comedy forestal,</L>
<L>Or court your judgment till the curtain fall,</L>
<L>Mean while we'll strive your patience to beguile</L>
<L>And win from loveliest lips the bright'ning smile.</L>
<L>Such as it is we give it to your view,</L>
<L>And trust <HI>our cause to candour,</HI> and to you.</L>

<P>BUT I tell you I will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out—I didn't come to Bath to be conf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I won't—I hate all their company but sweet Miss Courtney's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I declare Miss Marianne, you grow worse and worse every day, your country manners will be the ruin of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk about that Letty, it was a shame to bring me up in the country! If I had been properly taken care of I might have done great things, I might have mar∣ried the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et I danc'd with at the ball, but it's all over now—I shall never get a husband, and what's worse my aunt did it on purpose! She ruin'd me, Letty, that no∣body else might.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you talk! I hope Miss Courtney hasn't taught you all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, she's a dear creature! she has taught me many things but nothing improper, I'm sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray has she taught you why she never plays any tune but the one we heard just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and if you'll keep it a secret I'll tell you, Letty; Mr Harry Neville taught it her last summer, and now she is always playing it because it puts her in mind of the dear man, when it is ended don't you observe how she sighs from the bottom of her dear little heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I thought they had quarrell'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they have, she won't see him, and I believe my aunt Lady Waitfort has been the occasion of it; Poor Mr Neville! I wish I could assist him! for indeed Letty,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>I always pity any body that has been cross'd in love—it may be one's own case one day or other, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and for the same reason, I suppose you rejoice when it is successful? I am sure now the intended marriage of Lady Waitfort and Lord Scratch gives you pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the country gentleman who has lately come to the title? no if you'll believe me I don't like him at all, he's a sour old fellow, is always abusing our sex, and thinks there is only one good woman under Heaven, now I'm sure that's a mistake; for I know I'm a good woman, and I think, Letty, you are another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I hope so, tho' I confess I think your aunt a better than either of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>More shame for you, she is a woman of senti∣ment, and hums you over with her sentiments and flou∣rishes about purity and feelings! faith she ought to be ashamed of herself! no other woman would talk in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake her, she is a woman of virtue, and can't help feeling for the vices and misfortunes of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why can't she do as I have done, Letty? keep her feelings to herself — If I had given way to them half as much as she has—Oh Lord! I don't know what might have been the consequences?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame! you never hear Lady Waitfort speak ill of any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, how shou'd she, when she speaks of nobody but herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well your opinion is of little weight—my lord sees her merit, and is come to Bath on purpose to marry her—He thinks her a prodigy of goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray let him have her; every fool knows; so to be sure does he Letty, that a prodigy of goodness is a very rare thing — but when he finds her out? faith it will be a rare joke when he finds her out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shameful, Miss Marianne! pray do speak a lit∣tle intelligibly, and remember your aunt's favourite ob∣servation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, I have forgot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>That good sentiments are always plain.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so are good women—bid her remember that, Letty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! say no more, here she comes, and Mr Willoughby with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that man is always with her of late, but come Letty, let's get out of her way, let's take a walk and look at the Beaux.</P>
</SP>

<P>The beaux! ah, I see you long to become a woman of fashion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your ladyship is certain Harry Neville is returned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the ungrateful man arrived last night, and as I yet mean to consult his happiness, I have writ∣ten to him to come to me this evening, but I will ever oppose his union with my Lord's ward, Louisa Courtney, because I think it will be the ruin of them both; and you know, Willoughby, one cannot forget their feeling on these occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—but Ennui the time killer whose only being in life is to murder the hours is also just arrived, and my Lord is resolved on his marrying Louisa instantly, only because he'll make a quiet member for his borough in the west.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but for various reasons, I am deter∣mined she shall be yours, yet it must be done artfully—my circumstances are derang'd and an alliance with my Lord is my only hope of relief, such are the fruits of virtue, Willoughby!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but her fortune is entirely dependant on my lord's consent, and how is that to be obtained? You know I'm no favourite, and Floriville is a great one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it—and therefore we must incense him against Floriville—let me see, can't we contrive some mode—some little ingenious story—he is a singular cha∣racter you know, and has violent prejudices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and of all his prejudices, none are so violent or so entertaining as that against authors and ac∣tors.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the stage is his aversion, and some way or other—I have it—it's an odd thought, but may do much, suppose we tell him Floriville has written a <HI>play?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The luckiest thought in the world, it will make him hate him directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, leave it to me—I'll explain the mat∣ter to myself, and my life on't it proves successful; you see Willoughby my only system is to promote happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed Lady Waitfort—but if this, fails, may I still hope for your interest with Miss Courtney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm determined she shall be yours and neither Neville's nor Ennui's—but come it's late, and here he is, we'll get rid of him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ENNUI.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. WAIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr Ennui, your servant, we were going to the parade—have you seen your cousin Neville?</P>

<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea—I've just left him.</P>

<P>I suppose we shall see you at lady Walton's in the evening—till when adieu.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exeunt.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea, I don't like this lady Waitfort, she wishes to trick me out of my match with Miss Courtney, and if I could trick her in return — <STAGE><HI>(takes out his watch)</HI></STAGE> how goes the <HI>enemy?</HI> Only one o'clock—thought it had been that an hour ago—heigho!—here's my patron Lord Scratch.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lord SCRATCH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wonderful virtue in the art of hear∣ing, may I die if a listener is to be found any where— zounds! am not I a peer, and don't I talk by prerogative? and if I mayn't talk ten times as much as another per∣son what's the use of my peerage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea—I don't comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fellow Neville, wouldn't hear a word I had to say! abandoned young dog! he's come to Bath to invent tales against that divinity lady Waitfort, again, I suppose. But my ward Louisa shall be put out of his power for ever. She shall marry you to morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In fact I always forget to give your lordship joy of your title, tho' not of your dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not of my dress! ay, ay—there's the difference—you poor devils in humble life are obliged to
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>dress well to look like gentlemen—we peers may dress as we please <STAGE><HI>(looking at his watch)</HI></STAGE> but I shall lose my ap∣pointment—past two o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Past two o'clock! delightful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful! what at your old tricks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea—it had been only one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you're delighted because it is an hour later.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure I am my dear friend—to be sure I am—the enemy has lost a limb!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you are happier because you're an hour nearer the other world! Tell me now do you wish to die?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I wish somebody would invent a new mode of killing time—in fact, I think I've found one— private acting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Acting! never talk to me about the stage —I detest the theatre and every thing that belongs to it —and if ever—but no matter—I must to Lady Waitfort and prevail on her to marry me, at the same time you marry my ward—but remember our agreement—you are to settle your estate on Louisa, and I am to bring you into parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In fact I comprehend—I am to be a hearer and not a speaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speaker? if you open your mouth the Chiltern Hundreds will be your portion—look'ye—you are to be led gently to the right side—to sleep during the debate—give a nod for your vote, and in every respect move like a mandarine at my command—in short you are to be a mandarine member, so farewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea, here's Neville! In fact he knows nothing of my marrying Louisa—nor shall he till after the happy day. Strange news Neville!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've heard it all, Louisa' going to be married, and my lord persists in his fatal atrachment to Lady Wait∣fort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In fact! why fatal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it is the source of every mischief—while she maintains her power over him, I have no hope of love or fortune—when my father died, he left his estate
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>to my brother relying on my lord providing for me, and now he deserts me and all owing to the artifices of an in∣siduous woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea, I comprehend her motive. She loves you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, 'tis too plain, and because I would not li∣sten to her advances, she has ruined me in my uncle's o∣pinion, and degraded me in Louisa's; but I will see Miss Courtney myself, I will hear my doom from her own mouth, and if the avoids me, I'll leave her and this country for ever.</P>

<P>Without a direction! What can it mean?</P>

<P>Sir, 'tis from Lady Waitfort, the servant who brought it said her ladyship had reasons for not directing it, which she would explain to you when she saw you.</P>

<P>Oh the old stratagem, as it is not directed she may swear it was designed for another person, <STAGE><HI>(reads)</HI></STAGE> <Q>“Sir, I have heard of your arrival at Bath, and strange as my conduct may appear, I think it a duty I owe the virtuous part of mankind to promote their happi∣ness as much as I can, I have long beheld your merit and long wish'd to encourage it, I shall be at home at six this evening—Your's ”A.

<P>If I shew it to my lord, I know his bigotry is such that he wou'd (as usual) only suppose it a trick of my own, the more cause there is to condemn, the more he approves.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In fact—pick up!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he has the ardor seribendi upon him so strong, that he wou'd rather you'd ask him to write an Epilogue to a new play than offer him your whole estate. The theatre is his world, in which are included all his hopes and wishes, in short he is a dramatic maniac.</P>

<P>Oh, yes, he fancies himself a great favourite with the women.</P>

<P>Then I've an idea, I've got a thought by which you may revenge yourself on Lady Waitfort—in fact—give him the letter—he'll certainly believe 'tis meant for himself.</P>

<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, a thousand thanks, we'll flatter his vanity by persuading him she's young and beautiful, and my life on't it does wonders—but hush, here he comes.</P>

<P>Now that's the very thing—hark'ye, I've found out a secret—what every body understands, nobody ap∣proves, and people always applaud most where they least comprehend—there is a refinement fir, in appearing to understand things incomprehensible—else whence arises the pleasure at an Opera, a private Play, or a Speech in Parliament?

<P>Well, but I release you from your fears, I'll tell you why I have given you this trouble—my bu∣siness, Mr Vapid, was to converse with you on the farci∣cal affair that happen'd at Neville's.</P>

<P>No, sir, far from it—I have no doubt but it is a very elegant composition.</P>

<P>But to be serious, Mr Vapid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VAP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I <HI>am</HI> serious—and I'll tell you Lady Wait∣fort —'Tis the last line of an Epilogue, and the last scene of a comedy that always distracts me—'tis the reconcilia∣tion of lovers—there's the difficulty!—you find it so in real life I dare say?</P>

<P>Sir, do you mean to insult me?</P>

<P>My dear Harry, let this be my apology for not having seen you before <STAGE><HI>(Gives a deed.)</HI></STAGE> Miss Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney, ten thousand joys; and could I have found my brother, you should have seen him sooner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, here is a deed of gift for half your estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, but say nothing; when you gav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me money, five years ago, did I say any thing? No, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orgot it as soon as it was over, and should never have reccol∣lected it at this moment, but for my lord's inhumanity. Uncle, I thank you, you have made me the happiest man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't perplex me, what a compound of folly and generosity.</P>

<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Uncle-in-law, what are your feelings on this oc∣casion, as my aunt says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Feelings! I never knew a Peer have any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but now I find the contrary; I be∣gin to think I've a heart like other men—it's better to a∣tone for an error than persist in one, therefore give me that deed, Neville. There sir, <STAGE>(<HI>giving it back to</HI> Flori∣velle)</STAGE> do you think nobody has estates to give away but yourself—Louisa and her fortune are your's Mr Neville, and after my death you shall have mine—and now there's a curst burden off my mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you're a dear creature! and I won't mar∣ry—that's what I won't without consulting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You marry! why shou'd you marry, and how came you here pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman run away with me, he is now in the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the room! What Florivelle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No behind you</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to</HI> Vapid <HI>who is writing at the table.</HI>)</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ghost's and spectres! my evil genius!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come my dear, haven't you almost finished?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VAP. <HI>(Rising)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the denouement is compleat, and now my dear I resign myself to love and you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my good lord, pray give consent, my husband will get money tho' I have none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>None—I dare say he can tell you he will have twelve thousand pounds in less than a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I? Then faith Mr Vapid, we'll build a theatre of our own—you shall write plays and I'll act them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ENNUI.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've an idea I give you joy Mr Neville—I mean to kill time by living single and therefore I hope the lady and the borough may be yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr Ennui, I hope you'll pardon me and sir Harry Hustle the fatigue we occasioned you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mention it—yaw, yaw,—the very recol∣lection makes me faint—in fact my lord, I just met one of Lady Waitfort's servants who tells me she has left Bath in a rage.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid she has escaped too easily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, damn her! never think of her—I can answer for her punishment being adequate to her crimes—Willoughby has told me all her schemes, and if ever I hear her name again; may I lose my peerage and be forced to dress like a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord! I've an idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VAP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir I beg your pardon; but really if you have an idea, I'll be much obliged to you if you'll spare it me for my comedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In fact, I don't comprehend, I have read your <HI>die-all</HI> Epilogue, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VAP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh then sir, I don't wonder at your having ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall expect satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VAP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Satisfaction! sir, if any one insults me I'll lick 'em on the stage sir, that's my way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. SCRATCH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, never mind him, the poor fellow is always talking of what he never had—Ideas in∣deed!—but come my boy Neville, may you be as happy as I am—I'm the happiest Peer alive, and I—when I die—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FLOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I'll answer for his happiness by my own—Miss Courtney, notwithstanding my brother, I will still live in your eye, die in your lap—and be buried in your heart, and moreover I will stay with you both in England, and never return to Italy again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Florivelle.</P>
<LG>
<L>"And thus behold what ev'ry hour shall prove</L>
<L>"That real happiness is—mutual love.</L>
