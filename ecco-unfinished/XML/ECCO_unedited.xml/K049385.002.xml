<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 1, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was in deference to your opinion, re∣inforced
by my own inclination, and the
repeated advice of other friends, that I
resolved upon my late excursion to Italy. I
could plainly perceive from the anxious solli∣citude,
and pressing exhortations contained in
all the letters I had lately received from my
correspondents in Britain, that you had all
despaired of my recovery. You advised me
to make a pilgrimage among the Alps, and
the advice was good. In scrambling among
those mountains, I should have benefited by
the exercise, and at the same time have
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
breathed a cool, pure, salubrious air, which,
in all probability, would have expelled the
slow fever arising in a great measure from the
heat of this climate. But, I wanted a com∣panion
and fellow-traveller, whose conversa∣tion
and society could alleviate the horrors of
solitude. Besides, I was not strong enough
to encounter the want of conveniencies, and
even of necessaries to which I must have been
exposed in the course of such an expedition.
My worthy friend Dr. A—earnestly in∣treated
me to try the effect of a sea-voyage,
which you know has been found of wonder∣ful
effecacy in consumptive cases. After some
deliberation, I resolved upon the scheme, which
I have now happily executed. I had a most
eager curiosity to see the antiquities of Flo∣rence
and Rome: I longed impatiently to
view those wonderful edifices, statues, and pic∣tures,
which I had so often admired in prints
and descriptions. I felt an enthusiastic ardor
to tread that very classical ground which had
been the scene of so many great atchieve∣ments;
and I could not bear the thought of
returning to England from the very skirts of
Italy, without having penetrated to the capi∣tal
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
of that renowned country. With regard
to my health, I knew I could manage mat∣ters
so as to enjoy all the benefits that could
be expected from the united energy of a
voyage by sea, a journey by land, and a
change of climate.</P>
<P>Rome is betwixt four and five hundred
miles distant from Nice, and one half of the
way I was resolved to travel by water. In∣deed
there is no other way of going from hence
to Genoa, unless you take a mule, and clam∣ber
along the mountains at the rate of two
miles an hour, and at the risque of breaking
your neck every minute. The Appenine
mountains, which are no other than a con∣tinuation
of the maritime Alps, form an al∣most
continued precipice from Villefranche
to Lerici, which is almost forty-five miles on
the other side of Genoa; and as they are
generally washed by the sea, there is no beach
or shore, consequently the road is carried a∣long
the face of the rocks, except at certain
small intervals, which are occupied by towns
and villages. But, as there is a road for
mules and foot passengers, it might certainly
be enlarged and improved so as to render it
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
practicable by chaises and other wheel-car∣riages,
and a toll might be exacted, which in
a little time would defray the expence: for
certainly no person who travels to Italy, from
England, Holland, France, or Spain, would
make a troublesome circuit to pass the Alps by
the way of Savoy and Piedmont, if he could
have the convenience of going post by the
way of Aix, Antibes, and Nice, along the
side of the Mediterranean, and through the
Riviera of Genoa, which from the sea affords
the most agreeable and amazing prospect I ever
beheld. What pity it is, they cannot restore
the celebrated <HI>Via Aurelia,</HI> mentioned in the
Itinerarium of Antoninus, which extended
from Rome by the way of Genoa, and
through this country as far as Arles upon the
Rhone. It was said to have been made by
the emperor Marcus Aurelius; and some of
the vestiges of it are still to be seen in Pro∣vence.
The truth is, the nobility of Genoa,
who are all merchants, from a low, selfish, and
absurd policy, take all methods to keep their
subjects of the Riviera in poverty and depen∣dence.
With this view, they carefully avoid
all steps towards rendering that country ac∣cessible
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
by land; and at the same time dis∣courage
their trade by sea, lest it should in∣terfere
with the commerce of their capital,
in which they themselves are personally con∣cerned.</P>
<P>Those who either will not or cannot bear
the sea, and are equally averse to riding, may
be carried in a common chair, provided with
a foot-board, on men's shoulders: this is the
way of travelling practised by the ladies of
Nice, in crossing the mountains to Turin;
but it is very tedious and expensive, as the
men must be often relieved.</P>
<P>The most agreeable carriage from hence to
Genoa, is a feluca, or open boat, rowed by
ten or twelve stout mariners. Though none
of these boats belong to Nice, they are to be
found every day in our harbour, waiting for
a fare to Genoa; and they are seen passing
and repassing continually, with merchandize
or passengers, between Marseilles, Antibes,
and the Genoese territories. A feluca is large
enough to take in a post-chaise; and there
is a tilt over the stern-sheets, where the pas∣sengers
sit, to protect them from the rain:
between the seats one person may lie commo∣diously
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
upon a mattrass, which is commonly
supplied by the patron. A man in good
health may put up with any thing; but I
would advise every valetudinarian who travels
this way, to provide his own chaise, mattrass,
and bed-linnen, otherwise he will pass his
time very uncomfortably. If you go as a
simple passenger in a feluca, you pay about a
loui'dore for your place, and you must be in∣tirely
under the direction of the patron, who,
while he can bear the sea, will prosecute his
voyage by night as well as by day, and expose
you to many other inconveniencies: but for
eight zequines, or four loui'dores, you can
have a whole feluca to yourself, from Nice to
Genoa, and the master shall be obliged to put
a shore every evening. If you would have it
still more at you command, you may hire it
at so much per day and in that case, go on
shore as often, and stay as long as you please.
This is the method I should take, were I to
make the voyage again; for I am persuaded
I should find it very near as cheap, and much
more agreeable than any other.</P>
<P>The distance between this place and Genoa,
when measured on the carte, does not exceed
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
ninety miles: but the people of the felucas
insist upon its being one hundred and twenty.
If they creep along shore round the bottoms
of all the bays, this computation may be true:
but, except when the sea is rough, they stretch
directly from one head-land to another, and
even when the wind is contrary, provided the
gale is not fresh, they perform the voyage in
two days and a half, by dint of rowing:
when the wind is favourable, they will sail
it easily in fourteen hours.</P>
<P>A man, who has nothing but expedition in
view, may go with the courier, who has al∣ways
a light boat well manned, and will be
glad to accommodate a traveller for a rea∣sonable
gratification. I know an English
gentleman who always travels with the courier
in Italy, both by sea and land. In posting
by land, he is always sure of having part of
a good calash, and the best horses that can
be found; and as the expence of both is de∣frayed
by the public, it costs him nothing
but a present to his companion, which does
not amount to one fourth part of the expence
he would incur by travelling alone. These
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
opportunities may be had every week in all
the towns of Italy.</P>
<P>For my own part, I hired a gondola from
hence to Genoa. This is a boat smaller than
a feluca, rowed by four men, and steered by
the patron; but the price was nine zequines,
rather more than I should have payed for a
feluca of ten oars. I was assured that being
very light, it would make great way; and
the master was particularly recommended to
me, as an honest man and an able mariner. I
was accompanied in this voyage by my wife
and Miss C—, together with one Mr. R—,
a native of Nice, whom I treated with the
jaunt, in hopes that as he was acquainted
with the customs of the country, and the
different ways of travelling in it, he would
save us much trouble, and some expence:
but I was much disappointed. Some persons
at Nice offered to lay wagers that he would re∣turn
by himself from Italy; but they were also
disappointed.</P>
<P>We embarked in the beginning of Septem∣ber,
attended by one servant. The heats,
which render travelling dangerous in Italy,
begin to abate at this season. The weather
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
was extremely agreeable; and if I had post∣poned
my voyage a little longer, I foresaw
that I should not be able to return before
winter; in which case I might have found
the sea too rough, and the weather too cold
for a voyage of one hundred and thirty-five
miles in an open boat.</P>
<P>Having therefore provided myself with a
proper pass, signed and sealed by our consul,
as well as with letters of recommendation
from him to the English consuls at Genoa
and Leghorn, a precaution which I would
advise all travellers to take, in case of meet∣ing
with accidents on the road, we went on
board about ten in the morning, stopped a∣bout
half an hour at a friend's country-house
in the bay of St. Hospice, and about noon
entered the harbour of Monaco, where the
patron was obliged to pay toll, according to
the regulation which I have explained in a
former letter. This small town, containing
about eight or nine hundred souls, besides the
garrison, is built on a rock which projects
into the sea, and makes a very romantic ap∣pearance.
The prince's palace stands in the
most conspicuous part, with a walk of trees
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
before it. The apartments are elegantly fur∣nished,
and adorned with some good pictures.
The fortifications are in good repair, and the
place is garrisoned by two French battalions.
The present prince of Monaco is a Frenchman,
son of the duke de Matignon, who married
the heiress of Monaco, whose name was
Grimaldi. The harbour is well sheltered
from the wind; but has not water sufficient
to admit vessels of any great burthen. To∣wards
the north, the king of Sardinia's terri∣tories
extend to within a mile of the gate;
but the prince of Monaco can go upon his
own ground along shore about five or six
miles to the eastward, as far as Menton, ano∣ther
small town, which also belongs to him,
and is situated on the sea-side. His revenues
are computed at a million of French livres,
amounting to something more than forty
thousand pounds sterling: but, the princi∣pality
of Monaco, consisting of three small
towns, and an inconsiderable tract of barren
rock, is not worth above seven thousand a
year; the rest arises from his French estate.
This consists partly of the dutchy of Matig∣non,
and partly of the duchy of Valentinois,
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
which last was given to the ancestors of this
prince of Monaco, in the year 1640, by the
French king, to make up the loss of some
lands in the kingdom of Naples, which were
confiscated when he expelled the Spanish garri∣on
from Monaco, and threw himself into the
arms of France: so that he is duke of Valen∣tinois
as well as of Matignon, in that king∣dom.
He lives almost constantly in France;
and has taken the name and arms of Gri∣maldi.</P>
<P>The Genoese territories begin at Ventimig∣lia,
another town lying on the coast, at the
distance of twenty miles from Nice, a cir∣cumstance
from which it borrows the name.
Having passed the towns of Monaco, Menton,
Ventimiglia, and several other places of less
consequence that lie along this coast, we turn∣ed
the point of St. Martin with a favourable
breeze, and might have proceeded twenty miles
further before night: but the women began
to be sick, as well as afraid at the roughness
of the water; Mr. R—was so discom∣posed,
that he privately desired the patron to
put ashore at St. Remo, on pretence that we
should not find a tolerable auberge in any
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
other place between this and Noli, which was
at the distance of forty miles. We accord∣ingly
landed, and were conducted to the poste,
which our gondeliere assured us was the best
auberge in the whole Riviera of Genoa. We
ascended by a dark, narrow, steep stair, into
a kind of public room, with a long table
and benches, so dirty and miserable, that
it would disgrace the worst hedge ale-house
in England. Not a soul appeared to receive
us. This is a ceremony one must not expect
to meet with in France; far less in Italy.
Our patron going into the kitchen, asked a
servant if the company could have lodging
in the house; and was answered, “he could
not tell: the patron was not at home.” When
he desired to know where the patron was, the
other answered, “he was gone to take the
air.” <HI>E andato a passeggiare.</HI> In the mean
time, we were obliged to sit in the common
room among watermen and muleteers. At
length the landlord arrived, and gave us to
understand, that he could accommodate us
with chambers. In that where I lay, there
was just room for two beds, without curtains
or bedstead, an old rotten table covered with
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
dried figs, and a couple of crazy chairs.
The walls had been once white-washed: but
were now hung with cobwebs, and speckled
with dirt of all forts; and I believe the brick∣floor
had not been swept for half a century.
We supped in an outward room suitable in
all respects to the chamber, and fared vil∣lainously.
The provision was very ill-dressed,
and served up in the most slovenly manner.
You must not expect cleanliness or conve∣niency
of any kind in this country. For
this accommodation I payed as much as if I
had been elegantly entertained in the best au∣berge
of France or Italy.</P>
<P>Next day, the wind was so high that we
could not prosecute our voyage, so that we
were obliged to pass other four and twenty
hours in this comfortable situation. Luck∣ily
Mr. R—found two acquaintances in
the place; one a Franciscan monk, a jolly
fellow; and the other a <HI>maestro di capella,</HI>
who sent a spinnet to the inn, and enter∣tained
us agreeably with his voice and per∣formance,
in both of which accomplishments
he excelled. The padre was very good hu∣moured,
and favoured us with a letter of re∣commendation
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
to a friend of his, a professor
in the university of Pisa. You would laugh
to see the hyperbolical terms in which he
mentioned your humble servant: but Italy is
the native country of hyperbole.</P>
<P>St. Remo is a pretty considerable town,
well-built upon the declivity of a gently rising
hill, and has a harbour capable of receiving
small vessels, a good number of which are
built upon the beach: but ships of any
burden are obliged to anchor in the bay,
which is far from being secure. The people
of St. Remo form a small republic, which is
subject to Genoa. They enjoyed particular
privileges, till the year 1753, when in conse∣quence
of a new gabelle upon salt, they re∣volted:
but this effort in behalf of liberty
did not succeed. They were soon reduced
by the Genoese, who deprived them of all their
privileges, and built a fort by the sea-side,
which serves the double purpose of defend∣ing
the harbour and over-awing the town.
The garrison at present does not exceed two
hundred men. The inhabitants are said to
have lately sent a deputation to Ratisbon, to
crave the protection of the diet of the empire.
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
There is very little plain ground in this
neighbourhood; but the hills are covered
with oranges, lemons, pomegranates, and
olives, which produce a considerable traffic
in fine fruit and excellent oil. The women
of St. Remo are much more handsome and
better tempered than those of Provence. They
have in general good eyes, with open inge∣nuous
countenances. Their dress, though
remarkable, I cannot describe; but upon the
whole, they put me in mind of some por∣traits
I have seen, representing the females of
Georgia and Mingrelia.</P>
<P>On the third day, the wind being abated,
though still unfavourable, we reimbarked and
rowed along shore, passing by Porto-mauricio,
and Oneglia; then turning the promontory
called Capo di Melle, we proceeded by Al∣benga,
Finale, and many other places of in∣ferior
note. Porto-mauricio is seated on a rock
washed by the sea, but indifferently fortified,
with an inconsiderable harbour, which none
but very small vessels can enter. About two
miles to the eastward is Oneglia, a small
town with some fortifications, lying along the
open beach, and belonging to the king of
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
Sardinia. This small territory abounds with
olive-trees, which produce a considerable quan∣tity
of oil, counted the best of the whole Ri∣viera.
Albenga is a small town, the see of a
bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Genoa.
It lies upon the sea, and the country produces
a great quantity of hemp. Finale is the
capital of a marquisate belonging to the
Genoese, which has been the source of much
trouble to the republic; and indeed was the
sole cause of their rupture with the king of
Sardinia and the house of Austria in the year
1745. The town is pretty well built; but the
harbour is shallow, open, and unsafe: never∣theless,
they build a good number of tartans
and other vessels on the beach; and the
neighbouring country abounds with oil and
fruit, particularly with those excellent apples
called <HI>pomi carli,</HI> which I have mentioned in
a former letter.</P>
<P>In the evening we reached the Capo di
Noli, counted very dangerous in blowing
weather. It is a very high perpendicular
rock or mountain washed by the sea, which
has eaten into it in divers places, so as to
form a great number of caverns. It extends
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
about a couple of miles, and in some parts
is indented into little creeks or bays, where
there is a narrow margin of sandy beach be∣tween
it and the water. When the wind is
high, no feluca will attempt to pass it; even
in a moderate breeze, the waves dashing
against the rocks and caverns, which echo
with the sound, make such an awful noise,
and at the same time occasion such a rough
sea, as one cannot hear, and see, and feel,
without a secret horror.</P>
<P>On this side of the Cape, there is a beau∣tiful
strand cultivated like a garden; the plan∣tations
extend to the very tops of the hills,
interspersed with villages, castles, churches,
and villas. Indeed the whole Riviera is orna∣mented
in the same manner, except in such
places as admit of no building nor cultiva∣tion.</P>
<P>Having passed the Cape, we followed the
winding of the coast, into a small bay, and
arrived at the town of Noli, where we pro∣posed
to pass the night. You will be sur∣prized
that we did not go ashore sooner, in
order to take some refreshment; but the
truth is, we had a provision of ham, tongues,
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
roasted pullets, cheese, bread, wine, and fruit,
in the feluca, where we every day enjoyed
a slight repast about one or two o'clock in the
afternoon. This I mention as a necessary piece
of information to those who may be inclined
to follow the same route. We likewise found
it convenient to lay in store of <HI>l'eau de vie,</HI> or
brandy, for the use of the rowers, who always
expect to share your comforts. On a meagre
day, however, those ragamuffins will rather
die of hunger than suffer the least morsel of
flesh-meat to enter their mouths. I have
frequently tried the experiment, by pressing
them to eat something <HI>gras,</HI> on a Friday or
Saturday: but they always declined it with
marks of abhorrence, crying, <HI>Dio me ne libere!</HI>
God deliver me from it! or some other words
to that effect. I moreover observed, that not
one of those fellows ever swore an oath, or
spoke an indecent word. They would by no
means put to sea, of a morning, before they
had heard mass; and when the wind was un∣favourable,
they always set out with a hymn
to the Blessed Virgin, or St. Elmo, keeping
time with their oars as they sung. I have in∣deed
remarked all over this country, that a
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
man who transgresses the institutions of the
church in these small matters, is much more
infamous than one who has committed the
most flagrant crimes against nature and mora∣lity.
A murderer, adulterer, or s—m—te,
will obtain easy absolution from the church,
and even find favour with society; but a man
who eats a pidgeon on a Saturday, without
express licence, is avoided and abhorred, as a
monster of reprobation. I have conversed
with several intelligent persons on the subject;
and have reason to believe, that a delinquent of
this sort is considered as a luke-warm catho∣lic,
little better than a heretic; and of all
crimes they look upon heresy as the most
damnable.</P>
<P>Noli is a small republic of fishermen sub∣ject
to Genoa; but very tenacious of their
privileges. The town stands on the beach,
tolerably well built, defended by a castle si∣tuated
on a rock above it; and the harbour
is of little consequence. The auberge was
such as made us regret even the inn we had
left at St. Remo. After a very odd kind of
supper, which I cannot pretend to describe,
we retired to our repose: but I had not been
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
in bed five minutes, when I felt something
crawling on different parts of my body, and
taking a light to examine, perceived above a
dozen large bugs. You must know I have
the same kind of antipathy to these vermin,
that some persons have to a cat or breast of
veal. I started up immediately, and wrap∣ping
myself in a great coat, sick as I was,
laid down in the outer room upon a chest,
where I continued till morning.</P>
<P>One would imagine that in a mountainous
country like this, there should be plenty of
goats; and indeed, we saw many flocks of
them feeding among the rocks, yet we could
not procure half a pint of milk for our tea,
if we had given the weight of it in gold.
The people here have no idea of using milk,
and when you ask them for it, they stand
gaping with a foolish face of surprize, which
is exceedingly provoking. It is amazing that
instinct does not teach the peasants to feed
their children with goat's milk, so much more
nourishing and agreeable than the wretched
sustenance on which they live. Next day we
rowed by Vado and Savona, which last is a
large town, with a strong citadel, and a har∣bour,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
which was formerly capable of receiv∣ing
large ships: but it fell a sacrifice to the
jealousy of the Genoese, who have partly
choaked it up, on pretence that it should not
afford shelter to the ships of war belonging
to those states which might be at enmity with
the republic.</P>
<P>Then we passed Albisola, Sestri di Ponente,
Novi, Voltri, and a great number of vil∣lages,
villas, and magnificent palaces belong∣ing
to the Genoese nobility, which form al∣most
a continued chain of buildings along the
strand for thirty miles.</P>
<P>About five in the afternoon, we skirted the
fine suburbs of St. Petro D'arena, and arrived
at Genoa, which makes a dazzling appear∣ance
when viewed from the sea, rising like
an amphitheatre in a circular form, from the
water's edge, a considerable way up the moun∣tains,
and surrounded on the land side by a
double wall, the most exterior of which is said
to extend fifteen miles in circuit. The first
object that strikes your eye at a distance, is a
very elegant pharos, or light-house, built on
the projection of a rock on the west side of
the harbour, so very high, that, in a clear
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
day, you may see it at the distance of thirty
miles. Turning the light-house point, you
find yourself close to the mole, which forms the
harbour of Genoa. It is built at a great ex∣pence
from each side of the bay, so as to form
in the sea two long magnificent jettes, which
if continued, would meet. At the extremity
of each is another smaller lanthorn. These
moles are both provided with brass-cannon,
and between them is the entrance into the
harbour. But this is still so wide as to admit
a great sea, which, when the wind blows hard
from south and south west, is very trouble∣some
to the shipping. Within the mole there
is a smaller harbour or wet dock, called <HI>Dar∣sena,</HI>
for the gallies of the republic. We
passed through a considerable number of
ships and vessels lying at anchor, and landing
at the water-gate, repaired to an inn called
<HI>La Croix de Malthe,</HI> in the neighbourhood
of the harbour. Here we met with such
good entertainment as prepossessed us in fa∣vour
of the interior parts of Italy, and con∣tributed
with other motives to detain us some
days in this city. But, I have detained you
so long, that I believe you wish I may pro∣ceed
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
no farther; and therefore I take my

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without reason that Genoa is
called <HI>La superba.</HI> The city itself is very
stately; and the nobles are very proud. Some
few of them may be proud of their wealth:
but, in general, their fortunes are very small.
My friend Mr. R—assured me that many
Genoese noblemen had fortunes of half a
million of livres <HI>per annum:</HI> but the truth is,
the whole revenue of the state does not ex∣ceed
this sum; and the livre of Genoa is but
about nine pence sterling. There are about
half a dozen of their nobles who have ten
thousand a year: but the majority have not
above a twentieth part of that sum. They
live with great parsimony in their families;
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
and wear nothing but black in public; so
that their expences are but small. If a
Genoese nobleman gives an entertainment
once a quarter, he is said to live upon the
fragments all the rest of the year. I was
told that one of them lately treated his friends,
and left the entertainment to the care of his
son, who ordered a dish of fish that cost a
zechine, which is equal to about ten shil∣lings
sterling. The old gentleman no sooner
saw it appear on the table, than unable to
suppress his concern, he burst into tears, and
exclaimed, <HI>Ab Figliuolo indegno! Siamo in
Rovina! Siamo in precipizio!</HI></P>
<P>I think the pride or ostentation of the
Italians in general takes a more laudable turn
than that of other nations. A Frenchman lays
out his whole revenue upon tawdry suits of
cloaths, or in furnishing a magnificent <HI>repas</HI>
of fifty or a hundred dishes, one half of
which are not eatable, nor intended to be
eaten. His wardrobe goes to the <HI>fripier;</HI>
his dishes to the dogs, and himself to the
devil, and after his decease no vestige of him
remains. A Genoese, on the other hand,
keeps himself and his family at short allow∣ance,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
that he may save money to build palaces
and churches, which remain to after-ages so
many monuments of his taste, piety, and
munificence; and in the mean time give em∣ployment
and bread to the poor and in∣dustrious.
There are some Genoese nobles
who have each five or six elegant palaces mag∣nificently
furnished, either in the city, or in
different parts of the Riviera. The two
streets called <HI>Strada Balbi</HI> and <HI>Strada Nuova,</HI>
are continued double ranges of palaces a∣dorned
with gardens and fountains: but
their being painted on the outside has, in
my opinion, a poor effect.</P>
<P>The commerce of this city is, at present,
not very considerable; yet it has the face of
business. The streets are crouded with peo∣ple;
the shops are well furnished; and the
markets abound with all sorts of excellent
provision. The wine made in this neigh∣bourhood
is, however, very indifferent; and
all that is consumed must be bought at the
public cantinre, where it is sold for the bene∣fit
of the state. Their bread is the whitest
and the best I have tasted any where; and
the beef, which they have from Piedmont, is
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
juicy and delicious. The expence of eating
in Italy is nearly the same as in France,
about three shillings a head for every meal.
The state of Genoa is very poor, and their
bank of St. George has received such rude
shocks, first from the revolt of the Corsicans,
and afterwards from the misfortunes of the
city, when it was taken by the Austrians in
the war of 1745, that it still continues to
languish without any near prospect of its
credit being restored. Nothing shews the
weakness of their state, more than their
having recourse to the assistance of France to
put a stop to the progress of Paoli in Corsica;
for after all that has been said of the gal∣lantry
and courage of Paoli and his islanders,
I am very credibly informed that they might
be very easily suppressed, if the Genoese had
either vigour in the council or resolution in
the field.</P>
<P>True it is, they made a noble effort in ex∣pelling
the Austrians who had taken possession
of their city; but this effort was the effect of
oppression and despair, and if I may believe
the insinuations of some politicians in this
part of the world, the Genoese would not
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
have succeeded in that attempt, if they had
not previously purchased with a large sum of
money the connivance of the only person who
could defeat the enterprize. For my own
part, I can scarce entertain thoughts so pre∣judicial
to the character of human nature, as
to suppose a man capable of sacrificing to
such a consideration, the duty he owed his
prince, as well as all regard to the lives of
his soldiers, even those who lay sick in hos∣pitals,
and who being dragged forth, were
miserably butchered by the furious populace.
There is one more presumption of his inno∣cence,
he still retains the favour of his sove∣reign,
who could not well be supposed to
share in the booty. “There are mysteries in
politics which were never dreamed of in our
philosophy, Horatio!” The possession of Ge∣noa
might have proved a troublesome bone
of contention, which it might be convenient
to lose by accident. Certain it is, when the
Austrians returned after their expulsion, in
order to retake the city, the engineer, being
questioned by the general, declared he would
take the place in fifteen days, on pain of
losing his head; and in four days after this
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
declaration the Austrians retired. This anec∣dote
I learned from a worthy gentleman of
this country, who had it from the engineer's
own mouth. Perhaps it was the will of
heaven. You see how favourably providence
has interposed in behalf of the reigning em∣press
of Russia, first in removing her husband;
secondly in ordaining the assassination of
prince Ivan, for which the perpetrators have
been so liberally rewarded; it even seems
determined to shorten the life of her own
son, the only surviving rival from whom she
had any thing to fear.</P>
<P>The Genoese have now thrown themselves
into the arms of France for protection: I
know not whether it would not have been a
greater mark of sagacity to cultivate the
friendship of England, with which they carry
on an advantageous commerce. While the
English are masters of the Mediterranean,
they will always have it in their power to do
incredible damage all along the Riviera, to
ruin the Genoese trade by sea, and even to
annoy the capital; for notwithstanding all
the pains they have taken to fortify the mole
and the city, I am greatly deceived if it is not
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
still exposed to the danger, not only of a
bombardment, but even of a cannonade. I am
even sanguine enough to think a resolute
commander might, with a strong squadron,
fail directly into the harbour, without sus∣taining
much damage, notwithstanding all
the cannon of the place, which are said to
amount to near five hundred. I have seen a
cannonade of above four hundred pieces of
artillery, besides bombs and cohorns, main∣tained
for many hours, without doing much
mischief.</P>
<P>During the last siege of Genoa, the French
auxiliaries were obliged to wait at Monaco,
until a gale of wind had driven the English
squadron off the coast, and then they went
along shore in small vessels at the imminent
risque of being taken by the British cruisers.
By land I apprehend their march would be
altogether impracticable, if the king of Sar∣dinia
had any interest to oppose it. He
might either guard the passes, or break up
the road in twenty different places, so as to
render it altogether impassable. Here it may
not be amiss to observe, that when Don Philip
advanced from Nice with his army to Genoa,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
he was obliged to march so close to the shore,
that in above fifty different places, the English
ships might have rendered the road altogether
impassable. The path, which runs generally
along the face of a precipice washed by the
sea, is so narrow that two men on horseback
can hardly pass each other; and the road it∣self
so rugged, slippery, and dangerous, that
the troopers were obliged to dismount, and
lead their horses one by one. On the other
hand, baron de Leutrum, who was at the
head of a large body of Piedmontese troops,
had it in his power to block up the passes of
the mountains, and even to destroy this road
in such a manner, that the enemy could not
possibly advance. Why these precautions
were not taken, I do not pretend to explain:
neither can I tell you wherefore the prince of
Monaco, who is a subject and partizan of
France, was indulged with a neutrality for
his town, which served as a refreshing-place,
a safe port, and an intermediate post for the
French succours sent from Marseilles to Ge∣noa.
This I will only venture to affirm, that
the success and advantage of great alliances
are often sacrificed to low, partial, selfish, and
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
sordid considerations. The town of Monaco
is commanded by every heighth in its neigh∣bourhood;
and might be laid in ashes by a
bomb-ketch in four hours by sea.</P>
<P>I was fortunate enough to be recommended
to a lady in Genoa, who treated us with great
politeness and hospitality. She introduced
me to an <HI>abbate,</HI> a man of letters, whose
conversation was extremely agreeable. He
already knew me by reputation, and offered
to make me known to some of the first per∣sons
in the republic, with whom he lived in
intimacy. The lady is one of the most in∣telligent
and best-bred persons I have known
in any country. We assisted at her conver∣sazione,
which was numerous. She pressed us
to pass the winter at Genoa; and indeed I
was almost persuaded: but I had attach∣ments
at Nice, from which I could not ea∣sily
disengage myself.</P>
<P>The few days we stayed at Genoa were
employed in visiting the most remarkable
churches and palaces. In some of the
churches, particularly that of the <HI>Annunciata,</HI>
I found a profusion of ornaments, which had
more magnificence than taste. There is a
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
great number of pictures; but very few of
them are capital pieces. I had heard much
of the <HI>ponte Carignano,</HI> which did not at all
answer my expectation. It is a bridge that
unites two eminences which form the higher
part of the city, and the houses in the bottom
below do not rise so high as the springing of
its arches. There is nothing at all curious
in its construction, nor any way remarkable,
except the heighth of the piers from which
the arches are sprung. Hard by the bridge
there is an elegant church, from the top of
which you have a very rich and extensive
prospect of the city, the sea and the adjacent
country, which looks like a continent of
groves and villas. The only remarkable cir∣cumstance
about the cathedral, which is Go∣thic
and gloomy, is the chapel where the
pretended bones of John the Baptist are de∣posited,
and in which thirty silver lamps are
continually burning. I had a curiosity to see
the palaces of Durazzo and Doria, but it re∣quired
more trouble to procure admission than
I was willing to give myself: as for the arse∣nal,
and the rostrum of an ancient galley
which was found by accident in dragging
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
the harbour, I postponed seeing them till my
return.</P>
<P>Having here provided myself with letters
of credit for Florence and Rome, I hired the
same boat which had brought us hither, to
carry us forward to Lerici, which is a small
town about half way between Genoa and Leg∣horn,
where travellers, who are tired of the
sea, take post-chaises to continue their route
by land to Pisa and Florence. I payed three
loui'dores for this voyage of about fifty
miles; though I might have had a feluca
for less money. When you land on the
wharf at Genoa, you are plied by the feluca
men just as you are plied by the watermen at
Hungerford-stairs in London. They are al∣ways
ready to set off at a minute's warning
for Lerici, Leghorn, Nice, Antibes, Mar∣seilles,
and every part of the Riviera.</P>
<P>The wind being still unfavourable, though
the weather was delightful, we rowed along
shore, passing by several pretty towns, vil∣lages,
and a vast number of <HI>cassines,</HI> or little
white houses, scattered among woods of olive
trees, that cover the hills; and these are the
habitations of the velvet and damask weavers.
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Turning Capo Fino we entered a bay, where
stand the towns of Porto Fino, Lavagna, and
Sestri di Levante, at which last we took up
our night's lodging. The house was tolera∣ble,
and we had no great reason to complain
of the beds: but, the weather being hot,
there was a very offensive smell, which pro∣ceeded
from some skins of beasts new killed,
that were spread to dry on an out-house in
the yard. Our landlord was a butcher, and
had very much the looks of an assassin. His
wife was a great masculine virago, who had
all the air of having frequented the slaughter-house.
Instead of being welcomed with looks
of complaisance, we were admitted with a sort
of gloomy condescension, which seemed to say,
“We don't much like your company; but,
however, you shall have a night's lodging in
favour of the <HI>patron of the gondola,</HI> who is
our acquaintance.” In short, we had a very
bad supper, miserably dressed, passed a very
disagreeable night, and payed a very extrava∣gant
bill in the morning, without being
thanked for our custom. I was very glad to get
out of the house with my throat uncut.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Sestri di Levante is a little town pleasantly
situated on the sea-side; but has not the conve∣niency
of a harbour. The fish taken here is most∣ly
carried to Genoa. This is likewise the mar∣ket
for their oil, and the paste called <HI>macaroni,</HI>
of which they make a good quantity.</P>
<P>Next day, we skirted a very barren coast,
consisting of almost perpendicular rocks, on
the faces of which, however, we saw many
peasants houses and hanging terraces for
vines, made by dint of incredible labour. In
the afternoon, we entered by the Porto di
Venere into the bay, or gulf of Spetia or
Spezza, which was the Portus Lunae of the
ancients. This bay, at the mouth of which
lies the island Palmaria, forms a most noble
and secure harbour, capacious enough to
contain all the navies in Christendom. The
entrance on one side is defended by a small
fort built above the town of Porto Venere,
which is a very poor place. Farther in there
is a battery of about twenty guns; and on
the right hand, opposite to Porto Venere, is a
block-house, founded on a rock in the sea.
At the bottom of the bay is the town of
Spetia on the left, and on the right that of
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Lerici, defended by a castle of very little
strength or consequence. The whole bay is
surrounded with plantations of olives and
oranges, and makes a very delightful appear∣ance.
In case of a war, this would be an admi∣rable
station for a British squadron, as it lies so
near Genoa and Leghorn; and has a double
entrance, by means of which the cruisers could
sail in and out continually, which way soever
the wind might chance to sit. I am sure the
fortifications would give very little disturbance.</P>
<P>At the post-house in Lerici, the accom∣modation
is intolerable. We were almost
poisoned at supper. I found the place where
I was to lie so close and confined, that I could
not breathe in it, and therefore lay all night
in an outward room upon four chairs, with
a leather portmanteau for my pillow. For
this entertainment I payed very near a loui'dore.
Such bad accommodation is the less excusable,
as the fellow has a great deal of business, this
being a great thoroughfare for travellers going
into Italy, or returning from thence.</P>
<P>I might have saved some money by pro∣secuting
my voyage directly by sea to Leg∣horn:
but, by this time, we were all heartily
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
tired of the water: the business then was to
travel by land to Florence, by the way of Pisa,
which is seven posts distant from Lerici. Those
who have not their own carriage must either
hire chaises to perform the whole journey, or
travel by way of <HI>cambiatura,</HI> which is that of
changing the chaises every post, as the custom
is in England. In this case the great incon∣venience
arises from your being obliged to
shift your baggage every post. The chaise or
<HI>calesse</HI> of this country, is a wretched machine
with two wheels, as uneasy as a common cart,
being indeed no other than what we should
call in England a very ill-contrived one-horse
chair, narrow, naked, shattered and shabby.
For this vehicle and two horses you pay at
the rate of eight <HI>paoli</HI> a stage, or four shillings
sterling; and the postilion expects two <HI>paoli</HI> for
his gratification: so that every eight miles
cost about five shillings, and four only, if you
travel in your own carriage, as in that case
you pay no more than at the rate of three
<HI>paoli</HI> a horse.</P>
<P>About three miles from Lerici, we crossed
the Magra, which appeared as a rivulet almost
dry, and in half a mile farther arrived at Sar∣zana,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
a small town at the extremity of the
Genoese territories, where we changed horses.
Then entering the principalities of Massa and
Carrara, belonging to the duke of Modena,
we passed Lavenza, which seems to be a de∣cayed
town with a small garrison, and dined
at Massa, which is an agreeable little town,
where the old dutchess of Modena resides.
Notwithstanding all the expedition we could
make, it was dark before we passed the Cerchio,
which is an inconsiderable stream in the neigh∣bourhood
of Pisa, where we arrived about
eight in the evening.</P>
<P>The country from Sarzana to the frontiers
of Tuscany is a narrow plain, bounded on the
right by the sea, and on the left by the Ap∣penine
mountains. It is well cultivated and
inclosed, consisting of meadow-ground, corn
fields, plantations of olives; and the trees
that form the hedge-rows serve as so many
props to the vines, which are twisted round
them, and continued from one to another.
After entering the dominions of Tuscany, we
travelled through a noble forest of oak trees
of a considerable extent, which would have
appeared much more agreeable, had we not
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
been benighted and apprehensive of rob∣bers.
The last post but one in this day's
journey, is at the little town of Spirito
Santo, a kind of sea-port on the Mediter∣nean.
The roads are indifferent, and the
accommodation is execrable. I was glad to
find myself housed in a very good inn at
Pisa, where I promised myself a good night's
rest, and was not disappointed. I heartily
wish you the same pleasure, and am very
sincerely</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 28, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PISA is a fine old city that strikes you
with the same veneration you would feel
at sight of an antient temple which bears the
marks of decay, without being absolutely de∣lapidated.
The houses are well built, the
streets open, straight, and well paved; the
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
shops well furnished; and the markets well
supplied: there are some elegant palaces,
particularly that of the grand-duke, with a
marble statue of Ferdinand III. before it.
The churches are built with taste, and to∣lerably
ornamented. There is a beautiful
wharf of free-stone on each side of the river
Arno, which runs through the city, and three
bridges thrown over it, of which that in the
middle is of marble, a pretty piece of archi∣tecture:
but the number of inhabitants is
very inconsiderable; and this very circum∣stance
gives it an air of majestic solitude,
which is far from being unpleasant to a man
of a contemplative turn of mind. For my
part, I cannot bear the tumult of a populous
commercial city; and the solitude that reigns
in Pisa would be a strong motive to choose
it as a place of residence. Not that this
would be the only inducement for living at
Pisa. Here is some good company, and even
a few men of taste and learning. The peo∣ple
in general are counted sociable and po∣lite;
and there is great plenty of provisions,
at a very reasonable rate. At some distance
from the more frequented parts of the city,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
a man may hire a large house for thirty
crowns a year: but near the center, you
cannot have good lodgings, ready furnished,
for less than a <HI>scudo</HI> (about five shillings) a
day. The air in summer is reckoned un∣wholesome
by the exhalations arising from
stagnant water in the neighbourhood of the
city, which stands in the midst of a fertile
plain, low and marshy: yet these marshes
have been considerably drained by the new
canal extending from hence to Leghorn.
As for the Arno, it is no longer navigable
for vessels of any burthen. The university
of Pisa is very much decayed; and except
the little business occasioned by the emperor's
gallies, which are built in this town, I know
of no commerce it carries on: perhaps the
inhabitants live on the produce of the coun∣try,
which consists of corn, wine, and cattle.
They are supplied with excellent water for
drinking, by an aqueduct consisting of above
five thousand arches, begun by Cosmo, and
finished by Ferdinand I. grand-dukes of
Tuscany; it conveys the water from the
mountains at the distance of five miles.
This noble city, formerly the capital of a
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
flourishing and powerful republic, which
contained above one hundred and fifty thou∣sand
inhabitants, within its walls, is now so
desolate that grass grows in the open streets;
and the number of its people do not exceed
sixteen thousand.</P>
<P>You need not doubt but I visited the Cam∣panile,
or hanging-tower, which is a beau∣tiful
cylinder of eight stories, each adorned
with a round of columns, rising one above
another. It stands by the cathedral, and in∣clines
so far on one side from the perpendi∣cular,
that in dropping a plummet from the
top, which is one hundred and eighty-eight
feet high, it falls sixteen feet from the base.
For my part, I should never have dreamed
that this inclination proceeded from any other
cause, than an accidental subsidence of the
foundation on this side, if some connoisseurs
had not taken great pains to prove it was
done on purpose by the architect. Any per∣son
who has eyes may see that the pillars
on that side are considerably sunk; and this
is the case with the very threshold of the
door by which you enter. I think it would
have been a very preposterous ambition in
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
the architects, to shew how far they could
deviate from the perpendicular in this con∣struction;
because in that particular any
common mason could have rivalled them;
and if they really intended it as a specimen
of their art, they should have shortened the
pilasters on that side, so as to exhibit them
intire, without the appearance of sinking.
These leaning towers are not unfrequent in
Italy; there is one at Bologna, another at
Venice, a third betwixt Venice and Ferrara,
and a fourth at Ravenna; and the inclination
in all of them has been supposed owing to
the foundations giving way on one side
only.</P>
<P>In the cathedral, which is a large Gothic
pile, there is a great number of massy pil∣lars
of porphyry, granite, jasper, and verde
antico, together with some good pictures and
statues: but the greatest curiosity is that of
the brass-gates, designed and executed by
John of Bologna, representing, embossed in
different compartments, the history of the
Old and New Testament. I was so charm∣ed
with this work, that I could have stood
a whole day to examine and admire it.
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
In the Baptisterium, which stands opposite
to this front, there are some beautiful mar∣bles,
particularly the font, and a pulpit,
supported by the statues of different an∣imals.</P>
<P>Between the cathedral and this building,
about one hundred paces on one side, is the
famous burying-ground, called <HI>Campo Santo,</HI>
from its being covered with earth brought
from Jerusalem. It is an oblong square, sur∣rounded
by a very high wall, and always kept
shut. Within-side there is a spacious corri∣dore
round the whole space, which is a noble
walk for a contemplative philosopher. It is
paved chiefly with flat grave-stones: the walls
are painted in fresco by Ghiotto, Giottino,
Stefano, Bennoti, Bufalmaco, and some o∣thers
of his cotemporaries and disciples, who
flourished immediately after the restoration
of painting. The subjects are taken from
the Bible. Though the manner is dry, the
drawing incorrect, the design generally lame,
and the colouring unnatural; yet there is
merit in the expression: and the whole re∣mains
as a curious monument of the efforts
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
made by this noble art immediately after her
revival. Here are some deceptions in perspec∣tive
equally ingenious and pleasing; particu∣larly
the figures of certain animals, which
exhibit exactly the same appearance, from
whatever different points of view they are
seen. One division of the burying-ground
consists, of a particular compost, which in
nine days consumes the dead bodies to the
bones: in all probability, it is no other than
common earth mixed with quick-lime. At
one corner of the corridore, there are the
pictures of three bodies represented in the
three different stages of putrefaction which
they undergo when laid in this composition.
At the end of the three first days, the body
is bloated and swelled, and the features are
enlarged and distorted to such a degree, as fills
the spectator with horror. At the sixth day,
the swelling is subsided, and all the muscular
flesh hangs loosened from the bones: at the
ninth, nothing but the skeleton remains.
There is a small neat chapel at one end of
the <HI>Campo Santo,</HI> with some tombs, on one of
which is a beautiful bust by Buona Roti. At
the other end of the corridore, there is a
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
range of antient Roman stone-coffins, re∣presenting
on the sides and covers some ex∣cellent
pieces in basso-relievo. The hunting
of Meleager has been greatly admired: but
what struck me most, was the figure of a
woman lying dead on a tomb-stone, covered
with a piece of thin drapery, so delicately
cut as to shew all the flexures of the attitude,
and even all the swellings and sinuosities of
the muscles. Instead of stone, it looks like
a sheet of wet linen.</P>
<P>For four zechines I hired a return-coach
and four from Pisa to Florence. This road,
which lies along the Arno, is very good; and
the country is delightful, variegated with hill
and vale, wood and water, meadows and
corn-fields, planted and inclosed like the
counties of Middlesex and Hampshire; with
this difference, however, that all the trees in
this tract were covered with vines, and the
ripe clusters black and white, hung down
from every bough in the most luxuriant and
romantic abundance. The vines in this coun∣try
are not planted in rows, and propped
with sticks, as in France and the county
of Nice, but twine around the hedge-row
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
trees, which they almost quite cover with
their foliage and fruit. The branches of
the vine are extended from tree to tree, ex∣hibiting
beautiful festoons of real leaves,
tendrils, and swelling clusters a foot long.
By this oeconomy the ground of the inclo∣sure
is spared for corn, grass, or any other
production. The trees commonly planted
for the purpose of sustaining the vines, are
maple, elm, and aller, with which last the
banks of the Arno abound. This river,
which is very inconsiderable with respect to
the quantity of water, would be a charming
pastoral stream, if it was transparent; but it
is always muddy and discoloured. About
ten or a dozen miles below Florence, there
are some marble quarries on the side of it,
from whence the blocks are conveyed in
boats, when there is water enough in the
river to float them, that is after heavy rains,
or the melting of the snow upon the moun∣tains
of Umbria, being part of the Appenines,
from whence it takes its rise.</P>
<P>Florence is a noble city, that still retains
all the marks of a majestic capital, such as
piazzas, palaces, fountains, bridges, statues,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
and arcades. I need not tell you that the
churches here are magnificent, and adorned
not only with pillars of oriental granite, por∣phyry,
jasper, verde antico, and other preci∣ous
stones; but also with capital pieces of
painting by the most eminent masters. Seve∣ral
of these churches, however, stand with∣out
fronts, for want of money to complete
the plans. It may also appear superfluous to
mention my having viewed the famous gal∣lery
of antiquities, the chapel of St. Lorenzo,
the palace of Pitti, the cathedral, the bap∣tisterium,
the <HI>Ponte de Trinita,</HI> with its sta∣tues,
the triumphal arch, and every thing
which is commonly visited in this metropolis.
But all these objects having been circumstan∣tially
described by twenty different authors of
travels, I shall not trouble you with a repeti∣tion
of trite observations.</P>
<P>That part of the city which stands on each
side of the river, makes a very elegant ap∣pearance,
to which the four bridges and the
stone-quay between them, contribute in a
great measure. I lodged at the widow
Vanini's, an English house delightfully si∣tuated
in this quarter. The landlady, who is
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
herself a native of England, we found very
obliging. The lodging-rooms are comforta∣ble;
and the entertainment is good and rea∣sonable.
There is a considerable number of
fashionable people at Florence, and many of
them in good circumstances. They affect a
gaiety in their dress, equipage, and conversa∣tion;
but stand very much on their punctilio
with strangers; and will not, without great
reluctance, admit into their assemblies any
lady of another country, whose noblesse is
not ascertained by a title. This reserve is in
some measure excusable among a people who
are extremely ignorant of foreign customs,
and who know that in their own country,
every person, even the most insignificant,
who has any pretensions to family, either
inherits, or assumes the title of <HI>principe,
conte,</HI> or <HI>marchese.</HI></P>
<P>With all their pride, however, the nobles
of Florence are humble enough to enter into
partnership with shop-keepers, and even to
sell wine by retail. It is an undoubted fact,
that in every palace or great house in this city,
there is a little window fronting the street,
provided with an iron-knocker, and over it
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
hangs an empty flask, by way of sign-post.
Thither you send your servant to buy a bottle
of wine. He knocks at the little wicket,
which is opened immediately by a domestic,
who supplies him with what he wants, and
receives the money like the waiter of any
other cabaret. It is pretty extraordinary,
that it should not be deemed a disparagement
in a nobleman to sell half a pound of figs,
or a palm of ribbon or tape, or to take
money for a flask of sour wine; and yet be
counted infamous to match his daughter in
the family of a person who has distinguished
himself in any one of the learned profes∣sions.</P>
<P>Though Florence be tolerably populous,
there seems to be very little trade of any
kind in it: but the inhabitants flatter
themselves with the prospect of reaping
great advantage from the residence of one
of the arch-dukes, for whose reception they
are now repairing the palace of Pitti. I
know not what the revenues of Tuscany may
amount to, since the succession of the princes
of Lorraine; but, under the last dukes of
the Medici family, they were said to pro∣duce
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
two millions of crowns, equal to five hun∣dred
thousand pounds sterling. These arose
from a very heavy tax upon land and houses,
the portions of maidens, and suits at law, be∣sides
the duties upon traffick, a severe gabelle
upon the necessaries of life, and a toll upon
every eatable entered into this capital. If
we may believe Leti, the grand duke was
then able to raise and maintain an army of
forty thousand infantry, and three thousand
horse; with twelve gallies, two galeasses, and
twenty ships of war. I question if Tuscany
can maintain at present above one half of
such an armament. He that now commands
the emperor's navy, consisting of a few fri∣gates,
is an Englishman, called Acton, who
was heretofore captain of a ship in our East
India company's service. He has lately em∣braced
the catholic religion, and been created
admiral of Tuscany.</P>
<P>There is a tolerable opera in Florence for
the entertainment of the best company,
though they do not seem very attentive to
the musick. Italy is certainly the native
country of this art; and yet, I do not find
the people in general either more musically
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
inclined, or better provided with ears than
their neighbours. Here is also a wretched
troop of comedians for the burgeois, and
lower class of people: but what seems most
to suit the taste of all ranks, is the exhibi∣tion
of church pageantry. I had occasion to
see a procession, where all the noblesse of the
city attended in their coaches, which filled
the whole length of the great street called the
<HI>Corso.</HI> It was the anniversary of a charitable
institution in favour of poor maidens, a cer∣tain
number of whom are portioned every
year. About two hundred of these virgins
walked in procession, two and two together,
cloathed in violet-coloured wide gowns, with
white veils on their heads, and made a very
classical appearance. They were preceded
and followed by an irregular mob of penitents
in sack-cloth, with lighted tapers, and monks
carrying crucifixes, bawling and bellowing
the litanies: but the great object was a fi∣gure
of the Virgin Mary, as big as the life,
standing within a gilt frame, dressed in a
gold stuff, with a large hoop, a great quan∣tity
of false jewels, her face painted and
patched, and her hair frizzled and curled in
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
the very extremity of the fashion. Very lit∣tle
regard had been paid to the image of our
Saviour on the cross; but when his lady-mother
appeared on the shoulders of three or
four lusty friars, the whole populace fell up∣on
their knees in the dirt. This extraordi∣nary
veneration paid to the Virgin, must
have been derived originally from the French,
who pique themselves on their gallantry to
the fair sex.</P>
<P>Amidst all the scenery of the Roman ca∣tholic
religion, I have never yet seen any of
the spectators affected at heart, or discover
the least signs of fanaticism. The very disci∣plinants,
who scourge themselves in the Holy-week,
are generally peasants or parties hired
for the purpose. Those of the confrairies,
who have an ambition to distinguish them∣selves
on such occasions, take care to secure
their backs from the smart, by means of
secret armour, either women's boddice, or
quilted jackets. The confrairies are fraterni∣ties
of devotees, who inlist themselves under
the banners of particular saints. On days
of procession they appear in a body dressed
as penitents and masked, and distinguished
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
by crosses on their habits. There is scarce
an individual, whether noble or plebeian,
who does not belong to one of these associa∣tions,
which may be compared to the Free-Masons,
Gregoreans, and Antigallicans of
England.</P>
<P>Just without one of the gates of Florence,
there is a triumphal arch erected on occasion
of the late emperor's making his public
entry, when he succeeded to the dukedom
of Tuscany: and here in the summer even∣ings,
the quality resort to take the air in their
coaches. Every carriage stops, and forms a lit∣tle
separate conversazione. The ladies sit within,
and the cicisbei stand on the foot-boards, on
each side of the coach, entertaining them
with their discourse. It would be no un∣pleasant
inquiry to trace this sort of gallantry
to its original, and investigate all its progress.
The Italians, having been accused of jea∣lousy,
were resolved to wipe off the reproach,
and, seeking to avoid it for the future, have
run into the other extreme. I know it is
generally supposed that the custom of choosing
cicisbei, was calculated to prevent the ex∣tinction
of families, which would other∣wise
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
often happen in consequence of mar∣riages
founded upon interest, without any
mutual affection in the contracting parties.
How far this political consideration may have
weighed against the jealous and vindictive
temper of the Italians, I will not pretend to
judge: but, certain it is, every married lady
in this country has her cicisbeo, or serviente,
who attends her every where, and on all oc∣casions;
and upon whose privileges the hus∣band
dares not encroach, without incurring
the censure and ridicule of the whole com∣munity.
For my part, I would rather be
condemned for life to the gallies, than exer∣cise
the office of a cicisbeo, exposed to the
intolerable caprices and dangerous resentment
of an Italian virago. I pretend not to judge
of the national character, from my own ob∣servation:
but, if the portraits drawn by
Goldoni in his Comedies are taken from na∣ture,
I would not hesitate to pronounce the
Italian women the most haughty, insolent,
capricious, and revengeful females on the
face of the earth. Indeed their resentments
are so cruelly implacable, and contain such a
mixture of perfidy, that, in my opinion,
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
they are very unfit subjects for comedy, whose
province it is, rather to ridicule folly than to
stigmatize such atrocious vice.</P>
<P>You have often heard it said, that the
purity of the Italian is to be found in the
<HI>lingua Toscana,</HI> and <HI>bocca Romana.</HI> Certain
it is, the pronunciation of the Tuscans is
disagreeably guttural: the letters C and G
they pronounce with an aspiration, which
hurts the ear of an Englishman; and is I
think rather rougher than that of the X, in
Spanish. It sounds as if the speaker had lost
his palate. I really imagined the first man I
heard speak in Pisa, had met with that mis∣fortune
in the course of his amours.</P>
<P>One of the greatest curiosities you meet with
in Italy, is the Improvisatore; such is the
name given to certain individuals, who have
the surprising talent of reciting verses extem∣pore,
on any subject you propose. Mr. Cor∣vesi,
my landlord, has a son, a Franciscan
friar, who is a great genius in this way.
When the subject is given, his brother tunes
his violin to accompany him, and he begins
to rehearse in recitative, with wonderful
fluency and precision. Thus he will, at a
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
minute's warning, recite two or three hundred
verses, well turned, and well adapted, and
generally mingled with an elegant compli∣ment
to the company. The Italians are so
fond of poetry, that many of them have the
best part of Ariosto, Tasso, and Petrarch, by
heart; and these are the great sources from
which the Improvisatori draw their rhimes,
cadence, and turns of expression. But, lest
you should think there is neither rhime nor
reason in protracting this tedious epistle, I
shall conclude it with the old burden of my
song, that I am always</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>February 5, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR entertaining letter of the fifth of
last month, was a very charitable and
a very agreeable donation: but your suspicion
is groundless. I assure you, upon my honour,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
I have no share whatever in any of the dis∣putes
which agitate the public: nor do I know
any thing of your political transactions, ex∣cept
what I casually see in one of your news∣papers,
with the perusal of which I am some∣times
favoured by our consul at Villefranche.
You insist upon my being more particular in
my remarks on what I saw at Florence, and
I shall obey the injunction. The famous gal∣lery
which contains the antiquities, is the third
story of a noble stone-edifice, built in the form
of the Greek II, the upper part fronting the
river Arno, and one of the legs adjoining to
the ducal-palace, where the courts of justice
are held. As the house of Medici had for
some centuries resided in the palace of Pitti,
situated on the other side of the river, a full
mile from these tribunals, the architect Vasari,
who planned the new edifice, at the same time
contrived a corridore, or covered passage, ex∣tending
from the palace of Pitti along one
of the bridges, to the gallery of curiosities,
through which the grand-duke passed unseen,
when he was disposed either to amuse him∣self
with his antiquities, or to assist at his
courts of judicature: but there is nothing
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
very extraordinary either in the contrivance
or execution of this corridore.</P>
<P>If I resided in Florence I would give some∣thing
extraordinary for permission to walk
every day in the gallery, which I should much
prefer to the Lycaeum, the groves of Acade∣mus,
or any porch or philosophical alley in
Athens or in Rome. Here by viewing the
statues and busts ranged on each side, I should
become acquainted with the faces of all the
remarkable personages, male and female, of
antiquity, and even be able to trace their dif∣ferent
characters from the expression of their
features. This collection is a most excellent
commentary upon the Roman historians, par∣ticularly
Suetonius and Dion Cassius. There
was one circumstance that struck me in view∣ing
the busts of Caracalla, both here and in
the Capitol at Rome; that was a certain fero∣city
in the eyes, which seemed to contradict
the sweetness of the other features, and re∣markably
justified the epithet <HI>Caracuyl,</HI> by
which he was distinguished by the antient in∣habitants
of North-Britain. In the language
of the Highlanders <HI>caracuyl</HI> signifies <HI>cruel eye,</HI>
as we are given to understand by the ingenious
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
editor of Fingal, who seems to think that
Caracalla is no other than the Celtic word,
adapted to the pronunciation of the Romans:
but the truth is, Caracalla was the name of
a Gaulish vestment, which this prince affected
to wear; and hence he derived that surname.
The Caracuyl of the Britons, is the same as
the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Greeks, which Homer
has so often applied to his Scolding Heroes.
I like the Bacchanalian, chiefly for the fine dra∣pery.
The wind, occasioned by her motion,
seems to have swelled and raised it from the
parts of the body which it covers. There is
another gay Bacchanalian, in the attitude of
dancing, crowned with ivy, holding in her
right hand a bunch of grapes, and in her
right the thyrsus. The head of the cele∣brated
Flora is very beautiful: the groupe
of Cupid and Pysche, however, did not
give me all the pleasure I expected from
it.</P>
<P>Of all the marbles that appear in the open
gallery, the following are those I most admire.
Leda with the Swan; as for Jupiter, in this
transformation, he has much the appearance
of a goose. I have not seen any thing tamer:
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
but the sculptor has admirably shewn his art
in representing Leda's hand partly hid among
the feathers, which are so lightly touched off,
that the very shape of the fingers are seen
underneath. The statue of a youth, supposed
to be Ganymede, is compared by the con∣noisseurs
to the celebrated Venus, and as far
as I can judge, not without reason: it is,
however, rather agreeable than striking, and
will please a connoisseur much more than a
common spectator. I know not whether it is
my regard to the faculty that inhances the
value of the noted Aesculapius, who appears
with a venerable beard of delicate workman∣ship.
He is larger than the life, cloathed in
a magnificent pallium, his left arm resting on
a knotted staff, round which the snake is
twined according to Ovid:
<Q><L>Hunc modo serpentem baculum qui nexibus ambit</L>
<L>Perspice—</L></Q>
He has in his hand the <HI>fascia herbarum,</HI> and
the <HI>crepidoe</HI> on his feet. There is a wild-boar re∣presented
lying on one side, which I admire
as a master-piece. The savageness of his ap∣pearance
is finely contrasted with the ease
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
and indolence of the attitude. Were I to
meet with a living boar lying with the same
expression, I should be tempted to stroke his
bristles. Here is an elegant bust of Anti∣nous,
the favourite of Adrian; and a beauti∣ful
head of Alexander the Great, turned on
one side, with an expression of languishment
and anxiety in his countenance. The virtuosi
are not agreed about the circumstance in
which he is represented; whether fainting
with the loss of blood which he suffered in
his adventure at Oxydrace; or languishing
with the fever contracted by bathing in the
Cydnus; or finally complaining to his father
Jove, that there were no other worlds for him
to conquer. The kneeling Narcissus is a
striking figure, and the expression admirable.
The two Bacchi are perfectly well executed;
but (to my shame be it spoken) I prefer to
the antique that which is the work of Michael
Angelo Buonaroti, concerning which the
story is told which you well know. The
artist having been blamed by some pre∣tended
connoisseurs, for not imitating the
manner of the ancients, is said to have pri∣vately
finished this Bacchus, and buried it,
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
after having broke off an arm, which he kept
as a voucher. The statue, being dug up by
accident, was allowed by the best judges, to
be a perfect antique; upon which Buonaroti
produced the arm, and claimed his own work.
Signior Bianchi, the keeper of this musaeum,
looks upon this as a fable; but owns that
Vasari tells such another of a child cut in
marble by the same artist, which being car∣ried
to Rome, and kept for some time under
ground, was dug up as an antique, and sold
for a great deal of money. I was likewise at∣tracted
by the Morpheus in touchstone, which
is described by Addison, who, by the bye,
notwithstanding all his taste, has been con∣victed
by Bianchi of several gross blunders in
his account of this gallery.</P>
<P>With respect to the famous Venus Pontia,
commonly called <HI>de Medicis,</HI> which was found
at Tivoli, and is kept in a separate apart∣ment
called the <HI>Tribuna,</HI> I believe I ought to
be intirely silent, or at least conceal my real
sentiments, which will otherwise appear
equally absurd and presumptuous. It must
be want of taste that prevents my feeling that
enthusiastic admiration with which others are
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
inspired at fight of this statue: a statue
which in reputation equals that of Cupid by
Praxiteles, which brought such a concourse of
strangers of old to the little town of Thespiae.
I cannot help thinking that there is no beauty
in the features of Venus; and that the atti∣tude
is aukward and out of character. It is a
bad plea to urge that the antients and we
differ in the ideas of beauty. We know the
contrary, from their medals, busts, and histo∣rians.
Without all doubt, the limbs and
proportions of this statue are elegantly formed,
and accurately designed, according to the
nicest rules of symmetry and proportion; and
the back parts especially are executed so hap∣pily,
as to excite the admiration of the most
indifferent spectator. One cannot help think∣ing
it is the very Venus of <HI>Cnidos</HI> by Prax∣iteles,
which Lucian describes. “Hercle
quanta dorsi concinnitas! ut exuberantes
lumbi amplexantes manus implent! quam
scite circumductae clunium pulpae in se ro∣tundantur,
neque tenues nimis ipsis ossibus
adstrictae, neque in immensam effusae Pingue∣dinem!”
That the statue thus described
was not the <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> would appear
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
from the Greek inscription on the base,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Cleomenes
filius Apollodori fecit;</HI> did we not know that
this inscription is counted spurious, and
that instead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, it should be
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This, however, is but a fri∣volous
objection, as we have seen many
inscriptions undoubtedly antique, in which
the orthography is false, either from the ig∣norance
or carelessness of the sculptor. Others
suppose, not without reason, that this statue
is a representation of the famous Phryne,
the courtesan of Athens, who at the cele∣bration
of the Eleusinian games, exhibited
herself coming out of the bath, naked, to
the eyes of the whole Athenian people. I
was much pleased with the dancing faun;
and still better with the Lotti, or wrestlers, the
attitudes of which are beautifully contrived
to shew the different turns of the limbs, and
the swelling of the muscles: but, what pleased
me best of all the statues in the Tribuna was
the Arrotino, commonly called the Whetter,
and generally supposed to represent a slave,
who in the act of whetting a knife, overhears
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
the conspiracy of Cataline. You know he is
represented on one knee; and certain it is, I
never saw such an expression of anxious at∣tention,
as appears in his countenance. But
it is not mingled with any marks of surprise,
such as could not fail to lay hold on a man
who overhears by accident a conspiracy against
the state. The marquis de Maffei has justly
observed that Sallust, in his very circum∣stantial
detail of that conspiracy, makes no
mention of any such discovery. Neither does
it appear, that the figure is in the act of
whetting, the stone which he holds in one
hand being rough and unequal, no ways re∣sembling
a whetstone. Others alledge it re∣presents
Milico, the freedman of Scaevinus,
who conspired against the life of Nero, and
gave his poignard to be whetted to Milico,
who presented it to the emperor, with an
account of the conspiracy: but the attitude
and expression will by no means admit of this
interpretation. Signore Bianchi, who is him∣self
a learned and judicious antiquarian,
thinks the statue represents the augur Attius
Navius, who cut a stone with a knife, at the
command of Tarquinius Priscus. This con∣jecture
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
seems to be confirmed by a medallion
of Antoninus Pius, inserted by Vaillant among
his Numismata Prestantiora, on which is de∣lineated
nearly such a figure as this in ques∣tion,
with the following legend, “Attius
Navius genuflexus ante Tarquinium Priscum
cotem cultro discidit.” He owns indeed that
in the statue, the augur is not distinguished
either by his habit or emblems; and he
might have added, neither is the stone a cotes.
For my own part, I think neither of these
three opinions is satisfactory, though the last
is very ingenious. Perhaps the figure alludes
to a private incident, which never was re∣corded
in any history. Among the great
number of pictures in this Tribuna, I was
most charmed with the Venus by Titian,
which has a sweetness of expression and ten∣derness
of colouring, not to be described. In
this apartment, they reckon three hundred
pieces, the greatest part by the best masters,
particularly by Raphael, in the three manners
by which he distinguished himself at different
periods of his life. As for the celebrated
statue of the hermaphodrite, which we find
in another room, I give the sculptor credit for
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
his ingenuity in mingling the sexes in the
composition; but it is, at best, no other than
a monster in nature, which I never had any
pleasure in viewing: nor, indeed, do I think
there was much talent required in repre∣senting
a figure with the head and breasts
of a woman, and all the other parts of the
body masculine. There is such a profusion
of curiosities in this celebrated musaeum;
statues, busts, pictures, medals, tables inlaid
in the way of marquetry, cabinets adorned
with precious stones, jewels of all sorts, ma∣thematical
instruments, antient arms and
military machines, that the imagination is
bewildered; and a stranger of a visionary turn,
would be apt to fancy himself in a palace of
the fairies, raised and adorned by the power
of inchantment.</P>
<P>In one of the detached apartments, I saw
the antependium of the altar, designed for the
famous chapel of St. Lorenzo. It is a curious
piece of architecture, inlaid with coloured mar∣ble
and precious stones, so as to represent
an infinite variety of natural objects. It is
adorned with some crystal pillars, with ca∣pitals
of beaten gold. The second story of
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
the building is occupied by a great number
of artists employed in this very curious work
of marquetry, representing figures with gems
and different kinds of coloured marble, for
the use of the emperor. The Italians call it
<HI>pietre commesse,</HI> a sort of inlaying with stones,
analogous to the fineering of cabinets in
wood. It is peculiar to Florence, and seems
to be still more curious than the Mosaic
work, which the Romans have brought to
great perfection.</P>
<P>The cathedral of Florence is a great Gothic
building, encrusted on the outside with mar∣ble;
it is remarkable for nothing but its
cupola, which is said to have been copied by
the architect of St. Peter's at Rome, and for
it's size, which is much greater than that of
any other church in Christendom. The bap∣tistery,
which stands by it, was an antient
temple, said to be dedicated to Mars. There
are some good statues of marble within; and
one or two of bronze on the outside of the
doors; but it is chiefly celebrated for the
embossed work of its brass gates, by Lorenzo
Ghiberti, which Buonaroti used to say, de∣served
to be made the gates of Paradise. I
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
viewed them with pleasure: but still I re∣tained
a greater veneration for those of Pisa,
which I had first admired: a preference
which either arises from want of taste, or
from the charm of novelty, by which the
former were recommended to my attention.
Those who would have a particular de∣tail
of every thing worth seeing at Florence,
comprehending churches, libraries, palaces,
tombs, statues, pictures, fountains, bridges,
&amp;c. may consult Keysler, who is so laboriously
circumstantial in his descriptions, that I never
could peruse them, without suffering the head∣ach,
and recollecting the old observation, That
the German genius lies more in the back
than in the brain.</P>
<P>I was much disappointed in the chapel of
St. Lorenzo. Notwithstanding the great pro∣fusion
of granite, porphyry, jasper, verde an∣tico,
lapis-lazuli, and other precious stones,
representing figures in the way of marquetry,
I think the whole has a gloomy effect. These
<HI>pietre commesse</HI> are better calculated for cabi∣nets,
than for ornaments to great buildings,
which ought to be large masses proportioned
to the greatness of the edifice. The com∣partments
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
are so small, that they produce no
effect in giving the first impression when one
enters the place; except to give an air of
littleness to the whole, just as if a grand
saloon was covered with pictures painted in
miniature. If they have as little regard to
proportion and perspective, when they paint
the dome, which is not yet finished, this cha∣pel,
will in my opinion, remain a monument
of ill taste and extravagance.</P>
<P>The court of the palace of Pitti is formed
by three sides of an elegant square, with ar∣cades
all round, like the palace of Holyrood
house at Edinburgh; and the rustic work,
which constitues the lower part of the build∣ing,
gives it an air of strength and magni∣ficence.
In this court, there is a fine fountain,
in which the water trickles down from above;
and here is also an admirable antique statue
of Hercules, inscribed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
the work of Lysippus.</P>
<P>The apartments of this palace are generally
small, and many of them dark. Among the
paintings, the most remarkable is the Ma∣donna
de la Seggiola, by Raphael, counted
one of the best coloured pieces of that great
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
master. If I was allowed to find fault with
the performance, I should pronounce it de∣fective
in dignity and sentiment. It is the
expression of a peasant rather than of the
mother of God. She exhibits the fondness
and joy of a young woman towards her first-born
son, without that rapture of admiration
which we expect to find in the Virgin Mary,
while she contemplates, in the fruit of her
own womb, the Saviour of mankind. In
other respects, it is a fine figure, gay, agree∣able,
and very expressive of maternal tender∣ness;
and the <HI>bambino</HI> is extremely beautiful.
There was an English painter employed in
copying this picture, and what he had done
was executed with great success. I am one
of those who think it very possible to imitate
the best pieces in such a manner, that even
the connoisseurs shall not be able to dis∣tinguish
the original from the copy. After
all, I do not set up for a judge in these mat∣ters,
and very likely I may incur the ri∣dicule
of the virtuosi for the remarks I have
made: but I am used to speak my mind
freely on all subjects that fall under the
cognizance of my senses; though I must
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
as freely own, there is something more than
common sense required to discover and dis∣tinguish
the more delicate beauties of paint∣ing.
I can safely say, however, that without
any daubing at all, I am, very sincerely,</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate humble servant,</CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>February 20, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING seen all the curiosities of
Florence, and hired a good travelling
coach for seven weeks, at the price of seven
zequines, something less than three guineas
and a half, we set out post for Rome, by
the way of Sienna, where we lay the first
night. The country through which we passed
is mountainous but agreeable. Of Sienna
I can say nothing from my own observation,
but that we were indifferently lodged in a
house that stunk like a privy, and fared
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
wretchedly at supper. The city is large and
well built: the inhabitants pique themselves
upon their politeness, and the purity of their
dialect. Certain it is, some strangers reside
in this place on purpose to learn the best pro∣nunciation
of the Italian tongue. The Mo∣saic
pavement of their duomo, or cathedral,
has been much admired; as well as the
history of Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards pope
Pius II. painted on the walls of the library,
partly by Pietro Perugino, and partly by his
pupil Raphael D'Urbino.</P>
<P>Next day, at Buon Convento, where the
emperor Henry VII. was poisoned by a friar
with the sacramental wafer, I refused to give
money to the hostler, who in revenge put two
young unbroke stone-horses in the traces next
to the coach, which became so unruly, that
before we had gone a quarter of a mile, they
and the postilion were rolling in the dust. In
this situation they made such efforts to disen∣gage
themselves, and kicked with such violence,
that I imagined the carriage and all our trunks
would have been beaten in pieces. We leaped
out of the coach, however, without sustain∣ing
any personal damage, except the fright;
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
nor was any hurt done to the vehicle. But
the horses were terribly bruised, and almost
strangled, before they could be disengaged.
Exasperated at the villany of the hostler, I
resolved to make a complaint to the magi∣strate
of the place, who is called <HI>uffiziale.</HI>
I found him wrapped in an old, greasy,
ragged, great-coat, sitting in a wretched
apartment, without either glass, paper, or
boards in the windows; and there was no
sort of furniture but a couple of broken
chairs and a miserable truckle-bed. He
looked pale, meagre, and haggard, and had
more the air of a half-starved prisoner than
of a magistrate. Having heard my com∣plaint,
he came forth into a kind of outward
room or bellfrey, and rung a great bell with
his own hand. In consequence of this signal,
the post-master came up stairs, and I suppose
he was the first man in the place, for the
<HI>uffiziale</HI> stood before him cap-in-hand, and
with great marks of humble respect repeated
the complaint I had made. This man assured
me, with an air of conscious importance, that
he himself had ordered the hostler to supply
me with those very horses, which were the
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
best in his stable; and that the misfortune
which happened was owing to the misconduct
of the fore-postilion, who did not keep the
fore horses to a proper speed proportioned to
the mettle of the other two. As he took the
affair upon himself, and I perceived had an
ascendancy over the magistrate, I contented
myself with saying, I was certain the two
horses had been put to the coach on purpose,
either to hurt or frighten us; and that since I
could not have justice here I would make a
formal complaint to the British minister at
Florence. In passing through the street to
the coach, which was by this time furnished
with fresh horses, I met the hostler, and would
have caned him heartily; but perceiving my
intention, he took to his heels and vanished.
Of all the people I have ever seen, the host∣lers,
postilions, and other fellows hanging a∣bout
the post-houses in Italy, are the most
greedy, impertinent, and provoking. Happy
are those travellers who have phlegm enough
to disregard their insolence and importunity:
for this is not so disagreeable as their revenge
is dangerous. An English gentleman at
Florence told me, that one of those fellows,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
whom he had struck for his impertinence,
flew at him with a long knife, and he could
hardly keep him at sword's point. All of
them wear such knives, and are very apt to
use them on the slightest provocation. But
their open attacks are not so formidable as
their premeditated schemes of revenge; in the
prosecution of which the Italians are equally
treacherous and cruel.</P>
<P>This night we passed at a place called
Radicofani, a village and fort, situated on
the top of a very high mountain. The inn
stands still lower than the town. It was
built at the expence of the last grand-duke
of Tuscany; is very large, very cold, and un∣comfortable.
One would imagine it was con∣trived
for coolness, though situated so high,
that even in the midst of summer, a travel∣ler
would be glad to have a fire in his cham∣ber.
But few, or none of them have fire∣places,
and there is not a bed with curtains
or tester in the house. All the adjacent
country is naked and barren. On the third
day we entered the pope's territories, some
parts of which are delightful. Having passed
Aqua-Pendente, a beggarly town, situated on
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
the top of a rock, from whence there is a
romantic cascade of water, which gives it
the name, we travelled along the side of the
lake Bolsena, a beautiful piece of water about
thirty miles in circuit, with two islands in
the middle, the banks covered with noble
plantations of oak and cypress. The town
of Bolsena standing near the ruins of the
antient Volsinium, which was the birth-place
of Sejanus, is a paultry village; and Monte∣siascone,
famous for its wine, is a poor de∣cayed
town in this neighbourhood, situated
on the side of a hill, which, according
to the author of the Grand Tour, was
the only directory I had along with me, is
supposed to be the Soracte of the ancients. If
we may believe Horace, Soracte was visible
from Rome: for, in his ninth ode, addressed
to Thaliarchus, he says,
<Q><L>Vides, ut alta stet nive candidum</L>
<L>Soracte—</L></Q>
but, in order to see Montefiascone, his eye∣sight
must have penetrated through the Mons
Cyminus, at the foot of which stands the
city of Viterbo. Pliny tells us, that Soracte
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
was not far from Rome, <HI>haud procul ab urbe
Roma;</HI> but Montefiascone is fifty miles from
this city. And Desprez, in his notes upon
Horace, says it is now called Monte S. Oreste.
Addison tells us he passed by it in the Cam∣pania.
I could not without indignation re∣flect
upon the bigotry of Mathilda, who
gave this fine country to the see of Rome,
under the dominion of which no country
was ever known to prosper.</P>
<P>About half way between Montefiascone
and Viterbo, one of our fore-wheels flew off,
together with a large splinter of the axle-tree;
and if one of the postilions had not
by great accident been a remarkably ingeni∣ous
fellow, we should have been put to the
greatest inconvenience, as there was no town,
or even house, within several miles. I men∣tion
this circumstance, by way of warning to
other travellers, that they may provide them∣selves
with a hammer and nails, a spare iron-pin
or two, a large knife, and bladder of
grease, to be used occasionally in case of such
misfortune.</P>
<P>The mountain of Viterbo is covered with
beautiful plantations and villas belonging to
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
the Roman nobility, who come hither to make
the <HI>villegiatura</HI> in summer. Of the city of
Viterbo I shall say nothing, but that it is the
capital of that country which Mathilda gave
to the Roman see. The place is well built,
adorned with public fountains, and a great
number of churches and convents; yet far
from being populous, the whole number of
inhabitants, not exceeding fifteen thousand.
The post-house is one of the worst inns I ever
entered.</P>
<P>After having passed this mountain, the
Cyminus of the antients, we skirted part of
the lake, which is now called de Vico, and
whose banks afford the most agreeable rural
prospects of hill and vale, wood, glade and
water, shade and sun-shine. A few other
very inconsiderable places we passed, and de∣scended
into the Campania of Rome, which
is almost a desert. The view of this coun∣try,
in its present situation, cannot but pro∣duce
emotions of pity and indignation in the
mind of every person who retains any idea of
its antient cultivation and fertility. It is no∣thing
but a naked withered down, desolate
and dreary, almost without inclosure, corn∣field,
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
hedge, tree, shrub, house, hut, or habi∣tation;
exhibiting here and there the ruins of
an antient castellum, tomb, or temple, and
in some places the remains of a Roman via.
I heard much of these antient works, and
was greatly disappointed when I saw them.
The Via Cassia or Cymina is paved with
broad, solid, flint-stones, which must have
greatly incommoded the feet of horses that
travelled upon it, as well as endangered the
lives of the riders from the slipperiness of
the pavement: besides, it is so narrow that
two modern carriages could not pass one
another upon it, without the most imminent
hazard of being overturned. I am still of
opinion that we excel the ancient Romans in
understanding the conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>The Grand Tour says, that within four
miles of Rome you see a tomb on the road∣side,
said to be that of Nero, with sculpture
in basso relievo at both ends. I did see such
a thing more like a common grave-stone,
than the tomb of an emperor. But we are
informed by Suetonius, that the dead body of
Nero, who slew himself at the villa of his
freedman, was by the care of his two nurses
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
and his concubine Atta, removed to the se∣pulchre
of the Gens Domitia, immediately
within the Porta del Popolo, on your left
hand as you enter Rome, precisely on the
spot where now stands the church of S. Maria
del Popolo. His tomb was even distinguish∣ed
by an epitaph, which has been preserved by
Gruterus. Giacomo Alberici tells us very
gravely in his History of the Church, that a
great number of devils, who guarded the
bones of this wicked emperor, took posses∣sion,
in the shape of black ravens, of a wal∣nut-tree,
which grew upon the spot; from
whence they insulted every passenger, until
pope Paschal II. in consequence of a solemn
fast and a revelation, went thither in procession
with his court and cardinals, cut down the
tree, burned it to ashes, which, with the
bones of Nero, were thrown into the Tyber:
then he consecrated an altar on the place,
where afterwards the church was built. You
may guess what I felt at first sight of the city
of Rome, which, notwithstanding all the ca∣lamities
it has undergone, still maintains an
august and imperial appearance. It stands
on the farther side of the Tyber, which we
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
crossed at the Ponte Molle, formerly called
Pons Milvius, about two miles from the gate
by which we entered. This bridge was built
by Aemilius Censor, whose name it originally
bore. It was the road by which so many
heroes returned with conquest to their coun∣try;
by which so many kings were led cap∣tive
to Rome; and by which the ambassadors
of so many kingdoms and states approached
the seat of empire, to deprecate the wrath,
to sollicit the friendship, or sue for the pro∣tection
of the Roman people. It is likewise
famous for the defeat and death of Maxentius,
who was here overcome by Constantine the
Great. The space between the bridge and
Porta del Popolo, on the right-hand, which
is now taken up with gardens and villas, was
part of the antient Campus Martius, where the
comitiae were held; and where the Roman peo∣ple
inured themselves to all manner of exercises:
it was adorned with porticos, temples, theatres,
baths, circi, basilicae, obelisks, columns, statues,
and groves. Authors differ in their opinions
about the extent of it; but as they all agree
that it contained the Pantheon, the Circus
Agonis, now the Piazza Navona, the Bustum
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
and Mausoleum Augusti, great part of the
modern city must be built upon the antient
Campus Martius. The highway that leads
from the bridge to the city, is part of the Via
Flaminia, which extended as far as Rimini;
and is well paved, like a modern street. No∣thing
of the antient bridge remains but the
piles; nor is there any thing in the structure
of this, or of the other five Roman bridges
over the Tyber, that deserves attention. I
have not seen any bridge in France or Italy,
comparable to that of Westminster, either in
beauty, magnificence, or solidity; and when
the bridge at Black-Friars is finished, it will
be such a monument of architecture as all the
world cannot parallel. As for the Tyber, it
is, in comparison with the Thames, no more
than an inconsiderable stream, foul, deep,
and rapid; navigable by small boats, barks,
and lighters; and, for the conveniency of
loading and unloading them, there is a hand∣some
quay by the new custom-house, at the
Porto di Ripetta, provided with stairs of
each side, and adorned with an elegant
fountain, that yields abundance of excellent
water.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
We are told that the bed of this river has
been considerably raised by the rubbish of old
Rome, and this is the reason usually given
for its being so apt to overflow its banks.
A citizen of Rome told me, that a friend of
his lately digging to lay the foundation of a
new house in the lower part of the city, near
the bank of the river, discovered the pavement
of an antient street, at the depth of thirty-nine
feet from the present surface of the
earth. He therefore concluded that modern
Rome is near forty feet higher in this place,
than the site of the antient city, and that the
bed of the river is raised in proportion; but
this is altogether incredible. Had the bed of
the Tyber been antiently forty feet lower at
Rome, than it is at present, there must have
been a fall or cataract in it immediately above
this tract, as it is not pretended that the bed
of it is raised in any part above the city;
otherwise such an elevation would have ob∣structed
its course, and then it would have
overflowed the whole Campania. There is
nothing extraordinary in its present over∣flowings:
they frequently happened of old,
and did great mischief to the antient city.
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
Appian, Dio, and other historians, describe an
inundation of the Tiber immediately after
the death of Julius Caesar, which inundation
was occasioned by the sudden melting of a
great quantity of snow which had fallen upon
the Appenines. This calamity is recorded
by Horace in his ode to Augustus.</P>

The Porta del Popolo (formerly, Flami∣nia,)
by which we entered Rome, is an ele∣gant
piece of architecture, adorned with
marble columns and statues, and executed
after the design of Buonaroti. Within side
you find yourself in a noble piazza, from
whence three of the principal streets of Rome
are detached. It is adorned with the famous
Aegyptian obelisk, brought hither from the
Circus Maximus, and set up by the archi∣tect
Dominico Fontana in the pontificate of
Sixtus V. Here is likewise a beautiful foun∣tain
designed by the same artist; and at the
beginning of the two principal streets, are
two very elegant churches fronting each
other. Such an august entrance cannot fail
to impress the stranger with a sublime idea of
this venerable city.</P>
<P>Having given our names at the gate, we
repaired to the dogana, or custom-house,
where our trunks and carriage were searched;
and here we were surrounded by a number of
servitori de piazza, offering their services with
the most disagreable importunity. Though
I told them several times I had no occasion for
any, three of them took possession of the
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
coach, one mounting before and two of them
behind; and thus we proceeded to the Piazza
d'Espagna, where the person lived to whose
house I was directed. Strangers that come to
Rome seldom put up at public inns, but go
directly to lodging houses, of which there is
great plenty in this quarter. The Piazza
d'Espagna is open, airy, and pleasantly si∣tuated
in a high part of the city immediately
under the Colla Pinciana, and adorned with
two fine fountains. Here most of the English
reside: the apartments are generally commo∣dious
and well furnished; and the lodgers
are well supplied with provisions and all
necessaries of life. But, if I studied oeco∣nomy,
I would choose another part of the
town than the Piazza d'Espagna, which is,
besides, at a great distance from the anti∣quities.
For a decent first floor and two
bed-chambers on the second, I payed no
more than a scudo (five shillings) per day.
Our table was plentifully furnished by the
landlord for two and thirty pauls, being equal
to sixteen shillings. I hired a town-coach at
the rate of fourteen pauls, or seven shillings a
day; and a servitore di piazza for three pauls,
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
or eighteen-pence. The coachman has also
an allowance of two pauls a day. The pro∣visions
at Rome are reasonable and good,
especially the vitella mongana, which is the
most delicate veal I ever tasted, but very dear,
being sold for two pauls, or a shilling, the
pound. Here are the rich wines of Monte∣pulciano,
Montefiascone, and Monte di Dra∣gone;
but what we commonly drink at meals
is that of Orvieto, a small white wine, of an
agreeable flavour. Strangers are generally
advised to employ an antiquarian to instruct
them in all the curiosities of Rome; and
this is a necessary expence, when a person
wants to become a connoisseur in painting,
statuary, and architecture. For my own part
I had no such ambition. I longed to view
the remains of antiquity by which this me∣tropolis
is distinguished; and to contemplate
the originals of many pictures and statues,
which I had admired in prints and descripti∣ons.
I therefore chose a servant, who was re∣commended
to me as a sober intelligent fel∣low,
acquainted with these matters: at the
same time I furnished myself with maps and
plans of antient and modern Rome, toge∣ther
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
with the little manual, called, <HI>Itinerario
istruttivo per ritrovare con facilita tutte le mag∣nificenze
di Roma e di alcune citta', e castelli
suburbani.</HI> But I found still more satisfaction
in perusing the book in three volumes, in∣titled,
<HI>Roma antica, e moderna,</HI> which contains
a description of every thing remarkable in
and about the city, illustrated with a great
number of copper-plates, and many curious
historical annotations. This directory cost
me a zequine; but a hundred zequines will
not purchase all the books and prints which
have been published at Rome on these sub∣jects.
Of these the most celebrated are the
plates of Piranefi, who is not only an ingeni∣ous
architect and engraver, but also a learned
antiquarian; though he is apt to run riot in
his conjectures; and with regard to the arts
of antient Rome, has broached some doc∣trines,
which he will find it very difficult to
maintain. Our young gentlemen who go to
Rome will do well to be upon their guard
against a set of sharpers, (some of them of
our own country,) who deal in pictures and
antiques, and very often impose upon the
uninformed stranger, by selling him trash,
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
as the productions of the most celebrated
artists. The English are more than any
other foreigners exposed to this imposition.
They are supposed to have more money to
throw away; and therefore a greater num∣ber
of snares are layed for them. This opi∣nion
of their superior wealth they take a
pride in confirming, by launching out into
all manner of unnecessary expence: but,
what is still more dangerous, the moment
they set foot in Italy, they are seized with the
ambition of becoming connoisseurs in paint∣ing,
musick, statuary, and architecture; and
the adventurers of this country do not fail
to flatter this weakness for their own advan∣tage.
I have seen in different parts of Italy,
a number of raw boys, whom Britain seemed
to have poured forth on purpose to bring her
national character into contempt: ignorant,
petulant, rash, and profligate, without any
knowledge or experience of their own, without
any director to improve their understanding,
or superintend their conduct. One engages
in play with an infamous gamester, and is
stripped perhaps in the very first partie:
another is poxed and pillaged by an anti∣quated
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
cantatrice: a third is bubbled by a
knavish antiquarian; and a fourth is laid
under contribution by a dealer in pictures.
Some turn fiddlers, and pretend to compose:
but all of them talk familiarly of the arts,
and return finished connoisseurs and cox∣combs,
to their own country. The most re∣markable
phaenomenon of this kind, which
I have seen, is a boy of seventy-two, now
actually travelling through Italy, for im∣provement,
under the auspices of another
boy of twenty-two. When you arrive at
Rome, you receive cards from all your coun∣try-folks
in that city: they expect to have
the visit returned next day, when they give
orders not to be at home; and you never
speak to one another in the sequel. This is
a refinement in hospitality and politeness,
which the English have invented by the
strength of their own genius, without any
assistance either from France, Italy, or Lap∣land.
No Englishman above the degree of
a painter or cicerone frequents any coffee-house
at Rome; and as there are no public
diversions, except in carnival-time, the only
chance you have for seeing you compatriots,
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
is either in visiting the curiosities, or at a con∣versazione.
The Italians are very scrupulous
in admitting foreigners, except those who are
introduced as people of quality: but if there
happens to be any English lady of fashion at
Rome, she generally keeps an assembly, to
which the British subjects resort. In my next,
I shall communicate, without ceremony or
affectation, what further remarks I have
made at Rome, without any pretence, how∣ever
to the character of a connoisseur, which,
without all doubt, would sit very aukwardly
upon,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be more agreeable to
the eyes of a stranger, especially in
the heats of summer, than the great num∣ber
of public fountains that appear in every
part of Rome, embellished with all the or∣naments
of sculpture, and pouring forth
prodigious quantities of cool, delicious water,
brought in aqueducts from different lakes,
rivers, and sources, at a considerable distance
from the city. These works are the remains
of the munificence and industry of the an∣tient
Romans, who were extremely delicate
in the article of water: but, however, great
applause is also due to those beneficent popes
who have been at the expence of restoring
and repairing those noble channels of health,
pleasure, and convenience. This great plenty
of water, nevertheless, has not induced the
Romans to be cleanly. Their streets, and
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
even their palaces, are disgraced with filth.
The noble Piazza Navona, is adorned with
three or four fountains, one of which is per∣haps
the most magnificent that Europe can
produce, and all of them discharge vast streams
of water: but, notwithstanding this pro∣vision,
the piazza is almost as dirty as West
Smithfield, where the cattle are sold in London.
The corridores, arcades, and even stair-cases
belonging to their most elegant palaces, are
depositories of nastiness, and indeed in sum∣mer
smell as strong as spirit of hartshorn.
I have a great notion that their ancestors
were not much more cleanly. If we con∣sider
that the city and suburbs of Rome, in
the reign of Claudius, contained about seven
millions of inhabitants, a number equal at
least to the sum total of all the souls in Eng∣land;
that great part of antient Rome was
allotted to temples, porticos, basilicae, the∣atres,
thermae, circi, public and private
walks and gardens, where very few, if any,
of this great number lodged; that by far
the greater part of those inhabitants were
slaves and poor people, who did not enjoy the
conveniencies of life; and that the use of
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
linen was scarce known; we must naturally
conclude they were strangely crouded toge∣ther,
and that in general they were a very
frowzy generation. That they were crouded
together appears from the height of their
houses, which the poet Rutilius compared to
towers made for scaling heaven. In order to
remedy this inconvenience, Augustus Caesar
published a decree, that for the future no
houses should be built above seventy feet high,
which, at a moderate computation, might
make six stories. But what seems to prove,
beyond all dispute, that the antient Romans
were dirty creatures, are these two particu∣lars.
Vespasian laid a tax upon urine and
ordure, on pretence of being at a great ex∣pence
in clearing the streets from such nu∣sances;
an imposition which amounted to
about fourteen pence a year for every indi∣vidual;
and when Heliogabalus ordered all
the cobwebs of the city and suburbs to be
collected, they were found to weigh ten thou∣sand
pounds. This was intended as a de∣monstration
of the great number of inha∣bitants;
but it was a proof of their dirt,
rather than of their populosity. I might
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
likewise add, the delicate custom of taking
vomits at each other's houses, when they were
invited to dinner, or supper, that they might
prepare their stomachs for gormandizing; a
beastly proof of their nastiness as well as
gluttony. Horace, in his description of the
banquet of Nasiedenus, says, when the ca∣nopy,
under which they sat, fell down, it
brought along with it as much dirt as is
raised by a hard gale of wind in dry weather.
<Q><L>—“trahentia pulveris atri,</L>
<L>Quantum non aquilo Campanis excitat agris.”</L></Q>
I might observe, that the streets were often
encumbered with the putrifying carcasses of
criminals, who had been dragged through
them by the heels, and precipitated from the
<HI>Scalae Gemoniae,</HI> or Tarpeian rock, before they
were thrown into the Tyber, which was the
general receptacle of the <HI>cloaca maxima</HI> and
all the filth of Rome: besides, the bodies of
all those who made away with themselves,
without sufficient cause; of such as were
condemned for sacrilege, or killed by thun∣der,
were left unburned and unburied, to rot
above ground.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100"/>
I believe the moderns retain more of the
customs of the antient Romans, than is ge∣nerally
imagined. When I first saw the in∣fants
at the <HI>enfans trouvés</HI> in Paris, so swathed
with bandages, that the very sight of them
made my eyes water, I little dreamed, that
the prescription of the antients could be
pleaded for this custom, equally shocking and
absurd: but in the Capitol at Rome, I met
with the antique statue of a child <HI>emailloté</HI>
exactly in the same manner; rolled up like
an Aegyptian mummy from the feet. The
circulation of the blood, in such a case, must
be obstructed on the whole surface of the
body; and nothing at liberty but the head,
which is the only part of the child that
ought to be confined. Is it not surprising
that common sense should not point out,
even to the most ignorant, that those ac∣cursed
bandages must heat the tender infant
into a fever; must hinder the action of the
muscles, and the play of the joints, so neces∣sary
to health and nutrition; and that while
the refluent blood is obstructed in the veins,
which run on the surface of the body, the
arteries, which lie deep, without the reach
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
of compression, are continually pouring their
contents into the head, where the blood meets
with no resistance? The vessels of the brain
are naturally lax, and the very futures of the
skull are yet unclosed. What are the conse∣quences
of this cruel swaddling? the limbs
are wasted; the joints grow rickety; the
brain is compressed, and a hydrocephalus,
with a great head and sore eyes, ensues. I
take this abominable practice to be one
great cause of the bandy legs, diminutive bo∣dies,
and large heads, so frequent in the south
of France, and in Italy.</P>
<P>I was no less surprised to find the modern
fashion of curling the hair, borrowed in a
great measure from the coxcombs and co∣quettes
of antiquity. I saw a bust of Nero
in the gallery at Florence, the hair represented
in rows of buckles, like that of a French
petit-maitre, conformable to the picture drawn
of him by Suetonius. <HI>Circa cultum adeo pu∣dendum,
ut coman semper in gradus formatam
peregrinatione achaica, etiam pene verticem
sumpserit.</HI> I was very sorry however to find that
this foppery came from Greece. As for Otho,
he wore a galericulum, or tour, on account
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
of thin hair, <HI>propter raritatem capillorum.</HI>
He had no right to imitate the example of
Julius Caesar, who concealed his bald head
with a wreath of laurel. But there is a bust
in the Capitol of Julia Pia, the second wife
of Septimius Severus, with a moveable peruke,
dressed exactly in the fashionable mode, with
this difference, that there is no part of it
frizzled; nor is there any appearance of po∣matum
and powder. These improvements
the beau-monde have borrowed from the
natives of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Modern Rome does not cover more than
one-third of the space within the walls; and
those parts that were most frequented of old
are now intirely abandoned. From the Ca∣pitol
to the Coliseum, including the Forum
Romanum and Boarium, there is nothing in∣tire
but one or two churches, built with the
fragments of ancient edifices. You descend
from the Capitol between the remaining pil∣lars
of two temples, the pedestals and part of
the shafts sunk in the rubbish: then passing
through the triumphal arch of Septimius Se∣verus,
you proceed along the foot of Mons
Palatinus, which stands on your right hand,
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
quite covered with the ruins of the antient
palace belonging to the Roman emperors, and
at the foot of it, there are some beautiful de∣tached
pillars still standing. On the left you
see the remains of the <HI>Templum Pacis,</HI> which
seems to have been the largest and most mag∣nificent
of all the temples in Rome. It was
built and dedicated by the emperor Vespasian,
who brought into it all the treasure and preci∣ous
vessels which he found in the temple of
Jerusalem. The columns of the portico he
removed from Nero's golden house, which he
levelled with the ground. This temple was
likewise famous for its library, mentioned by
Aulus Gellius. Farther on, is the arch of
Constantine on the right, a most noble piece
of architecture, almost entire; with the re∣mains
of the <HI>Meta Sudans</HI> before it; and front∣ing
you, the noble ruins of that vast amphi∣theatre,
called the Colossaeum, now Coliseo,
which has been dismantled and dilapidated
by the Gothic popes and princes of modern
Rome, to build and adorn their paultry pa∣laces.
Behind the amphitheatre were the
thermae of the same emperor Titus Vespasian.
In the same quarter was the <HI>Circus Maximus;</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
and the whole space from hence on both sides,
to the walls of Rome, comprehending above
twice as much ground as the modern city, is
almost covered with the monuments of anti∣quity.
I suppose there is more concealed
below ground than appears above. The mi∣serable
houses, and even garden-walls of the
peasants in this district, are built with these
precious materials, I mean shafts and capitals
of marble columns, heads, arms, legs, and
mutilated trunks of statues. What pity it
is that among all the remains of antiquity, at
Rome, there is not one lodging-house re∣maining.
I should be glad to know how the
senators of Rome were lodged. I want to
be better informed touching the <HI>cava oedium,</HI>
the <HI>focus,</HI> the <HI>ara deorum penatum,</HI> the <HI>concla∣via,
trilinica,</HI> and <HI>coenationes;</HI> the <HI>atria</HI> where
the women resided, and employed themselves
in the woolen manufacture; the <HI>proetoria,</HI>
which were so spacious as to become a nu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance
in the reign of Augustus; and the
<HI>Xysta,</HI> which were shady walks between two
porticos, where the men exercised themselves in
the winter. I am disgusted by the modern
taste of architecture, though I am no judge
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
of the art. The churches and palaces of
these days are crowded with petty orna∣ments,
which distract the eye, and by break∣ing
the design into a variety of little parts,
destroy the effect of the whole. Every door
and window has its separate ornaments, its
moulding, frize, cornice, and tympanum;
then there is such an assemblage of useless
festoons, pillars, pilasters, with their archi∣traves,
entablatures, and I know not what,
that nothing great or uniform remains to fill
the view; and we in vain look for that sim∣plicity
of grandeur, those large masses of light
and shadow, and the inexpressible <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which characterise the edifices of the
antients. A great edifice, to have its full
effect, ought to be <HI>isolé,</HI> that is detached from
all others, with a large space around it: but
the palaces of Rome, and indeed of all the
other cities of Italy, which I have seen, are
so engaged among other mean houses, that
their beauty and magnificence are in a great
measure concealed. Even those which face
open streets and piazzas are only clear in
front. The other apartments are darkened
by the vicinity of ordinary houses; and their
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
views are confined by dirty and disagreeable
objects. Within the court there is generally
a noble colonnade all round, and an open
corridore above: but the stairs are usually
narrow, steep, and high: the want of fash∣windows,
the dullness of their small glass
lozenges, the dusty brick floors, and the
crimson hangings laced with gold, contribute
to give a gloomy air to their apartments; I
might add to these causes, a number of pic∣tures
executed on melancholy subjects, an∣tique
mutilated statues, busts, basso relievos,
urns, and sepulchral stones, with which their
rooms are adorned. It must be owned, how∣ever,
there are some exceptions to this general
rule. The villa of cardinal Alexander Al∣bani
is light, gay, and airy; yet the rooms
are too small, and too much decorated with
carving and gilding, which is a kind of
gingerbread work. The apartments of one
of the princes Borghese are furnished in the
English taste; and in the <HI>palazzo di colonna
connestabile,</HI> there is a saloon, or gallery, which,
for the proportions, lights, furniture, and or∣naments,
is the most noble, elegant, and agree∣able
apratment I ever saw.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107"/>
It is diverting to hear an Ialian expatiate
upon the greatness of modern Rome. He
will tell you there are above three hundred
palaces in the city; that there is scarce a
Roman prince, whose revenue does not ex∣ceed
two hundred thousand crowns; and that
Rome produces not only the most learned
men, but also the most refined politicians in
the universe. To one of them talking in this
strain, I replied, that instead of three hun∣dred
palaces, the number did not exceed
fourscore; that I had been informed, on good
authority, there were not six individuals in
Rome who had so much as forty thousand
crowns a year, about ten thousand pounds
sterling; and that to say their princes were
so rich, and their politicians so refined, was,
in effect, a severe s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tire upon them, for not
employing their wealth and their talents for
the advantage of their country. I asked why
their cardinals and princes did not invite and
encourage industrious people to settle and
cultivate the Campania of Rome, which is a
desert? why they did not raise a subscription
to drain the marshes in the neighbourhood
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
of the city, and thus meliorate the air, which
is rendered extremely unwholsome in the
summer, by putrid exhalations from those
morasses? I demanded of them, why they
did not contribute their wealth, and exert
their political refinements, in augmenting
their forces by sea and land, for the defence of
their country, introducing commerce and
manufactures, and in giving some conse∣quence
to their state, which was no more
than a mite in the political scale of Europe?
I expressed a desire to know what became of
all those sums of money, inasmuch as there
was hardly any circulation of gold and silver
in Rome, and the very bankers, on whom
strangers have their credit, make interest to
pay their tradesmen's bills with paper notes
of the bank of Spirito Santo? And now I
am upon this subject, it may not be amiss to
observe that I was strangely misled by all the
books I consulted about the current coin of Italy.
In Tuscany, and the Ecclesiastical State, one
sees nothing but zequines in gold, and pieces
of two paoli, one paolo, and half a paolo,
in silver. Besides these, there is a copper coin
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
at Rome, called bajocco and mezzo bajocco.
Ten bajocchi make a scudo, which is an
imaginary piece: two scudi make a ze∣quine;
and a French loui'dore is worth
about two zequines.</P>
<P>Rome has nothing to fear from the catho∣lic
powers, who respect it with a superstitious
veneration as the metropolitan seat of their
religion: but the popes will do well to avoid
misunderstandings with the maritime protes∣tant
states, especially the English, who being
masters of the Mediterranean, and in posses∣sion
of Minorca, have it in their power at
all times, to land a body of troops within
four leagues of Rome, and to take the city,
without opposition. Rome is surrounded
with an old wall, but altogether incapable of
defence. Or if it was, the circuit of the
walls is so extensive, that it would require a
garrison of twenty thousand men. The only
appearance of a fortification in this city, is
the castle of St. Angelo, situated on the fur∣ther
bank of the Tyber, to which there is
access by a handsome bridge: but this castle,
which was formerly the <HI>moles Adriani,</HI> could
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
not hold out half a day against a battery of
ten pieces of cannon properly directed. It
was an expedient left to the invention of the
modern Romans, to convert an ancient tomb
into a citadel. It could only serve as a tem∣porary
retreat for the pope in times of po∣pular
commotion, and on other sudden emer∣gencies;
as it happened in the case of pope
Clement VII. when the troops of the emperor
took the city by assault; and this only, while
he resided at the Vatican, from whence there
is a covered gallery continued to the castle:
it can never serve this purpose again, while
the pontiff lives on Monte Cavallo, which is
at the other end of the city. The castle of
St. Angelo, howsoever ridiculous as a fortress,
appears respectable as a noble monument of
antiquity, and though standing in a low
situation, is one of the first objects that strike
the eye of a stranger approaching Rome.
On the opposite side of the river, are the
wretched remains of the Mausoleum Augusti,
which was still more magnificent. Part of
the walls is standing, and the terraces are
converted into garden-ground. In viewing
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
these ruins, I remembered Virgil's pathetic
description of Marcellus, who was here in∣tombed.
<Q><L>Quantos ille virum, magnum mavortis ad urbem.</L>
<L>Campus aget gemitus, vel que Tyberine, videbis</L>
<L>Funera, cum tumulum preter labere recentem.</L></Q>
The beautiful poem of Ovid <HI>de Consolatione
ad Liviam,</HI> written after the ashes of Au∣gustus
and his nephew Marcellus, of Ger∣manicus,
Agrippa, and Drusus, were de∣posited
in this mausoleum, concludes with
these lines, which are extremely tender:

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I gave you my opinion freely
of the modern palaces of Italy. I shall
now hazard my thoughts upon the gardens
of this country, which the inhabitants extol
with all the hyperboles of admiration and ap∣plause.
I must acknowledge however, I have
not seen the famous villas at Frascati and
Tivoli, which are celebrated for their gardens
and water-works. I intended to visit these
places; but was prevented by an unexpected
change of weather, which deterred me from
going to the country. On the last day of
September the mountains of Palestrina were
covered with snow; and the air became so
cold at Rome, that I was forced to put on my
winter cloaths. This objection continued, till
I found it necessary to set out on my return
to Florence. But I have seen the gardens of
the <HI>Poggio Imperiale,</HI> and the <HI>Palazzo de Pitt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
at Florence, and those of the Vatican, of the
pope's palace on Monte Cavallo, of the Villa
Ludovisia, Medicea, and Pinciana, at Rome;
so that I think I have some right to judge of
the Italian taste in gardening. Among those
I have mentioned, that of the Villa Pinciana,
is the most remarkable, and the most exten∣sive,
including a space of three miles in cir∣cuit,
hard by the walls of Rome, containing
a variety of situations high and low, which
favour all the natural embellishments one
would expect to meet with in a garden, and
exhibit a diversity of noble views of the city
and adjacent country.</P>
<P>In a fine extensive garden or park, an
Englishman expects to see a number of groves
and glades, intermixed with an agreeable ne∣gligence,
which seems to be the effect of na∣ture
and accident. He looks for shady walks
encrusted with gravel; for open lawns covered
with verdure as smooth as velvet, but much
more lively and agreeable; for ponds, canals,
basins, cascades, and running streams of wa∣ter;
for clumps of trees, woods, and wilder∣nesses,
cut into delightful alleys, perfumed
with honey-suckle and sweet-briar, and re∣sounding
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
with the mingled melody of all the
singing birds of heaven: he looks for plats
of flowers in different parts to refresh the
sense, and please the fancy; for arbours,
grottos, hermitages, temples, and alcoves, to
shelter him from the sun, and afford him
means of contemplation and repose; and he
expects to find the hedges, groves, and walks,
and lawns kept with the utmost order and
propriety. He who loves the beauties of
simple nature, and the charms of neatness,
will seek for them in vain amidst the groves
of Italy. In the garden of the Villa Pinciana,
there is a plantation of four hundred pines,
or rather firs, which the Italians view with
rapture and admiration: there is likewise a
long walk, of trees extending from the garden∣gate
to the palace; and plenty of shade, with
alleys and hedges in different parts of the
ground: but the groves are neglected; the
walks are laid with nothing but common
mould or sand, black and dusty; the hedges
are tall, thin and shabby; the trees stunted;
the open ground, brown and parched, has
scarce any appearance of verdure. The flat,
regular alleys of evergreens are cut into
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
fantastic figures; the flower gardens embel∣lished
with thin cyphers and flourished figures
in box, while the flowers grow in rows of
earthen-pots, and the ground appears as
dusky as if it was covered with the cinders
of a blacksmith's forge. The water, of which
there is great plenty, instead of being col∣lected
in large pieces, or conveyed in little
rivulets and streams to refresh the thirsty soil,
or managed so as to form agreeable cascades,
is squirted from fountains in different parts
of the garden, through tubes little bigger
than common glyster-pipes. It must be
owned indeed that the fountains have their
merit in the way of sculpture and architec∣ture;
and that here is a great number of
statues which merit attention: but they serve
only to encumber the ground, and destroy that
effect of rural simplicity, which our gardens
are designed to produce. In a word, here we
see a variety of walks and groves and foun∣tains,
a wood of four hundred pines, a pad∣dock
with a few meagre deer, a flower-gar∣den,
an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aviary, a grotto, and a fish-pond;
and in spite of all these particulars, it is, in
my opinion, a very contemptible garden,
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
when compared to that of Stowe in Bucking∣hamshire,
or even to those of Kensington and
Richmond. The Italians understand, be∣cause
they study, the excellencies of art; but
they have no idea of the beauties of nature.
This Villa Pinciana, which belongs to the
Borghese family, would make a complete
academy for painting and sculpture, especi∣ally
for the study of antient marbles; for,
exclusive of the statues and busts in the gar∣den,
and the vast collection in the different
apartments, almost the whole outside of the
house is covered with curious pieces in basso
and alto relievo. The most masterly is that
of Curtius on horseback, leaping into the
gulph or opening of the earth, which is said
to have closed on receiving this sacrifice.
Among the exhibitions of art within the
house, I was much struck with a Bacchus,
and the death of Meleager, represented on
an antient sepulchre. There is also an ad∣mirable
statue of Silenus, with the infant
Bacchus in his arms; a most beautiful gla∣diator;
a curious Moor of black marble,
with a shirt of white alabaster; a finely pro∣portioned
bull of black marble also, standing
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
upon a table of alabaster; a black gipsey
with a head, hands, and feet of brass; and
the famous hermaphrodite, which vies with
that of Florence: though the most curious
circumstance of this article, is the mattrass
executed and placed by Bernini, with such art
and dexterity, that to the view, it rivals the
softness of wool, and seems to retain the
marks of pressure, according to the figure of
the superincumbent statue. Let us likewise
own, for the honour of the moderns, that
the same artist has produced two fine statues,
which we find among the ornaments of this
villa, namely, a David with his sling in the
attitude of throwing the stone at the giant
Goliah; and a Daphne changing into laurel
at the approach of Apollo. On the base of
this figure, are the two following elegant
lines, written by pope Urban VIII. in his
younger years.
<Q><L>Quisquis amans sequitur fugitiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> gaudia formoe,</L>
<L>Fronde manus implet, baccas vel carpit amaras.</L></Q>
I ought not to forget two exquisite antique
statues of Venus, the weeping slave, and the
youth pulling a thorn out of his foot.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
I do not pretend to give a methodical de∣tail
of the curiosities of Rome: they have
been already described by different authors,
who were much better qualified than I am
for the task: but you shall have what ob∣servations
I made on the most remarkable
objects, without method, just as they occur
to my remembrance; and I protest the re∣marks
are all my own: so that if they de∣serve
any commendation, I claim all the
merit; and if they are impertinent, I must
be contented to bear all the blame.</P>
<P>The piazza of St. Peter's church is altoge∣ther
sublime. The double colonnade on each
side extending in a semi-circular sweep, the
stupendous AEgyptian obelisk, the two foun∣tains,
the portico, and the admirable façade of
the church, form such an assemblage of mag∣nificent
objects, as cannot fail to impress the
mind with awe and admiration: but the
church would have produced a still greater
effect, had it been detached entirely from the
buildings of the Vatican. It would then
have been a master-piece of architecture,
complete in all its parts, intire and perfect:
whereas, at present, it is no more than a beau∣tiful
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
member attached to a vast undigested
and irregular pile of building. As to the
architecture of this famous temple, I shall
say nothing; neither do I pretend to describe
the internal ornaments. The great picture
of Mosaic work, and that of St. Peter's
bark tossed by the tempest, which appear
over the gate of the church, though rude in
comparison with modern pieces, are never∣theless
great curiosities, when considered as
the work of Giotto, who flourished in the
beginning of the fourteenth century. His
master was Cimabue, who learned painting
and architecture of the Grecian artists, who
came from Constantinople, and first revived
these arts in Italy. But, to return to St. Pe∣ter's,
I was not at all pleased with the famous
statue of the dead Christ in his mother's lap,
by Michael Angelo. The figure of Christ is
as much emaciated, as if he had died of a
consumption: besides, there is something in∣delicate,
not to say indecent, in the attitude
and design of a man's body, stark naked,
lying upon the knees of a woman. Here are
some good pictures, I should rather say copies
of good pictures, done in Mosaic to great per∣fection;
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
particularly a St. Sebastian by Dome∣nichino,
and Michael the Archangel, from a
painting of Guido Rheni. I am extremely
fond of all this artist's pieces. There is a
tenderness and delicacy in his manner; and
his figures are all exquisitely beautiful, though
his expression is often erroneous, and his atti∣tudes
are always affected and unnatural. In
this very piece the archangel has all the air of
a French dancing-master; and I have seen a
Madonna by the same hand, I think it is in
the Palazzo di Barberini, in which, though
the figures are enchanting, the Virgin is re∣presented
holding up the drapery of the In∣fant,
with the ridiculous affectation of a
singer on the stage of our Italian opera.
The Mosaic work, though brought to a
wonderful degree of improvement, and ad∣mirably
calculated for churches, the damp∣ness
of which is pernicious to the colours of
the pallet, I will not yet compare to the pro∣ductions
of the pencil. The glassyness (if I
may be allowed the expression) of the sur∣face,
throws, in my opinion, a false light on
some parts of the picture; and when you ap∣proach
it, the joinings of the pieces look like
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
so many cracks on painted canvas. Besides,
this method is extremely tedious and expen∣sive.
I went to see the artists at work, in a
house that stands near the church, where I
was much pleased with the ingenuity of the
process; and not a little surprized at the great
number of different colours and tints, which
are kept in separate draws, marked with num∣bers
as far as seventeen thousand. For a single
head done in Mosaic, they asked me fifty
zequines. But to return to the church. The
altar of St. Peter's choir, notwithstanding all
the ornaments which have been lavished upon
it, is no more than a heap of puerile finery,
better adapted to an Indian pagod, than to a
temple built upon the principles of the Greek
architecture. The four colossal figures that
support the chair, are both clumsy and dis∣proportioned.
The drapery of statues, whe∣ther
in brass or stone, when thrown into
large masses, appears hard and unpleasant to
the eye; and for that reason the antients al∣ways
imitated wet linen, which exhibiting the
shape of the limbs underneath, and hanging
in a multiplicity of wet folds, gives an air of
lightness, softness, and ductility to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122"/>
These two statues weigh 116257 pounds,
and as they sustain nothing but a chair, are
out of all proportion, inasmuch as the sup∣porters
ought to be suitable to the things sup∣ported.
Here are four giants holding up the
old wooden chair of the apostle Peter, if
we may believe the book <HI>De Identitate Cathe∣drae
Romanae.</HI> The implements of popish
superstition; such as relicks of pretended
saints, ill proportioned spires and bellfreys,
and the nauseous repetition of the figure of
the cross, which is in itself a very mean and
disagreeable object, only fit for the prisons of
condemned criminals, have contributed to
introduce a vitious taste into the external ar∣chitecture,
as well as in the internal orna∣ments
of our temples. All churches are
built in the figure of a cross, which effectu∣ally
prevents the eye from taking in the scope
of the building, either without side or with∣in;
consequently robs the edifice of its pro∣per
effect. The palace of the Escurial in
Spain is laid out in the shape of a gridiron,
because the convent was built in consequence
of a vow to St. Laurence, who was broiled
to death like a barbecued pig. What pity it
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
is, that the labours of painting should have
been so much employed on the shocking sub∣jects
of the martyrology. Besides number∣less
pictures of the flagellation, crucifixion,
and descent from the cross, we have Judith
with the head of Holofernes, Herodias with
the head of John the Baptist, Jael assassinat∣ing
Sisera in his sleep, Peter writhing on the
cross, Stephen battered with stones, Sebastian
stuck full of arrows, Laurence frying upon
the coals, Bartholomew fleaed alive, and a
hundred other pictures equally frightful,
which can only serve to fill the mind with
gloomy ideas, and encourage a spirit of reli∣gious
fanaticism, which has always been at∣tended
with mischievous consequences to the
community where it reigned.</P>
<P>The tribune of the great altar, consisting
of four wreathed brass pillars, gilt, sup∣porting
a canopy, is doubtless very magnifi∣cent,
if not over-charged with sculpture,
fluting, foliage, festoons, and figures of boys
and angels, which, with the hundred and
twenty-two lamps of silver, continually burn∣ing
below, serve rather to dazzle the eyes, and
kindle the devotion of the ignorant vulgar,
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
than to excite the admiration of a judicious
observer.</P>
<P>There is nothing, I believe, in this famous
structure, so worthy of applause, as the ad∣mirable
symmetry and proportion of its parts.
Notwithstanding all the carving, gilding, basso
relievos, medallions, urns, statues, columns,
and pictures with which it abounds, it does
not, on the whole, appear over-crouded with
ornaments. When you first enter, your eye
is filled so equally and regularly, that nothing
appears stupendous; and the church seems
considerably smaller than it really is. The
statues of children, that support the founts of
holy water when observed from the door,
seem to be of the natural size; but as you
draw near, you perceive they are gigantic.
In the same manner, the figures of the doves,
with olive branches in their beaks, which are
represented on the wall, appear to be within
your reach; but as you approach them, they
recede to a considerable height, as if they had
flown upwards to avoid being taken.</P>
<P>I was much disappointed at sight of the
Pantheon, which, after all that has been said
of it, looks like a huge cockpit, open at top.
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
The portico which Agrippa added to the
building, is undoubtedly very noble, though,
in my opinion, it corresponds but ill with the
simplicity of the edifice. With all my venera∣tion
for the antients, I cannot see in what the
beauty of the rotunda consists. It is no more
than a plain unpierced cylinder, or circular
wall, with two fillets and a cornice, having a
vaulted roof or cupola, open in the centre.
I mean the original building, without consi∣dering
the vestibule of Agrippa. Within side
it has much the air of a mausoleum. It was
this appearance which, in all probability, sug∣gested
the thought to Boniface IV. to transport
hither eight and twenty cart-loads of old rot∣ten
bones, dug from different burying-places,
and then dedicate it as a church to the blessed
Virgin and all the holy martyrs. I am not
one of those who think it is well lighted by
the hole at the top, which is about nine and
twenty feet in diameter, although the author
of the Grand Tour calls it but nine. The
fame author says, there is a descent of eleven
steps to go into it; that it is a hundred and
forty-four feet in heighth, and as many in
breadth; that it was covered with copper,
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
which, with the brass nails of the portico,
pope Urban VIII. took away, and converted
into the four wreathed pillars that support
the canopy of the high altar in the church
of St. Peter, &amp;c. The truth is, before the
time of pope Alexander VII. the earth was
so raised as to cover part of the temple, and
there was a descent of some steps into
the porch: but that pontiff ordered the
ground to be pared away to the very pedestal
or base of the portico, which is now even
with the street, so that there is no descent
whatsoever. The height is two hundred
palmi, and the breadth two hundred and
eighteen; which, reckoning the palmi at
nine inches, will bring the height to one
hundred and fifty, and the breadth to one
hundred and sixty-three feet six inches. It
was not any covering of copper which pope
Urban VIII. removed, but large brass beams,
which supported the roof of the portico.
They weighed 186392 pounds; and afforded
metal enough not only for the pillars in St.
Peter's church, but also for several pieces of
artillery. What is more extraordinary, the
gilding of those columns is said to have cost
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
forty thousand golden crowns: sure money
was never worse laid out. Urban VIII. like∣wise
added two bellfrey towers to the rotunda;
and I wonder he did not cover the central hole
with glass, as it must be very inconvenient and
disagreeable to those who go to church below,
to be exposed to the rain in wet weather,
which must also render it very damp and un∣wholesome.
I visited it several times, and
each time it looked more and more gloomy
and sepulchral.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the Romans was not
so conspicuous in their temples, as in their
theatres, amphitheatres, circusses, naumachia,
aqueducts, triumphal arches, porticoes, basi∣licae,
but especially their thermae, or bathing-places.
A great number of their temples
were small and inconsiderable; not one of
them was comparable either for size or mag∣nificence,
to the modern church of St. Peter
of the Vatican. The famous temple of Jupi∣ter
Capitolinus was neither half so long, nor
half so broad: it was but two hundred feet in
length, and one hundred and eighty-five in
breadth; whereas the length of St. Peter's
extends to six hundred and thirty-eight feet,
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
and the breadth to above five hundred. It is
very near twice as large as the temple of Ju∣piter
Olympius in Greece, which was counted
one of the seven wonders of the world. But
I shall take another opportunity to explain
myself further on the antiquities of this
city; a subject, upon which I am disposed
to be (perhaps impertinently) circumstantial.
When I begin to run riot, you should check
me with the freedom of a friend. The most
distant hint will be sufficient to,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>March 10, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Colossaeum or amphitheatre built
by Flavius Vespasian, is the most stu∣pendous
work of the kind which antiquity
can produce. Near one half of the external
circuit still remains, consisting of four tire of
arcades, adorned with columns of four or∣ders,
Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite.
The height and extent of it may be guessed
from the number of spectators it contained,
amounting to one hundred thousand; and yet,
according to Fontana's mensuration, it could
not contain above thirty-four thousand per∣sons
fitting, allowing a foot and an half for
each person: for the circuit of the whole
building did not exceed one thousand five hun∣dred
and sixty feet. The amphitheatre at
Verona is one thousand two hundred and
ninety feet in circumference; and that of
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
Nismes, one thousand and eighty. The Co∣lossaeum
was built by Vespasian, who employed
thirty thousand Jewish slaves in the work;
but finished and dedicated by his son Titus,
who, on the first day of its being opened, pro∣duced
fifty thousand wild beasts, which were
all killed in the arena. The Romans were
undoubtedly a barbarous people, who de∣lighted
in horrible spectacles. They viewed
with pleasure the dead bodies of criminals
dragged through the streets, or thrown down
the Scalae Gemoniae and Tarpeian rock, for
their contemplation. Their rostra were gene∣rally
adorned with the heads of some remark∣able
citizens, like Temple-Bar, at London.
They even bore the sight of Tully's head
fixed upon that very rostrum where he had
so often ravished their ears with all the charms
of eloquence, in pleading the cause of inno∣cence
and public virtue. They took delight
in seeing their fellow-creatures torn in pieces
by wild beasts, in the amphitheatre. They
shouted with applause when they saw a poor
dwarf or slave killed by his adversary; but
their transports were altogether extravagant,
when the devoted captives were obliged to
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
fight in troops, till one side was entirely
butchered by the other. Nero produced four
hundred senators, and six hundred of the
equestrian order, as gladiators in the public
arena: even the women fought with wild
beasts, as well as with each other, and
drenched the amphitheatres with their blood.
Tacitus says, “<HI>Sed faeminarum illustrium,
senatorumque filiorum plures per arenam faedati
sunt.</HI>” The execrable custom of sacrificing
captives or slaves at the tombs of their masters
and great men, which is still preserved among
the negroes of Africa, obtained also among
the antients, Greeks as well as Romans. I
could never, without horror and indignation,
read that passage in the twenty-third book of
the Iliad, which describes twelve valiant Tro∣jan
captives sacrificed by the inhuman Achilles
at the tomb of his friend Patroclus.
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
It is not at all clear to me, that a people is
the more brave, the more they are accustomed
to bloodshed in their public entertainments.
True bravery is not savage but humane.
<PB N="301" REF="132"/>
Some of this sanguinary spirit is inherited by
the inhabitants of a certain island that shall
be nameless—but, mum for that. You will
naturally suppose that the Coliseo was ruined
by the barbarians who sacked the city of
Rome: in effect, they robbed it of its orna∣ments
and valuable materials; but it was re∣served
for the Goths and Vandals of modern
Rome, to dismantle the edifice, and reduce it
to its present ruinous condition. One part of
it was demolished by pope Paul II. that he
might employ the stones of it in building the
palace of St. Mark. It was afterwards di∣lapidated
for the same purposes, by the car∣dinals
Riarius and Farnese, which last assumed
the tiara under the name of Paul III. Not∣withstanding
these injuries, there is enough
standing to convey a very sublime idea of
antient magnificence.</P>
<P>The Circi and Naumachia, if considered
as buildings and artificial basins, are admira∣ble;
but if examined as areae intended for
horse and chariot-races, and artificial seas for
exhibiting naval engagements, they seem to
prove that the antient Romans were but in∣differently
skilled and exercised either in horse∣manship
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
or naval armaments. The inclo∣sure
of the emperor Caracalla's circus is still
standing, and scarce affords breathing room
for an English hunter. The Circus Maximus,
by far the largest in Rome, was not so long as
the Mall; and I will venture to affirm, that
St. James's Park would make a much more
ample and convenient scene for those diver∣sions.
I imagine an old Roman would be very
much surprised to see an English race on the
course at New-Market. The Circus Maximus
was but three hundred yards in breadth. A
good part of this was taken up by the spina,
or middle space, adorned with temples, sta∣tues,
and two great obelisks; as well as by the
euripus, or canal, made by order of Julius
Caesar, to contain crocodiles, and other aqua∣tic
animals, which were killed occasionally.
This was so large, that Heliogabalus, having
filled it with excellent wine, exhibited naval
engagements in it, for the amusement of the
people. It surrounded three sides of the
square, so that the whole extent of the race
did not much exceed an English mile; and
when Probus was at the expence of filling the
plain of it with fir-trees to form a wood for
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
the chace of wild beasts, I question much if
this forest was more extensive than the plan∣tation
in St. James's Park, on the south side
of the canal: now I leave you to judge what
ridicule a king of England would incur by
converting this part of the park into a chace
for any species of animals which are counted
game in our country.</P>
<P>The Roman emperors seemed more dis∣posed
to elevate and surprize, than to con∣duct
the public diversions according to the
rules of reason and propriety. One would
imagine, it was with this view they instituted
their naumachia, or naval engagements, per∣formed
by half a dozen small gallies of a
side in an artificial basin of fresh water.
These gallies I suppose were not so large as
common fishing-smacks, for they were moved
by two, three, and four oars of a side, ac∣cording
to their different rates, biremes, tri∣remes,
and quadriremes. I know this is a
knotty point not yet determined; and that
some antiquarians believe the Roman gallies
had different tires or decks of oars; but this
is a notion very ill supported, and quite con∣trary
to all the figures of them that are pre∣served
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
on antient coins and medals. Sueto∣nius
in the reign of Domitian, speaking of
these naumachia, says, “<HI>Edidit navales
pugnas, pene justarum classium, effosso, et cir∣cumducto
juxta Tyberim Lacu, atque inter maxi∣mas
imbres prospectavit.</HI>” This artificial lake
was not larger than the piece of water in
Hyde-Park; and yet the historian says, it
was almost large enough for real or intire
fleets. How would it sound in the ears of a
British sailor, an advertisement that a mock
engagement between two squadrons of men
of war would be exhibited on such a day in
the Serpentine river? or that the ships of the
line taken from the enemy would be carried
in procession from Hyde-Park-Corner to
Tower-wharf? Certain it is, Lucullus, in one
of his triumphs, had one hundred and ten
ships of war <HI>(naves longas)</HI> carried through
the streets of Rome. Nothing can give a
more contemptible idea of their naval power,
than this testimony of their historians, who
declare that their seamen or mariners were
formed by exercising small row-boats in an
inclosed-pool of fresh water. Had they not
the sea within a few miles of them, and the
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
river Tyber running through their capital!
even this would have been much more proper
for exercising their watermen, then a pond of
still-water, not much larger than a cold-bath.
I do believe in my conscience that half a dozen
English frigates would have been able to de∣feat
both the contending fleets at the famous
battle of Actium, which has been so much
celebrated in the annals of antiquity, as an
event that decided the fate of empire.</P>
<P>It would employ me a whole month to de∣scribe
the thermae or baths, the vast ruins of
which are still to be seen within the walls of
Rome, like the remains of so many separate
citadels. The thermae Dioclesianae might be
termed an august academy for the use and in∣struction
of the Roman people. The pinaco∣theca
of this building was a complete mu∣saeum
of all the curiosities of art and na∣ture;
and there were public schools for all
the sciences. If I may judge by my eye,
however, the thermae Antonianae built by
Caracalla, were still more extensive and mag∣nificent;
they contained cells sufficient for
two thousand three hundred persons to bathe
at one time, without being seen by one ano∣ther.
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
They were adorned with all the charms
of painting, architecture, and sculpture. The
pipes for conveying the water were of silver.
Many of the lavacra were of precious mar∣ble,
illuminated by lamps of chrystal. A∣mong
the statues, were found the famous
Toro, and Hercole Farnese.</P>
<P>Bathing was certainly necessary to health
and cleanliness in a hot country like Italy,
especially before the use of linen was known:
but these purposes would have been much
better answered by plunging into the Tyber,
than by using the warm bath in the thermae,
which became altogether a point of luxury
borrowed from the effeminate Asiatics, and
tended to debilitate the fibres already too
much relaxed by the heat of the climate.
True it is, they had baths of cool water for
the summer: but in general they used it milk∣warm,
and often perfumed: they likewise
indulged in vapour-baths, in order to enjoy
a pleasing relaxation, which they likewise
improved with odoriferous ointments. The
thermae consisted of a great variety of parts
and conveniences; the natationes, or swim∣ming
places; the portici, where people a∣mused
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
themselves in walking, conversing, and
disputing together, as Cicero says, <HI>In portici∣bus
deambulantes disputabant;</HI> the basilicae,
where the bathers assembled, before they en∣tered,
and after they came out of the bath;
the atria, or ample courts, adorned with noble
colonnades of Numidian marble and orien∣tal
granite; the ephibia, where the young
men inured themselves to wrestling and o∣ther
exercises; the frigidaria, or places kept
cool by a constant draught of air, promoted
by the disposition and number of the win∣dows;
the calidaria, where the water was
warmed for the baths; the platanones, or
delightful groves of sycamore; the stadia,
for the performances of the athletae; the
exedrae, or resting-places, provided with seats
for those that were weary; the palestrae, where
every one chose that exercise which pleased
him best; the gymnasia, where poets, ora∣tors,
and philosophers recited their works,
and harangued for diversion; the eleotesia,
where the fragrant oils and ointments were
kept for the use of the bathers; and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onisteria, where the wrestlers were smeared
with sand before they engaged. Of the
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
thermae in Rome, some were mercenary, and
some opened gratis. Marcus Agrippa, when
he was edile, opened one hundred and seventy
private baths, for the use of the people. In
the public baths, where money was taken,
each person paid a quadrans, about the value
of our halfpenny, as Juvenal observes,
<Q>“Caedere Sylvano porcum, quadrante lavari.”</Q>
But after the hour of bathing was past, it
sometimes cost a great deal more, according
to Martial,
<Q><L>“Balnca post decimam, lesso centumque petuntur</L>
<L>Quadrantes—”</L></Q></P>
<P>Though there was no distinction in the
places, between the first patrician and the
lowest plebeian, yet the nobility used their
own silver and gold plate, for washing, eating,
and drinking in the bath, together with towels
of the finest linen. They likewise made use
of the instrument called strigil, which was
a kind of flesh-brush; a custom to which Per∣sius
alludes in this line,
<Q>“I puer, et strigiles Crispini ad balnea de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.”</Q>
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
The common people contented themselves with
sponges. The bathing time was from noon till
the evening, when the Romans ate their prin∣cipal
meal. Notice was given by a bell, or
some such instrument, when the baths were
opened, as we learn from Juvenal,
<Q><L>“Redde Pilam, sonat AEs thermarum, ludere pergis?</L>
<L>Virgine vis sola lotus abire domum.”</L></Q>
There were separate places for the two sexes;
and indeed there were baths opened for
the use of women only, at the expence of
Agrippina, the mother of Nero, and some
other matrons of the first quality. The use
of bathing was become so habitual to the
constitutions of the Romans, that Galen, in
his book <HI>De Sanilate tuenda,</HI> mentions a cer∣tain
philosopher, who, if he intermitted but
one day in his bathing, was certainly attacked
with a fever. In order to preserve decorum
in the baths, a set of laws and regulations
were published, and the thermae were put
under the inspection of a censor, who was
generally one of the first senators in Rome.
Agrippa left his gardens and baths, which
stood near the pantheon, to the Roman peo∣ple:
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
among the statues that adorned them
was that of a youth naked, as going into the
bath, so elegantly formed by the hand of
Lysippus, that Tiberius, being struck with
the beauty of it, ordered it to be transferred
into his own palace: but the populace raised
such a clamour against him, that he was fain
to have it reconveyed to its former place.
These noble baths were restored by Adrian,
as we read in Spartian; but at present no
part of them remains.</P>
<P>With respect to the present state of the old
aqueducts, I can give you very little satisfac∣tion.
I only saw the ruins of that which
conveyed the aqua Claudia, near the Porta
Maggiore, and the Piazza of the Lateran.
You know there were fourteen of those an∣tient
aqueducts, some of which brought wa∣ter
to Rome from the distance of forty miles.
The channels of them were large enough to
admit a man armed on horseback; and there∣fore
when Rome was besieged by the Goths,
who had cut off the water, Belisarius forti∣fied
them with works to prevent the enemy
from entering the city by those conveyances.
After that period, I suppose the antient aque∣ducts
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
continued dry, and were suffered to
run to ruins. Without all doubt, the Ro∣mans
were greatly obliged to those benefac∣tors,
who raised such stupendous works for
the benefit, as well as the embellishment of
their city: but it might have been supplied
with the same water through pipes at one
hundredth part of the expence; and in that
case the enemy would not have found it such
an easy matter to cut it off. Those popes who
have provided the modern city so plentifully
with excellent water, are much to be com∣mended
for the care and expence they have
bestowed in restoring the streams called acqua
Virgine, acqua Felici, and acqua Paolina,
which affords such abundance of water as
would plentifully supply a much larger city
than modern Rome.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that M. Agrippa, the son-in-law,
friend, and favourite of Augustus,
should at the same time have been the idol
of the people, considering how surprisingly
he exerted himself for the emolument, con∣venience,
and pleasure of his fellow-citizens.
It was he who first conducted this aqua Vir∣gine
to Rome: he formed seven hundred re∣servoirs
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
in the city; erected one hundred and
five fountains; one hundred and thirty
<HI>castella,</HI> or conduits, which works he adorned
with three hundred statues, and four hundred
pillars of marble, in the space of one year.
He also brought into Rome, the aqua Julia,
and restored the aqueduct of the aqua Mar∣zia,
which had fallen to decay. I have al∣ready
observed the great number of baths
which he opened for the people, and the
magnificent thermae, with spacious gardens,
which he bequeathed to them as a legacy.
But these benefactions, great and munificent
as they seem to be, were not the most im∣portant
services he performed for the city of
Rome. The common-fewers were first made
by order of Tarquinius Priscus, not so much
with a view to cleanliness, as by way of sub∣terranean
drains to the Vilabrum, which was
marshy, and in order to carry off the stag∣nant
water, which remained in the lower
parts, after heavy rains. The different branches
of these channels united at the Forum, from
whence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the cloaca Maxima, their con∣tents
were conveyed into the Tyber. This
great cloaca was the work of Tarquinius
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
Superbus. Other sewers were added by
Marcus Cato, and Valerius Flaccus, the cen∣sors.
All these drains having been choaked
up and ruinous, were cleared and restored by
Marcus Agrippa, who likewise undermined
the whole city with canals of the same kind,
for carrying off the filth; he strengthened
and enlarged the cloaca maxima, so as to
make it capable of receiving a large cart
loaded with hay; and directed seven streams
of water into these subterranean passages, in
order to keep them always clean and open.
If, notwithstanding all these conveniences,
Vespasian was put to great expence in re∣moving
the ordure from the public streets, we
have certainly a right to conclude that the
antient Romans were not more cleanly than
the modern Italians.</P>
<P>After the mausolea of Augustus, and Adri∣an,
which I have already mentioned, the most
remarkable antient sepulchres at Rome, are
those of Caius Cestius, and Cecilia Metella.
The first, which stands by the Porta di S.
Paolo, is a beautiful pyramid, one hundred
and twenty feet high, still preserved intire,
having a vaulted chamber within-side, adorned
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
with some ancient painting, which is now
almost effaced. The building is of brick, but
cased with marble. This Caius Cestius had
been consul, was very rich, and acted as one
of the seven <HI>Epulones,</HI> who superintended the
feasts of the gods, called <HI>Lectisternia,</HI> and
<HI>Pervigilia.</HI> He bequeathed his whole for∣tune
to his friend M. Agrippa, who was so
generous as to give it up to the relations of
the testator. The monument of Cecilia Me∣tella,
commonly called <HI>Capo d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bove,</HI> is with∣out
the walls on the Via Appia. This lady
was daughter of Metellus Creticus, and wife
to Crassus, who erected this noble monument
to her memory. It consisted of two orders,
or stories, the first of which was a square of
hewn stone: the second was a circular tower▪
having a cornice, adorned with ox heads in
basso relievo, a circumstance from which it
takes the name of <HI>Capo di Bove.</HI> The ox was
supposed to be a most grateful sacrifice to the
gods. Pliny, speaking of bulls and oxen, says,
<Q>“Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> victimae optimae et laudatissima deorum placatio.”</Q>
This tower was surmounted by a noble cu∣pola
or dome, enriched with all the orna∣ments
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
of architecture. The door of the
building was of brass; and within-side the
ashes of Cecilia were deposited in a fluted
marble u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, of curious workmanship, which
is still kept in the Palazzo Farnese. At pre∣sent
the surface of the ground is raised so
much as to cover the first order of the
edifice: what we see is no more than the
round tower, without the dome and its or∣naments;

remains near the top, facing the Via Appia.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must not imagine I saw one half
of the valuable pictures and statues of
Rome; there is such a vast number of both
in this capital, that I might have spent a
whole year in taking even a transient view of
them; and, after all, some of them would
have been overlooked. The most celebrated
pieces, however, I have seen; and therefore
my curiosity is satisfied. Perhaps, if I had
the nice discernment and delicate sensibility of
a true connoisseur, this superficial glimpse
would have served only to whet my appetite,
and to detain me the whole winter at Rome.
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
In my progress through the Vatican, I was
much pleased with the School of Athens, by
Raphael, a piece which hath suffered from
the dampness of the air. The four boys at∣tending
to the demonstration of a mathe∣matician
are admirably varied in the ex∣pression.
Mr. Webb's criticism on this artist
is certainly just. He was perhaps the best
ethic painter that ever the world produced.
No man ever expressed the sentiments so hap∣pily,
in visage, attitude, and gesture: but he
seems to have had too much phlegm to strike
off the grand passions, or reach the sublime
parts of painting. He has the serenity of
Virgil, but wants the fire of Homer. There
is nothing in his Parnassus which struck me,
but the ludicrous impropriety of Apollo's
playing upon a fiddle, for the entertainment
of the nine muses.</P>
<P>The Last Judgment, by Buonaroti, in the
chapel of Sixtus IV. produced to my eye the
same sort of confusion, that perplexes my ear
at a grand concert, consisting of a great va∣riety
of instruments: or rather, when a num∣ber
of people are talking all at once. I was
pleased with the strength of expression, ex∣hibited
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
in single figures, and separate groupes:
but, the whole together is a mere mob, with∣out
subordination, keeping, or repose. A
painter ought to avoid all subjects that re∣quire
a multiplicity of groupes and figures;
because it is not in the power of that art to
unite a great number in one point of view,
so as to maintain that dependence which they
ought to have upon one another. Michael
Angelo, with all his skill in anatomy, his
correctness of design, his grand composition,
his fire, and force of expression, seems to
have had very little idea of grace. One
would imagine he had chosen his kings, he∣roes,
cardinals, and prelates, from among the
<HI>facchini</HI> of Rome; that he really drew his
Jesus on the Cross, from the agonies of some
vulgar assassin expiring on the wheel; and
that the originals of his Bambini, with their
mothers, were literally found in a stable. In
the Sala Regia, from whence the Sistian cha∣pel
is detached, we see, among other exploits
of catholic heroes, a representation of the
massacre of the protestants in Paris, Tholouse,
and other parts of France, on the eve of St.
Bartholomew, thus described in the <HI>Deseri∣zione
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
di Roma,</HI> “Nella prima pittura, es∣prime
Georgio Vasari l' istoria del Coligni,
grand 'amiraglio di Francia, che come capo
de ribelli, e degl 'ugonotti, fu ucciso; e nell
'altra vicina, la strage fatta in Parigi, e nel
regno, de rebelli, e degl 'Ugonotti.” “In
the first picture, George Vasari represents the
history of Coligni, high admiral of France,
who was slain as head of the rebels and hue∣gonots;
and in another near it, the slaughter
that was made of the rebels and huegonots in
Paris and other parts of the kingdom.” Thus
the court of Rome hath employed their
artists to celebrate and perpetuate, as a me∣ritorious
action, the most perfidious, cruel,
and infamous massacre, that ever disgraced
the annals of any nation.</P>
<P>I need not mention the two equestrian
statues of Constantine the Great, and Char∣lemagne,
which stand at opposite ends of the
great portico of St. Peter's church; because
there is nothing in them which particularly
engaged my attention. The sleeping Cleopa∣tra,
as you enter the court of the Belvedere,
in the Vatican, is much admired; but I was
better pleased with the Apollo, which I take
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
to be the most beautiful statue that ever was
formed. The Nile, which lies in the open
court, surmounted with the little children, has
infinite merit; but is much damaged, and
altogether neglected. Whether it is the same
described in Pliny, as having been placed
by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace, I do
not know. The sixteen children playing
about it, denoted the swelling of the Nile,
which never rose above sixteen cubits. As
for the famous groupe of Laocoon, it sur∣passed
my expectation. It was not without
reason that Buonaroti called it a portentous
work; and Pliny has done it no more than
justice in saying it is the most excellent piece that
ever was cut in marble; and yet the famous
Fulvius Ursini is of opinion that this is not
the same statue which Pliny described. His
reasons, mentioned by Montfaucon, are these.
The statues described by Pliny were of one
stone; but these are not. Antonioli, the an∣tiquary,
has in his possession, pieces of Lao∣coon's
snakes, which were found in the
ground, where the baths of Titus actually
stood, agreeable to Pliny, who says these sta∣tues
were placed in the buildings of Titus.
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
Be that as it may, the work which we now
see does honour to antiquity. As you have
seen innumerable copies and casts of it, in
marble, plaister, copper, lead, drawings, and
prints, and read the description of it in
Keyslar, and twenty other books of travels,
I shall say nothing more on the subject; but
that neither they nor I, nor any other person,
could say too much in its praise. It is not
of one piece indeed. In that particular Pliny
himself might be mistaken. “<HI>Opus omnibus
et picturae, et statuariae artis praeponendum.
Ex uno lapide eum et Liberos draconumque mir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣biles
nexus de consilii sententia fecere summi ar∣tifices.</HI>”
Buonaroti discovered the joinings,
though they were so artfully concealed as to
be invisible. This amazing groupe is the
work of three Rhodian sculptors, called
Agesander, Polydore, and Athenodorus, and
was found in the thermae of Titus Ves∣pasian,
still supposing it to be the true an∣tique.
As for the <HI>torso,</HI> or mutilated trunk
of a statue, which is called the School of
Michael Angelo, I had not time to consider
it attentively; nor taste enough to perceive
its beauties at first sight. The famous horses
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
on Monte Cavallo, before the pope's palace,
which are said to have been made in emula∣tion,
by Phidias and Praxiteles, I have seen,
and likewise those in the front of the Capitol,
with the statues of Castor and Pollux; but
what pleased me infinitely more than all of
them together, is the equestrian statue of Co∣rinthian
brass, standing in the middle of this
Piazza (I mean at the Capitol) said to repre∣sent
the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Others
suppose it was intended for Lucius Verus; a
third set of antiquaries contend for Lucius
Septimius Severus; and a fourth, for Con∣stantine,
because it stood in the Piazza of the
Lateran palace, built by that emperor, from
whence pope Paul III. caused it to be re∣moved
to the Capitol. I considered the tro∣phy
of Marius as a very curious piece of
sculpture, and admired the two sphinges at
the bottom of the stairs leading to this Piazza,
as the only good representations of life I had
ever seen from AEgypt: for the two idols of
that country, which stand in the ground∣floor
of the Musaeum of the Capitol, and in∣deed
all the AEgyptian statues in the Camera
AEgyptiaca of this very building, are such
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
monstrous misrepresentations of nature, that
they never could have obtained a place among
the statues of Rome, except as curiosities of
foreign superstition, or on account of the ma∣terials,
as they are generally of basaltes, por∣phyry,
or oriental granite.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the court of this
Musaeum, fronting the entrance, is a hand∣some
fountain, with the statue of a river-god
reclining on his urn; this is no other than
the famous Marforio, so called from its
having been found in Martis Foro. It is
remarkable only as being the conveyance of
the answers to the satires which are found
pasted upon Pasquin, another mutilated sta∣tue,
standing at the corner of a street.</P>
<P>The marble coffin, supposed to have con∣tained
the ashes of Alexander Severus, which
we find in one of these apartments, is a cu∣rious
antique, valuable for its sculpture in
basso relievo, especially for the figures on the
cover, representing that emperor and his mo∣ther
Julia Mammea.</P>
<P>I was sorry I had not time to consider the
antient plan of Rome, disposed in six classes,
on the stair-case of this Musaeum, which was
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
brought hither from a temple that stood in
the Forum Boarium, now called Campo
Vaccino.</P>
<P>It would be ridiculous in me to enter into
a detail of the vast collection of marbles,
basso relievos, inscriptions, urns, busts, and
statues, which are placed in the upper apart∣ments
of this edifice. I saw them but once,
and then I was struck with the following
particulars. A bacchanalian drunk; a Jupiter
and Leda, at least equal to that in the gal∣lery
at Florence; an old <HI>praefica,</HI> or hired
mourner, very much resembling those wrink∣led
hags still employed in Ireland, and in
the Highlands of Scotland, to sing the <HI>coro∣nach</HI>
at funerals, in praise of the deceased;
the famous Antinous, an elegant figure,
which Pousin studied as the canon or rule of
symmetry; the two fauns; and above all the
<HI>mirmillone,</HI> or dying gladiator; the attitude
of the body, the expression of the counte∣nance,
the elegance of the limbs, and the
swelling of the muscles, in this statue, are
universally admired; but the execution of
the back is incredibly delicate. The course
of the muscles called <HI>longissimi dorsi,</HI> are so
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
naturally marked and tenderly executed, that
the marble actually emulates the softness of
flesh; and you may count all the spines of the
vertebrae, raising up the skin as in the living
body; yet this statue, with all its merit, seems
inferior to the celebrated dying gladiator of
Ctesilas, as described by Pliny, who says the ex∣pression
of it was such, as appears altogether in∣credible.
In the court, on the opposite side of the
Capitol, there is an admirable statue of a lion
devouring an horse, which was found by the
gate of Ostia, near the pyramid of Caius
Cestius; and here on the left hand, under a
colonade, is what they call the Columna
Rostrata, erected in honour of Caius Duilius,
who first triumphed over the Carthaginians
by sea. But this is a modern pillar, with
the old inscription, which is so defaced as not
to be legible. Among the pictures in the
gallery and saloon above, what pleased me
most was the Bacchus and Ariadne of Guido
Rheni; and the wolf suckling Romulus and
Remus, by Rubens. The court of the Pa∣lazzo
Farnese is surrounded with antique
statues, among which the most celebrated
are, the Flora, with a most delicate drapery;
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
the gladiator, with a dead boy over his
shoulder; the Hercules, with the spoils of
the Nemean lion; but that which the con∣noisseurs
justly esteem above all the rest is
the Hercules, by Glycon, which you know as
well as I do, by the great reputation it has
acquired. This admirable statue having been
found without the legs, these were supplied
by Gulielmo de la Porta so happily, that
when afterwards the original limbs were dis∣covered,
Michael Angelo preferred the mo∣dern
ones, both in grace and proportion; and
they have been retained accordingly. In a
little house, or shed, behind the court, is
preserved the wonderful groupe of Dirce,
commonly called the Toro Farnese, which
was brought hither from the thermae Cara∣callae.
There is such spirit, ferocity, and
indignant resistance expressed in the bull, to
whose horns Dirce is tied by the hair, that I
have never seen any thing like it, either upon
canvass, or in stone. The statues of the two
brothers endeavouring to throw him into the
sea are beautiful figures, finely contrasted;
and the rope, which one of them holds in a
sort of loose coil, is so surprisingly chizzelled,
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
that one can hardly believe it is of stone.
As for Dirce herself, she seems to be but a
subaltern character; but there is a dog upon
his hind legs barking at the bull, which is
much admired. This amazing groupe was
cut out of one stone, by Appollonius and
Tauriscus, two sculptors of Rhodes; and is
mentioned by Pliny in the thirty-sixth book
of his Natural History. All the precious
monuments of art, which have come down to
us from antiquity, are the productions of
Greek artists. The Romans had taste enough
to admire the arts of Greece, as plainly ap∣pears
by the great collections they made of
their statues and pictures, as well as by
adopting their achitecture and musick: but
I do not remember to have read of any Ro∣man
who made a great figure either as a
painter or a statuary. It is not enough to
say those professions were not honourable in
Rome, because painting, sculpture, and mu∣sick,
even rhetoric, physic, and philosophy,
were practised and taught by slaves. The arts
were always honoured and revered at Rome,
even when the professors of them happened
to be slaves by the accidents and iniquity of
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
fortune. The business of painting and sta∣tuary
was so profitable, that in a free re∣public,
like that of Rome, they must have
been greedily embraced by a great number
of individuals: but, in all probability, the
Roman soil produced no extraordinary ge∣nius
for those arts. Like the English of this
day, they made a figure in poetry, history,
and ethics; but the excellence of painting,
sculpture, architecture, and music, they never
could attain. In the Palazzo Picchini, I saw
three beautiful figures, the celebrated statues
of Meleager, the boar, and dog; together
with a wolf, of excellent workmanship. The
celebrated statue of Moses, by Michael Angelo,
in the church of St. Peter in Vincula, I be∣held
with pleasure; as well as that of Christ,
by the same hand, in the church of S. Ma∣ria
sopra Minerva. The right foot, covered
with bronze, gilt, is much kissed by the de∣votees.
I suppose it is looked upon as a
specific for the tooth-ache; for, I saw a cava∣lier,
in years, and an old woman successively
rub their gums upon it, with the appearance
of the most painful perseverance.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>
You need not doubt but that I went to
the church of St. Peter in Montorio, to view
the celebrated transfiguration, by Raphael,
which, if it was mine, I would cut in two
parts. The three figures in the air attract
the eye so strongly, that little or no attention
is payed to those below on the mountain.
I apprehend that the nature of the subject
does not admit of that keeping and de∣pendence,
which ought to be maintained in
the disposition of the lights and shadows in
a picture. The groupes seem to be intirely
independent of each other. The extraordi∣nary
merit of this piece, I imagine, consists,
not only in the expression of divinity on the
face of Christ; but also in the surprising
lightness of the figure, that hovers like a
beautiful exhalation in the air. In the
church of St. Luke, I was not at all struck by
the picture of that saint, drawing the portrait
of the Virgin Mary, although it is admired as
one of the best pieces of Raphael. Indeed it
made so little impression upon me, that I do
not even remember the disposition of the
figures. The altar-piece, by Andrea Sacchi,
in the church of St Romauldus, would have
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
more merit, if the figure of the saint himself
had more consequence, and was represented
in a stronger light. In the Palazzo Borghese,
I chiefly admired the following pieces: a
Venus with two nymphs; and another with
Cupid, both by Titian: an excellent Roman
Piety, by Leonardo da Vinci; and the cele∣brated
Muse, by Dominechino, which is a fine,
jolly, buxom figure. At the palace of Co∣lonna
Connestabile, I was charmed with the
Herodias, by Guido Rheni; a young Christ;
and a Madonna, by Raphael; and four land-schapes,
two by Claude Lorraine, and the
other two, by Salvator Rosa. In the <HI>palazetto,</HI>
or summer-house belonging to the Palazzo
Rospigliosi, I had the satisfaction of contem∣plating
the Aurora of Guido, the colours of
which still remain in high perfection, not∣withstanding
the common report that the
piece is spoiled by the dampness of the apart∣ment.
The print of this picture, by Freij,
with all its merit, conveys but an imperfect
idea of the beauty of the original. In the Pa∣lazzo
Barberini, there is a great collection of
marbles and pictures: among the first, I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
attracted by a beautiful statue of Venus;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
sleeping faun, of curious workmanship; a
charming Bacchus, lying on an antient sculp∣ture,
and the famous Narcissus. Of the
pictures, what gave me most pleasure was
the Magdalen of Guido, infinitely superior
to that by Le Brun in the church of the
Carmelites at Paris; the Virgin, by Titian;
a Madonna, by Raphael, but not comparable
to that which is in the Palazzo de Pitti, at
Florence; and the death of Germanicus, by
Poussin, which I take to be one of the best
pieces in this great collection. In the Palazzo
Falconeri, there is a beautiful St. Cecilia, by
Guercino; a holy family, by Raphael; and
a fine expressive figure of St. Peter weeping,
by Dominechino. In the Palazzo Altieri, I
admired a picture, by Carlo Maratti, repre∣senting
a saint calling down lightning from
heaven to destroy blasphemers. It was the
figure of the saint I admired, merely as a
portrait. The execution of the other parts
was tame enough: perhaps they were pur∣posely
kept down, in order to preserve the
importance of the principal figure. I ima∣gine
Salvator Rosa would have made a dif∣ferent
disposition on the same subject: that
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
amidst the darkness of a tempest, he would
have illuminated the blasphemer with the
flash of lightning by which he was destroyed:
this would have thrown a dismal gleam upon
his countenance, distorted by the horror of
his situation as well as by the effects of the
fire; and rendered the whole scene dread∣fully
picturesque. In the same palace, I saw
the famous holy family, by Corregio, which
he left unfinished, and no other artist would
undertake to supply; for what reason I know
not. Here too is a judgment of Paris, by
Titian, which is reckoned a very valuable
piece. In the Palazzo Odescalchi, there is a
holy family, by Buonaroti, and another by
Raphael, both counted excellent, though in
very different stiles, extremely characteristic
of those two great rival artists.</P>
<P>If I was silly enough to make a parade, I
might mention some hundreds more of mar∣bles
and pictures, which I really saw at
Rome; and even eke out that number with
a huge list of those I did not see: but, what∣ever
vanity I may have, it has not taken this
turn; and I assure you, upon my word and
honour, I have described nothing but what
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
actually fell under my own observation. As

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have nothing to communicate touching
the library of the Vatican, which, with
respect to the apartments and their ornaments,
is undoubtedly magnificent. The number of
books it contains does not exceed forty thou∣sand
volumes, which are all concealed from
the view, and locked up in presses: as for
the manuscripts, I saw none but such as are
commonly presented to strangers of our na∣tion;
some very old copies of Virgil and
Terence; two or three Missals, curiously illu∣minated;
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
the book DeSeptem Sacramentis
written in Latin by Henry VIII. against
Luther; and some of that prince's love let∣ters
to Anne Boleyn. I likewise visited the
Libreria Casanatense, belonging to the convent
of the church called S. Maria Sopra Minerva.
I had a recommendation to the principal li∣brarian,
a Dominican friar, who received me
very politely, and regaled me with a sight of
several curious MSS. of the classics.</P>
<P>Having satisfied my curiosity at Rome, I
prepared for my departure, and as the road
between Radicofani and Montefiascone is
very stony and disagreeable, I asked the banker
Barazzi, if there was not a better way of re∣turning
to Florence, expressing a desire at the
same time to see the cascade of Terni. He
assured me that the road by Terni was forty
miles shorter than the other, much more safe
and easy, and accommodated with exceeding
good auberges. Had I taken the trouble to
cast my eyes upon the map, I must have seen,
that the road by Terni, instead of being forty
miles shorter, was much longer than the
other: but this was not the only mistake
of Signiore Barazzi. Great part of this way
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
lies over steep mountains, or along the side
of precipices, which render travelling in a
carriage exceeding tedious, dreadful, and dan∣gerous;
and as for the public houses, they
are in all respects the most execrable that
ever I entered. I will venture to say that a
common prisoner in the Marshalsea or King's∣Bench
is more cleanly and commodiously
lodged than we were in many places on this
road. The houses are abominably nasty, and
generally destitute of provision: when eata∣bles
were found, we were almost poisoned by
their cookery: their beds were without cur∣tains
or bedstead, and their windows without
glass; and for this sort of entertainment we
payed as much as if we had been genteelly
lodged, and sumptuously treated. I repeat it
again; of all the people I ever knew, the
Italians are the most villainously rapacious.
The first day, having passed Civita Castellana,
a small town standing on the top of a hill,
we put up at what was called an excellent
inn, where cardinals, prelates, and princes,
often lodged. Being meagre day, there was
nothing but bread, eggs, and anchovies, in
the house. I went to bed without supper,
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
and lay in a pallet, where I was half devoured
by vermin. Next day, our road, in some
places, lay along precipices, which over-hang
the Nera or Nar, celebrated in antiquity for
its white foam, and the sulphureous quality
of its waters.
<Q>Sulfureâ nar albus aquã, fontesque velini.</Q>
It is a small, but rapid stream, which runs
not far from hence, into the Tyber. Passing
Utricoli, near the ruins of the ancient Ocri∣coli,
and the romantic town of Narni, si∣tuated
on the top of a mountain, in the
neighbourhood of which is still seen standing
one arch of the stupendous bridge built by
Augustus Caesar, we arrived at Terni, and
hiring a couple of chaises before dinner, went
to see the famous Cascata delle Marmore,
which is at the distance of three miles. We
ascended a steep mountain by a narrow road
formed for a considerable way along the
brink of a precipice, at the bottom of which
brawls the furious river Nera, after having
received the Velino. This last is the stream
which, running from the Lago delle Marmore,
forms the cascade by falling over a precipice
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
about one hundred and sixty feet high. Such
a body of water rushing down the moun∣tain;
the smoak, vapour, and thick white
mist which it raises; the double rainbow
which these particles continually exhibit while
the sun shines; the deafening sound of the
cataract; the vicinity of a great number of
other stupendous rocks and precipices, with
the dashing, boiling, and foaming of the two
rivers below, produce altogether an object of
tremendous sublimity: yet great part of its
effect is lost, for want of a proper point of
view, from which it might be contemplated.
The cascade would appear much more asto∣nishing,
were it not in some measure eclipsed
by the superior height of the neighbouring
mountains. You have not a front perspec∣tive;
but are obliged to view it obliquely on
one side, standing upon the brink of a preci∣pice,
which cannot be approached without
horror. This station might be rendered
much more accessible, and altogether secure,
for the expence of four or five zequines;
and a small tax might be levied for the pur∣pose
from travellers by the aubergiste at Terni,
who lets his calasses for half a zequine a
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
piece to those that are curious to see this
phaenomenon. Besides the two postilions
whom I payed for this excursion, at the rate
of one stage in posting, there was a fellow
who posted himself behind one of the chaises,
by way of going to point out the different
views of the cascade; and his demand a∣mounted
to four or five pauls. To give you
an idea of the extortion of those villainous
publicans, I must tell you that for a dinner
and supper, which even hunger could not
tempt us to eat, and a night's lodging in
three truckle beds, I paid eighty pauls, a∣mounting
to forty shillings sterling. You
ask me why I submitted to such imposition?
I will tell you—I have more than once in
my travels made a formal complaint of the
exorbitancy of a publican, to the magistrate
of the place; but I never received any sa∣tisfaction,
and have lost abundance of time.
Had I proceeded to manual correction, I
should have alarmed and terrified the wo∣men▪
had I peremptorily refused to pay the
sum total, the landlord, who was the post∣master,
would not have supplied me with
horses to proceed on my journey. I tried the
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
experiment at Muy in France, where I put
myself into a violent passion, had abundance
of trouble, was detained till it was almost
night, and after all found myself obliged to
submit, furnishing at the same time matter
of infinite triumph to the mob, which had
surrounded the coach, and interested them∣selves
warmly in favour of their townsman.
If some young patriot, in good health and
spirits, would take the trouble as often as he
is imposed upon by the road in travelling, to
have recourse to the fountain-head, and pre∣fer
a regular complaint to the comptroller of
the posts, either in France or Italy, he would
have ample satisfaction, and do great service
to the community. Terni is an agreeable
town, pretty well built, and situated in a
pleasant valley, between two branches of the
river Nera, whence it was called by the an∣tients,
Interamna. Here is an agreeable
piazza, where stands a church that was of
old a heathen temple. There are some va∣luable
paintings in the church. The people
are said to be very civil, and provisions to
be extremely cheap. It was the birth-place
of the emperor Tacitus, as well as of the
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
historian of the same name. In our
journey from hence to Spoleto, we passed
over a high mountain, (I think it is called
Somna,) where it was necessary to have
two additional horses to the carriage, and
the road winds along a precipice, which
is equally dangerous and dreadful. We
passed through part of Spoleto, the capital
of Umbria, which is a pretty large city. Of
this, however, I can give no other account
from my own observation, but that I saw at
a distance the famous Gothic aqueduct or
brick: this is mentioned by Addison as a
structure, which, for the height of its arches,
is not equalled by any thing in Europe. The
road from hence to Foligno, where we lay,
is kept in good order, and lies through a
delightful plain, laid out into beautiful inclo∣sures,
abounding with wine, oil, corn, and
cattle, and watered by the pastoral streams
of the famous river Clitumnus, which takes
its rise in three or four separate rivulets issu∣ing
from a rock near the highway. On the
right-hand, we saw several towns situated on
rising grounds, and among the rest, that
of Assisio, famous for the birth of St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Francis, whose body, being here deposited,
occasions a great concourse of pilgrims.
We met a Roman princess going thither
with a grand retinue, in consequence of
a vow she had made for the re-establish∣ment
of her health. Foligno, the Ful∣ginium
of the antients, is a small town,
not unpleasant, lying in the midst of mul∣berry
plantations, vineyards, and corn-fields,
and built on both sides of the little river
Topino. In choosing our beds at the inn,
I perceived one chamber locked, and desired it
might be opened; upon which the cameriere
declared with some reluctance, <HI>“Besogna
dire a su' eccellenza; poco fa, che una bestia e
morta in questa camera, e non e ancora lustrata.”</HI>
When I enquired what beast it was, he re∣plied,
<HI>“Un' eretico Inglese.”</HI> I suppose he
would not have made so free with our coun∣try
and religion, if he had not taken us for
German catholics, as we afterwards learned
from Mr. R—i. Next day, we crossed the
Tyber, over a handsome bridge, and in
mounting the steep hill upon which the city
of Perugia stands, our horses being exhausted,
were dragged backwards by the weight of the
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
carriage to the very edge of a precipice, where,
happily for us, a man passing that way, placed
a large stone behind one of the wheels, which
stopped their motion, otherwise we should
have been all dashed in pieces. We had
another ugly hill to ascend within the city,
which was more difficult and dangerous than
the other: but the postillions and the other
beasts made such efforts, that we mounted
without the least stop, to the summit, where
we found ourselves in a large piazza, where
the horses are always changed. There being
no relays at the post, we were obliged to stay
the whole day and night at Perugia, which
is a considerable city, built upon the acclivity
of a hill, adorned with some elegant foun∣tains,
and several handsome churches, con∣taining
some valuable pictures by Guido,
Raphael, and his master Pietro Perugino,
who was a native of this place. The next
stage is on the banks of the lake, which was
the Thrasimene of the antients, a beautiful
piece of water, above thirty miles in circum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence,
having three islands, abounding with
excellent fish: upon a peninsula of it, there
is a town and castle. It was in this neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
where the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Flaminius was
totally defeated with great slaughter by Hanni∣bal.
From Perugia to Florence, the posts
are all double, and the road is so bad that
we never could travel above eight and twenty
miles a day. We were often obliged to quit
the carriage, and walk up steep mountains;
and the way in general was so unequal and
stony, that we were jolted even to the dan∣ger
of our lives. I never felt any sort of
exercise or fatigue so intolerable; and I did
not fail to bestow an hundred benedictions
per diem upon the banker Barazzi, by whose
advice we had taken this road; yet there was
no remedy but patience. If the coach had
not been incredibly strong, it must have been
shattered to pieces. The fifth night we
passed at a place called Camoccia, a miserable
cabaret, where we were fain to cook our own
supper, and lay in a musty chamber, which
had never known a fire, and indeed had no
fire-place, and where we ran the risque of
being devoured by rats. Next day one of
the irons of the coach gave way at Arezzo,
where we were detained two hours before it
could be accommodated. I might have taken
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
this opportunity to view the remains of the
antient Etruscan amphitheatre, and the tem∣ple
of Hercules, described by the cavalier
Lorenzo Guazzesi, as standing in the neigh∣bourhood
of this place: but the blacksmith
assured me his work would be finished in a
few minutes; and as I had nothing so much
at heart as the speedy accomplishment of this
disagreeable journey, I chose to suppress my
curiosity, rather than be the occasion of a
moment's delay. But all the nights we had
hitherto passed were comfortable in compari∣son
to this, which we suffered at a small
village, the name of which I do not remem∣ber.
The house was dismal and dirty be∣yond
all description; the bed-cloaths filthy
enough to turn the stomach of a muleteer;
and the victuals cooked in such a manner,
that even a Hottentot could not have beheld
them without loathing. We had sheets of
our own, which were spread upon a mattrass,
and here I took my repose wrapped in a great-coat,
if that could be called repose which
was interrupted by the innumerable stings of
vermin. In the morning, I was seized with
a dangerous fit of the hooping-cough, which
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
terrified my wife, alarmed my people, and
brought the whole community into the house.
I had undergone just such another at Paris,
about a year before. This forenoon, one of
our coach wheels flew off in the neighbour∣hood
of Ancisa, a small town, where we were
detained above two hours by this accident;
a delay which was productive of much dis∣appointment,
danger, vexation, and fatigue.
There being no horses at the last post, we were
obliged to wait until those which brought us
thither should be sufficiently refreshed to pro∣ceed.
Understanding that all the gates of
Florence are shut at six, except two that
are kept open for the accommodation of
travellers; and that to reach the nearest of
these gates, it was necessary to pass the river
Arno in a ferry-boat, which could not trans∣port
the carriage; I determined to send my
servant before with a light chaise to enter the
nearest gate before it was shut, and provide
a coach to come and take us up at the side of
the river, where we should be obliged to pass
in the boat: for I could not bear the thoughts
of lying another night in a common cabaret.
Here, however, another difficulty occurred.
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
There was but one chaise, and a dragoon
officer, in the imperial troops, insisted upon
his having bespoke it for himself and his
servant. A long dispute ensued, which had
like to have produced a quarrel: but at
length I accommodated matters, by telling
the officer that he should have a place in it
gratis, and his servant might ride a-horse-back.
He accepted the offer without hesita∣tion;
but, in the mean time, we set out in
the coach before them, and having proceeded
about a couple of miles, the road was so
deep from a heavy rain, and the beasts were
so fatigued, that they could not proceed.
The postillions scourging the poor animals
with great barbarity, they made an effort, and
pulled the coach to the brink of a precipice,
or rather a kind of hollow-way, which might
be about seven or eight feet lower than the
road. Here my wife and I leaped out, and
stood under the rain up to the ancles in mud;
while the postillions still exercising their whips,
one of the fore-horses fairly tumbled down
the descent, and hung by the neck, so that
he was almost strangled before he could be
disengaged from the traces, by the assistance
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
of some foot travellers that happened to pass.
While we remained in this dilemma, the
chaise, with the officer and my servant, com∣ing
up, we exchanged places; my wife and
I proceeded in the chaise, and left them with
Miss C—and Mr. R—, to follow in
the coach. The road from hence to Florence
is nothing but a succession of steep moun∣tains,
paved and conducted in such a man∣ner,
that one would imagine the design had
been to render it impracticable by any sort
of wheel-carriage. Notwithstanding all our
endeavours, I found it would be impossible to
enter Florence before the gates were shut. I
flattered and threatened the driver by turns:
but the fellow, who had been remarkably
civil at first, grew sullen and impertinent.
He told me I must not think of reaching
Florence: that the boat would not take the
carriage on board; and that from the other
side, I must walk five miles before I should
reach the gate that was open: but he would
carry me to an excellent osteria, where I
should be entertained and lodged like a prince.
I was now convinced that he had lingered on
purpose to serve this inn-keeper; and I took
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
it for granted that what he told me of the
distance between the ferry and the gate was
a lie. It was eight o'clock when we arrived
at his inn. I asighted with my wife to view
the chambers, desiring he would not put up
his horses. Finding it was a villainous house,
we came forth, and, by this time, the horses
were put up. I asked the fellow how he
durst presume to contradict my orders, and
commanded him to put them to the chaise.
He asked in his turn if I was mad? If I
thought I and the lady had strength and courage
enough to walk five miles in the dark, through
a road which we did not know, and which was
broke up by a continued rain of two days?
I told him he was an impertinent rascal, and
as he still hesitated, I collared him with one
hand, and shook my cane over his head with
the other. It was the only weapon I had,
either offensive or defensive; for I had left
my sword, and musquetoon in the coach.
At length the fellow obeyed, though with
great reluctance, cracking many severe jokes
upon us in the mean time, and being joined
in his raillery by the inn-keeper, who had
all the external marks of a ruffian. The
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
house stood in a solitary situation, and not a
soul appeared but these two miscreants, so
that they might have murdered us without
fear of detection. “You do not like the
apartments? (said one) to be sure they were
not fitted up for persons of your rank and
quality!” “You will be glad of a worse
chamber, (continued the other) before you
get to bed.” “If you walk to Florence to
night, you will sleep so sound, that the fleas
will not disturb you.” “Take care you do
not take up your night's lodging in the middle
of the road, or in the ditch of the city-wall.”
I fired inwardly at these sarcasms, to which,
however, I made no reply; and my wife was
almost dead with fear. In the road from
hence to the boat, we met with an ill-look∣ing
fellow, who offered his service to conduct
us into the city, and such was our situation,
that I was fain to accept his proposal, especi∣ally
as we had two small boxes in the chaise
by accident, containing some caps and laces
belonging to my wife. I still hoped the po∣stilion
had exaggerated in the distance be∣tween
the boat and the city gate, and was
confirmed in this opinion by the ferryman,
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
who said we had not above half a league to
walk. Behold us then in this expedition;
myself wrapped up in a very heavy great-coat,
and my cane in my hand. I did not
imagine I could have walked a couple of miles
in this equipage, had my life been depending;
my wife a delicate creature, who had scarce
ever walked a mile in her life; and the raga∣muffin
before us with our boxes under his
arm. The night was dark and wet; the
road slippery and dirty; not a soul was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en,
nor a sound was heard: all was silent, dreary,
and horrible. I laid my account with a vio∣lent
fit of illness from the cold I should in∣fallibly
catch, if I escaped assassination, the
fears of which were the more troublesome as
I had no weapon to defend our lives. While
I laboured under the weight of my great∣coat,
which made the streams of sweat flow
down my face and shoulders, I was plung∣ing
in the mud, up to the mid-leg at every
step; and at the same time obliged to sup∣port
my wife, who wept in silence, half dead
with terror and fatigue. To crown our vexa∣tion,
our conductor walked so fast, that he
was often out of sight, and I imagined he had
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
run away with the boxes. All I could do,
on these occasions, was to hollow as loud as I
could, and swear horribly that I would blow
his brains out. I did not know but these
oaths and menaces might keep other rogues
in awe. In this manner did we travel four
long miles, making almost an intire circuit
of the city-wall, without seeing the face of
a human creature, and at length reached the
gate, where we were examined by the guard,
and allowed to pass, after they had told us it
was a long mile from thence to the house of
Vanini, where we proposed to lodge. No
matter, being now fairly within the city, I
plucked up my spirits, and performed the
rest of the journey with such ease, that I am
persuaded, I could have walked at the same
pace all night long, without being very much
fatigued. It was near ten at night, when we
entered the auberge in such a draggled and
miserable condition, that Mrs. Vanini almost
fainted at sight of us, on the supposition
that we had met with some terrible disaster,
and that the rest of the company were killed.
My wife and I were immediately accommo∣dated
with dry stockings and shoes, a warm
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
apartment, and a good supper, which I ate
with great satisfaction, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing not only from
our having happily survived the adventure,
but also from a conviction that my strength
and constitution were wonderfully repaired: not
but that I still expected a severe cold, attended
with a terrible sit of the asthma: but in this
I was luckily disappointed. I now for the
first time drank to the health of my physi∣cian
Barazzi, fully persuaded that the hard∣ships
and violent exercise I underwent by fol∣lowing
his advice, had greatly contributed to
the re-establishment of my health. In this
particular, I imitate the gratitude of Taver∣nier,
who was radically cured of the gout
by a Turkish aga in AEgypt, who gave him
the bastinado, because he would not look at
the head of the bashaw of Cairo, which the
aga carried in a bag, to be presented to the
grand signior at Constantinople.</P>
<P>I did not expect to see the rest of our
company that night, as I never doubted but
they would stay with the coach at the inn on
the other side of the Arno: but at mid-night
we were joined by Miss C—and Mr. R—,
who had left the carriage at the inn, under
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
the auspices of the captain and my servant,
and followed our foot-steps by walking from
the ferry-boat to Florence, conducted by one
of the boatmen. Mr. R—seemed to be
much ruffled and chagrined; but, as he did
not think proper to explain the cause, he had
no right to expect that I should give him sa∣tisfaction
for some insult he had received from
my servant. They had been exposed to a
variety of disagreeable adventures from the
impracticability of the road. The coach
had been several times in the most imminent
hazard of being lost with all our baggage;
and at two different places, it was necessary
to hire a dozen of oxen, and as many men,
to disengage it from the holes into which it
had run. It was in the confusion of these
adventures, that the captain and his valet,
Mr. R—and my servant, had like to have
gone all by the ears together. The peace
was with difficulty preserved by the interpo∣tion
of Miss C—, who s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered incredibly
from cold and wet, terror, vexation, and
fatigue: yet happily no bad consequence
ensued. The coach and baggage were brought
safely into Florence next morning, when all
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
of us found ourselves well refreshed, and in
good spirits. I am afraid this is not the case
with you, who must by this time be quite
jaded with this long epistle, which shall
therefore be closed without further cere∣mony

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>March 20, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE season being far advanced, and
the weather growing boisterous, I
made but a short stay at Florence, and set
out for Pisa, with full resolution to take the
nearest road to Lerici, where we proposed
to hire a felucca for Genoa. I had a great
desire to see Leghorn and Lucca; but the
dread of a winter's voyage by sea in an open
boat effectually restrained my curiosity. To
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
avoid the trouble of having our baggage
shifted every post, I hired two chaises to Pisa
for a couple of zequines, and there we ar∣rived
in safety about seven in the evening,
though not without fear of the consequence,
as the calesses were quite open, and it rained
all the way. I must own I was so sick of the
wretched accommodation one meets with in
every part of Italy, except the great cities,
so averse to the sea at this season, and so fond
of the city of Pisa, that I should certainly
have stayed here the winter, had not I been
separated from my books and papers, as well
as from other conveniencies and connexions
which I had at Nice; and foreseen that the
thoughts of performing the same disagreea∣ble
voyage in the spring would imbitter my
whole winter's enjoyment. I again hired
two calesses for Lerici, proposing to lie at
Sarzana, three miles short of that place,
where we were told we should find comforta∣ble
lodging, and to embark next day with∣out
halting. When we departed in the morn∣ing,
it rained very hard, and the Cerchio,
which the chaises had formerly passed, al∣most
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
without wetting the wheels, was now
swelled to a mighty river, broad and deep
and rapid. It was with great difficulty I
could persuade my wife to enter the boat;
for it blew a storm, and she had seen it
in coming over from the other side hurried
down a considerable way by the rapidity of
the current, notwistanding all the efforts of
the watermen. Near two hours were spent
in transporting us with our chaises. The
road between this and Spirto Santo was
rendered almost impassable. When we ar∣rived
at Massa, it began to grow dark, and
the post-master assured us that the road to
Sarzana was overflowed in such a manner
as not to be passed even in the day-time,
without imminent danger. We therefore
took up our lodging for the night at this
house, which was in all respects one of the
worst we had yet entered. Next day, we
found the Magra as large and violent as the
Cerchio: however, we passed it without any
accident, and in the afternoon arrived at
Lerici. There we were immediately besieged
by a number of patrons of seluccas, from
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
among whom I chose a Spaniard, partly
because he looked like an honest man, and
produced an ample certificate, signed by an
English gentleman; and partly, because he
was not an Italian; for, by this time, I had
imbibed a strong prejudice against the com∣mon
people of that country. We embarked
in the morning before day, with a gale that
made us run the lee-gunwale in the water;
but, when we pretended to turn the point of
Porto Venere, we found the wind full in our
teeth, and were obliged to return to our quar∣ters,
where we had been shamefully fleeced
by the landlord, who, nevertheless, was not
such an exorbitant knave as the post-master,
whose house I would advise all travellers to
avoid. Here, indeed, I had occasion to see
an instance of prudence and oeconomy, which
I should certainly imitate, if ever I had occa∣sion
to travel this way by myself. An English∣man,
who had hired a felucca from Antibes
to Leghorn, was put in here by stress of wea∣ther;
but being aware of the extortion of
inn-keepers, and the bad accommodation in
their houses, he slept on board on his own
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
mattrasses; and there likewise he had all his
conveniencies for eating. He sent his ser∣vant
on shore occasionally to buy provision,
and see it cooked according to his direction in
some public house; and had his meals regu∣larity
in the felucca. This evening he came
ashore to stretch his legs, and took a solitary
walk on the beach, avoiding us with great
care, although he knew we were English:
his valet, who was abundantly communica∣tive,
told my servant, that in coming through
France, his master had travelled three days
in company with two other English gentle∣men,
whom he met upon the road, and in
all that time he never spoke a word to either:
yet in other respects, he was a good man,
mild, charitable, and humane. This is a
character truly British. At five o'clock in
the morning we put to sea again, and though
the wind was contrary, made shift to reach
the town of Sestri di Levante, where we were
most graciously received by the publican
butcher and his family. The house was in
much better order than before; the people
were much more obliging; we passed a very
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
tolerable night, and had a very reasonable bill
to pay in the morning. I cannot account
for this favourable change any other way,
than by ascribing it to the effects of a ter∣rible
storm, which had two days before torn
up a great number of their olive-trees by
the roots, and done such damage as terri∣fied
them into humility and submission, Next
day, the water being delightful, we arrived
by one o'clock in the afternoon at Genoa.
Here I made another bargain with our pa∣tron
Antonio, to carry us to Nice. He had
been hitherto remarkably obliging, and seem∣ingly
modest. He spoke Latin fluently, and
was tinctured with the sciences. I began to
imagine he was a person of a good family,
who had met with misfortunes in life, and
respected him accordingly: but I found
him mercenary, mean, and rapacious. The
wind being still contrary, when we departed
from Genoa, we could get no further than
Finale, where we lodged in a very dismal
habitation, which was recommended to us as
the best auberge in the place. What ren∣dered
it the more uncomfortable, the night
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
was cold, and there was not a fire-place in
the house, except in the kitchen. The beds
(if they deserved that name) were so shock∣ingly
nasty, that we could not have used
them, had not a friend of Mr. R—sup∣plied
us with mattrasses, sheets, and cover∣lets;
for our own sheets were on board the
felucca, which was anchored at a distance
from the shore. Our fare was equally
wretched: the master of the house was a
surly assassin, and his cameriere or waiter,
stark-staring mad. Our situation was at
the same time shocking and ridiculous. Mr.
R—quarrelled over night with the master,
who swore in broken French to my man,
that he had a good mind to poinard that
impertinent Piedmontese. In the morning
before day, Mr. R—, coming into my cham∣ber,
gave me to understand that he had been
insulted by the landlord, who demanded six
and thirty livres for our supper and lodging.
Incensed at the rascal's presumption, I assured
him I would make him take half the money,
and a good beating into the bargain. He re∣plied,
that he would have saved me the trou∣ble
of beating him, had not the cameriere,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
who was a very sensible fellow, assured him
the patrone was out of his senses, and if
roughly handled, might commit some extra-vagance.
Though I was exceedingly ruffled,
I could not help laughing at the mad came∣riere's
palming himself upon, R—i, as a
sensible fellow, and transferring the charge of
madness upon his master, who seemed to be
much more knave than fool. While Mr.
R—went to mass, I desired the cameriere
to bid his master bring the bill, and to tell
him that if it was not reasonable, I would
carry him before the commandant. In the
mean time I armed myself with my sword
in one hand and my cane in the other. The
inn-keeper immediately entered, pale and
staring, and when I demanded his bill, he
told me, with a profound reverence, that he
should be satisfied with whatever I myself
thought proper to give. Surprised at this
moderation, I asked if he should be content
with twelve livres, and he answered, “Con∣tentissimo,”
with another prostration. Then
he made an apology for the bad accommoda∣tion
of his house, and complained, that the
reproaches of the other gentleman, whom he
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
was pleased to call my major-duomo, had al∣most
turned his brain. When he quitted the
room, his cameriere, laying hold of his
master's last words, pointed to his own fore∣head,
and said, he had informed the gentle∣man
over-night that his patron was mad.
This day we were by a high wind in the
afternoon, driven for shelter into Porto
Mauritio, where we found the post-house
even worse than that of Finale; and what
rendered it more shocking was a girl quite
covered with the confluent small-pox, who
lay in a room through which it was necessary
to pass to the other chambers, and who smell∣ed
so strong as to perfume the whole house.
We were but fifteen miles from St. Remo,
where I knew the auberge was tolerable, and
thither I resolved to travel by land. I accord∣ingly
ordered five mules to travel post, and
a very ridiculous cavalcade we formed, the
women being obliged to use common saddles;
for in this country even the ladies sit astride.
The road lay along one continued precipice,
and was so difficult, that the beasts never
could exceed a walking pace. In some places
we were obliged to alight. Seven hours were
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
spent in travelling fifteen short miles: at
length we arrived at our old lodgings in St.
Remo, which we found white-washed, and
in great order. We supped pretty comforta∣bly;
slept well; and had no reason to com∣plain
of imposition in paying the bill. This
was not the case in the article of the mules,
for which I was obliged to pay fifty livres,
according to the regulation of the posts.
The post-master, who came along with us,
had the effrontery to tell me, that if I had
hired the mules to carry me and my com∣pany
to St. Remo, in the way of common
travelling, they would have cost me but
fifteen livres; but as I demanded post-horses,
I must submit to the regulations.
This is a distinction the more absurd, as the
road is of such a nature as renders it impos∣sible
to travel faster in one way than in ano∣ther;
nor indeed is there the least difference
either in the carriage or convenience, be∣tween
travelling post and journey riding. A
publican might with the same reason charge
me three livres a pound for whiting, and if
questioned about the imposition, reply, that
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
if I had asked for fish I should have had the
very same whiting for the fifth part of the
money: but that he made a wide difference
between selling it as fish, and selling it as
whiting. Our felucca came round from Porto
Mauritio in the night, and embarking next
morning, we arrived at Nice about four in
the afternoon.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you a circumstantial
detail of my Italian expedition, during which
I was exposed to a great number of hard∣ships,
which I thought my weakened consti∣tution
could not have bore; as well as to
violent fits of passion, chequered, however,
with transports of a more agreeable nature;
insomuch that I may say I was for two
months continually agitated either in mind
or body, and very often in both at the same
time. As my disorder at first arose from a
sedentary life, producing a relaxation of the
fibres, which naturally brought on a listless∣ness,
indolence, and dejection of the spirits
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am convinced that this hard exercise of
mind and body, co-operated with the chang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of air and objects, to brace up the relaxe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
constitution, and promote a more vigorous
circulation of the juices, which had long
languished even almost to stagnation. For
some years, I had been as subject to colds as
a delicate woman new delivered. If I ven∣tured
to go abroad when there was the least
moisture either in the air, or upon the
ground, I was sure to be laid up a fortnight
with a cough and asthma. But, in this
journey, I suffered cold and rain, and stood,
and walked in the wet, heated myself with
exercise, and sweated violently, without feel∣ing
the least disorder; but, on the contrary,
felt myself growing stronger every day in
the midst of these excesses. Since my return
to Nice, it has rained the best part of two
months, to the astonishment of all the people
in the country; yet during all that time I
have enjoyed good health and spirits. On
Christmas-Eve, I went to the cathedral at
mid-night, to hear high mass celebrated by
the new bishop of Nice, in pontif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>calibus,
and stood near two hours uncovered in a cold
gallery, without having any cause in the sequel
to repent of my curiosity. In a word, I am
now so well that I no longer despair of seeing

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ask whether I think the French
people are more taxed than the English;
but I apprehend, the question would be more
apropos if you asked whether the French
taxes are more insupportable than the Eng∣lish;
for, in comparing burthens, we ought
always to consider the strength of the shoul∣ders
that bear them. I know no better way
of estimating the strength, than by examin∣ing
the face of the country, and observing
the appearance of the common people, who
constitute the bulk of every nation. When
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
I, therefore, see the country of England
smiling with cultivation; the grounds exhi∣biting
all the perfection of agriculture, par∣celled
out into beautiful inclosures, corn∣fields,
hay and pasture, woodland and com∣mon;
when I see her meadows well stocked
with black cattle; her downs covered with
sheep; when I view her teams of horses and
oxen, large and strong, fat and sleek; when
I see her farm-houses the habitations of plenty,
cleanliness, and convenience; and her pea∣sants
well fed, well lodged, well cloathed,
tall and stout, and hale and jolly; I cannot
help concluding that the people are well able
to bear those impositions which the public
necessities have rendered necessary. On the
other hand, when I perceive such signs of
poverty, misery, and dirt, among the com∣monalty
of France, their unfenced fields dug
up in despair, without the intervention of
meadow or fallow ground, without cattle to
furnish manure, without horses to execute
the plans of agriculture; their farm-houses
mean, their furniture wretched, their apparel
beggarly; themselves and their beasts the
images of famine; I cannot help thinking
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
they groan under oppression, either from their
landlords, or their government; probably
from both.</P>
<P>The principal impositions of the French
government are these: first, the taille, payed
by all the commons, except those that are
privileged: secondly, the capitation, from
which no persons, (not even the nobles) are
excepted: thirdly, the tenths and twentieths,
called Dixiêmes and Vingtiêmes, which every
body pays. This tax was originally levied as
an occasional aid in times of war, and other
emergencies; but by degrees is become a
standing revenue even in time of peace. All
the money arising from these impositions
goes directly to the king's treasury; and must
undoubtedly amount to a very great sum.
Besides these, he has the revenue of the
farms, consisting of the droits d'aydes, or
excise on wine, brandy, &amp;c. of the custom∣house
duties; of the gabelle, comprehending
that most oppressive obligation on individuals
to take a certain quantity of salt at the
price which the farmers shall please to fix;
of the exclusive privilege to sell tobacco; of
the droits de controlle, in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuation, centiême
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
denier, franchiefs, aubeine, echange et contre∣echange
arising from the acts of voluntary
jurisdiction, as well as certain law-suits.
These farms are said to bring into the king's
coffers above one hundred and twenty mil∣lions
of livres yearly, amounting to near
five millions sterling: but the poor people
are said to pay about a third more than this
sum, which the farmers retain to enrich
themselves, and bribe the great for their pro∣tection;
which protection of the great is
the true reason why this most iniquitous, op∣pressive,
and absurd method of levying mo∣ney
is not laid aside. Over and above those
articles I have mentioned, the French king
draws considerable sums from his clergy, un∣der
the denomination of dons gratuits, or
free-gifts; as well as from the subsidies given
by the pays d'etats, such as Provence, Lan∣guedoc,
and Bretagne, which are exempted
from the taille. The whole revenue of the
French king amounts to between twelve and
thirteen millions sterling. These are great
resources for the king: but they will always
keep the people miserable, and effectually
prevent them from making such improve∣ments
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
as might turn their lands to the best
advantage. But besides being eased in the
article of taxes, there is something else re∣quired
to make them exert themselves for the
benefit of their country. They must be free
in their persons, secure in their property, in∣dulged
with reasonable leases, and effectually
protected by law from the insolence and op∣pression
of their superiors.</P>
<P>Great as the French king's resources may
appear, they are hardly sufficient to defray
the enormous expence of his government.
About two millions sterling per annum of
his revenue are said to be anticipated for
paying the interest of the public debts; and
the rest is found inadequate to the charge of
a prodigious standing army, a double fron∣tier
of fortified towns, and the extravagant
appointments of ambassadors, generals, go∣vernors,
intendants, commandants, and other
officers of the crown, all of whom affect a
pomp, which is equally ridiculous and pro∣digal.
A French general in the field is al∣ways
attended by thirty or forty cooks; and
thinks it is incumbent upon him, for the
glory of France, to give a hundred dishes
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
every day at his table. When don Philip,
and the marechal duke de Belleisle, had their
quarters at Nice, there were fifty scullions
constantly employed in the great square in
plucking poultry. This absurd luxury infects
their whole army. Even the commissaries
keep open table; and nothing is seen but
prodigality arid profusion. The king of Sar∣dinia
proceeds upon another plan. His
troops are better cloathed, better payed, and
better fed than those of France. The com∣mandant
of Nice has about four hundred a
year of appointments, which enable him to
live decently, and even to entertain strangers.
On the other hand, the commandant of An∣tibes,
which is in all respects more inconsi∣derable
than Nice, has from the French king
above five times the sum to support the
glory of his monarch, which all the sensible
part of mankind treat with ridicule and con∣tempt.
But the finances of France are so
ill managed, that many of their command∣ants,
and other officers, have hot been able
to draw their appointments these two years.
In vain they complain and remonstrate.
When they grow troublesome they are re∣moved.
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
How then must they support the
glory of France? how, but by oppressing
the poor people. The treasurer makes use
of their money for his own benefit. The
king knows it; he knows his officers thus
defrauded, fleece and oppress his people:
but he thinks proper to wink at these
abuses. That government may be said
to be weak and tottering which finds itself
obliged to connive at such proceedings.
The king of France, in order to give strength
and stability to his administration, ought to
have sense to adopt a sage plan of oeconomy,
and vigour of mind sufficient to execute it in
all its parts, with the most rigorous exactness.
He ought to have courage enough to find
fault, and even to punish the delinquents, of
what quality soever they may be: and the first
act of reformation ought to be a total abo∣lition
of all the farms. There are, undoubt∣edly,
many marks of relaxation in the reins
of the French government, and, in all pro∣bability,
the subjects of France will be the
first to take advantage of it. There is at
present a violent fermentation of different
principles among them, which under the reign
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
of a very weak prince, or during a long mi∣nority,
may produce a great change in the
constitution. In proportion to the progress
of reason and philosophy, which have made
great advances in this kingdom, superstition
loses ground; antient prejudices give way;
a spirit of freedom takes the ascendant. All
the learned laity of France detest the hie∣rarchy
as a plan of despotism, founded on im∣posture
and usurpation. The protestants,
who are very numerous in the southern parts,
abhor it with all the rancour of religious
fanaticism. Many of the commons, en∣riched
by commerce and manufacture, grow
impatient of those odious distinctions, which
exclude them from the honours and privi∣leges
due to their importance in the com∣monwealth;
and all the parliaments, or
tribunals of justice in the kingdom, seem
bent upon asserting their rights and inde∣pendence
in the face of the king's prerogative,
and even at the expence of his power and
authority. Should any prince therefore be
seduced by evil counsellors, or misled by his
own bigotry, to take some arbitrary step, that
may be extremely disagreeable to all those
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
communities, without having spirit to exert
the violence of his power for the support of
his measures, he will become equally de∣tested
and despised; and the influence of the
commons will insensibly encroach upon the
pretensions of the crown. But if in the
time of a minority, the power of the go∣vernment
should be divided among different
competitors for the regency, the parliaments
and people will find it still more easy to ac∣quire
and ascertain the liberty at which they
aspire, because they will have the balance of
power in their hands, and be able to make
either scale preponderate. I could say a great
deal more upon this subject; and I have some
remarks to make relating to the methods
which might be taken in case of a fresh rup∣ture
with France, for making a vigorous im∣pression
on that kingdom. But these I must
defer till another occasion, having neither
room nor leisure at present to add any thing,
but that I am, with great truth,</P>

DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>AS I have now passed a second winter at
Nice I think myself qualified to make
some further remarks on this climate. Du∣ring
the heats of last summer, I flattered
myself with the prospect of the fine weather
I should enjoy in the winter; but neither I,
nor any person in this country, could foresee
the rainy weather that prevailed from the
middle of November, till the twentieth of
March. In this short period of four months,
we have had fifty-six days of rain, which I
take to be a greater quantity than generally
falls during the six worst months of the year
in the county of Middlesex, especially as it
was, for the most part, a heavy, continued
rain. The south winds generally predomi∣nate
in the wet season at Nice: but this
winter the rain was accompanied with every
wind that blows, except the south; though
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
the most frequent were those that came from
the east and north quarters. Notwithstand∣ing
these great rains, such as were never
known before at Nice in the memory of man,
the intermediate days of fair weather were
delightful, and the ground seemed perfectly
dry. The air itself was perfectly free from
moisture. Though I live upon a ground
floor, surrounded on three sides by a garden,
I could not perceive the least damp, either
on the floors, or the furniture; neither was
I much incommoded by the asthma, which used
always to harrass me most in wet weather. In
a word, I passed the winter here much more
comfortably than I expected. About the
vernal equinox, however, I caught a violent
cold, which was attended with a difficulty of
breathing, and as the sun advances towards
the tropic, I find myself still more subject to
rheums. As the heat increases, the humours
of the body are rarefied, and, of consequence,
the pores of the skin are opened; while the
east wind sweeping over the Alps and Ap∣penines,
covered with snow, continues sur∣prisingly
sharp and penetrating. Even the
people of the country, who enjoy good health,
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
are afraid of exposing themselves to the air
at this season, the intemperature of which
may last till the middle of May, when all
the snow on the mountains will probably
be melted: then the air will become mild
and balmy, till, in the progress of summer, it
grows disagreeably hot, and the strong eva∣poration
from the sea makes it so saline, as
to be unhealthy for those who have a scor∣butical
habit. When the sea-breeze is high,
this evaporation is so great as to cover the
surface of the body with a kind of volatile
brine, as I plainly perceived last summer. I
am more and more convinced that this cli∣mate
is unfavourable for the scurvy. Were
I obliged to pass my life in it, I would en∣deavour
to find a country retreat among the
mountains, at some distance from the sea,
where I might enjoy a cool air, free from this
impregnation, unmolested by those flies,
gnats, and other vermin, which render the
lower parts almost uninhabitable. To this
place I would retire in the month of June,
and there continue till the beginning of
October, when I would return to my habi∣tation
in Nice, where the winter is remark∣ably
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
mild and agreeable. In March and
April however, I would not advise a valetu∣dinarian
to go forth, without taking precau∣tion
against the cold. An agreeable summer
retreat may be found on the other side of the
Var, at, or near the town of Grasse, which is
Pleasantly situated on the ascent of a hill in
Provence, about seven English miles from
Nice. This place is famous for its pomatum,
gloves, wash-balls, perfumes, and toilette-boxes,
lined with bergamot. I am told it
affords good lodging, and is well supplied
with provisions.</P>
<P>We are now preparing for our journey to
England, from the exercise of which I pro∣mise
myself much benefit: a journey ex∣tremely
agreeable, not only on that account,
but also because it will restore me to the
company of my friends, and remove me
from a place where I leave nothing but
the air, which I can possibly regret. The
only friendship I have contracted at Nice
are with strangers, who, like myself, only
sojourn here for a season. I now find by
experience, it is great folly to buy furni∣ture,
unless one is resolved to settle here
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
for some years. The Nissards assured me,
with great confidence, that I should always
be able to sell it for a very little loss; whereas
I find myself obliged to part with it for
about one-third of what it cost. I have
sent for a coach to Aix, and as soon as
it arrives, shall take my departure; so
that the next letter you receive from me
will be dated at some place on the road.
I purpose to take Antibes, Toulon, Mar∣seilles,
Aix, Avignon, and Orange, in my
way: places which I have not yet seen;
and where, perhaps, I shall find something
for your amusement, which will always be
a consideration of some weight with,</P>

<OPENER>To Dr. S—at Nice.
<DATELINE>Turin, <DATE>March 18, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am just returned from an excursion to
Turin, which is about thirty leagues from
hence, the greater part of the way lying over
frightful mountains covered with snow. The
difficulty of the road, however, reaches no
farther than Coni, from whence there is an
open highway through a fine plain country,
as far as the capital of Piedmont, and the tra∣veller
is accommodated with chaise and horses
to proceed either post, or by cambiatura, as in
other parts of Italy. There are only two
ways of performing the journey over the
mountains from Nice; one is to ride a mule∣back,
and the other to be carried in a chair.
The former I chose, and set out with my
servant on the seventh day of February at
two in the afternoon. I was hardly clear of
Nice, when it began to rain so hard that in
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
less than an hour the mud was half a foot
deep in many parts of the road. This was
the only inconvenience we suffered, the way
being in other respects practicable enough;
for there is but one small hill to cross on this
side of the village of L'Escarene, where we
arrived about six in the evening. The ground
in this neighbourhood is tolerably cultivated,
and the mountains are planted to the tops
with olive trees. The accommodation here
is so very bad, that I had no inclination to
be a bed longer than was absolutely necessary
for refreshment; and therefore I proceeded on
my journey at two in the morning, con∣ducted
by a guide, whom I hired for this
purpose at the rate of three livres a day.
Having ascended one side, and descended the
other, of the mountain called Braus, which
took up four hours, though the road is not
bad, we at fix reached the village of Sospello,
which is agreeably situated in a small valley,
surrounded by prodigious high and barren
mountains. This little plain is pretty fertile,
and being watered by a pleasant stream,
forms a delightful contrast with the hideous
rocks that surround it. Having reposed my∣self
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
and my mules two hours at this place,
we continued our journey over the second
mountain, called Brovis, which is rather more
considerable than the first, and in four hours
arrived at La Giandola, a tolerable inn situ∣ated
betwixt the high road and a small ri∣ver,
about a gunshot from the town of
Brieglie, which we leave on the right. As
we jogged along in the grey of the morning,
I was a little startled at two figures which I saw
before me, and began to put my pistols in
order. It must be observed that these moun∣tains
are infested with <HI>contrabandiers,</HI> a set of
smuggling peasants, very bold and desperate,
who make a traffic of selling tobacco, salt,
and other merchandize, which have not payed
duty, and sometimes lay travellers under con∣tribution.
I did not doubt but there was a
gang of these free-booters at hand; but as
no more than two persons appeared, I re∣solved
to let them know we were prepared
for defence, and fired one of my pistols, in
hope that the report of it, echoed from the
surrounding rocks, would produce a proper
effect: but, the mountains and roads being
entirely covered with snow to a considerable
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
depth, there was little or no reverberation,
and the sound was not louder than that of a
pop-gun, although the piece contained a good
charge of powder. Nevertheless, it did not
fail to engage the attention of the strangers,
one of whom immediately wheeled to the left
about, and being by this time very near me,
gave me an opportunity of contemplating
his whole person. He was very tall, meagre,
and yellow, with a long hooked nose, and
small twinkling eyes. His head was cased in
a woollen night-cap, over which he wore a
flapped hat; he had a silk handkerchief a∣bout
his neck, and his mouth was furnished
with a short wooden pipe, from which he
discharged wreathing clouds of tobacco-smoke.
He was wrapped in a kind of capot of green
bays, lined with wolf-skin, had a pair of
monstrous boots, quilted on the inside with
cotton, was almost covered with dirt, and
rode a mule so low that his long legs hung
dangling within six inches of the ground.
This grotesque figure was so much more ludi∣crous
than terrible, that I could not help
laughing; when taking his pipe out of his
mouth, he very politely accosted me by name.
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
You may easily guess I was exceedingly sur∣prised
at such an address on the top of the
mountain Brovis: but he forthwith put an
end to it to, by discovering himself to be the
marquis M. whom I had the honour to be
acquainted with at Nice. After having ral∣lied
him upon his equipage, he gave me to
understand he had set out from Nice the
morning of the same day that I departed;
that he was going to Turin, and that he had
sent one of his servants before him to Coni
with his baggage. Knowing him to be an
agreeable companion, I was glad of this en∣counter,
and we resolved to travel the rest of
the way together. We dined atLa Giandola,
and in the afternoon rode along the little
river Roida, which runs in a bottom between
frightful precipices, and in several places
forms natural cascades, the noise of which
had well-nigh deprived us of the sense of
hearing; after a winding course among these
mountains, it discharges itself into the Medi∣terranean
at Vintimiglia, in the territory of
Genoa. As the snow did not lie on these
mountains, when we cracked our whips, there
was such a repercussion of the sound as is al∣together
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
inconceivable. We passed by the vil∣lage
of Saorgio, situated on an eminence,
where there is a small fortress which com∣mands
the whole pass, and in five hours ar∣rived
at our inn, on this side the Col de Tende,
where we took up our quarters, but had very
little reason to boast of our entertainment.
Our greatest difficulty, however, consisted in
pulling off the marquis's boots, which were
of the kind called Seafarot, by this time so
loaded with dirt on the outside, and so swelled
with the rain within, that he could neither
drag them after him as he walked, nor disen∣cumber
his legs of them, without such vio∣lence
as seemed almost sufficient to tear him
limb from limb. In a word, we were obliged
to tie a rope about his heel, and all the peo∣ple
in the house assisting to pull, the poor
marquis was drawn from one end of the a∣partment
to the other before the boot would
give way: at last his legs were happily dis∣engaged,
and the machines carefully dried
and stuffed for next day's journey.</P>
<P>We took our departure from hence at three
in the morning, and at four, began to mount
the Col de Tende, which is by far the highest
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
mountain in the whole journey: it was now
quite covered with snow, which at the top of
it was near twenty feet thick. Half way up,
there are quarters for a detachment of sol∣diers,
posted here to prevent smuggling, and
an inn called La Ca, which in the language
of the country signifies the house. At this
place, we hired six men to assist us in ascend∣ing
the mountain, each of them provided
with a kind of hough to break the ice, and
make a sort of steps for the mules. When
we were near the top, however, we were
obliged to alight, and climb the mountain
supported each by two of those men, called
Coulants, who walk upon the snow with
great firmness and security. We were fol∣lowed
by the mules, and though they are
very sure-footed animals, and were frost-shod
for the occasion, they stumbled and fell very
often; the ice being so hard that the sharp
headed nails in their shoes could not pene∣trate.
Having reached the top of this moun∣tain,
from whence there is no prospect but
of other rocks and mountains, we prepared
for descending on the other side by the Leze,
which is an occasional sledge made of two
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
pieces of wood, carried up by the Coulants
for this purpose. I did not much relish this
kind of carriage, especially as the mountain
was very steep, and covered with such a thick
fog that we could hardly see two or three
yards before us. Nevertheless, our guides
were so confident, and my companion, who
had passed the same way on other occasions,
was so secure, that I ventured to place myself
on this machine, one of the coulants stand∣ing
behind me, and the other sitting before,
as the conductor, with his feet paddling
among the snow, in order to moderate the ve∣locity
of its descent. Thus accommodated, we
descended the mountain with such rapidity,
that in an hour we reached Limon, which is
the native place of almost all the muleteers
who transport merchandize from Nice to Coni
and Turin. Here we waited full two hours
for the mules, which travelled with the ser∣vants
by the common road. To each of
the coulants we paid forty sols, which are
nearly equal to two shillings sterling. Leav∣ing
Limon, we were in two hours quite dis∣engaged
from the gorges of the mountains,
which are partly covered with wood and
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
pasturage, though altogether inaccessible, ex∣cept
in summer; but from the foot of the
Col de Tende, the road lies through a plain
all the way to Turin. We took six hours
to travel from the inn where we had lodged
over the mountain to Limon, and five hours
from thence to Coni. Here we found our
baggage, which we had sent off by the car∣riers
one day before we departed from Nice;
and here we dismissed our guides, together
with the mules. In winter, you have a mule
for this whole journey at the rate of twenty
livres; and the guides are payed at the rate
of two livres a day, reckoning six days, three
for the journey to Coni, and three for their
return to Nice. We set out so early in the
morning in order to avoid the inconvenien∣cies
and dangers that attend the passage of
this mountain. The first of these arises
from your meeting with long strings of loaded
mules in a slippery road, the breadth of which
does not exceed a foot and an half. As it is
altogether impossible for two mules to pass
each other in such a narrow path, the mule∣teers
have made doublings or elbows in dif∣ferent
parts, and when the troops of mule<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
meet, the least numerous is obliged to turn
off into one of these doublings, and there
halt until the others are past. Travellers in
order to avoid this disagreeable delay, which
is the more vexatious, considering the excessive
cold, begin the ascent of the mountain early
in the morning before the mules quit their
inns. But the great danger of travelling here
when the sun is up, proceeds from what they
call the Valanches. These are balls of snow
detached from the mountains which over top
the road, either by the heat of the sun, or the
humidity of the weather. A piece of snow
thus loosened from the rock, though perhaps
not above three or four feet in diameter, in∣creases
sometimes in its descent to such a de∣gree,
as to become two hundred paces in
length, and rolls down with such rapidity,
that the traveller is crushed to death before
he can make three steps on the road. These
dreadful heaps drag every thing along with
them in their descent. They tear up huge
trees by the roots, and if they chance to fall
upon a house, demolish it to the foundation.
Accidents of this nature seldom happen in
the winter while the weather is dry; and yet
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
scarce a year passes in which some mules and
their drivers do not perish by the valanches.
At Coni we found the countess C—from
Nice, who had made the same journey in a
chair, carried by porters. This is no other
than a common elbow-chair of wood, with a
straw bottom, covered above with waxed cloth,
to protect the traveller from the rain or snow,
and provided with a foot-board upon which
the feet rest. It is carried like a sedan-chair;
and for this purpose six or eight porters are
employed at the rate of three or four livres a
head per day, according to the season, allow∣ing
three days for their return. Of these six
men, two are between the poles carrying like
common chairmen, and each of these is sup∣ported
by the other two, one at each hand:
but as those in the middle sustain the greatest
burthen, they are relieved by the others in a
regular rotation. In descending the moun∣tain,
they carry the poles on their shoulders,
and in that case, four men are employed, one
at each end.</P>
<P>At Coni, you may have a chaise to go
with the same horses to Turin, for which
you pay fifteen livres, and are a day and a
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
half on the way. You may post it, however,
in one day, and then the price is seven livres
ten sols per post, and ten sols to the postilion.
The method we took was that of cambiatura.
This is a chaise with horses shifted at the
same stages that are used in posting: but as
it is supposed to move slower, we pay but
five livres per post, and ten sols to the posti∣lion.
In order to quicken its pace, we gave
ten sols extraordinary to each postilion, and
for this gratification, he drove us even faster
than the post. The chaises are like those of
Italy, and will take on near two hundred
weight of baggage.</P>
<P>Coni is situated between two small streams,
and though neither very large nor populous,
is considerable for the strength of its fortifica∣tions.
It is honoured with the title of the
Maiden-Fortress, because though several times
besieged, it was never taken. The prince of
Conti invested it in the war of 1744; but he
was obliged to raise the siege, after having
given battle to the king of Sardinia. The
place was gallantly defended by the baron
Leutrum, a German protestant, the best gene∣ral
in the Sardinian service: but what con∣tributed
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
most to the miscarriage of the ene∣my,
was a long tract of heavy rains, which
destroyed all their works, and rendered their
advances impracticable.</P>
<P>I need not tell you that Piedmont is one
of the most fertile and agreeable countries
in Europe, and this the most agreeable part
of all Piedmont, though it now appeared to
disadvantage from the rigorous season of the
year: I shall only observe that we passed
through Sabellian, which is a considerable
town, and arrived in the evening at Turin.
We entered this fine city by the gate of Nice,
and passing through the elegant piazza di San
Carlo, took up our quarters at the Bona
Fama, which stands at one corner of the
great square, called La Piazza Castel.</P>

of Turin, I should be obliged to postpone
it till another opportunity, having no room

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Aix en Provence, <DATE>May 10, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM thus far on my way to England. I
had resolved to leave Nice, without hav∣ing
the least dispute with any one native of
the place; but I found it impossible to keep
this resolution. My landlord, Mr. C—, a
man of fashion, with whose family we had
always lived in friendship, was so reasonable
as to expect I should give him up the house
and garden, though they were to be paid
for till Michaelmas, and peremptorily de∣clared
I should not be permitted to sub-let
them to any other person. He had of his
own accord assured me more than once that
he would take my furniture off my hands,
and trusting to this assurance, I had lost the
opportunity of disposing it to advantage:
but, when the time of my departure drew
near, he refused to take it, at the same time
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
insisting upon having the key of the house
and garden, as well as on being paid the
whole rent directly, though it would not be
due till the middle of September. I was so
exasperated at this treatment from a man
whom I had cultivated with particular re∣spect,
that I determined to contest it at law:
but the affair was accommodated by the
mediation of a father of the Minims, a friend
to both, and a merchant of Nice, who
charged himself with the care of the house
and furniture. A stranger must conduct him∣self
with the utmost circumspection to be able
to live among these people without being the
dupe of imposition.</P>
<P>I had sent to Aix for a coach and four
horses, which I hired at the rate of eighteen
French livres a day, being equal to fifteen
shillings and nine-pence sterling. The river
Var was so swelled by the melting of the
snow on the mountains, as to be impassable
by any wheel-carriage; and, therefore, the
coach remained at Antibes, to which we went
by water, the distance being about nine or
ten miles. This is the Antipolis of the an∣tients,
said to have been built like Nice, by a
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
colony from Marseilles. In all probability,
however, it was later than the foundation of
Nice, and took its name from its being si∣tuated
directly opposite to that city. Pliny
says it was famous for its tunny-fishery; and
to this circumstance Martial alludes in the
following lines:
<Q><L>“Antipolitani, fateor, sum filia thynni.</L>
<L>Essem si Scombri non tibi missa forem.”</L></Q>
At present, it is the frontier of France towards
Italy, pretty strongly fortified, and garrisoned
by a battalion of soldiers. The town is small
and inconsiderable: but the basin of the har∣bour
is surrounded to seaward by a curious
bulwark founded upon piles driven in the
water, consisting of a wall, ramparts, case∣mates,
and quay. Vessels lie very safe in this
harbour; but there is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot water at the en∣trance
of it to admit of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ips of any burthen.
The shallows run so far off from the coast,
that a ship of force cannot lie near enough
to batter the town; but it was bombarded in
the late war. Its chief strength by land
consists in a small quadrangular fort de∣tached
from the body of the place, which,
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
in a particular manner, commands the en∣trance
of the harbour. The wall of the
town built in the sea has embrasures and sa∣liant
angles, on which a great number of
cannon may be mounted.</P>
<P>I think the adjacent country is much more
pleasant than that on the side of Nice; and
there is certainly no essential difference in the
climate. The ground here is not so encum∣bered;
it is laid out in agreeable inclosures,
with intervals of open fields, and the moun∣tains
rise with an easy ascent at a much greater
distance from the sea, than on the other side
of the bay. Besides, here are charming rides
along the beach, which is smooth and firm,
When we passed in the last week of April, the
corn was the in ear; the cherries were almost
ripe; and the figs had begun to blacken. I
had embarked my heavy baggage on board a
London ship, which happened to be at Nice,
ready to sail: as for our small trunks or port∣manteaus,
which we carried along with us,
they were examined at Antibes; but the cere∣mony
was performed very superficially, in
consequence of tipping the searcher with half
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
a crown, which is a wonderful conciliator at
all the bureaus in this country.</P>
<P>We lay at Cannes, a neat village, charm∣ingly
situated on the beach of the Mediter∣ranean,
exactly opposite to the isles Mar∣guerites,
where state-prisoners are confined.
As there are some good houses in this place,
I would rather live here for the sake of the
mild climate, than either at Antibes or Nice.
Here you are not cooped up within walls,
nor crouded with soldiers and people: but are
already in the country, enjoy a fine air, and
are well supplied with all sorts of fish.</P>
<P>The mountain of Esterelles, which in one
of my former letters I described as a most
romantic and noble plantation of ever-greens,
trees, shrubs, and aromatic plants, is at pre∣sent
quite desolate. Last summer, some exe∣crable
villains set fire to the pines, when the
wind was high. It continued burning for
months, and the conflagration extended above
ten leagues, consuming an incredible quan∣tity
of timber. The ground is now naked
on each side of the road, or occupied by the
black trunks of the trees, which have been
scorched without falling. They stand as so
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
many monuments of the judgment of heaven,
filling the mind with horror and compassion.
I could hardly refrain from shedding tears at
this dismal spectacle, when I recalled the
idea of what it was about eighteen months
ago.</P>
<P>As we stayed all night at Frejus, I had an
opportunity of viewing the amphitheatre at
leisure. As near as I can judge by the eye, it
is of the same dimensions with that of Nismes;
but shockingly dilapidated. The stone seats
rising from the arena are still extant, and
the cells under them, where the wild beasts
were kept. There are likewise the remains
of two galleries one over another; and two
vomitoria or great gateways at opposite sides
of the arena, which is now a fine green,
with a road through the middle of it: but
all the external architecture and the orna∣ments
are demolished. The most intire part
of the wall now constitutes part of a monas∣tery,
the monks of which, I am told, have
helped to destroy the amphitheatre, by re∣moving
the stones for their own purposes of
building. In the neighbourhood of this am∣phitheatre,
which stands without the walls,
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
are the vestiges of an old edifice, said to have
been the palace where the imperator or presi∣dent
resided: for it was a Roman colony,
much favoured by Julius Caesar, who gave it
the name of Forum Julii, and Civitas Foro∣juliensis.
In all probability, it was he who
built the amphitheatre, and brought hither
the water ten leagues from the river of
Ciagne, by means of an aqueduct, some
arcades of which are still standing on the
other side of the town. A great number of
statues were found in this place, together
with antient inscriptions, which have been
published by different authors. I need not
tell you that Julius Agricola, the father-in-law
of Tacitus, the historian, was a native of
Frejus, which is now a very poor inconsi∣derable
place. From hence the country
opens to the left, forming an extensive plain
between the sea and the mountains, which
are a continuation of the Alps, that stretches
through Provence and Dauphiné. This plain
watered with pleasant streams, and varied
with vineyards, corn-fields, and meadow-ground,
afforded a most agreeable prospect
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our eyes, which were accustomed to the
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
sight of scorching sands, rugged rocks, and
abrupt mountains in the neighbourhood of
Nice. Although this has much the appear∣ance
of a corn-country, I am told it does
not produce enough for the consumption of
its inhabitants, who are obliged to have an∣nual
supplies from abroad, imported at Mar∣seilles.
A Frenchman, at an average, eats
three times the quantity of bread that satisfies
a native of England, and indeed it is, un∣doubtedly
the staff of his life. I am there∣fore
surprized that the Provençaux do not
convert part of their vineyards into corn∣fields:
for they may boast of their wine as
they please; but that which is drank by the
common people, not only here, but also in
all the wine countries of France, is neither so
strong, nourishing, nor (in my opinion) so
pleasant to the taste as the small-beer of
England. It must be owned that all the pea∣sants
who have wine for their ordinary drink,
are of a diminutive size, in comparison of
those who use milk, beer, or even water;
and it is a constant observation, that when
there is a scarcity of wine, the common peo∣ple
are always more healthy, than in those
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
seasons when it abounds. The longer I live,
the more I am convinced that wine, and all
fermented liquors, are pernicious to the hu∣man
constitution; and that for the preserva∣tion
of health, and exhileration of the spirits,
there is no beverage comparable to simple
water. Between Luc and Toulon, the coun∣try
is delightfully parcelled out into inclosures.
Here is plenty of rich pasturage for black cat∣tle,
and a greater number of pure streams and
rivulets than I have observed in any other
parts of France.</P>
<P>Toulon is a considerable place, even exclu∣sive
of the basin, docks, and arsenal, which
indeed are such as justify the remark made
by a stranger when he viewed them
“The king of France (said he) is greater at
Toulon than at Versailles.” The quay, the
jetties, the docks, and magazines, are con∣trived
and executed with precision, order, so∣lidity,
and magnificence. I counted fourteen
ships of the line lying unrigged in the basin,
besides the Tonant of eighty guns, which
was in dock repairing, and a new frigate on
the stocks. I was credibly informed that in
the last war, the king of France was so ill-served
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
with cannon for his navy, that in every
action there was scarce a ship which had not
several pieces burst. These accidents did great
damage, and discouraged the French mariners
so such a degree, that they became more afraid
of their own guns than of those of the English.
There are now at Toulon above two thou∣sand
pieces of iron cannon unfit for service.
This is an undeniable proof of the weakness
and neglect of the French administration:
but a more surprizing proof of their im∣becility,
is the state of the fortifications that
defend the entrance of this very harbour. I
have some reason to think that they trusted
for its security entirely to our opinion that
it must be inaccessible. Capt. E—, of one
of our frigates, lately entered the harbour
with a contrary wind, which by obliging him
to tack, afforded an opportunity of sounding
the whole breadth and length of the passage.
He came in without a pilot, and made a pre∣tence
of buying cordage, or some other stores;
but the French officers were much chagrined
at the boldness of his enterprize. They al∣ledged
that he came for no other reason but
to found the channel; and that he had an
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
engineer aboard, who made drawings of the
land and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts, their bearings and distances.
In all probability, these suspicions were com∣municated
to the ministry; for an order
immediately arrived, that no stranger should
be admitted into the docks and arsenal.</P>
<P>Part of the road from hence to Marseilles
lies through a vast mountain, which resem∣bles
that of Estrelles; but is not so well co∣vered
with wood, though it has the advan∣tage
of an agreeable stream running through
the bottom.</P>
<P>I was much pleased with Marseilles, which
is indeed a noble city, large, populous, and
flourishing. The streets, for the most part,
are open, airy, and spacious; the houses well
built, and even magnificent. The harbour is
an oval basin, surrounded on every side either
by the buildings or the land, so that the
shipping lies perfectly secure; and here is
generally an incredible number of vessels.
On the city side, there is a semi-circular quay
of free-stone, which extends thirteen hundred
paces; and the space between this and the
houses that front it, is continually filled with
a surprising croud of people. The gallies,
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
to the number of eight or nine, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with their sterns to one part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and the slaves are permitted to work for their
own benefit at their respective occupations, in
little shops or booths, which they rent for a
trifle. There you see tradesmen of all kinds
sitting at work, chained by one foot, shoe∣makers,
taylors, silversmiths, watch and clock∣makers,
barbers, stocking-weavers, jewellers,
pattern-drawers, scriveners, booksellers, cut∣lers,
and all manner of shop-keepers. They
pay about two sols a day to the king for this
indulgence; live well and look jolly; and
can afford to sell their goods and labour much
cheaper than other dealers and tradesmen.
At night, however, they are obliged to lie
aboard. Notwithstanding the great face of
business at Marseilles, their trade is greatly
on the decline; and their merchants are fail∣ing
every day. This decay of commerce is
in a great measure owing to the English,
who, at the peace, poured in such a quantity
of European merchandize into Martinique
and Guadalupe, that when the merchants of
Marseilles sent over their cargoes, they found
the markets overstocked, and were obliged
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
to sell for a considerable loss. Besides, the
French colonists had such a stock of sugars,
coffee, and other commodities lying by them
during the war, that upon the first notice of
peace, they shipped them off in great quan∣tities
for Marseilles. I am told that the pro∣duce
of the islands is at present cheaper here
than where it grows; and on the other hand
the merchandize of this country sells for less
money at Martinique than in Provence.</P>
<P>A single person, who travels in this coun∣try,
may live at a reasonable rate in these
towns, by eating at the public ordinaries:
but I would advise all families that come hi∣ther
to make any stay, to take furnished
lodgings as soon as they can: for the expence
of living at an hotel is enormous. I was
obliged to pay at Marseilles four livres a head
for every meal, and half that price for my ser∣vant,
and was charged six livres a day besides
for the apartment; so that our daily expence,
including breakfast and a valet de place, a∣mounted
to two loui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dores. The same im∣position
prevails all over the south of France,
though it is the cheapest and most plentiful
part of the kingdom. Without all doubt, it
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
must be owing to the folly and extravagance
of English travellers, who have allowed them∣selves
to be fleeced without wincing, until
this extortion is become authorized by custom.
It is very disagreeable riding in the avenues of
Marseilles, because you are confined in a dusty
high road, crouded with carriages and beasts
of burden, between two white walls, the re∣flection
from which, while the sun shines,
is intolerable. But in this neighbourhood
there is a vast number of pleasant country-houses,
called Bastides, said to amount to
twelve thousand, some of which may be
rented ready furnished at a very reasonable
price. Marseilles is a gay city, and the in∣habitants
indulge themselves in a variety of
amusements. They have assemblies, a concert
spirituel, and a comedy. Here is also a spa∣cious
cours, or walk shaded with trees, to
which in the evening there is a great resort
of well-dressed people.</P>
<P>Marseilles being a free port, there is a
bureau about half a league from the city on
the road to Aix, where all carriages undergo
examination; and if any thing contraband is
found, the vehicle, baggage, and even the
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
horses are confiscated. We escaped this dis∣agreeable
ceremony by the sagacity of our
driver. Of his own accord, he declared at
the bureau, that we had bought a pound of
coffee and some sugar at Marseilles, and were
ready to pay the duty, which amounted to a∣bout
ten sols. They took the money, gave
him a receipt, and let the carriage pass, with∣out
further question.</P>
<P>I proposed to stay one night only at Aix:
but Mr. A—r, who is here, had found such
benefit from drinking the waters, that I was
persuaded to make trial of them for eight or
ten days. I have accordingly taken private
lodgings, and drank them every morning at
the fountain-head, not without finding con∣siderable
benefit. In my next I shall say
something further of these waters, though I
am afraid they will not prove a source of much
entertainment. It will be sufficient for me
to find them contribute in any degree to the
health of</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulgne, <DATE>May 23, 1765,</DATE></DATELINE>
DEAR DOCTOR,</OPENER>
<P>I Found three English families at Aix, with
whom I could have passed my time very
agreeably; but the society is now dissolved.
Mr. S—re and his lady left the place in a
few days after we arrived. Mr. A—r and
lady Betty are gone to Geneva; and Mr.
G—r with his family remains at Aix. This
gentleman, who laboured under a most dread∣ful
nervous asthma, has obtained such relief
from this climate, that he intends to stay ano∣ther
year in the place: and Mr. A—r found
surprizing benefit from drinking the waters,
for a scorbutical complaint. As I was in∣commoded
by both these disorders, I could
not but in justice to myself, try the united
efforts of the air and the waters; especially
as this consideration was re-inforced by the
kind and pressing exhortations of Mr. A—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
and lady Betty, which I could not in grati∣tude
resist.</P>
<P>Aix, the capital of Provence, is a large
city, watered by the small river Are. It was
a Roman colony, said to be founded by Ca∣ius
Sextus Calvinus, above a century before
the birth of Christ. From the source of mi∣neral
water here found, added to the consul's
name, it was called Aquae Sextiae. It was
here that Marius, the conqueror of the Teu∣tones,
fixed his head-quarters, and embel∣lisheed
the place with temples, aqueducts,
and thermae, of which, however, nothing
now remains. The city, as it now stands,
is well built, though the streets in general
are narrow, and kept in a very dirty condi∣tion.
But it has a noble <HI>cours</HI> planted with
double rows of tall trees, and adorned with
three or four fine fountains, the middlemost
of which discharges hot water supplied from
the source of the baths. On each side there
is a row of elegant houses, inhabited chiefly
by the noblesse, of which there is here a con∣siderable
number. The parliament, which is
held at Aix, brings hither a great resort of
people; and as many of the inhabitants are
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
persons of fashion, they are well bred, gay,
and sociable. The duc de Villars, who is
governor of the province, resides on the spot,
and keeps an open assembly, where strangers
are admitted without reserve, and made very
welcome, if they will engage in play, which
is the sole occupation of the whole company.
Some of our English people complain, that
when they were presented to him, they met
with a very cold reception. The French, as
well as other foreigners, have no idea of a
man of family and fashion, without the title
of duke, count, marquis, or lord, and where
an English gentleman is introduced by the
simple expression of <HI>monsieur tel,</HI> they think
he is some plebeian, unworthy of any par∣ticular
attention.</P>
<P>Aix is situated in a bottom, almost sur∣rounded
by hills, which, however do not
screen it from the Bize, or north wind, that
blows extremely sharp in the winter and
spring, rendering the air almost insupportably
cold, and very dangerous to those who have
some kinds of pulmonary complaints, such
as tubercules, abscesses, or spitting of blood.
Lord H—, who passed part of last winter
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
in this place, afflicted with some of these
symptoms, grew worse every day while he
continued at Aix: but, he no sooner re∣moved
to Marseilles, than all his complaints
abated; such a difference there is in the air
of these two places, though the distance be∣tween
them does not exceed ten or twelve
miles. But the air of Marseilles, though
much more mild than that of Aix in the
winter, is not near so warm as the climate of
Nice, where we find in plenty such flowers,
fruit, and vegetables, even in the severest sea∣son,
as will not grow and ripen, either at
Marseilles or Toulon.</P>
<P>If the air of Aix is disagreeably cold in
the winter, it is rendered quite insufferable in
the summer, from excessive heat, occasioned
by the reflexion from the rocks and moun∣tains,
which at the same time obstruct the
circulation of air: for it must be observed,
that the same mountains which serve as fun∣nels
and canals, to collect and discharge the
keen blasts of winter, will provide screens to
incercept intirely the faint breezes of summer.
Aix, though pretty well provided with butch∣er's
meat, is very ill supplied with pot-herbs;
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
and they have no poultry but what comes at
a vast distance from the Lionnois. They say
their want of roots, cabbage, cauliflower, &amp;c.
is owing to a scarcity of water: but the
truth is, they are very bad gardeners. Their
oil is good and cheap: their wine is indiffe∣rent:
but their chief care seems employed on
the culture of silk, the staple of Provence,
which is every where shaded with plantations
of mulberry trees, for the nourishment of the
worms. Notwithstanding the boasted cheap∣ness
of every article of housekeeping, in the
south of France, I am persuaded a family may
live for less money at York, Durham, Here∣ford,
and in many other cities of England
than at Aix in Provence; keep a more plen∣tiful
table; and be much more comfortably
situated in all respects. I found lodging and
provision at Aix fifty per cent, dearer than at
Montpellier, which is counted the dearest
place in Languedoc.</P>
<P>The baths of Aix, so famous in antiquity,
were quite demolished by the irruptions of,
the Barbarians. The very source of the
water was lost, till the beginning of the pre∣sent
century, (I think the year 1704) when it
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
was discovered by accident, in digging for the
foundation of a house, at the foot of a
hill, just without the city wall. Near the
same place was found a small stone altar,
with the figure of a Priapus, arid some letters
in capitals, which the antiquarians have dif∣ferently
interpreted. From this figure, it
was supposed that the waters were efficacious
in cases of barrenness. It was a long time,
however, before any person would venture to
use them internally, as it did not appear
that they had ever been drank by the anti∣ents.
On their re-appearance, they were
chiefly used for baths to horses, and other
beasts; which had the mange, and other cuta∣neous
eruptions. At length poor people be∣gan
to bathe in them for the same disorders,
and received such benefit from them, as at∣tracted
the attention of more curious inqui∣rers.
A very superficial and imperfect: ana∣lysis
was made and published, with a few
remarkable histories of the cures they had
performed, by three different physicians of
those days; and those little treatises, I sup∣pose,
encouraged valetudinarians to drink
them without ceremony. They were found
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
serviceable in the gout, the gravel, scurvy,
dropsy, palsy, indigestion, asthma, and con∣sumption;
and their fame soon extended itself
all over Languedoc, Gascony, Dauphiné, and
Provence. The magistrates, with a view to
render them more useful and commodious,
have raised a plain building, in which there
are a couple of private baths, with a bed∣chamber
adjoining to each, where individuals
may use them both internally and exter∣nally,
for a moderate expence. These baths
are paved with marble, and supplied with
water each by a large brass cock, which
you can turn at pleasure. At one end of
this edifice, there is an octagon, open at top,
having a bason, with a stone pillar in the
middle, which discharges water from the
same source, all round, by eight small brass
cocks; and hither people of all ranks come
of a morning, with their glasses, to drink
the water, or wash their sores, or subject
their contracted limbs to the stream. This
last operation, called the <HI>douche,</HI> how∣ever,
is more effectually undergone in the
private bath, where the stream is much more
powerful. The natural warmth of this
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
water, as nearly as I can judge from recol∣lection,
is about the same degree of tempe∣rature
with that in the Queen's Bath, at
Bath in Somersetshire. It is perfectly trans∣parent,
sparkling in the glass, light and agree∣able
to the taste, and may be drank without
any preparation, to the quantity of three or
four pints at a time. There are many peo∣ple
at Aix who swallow fourteen half pint
glasses every morning, during the season,
which is in the month of May, though it
may be taken with equal benefit all the year
round. It has no sensible operation but by
urine, an effect which pure water would
produce, if drank in the same quantity.</P>
<P>If we may believe those who have pub∣lished
their experiments, this water produces
neither agitation, cloud, or change of colour,
when mixed with acids, alkalies, tincture of
galls, syrup of violets, or solution of silver.
The residue, after boiling, evaporation, and
filtration, affords a very small proportion of
purging falt, and calcarious earth, which last
ferments with strong acids. As I had neither
hydrometer nor thermometer to ascertain the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ight and warmth of this water; nor time
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
to procure the proper utensils, to make the
preparations, and repeat the experiments ne∣cessary
to exhibit a complete analysis, I did
not pretend to enter upon this process; but
contented myself with drinking, bathing, and
using the <HI>douche,</HI> which perfectly answered
my expectation, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, in eight days, almost
cured an ugly scorbutic tetter, which had
for some time deprived me of the use of my
right hand. I observed that the water, when
used externally, left always a kind of oily
appearance on the skin: that when we boil∣ed
it at home, in an earthen pot, the steams
smelled like those of sulphur, and even af∣fected
my lungs in the same manner: but
the bath itself smelled strong of a lime-kiln.
The water, after standing all night in a
bottle, yielded a remarkably vinous taste and
odour, something analogous to that of dul∣cified
spirit of nitre. Whether the active
particles consist of a volatile vitriol, or a very
fine petroleum, or a mixture of both, I shall
not pretend to determine: but the best way I
know of discovering whether it is really im∣pregnated
with a vitriolic principle, too sub∣til
and fugitive, for the. usual operations of
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
chymistry, is to place bottles, filled with wine,
in the bath, or adjacent room, which wine,
if there is really a volatile acid, in any consi∣derable
quantity, will be pricked in eight and
forty hours.</P>
<P>Having ordered our coach to be refitted,
and provided with fresh horses, as well as
with another postilion, in consequence of
which improvements, I payed at the rate of
a loui'dore <HI>per diem</HI> to Lyons and back again,
we departed from Aix, and the second day of
our journey passing the Durance in a boat,
lay at Avignon. This river, the Druentia of
the antients, is a considerable stream, ex∣tremely
rapid, which descends from the moun∣tains,
and discharges itself in the Rhone.
After violent rains it extends its channel, so as
to be impassible, and often overflows the
country to a great extent. In the middle of
a plain, betwixt Orgon and this river, we
met the coach in which we had travelled
eighteen months before, from Lyons to
Montpellier, conducted by our old driver
Joseph, who no sooner recognized my
servant at a distance, by his musque∣toon,
than he came running towards
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
our carriage, and seizing my hand, even
shed tears of joy. Joseph had been tra∣velling
through Spain, and was so im∣browned
by the sun, that he might have
passed for an Iroquois. I was much pleased
with the marks of gratitude which the poor
fellow expressed towards his benefactors. He
had some private conversation with our <HI>voitu∣rier,</HI>
whose name was Claude, to whom he
gave such a favourable character of us, as in
all probablity induced him to be wonderfully
obliging during the whole journey.</P>
<P>You know Avignon is a large city be∣longing
to the pope. It was the <HI>Avenio
Cavarum</HI> of the antients, and changed
masters several times, belonging successively
to the Romans, Burgundians, Franks, the
kingdom of Arles, the counts of Provence,
and the sovereigns of Naples. It was sold in
the fourteenth century, by queen Jane I. of
Naples, to pope Clement VI. for the sum of
eighty thousand florins, and since that period
has continued under the dominion of the see of
Rome. Not but that when the duc de Cre∣qui,
the French ambassador, was insulted at
Rome in the year 1662, the parliament of
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
Provence passed an arret, declaring the city of
Avignon, and the county Venaissin, part of the
ancient domain of Provence; and therefore
reunited it to the crown of France, which
accordingly took possession; though it was
afterwards restored to the Roman see at the
peace of Pisa. The pope, however, holds it
by a precarious title, at the mercy of the
French king, who may one day be induced
to resume it, upon payment of the original
purchase-money. As a succession of popes
resided here for the space of seventy years,
the city could not fail to be adorned with a
great number of magnificent churches and
convents, which are richly embellished with
painting, sculpture, shrines, reliques, and
tombs. Among the last, is that of the cele∣brated
Laura, whom Petrarch has immorta∣lized
by his poetry, and for whom Francis I.
of France took the trouble to write an epi∣taph.
Avignon is governed by a vice-legate
from the pope, and the police of the city is
regulated by the consuls. It is a large place,
situated in a fruitful plain, surrounded by
high walls built of hewn stone, which on the
west side are washed by the Rhone. Here
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
was a noble bridge over the river, but it is
now in ruins. On the other side, a branch of
the Sorgue runs through part of the city.
This is the river anciently called Sulga,
formed by the famous Fountain of Vaucluse
in this neighbourhood, where the poet Pe∣trarch
resided. It is a charming transparent
stream, abounding with excellent trout and
craw-fish. We passed over it on a stone
bridge, in our way to Orange, the <HI>Arausio
Cavarum</HI> of the Romans, still distinguished
by some noble monuments of antiquity.
These consist of a circus, an aqueduct, a
temple, and a triumphal arch, which last was
erected in honour of Caius Marius, and Luc∣tatius
Catulus, after the great victory they
obtained in this country over the Cimbri and
Teutones. It is a very magnificent edifice,
adorned on all sides with trophies and bat∣tles
in basso relievo. The ornaments of the
architecture, and the sculpture, are wonder∣fully
elegant for the time in which it was
erected; and the whole is surprisingly well
preserved, considering its great antiquity. It
seems to me to be as entire and perfect as the
arch of Septimius Severus at Rome. Next
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
day we passed two very impetuous streams,
the Drome and the Isere. The first, which
very much resembles the Var, we forded: but
the Isere we crossed in a boat, which as well
as that upon the Durance, is managed by the
traille, a moveable or running pulley, on a
rope stretched between two wooden machines
erected on the opposite sides of the river.
The contrivance is simple and effectual, and
the passage equally safe and expeditious. The
boatman has nothing to do, but by means
of a long massy rudder, to keep the
head obliquely to the stream, the force of
which pushes the boat along, the block to
which it is fixed sliding upon the rope from
one side to the other. All these rivers take
their rise from the mountains, which are con∣tinued
through Provence and Dauphiné, and
fall into the Rhone: and all of them, when
swelled by sudden rains, overflow the flat
country. Although Dauphiné affords little
or no oil, it produces excellent wines, parti∣cularly
those of Hermitage and Cote-roti.
The first of these is sold on the spot for
three livres the bottle, and the other for two.
The country likewise yields a considerable
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
quantity of corn, and a good deal of grass.
It is well watered with streams, and agree∣ably
shaded with wood. The weather was
pleasant, and we had a continued song of
nightingales from Aix to Fountainbleau.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to specify the antiquities
of Vienne, antiently called Vienna Allobro∣gum.
It was a Roman colony, and a consi∣derable
city, which the antients spared no
pains and expence to embellish. It is still a
large town, standing among several hills on
the banks of the Rhone, though all its for∣mer
splendor is eclipsed, its commerce decayed,
and most of its antiquities are buried in ruins.
The church of Notre Dame de la Vie was
undoubtedly a temple. On the left of the
road, as you enter it, by the gate of Avignon,
there is a handsome obelisk, or rather pyra∣mid,
about thirty feet high, raised upon a
vault supported by four pillars of the Tuscan
order. It is certainly a Roman work, and
Montfaucon supposes it to be a tomb, as he
perceived an oblong stone jetting out from the
middle of the vault, in which the ashes of
the defunct were probably contained. The
story of Pontius Pilate, who is said to have
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
ended his days in this place, is a fable. On
the seventh day of our journey from Aix, we
arrived at Lyons, where I shall take my leave
of you for the present, being with great
truth,</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at last in a situation to indulge my
view with a sight of Britain, after an
absence of two years; and indeed you cannot
imagine what pleasure I feel while I survey
the white cliffs of Dover, at this distance.
Not that I am at all affected by the <HI>nescia qua
dulcedine natalis soli,</HI> of Horace. That seems
to be a kind of fanaticism founded on the
prejudices of education, which induces a Lap∣lander
to place the terrestrial paradise among
the snows of Norway, and a Swiss to pre∣fer
the barren mountains of Solleure to the
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
fruitful plains of Lombardy. I am attached
to my country, because it is the land of li∣berty,
cleanliness, and convenience: but I
love it still more tenderly, as the scence of all
my interesting connexions; as the habitation
of my friends, for whose conversation, cor∣respondence,
and esteem, I wish alone to
live.</P>
<P>Our Journey hither from Lyons produced
neither accident nor adventure worth notice;
but abundance of little vexations, which may
be termed the Plagues of Posting. At Lyons,
where we stayed only a few days, I found a
return-coach, which I hired to Paris for six
loui'dores. It was a fine roomy carriage,
elegantly furnished, and made for travelling
so strong and solid in all its parts, that there
was no danger of its being shaken to pieces
by the roughness of the road: but its weight
and solidity occasioned so much friction be∣tween
the wheels and the axle-tree, that we
ran the risque of being set on fire three or
four times a day. Upon a just comparison
of all circumstances, posting is much more
easy, convenient, and reasonable in England
than in France. The English carriages,
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
horses, harness, and roads are much better;
and the postilions more obliging and alert.
The reason is plain and obvious. If I am
ill-used at the post-house in England, I can
be accommodated elsewhere. The publicans
on the road are sensible of this, and there∣fore
they vie with each other in giving satis∣faction
to travellers. But in France, where
the post is monopolized, the post-masters and
postilions, knowing that the traveller depends
intirely upon them, are the more negligent
and remiss in their duty, as well as the more
encouraged to insolence and imposition. In∣deed
the stranger seems to be left intirely at
the mercy of those fellows, except in large
towns, where he may have recourse to the
magistrate or commanding officer. The
post stands very often by itself in a lone
country situation, or in a paultry village,
where the post-master is the principal inha∣bitant;
and in such a case, if you should be
ill-treated, by being supplied with bad horses;
if you should be delayed on frivolous pre∣tences,
in order to extort money; if the
postilions should drive at a waggon pace, with
a view to provoke your impatience; or should
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
you in any shape be insulted by them or their
masters; I know not any redress you can
have, except by a formal complaint to the
comptroller of the posts, who is generally
one of the ministers of state, and pays little
or no regard to any such representations. I
know an English gentleman, the brother of
an earl, who wrote a letter of complaint to
the Duc de Villars, governor of Provence,
against the post-master of Antibes, who had
insulted and imposed upon him. The duke
answered his letter, promising to take order
that the grievance should be redressed; and
never thought of it after. Another great in∣convenience
which attends posting in France,
is that if you are retarded by any accident,
you cannot in many parts of the kingdom
find a lodging, without perhaps travelling two
or three posts farther than you would choose
to go, to the prejudice of your health, and
even the hazard of your life; whereas, on
any part of the post-road in England, you
will meet with tolerable accommodation at
every stage. Through the whole south of
France, except in large cities, the inns are
cold, damp, dark, dismal, and dirty; the
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
landlords equally disobliging and rapacious;
the servants aukward, sluttish, and slothful;
and the postilions lazy, lounging, greedy, and
impertinent. If you chide them far lingering,
they will continue to delay you the longer:
if you chastise them with sword, cane, cudgel,
or horse-whip, they will either disappear en∣tirely,
and leave you without resource; or
they will find means to take vengeance by
overturning your carriage. The best me∣thod
I know of travelling with any degree
of comfort, is to allow yourself to become
the dupe of imposition, and stimulate their
endeavours by extraordinary gratifications.
I laid down a resolution (and kept it) to give
no more than four and twenty sols per post
between the two postilions; but I am now
persuaded that for three-pence a post more, I
should have been much better served, and
should have performed the journey with
much greater pleasure. We met with no
adventures upon the road worth reciting.
The first day we were retarded above two
hours by the dutchess D—lle, and her son
the duc de R—f—t, who by virtue of an
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
order from the minister, had anticipated
all the horses at the post. They accosted my
servant, and asked if his master was a lord?
He thought proper to answer in the affirma∣tive;
upon which the duke declared that
he must certainly be of French extraction,
inasmuch as he observed the lillies of France
in his arms on the coach. This young
nobleman spoke a little English. He asked
whence we had come; and understanding
we had been in Italy, desired to know whe∣ther
the man liked France or Italy best? Upon
his giving France the preference, he clapped
him on the shoulder, and said he was a lad
of good taste. The dutchess asked if her
son spoke English well, and seemed mightily
pleased when my man assured her he did.
They were much more free and condescend∣ing
with my servant than with myself; for,
though we saluted them in passing, and were
even supposed to be persons of quality, they
did not open their lips, while we stood close
by them at the inn-door, till their horses
were changed. They were going to Geneva;
and their equipage consisted of three coaches
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
and six, with five domestics a horseback.
The dutchess was a tall, thin, raw-boned
woman, with her head close shaved. This
delay obliged us to lie two posts short of
Macon, at a solitary auberge called Maison
Blanche, which had nothing white about it,
but the name. The Lionnois is one of the
most agreeable and best cultivated countries I
ever beheld, diversified with hill, dale, wood,
and water, laid out in extensive corn-fields
and rich meadows, well stocked with black
cattle; and adorned with a surprising number
of towns, villages, villas, and convents,
generally situated on the brows of gently
swelling hills, so that they appear to the
greatest advantage. What contributes in a
great measure to the beauty of this, and the
Maconnois, is the charming pastoral Soame,
which from the city of Chalons winds it
silent course so smooth and gentle, that one
can scarce discern which way its current flows.
It is this placid appearance that tempts so
many people to bathe in it at Lions, where
a good number of individuals are drowned
every summer: whereas there is no instance
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
of any persons thus perishing in the Rhone,
the rapidity of it deterring every body from
bathing in its stream. Next night we passed
at Beaune, where we found nothing good
but the wine, for which we paid forty sols
the bottle. At Chalons our axle-tree took
fire; an accident which detained us so long,
that it was ten before we arrived at Auxerre,
where we lay. In all probability we must
have lodged in the coach, had not we been
content to take four horses, and pay for six,
two posts successively. The alternative was,
either to proceed with four on those terms, or
stay till the other horses should come in and
be refreshed. In such an emergency, I
would advise the traveller to put up with the
four, and he will find the postilions so much
upon their mettle, that those stages will be
performed sooner than the others in which
you have the full complement.</P>
<P>There was an English gentleman laid up at
Auxerre with a broken arm, to whom I sent
my compliments, with offers of service; but
his servant told my man that he did not choose
to see any company, and had no occasion for
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
my service. This sort of reserve seems pecu∣liar
to the English disposition. When two
natives of any other country chance to meet
abroad, they run into each other's embrace
like old friends, even though they have never
heard of one another till that moment;
whereas two Englishmen in the same situa∣tion
maintain a mutual reserve and diffi∣dence,
and keep without the sphere of each
other's attraction, like two bodies endowed
with a repulsive power. We only stopped to
change horses at Dijon, the capital of Bur∣gundy,
which is a venerable old city; but
we passed part of a day at Sens, and visited
a manufacture of that stuff we call Man∣chester
velvet, which is here made and dyed
to great perfection, under the direction of
English workmen, who have been seduced
from their own country. At Fontainbleau,
we went to see the palace, or, as it is called,
the castle, which though an irregular pile
of building, affords a great deal of lodging,
and contains some very noble apartments,
particularly the hall of audience, with the
king's and queen's chambers, upon which
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
the ornaments of carving and gilding are
lavished with profusion rather than propriety.
Here are some rich parterres of flower-garden,
and a noble orangerie, which how∣ever
we did not greatly admire, after having
lived among the natural orange groves of
Italy. Hitherto we had enjoyed fine sum∣mer
weather, and I found myself so well,
that I imagined my health was interely re∣stored:
but betwixt Fontainebleau and Paris,
we were overtaken by a black storm of rain,
sleet, and hail, which seemed to reinstate
winter in all its rigour; for the cold wea∣ther
continues to this day. There was no
resisting this attack. I caught cold imme∣diately;
and this was reinforced at Paris,
where I stayed but three days. The same
man, (Pascal Sellier, rüe Guenegaud faux∣bourg
St. Germain) who owned the coach
that brought us from Lyons, supplied me with
a returned berline to Boulogne, for six loui'∣dores,
and we came hither by easy journeys.
The first night we lodged at Breteuil, where
we found an elegant inn, and very good
accommodation. But the next we were
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
forced to take up our quarters, at the house
where we had formerly passed a very dis∣agreeable
night at Abbeville. I am now in
tolerable lodging, where I shall remain a
few weeks, merely for the sake of a little
repose; then I shall gladly tempt that
invidious straight which still divides you

<P>ONE of mercury, constructed after the manner

boiling-water 80 degrees. The excessive heat at
Paris 1707, at 35 degrees.</P>

THE town of Nice is situated in the bay
of Antibes, latitude forty-three degrees,
forty minutes north; east longitude from London,
seven degrees, twenty-five minutes, aequidistant
from Marseilles, Genoa, and Turin, that is
about ninety English miles. The north wind
blows over the maritime Alps, at the feet of
which the town is situated; the south from
Cape Bona, on the coast of Barbary, sweeping
the islands of Sardinia and Corsica in its passage:
the east from the Riviera of Genoa; and the
west from Provence.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is wedged between a steep
rock to the eastward, and the river Paglion,
which washes the walls upon the west, and falls
into the Mediterranean, within thirty yards of
the corner bastion.</P>
<P>This river is but a scanty stream, fed chiefly
by the melting of the snow upon the mountains.
It is sometimes swelled to a great depth by
sudden torrents: but in the summer it is usually
dry.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is built of stone, and the
streets are narrow. It is said to contain twelve
thousand inhabitants, in which case they must
be much crowded, for the place is but small.
There is a bridge of three arches over the
Paglion, which is the entrance from the side
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
of Provence. Nice is surrounded on this side
by a wall and rampart of no strength: on the
other side, it is commanded by a high rock,
on which appear the ruins of an old castle,
which was once deemed impregnable. It was
taken and dismantled by Marechal Catinat,
in the reign of Victor Amadeus, father to the
present king of Sardinia. To the eastward of
this rock is the harbour of Nice, in which there
is not depth of water sufficient for ships of any
burthen. The hills begin to rise about a short
mile from the north gate of the town. The
Var falls into the sea about four miles to the
west ward; and is fordable at the village of St.
Laurent, which stands on the French side near
the mouth of the river. The space between
the Var and Nice is a succession of agreeable
eminences, adorned with a great number of
white houses or cassines, surrounded by planta∣tions
of olives, vines, oranges, lemons, and
citrons. The air of Nice is pure and penetrat∣ing,
yet mild, generally dry, and elastic; and
the sky is remarkably clear and serene. The
well-water is mostly hard, but not unwhole∣some;
and there are some springs both in the
town and neighbourhood, which are surpriz∣ingly
cool, limpid, and agreeable.</P>
