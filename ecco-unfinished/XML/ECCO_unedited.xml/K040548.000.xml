<P>The Purport of the above Fable is this. When the She-Goats had, by their intreaties, obtained of Jupiter the privilege of having Beards as well as the Males, the He-Goats grew angry; and complained, that he had degraded their dignity by admitting the females to equal honours with themselves.</P>
<P>To which the God replied, That if they would take care to preserve the real and essential advantages which their sex gave them over the other, they would have no reason to be dissatisfied with letting them participate in what was merely ornamental.</P>

<L>(So frugal were the Bards of old)</L>
<L>A Tale of Goats; and clos'd with grace</L>

<L><HI>They</HI> are our masters now, and We</L>

<L>(They can't escape the Traveller's eye,</L>

<L>A Herd of Goats, each shining morn,</L>
<L>Midst scraggy myrtle, pointed thorn,</L>
<L>Quick glancing to the Sun display'd</L>
<L>Their spotted sides, and pierc'd the shade.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas there—and there (no matter when)</L>
<L>With VIRGIL'S leave, we place the scene.</L>
<L>For scarcely can we think his swains</L>

<L>Much less could e'er his Shepherds dream</L>

<L>How bright the sun, how soft the air,</L>

<L>The fair enthusiasts thus address'd:</L>
<L>"Ladies, I joy to see, what I</L>

<L>A general murmur of applause</L>

<L>Agreed. And now with secret care</L>

<L>Unwilling, for decorum's sake,</L>
<L>Quite to unite, or quite to break.</L>
<L>With short, half words, and looks that leer'd,</L>
