<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Earl of <HI>DORSET</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMongst the numerous Throng that have address'd your Lordship as the undoubted Patron of Wit and Poetry, I presume to approach.</P>
<P>We are taught that Heaven its self re∣ceives the humblest Offering when fer∣vent Zeal supplies the want of Power.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>Nor is there in that admiring Crowd, who have laid their Lawrels at your Lordship's Feet, one who can truly boast a more profound Respect than my self, which is my only Plea for want of Merit, to intitle me to your Lordship's Protection.</P>
<P>The courteous Affability with which your Lordship once receiv'd a Trifle from my Hand, rais'd such grateful Sen∣timents in my Breast, that I have ever since been ambitious to have your glo∣rious Name prefixt as a Sanction for something of mine, which must render it authentick, tho' 'tis what I must blush to lay before you.</P>
<P>To you alone the Muses pay their grateful Tribute; they are your Slaves, and on whatsoever Theam you bid 'em sing, they readily obey, and glad the lissening World.</P>
<P>But hold, it is above my Sphere to enter on Encomiums where the Subject's
<PB REF="4"/>
so sublime, when the most artful Pen has drawn fictitious Heroes, great, wise, affable, and just. How far short wou'd the Poets raptur'd Flights appear, set in the same Light with the real Character of my Lord of <HI>Dorset</HI>.</P>
<P>Heaven seems to take peculiar Care of that great Spirit it first infus'd in You, transferring a mighty Portion to Your illustrious Son; and in his sprightly Youth we see renew'd the Charms of Yours.</P>
<P>Your noble Line, Your splendid For∣tunes, and Your beauteous Offspring, all speak You blest; and we have only left to wish, that cheerful Hours of Health may crown long Life, and nothing in∣terrupt Your Happiness.</P>
<P>If this Play is so lucky as to be ho∣nour'd with Your Lordship's perusal, I shall reach the Height of my Ambi∣tion.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>I humbly ask Your Lordship's Pardon for the Liberty I have taken in laying this Poem at Your Feet, whilst the Au∣thor at humble Distance begs Leave to subscribe,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WRiting is a kind of Lottery in this fickle Age, and Dependence on the Stage as pre∣carious as the Cast of a Die; the Chance may turn up, and a Man may write to please the Town, but 'tis uncertain, since we see our best Authors sometimes fail. The Criticks cavil most about Decorums, and crie up <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Rules as the most essential part of the Play; I own they are in the right of it, yet I dare venture a Wa∣ger they'll never persuade the Town to be of their Opinion, which relishes nothing so well as Humour lightly tost up with Wit, and drest with Modesty and Air. And I believe Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> will own, he got more by the <HI>Trip to the Jubilee</HI>, with all its Irregularities, than by the most uniform Piece the Stage cou'd boast of e'er since. I do not say this by way of condemning the Ʋnity of Time, Place, and Action; quite contrary, for I think them the greatest Beauties of a Dramatick Poem; but since the other way of writing pleases full
<PB REF="7"/>
as well, and gives the Poet a larger Scope of Fancy, and with less Trouble, Care, and Pains, serves his and the Players End, why shou'd a Man torture, and wrack his Brain for what will be no Advantage to him. This I dare engage, that the Town will ne'er be entertain'd with Plays according to the Me∣thod of the Ancients, till they exclude this Innovation of Wit and Humour, which yet I see no likelihood of doing. The following Poem I think has nothing can disoblige the ni∣cest Ear; and tho' I did not observe the Rules of <HI>Drama</HI>, I took peculiar Care to dress my Thoughts in such a modest Stile, that it might not give Offence to any. Some Scenes I confess are partly taken from <HI>Molier</HI>, and I dare be bold to say it has not suffer'd in the Translation: I thought 'em pretty in the French, and cou'd not help believing they might divert in an English Dress. The French have that light Airiness in their Temper, that the least Glimps of Wit sets them a laughing, when 'twou'd not make us so much as smile; so that where I found the Stile too poor, I endeavour'd to give it a Turn; for who e'er borrows from them, must take care to touch the Colours with an English Pencil, and form the Piece according to our Manners. When
<PB REF="8"/>
first I took those Scenes of <HI>Molier</HI>'s, I de∣sign'd but three Acts; for that reason I chose such as suited best with Farce, which indeed are all of that sort you'll find in it; for what I added to 'em, I believe my Reader will allow to be a different Stile, at least some very good Judges thought so, and in spight of me divi∣ded it into five Acts, believing it might pass amongst the Comedies of these Times. And in∣deed I have no reason to complain, for I confess it met a Reception beyond my Expectation: I must own my self infinitely oblig'd to the Players, and in a great Measure the Success was owing to them, especially Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, who extended his Facul∣ties to such a Pitch, that one may almost say he out-play'd himself; and the Town must confess they never saw three different Characters by one Man acted so well before, and I think my self extremely indebted to him, likewise to Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>, who in his way I think the best Comedian of the Age.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>POets like Mushroms rise and fall of late,</L>
<L>Or as th' uncertain Favourites of State,</L>
<L>Inventions rack'd to please both Eye and Ear,</L>
<L>But no Scene takes without the moving Player:</L>
<L>Daily we see Plays, Pamphlets, Libels, Rhimes,</L>
<L>Become the Falling-Sickness of the Times;</L>
<L>So feavourish is the Humor of the Town,</L>
<L>It surfeits of a Play e'er three Days run.</L>
<L>At <HI>Locket</HI>'s, <HI>Brown</HI>'s, and at <HI>Pontack</HI>'s enquire,</L>
<L>What modish Kick-shaws the nice Beaus desire,</L>
<L>What fam'd Ragoust, what new invented Salate</L>
<L>Has best Pretensions to regale the Palate.</L>
<L>If we present you with a Medly here,</L>
<L>A hogde podge Dish serv'd up in <HI>China</HI> Ware,</L>
<L>We hope 'twill please, 'cause like your Bills of Fare.</L>
<L>To please you all we shou'd attempt in vain,</L>
<L>In diff'rent Persons diff'rent Humors reign.</L>
<L>The Soldier's for the rattling Scenes of War,</L>
<L>The peaceful Beau hates shedding Blood so near.</L>
<L>Courtiers in Com'dy place their chief Delight,</L>
<L>'Cause Love's the proper Bus'ness of the Night.</L>
<L>The Clown for Pastoral his half Crown bestows,</L>
<L>But t'other House by sad Experience knows,</L>
<L>This polish'd Town produces few of those.</L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>The Merch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt is for Traffick ev'ry where,</L>
<L>And values not the best, but cheapest Ware:</L>
<L>Since various Humors are pleas'd various ways,</L>
<L>A Critick's but a Fool to judge of Plays.</L>
<L>Fool, did I say? 'Tis difficult to know</L>
<L>Who 'tis that's so indeed, or is not so:</L>
<L>If that be then a Point so hard to gain,</L>
<L>Wit's sure a most profound unfathom'd Main.</L>
<L>He that sits Judge, the Trident ought to sway,</L>
<L>To know who's greatest Fool, or Wit to Day,</L>
<L>The Audience, or the Author of the Play.</L>

<P>What wou'd you have me do? My Father's immovable, all my Tears and Entreaties are thrown away upon him, he's fix'd in his Design: Besides, I have not heard a word from <HI>Bellmie</HI> these two Days, nor know I the Reason on't.</P>

<P>These two Days! there's a Lover indeed, he deserves to lose his Mistress; does he consider what inconstant Things we Women are? Had he been my Servant, o'my Conscience, I shou'd have forgot him the first Day, and got a new one the second.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Toby</HI>.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did so, but did not think you had been of this Opinion; for I can assure you I shall marry, and the very Woman I design, and I warrant she'll like me ne'er the worse for my grey Hairs, as you call 'em.</P>

<P>You are very free, methinks.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are very handsome, faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not believe you think so.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Madam, stay but till my Friend comes, and he shall vouch for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is <HI>Bellmie</HI> your Friend, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think so, Madam ——I'm sure we have fought for each other, been drunk, whor'd and slept together, which are the common Symptoms of Friend∣ship. —Thus far your Query is answer'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very virtuous Symptoms truly, and concisely express'd. Well, Sir, and I may presume you partake of his Secrets to; for that is one part of Friendship, as I take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So— now has she a mind to discover something; poor Rogue, he has us'd her unkindly, I warrant.<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> Yes, faith, Madam, I think we are pretty free in those Matters; I don't believe he has any Secrets but what I know—except his Intrigue with you, which I cou'd find in my Heart to cuckold him for, for conceal∣ing it from me.<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, tell me, I hear he is mightily in Love with one <HI>Lucinda</HI> —will he marry her, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! She's jealous, I must not discover the Truth, lest the Consequence be prejudical to my Friend. <STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> I know there was some such talk once, Ma∣dam, but to my certain Knowledge it was never de∣sign'd by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! never design'd by him! you mistake sure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, I won't say he did not like her, because I believe he wou'd have done her the Favour, but she wou'd not consent upon any Terms; but that ever he had any Design of marrying her, I absolutely
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
deny. — I hope she'll believe me.<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!—yet it may be true, for the Earth produces not more Variety of Colours, than the Breast of Man Tricks to deceive: I am glad I know this, that <HI>Lucinda</HI> may not deceive her self with vain Hopes. <STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> And are you certain of this, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As certain as that I live, Child; and as a Proof of what I say, she's to be married to Morrow to Sir <HI>Toby Doubtful</HI>, and <HI>Bellmie</HI> designs to meet them at the Church-door with Musick, to congratulate her Mar∣riage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A generous Rival truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Madam, he's the most generous Man in the World; his Mistress, and his Pocket, are still at his Friend's Service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let his Friends share his Mistress! I'm afraid if his Friends applaud his Generosity, they condemn his Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Quite to the contrary, Madam, they admire his Morals; he's a well Wisher to his Country, and knows that the engrossing of any Commodity ruins Trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And is this his private Opinion, say you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Directly—Ay, 'tis so, this is some Wo∣man he keeps; and poor Soul, she's afraid when he has bought a Seat of his own, he'll not continue the Lease of her frail Tenement. <STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> But prithee, Child, why are you so inquisitive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had some Reasons, Sir, but my Scruples are much clearer, by the Discovery you have made, for I depend upon what you say for Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That you may in every thing, Madam, as cer∣tainly as that I envy my Friend the Share he holds in your Esteem: He's my Friend, 'tis true, and as such, I ought to have conceal'd his Failing — But Beauty,

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For how long, pray Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Madam, that I can't tell; but if it holds on as it begins, I believe to my Life's end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And how many Friends have you to go share, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Madam, none at all. I fancy I should play the Monopolist, were you once at my Dis∣posal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that wou'd be a Ruin to Trade; you know; you'd be reckon'd an Enemy to your Coun∣try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Od so, that's true, as you say; but no matter, I am no Member of Parliament, I have no Body's Affairs but my own upon my Hands.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So consequently fear no Petitions.</P>

<P>No, faith, Madam, I fear nothing but your Eyes.</P>

<P>I can assure you there is no Malignity in 'em; you'll be never the worse for looking at 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I positively deny that; for I find I am strangely disorder'd, and nothing but the knowing of your Name, and Lodgings, and Leave to wait on you, can prolong my Life a Moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! if you are so near Death, I'll be gone, lest I am indited for your Murther; you'd do well to pray, Sir, shall I send a Parson to you, ha, ha, ha.</P>

<P>So, she's gone — did ever any body know so cross a Jade; now has she an itching to persue the Custom of her Sex, to be talk'd of, and enquir'd after; a Pox, I have a good mind not to ask <HI>Bellmie</HI> about her, and yet I don't know what's the matter with me, I have a divelish mind to a Night's Lodging with her; but then she's my Friend's Mistress, why, what then, she's not his Wife — Egad, I am resolved to sound his Inclination, he can't be in Love in two Places at once, I am certain he is really so with <HI>Lucinda</HI> — Ay, but that's honourable Love, he may keep a Mistress for all that— but perhaps he may be weary of her, and glad to consign her over to me; Beauty's a falling Commodity, yet if the Perquisites ben't damaged, I'll accept 'em: So upon mature Consideration, I'll ask him who she is— ho, here he comes</P>

<P>Yes, faith, so she seem'd; I wish I cou'd give you a more evident Proof of it; for she's very hand∣some.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But upon what Business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The main Business, I suppose, Love, Love, Friend; she wanted you, <HI>Bellmie</HI>; and I can assure you I have done you no inconsiderable Piece of Service, if you knew all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, what is't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You know you may command any thing that is in my Power; prithee what is't?</P>

<P>A very inconsiderable thing to a Man in your Cir∣cumstances, only a Night's Lodging with your Mistress, that's all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What mean you, <HI>Octavio?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why here has been a very pretty Lady to see you, and by all Appearance she's a Mistress of yours, tho' you was never so honest as to tell your Friend your Happiness; faith <HI>Bellmie</HI>, 'twas not like a Friend to conceal an Intrigue of this nature; what! keep a Mistress and let no body know it! I'm sure I never serv'd you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! do you mean to banter me? — I keep a Mistress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, don't deny it with that grave Face, that philosophical Air won't do, Man, her Jealousie discover'd all; she wou'd fain have pump'd me out of something about <HI>Lucinda</HI>, whether you loved her or not, or did design to marry her — but thanks to
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
this projecting Brain of mine, that furnish'd me with Lies quick as my Tongue cou'd utter 'em, she remains in Ignorance; I told her you design'd no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! ods life, do you know what you have done? This must be some body from <HI>Lucinda</HI>. I have no Mistress, nor do I know any Woman breathing so intimately as to expect a Visit from her, except my Relations, who are all known to you, therefore it must be from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Oct.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, don't think I'll let that pass upon me, I expect for the Service I have done you to know where the Lady lives; yet faith and troth, <HI>Bellmie</HI>, if you will really confess you love her, the Devil take me if I at∣tempt making you a Cuckold, tho' I have, by the way, a violent Inclination; but Friendship has always had the Ascendant over my Desires yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bell.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, <HI>Octavio</HI>, what I have said is true, upon my Honour it is; and farther, I here promise to renounce all Claim whatsoever to the whole Sex, except <HI>Lucinda</HI>; will that satisfie you?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
never more mistaken in all my Life, the Devil take me if I cou'd see honest Woman writ in her Fore∣head; but hark'e, if you'll tell me where the Lady lives, I'll go and unsay all I have said.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bellm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what's to be done now, — he has promis'd to deliver me a Letter, if possible; all I can do is patiently to expect the Event: prithee do you go find out Sir <HI>Toby</HI>, and try what Discovery you can make; but be sure you don't let him know that you are acquainted with me, perhaps he may introduce you as a Friend of his, and so you may speak to <HI>Lucinda</HI> or her Cousin; which if you do, remember what you owe your Friend: But be sure you make particular Enquiry about the time, for I am resolv'd he shall not marry her whilst I can hold this —<STAGE><HI>Points to his Sword.</HI></STAGE></P>

<L>But when the Term, and Winter comes agen,</L>
<L>Bawds, Brims, and Lawyers flourish bravely then.</L>
<L>Vintners and Taylors thro' such Knavish Lives,</L>
<L>With honest Citts, and virtuous City Wives;</L>
<L>I fear (tho' wishing it might be uncivil)</L>
<L>Like Pawn-Brokers, they'll all go to the Devil:</L>
<L>The City Prentices, those upstart Beaus,</L>
<L>In short spruce Puffs, and <HI>Vigo</HI> Colour Clothes,</L>
<L>Who with a Brace of Trulls stole here to Day,</L>
<L>And muster'd up a Crown to see this Play;</L>
<L>Lewdness and Gaming will run them aground,</L>
<L>And Masters Cash fall short a hundred Pound.</L>
<L>Our upper Friends, whose Height Respect denotes,</L>
<L>Since Liv'ries too are not unlike tac'd Coats,</L>
<L>By coming will such Criticks grow at last,</L>
<L>Nothing but Standard-Wit will please their Taste,</L>
<L>Till learning here how well the Town's harangu'd,</L>
<L>They'll make ingenious Speeches when they're hang'd.</L>
<L>Our Fidlers will, be scraping as before,</L>
<L>Spend ev'ry Groat they get upon a Whore,</L>
<L>Lead merry Lives, damn'd shabby, and damn'd poor:</L>
<L>But where at last they'll go, is hard, to tell,</L>
<L>For really they're too impudent for Hell.</L>
<L>The Ladies, by their melting Looks, I see,</L>
<L>Will die for Love, perhaps for Love of me;</L>
<L>My Pity flows apace to save their Life,</L>
<L>I cou'd be kind, but must not wrong my Wife.</L>
<L>But lastly, for the Fortune of this Play,</L>
<L>Humour's a Hazard, get thus much I'll say,</L>
<L>The Author purely for your Mirth design'd it,</L>
<L>And whether good or bad, 'tis— As you find it.</L>
