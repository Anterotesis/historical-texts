<HEAD>THE
Ballance of EUROPE,
OR,
An ENQUIRY
INTO
The respective Dangers of giving the Spanish Mo∣narchy
to the Emperour, as well as to King Phi∣lip,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or this last Eight
Years of the War, seem'd to Depend
but upon one main and capital Ar∣ticle,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> The Surrendering or E∣vacuating
<HI>Spain</HI> by King <HI>Philip,</HI> to King <HI>Charles</HI>
III. and this having brought the Debates about
it, <HI>upon any Treaties that were offer'd,</HI> within a
narrower Compass than formerly, we found
the last Conferences at <HI>Gertruydenberg</HI> confin'd to
this short Head; what Security should be gi∣ven
on one Hand, and what Equivalent on the
Other, for the effectual Evacuating the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Dominions by King <HI>Philip?</HI> And upon their not
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Agreeing in this Point, that Treaty or Meeting
broke up, and the War went on purely on this
Head: If any Man equi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed what we Fought
for in this War, the Answer was short, we
Fought for <HI>Spain.</HI> All the Pretences of this
War, all the Manifestoes, Defences, or Argu∣ments
on either Side, turn'd upon this Point
only, The Evacuating <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Security
for the Performance: We could ask little of the
King of <HI>France</HI> but what he readily enough a∣greed
to, but this, and had this been heartily
either Proposed on one Hand, or Consented
to on the Other, the War had been at an End
long ago</P>
<P>But behold when we thought our Peace as
good as Concluded, and that whenever we
pleased but to offer a Proport<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on or Equivalent
to King <HI>Philip,</HI> we might at our Pleasure put
an End to the Strise; a New and unexpected
Difficulty is risen up, of so perplexing a Na∣ture,
so odd and intricate in its Circnmstances,
that even, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> should come
and say to us, that his Grandson was ready to
Evacuate <HI>Spain,</HI> to lay down his Pretensions,
and give up the Possession of the Crown, as we
formerly Desired and Demanded, we are now
uncertain whether we had best take it or no, and
if we should accept it, are still more Doubtful
to whom we should give it, or in brief <HI>what we
should do with it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
This New Doubt arises from Two Incidents
which have Interveened since the said Confe∣rences
at <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> and which humane
Prudence could then have no Prospect of. <HI>First,</HI>
The Death of the Emperour <HI>Joseph,</HI> Eldest
Branch of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and <HI>Secondly,</HI>
The Election of <HI>Char.</HI> III. (whom we called
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and in whose Name all this
War has been carry'd on) to the Imperial
Crown, by the Stile of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. Emperour
of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>By the Consequence of these unexpected E∣vents,
<HI>Europe</HI> is now acted by New Councils;
differing and inconsisting Interests rise up in the
Affairs of <HI>Christendome,</HI> the Dangers of heap∣ing
up Power upon the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which
may in time be superior to the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> be∣gin
to appear formidable and frightful; the
Nations call to mind the fatal Greatness of <HI>Cha.</HI>
V. <HI>Philip</HI> II. and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> whose Power
threaten'd <HI>Europe</HI> with universal Bondage for
several Ages, and who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e formidable Strength
took it's rise and beginning only in the Con∣junction
of the Empire with the Dominions of
<HI>Spain,</HI> in the Person of <HI>Cha.</HI> V. which, though
all the Electors consented to, Five of them had
Fifty Years Leisure to repent of.</P>
<P>It is not the least Unhappiness in the present
Dispute, that the several Parties are divided
in their Thoughts, to whom they shall allot
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy: But the Competitors
are so few, and their Circumstances so equal,
that the Question <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturns, even upon a Point
which seems very hazardous to us all, and in∣deed
looks at first sight▪ very frightfully <HI>(viz)</HI>
Whether, after all the Blood that has been
spilt, Money spent, Desolation made, Losses
sustain'd, and Perplexity suffer'd, by the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederated
Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> to gain this <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy from King <HI>Philip</HI> to King <HI>Charles,</HI>
it shall not now appear more for the publick
Safety and Interest to give it to King <HI>Philip,</HI>
whom they have been fighting against, than to
K. <HI>Charles,</HI> whom they have been fighting for:
And though this might look like a severe Sa∣tyr
upon the Wisdom and Councils of the Con∣federates
in general, who have with such Ea∣gerness
and Application been thus long Fight∣ing,
and spending their Blood and Treasure to
pull that down, which it appears their Interest
to set up, and <HI>Vice Versa,</HI> to keep that low,
which they have fought so vigorously to set up;
I mean the new Emperour: Yet all this is
accounted for, by the New and Un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreseen Ac∣cident
of the Late Emperour's dying without
Heirs Male, and the Necessity, in order to e∣stablish
the other Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> of electing
King <HI>Charles</HI> III. Emperour of <HI>Germany</HI> in his
stead.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
This Event has in many Cases alter'd the face
of Affairs, and hustling, as we may say, the
Interests of <HI>Europe</HI> together, has placed many
of them in differing Positions from what they
were before: So that New Councils, New
Dangers, New Methods of Safety, New Fa∣ces,
and a New Situation of Affairs, appear in
many Parts of the Confederacy, to some the
Dangers of setting the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> on the
Head of the Emperour seem very great and
terrible, much greater than those of setting it
on the Head of King <HI>Philip;</HI> and to some just
the contrary: To some the Dangers of the <HI>Au∣strian</HI>
Greatness are nearer, and those of <HI>Bourbon</HI>
more remote; to others the Greatness of the
House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> are nearer and more affecting,
and those of the Emperor or House of <HI>Austria</HI>
growing too powerful are more remote, and
less affrighting than that of <HI>Bourbon▪</HI> And as
the respective Branches of the Confederacy are
more or less affected with these Views, so they
are more or less interrested in the present De∣bate,
whether on one Side or another.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, this Change of Affairs
gives a New Turn to the whole Negotiation
of the Peace; and some of those, who before
were clear in the Prosecution of the War, till the
whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy should be restored to
the August House of <HI>Austria,</HI> find Reason, even
from the same upright and just Foundation
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>(viz.)</HI> The Safety and Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> to be
now quite of another Mind; believing, that if
all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy was to be given up to
the Emperour, the Ballance of Power, so much
aim'd at, would be effectually destroyed in
<HI>Europe;</HI> And that they should be so far from
establishing the Safety and the Peace they s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ek
for, that in a few Years they should be obliged
to begin a New War in <HI>Europe,</HI> to succour the
Oppressed Princes, who would be crushed and
over-powered by the Neighbourhood and En∣croachments
of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Power, which by
this Conjunction would be made too great for
them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, some, who have receiv'd
such terrible Ideas of the <HI>French</HI> Greatness, that
no Dangers that are remote can equal their
Concern for, are not only quite of another Opi∣nion,
but are too apt to reproach the other
with being unjust to their former declared
Principles, and with being brought over to
<HI>French</HI> Councils, managed by <HI>French</HI> Influence,
and the like.</P>
<P>The Author of these Sheets acknowledges
so much of his own Sentiments before-hand,
that he thinks both these may be in some mea∣sure
wrong, in the several Steps they have taken
in this great Affair, but more especially that
both are wrong, in the severe Reflections they
cast upon one another, and the Censures they
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
make, which neither one way or other seem
to open or explain the Matter, but only to
exasperate Parties, and increase the unhappy
Divisions with which this Nation has too long
already been perplex'd, And not only so, but
that these Heats are more especially Fatal at
this Time, as they may not only affect our
Parties and disturb our Private Peace, but as
they make those Divisions National, and cause
them to spread abroad among the Confederates
and Allies to make them jealous of and un∣easy
to one another. Nor is this all yet; but
the Consequences of those Jealousies and Un∣easiness
have a natural tendency to break and
blow up the present Grand Alliance against
<HI>France,</HI> upon which, and the right Application
of every Part and Party to the Interest of the
whole, depends the general Safety at this time;
since <HI>France</HI> being now brought to a Willingness
for Peace, and that upon Conditions in many
Parts very advantagious to the Confederates;
Yet we find his Power not so entirely broken,
but that, if our Misunderstandings and Un∣easiness
at Home, should be carry'd on to any
Length, fatal to the present good Understand∣ing
among the Allies, on which the Safety of
the whole Confederacy does so much depend,
and if any Rupture among us should unhappily
fall out, she would be able to take hold of it;
and make such Advantages thereof, as would
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
bid fair to restore her to all that Excess o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Power, which had made her so formidable to
<HI>Europe;</HI> and by Consequence the End of these
long Wars, which is now so happily in View,
would be effectually disappointed.</P>
<P>It cannot be an unprofitable Observation to
our Allies abroad, or to our People at home▪
to remind them, that <HI>France</HI> is by this long
War so far reduced, as that the just Occasion
for which the War was begun <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Ex∣orbitance
of his Power, seem'd to be effectual∣ly
removed. The Concessions made by the King
of <HI>France</HI> at the late Treaty, are a sufficient E∣vidence
of this; and the Conditions of the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Preliminaries are so full of the several Countrie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Cities, Towns, and strong Places, which <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
is willing to give up, as will reduce the <HI>Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Greatness to a Limitation, <HI>Europe</HI> would hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but little or no reason for the Future to call Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
orbitant.</P>
<P>But should any such Breach among the Con∣federates
happen, which God forbid, as shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
remove the Fears and Apprehensions of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Power, so that <HI>France</HI> should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all off from thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Concessions, and the Confederates should not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
far agree, as to carry on this War, or perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not be in a Condition, it would be a Questio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
few would venture to solve, when it may b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
likely to reduce <HI>France</HI> to such Concessions a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
It is to be hoped, the Sense of the Danger o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Europe</HI> in such a Case, will move the Confede∣rates
to more Noble Sentiments, than such as
may have these fatal Consequences; But as no
Caution can be too great in such a Case, so no
Man that is truly sensible, how busy some a∣mong
us are to provoke to the Disagreement a∣foresaid,
and what Hopes they entertain of the
Success of it, can avoid being filled with Fear,
and say every needful Thing to prevent it.</P>
<P>Also the Author of this Tract thinks it is a
Caution every Party ought to accept from him
with Candour and Kindness; and that they
who pretend to the least Concern for the Safety
and Tranquillity of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Prosperity of the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, or the Good of their Native
Country of <HI>Birtain,</HI> would do well to reflect,
whether the present Humour, which too much
prevails among us, of opposing the General Peace
because of their Prejudices at the Party concer∣ned
in making it, is not a thing of such ruinous
Consequence, as may in the end prevent our ha∣ving
any Peace at all, or at least dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble us from
obtaining so good Conditions as at this time
may be obtained.</P>
<P>I have heard some People run so great a
Length in Opposing the Steps now taking to∣wards
a general Treaty of Peace, as to talk of
Ways and Means to be proposed in <HI>England</HI> a∣mong
private Persons, to enable the <HI>Dutch</HI> to
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
carry on the War without us; I say, to be pro∣posed,
because I cannot but think such People▪
if any such there are, will look before them, e'r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they take such a Step, and Consider well the
Danger of it to themselves, there being generaly
Speaking, a large Interval between the For∣ming
and the Executing such dangerous At∣tempts
as these.</P>
<P>But such People have also another thing to
Consider, and which when they come to look
into, will no doubt Check their furious Zea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the Confusion of <HI>Europe,</HI> and this is, that▪
they will find the <HI>Dutch</HI> understand their Inte∣rest
better, and have a clearer Sense of things,
than to embark on so weak a View, and with
so Empty a Project of Support, as the warmth
of a few private People would be, and who as
soon as Detected in their New Scheme, would
be Treated at Home as Rebels and Traitors▪
even by a Government, which nevertheless
would be Assistant to the same Nation, which
these would pretend to Support in an illega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and irregular Way: But of this I shall speak
more largely when I come to the Particulars.</P>
<P>But to return to the present Case, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The
new Debates as to the Interest of Disposing the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, on this unforeseen Event
of the Death of the Emperour, it is observeable
that till now, it had been a Question only be∣tween
the King of <HI>France</HI> and his Grandson,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
King <HI>Philip,</HI> on the one Side, and the Conse∣derates
on the other; who should possess the
Monarchy of <HI>Spain.</HI> Nay it had not been a
Question there either, but the King of <HI>France</HI>
had Conceded it to <HI>Char.</HI> III. by the Prelimi∣naries
adjusted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and after at <HI>Ger∣truydenberg,</HI>
only Contending for some little
hold of it, that his Grandson King <HI>Philip,</HI> might
not fall a Rent Charge upon his Hands, and be∣come
a Refuge in his Court among other So∣vereigns,
that have fled thither for Sanctuary;
but might remain a King, tho' but with a small
Dominion, little better than the Name; for
<HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> was the Sum of his De∣mands,
with the few <HI>Spanish</HI> Towns on the
Coast of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> which they afterwards rece∣ded
from too.</P>
<P>But upon this New Occasion of the Death
of the Late Emperour <HI>Joseph,</HI> the Dispute hath
extended it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into divers Branches; and it is
now an E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiry among the Confederates too,
and perhaps an Enquiry more Difficult to be
Answer'd than it was before; to whom shall
the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> be allotted by a Treaty
of Peace?</P>
<P>I shall as exactly as Publick Notice of such
things will permit, give a short Sketch of the
Opinions of other People about it, and then sub∣join
what occurs to immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Observation,
Fortifying it with such Reasons, as the Circum∣stances
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
of the Case may offer; and allowing as
due a Weight, and as just a Regard, to the se∣veral
Arguments used in this Case, as I would
have allowed to my own.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Some People are positive for giving the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to the Emperour <HI>Ch.</HI> VI.
without taking any Umbrage at his Greatness▪
they say the Circumstances of the Empire differ
from what they were in the Days of <HI>Char.</HI> the
Vth. That the rest of the World are in a bet∣ter
Condition to curb him in an undue Exercise
of his Power. That the vast Extent of his Do∣minions
will be so far from giving him an Ex∣orbitance
of Power, that they render that Power
Unweildy, and a Burthen to it self; That the
Dominionly so separated and extended, una∣ble
to Help and Relieve one another, that like
a Whale among Islands, or in Shoals, when
struck by the Harpineers, he beats himself to
Pieces for want of Sea Room. That in the
Days of <HI>Char.</HI> Vth neither <HI>Holland</HI> was a State,
or <HI>France</HI> in any Figure; nor was there any
Naval Power Superiour to the Emperour;
whereas now should the Emperour attack any
of them all, either <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
are able to cut off his Comunication with
the <HI>Indies;</HI> nay even with <HI>Spain</HI> it self, and
with all the Islands; so that the Power of the
Empire is nothing to what it then was. This
and much more, make up what they allege
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Others are for giving, <HI>Spain</HI> to the
Emperour meerly because it shou'd not come
into the Hands of the House of <HI>Bourbone.</HI> They
know by general Notion, that it is an allow'd
Principle, and a Fundamental, in the Case of
the present War, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy
must not whatever comes of it, fall into the
Hands of <HI>France.</HI> They know no Difference be∣tween
<HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, and his Grandson <HI>Philip;</HI> they
know very well the absolute Command that
Great Monarch has over his Subjects of every
Degree, not excepting his Grandson <HI>Philip;</HI>
they know that mighty Obligation which <HI>Philip</HI>
V. is under to his Grandfather; that to him he
Owes his being, Called to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne;
that his Grandfather not only set him up, but
has kept him in Possession of that Monarchy al∣most
at the Expence of his own; at least at the
Expence of many Thousands of his Subjects, and
many Millions of his Treasure: He must be
Ingrateful to the highest Degree, if he can for∣get
such Obligations, the greatest that one Man
can heap upon another; and enhanced with
such Particulars to make it yet greater, that no
Prince ever did more for another, even almost
to his own Ruin, and to the Ruin of his Sub∣jects;
and therefore they cannot but think the
Persons and Interests will ever be the same. That
<HI>Philip</HI> V. will ever own his Crown to his Grand∣father,
and be Subjected so far to his Rules, Or∣dering,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and Requests; that as it respects us the
Consederates, it must be reckoned the same
thing Effectually and Eventually, to give the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to King <HI>Philip,</HI> as to give it
to the King of <HI>France;</HI> and for this Reason, they
are for the Concession of the Whole, to be made
to the Emperour; not but that they are Con∣vinced
it may be Dangerous so to do, but be∣cause
they think it is the least Mischief of the
Two, and that the other way it must Inevita∣bly
come to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Others are neither for giving it to one
or other, but Reviving the Old and Exploded
Notion of a <HI>Partition,</HI> are for Dividing it, some
to one Hand some to another; so by that means
to weaken the Whole, and take from <HI>Europe</HI> the
Apprehension of Danger, from it, one way or o∣ther.
They alledge that if it should be given
to King <HI>Philip,</HI> there is a manifest Danger to
<HI>Europe,</HI> from the strict Union there is between
him and his Grandfather the King of <HI>France;</HI> that
they will be always in one and the same Inte∣rest,
tho' they should enter into never so many
Engagements to the Contra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; that there are
many concurring Accidents which may serve
to Unite them more closely than ever, and some
things may so fall out, that may, <HI>in Time,</HI> Re∣volve
them into one Hand, as they are already
in one Intrest; that the Risque is too great
while under but a bare Possibility, that <HI>Europe</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
can never be Easy, while such Possibility is in
the remotest View, and that the Confederates
having now the Power in their Hands, ought to
deliver themselves and their Posterity from the
Apprehensions, and even from the Possibility
of such a Consequence. On the other Hand they
they tell us▪ that to give the Dominions of <HI>France</HI>
to the Emperour, is full of Dangers, equal in
Consequence, and nearer in View than the o∣ther.
Nay, tho' the Evil apprehended of an
Union with <HI>France</HI> should come to pass: They
ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to mind the formidable Greatness of the
House of <HI>Austria</HI> in the Days of <HI>Charles</HI> V. what the
Dangers to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Princes were, even in
his Reign, and afterwards in the Reign of <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>'
II. one of his Successors: They look upon
the History of the Low-Country Wars, and the
Cruelty of the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI>
where 18000 People were in Twelve Years
space executed by the Hand of the Common
Hang-man, they look into the Massacres of the
<HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and in <HI>Italy,</HI>
and at last to the Attempt made by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II.
to cause all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Princes in <HI>Germany</HI> to
restore the Ecclesiastick Immunities Possess'd by
them from the Reformation. They infer from
hence, that to trust the same Power into the hands
of the same Politick Person, is to lay the Founda∣tion
of the Practise; they represent to themselves
the Affairs of Religion in a much weaker Posture
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
now, on the Side of <HI>Germany</HI> than it was then,
and indeed, in this they have too much Reason,
as I shall Examine more at large by and by;
and that the Attempt being once made, there is
not a sufficient Strength to Oppose them; and
for this, and many other Reasons too long to be
Inserted here, they Insist upon it, that it must
be very Dangerous, to put the Dominions of
<HI>Spain</HI> into such Hands. From either of these
Extremes, they alledge the only safe Medium
is to be taken, which is a Partition, and they fill
the World▪ with the variety of their Schemes u∣pon
this Head, with their Reasons for them, and
the State of the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> upon such a
Foot; alledging that by such a Division only, the
Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> is to be Preserved, and the Pow∣er
taken out of the Hands of either Party, to
Oppress or Grow too Great for the rest; it
would be too long, and exclude the more Pro∣fitable
Observations, which we shall fill up this
Tract with, to give here the Variety of Schemes
the Projection of this Partition lays down, as
the Ground-Plat of the Publick Peace; it may
suffice, that they go all upon this main Point:
That the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy should thereby be
rendred so weak, that to whose Share soever it
may fall, it may not be such an Addition of
Strength to them, as to make them too Power∣ful
for the rest of <HI>Christendom,</HI> a Foundation no
Question formed upon right Principles: Whe∣ther
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
a Partition of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions be
the only necessary Consequence, or the only
effectual Means to bring that End proposed to
pass, or no, is a Question to be treated of by it
self.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured here with all possible
Clearness to lay down, what every Opinion a∣mong
us pretend to desire, and what Reasons
they give for their several Schemes; but I can∣not
dismiss this Part of my Work, till I have
observed a little upon the Deficience of every
one of these. <HI>For Example;</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The People who are for giving the Do∣minions
of <HI>Spain</HI> to King <HI>Philip</HI> do not dwell
much upon the particular Security which may
be given for the Ease of the Confederates against
<HI>France,</HI> and against the Possibility of <HI>Spain</HI> being
once united to <HI>France</HI> by right of Devolution,
or being under the Influence of <HI>France</HI> in Mat∣ters
of Council and Commerce; nor do they
tell us what is, or what is not sufficient for the
Confederates to depend upon, as Security in
such a Case: which, as it seems not to be a
Thing impracticable in it self, so neither was it
unnecessary to be annex'd to their Opinion of
giving <HI>Spain</HI> to a Branch of the House of <HI>Bour∣bon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI>
Those who are for giving <HI>Spain,</HI> with
all the Dominions thereto belonging, to the Em∣peror,
have, with all their Reasons for doing
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
so, and the Dangers of leaving it to the Posses∣sion
of <HI>France,</HI> forgotten in the first Place, to let
us know how they intend to get them out of
the Possession of <HI>Philip</HI> V. They omit nothing
that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> at the First En∣trance
upon this last Breach, publickly own'd
and acknowledg'd King <HI>Philip,</HI> and sent Am∣bassadors
to compliment him upon his Accessi∣on
to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne: That by this Act
they led the People of <HI>Spain</HI> to a general recei∣ving
him, and giving their Faith, Homage,
and Allegiance to him, as their lawful King.
What such an Action would have been called
by us, had the King of <HI>France</HI> done it, I forbear
to inquire into here. The Case for which it is
mentioned here, is only to note, that having
encouraged the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation by this Proceed∣ing
to receive and crown King <HI>Philip,</HI> no doubt
it has been the more difficult from that very
Occasion, to bring them back again at Plea∣sure
to swear Alledgiance to another, meerly
because we think fit to set him up and support
him.</P>
<P>The Possession King <HI>Philip</HI> has thus gain'd,
has been twice, <HI>if not, as we may say, three times</HI>
unsuccessfully attempted; and though that
Monarch has been obliged two several Times
to abandon his Capital, and fly from <HI>Madrid;</HI>
yet Heaven has as often seem'd to favour his
Cause, and the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederates have been in their
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Turns by plain Force obliged to quit the Field,
and retreat even withing the Gates of <HI>Barcelona.</HI>
Nor has this been without infinite Expence of
Blood in two Battles; the First at <HI>Almanza,</HI>
where the whole Confederate Army was over∣thrown
with such a Slaughter, and so com∣pleat
a Victory, as exceeds, in Proportion to
the Number of Troops, any Battel of this Age,
not <HI>Blenheim</HI> it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excepted; The other at <HI>Bri∣huega</HI>
and <HI>Villa Viciosa;</HI> which may be called
but one Action; where, whatever Pretences
Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> made to a Victory, 'tis evi∣dent
the Confederate Army was in a Manner
ruin'd, Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> obliged to quit the
whole Kingdom of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and made his Re∣treat
not into <HI>Catalonia</HI> only, but as was said
above, to the very Walls of <HI>Barcelona;</HI> where
if he was not besieged and driven to Sea, both
he and King <HI>Charles</HI> III. with all their Court
and Adherents, it was more owing to the ill
Condition of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Affairs, than any
Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e they were in to defend themselves; ha∣ving
neither Troops to fight, Magazines of Arms
or Ammunition, Provisions to seed them, or Mo∣ney
to pay them; and this for five Months
after their Retreat: So that Count <HI>Staremberg</HI>
was heard to say, That if the Duke <HI>de Vendosme</HI>
should attack him in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he must be
obliged to kill all the Horses, and salt them up
for the Garrisons Provision, or starve; And
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
that if a Supply of Provisions should be sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, unless he had Troops also to encamp
without the Walls, the Horse must all be ship∣ped
for <HI>Minorca,</HI> or they would eat one ano∣ther,
since it could not be supposed the Maga∣zines
of Forrage, necessary for their Subsistence
in a Siege, could he preserv'd from the Ene∣mies
Bombs.</P>
<P>It is true that a general Answer to this In∣quiry
is given by saying, That to push the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in <HI>Flanders</HI> effectually, is to reduce <HI>France</HI> to a
Necessity of evacuating <HI>Spain;</HI> that the Road
to <HI>Madred</HI> lies thro' the Gates of <HI>Paris;</HI> and that
as this is the only Step which reduced the King
of <HI>France</HI> to make such Concessions as he has
already made, so it is a Proof that there is an
effectual Method to bring him to a Necessity
of giving up all the rest. This indeed has been
the popular Reason given for carrying on the
War so long as it has been; and is the Argu∣ment
now made use of to justify the Breaking
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f of the Last Treaty, when <HI>France</HI> came in
to the evacuating <HI>Spain,</HI> and offer'd a Sum of
Money towards carrying on the War against
King <HI>Philip</HI> if he insisted upon his Refusal to
quit it: But whether, when we talk of these
things with so much Assurance, we are not a
little guilty of what in our Enemies we call <HI>The
Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conade,</HI> ought also to be consider'd; since,
instead of being at the Gates of <HI>Paris,</HI> we have
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
pass'd another <HI>Campaign</HI> with taking one Pal∣try
Town; have lost a small Army by Deser∣tion
of our Troops. And tho' in <HI>Spain</HI> we have
sent above 20000 Men for Succours to King
<HI>Charles,</HI> they are now insulted in their Intrench∣ments,
and are not able to act upon the Offen∣sive
in any one Article.</P>
<P>So that these People seem to be over forward
in giving the Kingdoms of <HI>Spain</HI> out of the Pos∣sion
of K. <HI>Philip</HI> by a Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y▪ while they do not
first tell us how we shall get it out of his hand
by a War.</P>
<P>Nor do they consider the Confederates as in
the least weaken'd or exhausted by the War. I
care not to say in publick, what I think of our
Difficulties, and how ill able we are in this Na∣tion
to carry on the War any farther; but it
need not be an Offence to any one to have it
said, That the <HI>French</HI> are not the only Nation
in <HI>Europe</HI> who stand in need of a Peace, espe∣cially
as Matters go at home; which leads me
by the Hand to an Observation of an unhappy
Circumstance in <HI>England,</HI> which more parti∣cularly
justifies those who appear earnest for a
Peace (<HI>viz.</HI>) That those very People who ap∣pear
most forward against a Peace, and seem
to abound in their own Reasons for it, are yet
the very People who, by discouraging Loans,
running down Stocks, and ruining the National
Credit, endeavour most effectually to disable

<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
<HI>3dly,</HI> To come to the Deficiences of their
Schemes, who are for the Partition of the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Monarchy in general: I cannot here enter
upon particular Objections against their several
Schemes, because I have not enumerated those
Schemes, nor is it much to the purpose so to do:
But the main Objections I meet with are (1)
That the Emperour will not be brought to ac∣cept
of such a Treaty; and you must break in
upon the Treaty of Grand Alliance to compel
him to do so: And (2) As Matters now stand,
you will never come to a right Agreement of
such a Partition, because <HI>France</HI> and King <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>
will never part with the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor can the
Emperour have them without Old <HI>Spain</HI> an∣nex'd.</P>
<P>Having
just touch'd upon these things, with
all humble Deference to the Opinions of every
side, which, according the best of my Under∣standing,
I have laid fairly down; I shall now
lay down, in Terms that may be intelligible to
the meanest Understanding, a true and impar∣tial
State of the present Affairs of <HI>Europe:</HI> How
and in what manner a Peace may be establish∣ed
with Safety and Honour to the whole, and
upon what Foot the several Powers now enga∣ged
in a long and bloody War, may be brought
to what we so often talk of, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>A Ballance of Europe.</HEAD>
<P>The Reader one would think, need not be
told that <HI>Europe</HI> here is to be taken in a strict
Sense, for those Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> who are con∣cern'd
in the present War with <HI>France,</HI> on one
side or other; without concerning our selves
with the Affairs of <HI>Sweden</HI> or <HI>Muscovy, Hungary</HI>
or the <HI>Turks,</HI> which tho' it is True they are in
<HI>Europe,</HI> yet as this is the governing Part of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
it has been a Word Legitimated to this
Part by the Custom of the Times.</P>
<P>The present War as it respects our Discourse,
is carried on by five principal Heads of Confe∣deracy;
the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> known by the Name of the Two
Crowns make one Side. The Emperour, <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
and the States General make the other, and
it needs not for any Light that it will give to
our Discourse, that we should enumerate the
Kings of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI>
or the Electors of the Empire on one Side,
or the Empire of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> on the other,
only as Accidents to our Discourse.</P>
<P>It is a certain Truth, That all the Confede∣rates
have Exerted themselves in this War with
an uncommon Vigour.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has given convincing Proofs to the
World, how well Furnished she was for the
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Government of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that she had a Foun∣dation
of Strength sufficient to support the high∣est
Prospect she had in View of Universal Mo∣narchy;
since she has str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggled single Handed
against the strongest and best cemented Confe∣deracy
that was ever known in this, or in any
Part of the World. That she has been so far
from receiving any Assistance from her Confe∣deracy
with <HI>Spain,</HI> that she has twice by her
proper Forces, retrived <HI>Spain</HI> from the Hands
of the Victorious Arms of the Confederates, and
given Victory to K. <HI>Philip,</HI> Restoring him twice
to his Throne, from which he was evidently
Driven without any View of Recovery, but by
the Arms of <HI>France.</HI> On both these Occasions
<HI>France</HI> has ravish'd Victory from the Confede∣rates,
Beaten them by fair Fighting out of the
Field, and Driven them back, as is Noted be∣fore,
to the Gates of <HI>Barcelona</HI> taking from them
after the First B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttel, the City o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tortosa,</HI> and
after the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, the strong Fortress of <HI>Gironne.</HI></P>
<P>This is a convincing Justification of the Con∣federa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es▪
for their Undertaking this War, since
it proves b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yond any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ction, that it was

<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
However, the Confederacy has been also
built upon such solid Foundations, so well knit
together, their Affairs so heartily push'd on in
the Field, and the <HI>French</HI> have received so ma∣ny
Blows: That in two Treaties, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The
First at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where Preliminaries were set∣tled,
and the Last at <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> where the
Security only of Performance was Discussed.
The King of <HI>France</HI> came so low, as to offer to
restore to the Confederates more in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
than was ever Demanded by any former Treaty,
and Proportion in other Parts, and in particu∣lar,
condescended to the Evacuation of all <HI>Spain,</HI>

they should shut their Eyes against such Propo∣sals
as these, I am not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough to de∣termine;
indeed it appears to me as if the whole
was under some Malignity not yet understood.
No doubt Providence in Justice to the Sins of
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
<HI>Europe,</HI> closed the Understandings of the Politi∣cians
of those Times, that they could not see
the things which belonged to their Peace; for
after all these Concessions, they rejected the Pro∣posal
as Unsatisfactory, and ventur'd the Suc∣cess
of another War, (as we may call it) ra∣ther
than to put an End so Glorious, to the Trou∣bles
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It was not many Days after this, when <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI>
who had first (as on may lawfully doubt)
Infatuated them to reject Peace, declared a∣gainst
them in the War, and the Confederate
Army suffer'd a Disgrace at <HI>Briheuga</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI>
This was followed with a Battle, so far from
being an Advantage to us on that Side, that it
was followed with the Loss of all the Conquests
made in the Beginning of the Campaign, and
with the Retreat of the Confederates to the
Walls of <HI>Barcelona.</HI> This encouraged the Ene∣my
to reject your Proposals of any kind, sue no
more for Peace, and on every Side to threaten
you with an Offensive War: Nor were they be∣hind
Hand with us in their real appearing in
the Field, being near 20000 Men Superiour in
Number to us in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and in Proportion e∣very
where else.</P>
<P>But Providence ended not here, for having
scattered the Confederate Army in <HI>Spain,</HI> the
Embarrassing their Councils, follow'd in an
unexpected Blow upon their Affairs, which has
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
cut out Work for our Politicians, which few
y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t can see the End of. This was the unexpe∣cted
Death of the Emperour, to the Surprize
of both Parties.</P>
<P>The first Step taken by the Confederates upon
this Event, was to declare their Resolutions to
nominate the King of <HI>Spain, Char.</HI> III. to the
Empire, and as far as Possible to influence the
several Electors to chuse him, and this Part has
succeeded.</P>
<P>All the use <HI>France</HI> made of this Juncture, has
been to oblige the Allies to recal Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>
and about 14000 of the Confederate Troops,
from the Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to serve on the
<HI>Rhine,</HI> in order to prevent the Elector of <HI>Bava∣ria</HI>
with the <HI>French</HI> Army on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> Inva∣ding
the Empire, and pushing into <HI>Bavaria</HI> with
the <HI>French,</HI> made a great Noise and Appearance
of Undertaking, but intended nothing less.</P>
<P>When the News of the Death of the Emperor
came to be seriously weighed in the several
Courts of <HI>Christendome,</HI> the Effects it had there,
were as various as the several Interests of those
Princes guided them; nor had the Confederates
every where the same Sentiments. I have not
room here to enlarge upon the particular Poli∣ticks
of every respective Court, and the Measures
taken or resolved to be taken thereupon, only
thus far I may be particular.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
The <HI>Dutch,</HI> tho' with their aims no doubt
at a good Peace, spoke <HI>A-la-Cavalier,</HI> talk'd
big and threatn'd nothing but War; all their
Discourses were of carrying on the War with
Vigour, speedy recruiting their Troops, posting
their whole Army on the Frontiers, and in the
conquer'd Towns, raising new Magazines of
Forrage; reducing the Princes of the <HI>North</HI> to
a Peace, the better to carry on the War against
<HI>France and the like.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>English</HI> Court, whether it were that
they had then concerted it with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or
whether it was that they saw further into their
own Affairs than other People thought they did,
discover'd different Sentiments: They foresaw
that the Death of the Emperour would produce
other Events in <HI>Europe,</HI> than might yet appear;
that all the Issue of carrying on the War, could
but be one of these two hard Cases, either by
any Disadvantage in the Field, to make <HI>France</HI>
lift up her self, and refuse to concede the same
Articles of Peace she had already o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer'd; or by
pushing <HI>France</HI> to the Extremity, cause her to
evacuate the Dominions of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Empe∣rour,
and whether that would add to <HI>Europes</HI>
Peace at last, it might not be in the Reach of

the main moving Reasons, why the <HI>British</HI>
Court appeard at least more enclined to a Trea∣ty
than some other of the Allies; I name none,
this being written rather to explain things at
home, than give Offence abroad.</P>
<P>I need not run on here to tell you, that the

both sides, relating to the Affair, My Lord
<HI>Str—rd,</HI> Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary to the
States General, is sent over to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to
lay the whole Matter open to the States.</P>
<P>From these Proceedings the several Speculati∣ons
of the Times are derived, which these Sheets
are calculated a little to regular, and a little to
cut short some People, who run too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast from
Information to Observation, and from Obser∣vation
to Reflection; and in all perhaps un∣just
and imprudent.</P>
<P>The First Objection we meet with is, That
these Negotiations, as they call them, are pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore what they call clandestine. But
this is answer'd, <HI>First,</HI> By saying that all these
Negotiations amount to no more than receiv∣ing
Proposals from the Enemy as is said; and <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
By asking whether it is not as fair and
above-board, honourable and consistent with
the Grand Alliance (the eighth Article where∣of
they make so much Noise about) that we
may, or doreceive Proposals of Peace from the
<HI>French,</HI> and communicate them to the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
as that the <HI>Dutch</HI> should receive Proposals of
Peace from the <HI>French,</HI> and communicate them
to us.</P>
<P>Some who say that is not a sufficient An∣swer,
alledge, That the <HI>French</HI> Agent, Monsieur—has
been kept here some time, and seve∣ral
Conferences have been had with him, which
are not communicated to the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Now, as
this is a Suggestion not yet proved, it cannot
receive a particular Answer: But this might
serve to stop the Mouth of that Suggestion:
Suppose the same Agent <HI>was once</HI> entertain'd
three Months in <HI>Holland</HI> upon the same Subject,
and that before the late Treaty there was pro∣ced;
and the <HI>English</HI> were never made ac∣quainted
with it by the <HI>Dutch</HI> at all: Was the
Effect of the Private Conferences with him
there, any thing the more to our Prejudice for
that? Or do do we esteem the Treaty ever the
more broken for that? And if either of these
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
things be true, or not true; while the Result
of all is made publick to the Confederates, why
should we amuse our selves with it?</P>
<P>But as we begin to be silenc'd in the Affair of
a clandestine Negotiation, we open the wider on
the Subject of the Treaty it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and say we
are entring into an Unsafe, Inglorious, Disho∣nourable
Peace; that we will give up <HI>Spain,</HI>
which is the thing we have been fighting so
long for: That to give <HI>Spain</HI> to King <HI>Philip</HI> is
giving it to King <HI>Lewis;</HI> and that to give it to
him is to make him Universal Monarch: That
the End of the War is defeated; the great Ar∣ticle,
for which so much Blood has been spilt,
is given up: That this is betraying the Confe∣deracy,
abandoning the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> sa∣crificing
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, and the like.</P>
<P>These are fair Pretences indeed, as to the Go∣vernment:
What measures they may take, it
is not for me, or any Writer of a Pamphlet to
say. But that nothing of this Matter is yet seen
in the Government Proceedings, or any thing
like it, is manifest; nothing at all being yet
done by Her Majesty, or her Ministers, but
just hearing the Proposals which <HI>France</HI> has
made, and communicating them to be consi∣der'd
of by the Allies; and this is done so pub∣blick
and so above-board, that not only the Al∣lies
have them, but every News-paper has prin∣ted
them; they are handed about Street, and
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
the wise Sentiments of our Politicians are heard
of them every Day.</P>
<P>This is the farthest that Matter of Fact can
extend, because it is the farthest that any thing
yet has been done; yet since our Common Peo∣ple,
or at least those who endeavour to ani∣mate
them against the present Ministry, are so
warm against this part of a Treaty, it may not
be amiss to state the Case here as it relates to
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, and to that great Que∣stion,
who it shall be allotted to by the ensuing
Treaty.</P>
<P>There are but Two Competitors for it in the
World at this time: It had been to be wish'd
there were more to claim it. The Competitors
are <HI>Charles</HI> VI now Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
by us declar'd King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> V.
Grandson of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and by both
us <HI>England</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mark that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> acknow∣ledged
and owned as King of <HI>Spain</HI> As to the
King of <HI>France,</HI> he has not only, in the Old Trea∣ty
of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> renounc'd it, but in his New
Proposals for a Treaty he owns it is not safe for
<HI>Europe</HI> that it should be annex'd to the Crown of
<HI>Spain;</HI> and, in short, does not pretend to it.</P>
<P>It remains then as the only Question, to whom
it shall be allotted. All those who are for car∣rying
on the War, are among those hinted at
before, who are for giving it entirely to the
Emperour, without any regard to that Breach
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
of the Ballance of <HI>Europe,</HI> which must be the
Consequence. It is needless to set down here
the Kingdoms which an Emperour of <HI>Germany</HI>
and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> centering in one Person, would
possess; it is enough to say, that such a Prince,
being himself of a Martial Genius, Forward,
and Ambitious, would be more likely to oppress
and over-run <HI>Europe</HI> by far now, than either
of those Princes in the same Nation were, be∣fore
him, who actually did it; or than the K.
of <HI>France</HI> ever yet was, or than the K. of <HI>France,</HI>
as now reduced, could be in a hundred Years,
though <HI>Spain</HI> were to be added to him.</P>
<P>Nor is it very material to look back into the
Management of those Emperours, who have
builded upon the Union of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Domi∣nions,
any further than this, to tell you that e∣ven
<HI>France</HI> it self was summon'd in by all the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Princes, to prevent the <HI>Austrian</HI> Mo∣narch
over-running <HI>Europe,</HI> at least three or
four times; and all had not done neither, if <HI>Gu∣stavus
Adolphus,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> had not at
last finished the Ruin of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Tyranny,
and put the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> in such a condi∣tion
to assert their own Liberties, as ended in
the Famous Treaties of <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Westphalia,</HI>
which are the constituted Foundations of all the
present Treaties of <HI>Europe,</HI> that relate to the
Empire, <HI>France, Holland, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Swedland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
It might not indeed be altogether useless to
enumerate a few of the Bloody Effects of the
Cruelty and Tyranny of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness
in those Days; not in the least to reflect upon
his Imperial Majesty that now is, whose Perso∣nal
Vertues and particularly his Clemency, Ju∣stice,
and Piety are remarkably Eminent; but
we are in this speaking by way of just Caution
to Futurity; it is no Reproaching the August
House of <HI>Austria,</HI> much less the present Illustri∣ous
Branch of that House who possesses the Im∣perial
Throne, to relate what Authentick Hi∣story
has recorded, for us and future Ages to
look back upon; or to suggest, that there may
arise in after Ages, Princes upon that Throne,
who not Inheriting the Vertues and Modera∣tion
of his present Imperial Majesty, may Ex∣ercise
that Power to that Oppression and Ruin
of the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to the Destruction
of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest.</P>
<P>History gives us Three Periods when the
<HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness, was exerted to the Oppres∣sion
of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, and of the Liber∣ties
of the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> I shall but name them,
referring to History for the fuller Account of the
Particulars, in every one of which, such Dan∣gers
may appear, as may be a sufficient War∣ning
to any <HI>Protestant</HI> Nation, against being as∣sistant
in any Manner, to raise again such a
Monster in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
1. The First was in the Resolution openly
declared by <HI>Char.</HI> V. Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> against the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion in
<HI>Germany:</HI> The Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> had made se∣veral
Decrees and Resolutions, to the Prejudice
of the <HI>Protestants;</HI> which occasioned the famous
Treaty of <HI>Smalcalde,</HI> in the Year 1546. The
Emperour held a Dyet at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> where he
proposed that the <HI>Protestants</HI> should submit to
the Decrees of the Council of <HI>Trent;</HI> which they
refused and the Emperour taking upon him; the
<HI>Crusado,</HI> as it might well be called, Arms against
them. The War begun with great Fury, and
the <HI>Protestants</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Mulbergh</HI> were
ruin'd in it; the Great Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> taken, and
used most Barbarously in Prison, Insulted and
Deposed: The Landgrave of <HI>Hess Cassel</HI> Con∣demn'd
to perpetual Imprisonment, after a Ca∣pitulation
for his Liberty. The Blood, the De∣vastation,
the Cruelty and Rapins committed
in this Religious War are inexpressible, and if
<HI>Francis</HI> the First of <HI>France</HI> had not Interposed,
and God struck the Emperour with Sickness, the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Religion in all probability, had been
Extirpated in <HI>Germany,</HI> as it indeed was in the
End, in <HI>Bohemia, Austria, Moravia.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Second Attempt against the <HI>Prote∣stant</HI>
Religion, was in the Time of <HI>Philip</HI> II.
the Son of that Emperour; whose Greatness de∣riv'd
from that fatal Union of <HI>Germany</HI> with
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
<HI>Spain;</HI> and this was, the Introducing the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Inquisition into the Low Countries. This
gave Birth to that famous War in the Low
Countries, which ended by God's good Provi∣dence
in the Liberty of five Provinces, which
are now the States General, and in removing
the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI> and the Inquisition. How
be it, this was not finish'd under Forty Years
War, in the first Part of which, the Cruelty,
the Butchery, and the Murthering in cold Blood
the Prime Nobility, and Citizens of that Coun∣try,
was such, as can scarce meet with a Para∣lel
in the <HI>Christian</HI> World, for an Account of
which, the Reader is referr'd to that excellent
Historian <HI>Famianus Strada,</HI> who tho'a <HI>Papist,</HI>
speaks of it with utmost Abhorrence.</P>
<P>I omit here the Attempt of the same <HI>Philip</HI>
II. to extirpate the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion in <HI>En∣gland</HI>
by his famous Invasion of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>88, as also
his several Attempts against the <HI>Protestants</HI> of
<HI>France</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> IV. not that they were
not eminent Instances of this thing, but because
they are too long for this Tract.</P>
<P>3. The Third Period of <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness,
and its Attack upon the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion was
in the Reign of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. Emperour of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
when the <HI>Protestants</HI> were reduced to
the lowest Ebb, by the famous General <HI>Tilly;</HI>
when <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> was taken by Storm, barba∣rously
Sack'd and Burnt, and 17000 People,
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Men, Women and Children put to the Sword,
without Respect to Age, Sex, or Condition,
all the Princes of the <HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> were re∣duced
and obliged to renounce the Conclusions
of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and the Emperour had Issued out
his Decrees Imperial to oblige all the <HI>Protestants</HI>
in the whole Empire, to give up all the Chur∣ches
and Ecclesiastick Immunites to the <HI>Pa∣pists.</HI>
Victorious <HI>Tilly,</HI> had ravaged <HI>Hessia</HI> and
<HI>Thur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> was marching to reduce the Ele∣ctors
of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and was al∣ready
enter'd <HI>Saxony,</HI> where he was met by
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at the famous Plains of <HI>Leip∣sick,</HI>
and entirely overthrown; from which Bat∣tle,
the <HI>German</HI> Liberty dates its Restoration,
and in the Process of which War, the <HI>Austrian</HI>
Greatness was effectualy reduced.</P>
<P>And shall we now be blam'd, that we are
not willing to restore this Exorbitant Great∣ness
to the House of <HI>Austria!</HI> The Wars of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
if the Accounts Printed in <HI>Germany</HI> are
to be depended upon, laid Wast at several times
Two Third Parts of the Empire, destroy'd
Seven Millions of People, and lasted from the
Years 1617 to 1648, when all that Breach was
Healed in the famous Treaty of <HI>Westphalta.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the giving <HI>Spain</HI> to the House
of <HI>Auctria,</HI> come we now to Enquire into the
probable Consequences of giving the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy to <HI>Philip</HI> V. who now Possesses it.
<PB N="23" REF="39"/>
It is not for me to say, that by a War we may▪
or may not recover it from him, in spight of all
the Opposition both he and his Grandfather
can make, I will not doubt our future Success
any more than we have had reason to doubt
our past.</P>
<P>But if after we should have done this, and
have brought the King of <HI>France</HI> to consent en∣tirely
to an Evacuation, we should then find
it as dangerous to give it to the Person we con∣quer
it for, as to leave it with the Person we
have conquered it from; what account shall
we give either to God or our Posterity for the
Blood and Treasure spent in this War?</P>
<P>This is an Argument which will at least make
it worth our while to consider, as we go on,
what we are doing, or rather before we go on,
what we are going about: And this I really take
to be the true Reason why the present Govern∣ment
of this Nation are for a Treaty at this
time; and I must acknowledge it is a Testi∣mony
to me beyoud any I have seen, that the
Persons now at the Helm go upon Principles of
Justice and Prudence; if I Wrong them I shall
be very sorry for their own sakes; I am sure I
do not flatter them.</P>
<P>If, when we should have conquer'd <HI>Spain,</HI> it
may not be safe to give it up into the hands we
fight for: For God's sake, Good People, what
do we make War for? Is this Nation so rich,
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
so great, so at ease, that we want to make war
meerly to spend our Money and destroy our
Men! Shall we fight for <HI>Spain</HI> to give it back
again to them we take it from? It is much more
to the purpose to consider this before-hand.</P>
<P>It seems plain from what has been said, it
may be very hazardous to give it to the House
of <HI>Austria;</HI> let us then inquire if it may be safe
to give it to him that has it.</P>
<P>The Objections are confin'd to these two; 1.
He is an Heir, tho' remote to the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> and may come to be Next Heir. 2. He
is in the Interest of <HI>France;</HI> and to give it to him
is to give it to <HI>France.</HI> For the first of these,
That he is an Heir; it is so remote, that it is
really not worth mentioning, since his Elder
Brother is alive, and has a Son alive, and his
Wife with Child young and breeding more.
To which may be added no Doubt, a Renun∣ciation
in Favour of his younger Brother the
Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> And tho' 'tis true, the Renun∣ciation
of Kingdoms is not esteemed very signi∣ficant
in Princes, who have power to act against
them; and this might be a good Argument from
<HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain;</HI> yet it will hardly hold in arguing
from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> because there is not equal
Danger from a Weak Prince and Kingdom to a
Strong, as there is from a Stronger to a Weak∣er.
Again; as K. <HI>Philip</HI> has a Son, there is no
room for a Suggestion of a like nature in the
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
Succession of <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The next, and indeed the only Argument of
Weight, is that of Interest, thus; That the
Obligations of K. <HI>Philip</HI> to the K. of <HI>France</HI> are
indissoluble: such as, besides the Ties of Na∣ture,
the Obligation of owing his Crown to
him, as he not made him King only, but twice
replac'd him there when driven away by his
Enemies; and indeed the carrying on a War
principally for him, at the Expence of so many
Millions, and in a Kind at the Hazard of his
whole Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I will freely own these are deep Debts,
strong Obligations; and in Honour and Gra∣titude
K. <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip</HI> cannot but be in the Interest
of his Grandfather as long as he lives. But
let us inquire here into some things, which may
take off the Force of these Obligations, as to
the Argument before us</P>
<P>1. In a Treaty to establish K. <HI>Philip,</HI> may not
such Limitations, Provisions, and Restrictions,
be made, <HI>and that with the Consent of</HI> France,
as may for the future make K. <HI>Philip</HI> entirely
dependant upon the Allies, and independant
upon <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>2. Will not the K. of <HI>France,</HI> to establish his
Grandson, rather give him up so far to the Con∣federates,
as to make him their entire Ally and
Confederate, than not give him a quiet Posses∣sion
of his Kingdom?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
3. A firm Peace being established between
the 3 Crowns, may not this be so far from an
Injury to <HI>France,</HI> that it will seem to preserve
that Alliance and Peace, if <HI>France</HI> be at all sin∣cere
in making it?</P>
<P>4. May not this Dependance of <HI>Spain</HI> upon
the Confederates, consist so much in the preser∣ving
and supporting <HI>Spain</HI> in the peaceable Pos∣session
of all its remote Possessions from any In∣vader,
as well <HI>German,</HI> or even hereafter of
<HI>French,</HI> as may make it the Advantage of <HI>Spain</HI>
to continue it.</P>
<P>Again in a Treaty to establish <HI>Philip</HI> V.
may not such Securities be given to <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> for the Safety of their Commerce, as
may put them out of Danger of any Encroach∣ment
from <HI>France,</HI> and will not King <HI>Philip</HI> find
it his Interest, to give those Securities.</P>
<P>Some Observations on this Head of Trade
may explain this.</P>
<P>1. It is most certain, that the National In∣terest
of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> can never Unite, by
National Interest are understood.</P>
<P>1. Those of Dominion.</P>
<P>2. Those of Commerce.</P>
<P>Those of Dominion are too many and too
long to mention here, and respect the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Possessions in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> where it can
never be the Interest of <HI>Spain</HI> to let <HI>France</HI> set
her Foot, but of that I cannot enlarge here.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
Only I may say, that as two Kingdoms, they
will be ever Jealous of one another in both these
Places, nor will the relative Obligation last a
Moment longer than the Life of the present
King of <HI>France,</HI> for Interest of State always pre∣vails
against Interest of Blood, and Brothers
will no longer agree, than their Governments
agree.</P>
<P>But, come we next to the Interest of Com∣merce,
and here we know, let King <HI>Plilip</HI> de∣sire,
or design what he will, the People of <HI>Spain</HI>
can never, nay the Government of <HI>Spain</HI> can
never either agree with <HI>France,</HI> or differ with
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>1. The <HI>French</HI> in Trade can do nothing to
engage <HI>Spain,</HI> nor any thing but to injure and
impoverish her. This appears in two Things.
<HI>First, France</HI> cannot take off any one thing of
the Produce of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is considerable. The
Wine, the Brandy, the Oil, the Fruit of <HI>Spain,</HI>
with which so great a Trade is driven to <HI>En∣gland</HI>
and <HI>Holland;</HI> in <HI>France</HI> it must all go to
the Dunghill, they could not tell what else to
do with it▪ even the Wool, they can in <HI>France</HI>
make use but of a very small Part of it. But as to
Wine, Oil, Fruit <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Southern Part of
<HI>France</HI> abound with them, and supply almost
all the rest of this Part of the World.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>French</HI> taking the Liberty of Trade
to the <HI>Spanish West Indies,</HI> is a Grievance <HI>Spain</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
it self will never bear; and <HI>France</HI> must give it
up, or I question much, if <HI>Philip</HI> could ever
maintain himself upon his Throne, even <HI>Spain</HI>
it self would fly in his Face, and fly to the Con∣federates
for help to dislodge them.</P>
<P>These two things, if there were no other,
will make <HI>Philip</HI> as much a <HI>Spaniard</HI> in one
Year after a Peace, as he is by the Necessity
of the War a <HI>French-man</HI> now: perhaps indeed
Duty and the Debt above mentioned, may
tend to preserve a Deference and Regard from
King <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> during the Life of his
Grandfather; and how far will this carry him,
truly only to represent in Civil and obliging
Dutiful Terms, what his Subjects insist on, and
to request his Grandfather to make him easy on
the Throne, he exalted him to, by keeping up
the Boundaries of the Nations from any En∣crochments,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> may not com∣plain,
that instead of being Subjects to a King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> they are Vassals to, and dependent u∣pon
a King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But if there be any Occasion for any Thing
of this kind, after the Decease of the present King
of <HI>France,</HI> and King <HI>Philip</HI> comes to solicite these
things of his Brother, <HI>Lewis</HI> XV. he will then
talk in another Stile, Demand them of Right, in∣sist
upon the Demand, and do him self Justice
if deny'd; if the <HI>French</HI> shall resent it, and at∣tempt
to force him to any Compli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce; What
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
then? He immediately has recourse to <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> and so you are as you were in the
World.</P>
<P>The Sum of this Matter is, we have nothing
to do, but to tye up <HI>France</HI> to Securities against
Encroachments, and upon who? not upon the
Confederates, for that will be sufficiently secu∣red
by Surrender of Towns, Barriers, and Fron∣tiers;
but against Encroachment upon <HI>Spain,</HI> that
King <HI>Philip</HI> may be a free Prince, entirely Indepen∣dent
upon <HI>France,</HI> and then leave the Interest of
his Kingdom to Work the rest. There is no
Room left to argue it, the Natural Consequences
of his being King of <HI>Spain,</HI> will be, that he shall
be an Enemy to <HI>France,</HI> the National Interests of
the Two Kingdoms are Incompatible and can∣not
be Reconciled, they never were, they never
can be brought to Consist with one another.</P>
<P>It might be expected, that I should add the
natural Antipathies of the People, which in all
things, have so separated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the
<HI>French,</HI> that the Aversions which proceed from
thence, are considerably Instrumental in propa∣gating
a Separation of Interest. But I do not
think this so material an Article as some People
imagin, the Policy of <HI>France,</HI> may go a great way
to Naturalize the Nations one to another, and to
remove those Natural Aversions, introducing
themselves gradually, and bringing the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
off by Art and Management from their Stiffness
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
and Formalities, and by little and little, accusto∣ming
them to the Manners and Fashions of their
Neighbours. I do not therefore lay so great
Stress upon the natural Antipathies of the <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Spaniards</HI> one to another, as some People do;
at the same time, I do not deny, but such things
may Influence something in this Case, and sway
the People by their Inclination with the more
readiness to fall in with their real Interest, when
it suits their National Temper as much as it
does their Interest.</P>
<P>But when we come to speak of the Political
and Real Interest of a Nation, the Article of In∣clination
and Temper in the People, is a thing so
trifling, as it need have no Influence in the Case.
The Interest of <HI>Spain</HI> as to Trade, can never agree
with that of <HI>France.</HI> The Latter indeed may a∣gree
with the Former, <HI>France</HI> may gain by a
Trade with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as they make a hap∣py
return of Plate, Bullion, and Ready Money,
for what they carry to <HI>Spain;</HI> but <HI>Spain</HI> would
starve, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e undone.</P>
<P>The only advantageous Trade <HI>Spain</HI> can drive
in the World, out of themselves, is to <HI>England</HI>
and to <HI>Holland:</HI> Hither they export 30000 Pipes
of <HI>Canary,</HI> 5000 Butts of <HI>Sherry,</HI> and 10000 Pipes
of <HI>Tent, Alicant, Malaga,</HI> and <HI>Barcelona</HI> Wines, a
year: Hither they load a vast Quantity of Oil, of
Fruit, of <HI>Indico,</HI> and of Cocheneal, which <HI>France</HI>
can do little in, or take little or nothing of.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47" MS="y"/>
If then in the Treaty making, or to be made,
<HI>France</HI> can offer any Securities against undue En∣croachments
upon the Commerce of <HI>Spain,</HI> in
order to give a new turn to the Advantage of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>If our Commerce thither can be secured in
its Native Course and Freedom without Inter∣ruption,
Partiality, and Imposition.</P>
<P>If Civil Encroachments are provided against
in the Government of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
kept out of the <HI>Spanish West Indies.</HI></P>
<P>If all these things can be adjusted with <HI>France,</HI>
and every thing le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to its Native Channel, there
is no need for us to be alarm'd at the giving <HI>Spain</HI>
and the <HI>Indies</HI> to K. <HI>Philip:</HI> For the Interest of
Trade, of Government, and of Policy, will all
run against <HI>France;</HI> the Nation will be as much
ours as ever; and K. <HI>Philip</HI> and his Posterity be
as much <HI>Spaniards</HI> in a very short time as ever
<HI>Philip</HI> II. was, or any of his other Predecessors.</P>
